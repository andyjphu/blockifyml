Bitcoin probably isn’t going anywhere,Buttcoin,1i9toyk,2025-01-25 13:39:36,13,0.88,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1i9toyk/bitcoin_probably_isnt_going_anywhere/,Additional-Rip-7410,,"I’m the guy that’s writing the research paper on bitcoin. The more I think about what bitcoin is and what people are trying to utilize it for the more I think that this is probably here to stay 

I don’t agree with Bitcoin. Buying money with money is fundamentally unsound, and buying bitcoin makes less sense than buying gold, but I understand what they are trying to accomplish.  

The bitcoin guys think that bitcoin is a better version of gold. I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority of bitcoin maximalists used to invest in precious metals. I at the very least know of one maximalist who was very big on buying silver before bitcoin came around.

Regardless of if bitcoin is here to stay, a lot of these guys are playing a very dangerous game. More often I’m seeing posts about people liquidating their 401(k) and putting it into bitcoin.  Like all investments there’s a chance that you’re wrong about the thesis entirely.  And like all investments and markets, there will be a day where you’re down a significant amount of money.  When this day comes, many will be wiped out when they need it the most, especially if they’re trading on margin.

To me buying bitcoin doesn’t make any more sense than buying gold. The best you can expect any unproductive asset to perform is in direct proportion to inflation, but wouldn’t you want to do better than that?   There’s obviously a lot of speculation around bitcoin currently and maybe it is the next “big thing,” but regardless, I will not be participating."

I'm part of a team that's been working on a project called **Paymento**, a non-custodial crypto payment gateway designed to empower wallets to function as business gateways. Our goal is to simplify crypto payments while ensuring users retain full control over their funds.

We're eager to gather feedback from this knowledgeable community. Specifically, we're interested in:

* Your thoughts on the importance of non-custodial solutions in crypto payments.
* Insights into multi-chain support and its significance for businesses.
* Any challenges you've encountered with crypto payment gateways that we should be aware of.

Your feedback would be invaluable as we continue to refine and improve the platform. If you're interested in learning more or providing feedback, feel free to check out our recent [Product Hunt launch](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/paymento).

I’m only 19 and financially well-off because I’ve been working a lot lately alongside my studies.
The only thing I want to understand before investing is why so many people are pessimistic about cryptocurrencies, calling them scams and all that. Is there any solid reason for them to think this way? I get that you guys will probably have a bit of pro-bitcoin bias, but come on, if Bitcoin works, I could make a ton of money. And if I lose 1,000€, it’s frustrating but not the end of the world. It’s an amount I can afford to lose, and I don’t enjoy buying unnecessary goods anyway, my money is just sleeping in my bank account.
I’m very confident about cryptocurrencies and truly believe in their future. I strongly believe cryptocurrencies are the future of finance and technology. My main concern for cryptocurrencies is the potential impact of a major war or catastrophic global event, but I don’t think a severe financial collapse would completely destroy the bitcoin in the long run.

In a dramatic turn of events, French authorities successfully rescued David Balland, the co-founder of the renowned crypto hardware wallet company Ledger, after he was kidnapped from his home in central France. The incident unfolded early Tuesday morning when Balland and his partner were abducted, sparking a high-stakes police operation.

The kidnappers, in a chilling move, demanded a substantial ransom in cryptocurrency, highlighting the growing trend of crypto-related crimes. However, their plan was thwarted by the swift and coordinated efforts of French law enforcement, including the elite GIGN tactical unit. Part of the ransom was paid as part of negotiations, but most of the crypto assets were traced, frozen, and seized by the authorities.

Balland endured physical abuse during his captivity, including a hand mutilation, while his partner was found tied up in a car. The rescue operation culminated in the arrest of 10 suspects, nine men and one woman, most of whom were known to police for past criminal activities.

This incident underscores the vulnerabilities faced by high-profile individuals in the crypto sector and the need for enhanced security measures. Ledger, known for its innovative hardware wallets, has been a target due to its significant role in the crypto industry.

As the crypto world continues to evolve, this case serves as a wake-up call for prioritizing personal security alongside technological innovation. The crypto community must grapple with the risks inherent in this space and work towards stronger safeguards to protect its key players.

I think our community is great and Sloth a huge opportunity. I am always impressed by individuals who not only have ideas but also implement them straight away. Then there are others who constantly call for the developers and are annoyed that they don't want to appear. 
Have you also thought about the fact that the developers might never show themelves? It's a long shot but Bitcoin works without its developers...
Now to the actual topic - the reason why I'm writing this:
I know how software development works and have already implemented numerous platforms as a project manager. However, just imagine we are developing a concept for a joint E-Commerce platform or exchange that enables us to offer exclusive products (could be a service, art, tickets, VIP club memberships, software etc.). I know that there are already many creative people in our community who could contribute to this. The only accepted payment method would be SLOTH. Let's define the value of SLOTH together as a community. The focus would of course be on user friendliness, reliability, transparency and establishing SLOTH as a object of exchange. Help users to acquire SLOTH by offering a simple onboarding solution (can be done through a partnership with crypto exchanges or by integrating a function that allows users to by SLOTH directly on the platform etc.).
I believe that we as a community can really implement this without the developers. 
What do you think, are we as a community able to implement such a project and create a need that can only be met by using SLOTH?
I look forward to your input."

Go look at the article for Walter. and then the Wikipedia article for New Economic System, which is linked there. 

I had wiki links in my post on /bitcoin and also posted a btc address hoping they would maybe send me some for doing research on their little project lol. Probably a no-go on all of /r/ ? To be honest I'm skeptical about almost everything and have had my temptations to mess around in the space but have never owned any.  
Lately I see what's happening now (and has been for years) is the idea of making money is being sold. It's worse than MLM in many ways. And MLM is awful. I know someone who is telling people to buy as much as they can and it's so cheesy and basement mlm scheme like. Like selling you a ""job"" which turns out to not be a job.

Every wizard’s journey begins with a spark—a sudden realization that the fiat system is, well, as magical as a soggy wand. The Bitcoin network offers something better: decentralization, transparency, and a community of like-minded sorcerers (okay, maybe we call them developers, traders, and miners).

But here’s the catch—cryptocurrency isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a world where digital alchemy turns trust into transactions and where QR codes are your enchanted runes. That’s where the Bitcoin QR Code API comes in. It’s your staff of power, allowing you to wield the blockchain with grace, efficiency, and a flair for the dramatic.

# Lesson 2: Mastering the QR Code Spell

What’s a Bitcoin wizard without a spell? In our case, the spell is the QR code—a deceptively simple black-and-white matrix that can carry the weight of a thousand satoshis. These magical glyphs are your gateway to seamless transactions, enabling anyone with a smartphone to scan and pay faster than you can say “Hocus Pocus.”

Our [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) takes this spell to the next level. Whether you’re running an e-commerce store, managing a fundraiser, or just flexing your developer muscles, this API helps you generate Bitcoin QR codes with ease. Think of it as your trusty grimoire—it works quietly in the background, but its power is undeniable.

# Lesson 3: Crafting Magical Use Cases

Every good wizard knows how to use their tools creatively. Here are a few enchanting ideas for the Bitcoin QR Code API:

1. **The Merchant’s Charm** Running a shop? Use QR codes to accept Bitcoin payments at lightning speed. No fiddling with wallets, no confusion—just scan, pay, and poof, transaction complete.
2. **The Charitable Enchantment** Fundraising for a cause? QR codes make it easy for donors to contribute in Bitcoin. A scan and a tap later, their donation is on its way.
3. **The Developer’s Elixir** Building a decentralized app? Integrate the Bitcoin QR Code API for frictionless payment processing. Your users will thank you for the wizardry.
4. **The Party Trick** Hosting a crypto-themed event? Use QR codes to collect ticket payments or even as giveaways. Watch as your attendees marvel at your blockchain sorcery.

# Lesson 4: Decoding the Wizard’s Toolbox

You might be wondering, “What makes this Bitcoin QR Code API so special?” Well, let me enlighten you:

* **Simplicity**: No need for an advanced degree in cryptography. The API is designed to be user-friendly, even if your last coding project was a “Hello World” app.
* **Customization**: Personalize your QR codes to reflect your brand or style. Add colors, logos, and more to make your QR codes pop.
* **Speed**: In the fast-paced world of Bitcoin, every second counts. The API generates QR codes faster than you can say “blockchain.”
* **Security**: The API ensures your transactions are safe and secure. No sneaky goblins tampering with your funds here.

# Lesson 5: Overcoming Common Wizarding Challenges

Every aspiring wizard faces challenges on their journey. Here are a few pitfalls to avoid:

1. **The “Oops, Wrong Address” Curse** Double-check those QR codes! One tiny mistake, and your Bitcoin could end up in the abyss. The API minimizes errors, but a little caution goes a long way.
2. **The “Tech Hex”** Not a coding expert? Fear not! The Bitcoin QR Code API comes with documentation so clear, even a Muggle could understand it.
3. **The “Overwhelm Spell”** The crypto world can be daunting. Take it one step at a time. Start small, experiment with the API, and soon you’ll be casting complex payment spells with ease.

# Lesson 6: The Future of Bitcoin Wizardry

The beauty of Bitcoin wizardry lies in its infinite potential. As more people adopt cryptocurrency, the demand for seamless, secure transactions will only grow. By mastering tools like the Bitcoin QR Code API, you position yourself at the forefront of this digital revolution.

Picture this: a world where your QR codes power vending machines, enable micropayments, and even unlock doors (okay, maybe not literal doors, but certainly doors of opportunity). The possibilities are as vast as a dragon’s treasure hoard.

# Lesson 7: Joining the Wizarding Community

No wizard works alone. The Bitcoin ecosystem is brimming with fellow spellcasters eager to share knowledge, trade tips, and collaborate on magical projects. Join forums, attend meetups, and never stop learning. The more you engage, the more powerful your spells will become.

And don’t forget to share your creations! Show off your Bitcoin QR code-powered projects and inspire others to embrace the magic of cryptocurrency.

# Final Exam: Your First Spell

Ready to test your skills? Head over to [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) and start experimenting. Whether it’s for personal use or a grand project, you’ll quickly see how this tool can transform your crypto experience.

# Epilogue: From Apprentice to Master

Becoming a Bitcoin wizard isn’t just about tools and transactions—it’s about embracing a mindset of curiosity, innovation, and empowerment. With the Bitcoin QR Code API by your side, you’re not just participating in the crypto revolution—you’re leading it.

So go forth, young wizard. Create, explore, and share your magic with the world. And remember, every time someone scans your QR code, you’re casting a spell that bridges the gap between technology and possibility.✨"

Best 3 Cryptos Under $1 To Buy This Week: Doge Uprising Could Be The Best Meme Coin Of 2025,draqai,1i9rbei,2025-01-25 11:56:57,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i9rbei/best_3_cryptos_under_1_to_buy_this_week_doge/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 Hot Picks for Crypto Lovers: 3 Tokens Under $1 to Watch This Week  

Guess what, crypto fam? It’s the perfect time to hunt for those low-cost tokens that can turn you into the next *to-the-moon* success story. This week’s must-watch trio is sizzling: $DUP (Doge Uprising), $TRX (Tron), and Arbitrum. Let me spill the tea!  

Doge Uprising is creating some massive buzz right now. Currently in Stage 3 of its presale, $DUP is priced at just fractions of a cent. So what makes it special? It’s a meme coin, but with utility dripping in ambition—staking capabilities, an NFT marketplace, and all the viral appeal you could dream of. Early buyers are already piling in, and if the hype keeps soaring, $DUP could overshadow other meme coins by 2025. I mean, imagine flexing your gains this time next year... spicy, right?  

Meanwhile, let’s not forget about $TRX! Tron continues being a classic darling for decentralized applications. Reliable, consistent, and super cheap—perfect for stacking up in your bag for steady returns.  

Then we have Arbitrum, the tech genius among the trio. If Ethereum is your bae but those gas fees make you wanna scream, Arbitrum’s Layer 2 solution keeps things fast and wallet-friendly. While it may not have the meme coin vibe, it’s all about building solid, long-term value.  

But let’s be real... Doge Uprising is the one making everyone raise their eyebrows (and investments). The combo of cheap entry points, staking possibilities, and an irresistible meme factor makes $DUP seriously worth considering.  

Crypto season is all about being smart *and* spicy with your picks. So don’t sleep on these gems. Secure that bag and start dreaming of 2025 as your breakout year.

Bitcoin/etn + microstrategy = troppa esposizione o diversificazione?,ItaliaPersonalFinance,1i9r5cb,2025-01-25 11:49:29,1,0.56,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaPersonalFinance/comments/1i9r5cb/bitcoinetn_microstrategy_troppa_esposizione_o/,micheledoors,Portafoglio e Investimenti,"ancora non ho acquistato nulla, ma volendosi esporre al mondo crypto, come da titolo, vorrei capire se detenere Bitcoin e / o avere un ETF in bitcoin , e/o aggiungere l'azione di un'azienda che dovrebbe detenere il corrispettivo investito ( se ho capito bene ) come Microstrategy rientri nella diversificazione o nell'eccesos di esposizione.

Mi spiego meglio:  
Poniamo il caso che, io credo fortemente nei btc  e cripto in genere, e al tempo stesso voglio anche speculare, la strategia migliore quale sarebbe ? investire tutto in un aspetto es: detenere bitcoin reali e vendere di tanto in tanto, nonostante la tax a 33%.  
Oppure una parte detenerla per non pagarci mai tasse a lunghissimo termine  - prima o poi magari cambia - ed una parte sfruttarla tramite etn/azioni mcrs per approfittare dell'oscillazione ?

spero di essere stato chiaro, magari non mi sono espresso molto bene. però quello che penso e ho capito da studi effettuati, che comunque avere un azion dell'azienda o l'etf non è proprio come detenere il btc fisico, quindi è differente a livello di ""prodotto reale"" e quindi di come dire ""credo"" nel progetto ?!"

Hence I am looking for feedback from all the smart folks on this subreddit whos advice i read all the time for setting the best possible strategy.

 Here's my situation:

* I’ve got about **50k CHF** in IBKR right now 
* this is not my only pot of money, I have a fair bit chunk of money invested through my swiss bank (UBS) and another private bank (Kaiser Partners) which is fortunately giving me good returns
* **My risk tolerance is high** for this type of investment, as I see IBKR is a sort of an experiment to see how things go, perhaps I could move more money into it at some point but not soon as I still prefer to keep my money safe in Switzerland
*  Going forward I plan to invest additional **2K per month,** starting from April/May
* Although I prone to risk, I do not have the time to play with stocks or bitcoins so I am focusing on **low-cost ETFs**, possibly **avoiding some overlap** between them**,** but not necessarily 
* I’m also setting aside **2.5k CHF** for active stock trades.

My initial plan is:

\- 70% VT

\- 15% VOO

\- 15% QQQM

thanks in advance for your feedback!!"
