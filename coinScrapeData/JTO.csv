Section IV.M.2.a.xxv: Jito Network (JTO)  
  
Jito Network (JTO) - Catalyzing Change in Solana's DeFi Through Staking and MEV  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into the recent developments of Jito Network (JTO), highlighting its transformative impact on the Solana ecosystem. JTO's journey from its airdrop event to its strategic listing on major exchanges like Coinbase has not only increased its market presence but also underscored its role in advancing liquid staking and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) strategies. We explore how JTO's initiatives have fostered significant community engagement through governance proposals, thereby shaping the future of staking on Solana. The paper assesses JTO's market performance, analyzing price trends, liquidity, and the broader implications for Solana's DeFi sector. Additionally, we scrutinize Jito Network's approach to MEV optimization and its potential to redefine economic models within blockchain networks. The analysis concludes with insights into JTO's growth trajectory and its prospective influence on the evolving landscape of decentralized finance.

Is the Airdrop Meta Over?
Late last year, the airdrop farming meta became the meta in the crypto markets. After even small farmers earned $10K+ from the Jito airdrop, everyone was looking for the next Jito.

Image
JTO tokens were worth between $2-4 in the 24 hours after launch.
Although there have been other lucrative airdrops since then, like Dymension and Wormhole, few have been able to find returns comparable to Jito‚Äôs $10k+ drop. In fact, many have been left disappointed - large protocols were over-farmed, and in several cases the terms of the airdrops set by protocol teams weren‚Äôt as favorable as many farmers would have hoped.


Billions of dollars farmed for 5% of the EIGEN supply. Note that since their initial announcement, they‚Äôve changed some terms of the airdrop, including extending the lock-up for investors.
Consensus across the timeline would say that the airdrop farming meta is over, but I‚Äôm not so sure.

Airdrop farming won‚Äôt be easy moving forward, but because so many farmers have thrown in the towel, finding the right protocol to farm for an airdrop might be more profitable than ever.

To start, many ‚Äòdisappointing‚Äô airdrops might have overcorrected after launch, leaving them currently undervalued.


The market quickly realized this with the Friend.tech airdrop. After dumping to less than $0.90, FRIEND is up 200%. All FRIEND supply is already circulating.


I‚Äôll be on the lookout for airdrop opportunities as the herd walks away. It only takes one big airdrop to rake in some serious money. Additionally, consider that the crypto market has broadly seen downside volatility the past month. Market participants tend to take less risk (some of them, at least) and ‚Äòfree money‚Äô airdrops are often the first to be sold in a downturn."

Re: Post to be careful regarding scams etc,

I'm trying to workout which are bullshlagen & which are real?

I never saw Drako till this morning, is the Malfoys side scam ?  & Honey boxes, well that's what was a trap in the old networks, leave 1 server with access & fill it with viruses & malware 

Q4 awards? for what I cant run swim, or even anything else gotta be a stitch-up, right?

Mycelium make me think of, The last of us!? has it started is it here? might have come with the Aliens ? isnt it?

Mate you try & make some coin,  and no sooner people make coin, there are those coming up behind to take it.

If you gotten this far, if anyone has sometime to waste on me a few seconds, how many are scams? & how can you remove from your wallet?

Thanks

The % tokens circulating is good. 

Anybody have a bull and bear thesis on these? I am considering swapping some $SOL for $SHDW, $NOS and $BONK as leverage plays since $SOL has pumped hard and arguably only has a 5x from here. 

Also considering to swap $JTO/$PYTH for $MNADE because the market caps appear to be overvalued and undervalued respectively. Marinade Finance has more TVL than Jito.

Thoughts?

Marinade Finance has a TVL of $1.24 billion, whereas Jito had a TVL of $726 million.

Jito (JTO) has a higher market capitalization and token price than Marinade Finance (MNDE), which means it has more demand and valuation. 

So, it has less marketcap but it is more expensive.

Jito (JTO) offers a lower annual percentage yield (APY) than Marinade Finance (MNDE), which means it has less rewards for staking Solana (SOL). 6.9% APY for jito versus 9.1% APY for marinade.

Jito (JTO) has some additional features that Marinade Finance (MNDE) does not have, such as its block building engine and MEV infrastructure, which could give it an edge in the long term. Jito also had a successful token launch and airdrop, which boosted its popularity and exposure.

Sentiment is on jito's side and it is on binance and coinbase, but marinade is only on coinbase. Feel free to add technical analysis, perhaps something weekly.

üì∑ Those who staked [$sol](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24sol&src=cashtag_click) to Jito [$jto](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24jto&src=cashtag_click) earned at least ""5k-10k$"" from the Airdrop. Yes, you read it right: 5000$ -10000$ üì∑   
Currently #Airdrop Hype has shifted to Solana and I and many others are moving to MarginFi which could be the next [$jto](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24jto&src=cashtag_click)!  
**How to farm MarginFi** **Airdrop in \~10min** üì∑    
Want to be eligible for the upcoming [**@marginfi**](https://twitter.com/marginfi) **airdrop**? Follow these steps to farm the **airdrop** through their **points system** and earn your share of the growing ecosystem on Solana.   


 Step 1: Log in to MarginFi via Phantom or Solflare Wallet.  
 [https://app.marginfi.com/](https://www.mfi.gg/refer/922708e8-f791-40b7-a21c-c26d879bfae4)   


https://preview.redd.it/9jmy0h0maz4c1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=45214c892cd69a6365dfdc18a43501d5655f38a0

 Step 2: Head over to the ""Lend"" section and navigate to the SOL module. This is where you'll start your farming journey. Our goal is to start earning points by lending SOL and borrowing mSol (points are aggregated based on a per dollar basis).   


https://preview.redd.it/hzdceqjoaz4c1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=8104363e4a6c51c768f69e6c795af2640804b49a

 Step 3: Enter the amount of SOL you want to lend (for example 25 SOL, you'll generate around 9.5K points per day)  Select ""Supply"" and decline the message for converting to LST.  


https://preview.redd.it/iliw7l1vaz4c1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=05c82a8935c2feb152dbd9187e1f4ec0acff93e3

 Some will stop at this point,  now obtaining points towards the airdrop eligibility. To increase the points we earn daily, we can also follow steps #4-6!  
Step 4: Now, let's move to the ""Borrow"" section. Select mSOL and borrow the maximum amount (50% of your lending value in $).  Points will now be accruing from both our SOL lend + mSOL borrowed.  


https://preview.redd.it/wlcdy2pyaz4c1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=b56f1c8fea6e6a97c1c2b227bec9d48ae8ec2d33

 Step 5: Once you have your mSOL, head over to [http://jup.ag](https://jup.ag/) to convert them into SOL. We're almost there!    


https://preview.redd.it/85ul2tzlbz4c1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa53d47fd40e2a61815f938d14a2a6e848e61f3

 Step 6: Finally, return to the ""Lend"" section on Margin Fi and lend your SOL again. This completes one cycle of farming!   
[https://app.marginfi.com/](https://www.mfi.gg/refer/922708e8-f791-40b7-a21c-c26d879bfae4)

 Remember, the more cycles you repeat, the higher your liquidation price will increase, but by lending and borrowing SOL and mSOL, liquidation can only occur via depegging, making this the safest way to obtain points. üì∑ I recommend 1-2 cycles to ensure no issues, but 3+ is possible.  


Once the cycle(s) are executed, sit back, relax, and wait for the airdrop as you earn points. To withdraw your assets/gains, follow the same path but in reverse! Happy farming!"

üì∑ Those who staked [$sol](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24sol&src=cashtag_click) to Jito [$jto](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24jto&src=cashtag_click) earned at least ""5k-10k$"" from the Airdrop. Yes, you read it right: 5000$ -10000$ üì∑   
Currently #Airdrop Hype has shifted to Solana and I and many others are moving to MarginFi which could be the next [$jto](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24jto&src=cashtag_click)!  
**How to farm MarginFi** **Airdrop in \~10min** üì∑    
Want to be eligible for the upcoming [**@marginfi**](https://twitter.com/marginfi) **airdrop**? Follow these steps to farm the **airdrop** through their **points system** and earn your share of the growing ecosystem on Solana.   


 Step 1: Log in to MarginFi via Phantom or Solflare Wallet.  
 [https://app.marginfi.com/](https://www.mfi.gg/refer/922708e8-f791-40b7-a21c-c26d879bfae4)   


https://preview.redd.it/9jmy0h0maz4c1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=45214c892cd69a6365dfdc18a43501d5655f38a0

 Step 2: Head over to the ""Lend"" section and navigate to the SOL module. This is where you'll start your farming journey. Our goal is to start earning points by lending SOL and borrowing mSol (points are aggregated based on a per dollar basis).   


https://preview.redd.it/hzdceqjoaz4c1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=8104363e4a6c51c768f69e6c795af2640804b49a

 Step 3: Enter the amount of SOL you want to lend (for example 25 SOL, you'll generate around 9.5K points per day)  Select ""Supply"" and decline the message for converting to LST.  


https://preview.redd.it/iliw7l1vaz4c1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=05c82a8935c2feb152dbd9187e1f4ec0acff93e3

 Some will stop at this point,  now obtaining points towards the airdrop eligibility. To increase the points we earn daily, we can also follow steps #4-6!  
Step 4: Now, let's move to the ""Borrow"" section. Select mSOL and borrow the maximum amount (50% of your lending value in $).  Points will now be accruing from both our SOL lend + mSOL borrowed.  


https://preview.redd.it/wlcdy2pyaz4c1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=b56f1c8fea6e6a97c1c2b227bec9d48ae8ec2d33

 Step 5: Once you have your mSOL, head over to [http://jup.ag](https://jup.ag/) to convert them into SOL. We're almost there!    


https://preview.redd.it/85ul2tzlbz4c1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa53d47fd40e2a61815f938d14a2a6e848e61f3

 Step 6: Finally, return to the ""Lend"" section on Margin Fi and lend your SOL again. This completes one cycle of farming!   
[https://app.marginfi.com/](https://www.mfi.gg/refer/922708e8-f791-40b7-a21c-c26d879bfae4)

 Remember, the more cycles you repeat, the higher your liquidation price will increase, but by lending and borrowing SOL and mSOL, liquidation can only occur via depegging, making this the safest way to obtain points. üì∑ I recommend 1-2 cycles to ensure no issues, but 3+ is possible.  


Once the cycle(s) are executed, sit back, relax, and wait for the airdrop as you earn points. To withdraw your assets/gains, follow the same path but in reverse! Happy farming! "

Jito, the second largest protocol on Solana by total value locked, debuted its new governance token Thursday, continuing the recent trend of airdrops on the layer 1 blockchain.¬†

The airdrop to Jito community members acts ‚Äúas a recognition of their contribution in bootstrapping the network and to facilitate robust governance participation,‚Äù according to a [blog post](https://www.jito.network/blog/announcing-jto-the-jito-governance-token/).¬†¬†

JTO gives token holders voting power over Jito‚Äôs decentralized autonomous organization by allowing them to vote on proposals about staking pool fees, treasury management and contributions for ongoing development.¬†

The token is currently exchanging hands at $2.04, [data](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jito) from CoinGecko shows, and has a market cap of $242 million. Several centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Bybit and MEXC have already listed JTO for trading.¬†

The token‚Äôs debut comes amid a revival in the Solana ecosystem. Solana‚Äôs total value locked ‚Äì the amount of crypto assets deposited into the blockchain ‚Äì has increased 115% in the past 30 days to around $700 million, per [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chains), vastly outpacing several other blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Tron. Jito‚Äôs token was launched roughly two weeks after a different Solana-based airdrop, namely blockchain oracle firm Pyth.¬†

The airdropped tokens have an 18-month claiming window and make up 10% of the total JTO supply. Unclaimed tokens funnel into a treasury governed by Jito‚Äôs DAO, overseen by JTO holders.¬†

Jito, which launched in late 2022, is a liquid staking platform that aims to let users stake SOL tokens, which are locked up in validators to secure the Solana blockchain. It also, and provides liquidity to stakers by issuing JitoSOL, the protocol‚Äôs liquid staking token that represents the user‚Äôs initial deposit and accrued rewards.¬†"

I've been on the lookout for something more user-friendly and maybe more rewarding. Just noticed that a lot of people have started talking about Jito protocol as one of the reliable alternatives and with token rewards for stakers in the form of JTO.

I also saw that there's gonna be multiple airdrop for the project:

1. The project team seems to be given airdrops spanning 18 months according to their website,
2. There's another deposit-to-earn on Bitget.

My question is, how reliable is this MEV protocol for staking?  "
