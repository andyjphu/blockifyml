Does someone work or worked as EO in Revenue via public jobs?
How is it? Do you like/recommend?

It seems a 6-months training is mandatory and then another 6 months of working before passing probation. 
Is it a hybrid job after the training?

Thanks!!!"

What's the best travel camera?,AskPhotography,1i9x60w,2025-01-25 16:11:32,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhotography/comments/1i9x60w/whats_the_best_travel_camera/,user273649,Buying Advice,"Hey! I know this has been spoken about a lot but there are so many different options and opinions on the topic that I'm not sure where to start. For some context, I'm an A Level student who takes photography as a subject. I currently shoot with a Canon EOS 90D, usually with the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM lens mainly doing architecture/nature photography. 

As the title says I'm looking for a camera to take traveling. I'd mainly use it for general architecture/landscapes, but id also quite like to be able to do some portraiture. The main thing that I'm interested in is photograph quality (and it being able to shoot in RAW), I'm not so fussed on things like zoom and video quality. I'd quite like a point and shoot kind of camera if that makes sense.

I usually buy my gear second hand from MPB, and am looking to spend a max of around £950, but would rather spend a lot less. 

Any opinion is appreciated so much, thank youuuu :)

Apparently, there was a limited number of copies. They said on X they announced it was limited.
Problem is, the $149 box set above is the open order. No limit, same as every other preorder.
So now they’re trying to force us into buying all the other stuff that some of us don’t want or care about.

I was already thinking about it because of their predatory practices , this just seams the deal.
It being, I will not purchase any LRG games for Switch 2. I’m still going to collect, but only titles that can be ordered through normal retail outlets. If it’s LRG, so be it. 

I own every LRG Switch title. That ends at Switch 2. They’ve become exactly what every small, successful indie darling becomes.
Never forget, EA was founded by a bunch of Atari game designers that were getting screwed by the corporation.

LRG is a corporation, no longer interested in game preservation and all their other supposed virtues. Profit is all that matters.
There is no FOMO if one never engages, as I’ll be doing next generation.

P.S. I’m aware this might get published elsewhere. Also might not. But I’m not collecting $149 box sets of 25 year old games. Not sure I’d pay that for a Nintendo made Ocarina of Time box set. These people are insane."

Basically, my husband and I are both federal employees living in a HCOL area. As you can imagine, the onslaught of EOs are having a dramatic effect on our day to day lives. Not just the RTO, but there’s a very real chance one of us could lose our jobs, on top of a list of other things. We’re trying not to panic and instead come up with back up plans, but it’s very hard. We’re watching friends and neighbors spiraling around us. Overall a bad situation. 

Anyway, my parents are big Trump (and Musk) supporters. They’re good grandparents and our relationship has always been alright, but I wouldn’t exactly call them my best friends or nominate them from grandparents of the year awards. We’ve always been able to look past these differences in opinion but idk if I can do that anymore. My mom called me this morning and - thinking I could lean on my own mother - I started telling her how we’re really worried and struggling. She got extremely defensive and started spewing out what sounded like the headline ticker for Fox News. All kinds of racist, sexiest, and completely untrue claims including the typical bullshit of “Trump is going to save us” and “the democrats want the illegals to run the country” etc. It was shocking. I new their views were a little backwards, but I didn’t realize the deep level of hatred they held. She told me we’d have to “get over it” in reference to how difficult this administration is making our lives. I didn’t expect that at all. On top of it all, aside from myself and my husband being fed employees (and vets too), my brother is gay and my sister works a union job. I told her that it seems like they are putting their hatred for Democrats (or whatever other boogeyman Fox tells them to hate) over the well-being of their children. She hung up, and basically I don’t know where to go from here. I tried to write this as concisely as possible, but if anyone has any insight please let me know. I don’t necessarily want to cut them off forever, but I don’t know how I can get passed the…ignorance? Cruelty? Idk. "

[review request] esp32-c6 18650 solar powered sensor board,PrintedCircuitBoard,1i9wf4u,2025-01-25 15:38:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrintedCircuitBoard/comments/1i9wf4u/review_request_esp32c6_18650_solar_powered_sensor/,Individual_Age_5013,,"Hello All,

I want to order my first SMD pcb board soon.

I wanted to create a board that can charge an 18650 battery from USB and a small 6V solar panel. I'm using the BQ24074 charge controller for this.

It's the first time i'm drawing a board that is not using development modules, so it's my first experience with a bare esp32-WROOM module. Most of the schematic is assembled using examples on the internet, and from the application examples in the datasheets.

I will order it via easyEDA, so the ICs and components are partly based on what they have in stock.

To convert the power i'm using a buck/boost converter TPS631000.

The board also has a fuel gauge IC MAX17048 (because i want to experiment with the IC :-)). A level shifter TCA9517 was added to match the +3V3 of the esp32.

I integrated a cp2102n to program the esp32.

Since i want to do some tests with the power consumption of the board, i added all pull-up resistors for i2c lines as through-hole. this allows me to test if the internal pull-up resistors of the esp32 are ok to use.

I can completely disconnect the cp2102 from the +3,3V, RX and TX with jumpers.

my main concerns are:

Did i get all the strapping pins of the ESP32 correct?  
Are there any flaws in the PCB layout?  
Do i need to disconnect the rx/tx lines if the cp2102n is not powered via +3V3?

Could you give your opinion on the design before i order the PCBs?

The PCB layout can be opened from the oshw lab platform:
