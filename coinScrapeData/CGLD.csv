Dropping support for CGLD (Celo) makes Coinbase a small fortune?,CoinBase,1h6u2r1,2024-12-04 18:05:38,2,0.67,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1h6u2r1/dropping_support_for_cgld_celo_makes_coinbase_a/,penoleme,,"I'm sure to them it's not a fortune but...  I ""earned"" some CGLD ages ago through one of their earning programs.  Never touched it - now it's worth about $1.50.

Coinbase informs me they will no longer support it so, I gotta get it out of my account or lose it.  I don't give a crap about this coin so I sell it.

They take 50.7% of the proceeds as commission.

What a bunch of crap.  I also recently sold a ""tad bit"" of BTC -they took over $500.  They didn't do ANYTHING to earn that.  I bought low, sold high - that's some real money.

I get it.. it's their business model.  But I'm in the US and they are one of the legit exchanges but wow - greed like that makes me really want to search for something else (WHICH - they will take a cut for me to move the money dang it!!!).

If I hadn't made such a great return on the coins I lucked into buying, I wouldn't touch crypto.  Transaction costs are so huge...  I dabbled in gaming tokens, USD coin, etc. - every movement I made was 10X what I'd pay in a simple ATM charge at the bank.  Moving $50 USDC to a wallet shouldn't cost $10 or whatever it was.  "

My dashboard shows a correct amount, however the chart juts up at some point and shows completely unrelated, higher amount (which fluctuates). I have no idea why? The sum of assets fits the correct lower balance, however it still draws a higher amount on the chart and keeps doing this (while I put the cursor over the graph it shows the higher amount). I did no action to trigger it, the only thing that comes to mind I changed small amount od CGLD into Shib to get rid of CGLD as Coinbase Poland asked to withdraw from CGLD before it migrates to Celo (and I had around three bucks in that doin, so just changed into Shib).

"According to the Hyper Boom Portfolio crypto Celo (CELO) 5,000% Potential",Crypto_Portfolio_City,tnyy4y,2022-03-25 16:58:47,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_Portfolio_City/comments/tnyy4y/according_to_the_hyper_boom_portfolio_crypto_celo/,SquirrelStunning7777,,"

Assume a world in which there is no need for a physical bank, customer service, or any employee. That's no longer a far-fetched science-fiction fantasy. It is currently taking place.
We are witnessing the emergence of a brand-new distributed financial system growing up to parallel, and eventually rival, the old financial system in what may prove to be one of the most valuable use cases for blockchain.
I'm referring to decentralized finance (DeFi). And it will accomplish for finance what the internet has accomplished for so many other industries: it will replace a high-cost middleman with a low-cost one.

DeFi uses cutting-edge blockchain technology to reduce expenses by eliminating the need for trusted third parties.

It will eventually make banking. Borrowing, lending, and investing are becoming more accessible and affordable to billions of people.
 (CELO)
Celo provides access to public blockchain and financial services such as banking and lending to everyone globally who has a smartphone.

Celo is a mobile application that provides speed, transparency, and affordable expenses. It intends to lower one of the biggest barriers to entry into cryptography by using phone numbers as public keys instead of a long, random string of words and letters that is nearly difficult to memorize and far too easy to enter wrong.

There are over 4 billion smartphone users worldwide now. And Celo opens the door to new opportunities for every one of them. such as DeFi applications and payments.

But it will make a difference for individuals who cannot get traditional finance. Consider the approximately 2 billion adults worldwide who do not have access to financial services.
Two-thirds of these people own a smartphone, according to estimates. That equates to nearly 1 billion potential users who may use Celo to access financial services that were previously unavailable to them.

Celo has also received support and attention from several companies worldwide.
Over 140 projects and businesses are now expanding on its ecosystem.
One of its most recent collaborations is with Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecommunications provider by revenue, with over 242 million mobile clients.

Validators on the Celo network will be able to send verification text messages to the mobile carrier's users. This increases the security and dependability of decentralized phone verification, which is what makes the Celo blockchain so user-friendly.
T-Systems MMS, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, will also run a validator group to help secure the network and expand Celo's infrastructure.

Celo has received over $65 million in funding from a number of industry heavyweights, including Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Twitter and Square founder Jack Dorsey.

These are just a handful of the many institutions and individuals supporting Celo's mission to become the leading decentralized global payment infrastructure for entry-level customers.
The Celo Hyper Boom
Remember that a Hyper Boom occurs when a tremendous flood of new users into crypto.

Catch-Up Coins are among the most vulnerable to usage spikes. We locate the best Catch-Up Coins by investing in projects with high usage but a price action that is either moving down from its peak or trading sideways.
When CELO initially came to our attention, its price had dropped 70% from its April high. Its consumption has increased since then, and its price has risen...
As you can see, price activity does not tell the entire story.
CELO has now begun to rise, indicating that it is in the early stages of its Hyper Boom phase.
However, we believe there will be a far larger shift in the coming weeks as Celo opens its cross-chain bridge to Ethereum. Users will be able to move assets across the two networks as a result of this.

Historically, an effective bridge to Ethereum has proven to be a critical growth component for other blockchains. And we anticipate the same with Celo.
Optics is the name of the bridge. And its first point of contact will be with Ethereum. However, it also provides simple plug-in solutions for other chains. Following Ethereum, it will connect to key networks like Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, and others.
Combine this with the network's newly announced $100 million funds to jumpstart DeFi adoption on the Celo network, and we may expect huge growth in the coming years.

Aave, Curve, SushiSwap, Ox, Chainlink, and many other protocols are helping to grow the DeFi ecosystem on Celo. 
As you can see, Celo is swiftly approaching a vital point in its early adoption phase, providing us with an opportunity to jump in before the Hyper Boom really takes off.

What's It Worth?

As previously said, there are approximately 4 billion smartphone users. And 1.3 billion of them do not have access to banking services. As a result, they are great targets for Celo's services.
Let's imagine Celo can grab 15% of unbanked smartphone owners - or around 200 million people - over the next five years.
If each of them only made one transaction each day, the network would handle almost 73 billion transactions every year.

Now. Assume that each transaction costs one cent. It's also paid in CELO. This equates to a yearly demand for CELO of approximately $730 million.
We may compare CELO to Ethereum to get a feel of what this means for the price of CELO.

The month of August 2021 Transaction fees cost Ethereum users roughly $700 million. That equates to around $8.3 billion in annual demand for ETH.
Ethereum was valued at $404 billion at the end of August. This is around 49 times the annual demand for ETH ($404 billion / $8.3 billion = 48.7). 
Based on our projection, CELO's value would be around $35.5 billion ($730 million x 48.7) if we gave it the same multiple as Ethereum.
Based on the current token supply, each token would be worth $144.05 at a market cap of $35.5 billion... a 2,747 % rise from today's price.

That is sufficient to turn a $500 investment into $14,234. And every $1,000 invested becomes $28,468.
Remember, this estimate is based on Celo capturing 5% of smartphone users (banked and unbanked).

 If Celo could double its predicted market penetration rate... each CELO would be valued at $288.10 in a best-case scenario.
That's a 5,593 % increase over the current price. sufficient to convert $500 into $28,468 and $1,000 into $56,936. 
Those kinds of gains would take approximately 47 years in the stock market.
Celo enables us to invest in infrastructure that will improve the world's unbanked financial services. As a result, the buy-up-to price to $12 

Action to Take: Buy Celo (CELO).

Stop Loss: None

Sent CGLD to ETH address. Need help with derivation path,celo,oxnwtz,2021-08-04 04:04:31,3,0.81,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/celo/comments/oxnwtz/sent_cgld_to_eth_address_need_help_with/,zouzzz,,"Hi everyone - first time posting and would appreciate some help recovering my CGLD coins that I sent to my ETH address. I've gone through all the steps for recovery using Celo CLI and Celowallet.app (links at the end). I am very close using the Celo CLI method because I can see a CGLD balance when I check the ETH public address balance so the coins exist in my wallet. 

However, in order to send the coins out of my ETH wallet, I need to create a Celo account using the ETH wallet address and then send them to a proper Celo wallet. In order to create a Celo account, I need the derivation path which is correlated to my ETH public address. I used iancoleman.up (great tool) to find the derivation path for my specific address and as expected, my address was using a very common derivation path.

When I input the supposed derivation path which correlates to my public address, Celo CLI outputs another address entirely. The balance of the created wallet is zero, which proves the wrong derivation path.

Is there a way to create the Celo account in Celo CLI using the wallet address or another way I should be using to find the derivation path?

Here are the links to the methods I am using for reference:

https://alansav.wordpress.com/2020/12/06/recovering-celo-from-an-ethereum-address/amp/

https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/eth-recovery

TLDR: Sent CGLD to my ETH address and now I am trying to recover. Need derivation path correlated to my ETH wallet in order to send out the coins."

Can you also let me know which wallets support Celo (CGLD)? I have checked the ones you display on your website Mycrypto and Myetherwallet but these dont display any celo compatibility or at least I cant find the Celo network within the options.

***\*\*TO REDEEM IN USD from Coinbase\*\****

Sign in at [https://pro.coinbase.com/](https://pro.coinbase.com/) with your Coinbase account details.

1. Go to 'My Wallets' (top right corner near your user box)
2. Click on the 'Deposit' banner in the big Deposit & Withdrawal box on the left side.
3. Pick XLM etc, whichever you want to deposit.
4. Click on 'Coinbase Account' (option on the right side of the white box)
5. Click on 'Max' and Deposit it.
6. Now go to 'Trade' (One of the top menus)
7. Pick  BTC if you want to trade your XLM for USD, (FIRST you have to exchange  your XLM to BTC, then your BTC to USD. ) After picking BTC, click on  XLM-BTC, then 'Sell' and 'Max'. After that, click USD then BTC-USD,  click 'Buy' and 'Max'. These exchanges are instantaneous.
8. Go to 'My Wallets' again, click Withdraw, to Coinbase account and click max.

Now go back to [www.coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/)  Your GBP should've arrived, and now you are able to click 'Withdraw'. I  withdrew via Paypal, as Bank account transfers cost you $1. (Every  penny counts, right?!). These options will come up when you click  'Withdraw' from your USD wallet in Coinbase."

I am also not seeing any rewards happening although it has just been 29 hours since \*I thought\* I had activated it - should it show activated = 10?

I was trying to send them to another address of mine on coinlist.co, but the mobile app showed me an error during the process and no transaction hash and no confirmation were generated. The transaction is not shown anywhere and the recipient address never got the funds. The funds still show in my wallet chart but not in the wallet balance. I've tried to explain the situation for a week to coinbase support, which has not responded nor has been able to help me. My funds are still locked. I also filed a complaint. Is there any other way to prosecute this company which is locking my funds for no reason? 



Thanks

**Initiative Q**  
Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

Crypto IRA - AltoIRA,CryptoCurrency,lxa3hv,2021-03-03 21:06:07,16,1.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lxa3hv/crypto_ira_altoira/,cartoonfanboy,TRADING,"I have often wondered if a proper crypto IRA existed with sensible fees.  

I know I can Invest in BTC and ETH through some Index funds but that’s at a premium and I don’t own any of the underlying assets.  I can do this via bitwise or grayscale index funds.  

However I have finally found a company with sensible fees that offers me a proper crypto IRA where I own the underlying assets and they are held with a company I trust (coinbase).  

There are a number of companies offering Crypto IRA with a large monthly or yearly fee, and the crypto is held with a company I have never heard of.  For me this is a concern as I don’t know if they will be around when I retire. 

Coinbase is one of the most trusted if not the most trusted company when it comes to crypto, so I know for sure my assets are in a good place. 

You are not limited to BTC or ETH you can buy and sell any assets coinbase supports which whilst doesn’t include a lot I would like to invest it’s a lot more than other companies offer. 

The this crypto IRA works is that the digital assets are owned by the IRA account (kept at Coinbase) and you are the custodian of the IRA.  You can trade crypto (buy /sell) yet take the tax advantages that an IRA gives you.   Whilst you can withdraw to USD it will be the same as a normal IRA withdrawals where taxes may apply, limitations apply. 

 http://www.altoira.com is the company they are US based and this is a proper Roth IRA not needing an LLC as some crypto IRA’s do.  There support is excellent friendly, responsive and helpful which is actually what I need from a company l am using for my retirement. 

In order to buy and sell crypto they use Coinbase’s API.  Any cash held in your account is also coinbase account. 

You do not get a login to coinbase all trades are done via http://www.altoira.com website. 

There are no account opening or setup fees. Alto charges a 1.5% trade fee, which includes all exchange fees, and a fee to have an account, which is $2-$25/month based on the size of the account, and caps out at $25/month for accounts that are over $30,000. The account fee covers insurance and cold storage, as well as the annual IRS reporting for the IRA.

I look at a crypto IRA as an addition to my other retirement accounts just taxed advantaged. 

Just remember crypto is a very volatile market and the above is not financial advice.  

Below is the list of crypto that can be traded in your crypto IRA with AltoIRA crypto.

Where does the value of CELO-Gold come from?  


It says: as more people will use cUSD/Valora, the value of cGLD will increas, but why?   


I get that the reserve is a mix of cGold, other cryptocurrencies, and potentially even tokenized nature.   


But this still doesnt explain to me where the value of CGLD comes from. I mean i get it, its an awesome project with great values and great mission. But where does the value in cGLD lie?

Here are a few low effort airdrops to get you an extra $80+ in crypto for free.,CryptoCurrency,ls4mm7,2021-02-25 06:36:12,309,0.96,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ls4mm7/here_are_a_few_low_effort_airdrops_to_get_you_an/,HandsomeDarrell,GENERAL-NEWS,"First off, for everyone who doesn't know, an airdrop is a type of promotion where you get free crypto as a reward. Think of it as a promotion where you get paid to often learn about or join a community.

I've put a few low effort ones down here that I've personally used and can vouch for.

&#x200B;

**Coinbase:**

Most of you have probably heard of this one, Coinbase has a series of airdrops where you can watch a video and answer a few questions to get a few dollars worth of crypto everytime. The ones that are active at the time of writing are:

&#x200B;

* $3 - NuCypher (NU)
* $3 - TheGraph (GRT)
* $6 - Celo (CGLD)
* $19 - Compound (COMP)
* $10 - Stellar Lumens (XLM)

That's **$41** dollars in crypto for free. All you have to do is sign up for an account, complete KYC verification and join the wait list and wait for your invite to complete these. NO DEPOSIT NEEDED.

&#x200B;

**Coinmarketcap earn:**

This one is very similar to coinbase, but you'll also need a Binance account. Create both a Coinmarketcap account and a Binance account. Make sure to complete KYC verification on your Binance account. Next go to [https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/) and complete the quizzes to earn crypto. There's no waitlist here, just know that tokens are distributed at the end of the period (March 1st).

You'll need a Binance account since the crypto will be airdropped into your Binance wallet. If you need help with the quizzes, the answers are readily available on Google. Some have extra requirements though, but it is all explained on their respective pages. Current airdrops are:

&#x200B;

* $10 - Nervos Network (CKB)
* $10 - 1inch (1INCH)
* $10 - TheGraph (GRT)
* $10 - The Sandbox (SAND)

This **$40** is an estimate based on what I've earned in the past and what's available in information right now. End result may vary (but not by alot). 

&#x200B;

**Airdropbob:**

Airdropbob is a website that puts together a list of all the different kind of airdrops. Some are low effort, some are not. I highly suggest you check them out at [https://www.airdropbob.com/](https://www.airdropbob.com/) and see what they offer for yourselves!

NANO vs. CELO (CGLD) or other competitors,nanocurrency,lrepqx,2021-02-24 09:54:31,1,0.57,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/lrepqx/nano_vs_celo_cgld_or_other_competitors/,bullockwo,,"I have been holding some NANO since it was XRB, but to be honest haven't really followed crypto since 2018.  

Coinbase has a video learning promotion for CELO (CGLD) that I just watched which seems like a good project utilizing cell phone numbers for sending and receiving stable coins.

Since it's been a while since I've done any research, I'm interested to know what people feel are competitors to NANO.  Is CELO one of them? Is it possible for NANO to eventually be used on the CELO network for sending through phone numbers?  Are there other projects that people are keeping an eye on as potential competitors?

Disclosure, I have NANO, and don't have CELO (other than free promotion)."
"CELO/CGLD as an asset, why and how its a viable investment opportunity",celo,lr1b37,2021-02-23 21:32:53,10,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/celo/comments/lr1b37/celocgld_as_an_asset_why_and_how_its_a_viable/,whatisqueso,,"herrooo

I've been researching CELO the past week and am still confused as to how CELO as an asset could increase in value as more adoption and usage for the platform and application increases.

I'm looking to invest into CELO but I still can't understand how the price would rise and how viable of an investment opportunity it is. Ethereum increases as there's more demand and utility within their ecosystem since gas is what's needed to fuel the system. Does something similar work for CELO? Tbh, the whole stablecoin throws me off and I'm not sure if there's a huge opportunity for growth. 

So far, I understand CELO is used as an asset to modulate the supply of cUSD to meet the varying demands of the crypto. I just can't make the connection of how CELO could possible be worth $50-$500 in the future or if that's even a possibility with the structure setup. 

Any insight would be much appreciated!"
Re: Charles' Rant about Giveaway Scams - He's Wrong and I'll Tell You Why He's Wrong,cardano,lo6fri,2021-02-20 07:46:02,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lo6fri/re_charles_rant_about_giveaway_scams_hes_wrong/,wilbur111,Media,"Bear in mind that I'm absolutely not the kind of person who'd fall for a giveaway scam - but I accept there are people in the world who think with ""a different kind of good sense"" to me.

Charles vents angrily for 11 minutes that ""we'll never give away free ada"" and ""you don't get something for nothing"" and to ""use your fucking brain"" and so on.

The thing is, that's not particularly true or fair.

Here are some coins that just appeared in my Binance account.  I did nothing \*at all\* to get them  ""All I had to do"" was own crypto.:

* Bitcoin Cash (BCH), BitTorent (BTT), Just (JST), Wink (WIN).
* Value: $500

I also have coins from Coinbase LEarn and ""all I had to do"" was watch a couple of videos and click a few buttons:

* Stellar (XLM), Compound (COMP), Maker (MKR),, EOS, (EOS), Graph, (GRT), Celo, (CGLD), NuCypher (NU)
* Value: $200

I owned Ripple in December so ""all I had to do"" to get free coins from that was login to my wallet and click a few buttons (I did this literally minutes before watching Charles' rant)

* Flare (FLR)
* Value: not yet known

I didn't get the Uniswap airdrop but ""all you had to do"" was have used Uniswap at some point:

* 400 Uniswap (UNI)
* Value: $10,800

I even got free testnet ADA and ""all I had to do"" was own some on a certain date and... click a few buttons.

Indeed, many people even got free ETC/ETH...

&#x200B;

So what's the difference with these Giveaway Scams?

* Well the main difference is that I'd have to \*prove\* that I own some ada.  I don't just get to sit there, have someone figure out that I do, and let the dough come rolling in.
* The second is that I actually have to distinguish myself from the crowd.  It's not free money for everyone, it's free money for those who take part.
* Thirdly, it involves actual work and stress.
* Fourth(ly), there's the apparently real video of Charles himself saying live that it's real.  (Versus you someone secretly dropping 400 UNI in your account.)

Let me elaborate on the third.  Sending Ada to my own wallet is terrifying enough.  Sending Ada to a friend's is even more terrifying.  I've been properly in crypto for 5 or 6 years and I still send ""test amounts"" to make sure I've got the address right.  Sending Ada to ""Charles' account"" is waaay more work-like, stressful and less ""free"" than ""simply owning ada during a snapshot"" or clicking a few buttons to delegate.

&#x200B;

All crypto of all kinds is viewed as a scam to most people.  I can't even convince my friends I get 5% APY on my Ada even without the market gains.  They insist \*that's\* a scam.

Try telling someone outside crypto (or even some of you guys) that you can get 18% APY on stablecoins on Celsius; they'll want to sit you down and explain kindly and clearly that it's ""obviously a scam"", that it's ""not possible"" and ""why would they do that when they don't have to?"".  They'd even give the cautionary advice, ""you don't get something for nothing in this world"". 

I get \*exactly\* that whenever I suggest friends convert fiat to stablecoin and stick it in Celsius.

And yet Charles is working on a deal with Alex to get Ada on Celsius.  At what yield?  10%?  12%?  Whatever it is, my friends will think it's a ""clearly a scam"".

&#x200B;

Charles is a billionaire.  I know he got into bitcoin ""for the right reasons"" but at the time he was mining bitcoin, I opted instead to ""mine"" the SETI project instead (to search for alien life in the radio waves from space).  I also did it ""for the right reasons""... and that didn't make me a billionaire.

Crypto is different.

To a lot of people, Charles got his bitcoin billions for free.  And so they simply dream of getting a few thousand for free in what appears to them to be a similar way.

Further, Charles was already a billionaire 2 months ago.  So he now has 8-10 times as many billions as he had two months ago.  How many does he have now?  $10bn?  $20bn?  More?

So, as my very generous girlfriend pointed out, ""Why's it so weird to think a billionaire who got his billions for free would give away a tiny, tiny part of the many billions of dollars he's gained just since Christmas (for free) in what would appear to be a marketing campaign that would help him make even more billions... for free?""

Roger Ver has been giving away free Bitcoin (and then Bitcoin Cash) for yeaaaars.

(And I must say, it can be quite jarring to hear a multi-bazllionaire saying angrily, ""I will never give away free Ada.  I will never give away free Ada.  I will never give away free Ada"".  I know what he means, but it's not the best way to say it.)

&#x200B;

In Summary:

People \*are\* thinking, people \*are\* using their brains, people \*are\* making decisions that seem to them to be rational and well thought through.

Although I understand Charles' perspective, and although I also instantly see them as scams, who does it help to pretend that any free crypto ever is a scam scam scam and only an absolute fool would think otherwise ... when it's clearly not the case.

You \*can\* get crypto for free.  People have got rich for free in crypto.

To Charles, $10k in free UNI may not be ""rich,"" but to many it's absolutely, 100% life-changing.  It's totally reasonable for people to find it hard to differentiate between free Ada giveaways and free Uniswap Giveaways... I mean free Uniswap ""airdrops"".

&#x200B;

Charles' intention is good.  I think his method and empathy needs some tinkering.  Without those adjustments, I don't think an effective solution can be found.

(And I still think Charles is grrrreat.)
