"[REVIEW] Lacoste polo-sweater, 1/3 zipper sweater & high neck tee",MulebuyFans,1i9wyn3,2025-01-25 16:02:18,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wyn3,Moist_Demand1052,📃Review📃,"I'll first talk about my favorite, the brown jersey-pole. In my opinion it is a great piece, very versatile, you can wear it either with jeans or with more formal pants, I wear it with nothing underneath and with a feather jacket and I like it, the interior material is comfortable, on the outside it is like a pole but very thick.

The jerseys with a 1/3 zipper, I saw in some Reddit publications that spoke highly of them, they have an old money style that I really like, if I'm honest I can't say anything bad about this garment, but I would like that if you see something wrong tell me, I am dressing it with total confidence and if there is something wrong I would not like that.

The high neck shirt is a little more special, in the aspect that the fit is a little strange in my opinion, I would think that I would stay a little tighter, maybe you like it but I am not wearing it much, maybe it's my body or my perspective. The fabric is fine, it looks like pure cotton.
Everything is TTS, size L, except the green 1/3 zipper, wich is XL.

I have sent everything with Mulebuy together with the other part of my Haul that I published previously, it was a 7kg package and I paid for the shipment 135 USD with free insurance, I think it is the shipment that has arrived the fastest so for the moment everything well with Mulebuy.

It’s me again! Now with an updated thought exercise! Improved Domestic and diplomatic stuff. So enjoy!  
  
Queue the second term fanfiction! Since I’ve finished my Sordland AAR (link above) I wanted to make/create/envision a second term. Or headcanon, whatever you want to call it. But this is not an epilogue (yet), rather a list of ideas, plans and thought exercises of what would happen in a socialist Rayne’s second term. And if Suzerain wasn’t such a pain in the ass to mod I would try to make one. But alas.  
  
  
PS. If The pictures are fucky tell me I'll repost with it fixed.

**Main term mechanics/problems**

·       Coalition/cabinet stability/support

Now that Rayne has won a second term and the PSP has a plurality, he will be forced to form the first coalition government in Sordlands history. But with whom?

https://preview.redd.it/lmepfj4k46fe1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0985813a05a7ff7307c68f8b35c6bcd203e81382

So, from left to right: PSP, USP, NFP, PFJP, CPS, WPB and BFP  
So what are the options for a coalition?

\-The centrist way: a coalition with the PFJP. Coalition negotiations will require a lot of compromise on your socialist agenda but *should* not anger the more reactionary elements of the country, like the military. This will ofcourse include appeasing Ricter and keeping him happy. We don’t want a fallen government right? And not to mention you just *barely* have a majority in the GNA.  
I’ll call this coalition “the purple coalition” after blue+red=purple.  
**Coalition stability: middling + reactionary threat: low**

\-The revolutionary way:  a coalition with the CPS and the WBP should not be very difficult and you could go all out with your agenda. You also have a comfortable majority, that plus working with very like-minded parties government stability will not be a problem. Just make sure that you give Stahler and Leke a position in your cabinet.  
But for the rest of the political spectrum this would be an attack on the very spirit of Sordland itself, *according tot hem anyway.* So expect major problems with the USP and NFP.  
I’ll call this “the scarlet coalition” because scarlet sounds better than red.  
**Coalition stability: high + reactionary threat: high**

**-** The ‘destined to fail’ way: a coalition with the PFJP and the CPS/WPB. Why would you do this? Your agenda will be impossible to satisfy both sides who will be constantly bickering about everything. Atleast you have a good majority in the GNA, but don’t take their loyalty for granted. And on top of a wonky coalition, conservatives wil not be happy about the CPS/WPB in government.  
I’ll call this “the Red bird coalition” after the PFJP’s bird.  
**Coalition stability: low + reactionary threat: middling**

 

\-So Anton has formed a coalition, but what next? Maintaining that coalition ofcourse. Basicly if Anton diverts to much or doesn’t keep his promises from the coalition negotiations (like being too planned econ with the PFJP) the government falls wich means you now have a minority government, a few empty cabinet spots and have lost the trust of the people.

 

·       Reactionary influence/terrorists

\-Sordlands transition to socialism will not be warmly received by large parts of the country. Like the USP/NFP and the military. Ofcourse reactionary resistance will be higher or lower depending on the coalition you chose to form.

\-The USP and the NFP will form the “United Sordish Front” even if you chose the centrist coalition. If you are extra mean to the PFJP and disrespect them enough they will join the USF, enlarging the opposition but destabilising it.

\-Now the USF is a mix of free-market capitalists and moderate reformists (Ricterists), Sollists (Lileasists) and Sordist nationalists (Kibenerists). They will do everything to undermine you and make you fail. Because in their eyes you are destroying Sordland.  
Now you can try to undermine *them*, sowing distrust amongst the wings, negotiating with one wing instead of the whole USF as example. Fabricating scandals etc.

\-But outside the GNA the Young Sords are still running around and *they will not be happy.*  
So why not make another terrorist group? The “Saviors of Sordland” has a good ring to it no? Active in Agnolia and parts of Gruni. The most ignored region and the most reactionary region respectively. Again the strenght of the SS will depend how radical your government is, but you can still expect asassinations and bombings.

3 options of resistance that depends on the coalition you picked:  
\- Agnland resistance: low, Gruni resistance: almost nonexisting  
\-AR: high, GR: middling  
\-AR: middling, GR: low

·       Military loyalty

Our beloved general Egg (Iosef) and the rest of the military won’t be to happy with socialist Rayne so they need to be dealt with. Now military loyalty will be naturally low at the start, the coalition you pick will only improve loyalty a little bit or decrease it a lot.

\-How do ensure their loyalty? Well we can try throwing money at the military to keep them happy but that will not work forever…

\-We can slowly remove anti-socialist elements/figures under the guise of ‘doctrine changes’. But be carefull! The military is not that stupid.

\-You can ‘reassure’ the military by letting Iosef staying as defense ministry. But he will be a pain in the ass. So manage him carefully.

\-If the military is disloyal enough they might do something ‘rash’. Like supporting the reactionary SS and maybe even a coup. If you aren’t carefull enough.

·         Economic stability

Sordland finds itself in a new era of prosperity. But that can’t be the case forever.  
If you make questionable economic decisions, mismanage the planned economy, if there is to much unrest economic stability will decrease. Affecting future economic projects, the Sordish budget and the welfare of the nation.

\-If Economic stability drops to much the Sordish economy will stagnate and Rayne will lose considerable support.

\-How do we prevent this? Good question I don’t really know but probably by managing the budget correctly, allocating resources correctly and staying focused on economic goals (not flip-flopping to one thing and another).

·       Diplomatic activeness

Sordland is now part of the CSP and posseses the largest ATO-CSP border in the world (as far as we know). Sordland has the power to become a formidable regional power, I think Sordish diplomatic power can stretch from Rumburg to Nibiya, from Morella to Agard. This presents a couple of problems and opportunities, like courting Morella to join the CSP, undermining Arcasian interests in central and southern Merkopa (Qinal and Agard) and some ‘nation building’ in Rika. And don’t forget the growing tensions with Lespia and Agnolia.  
 Sordland has a few choices in the diplomatic arena, let’s go over them.

\-The sword of the CSP.  
Sordland makes strides to spread the revolution across the world!  
extensivily aiding(and influencing) Morella, Wehlen and Rikan nations to get them to join the CSP. Harrasing Lespia, Agnolia, Qinal and The Free Cities. And generally be a pain in the ass for ATO, and sometimes for United Contanta.

\-The lance of the CSP.  
Sordland will take the middle road and not upset the fragile balance *too* much. Still trying to expand the influence of the CSP and some mediating on the side. Also no harrasing nations.

\-The shield of the CSP.  
Sordland will avoid angering ATO and upsetting the balance in Merkopa and will be focused on strenghtening bonds with fellow CSP nations. And only partake in low risk diplomatic plans, international investment and aid. Sordland will also try to be a mediating force to prevent hostilities.

 

 

**Economic decisions, plans and opportunities**

Aright now that we have the main problems/mechanics of Rayne’s second term let’s talk about the economics!

 

·       Economic direction.  
Now that Sordish economy operates under a planned economy the question is what to do with it? Was this the end goal or is it a stepping stone?

\-Maintain the full command economy: The least risky option, it worked so far right so why fix it? This decision will not have much effect, it’ll keep people happy, the military won’t suspect anything and the economy will run *fine*. As long as you don’t screw things up.  
\[economic stability decreases more with ‘bad choices’\] \[the military and the USF won’t be angry *as much*\]

\-Transition to a socialist market economy: Cut back state control/intervention while maintaining socialist principles and put the workers first. It will be a delicate balance but the  added flexibility should be worth it. Again it is your choice how far you go with this. Will you fuck it up and create a system were the oligarchs can rise once again? Will you achieve the perfect balance of opportunity and workplace democracy? Or something in between?  
\[Economic stability will decrease less with ‘bad choices’\]\[The military and the USF won’t be happy but the moderates might be surprised and warm up to you\]

\-The Valgslandian way: You’re truly the idealist aren’t you Rayne? If you do this the proletariat will love you for it, Emmerich Hegel will love you for it and LUS/the Trade Unions too. Workerplace democracy, strenghtening the unions, decentralisation. You will try to create a true socialist economy that is centered on the common worker. Increasing effiency and public opinion. But at the cost of angering the reactionaries beyond saving, if you don’t take drastic measures prepare for a *significant* uptick in SS activities an expect the USF and the military to openly defy you and engage with *illegal activities*.  
\[Economic stability isn’t effected\]\[The military and the USF will ‘declare war’ on you\]

Economic focuses  
When I started Suzerain I was a little dissapointed with the lack of economic decisions so why not make my own? Now we have Economic directions, focuses and projects. Economic focuses are wich industry/region you want to focus on. This is quite long term so you can only pick one focus, so choose well.

\-Petrochemical expansion: Sordland has oil, gas and a very big important port. Lachaven is perfect for a large petrochemical industry. Oil refineries, gas refineries and plastic based industries. All essential to a thriving modern economy. To accomplish this huge investments are needed in Lachaven, Narbel and Estord.  
Now for a visual demonstration.  
Quick legend: Green=most economic impact/yellow= medium economic impact/Red= a little economic impact.  
Now this focus will make Lachaven even more of an economic juggernaut, and ofcourse for a petrochemical industry you need oil and gas so Narbel and Estord will also receive economic stimulation. And don’t forget that Gelsord also benefits from a strong Lachaven. Sordland will export more refined oil and plastic products in than anyone on the Merkopan continent! Exept Rizia ofcourse.  
 \[This focus will have greater effect if you’ve invested in Gasom\]

\-Expansion of high-tech industries:  We all love the Gelsord silicon valley synergy, because it’s good. So why not expand it even more? Electronics, advanced shipbuilding, advanced steelmaking, pharmaceuticals etc. With this risky and ambitious plan you will propel Sordland to new heights! And make the Sordish coast truly out of petrol, silicon and high-quality steel! Ofcourse with such a big plan you need to chose on what part you will focus the most. On Morna and Morbel steelmaking and engine factories? Or on the radio factories and the labs in Gelsord? Or on general manufacturing in Greater Holsord? Gelsord and Greater Holsord will see new heights! Lorren will also heavily benefit, after all we all need steel and engines. And ofcourse some slight positives for Lachaven and Deyr. With this plan Sordland will become one of the most technological economies in the world! Exept the superpowers ofcourse.  
\[This focus will have greater effect if you’ve invested in electronic industries\]

\-Expansion of manufacturing/heavy industries: Become the workshop of the world. Why inovate if everything still works? Textiles, furniture, glass, and paper industries. A quite safe focus but should still be exremely beneficial. Primarely focused on the Greater Holsord and Lorren areas Gelsord and Lachaven should still get a boost. And expect export to explode. \[This focus has greater effect if you’ve done Conriat Industrial City\]

\-Expansion of agriculture and mineral extraction: And finally some love for Bergia and Gruni. Becoming the bread basket of Merkopa will be difficult but with enough shrewd investment it should be possibe. And mineral xports are always needed. Zinc, copper, silver, iron, coal and even uranium *perhaps*, are all minerals that nations pay high prices for. With this plan Gruni and Sarna will be cultivating crops wile Ribel and the south of Greater Holsord will be extracting the ground of out great nation!  
\[Investments in Gruni and Bergia will make this plan more succesfull\]

Economic projects  
These projects are like the L-1 and the Conriat industrial city projects. *Relatively* small in comparisons with the others. But with Sordlands economy back on track you can afford TWO projects at a time! Isn’t that amazing! These projects will have a synergy with economic focuses, other decisions and diplomatic stuffs.

\-Expansion of the L-1 railway to Morna, Conriat and Estord: Pretty self-explanitory, better rail connection equals happier citizens and economic growth. A pretty safe option and will help turn Sordlands coast into an economic powerhouse.

https://preview.redd.it/mjqrsi1w16fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=63398301c6db6f55461ee5158848a4cf7a033739

\-Expansion of L-1 railway to Deyr, Erzaren and Wizen: A plan to better connect Bergia tot he rest of Sordland. And a plan to increase connectivity with Wehlen, Smolak will love you for it but it will have diplomatic consequences, positive and negative.

https://preview.redd.it/uo4l212426fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4b6725f84d8e579af3e9c66cb835f4d5f6de823

\-Expansion of Agnland infrastructure: Finally! Somebody has not forgotten Agnland! With the revival of the H-3 project and the expansion of the L-1 railway to arvory Agnland will finally stop being a backwater! But this will not really help with the economy (except Agnland) but the people will be happy.

https://preview.redd.it/mtkqbhpe26fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=52c084863df4cc7f850f409a4bfea5b70305e09d

·       -Estord oil expansion: We will always need more oil so why not? And ofcourse this will work well with the petrochemical plan.

\-Gelsord inovation hub: Gelsord is already the most advanced city in Sordland, so why not take that to the next level? Also what’s with those ‘robots’ I keep hearing about?

\-Ribel mining expansion: The mountains around Ribel are filled with metals and minerals, if we can expand the operations there it wouldy surely benefit us.

\-Morbel industry modernization program: upgrading those metallurgy plants and heavy transport factories will make Morbel once again the king of steel and smog in Lorren!

PS. I wanted to include a ‘make a nuclear powerplant’ project but I think that’s a little far fetched, for now.        

**Military**

 

 

It’s the military’s turn! So what’s on the agenda? Well, doctrine changes, budget changes, managing Iosef and a few more things.  
  
  


·       Doctrine changes  
Well it’s time for a few changes in the military! War always changes so Sordland needs to get with the times. But how will Rayne achieve that? And will Rayne use this as an excuse to purge the military?  
PS. I’ve just read a comment from u/jistiesep about Sordland’s miliary so I’m going to take a few things from that so thank you u/jistiesep! Also here is their comment:  
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
\-The army: The doctrine of the Sordish army is severly outdated, relying on infantry assault and is full of officers like Valken. Time to change this, but how?  
  
Option 1: Do nothing, keep the old doctrine, ofcourse this will be detrimental for any future engangements but maybe you didn’t want to risk anything  
  
Option 2: Switch to ‘combined arms warfare’/more ‘modern’ doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I’m not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Iosef alligned-*mostly* moderate officers.  
\[Iosef will be happy and trust you more, military loyalty doesn’t change, the military is more *United*\]  
  
Option 3: Switch to ‘combined arms warfare’/more ‘modern’ doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I’m not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Socialist and regime-friendly officers  
\[Iosef will not be happy, military loyalty will increase, the military grows further *divided*\]  
  
Now this repeats for the air force and the navy, but what does the ‘Iosef happy meter’, ‘military loyalty’ and ‘military unity’ mean?  
  
\-Iosef happy meter: pretty simple, if Iosef isn’t happy he will start working against you. So be nice to him, prioritise funding for his projects and give him more influence. But that can be a two bladed sword, if you give him to much influence and *then anger him* he will turn the entire military against you. And if that happens you’re fucked  
  
On the other hand if you manage things right you can deprive him of allies and isolate the Egg, without him even knowing it.  
  
\-Military loyalty: a little less simple, still basicly represents how well the military listens to you, if it is to low they will refuse to take your orders, be more likely to help your militant opposition and will coup you if they can find an authority figure to rally behind.  
  
Now how do increase loyalty? By getting socialist officers into the military ofcourse! You can try to isolate high command by replacing the lower-ranking officer corp or try to a ‘quick purge’ of high command under the guise of doctrine changes. Both of these have ther up- and downsides.  
  
\-Military unity: When you are trying to make the military more friendly to you by appointing socialist officers and other things you are also dividing the military politically, opening the way for infighting. This ofcourse comes with it’s own myriad of problems.  
  


·       Military procurement  
  
Every military needs more weapons, *new* weapons too. New armored vehicles, jet aircraft, assault rifles, missiles, helicopters, boats etc. Ofcourse there are a few things that can influence these decisions, like budget, different schools of thought and industrial/intellectual capabality.  
  
\-Budget: Pretty simple, how much will you spend on projects and the military as a whole? Granting bigger budgets will make the military happy and give better results. But if you’re too liberal with funding they may get careless and wastefull. And ofcourse you can veto the projects but that will not make the military happy.  
  
\-Different opinions: One guy thinks the new jet should prioritise guns and minimise it’s turnrate while the other guy wants to focus on the range and those new heat-seeking missiles. These ‘guys’ have their alignment and loyalties, choosing/supporting one guy over the other strengthens ‘that guy’s’ position in the military thus increasing or decreasing Iosef’s/Old-Guard/Socialist influence.  
  
\- Industrial/intellectual capabality: Sordland is not a superpower, it still needs to buy a lot of it’s own military hardware and licenses. So it’s delusional to think that Sordland can completely design, test and produce it’s own military equipment. So you need to decide how much help you import from outside. If you import to much the military will be displeased and you will be more reliant on the CSP. On the other hand if you try to do everything on your own could compromise the quality of the equipment.  
  
  


·       Military wages and pensions  
  
Here is were the comment of u/ Domitien comes in, it boils down to the point that probably most of the military budget is used for huge military pensions and wages for officers from the Soll era. seems like an easy way to cut expenses, all those old officers and vets are almost dead anyway. But this WILL make the military angry.  
  


  
  
**Domestic stuff**

Alright, this part is about education, healtcare, dealing with the reactionary resistance, the Bludish and a few other things. So let’s start.

 

·       Welfare state  
  
You can’t be socialist without a welfare state righ?  
Welfare state’s are popular yes but they do cost a lot so what will you do?  
  
\-Just expand on the existing structure: Nothing special, better pensions, housing assistence, unemployment subsidies etc. still quit popular and won’t cost as much.  
  
\-enlarge the welfare state substantially: Make school (almost) entirely free, implement a system that increases wages if inflation increases (Belgium style). And more.  
  
\-Make UBI a reality: Try to give everyone a garanteed wage, ofcourse you can implement in different ways. Maybe link it to the rent of an appartment, the proce of groceries or go all out so that ‘in principle’ no Sordish man needs to work anymore. But this will have consequences.  
  


·       Healtcare  
  
\-Do you invest more into healtcare? Do you choose between removing the last differences between rural and urban hospitals? Or do you focus on advancing medical technology in the cities, leaving the countyside in the dust?  
  


·       Education  
  
\-More money for Ms Walda? Do you focus on school accessibility to destroy illiteracy or do you focus on the sciences and the universities to make Sords the smartest people in Merkopa? Again do you focus on the countryside or the cities.  
  


·       The Bludish  
  
\-Who can forget about the Bludish? I don’t really have an ideas about this but I guess you can focus on deradicalising the Bludish population with subsidies and stimilus packages. And officially/publically condem the Izzam incident.  
  
  


·       Public transport  
  
very expensive project but will also make you very popular  
  
\-Light rail expansion: connect a lot of small rural towns across Sordland to the rail network. Rural population will like this.  
  
\-Metro and tram expansion: Make big cities better and more prepared for bigger populations. Urban population will like this.  
  
\-Construct a bus fleet: I don’t know if Sordland has buses but it has them now! Connect rural towns and big cities alike. Everyone likes this a little bit.  
  
  


·       Land redistribution  
  
\-One of the central socialist policies, take land from big landowners and give it to the common farmer. Pretty simple concept. Again you decide how far you go with this. But in short small farmers like you more and the landowners don’t.  
  
  


·       Reactionary resistance  
  
\-You’re a socialist president in a socialist government in a socialist superpower bloc. People aren’t stupid, they will fight against you. The core reactionaries of the Saviours of Sordland (SS) recruit from people who are dissatisfied with your ideas and policies. People in Agnland who feel forgotten. Conservative rural people who think you’re an urban elite, Military veterans etc.  
Now it’s your job to deal with them.  
  
\-Option one: Use the military to crush the SS. Sounds straight forwrd but isn’t. I think the SAF isn’t that good in fighting guerilla warfare (evident by their inability to destroy the BFF) So it might be too difficult. So if you fail again and again the political opposition might see an opportunity.  
  
\-Option 2: Try to destroy their base. Can’t locate SS cells in Arvory because nobody gives any information because they dislike the government? Make sure you appear concerned with their problems and make sure they have food on the table with a stable job.  
  
Now you also have the Red Youth to use. These determined socialist will do about everything you ask, wether you want it or not. They can be very usefull in fighting the SS and the Young Sords but using them to much discredits your government and make you appear tyrannical. If you use them to often and give them to much resources while you aren’t socialist enough they might attempt something rash, and maybe United Contana is looking for a new arrangement too…  


·       Endgame  
  
Now this is something that just came to mind. At the end of Rayne’s second term when you have solidified socialist control over the military, significantly decreased reactionary power and created a succesfull socialist economy. You should be able to finally declare the ‘People’s Socialist Democratic Republic of Sordland’ or maybe you want to drop a few adjectives  and just have the ‘Socialist Republic of Sordland’.  


**Diplomacy**  
  
  


Who doesn’t love diplomacy? Sordland has a lot of opportunities on the world stage. Let’s go over a few.  
  
the main focus (acording to me) would be to enlarge the CSP, Morrella and Wehlen. Creating problems for ATO, infiltrating/isolating Lespia. And while doing those things maybe gain some military, economical benefits?  


·       Wehlen  
  
The funny man’s domain, Wehlen is a pseudo-socialist genocidal state that conveniently is anti-west and thus likes us. So why not use it to further the CSP’s and our interests?  
  
\-Give him money: just give him money, promise him investments to increase Wehlen’s wealth. You can also promise Smolak a new fancy mansion.  
  
\-Give him guns: give him weapons pretty simple.  
  
But why do this? To get Wehlen into the CSP and isolate Lespia and exert pressure on ATO in central Merkopa ofcourse.  
  
But president Smolak can be a wild card, so maybe you are planning to remove him from the picture and replace him with someone less controversial, and more loyal…  


·       Morella  
  
Morella would be the first South Merkopan nation to join the CSP and they’re actively trying to join so with an injection of a few billion Sordish Ren and military equipment they should have no problem joining the revolution!  
  
Now here is where the infiltration comes in. If you are really want to spread the revolutions you can *try* to infiltrate theses nations and fund Malyenevist groups.  
  
But don’t take it too far! You’re shenanigans can be uncovered and even United Contana will tell you too stop if you take it to far.

·       Rumburg  
  
Honestly I don’t think Rumburg will be that much of a pain the ass. They can’t really use the BFF because you gave the Bludish rights. They can’t bully you because you’re in the CSP.  
  
But that doesn’t mean YOU can’t be a pain in the ass for THEM.  
How does it feel Beatrice when foreign powers arm terrorists who want to overthrow the government? HOW DOES IT FEEL?!!  
  
Again with enough *discreet* support you can tie down the Rumburg army and government in a guerilla war in their own country, with their own people. And we know what guerilla wars do to nations.  
  


·       Agard  
  
The ATO’s very own drug-trafficing hub. Now there is a very big opportunity here to spread the revolution. Nobody in their right mind WANTS to live in a damn mafia-state so resistance movements should be plentifull.  
Now there should be few opportunities/choices for you to interfere.  
(All resistance/group names are product of my own fantasy/insanity, non are canon)  
  
\-Support the Aegardian Democrats: Centrist democratic opposition, pretty mild in their anti-establishment actions. They prefer to keep things legal in a country where laws don’t mean anything, so hopelesly naive. If you fund them enough they might be able to exercise enough power to soft-coup the narco-lord Severo Rios(head of government), leading to them cracking down on the drug trade but they will keep the ATO observer status unless you place some strings in their government.  
  
\-Support the Magka Group: A rival drug cartel that would like Rios’ head on a stick. Not the nicest but an easy option to support, they’re violent and ready to shoot up Rios’ palace. Now if you fund them enough they can replace Severo Rios’ leading to no change or even an increase in the drug trade but if you promise the new head guy a nice mansion and enough gold toilets he will rescind that ATO observer status for you.  
  
\-Support the Fruma Guerilla’s: The hardcore Malenyevist group in Agard. With their influence concentrated around the central lake they have the advantage that they can evade government attacks quite easily. Now their military power has decreased in recent years but if manage to pump enough guns and money into them they will gladly march to Ardeal and burn the drug lords tot he ground. But beware, ATO WILL notice that a waning guerilla army has just out of nothing gained traction again. So thread carefully.  
  


·       The Free Cities  
  
A Dastnurity confederacy that’s buddies with Arcasia and also rich with tourist money. Now I imagine TFC is quite a stable country so no revolution possible. But you can pull some strings.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Jathlas’ Federalists: An upcoming movement that calls for more integration and for an even closer relationship with ATO. Now you can plant some agents, create corruption scandals, leak those scandals. If you’re succesfull you can kill the movement before it can seize control.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Confederate Dastnuritists: The embodiment of the status quo in TFC. still this presents an opportunity, if you empower them enough you can a political deadlock between them and the Federalists. And you can also pull a few strings, maybe prevent that third ATO base in the south?  
  
\-Support the Golcondist insurgents: Pro Derdian Golcondists who want to reach Golconda by making life hell for TFC. So why not help them? If you’re succesfull enough they will tie down quite a bit of ATO resources, for a few years at least.  
  


·       Qinal  
  
Aaah… ATO’s main partner in Xina, and one that openly defied Arcasia in the past. They are on good terms right now but maybe we can dig up those tensions somehow?  
  
\-Support the Qinali Liberal Party: Contrary tot heir name the QLP are on the right part of the Qinali political spectrum, the *far* right. They champion Qinaly exceptionalism, independence from foreign influence and economic statism. At this point they are a small faction in parlement but a loud one. With some extra funds they will do better but if you manage to dig up/fabricate another PMC scandal the QLP will surge in popularity, and with those elections coming up…  
  
\-Support the Qinali Unbowed Party: A new small extraparlementary party trying to present a left alternative to the ruling coalition. Now they aren’t Malenyevist or even socialist but they are friendlier and more open to other ‘vieuwpoints’. Now if you manage to get them into parlement they *maybe* can get in a coalition as a minor partner. Perhaps not that effective at fighting ATO’s influence but it’s a nice foundation to build upon.  
  
  


·       Lespia  
  
Lespia, who doesn’t hate that drunk son of a bitch Alvarez? I imagine two ways you can go about dealing with them.  
  
\-The agressive way: Start by sending agents into Lespian cities and the country side, identify people and groups who are willing to ‘cooperate’ and ‘present an alternative’ to the status quo. Arm them, drill them. Spy on the government and the military.  
And when the Lespian status quo starts to fall and Alvarez’ control starts to slip, use them to burn the bourgois to the ground.  
  
\-The diplomatic way: The world is one misfire from a Sordish/Lespian rifle away from nuclear hellfire. So inflating tensions might not bet he best idea. So organize a few diplomatic visits, maybe sign some token demiliterization agreements. So when that spark inevitable sets Perla on fire the Lespian government trusts you and are willing to cooperate more.  
  
Apart from that you can park a naval fleet *just* outside their territorial waters or fly an airplane in to their airspace. Basicly intimidation attemps and being a real asshole for ATO. But this does not come without consequences, a lot of nations will see you raising tensions needlessly and they won’t be happy.  
  
  
  


 

**Diplomatic crisis**

We all know that Sordland’s population is *weird*, really 37 million? Rizia has 40 million Lespia has 60 million for god’s sake. It just doesn’t make any sense. So I though up an in-universe explanation.  
  
Basicly the repression of the Sordish King, the instability of the first republic, the civil war and the Soll stagnation caused a shit ton of Sords to emigrate. Hence the low population. And here is the seed of a diplomatic crisis that will almost lead to war.  
  
Now that Sordland is in a better state president Rayne will seek to bring these people back to Sordland. So he basicly says to the world: “If you are a Sord In Lespia, Agnolia, Valgsland etc. Come back! We have a big stimulus, house and a job to give you!”. Now I estimate that around 2,5 million Sords live abroad, most of them in Lespia serving as cheap labor. So when these underpaid underappreciated (probably target of racism) hear that they can go back to their home country for a better life they will drop everything and go. But you know Lespians, they love their cheap labor! So they prevent them from leaving so the Sords protest the government wich leads to a riot wich leads to the police fireing on the Sordish protestors. Wich causes national outrage and within a week the streets of Perla and Falenco are on fire, major protests erupting across the country, The Sordish protestors are now joined by lower class Lespians who want an end to the inequality.  
  
Now it’s YOUR job to react to this. Your largest rival is on fire, activily murdering your people and their own too. So what do you do?  
  
\-Ramp up funding for revolutionary groups to destabilise Lespia even more, making Alvarez even more desperate, making him more likely to accept terms.  
  
\-Deploy the military to DEMAND that Lespia allow all Sords to safely leave the country, and if they don’t…  
  
\-Use diplomacy, try to get the rest of ATO and the AN to agree with you demands.  
  
Ofcourse you can use a combination of all of these to get your way. But if this little crisis last to long it will grow out of control. Lespia is teetering on the edge of a cliff so ATO is **desperate** to prevent a revolution. While this is happening both the SAF and the LAF (Lespian Armed Forces) are staring eachother down at the border, opening the possibility of ‘incidents’ that can escalate the crisis into a full blow war. And if that happens you’re in big trouble. Again you’re *one misfire* away from nuclear hellfire, don’t forget that.

  
  
  
  
**Conclusion**

 

Alright, now I would like to hear your critisisms on my medieval scroll-sized post.  
Eventually I will make an ‘official’ epilogue for Red Sunrise over Sordland.  
And know that I think about it I may just make an in-dept post about the Lespia crisis, and find a better name for it. I’m open to suggestions!

Why I Believe Saitama Reborn is Massively Undervalued,SaitamaInuERC20,1i9qma2,2025-01-25 11:26:11,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaitamaInuERC20/comments/1i9qma2/why_i_believe_saitama_reborn_is_massively/,Exotic-Midnight-6028,,"# My Journey in Crypto

I began trading cryptocurrency around mid-2023, diving headfirst into what has been an exhilarating yet often frustrating journey. Early on, I dedicated countless hours to research—reading whitepapers, analyzing roadmaps, and trying to make calculated decisions. While I managed a few small wins, my tendency to rotate into other projects too quickly often erased any gains I made.

Time and again, I would sell tokens for modest profits, only to watch them skyrocket after I exited. These missed opportunities taught me a hard lesson about the dangers of over-rotation and the importance of patience in investing.

After enduring several cycles of frustration, I pivoted towards meme coins. At first, I thought I’d found my niche, but even this sector wasn’t without its challenges. Rug pulls, exorbitant gas fees, and overtrading continued to hinder my progress. I knew I had to refine my approach if I wanted to succeed.

# The Unique Appeal of Meme Coins

Meme coins are unlike any other asset class in the crypto space. What started with Dogecoin as a joke has evolved into a phenomenon, driven by communities that rally around humor, shared beliefs, and a sense of belonging. These coins tap into a unique psychology—particularly among younger generations—where financial investments become a form of social identity.

According to Murad, a prominent expert in the field, meme coins are poised for a “supercycle” in 2025. This prediction is rooted in the idea that Gen Z and Millennials are drawn to strong communities and cult-like followings that offer more than just financial returns. For many, meme coins represent a fun and engaging way to participate in the crypto revolution, blending investment with entertainment and collective identity.

# The Power of Communities in Crypto

In the world of meme coins, communities are everything. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, where utility and technology often take center stage, the success of a meme coin depends heavily on its ability to foster a passionate and loyal following.

Strong communities act as the backbone of a project, helping it weather market dips and setbacks. These groups, often referred to as ""hardcore holders"" or ""cult-like believers,"" are fiercely committed to their chosen token. They don’t just hold through turbulence—they actively promote, defend, and grow the project. This sense of unity and shared purpose can make or break a meme coin.

# Why Saitama Reborn Stands Out

In my search for a meme coin with a strong community, I came across **Saitama Inu Reborn**. This project is the successor to the original **Saitama Inu**, which was one of the most iconic meme coins of 2021. At its peak, Saitama Inu reached a market cap of **$7 billion**, **becoming the third-largest meme coin in the world and boasting over 350,000 holders**. Its community, known as the ""Wolfpack,"" was legendary for its passion and dedication.

However, like so many projects in the crypto space, Saitama Inu fell victim to bad actors. The original developers betrayed their community, orchestrating a rug pull that left investors devastated. The fallout was so severe that the FBI intervened, arresting the developers for fraud and market manipulation.

But from the ashes of this betrayal, **Saitama Reborn** emerged. This isn’t just a new project—it’s a revival of one of the most passionate communities in crypto history. For me, Saitama Reborn is more than an investment opportunity; it’s a powerful statement against fraudulent developers and a testament to the resilience of dedicated communities.

# Why I Believe in Saitama Reborn

Currently, Saitama Reborn has faced a significant dip, falling from its all-time high of $13 million to a market cap of around $800,000. While this might deter some investors, I see it as an opportunity. The Wolfpack community continues to show resilience, working tirelessly to rebuild trust and momentum.

This aligns with a broader truth about life and investing: struggle leads to growth. Whether in markets or personal development, challenges are what make us stronger and wiser. Saitama Reborn embodies this principle, showing that even in the face of adversity, a strong community can rebuild and thrive.

Given its history, I believe Saitama Reborn has the potential to reclaim its former glory. If it were to reach its previous market cap of $7 billion, this would represent a staggering 7,000x increase from its current valuation.

Before investing in any meme coin, it’s crucial to do your own research and avoid chasing hype or green candles. Meme coins thrive on belief, community, and long-term commitment. Saitama Reborn stands out because it represents more than just financial gain—it’s a movement, a comeback story, and a rallying point for those who believe in the power of collective effort.

For anyone considering an investment, I encourage you to think beyond the short-term gains. Saitama Reborn is a project worth holding onto, not just during the highs but also through the storms. Stop trading and start believing—because in crypto, and in life, it’s the believers who ultimately win.

"Kripto Para Nedir?, Kripto Para Ne Demek?",yatirimdanismanligi,1i9qa7h,2025-01-25 11:11:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yatirimdanismanligi/comments/1i9qa7h/kripto_para_nedir_kripto_para_ne_demek/,dreaministanbul,,"Kripto para, dijital veya sanal bir para birimidir ve işlemleri güvenli hale getirmek için kriptografi teknolojisi kullanılır. Geleneksel para birimlerinden farklı olarak fiziksel bir şekli yoktur ve merkezi bir otorite tarafından kontrol edilmez. Kripto paralar, blockchain adı verilen dağıtık bir defter teknolojisi üzerinde çalışir. Bu teknoloji, tüm işlemlerin şeffaf ve değiştirilemez bir şekilde kaydedilmesini sağlar.

# Kripto Para Çeşitleri

Kripto paralar farklı amaçlara hizmet eden çeşitli türlere ayrılabilir:

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin, ilk ve en popüler kripto paradır. 2009 yılında Satoshi Nakamoto takma adıyla biri veya bir grup tarafından geliştirilmiştir. Dijital altın olarak da adlandırılan Bitcoin, bir değer saklama aracı ve ödeme sistemi olarak kullanılır.

# 2. Altcoin’ler

Bitcoin haricindeki tüm kripto paralar “altcoin” olarak adlandırılır. Bazı popüler altcoin’ler şunlardır:

* **Ethereum (ETH):** Akıllı sözleşmeler ve merkeziyetsiz uygulamalar (DApps) için bir platformdur.
* **Ripple (XRP):** Hızlı uluslararası ödeme sistemleri için kullanılır.
* **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’in daha hafif bir versiyonu olarak daha hızlı işlem yapılmasını sağlar.

# 3. Stablecoin’ler

Stablecoin’ler, fiyat dalgalanmasını azaltmak için itibari para birimlerine (USD, EUR gibi) veya altın gibi fiziksel varlıklara endekslenmiştir. Örnek: USDT (Tether), USDC.

# 4. Meme Coin’ler

Genellikle bir topluluk veya internet esprisi (meme) üzerine kurulu kripto paralardır. Örneğin, Dogecoin (DOGE) ve Shiba Inu (SHIB).

# 5. NFT’ler ve Token’lar

* **NFT’ler (Non-Fungible Tokens):** Sanat eserleri, koleksiyonlar ve dijital varlıkları temsil eder.
* **Token’lar:** Belirli bir platformda veya ekosistemde kullanılmak için oluşturulan dijital varlıklardır.

# Kripto Paranın Avantajları

Kripto paraları kullanmanın çok sayıda avantajı vardır:

# 1. Merkeziyetsizlik

Kripto paralar, herhangi bir merkezi otoriteye bağlı olmadığı için daha şeffaf ve özgür bir finansal sistem sunar.

# 2. Hızlı ve Düşük Maliyetli İşlemler

Kripto para transferleri genellikle çok hızlıdır ve geleneksel bankacılık sistemine göre daha düşük üretlere sahiptir.

# 3. Sınırsız ve Evrensel Erişim

Kripto paraları kullanmak için bir banka hesabına gerek yoktur. Bir internet bağlantısına sahip herkes, dünyanın her yerinden bu paralara erişebilir.

# 4. Yatırım Fırsatları

Kripto paralar, yüksek getirili bir [**yatırım**](https://yatirimdanismanligi.com/) aracı olarak popülerlik kazanmıştır. Bitcoin gibi bazı kripto paralar uzun vadeli yatırımlar için tercih edilmektedir.

# 5. Güvenlik

Blockchain teknolojisi, verilerin değiştirilemez ve güvenli bir şekilde saklanmasını sağlar. Bu da kripto paraları geleneksel sistemlere göre daha güvenli hale getirir.

# Kripto Paranın Riskleri

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken dikkate alınması gereken bazı önemli riskler vardır:

# 1. Fiyat Dalgalanması (Volatilite)

Kripto paraların değeri kısa süre içinde büyük ölçülerde artabilir veya azalabilir. Bu, yüksek kâr getirme potansiyeli olduğu kadar yüksek kayıp riskini de beraberinde getirir.

# 2. Siber Güvenlik Riskleri

Kripto para borsalarının hacklenmesi veya bireysel cüzdanların ele geçirilmesi durumunda kayıplar yaşanabilir.

# 3. Regülasyon ve Yasal Belirsizlikler

Birçok ülkede kripto paraların yasal durumu tam olarak netleşmemiştir. Bu da yasal riskler doğurabilir.

# 4. Teknik Bilgi Eksikliği

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken teknik bilgi eksikliği yanlış kararlar alınmasına neden olabilir.

# 5. Dolandırıcılık ve Ponzi Yapılar

Bazı sahte projeler ve dolandırıcılık amaçlı kripto para girşimleri, yatırımcıları büyük kayıplara uğratabilir.

Kripto paralar, modern finans dünyasını yeniden şekillendiren bir yenilik olarak dikkat çekiyor. Avantajları ve yatırım fırsatları cazip olsa da, beraberinde getirdiği riskleri dikkatlice değerlendirmek önemlidir. Kripto paralara yönelik bir yatırım yapmadan önce detaylı bir araştırma yapmak ve finansal durumunuzu göz önünde bulundurmak önemlidir.

I should really stop playing these Win a Box events,lrcast,1i9o9qf,2025-01-25 09:38:09,22,0.87,23,https://i.redd.it/ilekrn4ri5fe1.jpeg,Zweck-los,,
The Next Big Thing: REAL Competitive Trading - $RED vs $BLUE,Moonshotcoins,1i9o8xg,2025-01-25 09:37:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moonshotcoins/comments/1i9o8xg/the_next_big_thing_real_competitive_trading_red/,ILikeWeirdHumans,,"Memecoin cults are all the rage on Crypto Twitter right now. But why settle for just one when you can have two?

## The Basics

- **Two Tokens:** Choose your favorite—$RED or $BLUE. When the supply of your token hits zero, your side takes the victory and the rewards!
- **Dynamic HP System:** Each token starts with 10B HP (its supply), which can increase to 21B. Every purchase chips away at your rival’s HP while boosting your own.
- **GameMaster in Control:** A smart contract handles it all autonomously—dynamic pricing, ETH redistribution, and price updates based on Uniswap pools for extra strategy.

## What’s in It for You?

- **Community-Driven Rewards:** 70% of every purchase fuels the final reward pool, which returns to the community (unlike other projects who take 80% for themselves 👀).
- **Winner Takes All:** If your token wins, you get a share of the reward pool based on how much you hold. Own 1% of the supply? You’ll take 1% of the prize pool.
- **No Shady Business:** Liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced, and there are no insider wallets or token allocation. 

## More Green Flags?

- Total transparency. No rugs. Ownership renounced for ultimate peace of mind. If you any questions, I'll answer personally.
- Zero trading fees, just a 5% dev fee on GameMaster buys.
- This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s a tactical war where timing and strategy count.

## Ready to Pick a Side?

1️⃣ Head over to [redvblue.xyz](https://redvblue.xyz)
2️⃣ Buy* your favorite token, $RED or $BLUE

The Next Big Thing: REAL Competitive Trading - $RED vs $BLUE,CryptoMars,1i9o7w5,2025-01-25 09:35:37,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/1i9o7w5/the_next_big_thing_real_competitive_trading_red/,ILikeWeirdHumans,ETHEREUM,"Memecoin cults are all the rage on Crypto Twitter right now. But why settle for just one when you can have two?

## The Basics

- **Two Tokens:** Choose your favorite—$RED or $BLUE. When the supply of your token hits zero, your side takes the victory and the rewards!
- **Dynamic HP System:** Each token starts with 10B HP (its supply), which can increase to 21B. Every purchase chips away at your rival’s HP while boosting your own.
- **GameMaster in Control:** A smart contract handles it all autonomously—dynamic pricing, ETH redistribution, and price updates based on Uniswap pools for extra strategy.

## What’s in It for You?

- **Community-Driven Rewards:** 70% of every purchase fuels the final reward pool, which returns to the community (unlike other projects who take 80% for themselves 👀).
- **Winner Takes All:** If your token wins, you get a share of the reward pool based on how much you hold. Own 1% of the supply? You’ll take 1% of the prize pool.
- **No Shady Business:** Liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced, and there are no insider wallets or token allocation. 

## More Green Flags?

- Total transparency. No rugs. Ownership renounced for ultimate peace of mind. If you any questions, I'll answer personally.
- Zero trading fees, just a 5% dev fee on GameMaster buys.
- This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s a tactical war where timing and strategy count.

📈 **Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory, Is This Good Or Bad For Price?**

In a recent development, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin long-term holders have officially entered greed territory. This could benefit the price in the short term, although the long-term consequences could be severe. [Source](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-lths-in-greed-territory/)



**Overall:**

ETFs remain at the center of crypto market narratives, bringing the potential for significant inflows—especially if recent proposals receive the green light. BTC’s dual signals of FOMO-driven short-term interest and rising long-term greed suggest a market prone to volatility but underpinned by solid demand. Meanwhile, Trump’s hands-on involvement and Solana’s high-profile memecoin activity highlight how rapidly politics and hype can reshape the industry’s direction. As always, market participants should balance optimism with caution in this fast-evolving environment.

This Precon is a Letdown,mtg,1i9iqnz,2025-01-25 03:38:45,0,0.22,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9iqnz,MTGReaper,Discussion,"The full decklist for the Living Energy precon is out, and personally, I'm not that impressed. For a deck that is going for a preorder price of $46 on amazon right now, I expected more.

For starters, the two commanders: for being our first two real temur energy commanders, they're both just mediocre energy generators and creature token generators to feed your energy into.

Saheeli is basically temur Satya with a more blatent artificer tribal/artifacts-matter theme stamped on her. She's even the same CMC. The only positive side is that her energy generation is far less risky and more consistent than Satya, and she can copy any permanent you control, but even then the tokens she makes are sacrificed at the next end step, so you can't even slowly build an army with her. She is clearly the superior commander choice in this precon considering all the other cards in the deck, which is a shame because she's just the temur version of Satya. It's uninspired.

Pia is a combat-centric battery that cares about artifact creatures only and does nothing to make energy on her own if you cant get damage through. Her design is also desperately trying to shoehorn in the vehicles theme of the Aetherdrift set into energy decks in a way that is counter-intuitive to how the deck already functions. There's plenty of flying creatures and thopter token generators in the deck so why would I want to waste time tapping out creatures to crew a bad outlet for my energy production? Yeah, flying is nice, but the thopters already do that and I'd like some blockers to keep me alive and in the fight. This really just feels like a bad outlet for your energy production.

Neither commander option does anything for card draw like Dr. Madison or Liberty Prime, and the energy theme overall feels like the production is half decent, but aside from a select few cards, the outlets for the energy generated here sucks.

Aethersquall Ancient is a decent card, but it's such a massive investment that also hits your creatures, and in a deck that is all about creature token generation, you likely don't want to wipe yourself, so it's likely going to just be a 6/6 flying energy generator, and that's if it even survives to your upkeep.

Aetherwind Basker is great for energy generation and smashing face by pouring all your energy into it. I wish one of the commander options would have had something that gave an energy firebreathing ability to all your creatures like what Basker has, that would have been sick!

Architect of the Untamed and the new Nissa are great, but why not also slot in Roil Cartographer and Primal Prayers? Cartographer would be a great addition to the energy landfall lineup, and Prayers would have been another great option for getting out the smaller creatures while putting your mana towards the bigger stuff, and both cost less than $1! Why are we reprinting Combustable Gearhulk into the ground when it's crap in this deck when we could be putting in better, more synergistic cards!?

The new Peema Trailblazer is good. Too bad exhaust as a new ability sucks outside of blink decks.

Rampaging Aetherhood is a gem in this deck, it should go in any and every energy deck that can have it. Passive energy generation that can be funneled immediately back into the generator to make it bigger and produce more energy is amazint, but then to stack trample and ward 2 on it is just so overkill that it needs to be in any energy deck that has green. It's just too good to pass up. Considering how weak green is compared to red, white, and blue in the energy generarion department, I won't say this is entirely a bad thing.

Territorial Aetherkite is either going to be a board wipe or just a hasty 6/5 flier that gave you 2 energy. Either way, in a deck that wants to make a lot of tokens to swarm for damage, this card is mid at best.

Adaptive Omnitool isn't bad, but it very clearly is meant for a voltron deck. In a deck that has 25 other artifacts besides this one, odds are in your favor that you's grab an artifact off of the triggered ability. It's unfortunate that not all the artifacts included are ones I'd be happy to rummage for in this deck. Midnight Clock? Soul-Guide Lantern? Combustable Gearhulk? Duplicant? Really? You couldn't put an Izzet Generatorium or a Conversion Apparatus or a Phyrexian Ironworks or an Electrostatic Pummeler in there? And that's just naming a few suggestions. I get that this deck is a precon, but there are plenty of dirt cheap cards you could have slotted in here that would have been better choices.

Or, I don't know, maybe remove a land or two! 38 lands? Really? You could play on curve just fine with 35-36 lands. Come on.

At least we get another new must-have for artifact decks. Aetherflux Conduit is another card that must go in every energy deck it can. Hell, it's good enough to go in any deck that wants it. Generating energy by just playing then game, and then getting to cast spells for free? Yeah, that's going to go in a lot of decks. Explains why it's one of the higher value new cards coming out of the precons.

Speaking of, I see where all the actual monetary value went in this deck. Save for some of the new cards, most of the value of this deck is eaten up by reprints of stuff like Chromatic Lantern, Conjurer's Closet, Lightning Greaves, Disallow, and biggest of them all, Academy Ruins. I wonder if reprints will actually drive down prices or if it'll just be like Sol Ring and barely change anything if at all!

This deck is a poorly-tuned mess that doesnt have many good outlets for energy to go into for what the deck is trying to do. The deck is clearly about creature token production, capitalizing on getting damage through with fliers, and an overall artifacts-matter theme. You could very easily tune this into a thopter tribal theme with an energy subtheme for Pia or a general goodstuff artifact deck for Saheeli and you'd probably have more fun with this deck than it's out-of-the-box deck list. It is trying so hard to justify the $46 pricetag with that Academy Ruins and few other goodies, but you could easily build a better deck for that same price.

Aetherdrift as a whole is such a waste of a set, this is just fuel in that fire. This will be the MKM set of 2025, and that's a damn shame."

[PC][2000-2010] WildTangent's triangle grid puzzle game,tipofmyjoystick,1i9fwxl,2025-01-25 00:20:24,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1i9fwxl/pc20002010_wildtangents_triangle_grid_puzzle_game/,Cheetah-shooter,,"Platform(s): PC, pre-installed on Windows XP system of an HP(?) computer

Genre: Puzzle

Estimated year of release: 2000-2010

Graphics/art style: Ancient, ruinous, with green/blue/purple gem/stone-like(?) puzzle pieces, I didn't know what Aztec was at the time but retrospectively it is likely a temple in the jungle, but that's most of the puzzle games at that era

Notable characters: None

Notable gameplay mechanics: I remember there is a ""delivery belt"" scrolling where you have pick up and place puzzle pieces into a grid, I forgot what the win conditions are but it should be completing the grid. Some pieces are like a hexagon missing one triangle, or a single triangle piece that is a saving grace for last few gaps. I remember it was extremely stressful when the belt was nearly full even when I was a young kid, maybe some ""scary"" warnings that were just red flashing borders? And iirc there are levels where the time limit doesn't apply at all which was way more fun for me.

Other details: While I was playing on some in-built WildTangent app on PC, I couldn't find it as one of the games that WildTangent itself published, so I am not sure if it is another similar demo gaming app. However, it is at least in the same era as WildTangent having the purple logo and requiring some purple tokens to play the game for a limited time. I have memories of playing Bounce, Polar Bowler, Zuma, Blasterball, Ocean Express, Overball (on a different computer), Chicken Invaders 1, 2 (distinctly liked it because solar system was one of my favourite thing when I was a kid), not sure about 3. It helped me narrow down the time to the noughties. I have found all those games around it just by searching online but couldn't find that specific puzzle game."

Alchemy Stars was one of the games that you could tell that the devs actually cared for the game.

* An amazing main story (one of the few gacha stories that I actually was into).
* Cool events and lots of minigames.
* Great soundtrack ([Fateful Chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNNQI-6Fgh4), [Eye of the Storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LynO-fjD5Hc), [Bathed in the Midnight Sun](https://youtu.be/NnonmDepK8I?t=1318), [For Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_n_ON1u4Cw), and many others).
* I really liked the characters design and the world build with the different factions. They even started to create some specialized mechanics for some groups (Sanity system for True Order, enhanced tiles for green, field tokens for blue).
* Multiple QoL and good response for some of the feedbacks from the community.
* They also made the cloud garden. I know there were some complains, but man, I loved to create my particular world so I could have some extra interactions with the aurorians. I'm really sad they didn't put it on the offline version, It actually would be a very good way to continue playing since it take time to grind stuff.

Well, I just wanted to make this appreciation post to thanks the amazing time spent on the game and with the community. Good fortune on your future journeys fellows navigators :)

PS: I wanted to share some shots from my garden. Unfortunately, I could't complete it, but I'm still pretty proud of it.

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered"
Choosing an Energy Commander - Jeskai or Temur?,EDH,1i97mx6,2025-01-24 17:16:46,5,0.78,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1i97mx6/choosing_an_energy_commander_jeskai_or_temur/,MaskedThespian,Discussion,"So, a couple of months ago I was in a position to purchase both the Creative Energy precon and the SCIENCE! precon decks, so I did so with the aim of merging them and modifying what came out into a deck based around the use of Energy, something I’d been planning ever since the original Kaladesh set was first released.  I built the deck with [[Satya, Aetherflux Genius]] as the Commander, as I felt that both [[Liberty Prime, Recharged]] and [[Dr. Madison Li]] (the only other three-colour Commander options that actually generated and/or used Energy counters themselves) were more Artifact Commanders with a sideline in Energy.  I’ve played four games with this deck and won two of them, but I’ve had fun with it in all four games.

Now Wizards are releasing the new Living Energy precon deck, in Temur colours, with two new Commander options in [[Saheeli, Radiant Creator]] and [[Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic]], making me second guess my choice to stay with Jeskai.  Here are my thoughts on the five Commanders presented here:

* Satya seems to me like the best overall “Energy” Commander, in that he creates Energy and uses Energy with no caveats other than needing to attack.  And with Menace and Toughness 5, he usually survives the Attack Step as long as I'm careful.  His ability also can go infinite with a couple of other cards such as [[Port Razer]] and [[Lightning Runner]] and whilst that’s not the primary way I’d like to win, it’s always nice to have combos in the deck to end long games.

* Liberty Prime, as mentioned above, feels like more of an Artifact Commander.  Even though he needs Energy to survive blocking or attacking, due to his Tap ability it feels like he needs to be leading an Artifact deck to make the best use of it as sacrificing Artifacts is the only way he makes Energy himself.  Since I want this to be an “Energy” deck, I don’t think it’s a great idea to have him lead this deck.

* Similarly, Madison Li only generates Energy when I cast Artifacts.  Even though she is has several useful Tap abilities that require the spending on Energy, as she only generates Energy when I cast Artifacts, it again feels like she’s more of an Artifact Commander as I need them to make Energy with her.

* Oddly enough, Pia Nalaar also feels like an Artifact Commander, seeing as she generates Energy from having Artifact Creatures deal combat damage to players.  The fact that all she does with her Energy is creating Vehicles, albeit evasive and potentially very large ones that will also generate more Energy in the future, also makes me think that her deck would also be an Artifact deck.

* On the other hand, Saheeli can generate Energy without Artifacts, and as there are currently 138 other Artificers in her colour combination, it feels like I could make her deck work without an Artifact focus.  Like Satya, she makes token copies of things I control, though hers are guaranteed to go away at the end of the turn, but she can also copy non-Creatures, making me wonder what combos I could create with her.

With this in mind, my preferred Commander choices are Satya and Saheeli.  I think I'd be happy with a deck built around either of these cards.

Ignoring the specific Commander, is there any particular Energy-related reason I should choose White over Green or vice versa?  White has some nice cards that I’ve already seen in action including [[Aetherstom Roc]], [[Localized Destruction]], [[Razorfield Ripper]] (which won me one of my two wins), and [[Wrath of the Skies]], as well as several I’d like to try but don’t own copies of yet, including [[Emissary of Soulfire]], [[Guide of Souls]], [[Suppression Ray]], and [[Voltstorm Angel]].  I’ve not played any games with Green yet, but some cards that look nice include [[Aetherwind Basker]], [[Architect of the Untamed]], [[Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker]], and [[Primal Prayers]].

Thanks in advance for anyone who helps me with this."

Solana (SOL): will its price surpass $300?,CapitalistExploits,1i93rue,2025-01-24 14:30:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i93rue/solana_sol_will_its_price_surpass_300/,kayakero,,"Solana (SOL) continues to show a strong upward trend. The altcoin, which had seen a dip during Donald Trump's inauguration, has recovered and is once again trading above $250. Against this backdrop, traders and investors are wondering whether SOL will be able to reach a new all-time high.

**Solana resumes bullish trend**

Since January 13, Solana has been in a clear upward trend. This movement reached its all-time high (ATH) of $293 last Sunday, January 19, according to data from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana).

The asset subsequently had a brief correction, validating the 50% Fibonacci retracement level as support. Moreover, the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) also acted as an important support point in this process.

Following this recent momentum, buyers are now attempting to break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level located at $265. If they manage to sustain SOL price above this level, there are high chances of it approaching its ATH again.

If the all-time high is surpassed, the Fibonacci projection tool suggests that the next target would be at $357.

https://preview.redd.it/437bt08r9qee1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=20350b8fc7f4c5de839b8d62690798eee70536d5

However, the current low trading volume raises doubts about this scenario. Historically, upward movements that are not accompanied by high volumes tend to be unsustainable.

# Divergences in technical indicators

The ADX, which measures the strength of the prevailing trend, is on the upside and is near 30, indicating that despite low volume, buyers are gaining ground in the market.

The MACD also supports this trend. This indicator, which had already shown a bullish crossover, continues to form increasingly larger green bars.

https://preview.redd.it/v89don4t9qee1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb65369ad98a722539b4a855461dfb45c8e403d

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is causing concern. With values ​​close to the 70 limit, further price increases could push SOL into an overbought state. This could make it difficult for buyers to push Solana price beyond $300 and sustain it above that level.

**Solana Network Activity**

The increase in activity within the Solana network is one of the reasons behind this bullish movement. Solana has established itself as a reference blockchain, especially in the memecoin space. It is no coincidence that Donald Trump and his wife Melania chose this network to launch their official meme coins.

Furthermore, the Solaxy project promises to take the network to a new level as Solana’s first layer-two (L2) solution. By operating as an L2, it offers increased speed and scalability compared to the main SOL blockchain.

Solaxy already has a native token, SOLX, currently in the pre-sale stage. Interested users have until Thursday 23 to acquire the token at a discount and access benefits such as staking.

I used to stream to spelltable via virtual cam on OBS to have an overlay for tokens and such.

Some days ago it stopped to function and I can't seem to figure out why. I added the chroma key as usual on green and put the green screen on moxfield on like it used to work. OBS (or my camera) now don't filter it out.  
It filters it out just fine with a green deck box for example.

There is a quote on the chroma key settings saying: ""Only works on SDR videos""  can it relate to that?  
I already asked over at the OBS reddit but didn't get any answers.

I have a C920 as a webcam and use a 4k screen as the streamed moxfield and a ultrawide 2k for spelltable browser if that anyhow matters.

If I enable the overlay of my greenscreen moxfield it just shows green and chroma key does not care.

Why I Believe Saitama Reborn is Massively Undervalued,AllCryptoBets,1i931ce,2025-01-24 13:59:40,11,0.83,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i931ce/why_i_believe_saitama_reborn_is_massively/,Exotic-Midnight-6028,Memecoin,"# My Journey in Crypto

I began trading cryptocurrency around mid-2023, diving headfirst into what has been an exhilarating yet often frustrating journey. Early on, I dedicated countless hours to research—reading whitepapers, analyzing roadmaps, and trying to make calculated decisions. While I managed a few small wins, my tendency to rotate into other projects too quickly often erased any gains I made.

Time and again, I would sell tokens for modest profits, only to watch them skyrocket after I exited. These missed opportunities taught me a hard lesson about the dangers of over-rotation and the importance of patience in investing.

After enduring several cycles of frustration, I pivoted towards meme coins. At first, I thought I’d found my niche, but even this sector wasn’t without its challenges. Rug pulls, exorbitant gas fees, and overtrading continued to hinder my progress. I knew I had to refine my approach if I wanted to succeed.

# The Unique Appeal of Meme Coins

Meme coins are unlike any other asset class in the crypto space. What started with Dogecoin as a joke has evolved into a phenomenon, driven by communities that rally around humor, shared beliefs, and a sense of belonging. These coins tap into a unique psychology—particularly among younger generations—where financial investments become a form of social identity.

According to Murad, a prominent expert in the field, meme coins are poised for a “supercycle” in 2025. This prediction is rooted in the idea that Gen Z and Millennials are drawn to strong communities and cult-like followings that offer more than just financial returns. For many, meme coins represent a fun and engaging way to participate in the crypto revolution, blending investment with entertainment and collective identity.

# The Power of Communities in Crypto

In the world of meme coins, communities are everything. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, where utility and technology often take center stage, the success of a meme coin depends heavily on its ability to foster a passionate and loyal following.

Strong communities act as the backbone of a project, helping it weather market dips and setbacks. These groups, often referred to as ""hardcore holders"" or ""cult-like believers,"" are fiercely committed to their chosen token. They don’t just hold through turbulence—they actively promote, defend, and grow the project. This sense of unity and shared purpose can make or break a meme coin.

# Why Saitama Reborn Stands Out

In my search for a meme coin with a strong community, I came across **Saitama Inu Reborn**. This project is the successor to the original **Saitama Inu**, which was one of the most iconic meme coins of 2021. At its peak, Saitama Inu reached a market cap of **$7 billion**, **becoming the third-largest meme coin in the world and boasting over 350,000 holders**. Its community, known as the ""Wolfpack,"" was legendary for its passion and dedication.

However, like so many projects in the crypto space, Saitama Inu fell victim to bad actors. The original developers betrayed their community, orchestrating a rug pull that left investors devastated. The fallout was so severe that the FBI intervened, arresting the developers for fraud and market manipulation.

But from the ashes of this betrayal, **Saitama Reborn** emerged. This isn’t just a new project—it’s a revival of one of the most passionate communities in crypto history. For me, Saitama Reborn is more than an investment opportunity; it’s a powerful statement against fraudulent developers and a testament to the resilience of dedicated communities.

# Why I Believe in Saitama Reborn

Currently, Saitama Reborn has faced a significant dip, falling from its all-time high of $13 million to a market cap of around $800,000. While this might deter some investors, I see it as an opportunity. The Wolfpack community continues to show resilience, working tirelessly to rebuild trust and momentum.

This aligns with a broader truth about life and investing: struggle leads to growth. Whether in markets or personal development, challenges are what make us stronger and wiser. Saitama Reborn embodies this principle, showing that even in the face of adversity, a strong community can rebuild and thrive.

Given its history, I believe Saitama Reborn has the potential to reclaim its former glory. If it were to reach its previous market cap of $7 billion, this would represent a staggering 7,000x increase from its current valuation.

Before investing in any meme coin, it’s crucial to do your own research and avoid chasing hype or green candles. Meme coins thrive on belief, community, and long-term commitment. Saitama Reborn stands out because it represents more than just financial gain—it’s a movement, a comeback story, and a rallying point for those who believe in the power of collective effort.

For anyone considering an investment, I encourage you to think beyond the short-term gains. Saitama Reborn is a project worth holding onto, not just during the highs but also through the storms. Stop trading and start believing—because in crypto, and in life, it’s the believers who ultimately win.

The Next Big Thing: REAL Competitive Trading - $RED vs $BLUE,memecoins,1i8wfmk,2025-01-24 09:20:16,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i8wfmk/the_next_big_thing_real_competitive_trading_red/,ILikeWeirdHumans,Base,"Memecoin cults are all the rage on Crypto Twitter right now. But why settle for just one when you can have two?

## The Basics

- **Two Tokens:** Choose your favorite—$RED or $BLUE. When the supply of your token hits zero, your side takes the victory and the rewards!
- **Dynamic HP System:** Each token starts with 10B HP (its supply), which can increase to 21B. Every purchase chips away at your rival’s HP while boosting your own.
- **GameMaster in Control:** A smart contract handles it all autonomously—dynamic pricing, ETH redistribution, and price updates based on Uniswap pools for extra strategy.

## What’s in It for You?

- **Community-Driven Rewards:** 70% of every purchase fuels the final reward pool, which returns to the community (unlike other projects who take 80% for themselves 👀).
- **Winner Takes All:** If your token wins, you get a share of the reward pool based on how much you hold. Own 1% of the supply? You’ll take 1% of the prize pool.
- **No Shady Business:** Liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced, and there are no insider wallets or token allocation. 

## More Green Flags?

- Total transparency. No rugs. Ownership renounced for ultimate peace of mind. If you any questions, I'll answer personally.
- Zero trading fees, just a 5% dev fee on GameMaster buys.
- This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s a tactical war where timing and strategy count.

- **Community-Driven Rewards:** 70% of every purchase fuels the final reward pool, which returns to the community (unlike other projects who take 80% for themselves 👀).
- **Winner Takes All:** If your token wins, you get a share of the reward pool based on how much you hold. Own 1% of the supply? You’ll take 1% of the prize pool.
- **No Shady Business:** Liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced, and there are no insider wallets or token allocation. 

## More Green Flags?

- Total transparency. No rugs. Ownership renounced for ultimate peace of mind. If you any questions, I'll answer personally.
- Zero trading fees, just a 5% dev fee on GameMaster buys.
- This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s a tactical war where timing and strategy count.

Tales from the Trenches Part 17,AnarchyOnSol,1i8rh5g,2025-01-24 04:15:03,25,0.96,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyOnSol/comments/1i8rh5g/tales_from_the_trenches_part_17/,Cassius23,,"This is an ongoing series designed to teach people about crypto safety using stories.

These stories have been changed to protect the identity of the victim but are very much based in real world scenarios and describe an instance where a crypto asset owner got their wallet drained due to hostile actors.

Underneath is what the user could have done to avoid the hack.  

The goal is to learn from other people's mistakes.

If you have any ideas for future stories, let me know in the comments.

Let's continue.

Victim: 27 year old man

Scenario: John slammed down his phone, almost cracking it.  Somehow his now ex girlfriend cheating on him was his fault.  He felt tears rising but held them back because he wanted to be strong.  To distract himself he went on social media and vented about how breaking up sucks.  

Later on he got a DM from Alyssa.  Her profile picture was very attractive, a redhead with bright green eyes.  She said she saw his post and it was a pity that someone as handsome as he was got cheated on and how he should get with a good Irish woman while telling him about her life in Dublin.  

Over the days John started thinking about his new life with Alyssa.  She started sending him lewd pictures and said wonderful things when he did the same.  It felt like his brain was flooded with joy.  He had a hard time thinking or focusing on anything that didn't center Alyssa.

They were talking about plans for him to come out and visit her in Dublin when she had an idea.  She knew he was into crypto(he talked about it a lot) and her sister's boyfriend was talking about how some sort of ""cabal"" was talking about ""running up"" something called ""$BRANCH"".  Maybe he could do something with that information?

John immediately understood.  $BRANCH was an old asset that was created in the old CrashPalace days and everyone in crypto assumed it was a dead asset.  It would be easy for a cabal to buy it up and sell at the peak.  

He immediately bought $20,000 worth of $BRANCH.  The price immediately spiked and immediately went to 0.  

He never saw or heard from Alyssa again.


How to avoid:  This is a modern variation on a very old scam.  One of the things to understand about this is something called ""New Relationship Energy"" or NRE.  In a nutshell, when you form a new bond, especially a romantic one, your brain chemically validates what you did.  This can be very pleasant but can also be used against you as you see in our story.

Instead of carefully examining $BRANCH, he just bought without thinking.  If he would have looked closer he would have seen that 95% of all tokens were owner by a single wallet and that it was an obvious pump and dump.

The harsh truth is this.  Romance is incredibly hard in the year of our Lord 2025 and 99.99% of the faces you see on social media aren't real, especially if those faces are attractive and belong to a woman.

Treat every contact on social media as a serious potential threat

Stay vigilant.

Protect against duplicating company 365 login page,sysadmin,1i8r9wd,2025-01-24 03:59:29,0,0.33,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1i8r9wd/protect_against_duplicating_company_365_login_page/,Important_Ad_3602,,"So i've been reading a lot about MitM attacks and protecting our company against it.

I've already concluded we need to use Windows Hello, device certificates, or hardware tokens. This will work for company devices, but it won't for privately owned / byo devices. Typically they will still rely on password and mfa, plus user wariness.

It's the latter i (and probably every sysadmin) is worried about. Battling user stupidity is the hardest part of our job. Commonly users are expected to look at the url, green certificate shield, etc. But we all know they won't. Some might, when they've completed their fake login and aren't forwarded to the requested app.

What i've been thinking was to have the 365 login page be so unique, hackers won't be able to duplicate it. By using a predifined word or image per user, known to only user. This would have to be securely retrieved from somewhere.  
  
Does anyone know if something like this exists?"
"Sam Wilson and  Miles Morales ARE NOT ""Token characters""",Th3Birdman,1i8q84o,2025-01-24 02:37:57,24,0.96,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Th3Birdman/comments/1i8q84o/sam_wilson_and_miles_morales_are_not_token/,ShadowOfDespair666,,"I can’t stand when people call Sam Wilson and Miles Morales ""token characters"" or refuse to acknowledge Miles as Spider-Man, saying, ""He’s not Spider-Man."" That logic falls apart for several reasons. Many iconic characters weren’t the originals either. For example, Barry Allen wasn’t the first Flash—Jay Garrick was. Alan Scott was the first Green Lantern, and Carter Slade was the first Ghost Rider. Yet you don’t see these so-called ""fans"" claiming, ""Barry Allen isn’t the Flash"" or ""Johnny Blaze isn’t Ghost Rider."" They’re perfectly fine with characters inheriting mantles—as long as the new character is white. They had no issue with Bucky becoming Captain America or Terry McGinnis becoming Batman. The outrage only seems to come when characters of color take up mantles previously held by white characters."
"There is nothing wrong with Sam Wilson being Captain America, and there is nothing wrong with Miles Morales being Spider-Man.",Marvel,1i8pz1g,2025-01-24 02:19:14,867,0.79,430,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1i8pz1g/there_is_nothing_wrong_with_sam_wilson_being/,ShadowOfDespair666,Comics ,"A lot of people call Sam Wilson and Miles Morales ""token"" characters, and they don't consider Sam Wilson ""Captain America"" or Miles Morales ""Spider-Man."" Because of this, I find it ironic. They never call any other characters that took the mantles of other heroes ""token.""

Barry Allen might be the more iconic Flash, but Barry wasn't the first—Jay Garrick was. Hal Jordan wasn't the first Green Lantern—Alan Scott was. Yet no one calls Barry Allen, Hal Jordan, or Terry McGinnis ""token characters."" They only use this term for characters who are not white and take the mantle.

These people had no problems whatsoever with Terry McGinnis becoming Batman, but they have a problem with Miles Morales. There is nothing wrong with liking the original characters. If you think Peter Parker is the better and definitive Spider-Man, you'd be right. When most people think ""Captain America,"" they think Steve Rogers. When people think ""Spider-Man,"" they think Peter Parker.

But that doesn't mean other characters can't take the mantle. By that logic, Robbie Reyes is also a token character, and so is Danny Ketch. Honestly, even Johnny Blaze could be considered one because Johnny wasn't the OG Ghost Rider.

Let's also take into account that the multiverse exists. You can have someone else become Spider-Man. You can have a universe where Peter Parker is a cool, brooding jock, Uncle Ben is a sexy young construction worker, and Aunt May is a model or something. You can have a universe where Harry Osborn gets bitten by the spider, and he basically becomes a Batman × Spider-Man hybrid—he’s a billionaire with a spider cave, spider mobile, and his own Alfred, etc.

These people just have problems with POC taking on the mantle of white characters. They have no problem with white characters taking on the mantle of other white characters (e.g., Jay Garrick/Barry Allen, Alan Scott/Hal Jordan). What further proves my point is that they didn’t have a problem with Bucky becoming Captain America, but when Sam became Captain America, suddenly it’s an issue. They had no problem with Ben Reilly, Miguel O’Hara, or Kaine becoming Spider-Man, but for Miles, it’s a problem."
How to dynamically change the color/mood of lighting,OwlbearRodeo,1i8ptw5,2025-01-24 02:08:41,8,0.9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OwlbearRodeo/comments/1i8ptw5/how_to_dynamically_change_the_colormood_of/,Exposed_Wiring,,"I've tried both Smoke and Spectre, and the native Dynamic Lighting from Owlbear. I know how to set up both primary and secondary ""lights"" meaning ""vision"" in these extensions, but what I want to do is change the character/mood of a scene using color to show things like torches and campfires

I can easily change the time of day by putting a locked rectangle with a dark blue mostly transparent fill over the whole map. Boom. it's night time. But actual torch lighting? Not an option. When a player moves with dynamic fog, their ""vision"" is just going to reveal the night time part of the map, but what I'd like them to reveal is a bit more.... lit up? I could attach a whiteish/yellowish translucent circle to their token, but then the ""night"" rectangle and the yellow circle just make the area around the character green and hard to read. The circles also pass through walls, which isn't very fun.   
  
It would be awesome if I could somehow put a color to the lights so that not only does it reveal the fog, but even when you aren't in a fogged area, it can ""light up"" the map to give the impression of a closing in darkness. It also means that I can focus on making maps just for daytime and then run them at light or at day in owlbear. Is this supported somewhere somehow? Or just wishful thinking?"

Overall, I’m seeking advice on how best to set this list up. I’ve gone through many reworks, most recently I’ve applied The Cube Theory to my list. I’m also painfully aware that I likely need to include Deadly Rolick and Tear Asunder for the sake of stronger removal. Toxic Deluge is a card I do have that I’m considering mainboarding. As for my overall plan? My mind gears towards utilizing Lathril as much as possible. Use her potential for early damage and find ways to make her unblockable, use her to generate numbers, use mass untap mechanics to utilize her final ability as much as possible. Contingencies like going wide in place, having enough mass protection spells and mass recursion. As for my list? Call it as budget CEDH as I possibly can get it, lol. Also, as I was just recently informed, I know that Lathril isn’t CEDH material. That isn’t stopping me from wanting to make her as good as possible. However, I do note that my creature base is lacking compared to what I aimed for previously. Which was balancing my number of creatures with my total number of other pieces. Maybe I’m trying to do too much? The sideboard is another thing I’m going crazy over too. Help.

Why I Favor DeFi Over Bitcoin: A Perspective on Digital Currency's Evolution,Bitcoin,1i8lv8a,2025-01-23 22:09:46,0,0.1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i8lv8a/why_i_favor_defi_over_bitcoin_a_perspective_on/,Sea-Leadership-3921,,"

Let's first establish three premises:
1. Anything can be considered money as long as it fulfills three functions: store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.
2. Finance, in essence, is simply the transfer of money either between different time periods for the same person or between different people.
3. If I force you to accept something, it inevitably means I'm harming your interests. Many people defend fiat currency, and even defend inflation... what strange illness have they caught?

Bitcoin's units are too large, while Satoshis are too small, and with an increasingly scarce supply, people tend to hoard it. Therefore, it only fulfills the first function of money - store of value. If it withdraws from circulation and no longer serves as a medium of exchange, it becomes nothing more than a second gold. Gold was priced at $35 per ounce in 1973, and today it's $2,570, a 70-fold increase. However, by 1980, gold was already at $800, meaning that of the 70-fold increase, 23-fold occurred in the first seven years, while only a 3-fold increase happened over the next 40 years.

Once a currency exits the circulation sphere, its value takes a significant hit. This is what happened to gold, and I believe the same story will unfold with Bitcoin.

If we view Bitcoin as representing store of value, and meme coins as representing medium of exchange, then digital currency has another function - finance. After DeFi emerged, numerous scammers appeared, launching worthless tokens and running away with money. This is actually a phase that every new industry must face - whether it's solar power or electric vehicles... which sector hasn't gone through a period plagued by scammers?

However, after understanding DeFi, it becomes clear that compared to traditional finance, it can significantly reduce interest rates while multiplying profits for credit practitioners. Just as the internet once dominated over printing presses, DeFi will dominate over banks. This is a true dimensional reduction attack.

Controlling the dominance of the DeFi industry is equivalent to writing the underlying protocols for the World Wide Web back then. If this is once again led by the United States, then the U.S. government's $35 trillion debt could be transferred to those countries whose domestic experts and scholars are still debating whether Bitcoin is money or not.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

AI memecoin website builder - Launch your Memecoin website in seconds using AI! $COINE,AllCryptoBets,1i8drod,2025-01-23 15:55:17,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i8drod/ai_memecoin_website_builder_launch_your_memecoin/,Apart_Philosophy8461,Solana,"Hey fellow trenchmen,

I've been diving deep into the memecon space, and I think I’ve found a real gem that’s still under 200k market cap – $COINE. I wanted to share why I think this project has massive potential and could be a great play moving forward.

 

**Why I’m Bullish on $COINE**

We all know how important first impressions are in the token world. A solid website can make or break a project, and that’s where $COINE comes in. It’s an AI-powered website builder designed specifically for the memecoin space, making it ridiculously easy to create a professional site in seconds. Whether you prefer an automated approach with AI or want to build manually using their intuitive builder using templates, it covers both. Think of it as the Wix of Web3, making token website creation accessible to everyone.

 

**Market Potential**

The memecoin ecosystem is exploding right now. With over 70,000 new tokens being launched daily on [Pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) alone, there’s a huge demand for quick and aesthetically accurate websites for these tokens. If you’ve been watching the space, you’ve probably seen how memecoins have been getting more attention – even from major figures like Trump and other celebrities jumping in. Having an easy way to create a token website is becoming a necessity, and $COINE solves this.

 

**Why I Like $COINE**

**Real Utility:**

\- The $COINE token powers an actual platform with real use – it’s not just hype.

\- AI-driven and super easy to use, making it perfect for both newcomers and experienced devs.

 

 **Fixed Supply & No Inflation:**

\- 1 Billion fixed supply, no minting, no surprises.

 

 **Strong Liquidity & Revenue Model:**

\- Liquidity is burned, meaning stability and security for trading

\- 25% of platform revenue is reinvested into liquidity to keep the ecosystem healthy

 

**Fair Launch & Community Driven:**

\- No presales or special allocations, massive green flag!

\- Community involvement in roadmap decisions, so holders have a REAL say.

 

**What’s ahead of us:**

 

I’ve been in the project for 2 weeks now, and can confiirm dev really delivers on the roadmap! I am very very bullish on what's ahead:

***Phase 1:***

\- Free website builder with premium upgrades using $COINE.

\- A wide choice of pre-defined templates

\- Referral program to earn rewards and commissions.

 

***Phase 2:***

\- AI-driven site creation (this is a game-changer).

\- Integration with platforms like Pumpfun and Moonshot to mint tokens directly.

\- More customization options like widgets and airdrop support.

 

***Phase 3:***

\- To be determined by the community!

 

**Why I Think This Is a Sleeper**

The dev behind this is a legit software developer with years of experience, and he’s been shipping updates like crazy. Coine has REAL UTILITY in a growing market, where they have NO COMPETITION!!! The progress made in such a short time is impressive, and from what I’ve seen in their Telegram and Twitter posts, he's super engaged with the community.

 

**How to join:**

 

If you’re curious and want to see for yourself:

1. Visit the website 

2. Join the Telegram 

3. Contract Address: 3gNjMbdpnLDXNsTPYBA7xvvk6W5NQ8XQyEzkTgZcpump

4. Try building a site: It’s free to start and gives a good feel for what’s possible. You don't even need to sign up to start building.

  
I am very bullish on $COINE and can honestly say i believe this will go to 100M+ in mcap. Do the math for yourself, but also: do your own research!
