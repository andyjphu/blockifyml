Vitalik Buterin Unveils Ethereum‚Äôs Scaling Roadmap For 2025 And Beyond,Blockviews,1i9v1uy,2025-01-25 14:37:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i9v1uy/vitalik_buterin_unveils_ethereums_scaling_roadmap/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Vitalik Buterin Unveils Ethereum‚Äôs Grand Scaling Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond  

Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, just dropped a game-changing blog post outlining the future of the network, and it's packed with ambitious upgrades. The Ethereum roadmap is laser-focused on enhancing scalability, security, and sustainability, all while keeping decentralization intact.  

For Layer 1, sharding takes center stage with Phase 3 upgrades aiming to supercharge Ethereum‚Äôs capacity to process up to 100,000 transactions per second. In addition, Verifiable Delay Functions are set to refine its proof-of-stake consensus, bolstering security like never before.  

Layer 2 solutions aren‚Äôt left out either. Buterin plans to level up Optimistic and ZK-Rollups, creating a flexible off-chain transaction powerhouse. Cross-chain bridges will also make interoperability between Ethereum and other blockchains seamless, empowering broader adoption.  

On the sustainability front, Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake is pegged for completion by mid-2025, aiming to slash the network's energy footprint substantially. This aligns with Ethereum‚Äôs stance on staying eco-conscious while scaling up to serve global demand.  

User experience gets a hefty upgrade as the network rolls out Ethereum 2.5, bringing faster transaction finality and improved wallet interoperability. Developers also get their share of love with EVM 2.0, emerging as a powerful toolkit for building next-gen decentralized applications.  

Long-term, Buterin envisions Ethereum as the backbone of a decentralized, scalable, and sustainable ecosystem that welcomes innovative applications. At the time of writing, $ETH trades at $3,393, reflecting steady anticipation for what lies ahead.

The Risks of Different Staking Methods: A No-Bullshit Guide,DeFiYieldClub,1i9tz75,2025-01-25 13:52:05,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9tz75/the_risks_of_different_staking_methods_a/,Solanafluent,,"Staking is one of the easiest ways to earn passive income in crypto, but not all staking methods are created the same. Some come with good rewards, while others can damage your portfolio if your not careful. Before you lock up your assets, It is important to know what you are getting yourself into. By a request from a community yielder I have tried to break down the risks with different stratetgy.

# 1. Exchange Staking

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) make staking super easy. Just a few clicks and your earning. But easy comes at a cost:

* **Custodial Risk:** Your coins are not  really yours if they are sitting on an exchange. If the exchange gets hacked, mismanages funds, or collapses (FTX, anyone?), you could lose everything.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Governments crack down on exchange staking all the time. One day you are staking, the next day your funds are locked up.
* **Lack of Transparency:** You have no idea what the exchange is doing with your assets behind the scenes.

**Risk Level: High**

# 2. Self-Custody Staking (Validator Delegation)

If you stake directly to a validator on a proof-of-stake (PoS) network like Solana, you keep control of your assets. Sounds great, but there are still some risks:

* **Slashing Risk:** Some networks punish validators for bad behavior or downtime. Solana doesn‚Äôt slash for downtime, but Ethereum does.
* **Validator Risk:** A bad validator means lower rewards or potential delays in unstaking.
* **Liquidity Risk:** Staking locks up your assets for a set period, so if you need funds fast, you might be stuck waiting.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 3. Liquid Staking

Liquid staking protocols (, Lido, Jito, The Vault, Marinade) give you a token that represents your staked assets. You can use this token in DeFi while still earning staking rewards.

* **Smart Contract Risk:** If the protocol gets hacked, you could lose your staked assets.
* **Depeg Risk:** The liquid staking token (mSOL, vSOL) might not always be worth exactly 1:1 with the original asset. But if mSOL or vSOL depeg it would simply be an arbitrage oppertunity as market would buy up the LST and simply unstake it for insta rewards.
* **Centralization Risk:** A few big liquid staking providers controlling the majority of assets can be a concern.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 4. Restaking (Solayer and Similar Protocols)

Restaking lets you take already-staked assets and put them to work securing other networks for extra rewards. More yield? Yes. More risk? Also yes.

* **Smart Contract and Protocol Risks:** These are still new, experimental protocols, meaning more risk.
* **Complexity Risk:** Restaking requires some knowledge and active management. You cant just set it and forget it.

**Risk Level: High**

# 5. Staking via DeFi Lending Platforms

Some lending platforms (Save, Kamino) let you stake assets as collateral to borrow or leverage trade. Higher yield potential, but serious risks:

* **Liquidation Risk:** If your collateral value drops, your position could be wiped out.
* **Interest Rate Fluctuations:** Lending rates shift constantly, meaning your APY could drop fast.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** More complex contracts mean a higher chance of exploits.

**Risk Level: High**

# Final Thoughts

Every staking method has its pros and cons. The best approach? Diversify your staking strategies, use reputable platforms, and never go all-in on one method. Keep an eye on your risk tolerance and make sure you are not locking yourself out of liquidity when you need it most.

Why so bullish on XRP?,CryptoCurrency,1i9ss77,2025-01-25 13:00:08,0,0.42,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i9ss77/why_so_bullish_on_xrp/,HorseGrenade,DISCUSSION,"I‚Äôm bought into XRP at around $3.11. At the moment, I‚Äôm considering it a short position because I expect a decent pump across the market sometime in February/March once retail buyers start to receive their tax returns, and XRP is hotter than hell right now, so it‚Äôs logical that a lot of that liquidity ends up in top performers like XRP.

However‚Ä¶ the broader crypto community is wildly bullish on XRP, with a lot of opinions indicating long term viability. I‚Äôve seen more than a few people float the idea of it going to $10, which would put it above Ethereum‚Äôs long held #2 spot in terms of market cap. That seems‚Ä¶ not impossible with how ETH has been performing, but still very lofty for a coin that has spent the last several years under $1.

I plan to look up and read the white paper on it later today, but I‚Äôm curious what makes people so bullish on XRP aside from successful gains already gotten. Is there a technical aspect that gives it broader use value than something like Ethereum? Perhaps some deeper technical value in combination with qualities of its open source community? Or does a lot of it boil down to ‚ÄúI like the coin‚Äù? I‚Äôm curious what you all like about it!"

Their approach integrates the LN with the Fiber Network to create a Hybrid Network, introducing stablecoins, automated liquidity management, and zero-cost channel opening.

Key features include:

1. **Decentralized Liquidity Staking Pool (DLSP):** Improves liquidity efficiency by enabling liquid staking derivatives and automated management.
2. **Hybrid Network:** Integrates LN with Fiber Network for stablecoin support and better connectivity, so you can pay with bitcoin and merchant receives USD stablecoin
3. **Zero-Cost Onboarding:** Simplifies LN adoption by advancing funds for channel setup.

They also propose use cases like decentralized swaps, AI agent payments, and composability with DeFi. The project aims to create a scalable, user-friendly payment system aligned with Web5 principles.

What do you think about this solution? Can it truly address LN's challenges and drive mass adoption?

End-to-end decentralized web hosting with MASSA's DeWeb,CryptoCurrency,1i9qjs9,2025-01-25 11:23:08,4,0.67,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i9qjs9/endtoend_decentralized_web_hosting_with_massas/,GraouMaou,TECHNOLOGY,"To change a bit from the doom and gloom of ETH holders, price speculation, presidential memecoins, and others, I wanted to write a short post about a new innovation regarding subjects central to crypto/web3: **decentralization** and **censorship resistance**. More specifically, I want to introduce you to the recent ""DeWeb"" from Massa with a short guide.

## What is Massa?

- [Massa](https://massa.net/) is a relatively new PoS L1 blockchain (mainnet launched ~1 year ago) that pioneered a parallel block processing architecture called ""blockclique"", allowing to process up to 10,000 transactions per second while maintaining decentralization. 
- As decentralization is one of the core value propositions of MASSA, running a node a staking is both easy and accessible, requiring only minimal specs (8 cores, 16 GB RAM, 1TB disk and a decent internet connection) and 100 MAS (less than 10$). Currently over 1,200 node operators are staking MASSA.
- The [Massa ecosystem](https://massa.foundation/ecosystem) is rapidly developing, already featuring a bridge from Ethereum, a [DEX](https://app.dusa.io/), NFT marketplace, memecoins, games, and more. 

Massa now pushes decentralization further by working to **decentralize the web itself**. On January 15th, they launched a platform called DeWeb, allowing to deploy fully decentralized websites.


## End-to-end decentralized websites and applications

DeWeb is a decentralized hosting solution that allows developers to build and host their websites and dApps directly on-chain, eliminating risks associated with centralized servers. Unlike centralized hosting where server failures can make sites inaccessible, DeWeb ensures site availability by replicating data across each Massa network node, eliminating single points of failure. Additionally, DeWeb-hosted sites can be made immutable, preventing unauthorized modifications or hacking attempts.

### What is the point? 

An attacker could include malicious code in an app's frontend to compromise user's wallets, promote scams, ...  A recent example is [the hack of Lego's official website](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/legos-website-hacked-to-push-cryptocurrency-scam/) to promote a fake cryptocurrency called LegoCoin. The attackers modified the homepage and inserted fraudulent links, redirecting visitors to pages promoting this crypto scam. If the site had been hosted on DeWeb, its immutable content would have prevented such fraudulent modifications and redirections.

Even in the web3/crypto world, current dApps still rely extensively on Web2 infrastructure, including dependence on centralized servers for hosting their websites. This defeats the purpose of running on a decentralized blockchain in the first place, and makes these apps vulnerable.


### Getting started with DeWeb

Multiple tools are already available to explore DeWeb and host your own websites:

- Search engine: a Google-style search bar for exploring DeWeb-hosted sites
- Massa features a [naming service](https://mns.massa.net/), providing human-readable domain names for easy access to decentralized websites.
- Easy uploader: an interface allows you to upload websites easily, by dragging-and-dropping ZIP files

## Future plans 

Looking ahead, the team announces plans to integrate with various popular CMS tools, allowing website decentralization from scratch -- another step towards true decentralization."

The Next Big Thing: REAL Competitive Trading - $RED vs $BLUE,Moonshotcoins,1i9o8xg,2025-01-25 09:37:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moonshotcoins/comments/1i9o8xg/the_next_big_thing_real_competitive_trading_red/,ILikeWeirdHumans,,"Memecoin cults are all the rage on Crypto Twitter right now. But why settle for just one when you can have two?

## The Basics

- **Two Tokens:** Choose your favorite‚Äî$RED or $BLUE. When the supply of your token hits zero, your side takes the victory and the rewards!
- **Dynamic HP System:** Each token starts with 10B HP (its supply), which can increase to 21B. Every purchase chips away at your rival‚Äôs HP while boosting your own.
- **GameMaster in Control:** A smart contract handles it all autonomously‚Äîdynamic pricing, ETH redistribution, and price updates based on Uniswap pools for extra strategy.

## What‚Äôs in It for You?

- **Community-Driven Rewards:** 70% of every purchase fuels the final reward pool, which returns to the community (unlike other projects who take 80% for themselves üëÄ).
- **Winner Takes All:** If your token wins, you get a share of the reward pool based on how much you hold. Own 1% of the supply? You‚Äôll take 1% of the prize pool.
- **No Shady Business:** Liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced, and there are no insider wallets or token allocation. 

## More Green Flags?

- Total transparency. No rugs. Ownership renounced for ultimate peace of mind. If you any questions, I'll answer personally.
- Zero trading fees, just a 5% dev fee on GameMaster buys.
- This isn‚Äôt just another memecoin; it‚Äôs a tactical war where timing and strategy count.

I Think Cryptos Can Be Evaluated By An Idea From Stock Evaluation Methods.,CryptoMarkets,1i9mhi0,2025-01-25 08:02:42,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i9mhi0/i_think_cryptos_can_be_evaluated_by_an_idea_from/,PureClass247,,"Today, I'll focus on only 3 cryptos: 

ETH (Ethereum), 

SOL (Solana),

TRX (Tron). 

These are representative cryptos of L1 (Layer 1) chains.

Actually, I've been thinking about crypto evaluation methods during the past 7 years. 4 years ago, I tried to evaluate cryptos by Marketcap divided by TVL (Total Value Locked). If the figure is lower than other chains, relatively, it can be undervalued.

As time goes by, we can check 24h tx (Transactions) fees data from De-Fi platforms such as swap pools or DEX (Decentralized Exchange, looks like a traditional CEX - Centralized Exchange).

Alright! Let's try to calculate annualized tx fees from 3 major coins.

(Estimates)

üëâ ETH annual tx fees: $4.57m √ó 365 (days) = $1.6b

Excluding L2 chains, like BASE

üëâ SOL annual tx fees: $15.5m √ó 365 (days) = $5.7b

üëâ TRX annual tx fees: $1.93m √ó 365 (days) = $0.7b

üëâ ETH marketcap: $397b

üëâ SOL marketcap: $121b

üëâ TRX marketcap: $22b

Let's take an idea from PER, so how many years does it take from Marketcap divided by Annual tx fees?

Marketcap / Annual tx fee

üëâ ETH = $397b √∑ $1.6b = 248y (Years)

üëâ SOL = $121b √∑ $5.7b = 21y

üëâ TRX = $22b √∑ $0.7b = 31y

Of course, please consider this data is excluding ETH L2 chains.

Anyways, in conclusion, SOL is the king of altcoins as L1 chains, and TRX is undervalued, considering TRX marketcap.

Alright, let's advance TVL evaluation methods. Now we have Bridged TVL data. Bridged TVL means an original chain's assets TVL + other chains' tokens TVL.

So, if a chain has high bridged TVL, compared to marketcap, the chain can be undervalued. I think this evaluation model is more advanced than the previous model. Cause, high bridged TVL means since many investors trust a blockchain, they used the bridging function a lot.

Let's calculate liquidation value by Marketcap / Bridged TVL.

üëâ ETH = $397b √∑ $229.764b = 1.73

üëâ SOL = $121b √∑ $46.921b = 2.58

üëâ TRX = $22b √∑ $66.185b = 0.33

It seems bridging users trust Tron chain more than other chains ü§î Interesting üßê Rich bridging users prefer using Ethereum and Tron.

So, my conclusion is.. SOL is the leader of all altcoins now, and it's still undervalued in terms of 24h tx fees. However, rich users prefer using Ethereum and Tron. Furthermore, TRX is still potential to grow more with respect to these data. Let's keep our eyes on these 3 major coins ü§î

The Ultimate Guide to Staking: Earn Passive Income with Crypto,DeFiYieldClub,1i9l35j,2025-01-25 06:32:43,6,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9l35j/the_ultimate_guide_to_staking_earn_passive_income/,Solanafluent,,"# 1. Introduction to Staking

# What is Staking?

Staking is a way to earn rewards on your crypto by locking it up to help secure a blockchain network. Instead of just holding your tokens, staking lets you put them to work and earn passive income. It‚Äôs like earning interest in a savings account, but for crypto.

# Proof of Stake (PoS) vs. Proof of Work (PoW)

* **PoW (Proof of Work)**: Used by Bitcoin, miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This requires a lot of computing power and energy.
* **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Instead of miners, validators are chosen based on how much crypto they stake. This method is more energy-efficient and allows for faster transactions.

# 2. Benefits of Staking

# Earn Passive Income

By staking, you receive rewards in the form of more crypto. For example, if you stake 100 SOL with a 8% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), you will earn 8 SOL over a year.

# Support Network Security

Stakers help validate transactions and prevent attacks. The more users staking, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes.

# Eco-Friendly Alternative to Mining

Unlike PoW mining, staking does not require large amounts of energy, making it a more sustainable way to support blockchain networks.

# 3. Types of Staking

# Direct Staking

* You lock up your assets directly on a blockchain.
* Requires technical knowledge.
* You are responsible for managing your stake.

# Delegated Staking

* You delegate your tokens to a trusted validator who stakes them for you.
* Easier for beginners.
* Validators take a small commission from your rewards.

# Liquid Staking

* You stake your assets but receive a liquid staking token (LST) like vSOL, mSOL, or JitoSOL, which can be used in DeFi.
* Allows you to stay liquid and use your staked funds for lending, farming, or other yield strategies.
* Higher rewards potential but involves smart contract risks.

# 4. How to Get Started with Staking

# Choosing the Right Crypto for Staking

* Popular staking tokens include **SOL (Solana), ETH (Ethereum), ADA (Cardano), and DOT (Polkadot).**
* Consider factors like staking yield, lock-up periods, and project credibility.

# Selecting a Wallet and Platform

* Use secure wallets like **Phantom, Ledger, or Solflare**.
* Choose a staking platform that offers transparency and security, such as **Marinade, Lido, Jito, or The Vault**.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Staking

1. **Choose a Wallet**: Set up a non-custodial wallet (etc Phantom for Solana or MetaMask for Ethereum).
2. **Select a Staking Provider**: Decide whether to stake directly with the network or through a third-party staking service.
3. **Stake Your Tokens**: Follow the platforms instructions to delegate your tokens.
4. **Track Your Rewards**: Use blockchain explorers or staking dashboards to track earnings.

[How to Stake SOL](https://reddit.com/link/1i9l35j/video/tjh4hvu1k4fe1/player)

# 5. Risks and Considerations

**Slashing Risks**

Some blockchains will put penalties if validators act corrupt or fail to validate transactions properly. Choosing a strong validator minimizes this risk.

# Lock-Up Periods

* Some networks require a **cooldown period** before you can unstake your tokens. Avoid CEX ( central exchanges at all costs) Coinbase even take a 35% cut from your rewards. That's insane.
* Liquid staking removes this issue but carries its own risks.

# Market Volatility

* Crypto prices goes up or down, so while you earn staking rewards, your staked assets value may decrease.
* Diversifying assets and strategies can help mitigate losses.

# 6. Advanced Staking Strategies

# Yield Farming with Liquid Staking

* Liquid staking tokens (vSOL, mSOL) can be used in **liquidity pools, lending platforms, or farming strategies** to earn extra rewards on top of staking yields. ( even more crypto)

# Restaking for Extra Rewards

* Some protocols allow **restaking**, where you use your liquid staking rewards to earn even more yield in different DeFi platforms.

# Diversification Strategy

* Split your stake across different validators to reduce risk and increase chances of better APY returns.

# Successful Staking Projects

* **Lido (ETH Staking)**: One of the largest staking platforms with liquid staking.
* **Marinade (SOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking.
* **The Vault (vSOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking focusing on community.

# 8. Future of Staking

# Emerging Trends

* **Increased Institutional Adoption**: More funds and enterprises staking crypto for yield.
* **Enhanced DeFi Integrations**: Liquid staking becoming central to yield strategies.

# Regulatory Considerations

* Some countries are **taxing staking rewards as income**, while others see them as capital gains.
* Decentralized staking may face **future regulatory review,** staying informed is key.

# Final Thoughts

Staking is one of the best ways to earn passive income in crypto while supporting network security. Whether you go for **direct staking, delegated staking, or liquid staking**, each method has its pros and cons. The key is to choose a strategy that fits your risk tolerance and investment goals.

3. I can use these stAPTs on other platforms, like Echelon or Meso, and by lending them I receive some APTs as rewards
4. When I am done, I withdraw my stAPTs (and APTs rewards) from the lending platform,
5. I unstake my stAPTs from Amnis receiving back amAPTs
6. Eventually I withdraw amAPTs and I receive APTs 1:1 after 14 days

# ABOUT NOVANEED:

NovaNeed is one of the first e-commerce platforms made *by crypto users, for crypto users.* Powered by the Solana blockchain, NovaNeed lets you **cheaply and easily** buy and sell real-world goods with cryptocurrency.

**Our fees are LOW at 2%! While our competitors' fees are at \~10%(!!!!) Our fees are far, far lower than our competitors due to the hyper-low latency of the Solana blockchain. Our fees are much lower than if we were to use traditional payment processors or slower blockchains.**¬†

# How we do it:

To achieve the expected results on Solana, we use compressed NFTs to cheaply list items on the blockchain, which allows for us to charge the LOW fee of 2%! Not only that, but if you bought a really cool item you love, you can record yourself giving a review, and if it‚Äôs received well by the community, you‚Äôll earn **NovaNeed Tokens ($NOVA)** from the liquidity pool

# Item Standardization:

We also offer standardization of items to allow for production efficiency, market efficiency, and consumer confidence. Many items can be standardized and homogenized then put on a singular line to be traded, helping defeat informational barriers between platforms and brands.¬†

Utilizing flat rate shipping options alongside these standardized products allows for individuals across the country to have the similar experiences when purchasing the same goods. This can be currently observed within the pharmaceutical industry, where generic items are sold to consumers at lower costs and are easily mass produced. The toaster market is also an example of this.¬†

# Users get rewarded:

As mentioned previously, an innovative feature of NovaNeed is the ability for users to record review videos and have others vote on the reliability of the video to receive rewards.¬†

On top of that, it‚Äôs required for both sell and buy side users to come up with a common description for each item, allowing for the democratization of item information, increasing accuracy and lowering bias.

# Additional Features:

* **Cashback rewards** for transactions,
* **Live, secure physical item trading with live price tracking**
* And a cutting-edge **AI assistant** that lists your item with just a photo.

# In Conclusion:

If you own $NOVA, in the coming weeks you can access our marketplace early!

This error appears every minute. Usually it does not disrupt the chain being updated, but occasionally (once a day, or every few days) the error seems to create a pile-up, and prevents any further updates until I manually restart the Geth and Teku DApps.

I'm running Geth Execution Client (10.0.68), ETH Staking MEV-Boost (0.0.13), Teku Consensus Client (0.0.56), and the ETH Withdrawal address too (0.0.5)

Ethereum Taps Wall Street Veteran Vivek Raman to Drive Institutional Push,bitfate,1i9bxtk,2025-01-24 20:38:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i9bxtk/ethereum_taps_wall_street_veteran_vivek_raman_to/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Etherealize Revolutionizes Ethereum's Wall Street Integration

In a move that could significantly alter the crypto landscape, Etherealize, backed by Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, has set its sights on making Ethereum the go-to blockchain for Wall Street. This innovative startup, led by Wall Street veteran Vivek Raman, is on a mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology.

Etherealize kicked off its operations in New York with a small but dedicated team, aiming to develop ETH-linked financial products such as derivatives and Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). These instruments are designed to attract institutional investors by offering new avenues for exposure to Ethereum, potentially boosting liquidity and mainstream acceptance of ETH.

The venture's ambition is clear: to make ETH a fundamental part of the financial system of tomorrow. With the backing of Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, Etherealize is poised to advance Ethereum's role in conventional financial markets. This integration could lead to steadier prices, better market access, and increased demand for ETH, making it a more appealing asset for institutional investors.

However, Etherealize will face several challenges, including navigating the complex regulatory landscape and competing with established firms that already offer crypto-linked financial products. To succeed, Etherealize must set itself apart by providing unique solutions tailored to institutional needs and educating traditional financial institutions about the advantages of blockchain technology.

If Etherealize achieves its goals, it could drive Ethereum's global adoption, transforming the landscape of traditional finance and solidifying Ethereum's status as a leader in blockchain innovation.

- I currently have 1500$ that I can invest and lose so should I do it now, divided into weeks or wait till the next low?

- is there some kind of liquidity pools or so? Since I plan to hold it for a long term can I stake it or so to get a APY.

By fostering trust among its community, PepeArab lays the foundation for long-term success, encouraging both seasoned investors and newcomers to participate confidently in its ecosystem.

---

#### Sharing Profits with $PEPEARAB Holders

PepeArab introduces an innovative profit-sharing model that benefits all $PEPEARAB token holders. Profits generated from the PepeArab meme-focused exchange are indirectly shared with token holders, creating an additional incentive to invest. This mechanism aligns the success of the platform with its community, ensuring that everyone has a stake in its growth.

The profit-sharing model highlights PepeArab‚Äôs commitment to community-driven growth, making it more than just another memecoin project. By combining innovation with financial incentives, PepeArab positions itself as a trailblazer in the crypto market.

---

#### Arab NFTs: Unique and Rewarding Features

As part of its ecosystem, PepeArab launches an exclusive NFT collection called ‚ÄúArab NFTs.‚Äù These digital collectibles come with unique and rewarding features and are available only to presale contributors. After the token launch, Arab NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded directly on PepeArab.com or other major NFT marketplaces like Opensea.

These NFTs not only offer aesthetic value but also serve as a key component of the PepeArab ecosystem. They enable holders to unlock special features and benefits, further incentivizing early adoption and long-term participation.

The introduction of Arab NFTs reflects PepeArab‚Äôs innovative approach to blending memecoins with the thriving NFT market, creating a multifaceted ecosystem that appeals to a diverse audience.

---

#### A Complete Ecosystem for Memecoins

PepeArab.com aims to be more than just a marketplace; it strives to build a comprehensive ecosystem where all popular memecoins are represented. By creating a dedicated platform for memecoins, PepeArab provides a unique space for users to discover, trade, and engage with their favorite assets.

The platform also looks to introduce innovative features that go beyond traditional exchanges. By integrating advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), PepeArab ensures an unparalleled user experience. From personalized recommendations to intuitive interfaces, AI enhances every aspect of the platform, making it user-friendly and efficient.

---

#### Accelerating Innovation in the Crypto Space

PepeArab‚Äôs vision extends beyond memecoins and NFTs. By continuously innovating and adapting to market trends, the project aims to set new standards for the crypto industry. The combination of a meme-focused exchange, profit-sharing mechanisms, and AI-driven user experiences makes PepeArab a unique player in the market.

With its unique Arab NFTs, profit-sharing model, and focus on AI-powered user experiences, PepeArab is well-positioned to become a major force in the world of memecoins and crypto adoption.

I have the staking settings for ""Automatic earning"" unchecked, and it's been unchecked since I first started unstaking.  however, every new staking reward keeps getting re-staked automatically, despite that setting, which forces me to unstake the new rewards and rinse and repeat. at some point, given enough time, there won't be any more rewards due to the small balance, but this is extremely frustrating because it takes sooo long to unstake (especially for eth) and I don't want left with any dust that just sits there.

Am I making a mistake selling my house and consolidating investments for a ‚Äúforever‚Äù home?,personalfinance,1i98tfg,2025-01-24 18:09:13,0,0.31,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1i98tfg/am_i_making_a_mistake_selling_my_house_and/,WardellCurry30,Housing,"Am I making a mistake?

TLDR; Wife and I got very fortunate and were able to buy a home right when COVID hit at a favorable interest rate (3.125%), we fell in love with a new home and are considering consolidating most of our savings to upgrade. 

Hi everyone!! Long time lurker first time poster. My wife and I (27M/F) are about to make a significant decision that I‚Äôm comfortable with, but have a weird feeling is a big mistake, looking for some outside perspective.

We live in a very HCOL area and have had multiple strokes of good fortune. We were able to buy a starter townhouse at 3.125% in 2020 that has appreciated by ~300k, and due to some savvy (lucky lol) crypto investments we have a very healthy nest egg invested in retirement, traditional investments, and some crypto.

We‚Äôre expecting our first child and have been passively keeping an eye on the market for an upgrade and somewhere we could plant roots/settle for the long term. We‚Äôve recently fallen in love and are planning on putting in an offer this weekend. 

To be competitive, we‚Äôd have to sell our house and liquidate effectively all of our available investments (~200k in the market, 100k in ETH), as well as sell our current house. We still have ~125k in retirement accounts and a 529 that‚Äôs being funded. We‚Äôre blessed with well paying jobs we‚Äôve been successful in, so I‚Äôm comfortable with the payment and slowly building back up our nest egg, and I‚Äôm already aware of the fact that we‚Äôd be giving up a low interest rate which stings, but am I missing something significant other than having less diversification in the short term and a higher interest rate overall?? 

Any feedback would be appreciated! "

The team behind Nervos Network (CKB) has proposed UTXO Stack, a decentralized liquidity staking layer to tackle the limitations of the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), such as liquidity issues, onboarding barriers, and the lack of stablecoin support. Their approach integrates the LN with the Fiber Network to create a Hybrid Network, introducing stablecoins, automated liquidity management, and zero-cost channel opening.

Key features include:

1. **Decentralized Liquidity Staking Pool (DLSP):** Improves liquidity efficiency by enabling liquid staking derivatives and automated management.
2. **Hybrid Network:** Integrates LN with Fiber Network for stablecoin support and better connectivity, so you can pay with bitcoin and merchant receives USD stablecoin
3. **Zero-Cost Onboarding:** Simplifies LN adoption by advancing funds for channel setup.

They also propose use cases like decentralized swaps, AI agent payments, and composability with DeFi. The project aims to create a scalable, user-friendly payment system aligned with Web5 principles.

What do you think about this solution? Can it truly address LN's challenges and drive mass adoption?

The largest on-chain sports betting app now has gasless bridge with Polygon,polygonnetwork,1i94vn3,2025-01-24 15:17:43,14,0.94,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/polygonnetwork/comments/1i94vn3/the_largest_onchain_sports_betting_app_now_has/,ballsjumpman,,"[News](https://www.reddit.com/r/BASE/?f=flair_name%3A%22News%22)

Noticed that SX Bet (on-chain sports betting platform doing around $20m in monthly bets) has added a new bridging solution called Glide that offers gasless bridging between SX Network and Polygon. SX Network is SX Bet‚Äôs L2 Rollup. It‚Äôs a pretty sweet integration, essentially allows users to:

* Bridge a wide selection of different tokens on Polygon (as well as ETH, Arb, base, and OP) and receive equivalent USDC on SX Network, gas-free and no fees, instantly
* Withdraw USDC on SX Network back to Polygon instantly, to any destination address. Super low fees.

Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre a sports bettor. IMO this new integration puts their on/off ramp UX at minimum on par with, if not superior to Rollbit/Stake. Especially so when you consider that it's non-custodial, so you‚Äôre able to transact and deposit or withdraw as you please without fear of funds being held.

I‚Äôve been a user of decentralized betting apps for the self-custody, transparency and better odds aspects for a while now, but the UX historically was a bit cumbersome if you‚Äôre weren't accustomed to web3. This should make it exponentially easier for anyone to use.

I saw SX Bet now has an on-ramp integration to fund your wallet with USDC on SX Network (SX Bet‚Äôs L2 Rollup) directly from your Coinbase account (through Glide). SX is the largest decentralized sports betting platform, handling around $20m/month in bets. Mainly known for its super tight lines and great odds.

If you have some USD or ETH in your Coinbase account, you can connect to it and fund your hot wallet with USDC on SX Network to start betting right away. No need to go through the tiresome process of making sure you're sending to the right address, correct token, on the correct network etc.

You can also withdraw straight to your Coinbase account on Base (with a minuscule fee, but no gas funds needed). 

Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre a sports bettor. IMO this new integration makes their on/off ramp UX at minimum on par with if not superior to Rollbit/Stake.

1. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that pay tribute to memes, celebrities, animals and viral internet trends.
2. Successful memecoin trading requires thorough research to avoid scams, careful evaluation of community strength and liquidity factors, and adherence to best practices for risk management.
3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins üíª

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke.¬†

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars‚Äô worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they‚Äôre highly volatile ‚Äî even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them.¬†

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins üìç

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like¬†[Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge),¬†[Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe)¬†do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like¬†[Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/)¬†and¬†[Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as¬†[Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

# Key considerations for memecoin trading üßê

As with any investment,¬†[doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor)¬†is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that¬†**memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers ‚Äî taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it‚Äôs easy for bad actors to ‚Äòastroturf‚Äô on social media ‚Äî making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you‚Äôll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength.¬†

An example of a potential red flag is an¬†[LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens)¬†that hasn‚Äôt been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide,¬†[How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like¬†[Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/)¬†or¬†[Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/)¬†can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:**¬†a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:**¬†take a look at the project‚Äôs Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:**¬†as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn‚Äôt, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:**¬†can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading üìö

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders.¬†

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable.¬†

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading üìñ

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that¬†**the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space ‚Äî ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

BTC price update. Lots of short entries after yesterday.,Follow_Smartmoney,1i8z8tn,2025-01-24 11:23:02,3,0.81,8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8z8tn,lowriskhighvalue,,"Short time frame shows a lot of short interest came in last evening driving the price upwards. Long time frames show a larger downward liquidity pool.

As the price is around 105-106k, but it seems ro very stuck there as market makers are constantly selling there. I guess people have figured out that area is a large resistance and parked all their shorts on top of it.

I think if there are more shorts coming in, we could see a fast upward movement towards 107500. But after expect a pretty fast drop. The support is pretty thin right now to 100k and if they wanted to go there they can probably easily achieve it.

Its pretty crazy how fast peoples psychology changes. Just 24 hours ago people went euphoric and got caught on the wrong side of the trade and now it looks like they will get trapped again.

ETH has diverged from  BTC in some ways and i believe its going to be stuck around the 3100-3400 area till BTC corrects.

ATH seems impossible right now with that huge sell wall on 110k, It hasn‚Äôt moved a bit even with all the buying pressure yesterday and there isnt enough liquidity to drive the price higher. Its a very similar situation as the one we had before BTC hit 100k.

I think we re playing out the same kind of price action as back then around 100k.

I'm No Longer With Blocks United,cosmosnetwork,1i8yx9a,2025-01-24 11:09:29,62,0.98,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1i8yx9a/im_no_longer_with_blocks_united/,AtlasStaking,,"I (Matt) am one of the founders of Blocks United and have been keeping track of airdrops for you for several years. I have split my time between Blocks United and Atlas Staking for quite awhile. After 3 great years, I've decided to move on from Blocks United and to focus on growing validators with Atlas Staking. 

I am an airdrop hunter myself, so I will continue to post valuable updates. I don't want you to miss big free money... airdrops like Injective and Celestia that made people thousands of dollars. 

Atlas Staking is worth keeping an eye on because we are expanding rapidly. We currently run validators for Cosmos (inactive), Kava, Nomic, Band, Babylon, Stride, Seda, ETH/Stader, Radix, Avalanche, Avail, and Polygon. If you stake any of those tokens, please give Atlas Staking your consideration.

Onward and upward. Peace!"
