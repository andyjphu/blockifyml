creepy or just lonely doordash driver??,doordash,1i9xf9j,2025-01-25 16:22:55,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1i9xf9j/creepy_or_just_lonely_doordash_driver/,DistanceTank,,"     Had my food delivered to me and 20 minutes later i find a note taped to my door. It was from the door dash driver - he left his phone number for me to contact him.

Context:

      Me and my younger sister use doordash all the time for food. The delivery guy tells us he would be at our place in a few ( via the text feature on the app ) and we replied with a short thank you.
     We check back and come back to PARAGRAPHS of this guy venting about his life and how he has nobody to talk to and it‚Äôs honestly insane. Out of pity we give a ‚Äúoh sorry about that‚Äù and move on, not expecting much. We open the app again to MORE paragraphs and him leaving his number for us, but we just didn‚Äôt reply. We thought the whole thing would blow over.

      DoorDash had closed the convo as it usually does. That‚Äôs when the note was found ( after our food was delivered )


Honestly don‚Äôt know what to do, the guy has already seen me and i very obviously look like an 18 year old girl. Weird that he would still try to give his number out a second time after that üò≠???"

Valencia Year 2,RimWorld,1i9xccj,2025-01-25 16:19:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/1i9xccj/valencia_year_2/,SuperTaster3,Colony Showcase,"https://preview.redd.it/bylgiau5e7fe1.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f64a9af5230ff1e451115cf39250702a543e6a

Valencia continues to grow! A 'pirate' enclave lead by Diana, a lady who insists she is a pirate because she has a pirate hat. A castle built on a semi-island in an oxbow river, with an anima tree on an actual island, and now spreading out to a few other regions.

The rainbow tower probably needs renovating. I tried for a sort of spiral shape, but I think the circle is just too small to do that. It would probably look better if Green's top wall was brought up flush with Red's. Right now, Red is Research, Orange is Tailoring, Yellow is Crafting/Fabrication, Green is Dining, Blue is unused, Purple is a landing spot for items, and Pink is a royal bedroom for Diana and Strange. The tower curves counterclockwise, and pink can only be reached by going around the spiral. The grey Destruction area heads out back to a geothermal and corpse zones.

[Spinnin!](https://preview.redd.it/oxo74ynue7fe1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=448d40372090bbef0eeb39f81562bc2bd6d24bd3)

The grotto up north was an Area Revealed!, and it seemed like a reasonable place to put apartments. Dunno what to do with the sand pit in the middle though, but clearly it needs to become Something recreational. Colonists don't quite seem to have a grasp of the skipgates: They'll deliver through them, but when tasked with bringing something back they'll walk the long way. Half victories, I suppose.

[This is your hole! It was made for you.](https://preview.redd.it/8hqsi8n7f7fe1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f62107172f778907a7fe9654e5f13568b2dc1d1)

Randy has been an **absolute Buttface** this year. Not just a toxic spewer, but toxic fallout afterwords that brought us down to 0 food and about 100 meals before production caught back up. About 5 raids back to back. Right as the rainbow tower went online, a herd of 33 bunny people charged in(sappers) insisting that they be allowed to play in the tower too, with their guns. The plan for devilstrand dusters to stave off the desert heat has not happened because all the plants died. The perils of having a sunroof courtyard garden.

This will become less of a problem as turrets come online, but still. Very rude. I think I've hit the maximum size I want for the colony at least: 21 adults/2 children. Ahoy has a sad bug where because he is a faun, he faints constantly at the sight of the cleaning robots. Hopefully that will get patched soon, because it's really dumb.

9 Psycasters, filling out the general needs. Calliope the giant spider girl(Anti Material Rifle because she's big) is slowly learning how to upgrade gear psychically. Starlight has put in skipgates around the colony, and only needs a few more levels to get the sixth and final one online. Argo continues to be a dominant sparklord despite her noncombat(mutagun) weapon. She sends the lightning, and then 'heals' the raiders at the end into 100% hp animals. A win for everyone, really.

12 Ranged, 6 Melee, 1 Mutagun, 2 Pacifist. Every colonist has their own specific weapon type, which I try to keep on them but they keep dropping their stuff when they fall over in raids. Current winner in combat is Diana, with two revolvers and a levitation implant that let her just kinda slide around the battlefield going ""pew pew pew"". Izzy has a minigun, and took the idea of an animal going manhunter with a giggle and about 20 bullets in the poor crab's direction. In general the colony is very offense oriented; armor is not as cool as having fancy weapons that they're highly skilled with. Slowly working up to proper defenses though.

I do wish pacifists could equip Thrumbo Plushies. It would be thematic and adorable.

Animals are ramping up to be Mostly Thrumbos. They're about 1/3 of the crowd, but they eat SO much that they might as well be all of them. Some camels, some buffalo, a goat named Crispin, and then various white/silver/crimson thrumbos. They have lots of trees to eat, and enjoy letting the kiddos ride on them. Notable names: Cameleon, Camelot, Mobile Sofa(buffalo), Silvant, Thrumpet, Crimbo, Thrumbone, Mrs. Potato Head(capybara),

Next goals are to get proper turrets up so that the colonists aren't running around putting out fires. Let the shore defend itself while they work on building neat buildings. Some sort of goober cathedral in the upper mountain, walls on the T bridge to make it more of a real structure, and a field hospital rather than the pseudo one we have now.

Feel free to spew thoughts and give suggestions on what can be built next. There's a lot of the map left to conquer!"

Ines 101,TheFirstDescendant,1i9xabz,2025-01-25 16:16:51,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1i9xabz/ines_101/,VeeGeeTea,Build / Guide,"After countless hours of trial and errors, I've narrowed down to two builds that would be beneficial for you. This isn't an absolute MUST DO, and you're also free to modify to your play style.

Ines is a crit type character, by default her crit rate is high enough that it will trigger crit damage whenever you use one of her skills, however, you can also increase the crit rate to boost her damage multiplier from her passive skill perks.

The weapons of choice would be Secret Garden, as it buffs your Tech skill whenever you use it.  
EXCAVA is swapped, while you're waiting for your skills to recharge or you ran out of MP in the long run.  
Voltia is a required for many Void missions, it's the best blue/yellow shield buster weapon in the game.

Ines has one offensive red mod (Hunting Hounds) and one defensive red mod (Plasma Ball)

The first of which is for **\[Time of the Hunting Hounds\]** build, this is aimed to be a rapid fire with cooldown, banking on Ines passive perks:  
  
**\[Reactor\]**  
*Tech Mechanic Reactor*  
\+Tech  
\+Tactical | Automatic | Beam (Implant these three for all purpose play)  
\+Cooldown  
\+Cost

You can opt for +Tech and +Crit Dmg instead for the golden perks, instead of the above, should you need additional damage.

**\[Components\]**  
Farm for the *Hunter Set*, at two pieces, you'll get -4% Cooldown, and at four pieces, you'll get additional +0.12 MP Recovery (Combat), +1.03 MP Recovery (Non-Combat). Since Ines can generate MP at a chance when using her skills, this is a great component to have that would complement her.

*Hunter Auxiliary Power*  
Default: Max Shield  
Max HP  
MP Recovery Out of Combat or DBNO (Increase Timeout timer for when you're down)

*Hunter Sensor*  
Default: DEF (Damage Reduction)  
Max MP  
MP Recovery In Combat

*Hunter Memory*  
Default: Max Shield  
DEF (Damage Reduction)  
MP Recovery Modifier (Increase the MP multiplier)

*Hunter Processor*  
Default: Max HP  
Max Shield  
Shield Recovery Modifier or Toxic Resistance (look for this only if you need it vs Colossus)

Below are your character mods for the Hunter build:

**\[Descendant\]**  
*Time of the Hunting Hounds*  
This mod will turn all your skills to use Tech, and your 3rd skill will do 100m dash instead of shock punch.  
This is also good when you're using a Tech reactor, as it will benefit not only 2 but all your skills.

**\[Sub Attack\]**  
*Mid-Air Maneuvering*  
This is a personal choice, to get yourself out of sticky situation without the need of a platform or wall to grapple to.

**\[Cooldown\]**  
*Nimble Fingers* (-25.6% Cooldown)  
Her skills recharges fast enough as is, you don't need any more than this amount.  
Spamming 1st skill more than 3x won't do additional damage, as you'll need to allow time for her to play Ping-Pong with the target first.

**\[Crit\]**  
*Front Lines* (+64.6% Crit Dmg, +27.7% Crit Rate)  
*Emergency Measures* (+64.6% Crit Rate, +27.7% Crit Dmg)  
*Skill Concentration* (+115.4% Crit Dmg)  
The Crit Rate will boost her passive multiplier, the damage will increase the final crit value.

**\[Range\]**  
*Skill Expansion* (+92.3% Range)  
You don't need any more than this, the circle is already big enough with this mod.

**\[HP\]**  
*HP Amplification* (+227.2% HP, -36.5% Shield)  
*Increased HP* (+218.5% HP)  
You don't need that much shield, main thing is HP to stay alive, especially during Abyss boss fight where you're required to move around often and avoid poison.

**\[Skill\]**  
*Tech Specialist* (+76.1% Tech Power)  
*Electric Specialist* (+81.2% Electric Power)  
Remember when we've converted all her skills to Tech? This is now beneficial when using these mods. All her skills will now get the same power boost.

**\[Golden Ticket\]**  
*Dangerous Ambush* (+24.9% Skill Power When not targeted, +49.8% Skill Power vs immobilized)  
*Hyperfocus* (+12.4% Firearm Crit Dmg when Skill Crit Hit, +10.1% Skill Crit Dmg when Firearm Crit Hit)  
*Leathal Infection* (+2.5% to +25% SPM when Firearm Crit Hit)  
*Multitalented* (+15% Range and SPM when skill use)  
*Technical Manual* (+46% Skill Damage from self HP value)  
*Decimator* (+5% to +50% SPM, for each debuff enemies defeated)  
Personally, I would prefer Dangerous Ambush, but you can try out each of those to see what works for you.

  
**\[Plasma Ball\]** Survival Build:  
On this build we're going to sacrifice damage to benefit from her Red mod for better survival, she can tank a lot of hit from Defiler. We will retain the same reactor and external components as well weapons set as the above. The Plasma Ball passive perks uses HP, DEF and MP stats to shield you damages until it gets destroyed.

The skills that we're swapping out are *Skill Concentration, Front Lines, and Emergency Measures*.  
The replacement skills are:   
  
*Increased DEF* (+160.4%)  
*Agony* (+8.5% MP, +38.5%  DEF)  
*Enlightenment* (+15.2% MP)

Optionally, you can swap out her golden ticket with a resistance skill like Antivenom when vs Defiler for example, this way you won't incur massive DoT damages from the poison puddles.



PS: Again, this isn't meant to be an absolute must follow, it's a general knowledge sharing based upon many hours of trials and errors. Should you have much better alternatives, then please share, as we can collaborate for an even more efficient build."

2021 GMC Terrain Blown Engine @ 80k,MechanicAdvice,1i9x5mw,2025-01-25 16:11:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1i9x5mw/2021_gmc_terrain_blown_engine_80k/,Glass-Year6747,,"My engine blew up in my Terrain early October after only owning the vehicle for ~20k miles/8 Months.

Got it towed to a GMC dealership, they fought my warranty company for 2 months until they got asked to show point of failure. Warranty company claims they gave the dealership specific instructions to remove spark plug and use a bore scope to provide photos. Dealership did not follow instructions and disassembled the vehicle(removed oil pan) and warranty decided claim was denied and said there was nothing I could do to reverse the decision because of what the service center did.

Advisor at GMC dealership says ‚Äúwe got GM to pick up $12,500 so that leaves you with a $2500 balance, brand new engine 3 year 100k mile factory warranty.‚Äù

I say sure, as I‚Äôve been in a rental car for over 2.5 months at this point. 

Go in last Thursday with 3k(needed a battery after sitting for so long?) the car would idle and drive at a low speed through parking lot but as soon as I tried to pull out, the car bogged down and rpm‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt increase, blowing a lot of black smoke out of the exhaust. Call the advisor and ask, ‚Äúdid you guys test drive my car?‚Äù He says they did but drop off mileage was 82169 and when I was looking at the dash mileage was 82170‚Ä¶ real thorough test drive I‚Äôd say‚Ä¶.

They said it needed a catalytic converter. Was supposed to be ready for pickup today. I asked him to specifically make sure the vehicle is taken on a test drive before asking me to come pick up. Got a text an hour before close ‚Äúok sorry won‚Äôt be ready today still has issues‚Äù

What else could be wrong with the thing?


TLDR: engine blew up, had a new one installed. Vehicle still not drivable. Catalytic converter replaced. Still not drivable. What else could be going on?

Edit: PS should I have paid anything for this? Feels like since the dealership didn‚Äôt follow instructions that were given it should be their responsibility to cover the repair in full."

This morning when I went out to start the car I had Pre Collision Malfunctions, Parking Break Malfunctions, Cruise Control Malfunctions, Engine Maintenance Required and a couple others all came on. The car was idling rough and would drive rough unless I put in in manual mode and shifted myself. 

I drove the car to AutoZone and had them run the computer and check the battery. The battery came up dying and the computer read cylinder 3 misfire. The tech at AutoZone thought the code could be caused by the dying battery. I replaced the battery and the car ran fine until I got home. I turned the car off but when I started it back up the dash lit back up. 

I live in the Midwest and we did just get through a pretty cold week or two, and the car does still have the salt on it but I tried to wipe down any external sensors. 

Has anyone else encountered these issues before? I plan to try and get the car into the dealership this coming week but if this is a possible fix I can do from home I would prefer to save the money."

Izuku Midoriya: Crouched Alpha at lvl 9 deals 115 damage, and previous levels are adjusted accordingly, and 2nd Gamma is received at level 4.  Gamma now properly pulls targets (bug fix)

Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet): Alpha has larger spread and deals 1 less damage per pellet (at lvl 9 he does 100 damage), and a fully charged Beta requires more height.

Katsuki Bakugo: Alpha deals 7 more damage across all levels, and Gamma now properly drags opponents for the final hit

Katsuki Bakugo (Machine Gun): Now only has 1 Gamma, and 3rd Beta charge is gained at lvl 7.

Ochako Uraraka: Gamma now comes out faster. Gamma does full knockdown upon ""releasing"" the Gamma. Decrease Alpha reload speed at all levels by 1 second.

Shoto Todoroki: Alpha hitbox is widened at all levels, and damage is increased by 5 across all levels. Beta is slightly further away. Gamma travels faster.

Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame): Alpha deals 20 less damage across all levels. Now only has 2 Beta charges. 

Tenya Iida: Alpha deals 5 less damage across all levels. Beta deals 20 less damage at lvl 9, and progression is scaled accordingly.

Asui Tsuyu: Alpha now starts with 3 charges, and deals 10 more damage across all levels

Denki Kaminari: Alpha deals 5 less damage across all levels. Beta has stuns on every hit (NOT electrify). Gamma deals 15 less damage across all levels.

Eijiro Kirishima: Alpha now properly carries, even when turning. Beta deals 15 more damage across all levels, and has significantly longer range at lvls 1-3, and slightly longer range at lvls 4-8, and Beta no longer stops at an opponent- Instead, Kirishima has an active hitbox for Beta for the entire duration.

Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive): Alpha travels slower. Bug fix so that Alpha>Beta movement tech no longer works.

Momo Yaoyorozu: Beta comes out faster and now blocks attacks in a semicircle in front of Momo. Attacks behind Momo still hit. Gamma takes less time to place and start firing.

All Might: Alpha deals 11 less damage across all levels.

All Might (Special Action): It now takes 40 seconds to fully recharge, whether from jump or fully depleting the gauge from carrying someone.

Shoto Aizawa: Alpha now properly pulls targets to you (bug fix). 

Tomura Shigaraki: Both Alpha AND Beta now hit slightly above the ground in a similar manner as Overhaul Gamma, in such a way that Hawks flying at ground level, alongside certain moves performed along the ground after jumping (such as Iida's Alpha- it temporarily stops the damage from what I found). 

Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe): Alpha, Beta, and the last hit of Gamma now hit slightly above the ground in a similar manner as Overhaul Gamma and the Strike Shigaraki changes for the same purposes. Alpha now travels faster and knocks down upon 2nd hit. In addition, the direct hit deals 12 more damage, and the indirect hit deals 10 less damage across all levels. The 1st hit of Gamma knocks down faster so that you cannot perform a second Gamma or beta after landing a direct Beta at the same target.

All for One (Special Action): Special Action now has a 5 second cooldown, instead of 20 seconds.

Dabi: HP increased to 400. Alpha travels faster. Beta now deals all damage in a single hit, and does 160 damage at max level, with level one dealing 20 more damage, and the levels inbetween adjusting accordingly. Additionally, you have 1 more charge at levels 1-3.

Dabi (Crazy Torch): HP decreased to 300. Alpha, when not powered by Gamma, charges faster. Beta no longer has tracking, and travels further when not powered by Gamma. Additionally, the final hit of Beta always does a hard knockdown, and the kick, when the grab does not connect, allows for recovery. Finally, the hit registration is now fixed. Gamma has a cooldown similar to Iida's Gamma, and no longer generates flame rings while active. Additionally, upon ending Gamma, it always does the final burst. 

Himiko Toga: Alpha, at levels 1-3, have a cooldown of .75 second per bullet, and at levels 7-9, a cooldown of 0.4 seconds. Beta cooldown increased by 7 seconds. Beta's range for the initial hit is doubled. At max level, the first hit of Beta deals 10 more damage, and the second and third hits now deal 42 more damage, and the following hits deal 50 damage each. (For an explaination, the ""dash"" at the start of Beta comes out in 3 hits. Right now, it deals 10, 33, and 33 damage, respectively. Afterwards, we get the 88 damage per hit. With the changes I made, it deals I think 41 damage more for hitting all hits? However, not hitting it at the start means you deal less damage.) Gamma has better tracking, a cooldown increase of 8 seconds, and deals 7 less damage across all levels per needle. (The following cooldown changes are VERY dependent on the Special Action changes I made)

Himiko Toga (Sting Dance): When using Alpha, there is a .5 second delay instead of the .33(?) delay before you can fire another Alpha, the bullet count is now increased to 10, and the cooldown is increased to 1.75 per bullet. Beta's cooldown is now doubled. Gamma's distance is increased by 1.5 at levels 4-9, alongside the speed of the second part of Gamma, and Gamma now does not gain an additional charge. Additionally, the cooldown for each charge is increased by 3.5 seconds (The following cooldown changes are VERY dependent on the Special Action changes I made)

Himiko Toga (Special Action): Transform now no longer resets your cooldowns. Instead, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma all recharge at the same rate while Transformed. (This effectively requires Toga to use blood effectively for longer periods of time to fully recharge their abilities. Also, Transform effectively has a ""cooldown"" until the next down OR until Gamma recharges- which, for both, is around 12-13 seconds \[per charge\] if I did my math right, meaning she ACTUALLY has to juggle cooldowns.)

Endeavor: Alpha and Beta bug fixes (ofc). Alpha now hits one additional time for each bullet (without changing the duration), and he has 6 bullets at all levels. Beta's first hit deals 40 more damage at level 9, 20 more damage at lvl 1, and all other levels are adjusted accordingly.  Gamma now takes less time to activate.

Endeavor (Special Action): Sustaining Sprint while using special action now costs 75% of the current drain. Using it to jump consumes 35% of the gauge, instead of 50%, and has less startup, and you can't use it if the gauge is under 35%.

Mirio: Increased to 250 HP (Mirio mains before the nerfs- tell me the old combos plz- I'll take it into consideration when posting to the discord)

Nejire Hado: Alpha travel speed is increased. Beta size is decreased, and subsequent hits deal damage every .5 seconds instead of .25 seconds(? Still- the point stands). Additionally, the gauge for Beta goes down faster. 

Overhaul: Alpha deals 5 more damage on the initial hit (so 80 per bullet, as, right now, the first hit is 15, while the other 3 are 20). Gamma deals 30 less damage across all levels, but stuns for twice as long.

Overhaul (Special Action): When healing, instead of fully healing and healing 125 shields while self-healing and fully healing both upon healing an ally, both using up both charges, self-healing heals for 175, prioritizing HP, and uses one charge, and healing an ally heals for 300, prioritizing HP, and uses one charge. (This allows him to be more flexible with his heals but heal for less during a fight most of the time. Also, allows for the second charge to be used to disrupt a combo even if you healed once.)

Twice: Remove Gamma tracking. (From what I know, Twice was fine before they added tracking? Correct me if I'm wrong tho)

Compress: Alpha stun is reduced, and fire rate is SLIGHTLY reduced (Maybe to 1.5 times a second instead of what seems to be 2 times a second?). 

Hawks:  Alpha deals 3 less damage at all levels. The subsequent hits of Beta now deal the same damage as the first hit. The last hit of Melee now causes a full knockdown. 

Itsuka Kendo: Alpha has a tighter spread. Beta insta-break bug fixed (if it wasn't already). Gamma damage increased by 36 damage at lvl 9, and damage for previous levels is adjusted accordingly. 

Mt. Lady: Gamma recharges at 6.5 seconds per bullet at levels 4-6, and at 5 seconds per bullet at levels 7-9. 

Cementoss: Alpha structure is shorter, and the second hit of Alpha deals 20 less damage at all levels. Gamma is thinner at levels 4-9. Beta is now fixed, if they didn't fix the wall bug stuff where it instantly broke sometimes. (People who have fought more Cementoss, and people who play him- tell me if these are bad changes)

Ibara: Alpha finishes faster. Beta now deal their second hit of damage faster, and finishes faster. Gamma hits faster. (I feel like the main reason why she isn't that great compared to the rest of the cast is because of how immobile she is. Hopefully this would help her? I don't play her though. I once again request help from people who main this character.)

Kurogiri: Alpha now properly is perpedicular to the surface it hits, if it hits a wall, floor, or ceiling. Beta damage is reduced by 15 at all levels. Gamma travels faster. (The beta change is mostly because triple Beta into Alpha is a thing, and while I think it's good that they have it, it does need toned down a LITTLE so that most the cast isn't screwed over by it and being flesh.)

Present Mic: Beta, when held down, now deals 5 less damage per hit. Gamma now has 2 charges instead of 3, and deals 20 less damage at all levels. Additionally, the multipliers for 1 and 2 teammates down or dead is now 1.25 and 1.5, respectively. (He should still be a proper strike character with this, but he's definitely overtuned, even if not as overtuned as other characters)

Present Mic (Special Action): Has 2 charges instead of 3.

If you're wondering, the character I changed the MOST was likely both Togas. In third place, it's Strike Dabi thanks to all the Beta and Gamma changes lol. In fairness though, I overhauled how Toga's Transform worked, and made sure to change a bunch of cooldowns, alongside the other changes I made.  Anyway, that's quite literally EVERY character, except for Denki (Lightning), which hasn't released yet, so if these changes are trash, tell me which ones! I'll start copying the list of changes at 3 PM CST to the official discord TOMORROW, so 23 hours and 50 minutes from this post going live (it took me 3 hours to type this all out, thanks to me having to test/find some stuff and find proper damage numbers, as the database only displays 1 of several damage numbers for multi-hit moves).

"Sadness.. my precious siamese, Takie, went to her long rest..",Petloss,1i9x2ih,2025-01-25 16:07:04,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1i9x2ih/sadness_my_precious_siamese_takie_went_to_her/,KattNine,,"She was almost 15 years old.. my preciouz siamese, Takie she was a treasure.. sweet and loving and would stare lovingly  straight into your soul when she layed on your lap and purr so loudly anytime you so much as glance at her. She would dash over to wherever you were and prance around happily. If she was in my lap while i was at my computer and i stopped petting her she would often get up and stand in front of my monitor and dance around and rub against it like she was telling me ""hey i want love.. pet me instead"" there was so much positve about her.. so much love.. 

she would lay in my lap so she could face me and stare at me rezching a paw towards ny face as if she wanted to pet me too...so many headbutts.. so much purring 

I am.. so distressed.. it wasn't enough time..

She had advanced stage lymphoma in her intestine.. steroids and shots gave her an extra 3 months.. 

i regret not spending more time with her.. i regret not having her in our room when we slept because we were afraid she'd leave diarrhea over the room.. i feel cheated of time.

The last set of treatments only prolonged her a week or so.. it wasnt doing enough.. she wasnt gaining weight.. she was dehydrated despite drinking constantly.. the past week she was fading.. she was no longer eating.. no longer racing me to her bowl.. no longer climbing over everything on the counter to get to me as i dished up food.. no pawing at the air saying ""go faster.. i want my food now"".. i could barely make out her purrs..

Wednesday i went into the living room to see her.. she didnt want to get off my moms lap... she would usually run over to me the moment i sat down, no matter where she was ir whose lap she was currntly on.. i was her favorite person.. eager to jump in my lap.. 

Thursday she was on an empty chair andbi nudged her off of it to get her to come to me on the counch.. she moved slowly.. but definitely came to me.. and lay down slowly.. no big purrs.. just.. lying there.. not really reacting to my petting.. after about half hour of that she got up and just stood next to the end of the couch staring at a wall for a few min. I was afraid she was going to go hide.. but she wandered into the kitchen to drink.. she'd barely eaten this week.. hadnt asked me for food at all tho it was available to her several times a day by my mom or husband trying to give her fresh food..

I went to get my 2nd cat her mid afternoon meal.. Takie slowly headed from the kitchen,  where the water was at, to the dining room.. she headed towards the hall door as i started to take the 2nd cats food back to my room.. the two cats don't get along at all so they have separate spaces.. but Takie wanted to go to my room.. so i let her in.. and put my other cat into another room with her food. Takie slowly walked to my bed once i sat down and just continued to lay in my lap.. still no purring.. but i appreciate that she still wanted to sit with me.. her nose has boogers all over it and she's wheezing.. its been a reoccurring thing for the past 5 months. hours later she jumps down and drinks more.. but she starts to try to go under my bed.. she only does that when shes hiding.. i managed to grab her before she got under and took her back to the living room.. she went over to an empty chair and layed down..  i let my mom know she had tried to hide...

its possible this last bout was exasperated by a dental infection,  but with the past 3 months of intestinal issues, getting dental surgery would have been expensive and dangerous and not really buy us more time considering the lymphoma.. i still spent the night wondering if just antibiotics would help perk her back up.. 

I went back to my room for awhile.. tried to put it out of my mind for a bit.. cuddle with my other cat.. thinking some more.. i went out to talk to my mom again about next steps.. Takie was on my moms lap again.. she had doctors appointment Friday and Saturday and after the appointment on Saturday we'd be without someone with a car.. i figured we'd have to see about doung it sunday or Monday when my husband was off..  i was honestly afraid ahe wouldnt last til then but was hoping to have a few more days with her...

After my mom went to bed, Takie was sitting on my dads lap.. i didn't want to disturb them.. when everyone went to bed.. i decided to stay up.. i didnt want her to be alone.. i needed more time with her.. i cried alot . Big heartwrenching sobs üò≠ i sat in the living room with her, petting her for an hour before i had to use the bathroom.. she walked to the hall door to go to my room.. so i took her with me.

For the most of the night she sat on my lap.. a couple times i moved her tonuse the bathroom again and she went over to my husband, who was sleeping, and lay down on him like she usually did.. i sobbed so hard because he wasnt awake to even know and my heart is breaking.. and he moved so i had to take her back because she's so frail and unsteady.. and i sit there with her til 7am when he gets up for work...

Soon after we find out my mom wants to just make the vet appointment for today because she doesnt know if the vet is open on the weekend and doesnt want to wait til monday in case Takie gets worse.. my husband is in shock.. he thought he had a few days to prepare.. i am so glad i stayed up with her now.. but its not enough time... there is no such thing as enough tho..

He decided to call out for work.. we spent the day with her.. me bursting into tears anytime i think of something precious she has done in the past that i will never see her do again.. he bursts into tears as well.. because they are beloved.. each and every one if them.. but Takie loved us all equally, which is rare for us.. and she had so much love to give. 

We had til about 2pm to spend with her before the vet could see us. I didn't sleep.. i couldn't eat.. i didnt want to do anything but pet her soft fur.. i brushed her and saved the fur.. it seemed lije a better momento then ashes.. ive been saving it occasionally for awhile.. 

I put her in the carrier.. i took it to the car.. my husband drove and my mom sat in the back with Takie, telling her what a good kitty she is.. her comaplinive meows are lacking their usual power and im trying so hard not to burst into tears because i don't want my husband to burst into tears while he's driving. Its so difficult.. thankfully the vet is only a couple minutes away. I carry her into the vet and we have to sit and wait.. they knew why we were here so at least we didn't have to check in.

Someone else was in the office and mentioned ""oh its a siamese!"" And i burst into tears again... we were there like 90 min total.. way too much time just waiting.. when they took us in they asked what we were there for.. i was.. shocked.. because i figured my mom had said when she made the appointment.. i asked as much.. i guess they have to confirm next steps...heart wrenching having to say it even once... 

she went to get the vet and we sat with Takie in the cage still on the table..after awhile i brought the cage to the bench and opened it so i could pet her. My husband was there in the room with me too and pet her as well. 

The vet finally came in and gave her a look over.. and told us that even tho they could try treating her, it would be a lot if poking and produng and surgery to fugure iut whats going on and if its fixable and considering her weight.. and previous treatments and dehydration despite drinking so much he couldnt disagree with our decision to let her go to her long sleep...

He swaddled her in a blanket and took her to get a sedative and a catheter. He came back with her and gave her to me to say our goodbyes.. i kissed her head and told her what a beautiful wonderful kitty she had been and told her to come find us again soon in another life..i held her as the vet gave her the final shot and within a heartbeat she had her last breath.. it was fast.. and painless and dignified.. and I'm so glad i could be there holding her for our goodnight and goodbye..

I had dreamed a month or so before that i should be there wjth her at the end.. this was the first time i was there when we took them to the vet to give them their final sleep.. i needed her to know how loved she was until the very end.. and im glad i could do it..

But I'm heart broken.. and even tho i still have another cat that hates when she can't be in the same room as me.. they are not the same.. and is greatly missed and will be for a long time

What kinds of reports to DoorDash negatively affect the driver?,doordash,1i9wz1b,2025-01-25 16:02:46,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1i9wz1b/what_kinds_of_reports_to_doordash_negatively/,superlosernerd,,"I order doordash a TON, and have rarely ever had issues with restaurants. But recently a couple of newer restaurants in the area have been forgetting items in the order, or twice even giving me someone else's order or a completely wrong order. 

My concern is when I report a completely wrong order. I don't blame the dasher for it, I think it's the restaurant's responsibility to give them the right name. However, I've been worried about reporting it because I don't know if doordash blames the dasher for it. I've been torn between recouping my wasted money and making sure I don't put someone's job at risk.

It made me realize that I don't actually know what in regards to my activity on the app may negatively affect my dasher. I know reporting a missing order or a poor rating will. Are there any other things that reflect poorly on the dashers themselves?

For the record, I'm asking so I don't accidentally put someone's livelihood at risk, not so I can complain about the dashers."

I‚Äôm 16 and I gotta watch my sibling everyday of the week almost I have a job as well but most the times I‚Äôm not able to work because I have to watch my little brother. I feel like bad son for not wanting to watch him anymore because I know my mom has to work to pay bills. but she ended up quitting her job where she was working from home to go back to school and I was fine with that until I realized how much time I‚Äôm losing to myself. I don‚Äôt go out anymore because she‚Äôll tell me last minute she has to work. But it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs not willing to create a schedule with me so I can have time for me and the things I want to do. Anytime I tell her I was planning on doing something that day she‚Äôll tell me ‚Äúwhat bills do I have to pay‚Äù when she says that it makes me feel guilty. But what I hate the most is she‚Äôll leverage my job,sports, and my phone if I try and leave.

The thing is she can go to work whenever because she does dominos,uber eats, and DoorDash and the fact that she can be flexible with what she does and doesn‚Äôt wanna create a schedule so I can do the things I want to do irritates me. The other day she sat in the house and did nothing so I decided it would be ok if I went to work she then told me she was going in later and I had to watch my little brother at the time he was in school and I was home for the day because my school was closed. She had told me she was going to work in the morning but she ended up coming back and laying down on her phone and she went in later and told me to watch him. I have no say in if can‚Äôt watch him or not it‚Äôs just sprung on me out of nowhere whenever she feels like going. Anytime I wanna come to a middle ground she belittles me and makes it like my opinion means nothing the whole reason I got a job was to provide for myself because anytime I would ask my mom for money she would just leverage it against me.

This aspect is definitely worse for support, and the jungling potential is next to none. Sobek's jungle clear is just horrifically slow, and due to low scaling you never really do damage. All you have is your displacement and your ult.

Maybe this aspect was more meant for solo lane, so Sobek could clear harpies and have abilities up for lane, and so his dash wouldn't be stuffed by minions.

If it was actually meant for jungle, it needs some serious damage buffs. Maybe his passive could be changed to something like this:

Ambush Predator- For every 10 seconds spent in the jungle, Sobek gains 1 stack, up to 3. Sobek receives 15% intelligence scaling on his abilities for each stack. For each 10sec Sobek spends outside of the jungle, he loses one stack.

What are your experiences with this aspect, and what do you think about a potential change?"

I‚Äôm reaching out to ask for help regarding a serious car accident I was involved in on January 22nd, 2025 at approximately 11:30pm near 111th Ave and 149 St right in front of the wholesale club in Edmonton. The accident involved my vehicle, a white 2015 Honda Civic, and a semi-truck that was performing an illegal U-turn without signaling starting from the far right lane and crossing multiple lanes in icy winter conditions.

During the incident, my car slid on the icy road despite applying the brakes, ultimately colliding with the truck, which was blocking every lane on the road. The accident resulted in significant damage to my vehicle and has caused ongoing physical and emotional distress for me.

If you, or someone you know, witnessed the accident or have access to security cameras in the area (e.g., from local businesses or homes), I‚Äôd deeply appreciate your help. Even footage from nearby dash cams or any information about other witnesses could be extremely helpful.

Thank you. "

**Chapter 10: Blazing spear:**

As Kosma walked back to the courtyard, Jed saw a marker appear on one of the gunships,

¬†

""Hey Kosma... looks like you get to ride in that thing, sure beats walking!"" her face lit up as Jed said that. Kosma started to run excitedly towards the plane when she felt something pulling at her backpack.

¬†

""NO, YOU DON'T!"" said Kalax as Kosma stared back at him, flicking her ears back and giving the captain a glare.

¬†

""It's so damn cute when you do that..."", Jed admitted, which only made Kosma angrier,

¬†

""Shut up!"" she squirmed in Kalax's iron grip as he finally let go, causing Kosma to fall to the ground with a loud thud. It took restraint, but Jed made no comment.

¬†

""The enemy has set up anti-aircraft batteries around the pulse cannon, we have already lost three of our dropships to them,"" Kalax explained as he displayed a holographic map from a projector on his shoulder while the troopers gathered around it. There was a heavy anti-aircraft battery protected by small armor at each corner of the cannon's platform. Kalax pointed to a large road that rose above the jungle, connecting the control center to the position of the anti-orbital gun.

¬†

""We'll take this logistics highway all the way to their position, but if our scouts are right, we should expect very heavy resistance. We only need to take out one of those batteries and our transports can land... AM I CLEAR TROOPERS!"" the troopers quickly replied with a resounding ""YES SIR!"", with a metallic ""clank"" as their left hand slammed against their chest as they performed the Indaran salute.¬† Horror washed over Kosma's face at the thought of having to walk all the way to the pulse cannon, and Kalax only confirmed that the path would be littered with enemies. It would be a long slog.

¬†

""If you want, we can stop here. Doesn't look like any enemies are coming,"" Jed said, seeing how beaten Kosma looked,

¬†

""No, let's just do this... it would be incredibly annoying to try to sleep with the warzone atmosphere all around, I mean, blow up the enemy mothership with the cannon and we win, right?"" she asked with a nervous smile.

¬†

""I really hope this is the end of the level, this seems like a fun place to stay... you know, when there aren't murder-bots everywhere..."", Jed replied as Kosma nodded in agreement.

Kosma followed the group as the troopers chatted among themselves. They might only be simple AIs, but the fact that they were robots made it ironically a little easier for Kosma to pretend they were real. As they walked past a cargo bay full of containers and automated vehicles sitting idle at their stations. Kosma ran quickly to try to activate one of them, but to no avail,

""COME ON!... I really don't want to slog through this on foot. Jed, does a prompt appear to interact with any of these?"" asked Kosma as she hooked a cable from her wrist terminal into one of the trucks and randomly tapped things on the interface.

¬†

""At least you have the robots with you... what's left of them,"" Jed replied with a hint of sadness as Kosma resigned herself to walking to the enemy position. As the huge sliding doors leading to the highway opened with a loud hydraulic hiss, Kalax turned to look at Kosma,

¬†

""Trailblazer, I have some very distressing news,"" his tone was incredibly dark and made her fear what information he was about to give her,

¬†

""Y...yes?"" she asked out of pure reflex, though she knew he would continue his dialog anyway,

¬†

""I know how much it meant to you to walk over 8000 meters of bridge, but I ordered APCs to carry us as it will be safer,"" the Captain explained ironically, Kosma tilted her head to the side as she imagined the non-existent mocking grin on his mouthless face. His eyes, however, managed to express the joking tone as he pointed at a pair of incoming Sadurian defense force transports,

¬†

""Son of a..."" Kosma exclaimed, her face lighting up as she watched the transports descend before them, dropping a pair of six-wheeled APCs before flying away. The boxy vehicles were covered in angular armor, the logo of the 118th Battalion stamped on the side next to the vehicles' serial numbers. As the doors opened, she noticed that the transports had room for a gunner, a driver, and eight passengers.

They could see the battle raging throughout the facility, with the defense turrets on the control building shooting down enemy dropships and squadrons of defense drones fighting some kind of enemy equivalent. Still hopelessly outnumbered, the defenses would at least hold the line until they shot down the mothership. Deep down, however, Kosma and Jed knew that the battle was nothing more than a skybox, albeit a convincing one.

The APCs had been delivered with just enough troops to fill every seat, including hers and Kalax's. He turned to Kosma and pointed to the vehicle on the left,

""Get on the turret of the rampart,"" the captain ordered as Kosma boarded the vehicle, relief washing over her. She knew they would have to fight through a bunch of enemies to get to the other side, but at least it would not necessarily be easier. The rampart APCs would make it faster, especially if she didn't have to drive. The interior was a bit cramped, but that was to be expected from a military transport, Kosma was just glad to have a comfortable padded seat.

The moment she got into the vehicle, the camera zoomed in as Kosma got into the gunner's seat and stared at the controls, unsure what to do, when a popup appeared with the controls for Jed.

¬†

""Uhhh... yeah, because of course I can operate military hardware without training..."" as she spoke, Jed tested the controls, her hands automatically reaching for a joystick at her side and pressing a button that lowered a screen showing a camera view of the turret.

¬†

""It says... I can transform the weapon?"" Jed said a little confused as he pressed the middle mouse button. The APC's weapon rotated, transforming into something shorter but wider as Jed fired a large burst of blue energy bolts at it, which spread out in a cone pattern. Switching back to its original mode, the barrel lengthened and the weapon's struts retracted, making it appear thinner as ventilation slits opened on the sides. This mode fired a concentrated burst of energy, presumably designed to take out armored targets, while the other mode was designed to hit groups of smaller enemies.

¬†

""Now that's weird..."" said Jed, switching between modes, firing at lampposts and inactive driverless vehicles to test the weapon.

¬†

""Jed... get your hands off that keyboard. I always wanted to fire one of those things!"", Kosma excitedly fired the weapon, riddling a nearby car with holes from the dispersal mode, then firing a concentrated blast at the engine, causing it to erupt in a fiery explosion,

¬†

""YESSSH!"" Kosma exclaimed with a sadistic grin, feeling like she could take on anything with this turret,

¬†

""Hey psycho, when you are ready to go give the word,"" Jed playfully replied, making Kosma frown, she tried to look at the camera but could feel it was somehow outside the vehicle.

¬†

""Well, let's go... I want to see what this thing does to the robots!"" she made the turret face forward as Jed pressed the interaction button to close the tutorial popup. Shortly thereafter, a female robot voice exclaimed

¬†

""Next stop, anti-orbital cannon!"", the transports began to move forward, side by side. The APC was driven by a slightly smaller and thinner trooper with a less angular design and a vaguely feminine shape.

¬†

""What the hell? Who's driving?"" asked Jed, slightly confused.

¬†

""Another trooper?"" Kosma replied as she moved the turret from side to side, scanning for enemies.

¬†

""Why would they make female and male robots?"" wondered Jed aloud.

¬†

""Originally they all had the same voice, but the support troopers were made smaller and with lighter armor to fit better on vehicles and be more mobile, the soldiers kept calling them female troopers soo... on the next versions they just gave them a girly voice, pretty silly if you ask me,"" she explained while trying to adjust the turret seat to a comfortable position.

¬†

""It probably helps morale, she sounds kind of cute!"" said Jed, oblivious to the jealous look Kosma shot at the driver.

¬†

""JED! ARE YOU HORNY FOR A PIECE OF MILITARY HARDWARE?"" yelled Kosma as she poked her head out of the turret hatch.

¬†

""I just said she looks cute, I can't even see what she looks like from this angle... Get back inside, I see something approaching!"", Kosma grumbled as she got back inside and closed the hatch. Seeing that a group of heavy walkers and spider-bots had set up a roadblock, she quickly opened fire, Kalax's transports following shortly after.

¬†

""DON'T CHANGE SUBJECT ON ME, BOY!"" a very jealous Kosma shouted as she blasted the roadblock with the turret.

¬†

""Can we discuss this when we're not in combat!"", Jed replied, starting to raise his voice, he didn't want Kosma to get killed over such a stupid argument.

¬†

¬†""Relax, this thing is bolt-proof, ironically it feels like playing a video game. I'm not really mad,"" she said in a cheerful tone, easing Jed's worries, although she was a bit jealous of this driver-trooper.

¬†

They spread out easily to take care of groups of small robots, adjusting their spread pattern based on the distance to the targets. Sending shards of metal everywhere as their power cores exploded violently on impact. One of the heavy walkers locked its weapons on Kosma's APC, firing large bolts of energy into the armor. The attack shook the transport, nearly knocking Kosma out of her seat and making her regret that she hadn't used her seatbelt, something she quickly set about correcting. However, the attack only managed to dent the plating and take a small portion of the vehicle's health bar.

She fired back using the turret's armor piercing mode, which didn't seem to be very effective against the machine's thick front plating, sending sparks and a burst of plasma on impact as the bolts dissipated against it.

¬†

""Aim for its ocular sensor to stun it, if you have bad aim, shoot for the legs,"" the captain advised over the comms as Kosma struggled to aim the weapon while taking enemy fire.

¬†

""Need help?"", Jed offered.

¬†

""No, no... otherwise I'll never learn"", after a few seconds of fiddling with the control joystick she managed to blow three legs off the walker, causing it to collapse to the ground and burst into flames shortly after.

¬†

""NICE SHOT!"" Jed and Kalax shouted simultaneously, making Kosma dizzy.

¬†

A Sadurian gunship, followed by a pair of enemy fighter drones, began to fly parallel to the transports,

¬†

""Get these things off me, sir!"" the pilot yelled over the comms as Kosma turned the turret and began guiding the targets and peppering them with disperse mode.

¬†

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING P-26!? YOU ARE APPROACHING AN ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY!"" By the time the pilot heard Kalax's warning, it was too late as a missile hit the gunship in one of its engines. It spun out of control as it barreled toward the bridge, Kosma's APC narrowly avoiding it. The gunship's fuel tank exploded as it hit the pavement.

""Damn... no survivors, don't stop,"" Kalax said in his usual stern voice as the drones turned their attention to the transports and began to follow them.

The drones fired salvos of rockets at the APCs as Kosma swung the turret to face them. She heard one of the missiles explode right next to the vehicle, causing it to lurch sideways as the suspension did its best to absorb the shock.

¬†

""AAAHHH!"" Kosma exclaimed as the jolt made her head hit the screen hard, shattering the glass. Had she not been wearing her helmet, she probably would have broken her nose. At least the screen was still working.

She alternated between intercepting the missiles and firing at the drones themselves, with Jed helping her aim. One of the drones crashed into the jungle as she managed to inflict critical damage, while the other rammed in front of the transports and into a truck loaded with energy cells, causing it to explode in an azure blast of energy and electric arcs that temporarily disrupted the vehicles' electronics. The drivers stopped immediately,

¬†

""DAMN IT!"" yelled Kalax as he stared at the massive gap created by the explosion, as a voice came over a nearby PA speaker as a security camera stared at the APCs,

¬†

""I would appreciate it if you would stop damaging my facility more than the invaders! However, I know a way you can cross, let me angle the solar panels,"" the voice belonged to the Indaran technician monitoring their progress from the control facility. Soon gaps opened in the ground at the sides of the road and large photovoltaic panels appeared, angled toward the transports with one side raised toward the abyss.

¬†

""Do they want us to..."" said Kosma in a worried voice, noticing that the solar panels were wide enough to fit the entire APC,

¬†

""YOU HEARD THE MAN! PUNCH IT!"" shouted Kalax in a commanding voice, but the vehicles didn't move an inch. Meanwhile, Kosma saw more enemy drones approaching from the front and prepared herself,

¬†

""Sir... are you suffering from suicidal impulses?"" the driver of the captain's APC replied in a condescending tone.

¬†

""KOSMA! GET YOUR TROOPER OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND TAKE OVER!"", Kalax yelled as she heard shifting noises and troopers complaining over the comms,

¬†

""SIR! SEEK A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??!"", Kosma heard the driver protest as she got out of the turret seat and made her way to her driver,

¬†

""Uhh... can you please go to the turret?... why am I even talking to this thing..."" she said, staring at the round face of her driver, when to her surprise the trooper answered, mainly thanks to Jed pressing the ""change seat"" button prompt,

¬†

""Ooo, I get to shoot the bad guys now!"" the trooper exclaimed excitedly as she got to the turret. Meanwhile, Kalax was having trouble with his own driver,

""Hey Trailblazer, just for the record, I would never hit a real woman,"" Kalax said over the comms before she heard a loud ""CLANG"" as the captain promptly slapped the trooper to take her place. Kosma could hear Jed laughing audibly over her head,

""ALLRIGHT, YOU TAKE THE LEFT, I TAKE THE RIGHT!"" Kalax ordered as his APC barreled towards one of the solar panels, Kosma staring at the wheels and pedals a bit confused,

¬†

""Jed... do you mind? It's been a long time since I've driven anything with wheels..."" the nervousness in her voice was palpable as the enemy drones were already firing missiles at her vehicle. Fortunately, the soldier on the turret was doing a good job of intercepting most of them,

¬†

""Absolutely!"" said Jed after a quick glance at the popup for the driving controls before accelerating towards the improvised ramp,

¬†

""CAPTAIN YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER I'VE SERVED WITH!"" shouted Kalax's former driver as her APC flew over the cap, Kosma's soon to follow. She felt the suspension bounce violently on contact with the ground as Jed lost control of the vehicle and veered toward a gap in the bridge's walls.

She screamed in terror as the transport plunged into the jungle below, Jed watching in horror as the APC crashed into some jagged rocks. For a few seconds, the camera hovered over the wrecked vehicle, the last checkpoint loaded as she was about to jump the gap,

¬†

""Kosma... I..."", Jed said as Kosma was about to tear off the steering wheel from the sheer stress of hyperventilating,

¬†

""I know Jed, I know,"" Kosma said with a deep, long sigh, ""No matter how many times it happens, it's still horrible... let's... LET'S DO THIS!"" she exclaimed, trying to keep her brave face on. She knew Jed understood her pain and stress, but it was something she mostly did to trick herself into moving forward without having constant breakdowns.

¬†

""Are you sure you want me to drive?"" asked Jed hesitantly as a missile hit the back of the APC, knocking Kosma to the ground,

¬†

""YES, YOU IDIOT!"" she shouted as Jed regained control and heard Kala's ex-driver repeat her voice line as her vehicle jumped with him following through the left solar panel. This time he made the jump, this time maintaining control of the vehicle as they barreled down the highway. Dodging enemy attacks as the trooper in the gunner's seat did her best to keep enemy drones off their tail.

¬†

While Jed hadn't exactly kept the APC intact, it was still running, and Kosma herself remained in one piece. They were almost at the anti-orbital cannon. A gigantic piece of artillery with a rectangular barrel the size of a skyscraper, secured by three pairs of struts along its length. It stood on a square pyramid-like base surrounded by fortifications that had been taken over by the enemy.

Kosma saw a pair of vanguard units at the base of the pyramid's access ramp. Their gunner was busy targeting something behind them, so Jed simply accelerated toward one of them. As was probably scripted, Kalax ran for the other, and the vanguard eliminators were crushed under the weight of the armored vehicles,

""WOOOHOOOOO!!! That was cathartic, this thing is unstoppable!"" shouted Kosma as she felt the last pair of wheels crush the robot,

¬†

""You... really don't want to know how much health we have left..."", Jed said with a hint of concern in his voice as he stopped abruptly in front of a row of pylons along their path,

¬†

""EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE TRANSPOT, WE MUST FOLLOW ON FOOT!"", Kalax shouted as the troopers started to get out of both vehicles. Reluctantly, Kosma got out of the driver's seat as she stared in shock at the sorry state of her APC. The few pieces of armor that hadn't fallen off were riddled with holes and dents, blackened from the fire and explosions, one of the rear wheels was missing entirely, and the headlights had been shot out. On the other hand, Kala's vehicle was spotless, as if it had just rolled off the assembly line,

¬†

""JED YOU ARE A HORRIBLE DRIVER!"" exclaimed Kosma as she pointed with both hands at her barely functioning ride,

¬†

""Unlike us, his was probably indestructible... I got us here in one piece, didn't I?"" replied Jed,

¬†

""That's... technically correct, when you rammed a rock through the cabin, I was only crushed by it, but not split in half,"" Kosma replied cynically,

¬†

""Please don't joke about such things,"" Jed replied in a hurt voice, feeling extremely guilty about the accident,

¬†

""Look, it's either cynical humor or crying... these batteries aren't going to blow themselves up, let's just get this damn level over with... I need a very long shower,"" Kosma said, trying to summon up the courage for the coming battle, as one of the Troopers pointed to something in the sky,

¬†

""INCOMING!"" he shouted as Jed saw red bullet-shaped symbols appear below them, causing Kosma to immediately move out of the way while Kalax pushed one of his troopers out of one of the circles. A single large shell split into a few dozen fragments mid-flight, landing exactly where the circles had predicted, blowing up the APCs and taking out a couple of troopers,

¬†

""YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE AND DESTROYED MY VEHICLE! YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER EVER!"" one of the drivers yelled at Kalax as he ran for cover,

¬†

""HAD I LET YOU KEEP DRIVING WE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, NOW SHUT UP AND RUN TROOPER!"", Kalax replied,

¬†

""Can you see the icons too?"" asked Jed as Kosma froze in shock after a grenade exploded a few meters away from her,

¬†

""WHAT ICONS!?"" she yelled in confusion,

¬†

""The game will tell me where the shells will land, just give me full control, even if I make you stand still, okay?"" said Jed as he saw another set of circles appear, causing her to move slightly to the side. Kosma saw the grenades explode around her again, only a few meters away from turning her into red mist,

¬†

""Okay... that's not scary at all..."", Kosma said with a nervous laugh as Jed pushed her forward.

¬†

""Ma'am, I just wanted to let you know that I do not blame you for losing my vehicle..."", Kosma's former driver said in the sleepiest voice her voice modulator could produce. Kosma completely ignored her, having other priorities at the moment.

¬†

At the top of the pyramid, around the massive rotating base of the anti-orbital gun, the enemy had placed AA batteries at the four corners of the structure. The anti-aircraft weapons were large three-legged machines that bore a resemblance to heavy walkers, except they replaced the heavy repeating blasters with an array of missile tubes that fired at incoming security drones from the facility. Protected by dozens of spider-bots, the Heavy Walkers' vanguard units and battle drones, along with transports flying overhead, made Kosma wish she had stayed in the underwater facility.

Running from cover to cover, dodging mortar rounds, Kosma already felt defeated and braced herself for another long series of deaths,

¬†

""Jed... do you have a plan? because I doubt 16 troopers are going to do much against all of... THAT!"" she exclaimed as Jed made her dodge an incoming burst of enemy fire from a walker that took out a trooper behind her, ""15 troopers..."" she said amidst panting,

¬†

""I have a plan, but you won't like it, you've played your share of video games, right?"" asked Jed, struggling to concentrate on dodging the grenades and the conversation at the same time,

¬†

""Yeah..."" she nodded confused,

¬†

""You know when you get frustrated from dying too often and just run past the enemies to complete the objective?"" he asked as Kosma took a split second to give him an incredulous look,

¬†

""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DESTROY THE AA BATTERIES WITHOUT GETTING ANNIHILATED BY EVERYTHING IN THE SURROUNDING!"" she shouted as a piece of shrapnel clipped one of the tips of her tail, making her squeal,

¬†

""Those mortars are relentlessly targeting you, and if you don't stop to attack something and spam your dodge move, we can just trick them into bombing their own robots!"" shouted Jed as a stray shot hit Kosma in the chest, her armor managing to absorb most of the impact,

¬†

""Ouch... good, now focus!"" said Kosma, crushing her last vial of regen-gel and shaking her head at how rude that came out, ""I mean it sounds like a decent plan, but enough chatter... let's do this!¬†

¬†

With her thruster-assisted dodge and rocket boots, she quickly outpaced Kalax and the troopers. Running into the middle of the enemy formation, Jed had them running in circles for a moment that felt like an eternity to Kosma as energy bolts came at her from all directions. Once she was surrounded, Jed waited for the markers of the next mortar strike and let her boost jump out of the way, the explosions from the barrage pushing her further.

She landed awkwardly, belly up, with burning robot parts raining all around her. She used her back-mounted thrusters to immediately get back up and continue her mad dash for the AA tripod,

¬†

""JED, I HATE YOU SO MUCH!"" she shouted as she parried a blow from a vanguard unit's blade before lunging backwards to see it torn apart by a blast from a heavy walker meant for her. She threw herself into the air again, and in a clearing in the jungle below, she caught a glimpse of the machine responsible for the mortars. Like its AA cousin, it was clearly based on the Heavy Walker, but thicker to support the weight of its massive armament. It had ground anchors that pinned it to the ground, presumably to keep it from tipping over from the recoil of firing the weapon.

¬†

""TRUST THE PROCESS!"" he replied, letting her slide right under the AA battery as the enemies swarmed around her. She heard the mortar fire and, sword in hand, dashed out from under the tripod. Skewering a spider-bot through its optical sensor, and fueled by adrenaline, she lifted the blade with the inert robot still impaled. She planted one foot on the ground and used the thrusters on her other boot to spin herself. Kosma gained enough momentum to slam the spider-bot into a vanguard eliminator, completely destroying its upper body along with her blade.

¬†

""KOSMA, THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING I'VE SEEN YOU DO!"" cheered Jed as he carried her out of the blast zone. She couldn't help but look back at the clustered group of enemies before the cluster shell rained death upon them.¬† The charge from the mortar rounds combined with the rockets in the tubes of the AA battery to create an explosion so massive that the reflective visor of Kosma's suit lowered to protect her eyes,

¬†

""Yep, that's what I was going for,"" Kosma bluffed, not wanting to admit that her blade had gotten stuck in the spider-bot's eye and she was shaking it because she couldn't get it out, the same went for her missile boot, which accidentally went off and sent her spinning out of control. And Jed pretended to believe her.

¬†

""STELLAR JOB KOSMA!"" she heard Kalax say over the radio,

¬†

As she set off to clear the remaining enemies from the position, the troopers had already caught up to her and opened fire on a group of spiders as they rushed the position,

¬†

""I WANT THAT ARTILLERY PIECE CLEARED FROM THE FACE OF IRUX!"" the captain ordered, putting a pair of fingers to the side of his head as he took cover from an incoming mortar barrage. Soon after, a gunship fired a volley of missiles at the mortar-bot, causing it to explode in a blast that knocked down the surrounding trees with its shockwave.

A large group of gunships and air transports, escorted by security drones, approached. They unleashed a dizzying amount of bolt fire and missiles, utterly destroying the few enemy aircraft patrolling the area. Kosma felt relief wash over her as the small fleet landed around them,

¬†

""Cavalry's here, Captain!"" a female soldier's voice, probably the pilot of one of the transports, exclaimed excitedly as a platoon of robot soldiers disembarked from the dropships. As the transports unloaded two heavy tanks, the ground shook as they separated from the aircraft,

¬†

""85 TONS OF NAROKAN ENGINEERING WITH A MINIATURIZED INDARAN PULSE CANNON!"" said Kalax, his fists on his hips, staring proudly at the armored behemoths. Then he wrapped his arms around the shoulders of the troopers originally assigned to drive their APCS,

¬†

""Ladies, we weren't able to assign drivers to the bulwarks, so I guess it's you,"" he explained as the troopers' faces literally lit up, before giving the captain an Indaran salute and rushing to the tanks' hatches,

¬†

""I went out of my way to order them without drivers, I know how those things get attached to their vehicles... let the troopers know and I will skin you alive and turn you into a fur coat to remind me of my days among the organic..."" the captain said in a somber tone, poking his finger into Kosma's chest plate,

¬†

""Awwww.... has a sweet spot!"" said Kosma as she brought her palms to her chest,

¬†

""Hell, I'd have a hot spot for those things too....have you seen her hips!"" she snapped her head at the camera the moment he said that, going so far as to raise the visor on her helmet to make sure he saw her scowl,

¬†

""If I could reach through the screen, I'd knock those stupid glasses right off your face..."" she muttered angrily,

¬†

""Kosma... we both know something completely different would happen if you could reach through the screen,"" Jed replied with a grin that Kosma couldn't see but felt in his voice, making her laugh nervously as she lowered the reflective visor so he wouldn't see her blush,

¬†

A robot with bulkier armor and a distinctive pauldron with the insignia of a planet orbited by two moons, probably indicating his rank as a lieutenant, approached the captain and saluted,

¬†

""Sir, we'll take it from here!"" the lieutenant shouted before turning to bark orders to his platoon to storm the remaining enemy positions.

¬†

Kosma saw a pair of engineers enter the pyramidal structure, and Kalax stopped her from following by extending his arm in front of her,

¬†

""Yes, I know the control room is in there, but if you fire that thing from inside... you won't be able to see the fireworks,"" the captain calmly explained as a broad smile formed on Kosma's face,

""Ohhoho no way.... NO WAY!"" she exclaimed excitedly as the struts along the barrel of the weapon disengaged. The entire structure vibrated as the massive pulse cannon aimed itself at the enemy mothership with a mighty mechanical roar. An amber glow spread through the cannon, emitting a low hum as unfathomable amounts of energy flowed into it, filling the air with static.¬† The captain looked at Kosma, his face projecting a simplified smiling emoticon hologram as he removed his wrist-mounted terminal,

¬†

""Say, do you want to do the honors?"" he said in the friendliest tone she'd ever heard him use, while handing Kosma the wrist terminal, which showed the hologram of a large red button,

¬†

""I DO!"", Kosma grabbed the device and hovered her finger over the button. Climbing onto a wrecked heavy walker to make sure she had the best possible angle, she turned to face the camera and raised the visor,

¬†

""Hey, I couldn't have done this without you... would you like to do the honors?"" said Kosma as a prompt to press the interaction button flashed on the screen,

¬†

""No way, you heard the man, he wants you to do it,"" Jed replied, surprised by Kosma's gesture, knowing how much firing powerful weapons meant to her. He couldn't possibly deny her the chance to fire the mother of all directed energy weapons,

¬†

""We do it at once, when I say fire, we both press it,"" she took a deep breath and looked at the enemy mothership,

¬†

""THREE, TWO, ONE... FIRE!"" they shouted as she placed her finger on the button while Jed placed his on the interaction button. Rings of energy shot from the cannon's body as a sphere of pure energy formed at its tip for a second before unleashing its power. A golden beam of concentrated pulse energy shot from the mighty weapon as it tore through the skies of Irux at the speed of light. Causing a cataclysmic explosion of amber light that split the enemy ship in half and sent it plummeting to the oceans below.

The shockwave from the explosion took a few seconds to reach the island, shaking the leaves of every tree in the jungle and causing Kosma's ears to flap in the wind as she removed her helmet,

¬†

""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,"" Kosma cheered alongside the troopers as the enemy units began to shut down after losing the control signal from the battleship. While the vanguard eliminators were independent enough to function without the control signal, they had no choice but to surrender as they were outnumbered and outgunned by the Sadurian defense forces.

¬†

She took the liberty of stealing a working blade from one of the captured vanguard units and scavenging for some regen-gel to heal her tail before hopping on a gunship to take her back to the control center,

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ was intense, I don‚Äôt know how it looked from the screen but‚Ä¶ damn I felt that shockwave go through me‚Äù, she said while staring at the tropical landscape from the window of the gunship,

¬†

‚ÄúI bet it was way cooler in person, you were incredible back there‚Äù, Jed complimented as he sighed in relief that Kosma was finally safe, when her intercom buzzed to life,

¬†

‚ÄúKosma, land on my carrier in orbit, we have to‚Ä¶‚Äù, Kalax was cut off as Kosma deactivated her intercom, and simply enjoyed the view as they flew her to the landing pad where she had parked her ship,

¬†

‚ÄúJed, if you don‚Äôt mind, I will put off adventures for a few days and relax here‚Ä¶ its beautiful, and all to myself‚Äù, Kosma said as she gave Jed a tired smile,

¬†

‚ÄúAbsolutely, it will be nice to put off the madness for a few days‚Ä¶ or weeks. Didn‚Äôt you say something about stealing food and candles? Maybe we could watch a movie together, I have to show you human science fiction‚Äù, said Jed excited about what she would think,

¬†

""It will be nice not to be torn to pieces for a change... when you get off I will take a looooong shower, raid the cafeteria and tomorrow I will steal a boat and go to the beach!"" she smiled excitedly as she laid out her plan,

¬†

""Sounds great, see you tomorrow Kosma, sorry about... all those deaths,"" Jed replied in a slightly sad tone as Kosma sat at the edge of the landing pad, just like when they came to the comms array,

¬†

""I'd still be having a nervous breakdown on Octanor Station if it wasn't for you, goodbye Jed"", Kosma said and waved at him before Jed closed the game and went on with the rest of his day, but not without taking some time to do some drawings of Kosma's journey in his sketchbook.

After went through some rough MV, an excellent MV like Magnolia brought my passion back. I know it's not even end of January yet but I'm calling it now: Ender Magnolia is my top contender for GOTY

The game is a major improvement in everyway compare to Ender Lilies. Both the look and sound are absolutely incredible. Soundtrack are unique and memorable, just like Lilies, and the art are among the best I've seen, just like Lilies. You were given double jump and dash very early and combined with ability to fast travel from any location make back tracking an absolutely breeze. Map is the biggest improvement as it  is so details and clear, navigating is not a problem in Magnolia. There are hidden places and items of course but the area remains grey and only turn blue once you collected everything so you can't miss anything.

Combat and movement is buttery smooth and incredibly satisfying. 10 differents Homunculus/spirit, each with 3 attacks allows for many different play styles however you like. 

And you can pet the doggo. 10/10 game"

Car is regularly serviced, I‚Äôm at 78k miles and just replaced the battery Feb 2024. It‚Äôs a cx5 GTR 2019.

I am curious if other cx5 owners have had an issue with a dead car after not driving it for a while? 

Is it possible the power is draining from USB cords still plugged in? 

Feb 2024 
Last year went on a trip and left the car sitting in a garage (not heated) for over 18 days. Needed jump start and eventually just replaced the battery out of caution. 

Jan 2025
This year the car was sitting in a heated garage for 17 days and when I tried to start it the dash indicated something about the key fob not being in the car and then the dash was going crazy. My neighbor Jumped it and I drove it for a bit and had to leave it again for another week. 

Jan 2025 (one week later) 
Tried to start it today and same thing that happened last week. Neighbor had to come over again and jump it for me. I drove it for several hours. I don‚Äôt want to replace the battery and I bought an automatic jumper so I don‚Äôt have to bother my poor neighbor again!

Black Widow needs some love,marvelrivals,1i9wf5h,2025-01-25 15:38:44,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i9wf5h/black_widow_needs_some_love/,Ok-Wrongdoer-532,Discussion,"I don't know what they have against black widow 
, but they really did her dirty. I've played around 20 hrs of her so I've really started to break her down and feel merit to speak on what her specific weaknesses are, and possible improvements. I am not a pro player, I'd say my gameplay is what average players would feel about the character if they tried her. While she's not useless and is fun she definitely got pretty much every short end of the stick. No 1 shots, subpar abilities to the rest of the roster, she's just all around weak and has no strengths that someone else couldn't do better.

With her first first ability, ""Edge dancer"" her knock back and stun ability just isn't a great ability for several reasons. First off since she's primarily a sniper class character her knock back just isn't very effective, it's a small boop which can mildy help her create space, but compared to hawkeyed knock back it's very weak.

 Then her actual stun if your in close enough proximity to  land the knock back isn't very good either. It pulls you into the target dazing them, but again in comparison other stuns such as Bucky's that pulls the target in, and lines up his next shot perfectly for easy follow up. Also after her she still has to reload every shot if you are shooting say a diver flanks forcing your stun out but bc it was a surprise attack you couldn't reload and now you have to wait an extra half second for her reload to take a shot which will effectively make the stun useless. Bucky doesn't have this problem I can empty his chamber leave him with no ammo, use his stuns, but he auto reloads during his stun and can follow up immediately with another shot. That to me is ridiculous.

In my opinion I think both abilities should be on their own CD knock back if it's its own CD doesn't need changes, but her stun needs some form of auto reload, bc generally your ganna use the stun defensively to thrawt off flankers so you don't have the time to reload as your actively being assaulted. Make it a skill shot, and maybe increase the stun to a whole second so she can actually reload, and get off her counter attack. ATM the stun is to short if you have a reloaded shot in the chamber it's not bad good skill shot, but naturally you can't reload all the time especially if dove so if they could at least when using the stun give you an auto reload like Bucky that would help still a hard skillshot to land √†s it is least she can have is a shot ready to go.

Her next ability is her ""fleet Foot"" sprint, and leap. It's very similar to Captain America's leading dash, except hers is on a energy meter. Honestly it's one of the best pieces of her kit and makes her extremely fun giving you the potential to make several leaping skill shots B4 you need to recharge energy, or just as an escape option from divers. 

Her primary fire and scope aren't to bad, I would like a faster reload time between each shot when not scoped in. I know she's using a marksmans gun, but they're just really isn't a good reason why she can reload a bit faster when not scoped in, I wouldn't even mind a dmg reduction for speed at that point close range, but the slow reload when not scoped in is criminal even with the headshot she still gets bursted down by pretty much anyone with faster global CDs or fire rate. The scope is fine just land your shots, but the scope itself is right where it needs to be.

Lastly her ultimate, honestly for directs if she charges it up should be a kill, has travel time and it's an ultimate. Then the plasma itself just isn't enough it's in tiny blotches that half the roster can dash out of anyways so it defeats the purpose of the slow. It's not enough plasma definitely needs more. Rng of where the splatter  lands can be terrible to. The ult is just very underwhelming doesn't feel like plasma feels like Elmer's glue.

So yeah she needs buffs 39% W/L on a character in live service is so bad for the game needs to feel less clunky to play, it feels like try to play Sonic 06 just feels mechanically horrible to use.

"After three decades, I finally opened up to my father about how I felt about his anger.",Vent,1i9wd8v,2025-01-25 15:36:20,3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i9wd8v/after_three_decades_i_finally_opened_up_to_my/,BuckFutt993,TW: Anxiety / Depression ,"For context: I'm 31 living with my Dad. My ex and I I lived together for almost 8 years, and the past few years I was living in a cabin in the woods by myself. At first it was alright but as time went on I started getting more depressed always going home to be alone. Unable to find a roommate, I moved back in with my Dad so I can maybe do a reset on my life. I've been there since August and I'm gonna be getting out of there as soon as I can. 

Last night I was eating dinner in the living room, watching TV. Power goes out. Dad yells from his bedroom: ""Motherfucker! Son-of-a-mother-fucking-bitch! 
Five seconds later the power is back on. 
A little later he walks out and asks if the power went out. 
""Yeah,"" I said. ""Is that why you had a temper tantrum?"" (I've been wanting to ask him this for along time but never could. I've been listening to his meltdowns my whole life and these past few months have been unreal). 
He scoffed. ""I wanted to see the thing about the shooting. And when the satellite goes it takes like fifteen fucking minutes for it to come back on.""
He walked into the the kitchen. When he comes back through the living room, I said, ""Hey, I've been wanting to talk to you about something, but I just didn't really no how to bring it up . . ."" 
""What?"" 
""It was traumatizing listening to and seeing your meltdowns when I was a kid. Like when I was seven and you got that bug in your ear at three in the morning and you woke me up because you were throwing and slamming things in the living room. Then (my parents were divorced) we drove to meet my Mom at the gas station with you screaming and cussing and slamming your fist on the dash. It scared the living hell out of me to the point of freezing up (he for some reason has a huge smile on his face) and I went silent from the overwhelming amount of anxiety you made me feel.""
Then he LITERALLY laughs. 
""You know, when I was a kid I got beat by my Dad so many times, and I had my head cut open and bleeding by the time I was nine. I made a promise to myself that if I ever had a kid I wouldn't beat them.""
I wish I would've said: If I ever have a kid I vow to never have a meltdown in front of them. Instead, since I was shocked and hurt, I said, ""It's not a competition for who's life is worse. I've been holding this in for a long time and I couldn't bite my tongue anymore.""
""Robert, I never directed any of that toward you. It's just how I vent when I get frustrated."" 
""Trust me, I know. It's like you are completely unaware of the fact that your meltdowns has an affect on the people around you.""
""Yeah, yeah, everything now-a-days has an affect on everyone."" He started walking back to his bedroom. 
""There's more then one way to deal with obstacles that are challenging.""
""Sorry I'm not perfect,"" he said, shutting his door. 
""I can't believe that's what you got from what I said!""

A lot of great things came from the 1950's. This mentality is not one of them. I've always hated the expression ""respect your elders"". Now I despise it even more. To show someone respect simply because they happened to be born before you (something out of all of our control) makes no sense to me. I should respect the septuagenarian that dedicated their life to torturing innocent animals? Right. My prerequisite for respect is simple. If you're kind, I'm kind. Age is irrelevant.

Given the fact that one can make changes in the 3d world from the astral realm, small it may be, could the ancient deus ex machina be an astral being participating in the 3d world ? Is anyone here familiar with Athenian Myths ? 

The oldest meaning ( older than PIE ) of the word machina / makina means the mother city. It denotes a place, a realm. The mother and the begetter of all. The word gave birth to citizen, civil, civilisation or Kitizen, Kivil, Kivilization if we were to pronounce it as they did back then. It also gave birth to our timeline wherein we were able to become a space probing civilization. 

Put a dash between them like Ma - China and you get Mother China but that it not what it meant. It has nothing to do with the modern country China. It might have something to do with seed or human sem#n to be specific.

So I‚Äôm now going to beat this game on very hard difficulty as Corpo V and want to do this with full arasaka counter intelligence agent roleplay and use only arasaka related gear and tactics and need some help. All act one to Kompeki plaza I finished only by sneaking and throwing daggers, and invest my points to non combat perks like tech for better implants and quick movement, now I‚Äôm lvl 16 and my stats are 7 body/9reflex/3Int/9tech/9cool. How should I build my character for roleplay? 

My build suggest use Arasaka label weapon and gear, so this first mean that I need Arasaka cyberdeck, but could is this make sense if i‚Äôm not a netrunner (as not original Corpo V) and use it only for non combat action like open dors, disable cameras and turrels and distract enemies? How much I need invest to intelligence for this, is basic netrunner perks on 4/9 are enough for that or I need some more?

Next one is Sneak attacks, should I invest points to daggers or switch to silent pistols and sniper riftles? If so, which exactly weapons are arasaka related? All what I know is tamayura of pistols

On tech tree should I invest to tech weapon cause some of them are also made by arasaka (Nekomata, Kenshin, Raiju)? I tried same model of tech smg like Raiju and honestly it looks pretty weak to me

On reflex tree should I put points to Assault riftles/Smg perks or Katanas or just focused on Dash line?

And finally body, I know about adrenaline rush and that health is very important on very hard mode because everyone can kill us very quickly, but is that a mistake I made that ignore intelligence ? Because I used respec one time and can‚Äôt do it anymore, so I don‚Äôt know is this was a good idea.

My originally final stats suggest 15 body / 20 reflex /3 intelligence/ 18 tech/ 20 cool but now I‚Äôm not sure about my choices."

I checked a retro game store here in NYC and their prices are worse. They are selling for $90-130 per game. Rip off!!

So is eBay the best place to get the best deals on used GameCube games? Or is there any other retailer that anyone here can suggest that might have better deals?"
"Spelling, Punctuation, Grammar, and Formatting",deepnightsociety,1i9vsjb,2025-01-25 15:10:43,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i9vsjb/spelling_punctuation_grammar_and_formatting/,honeyinmydreams,,"When you submit a story to the Deepnight Society subreddit, your story must demonstrate a good-faith effort of having correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar, and proper formatting. We understand not all members may have the same English proficiency or abilities, and we are willing to work with you on errors **so long as there is a good-faith effort in doing so.** 

A ""good-faith effort"" simply means that you are earnestly trying your best and that you are at a competent English reading level to meet these standards. 

To provide any writers who need it with some extra help, I've written up a simple guide to SPaG (Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar) and formatting. 

#Starter Advice 

If you are just starting out writing or if you want to improve upon your writing, here are some pieces of general advice: 

1. **Read, read, read!** Reading is the most essential element to learning, well, anything, but especially writing! 

2. **Use a text editor to write your drafts.** It's not advised to write directly in a Reddit post for multiple reasons. The most important being that you may not be able to save it, in case it gets deleted or your app/browser reloads in the middle of writing. With a text editor (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs), most of them provide an auto-save feature, you can leave where you are and come back to it later, you can access older versions, etc. Text editors also usually come with many features such as spell check, word count, and more. 

#Spelling 

Assistance with spelling is very accessible in this day and age. As I stated above, it's best to write your drafts in a text editor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, as these editors provide many built-in tools such as spell check and word count. If for some reason you cannot access these or you want to be doubly sure, you can stick your draft into a website like Grammarly, which will do all the SPaG checking for you. When in doubt, just copy and paste the word into your favorite search engine and find the correct spelling that way. 

#Punctuation 

| What it looks like | What it's called | What it's for |
|:----------------|:----------------:|------------:|
| . | period / full stop | end a sentence or abbreviate a word |
| , | comma | create a separation or pause between words or sentences |
| ! | exclamation point | end a sentence with exclamation (excitement, yelling, urgency) |
| ? | question mark | end a sentence with inquiry (questioning) 
| ; | semicolon | link two closely related sentences |
| : | colon | to introduce something that illustrates the clause before the colon |
| ... | ellipsis | indicates a pause or trailing off in speech |
| ' | apostrophe | indicates possession (""the girl's book"") or a contraction (you're = you are) |
| "" | quotation mark | indicates that someone is speaking; also used for titles or indirect quotations |
| - | hyphen | used to connect two or more words, or separate words into syllables |
| ‚Äì | dash | used to separate an element or idea within a sentence |
| () | parentheses | uses to set apart clarifying elements or asides |

See more [here](https://www.grammarly.com/punctuation).

#Grammar 

Grammar is a dense and varied subject in comparison to spelling and punctuation. Grammar covers the rules of how language works. Instead of writing up a super long guide here, allow me to link you to a variety of free resources from Grammarly that go over some important concepts: 

[Common mistakes ](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/grammar/30-grammar-mistakes-writers-should-avoid/) /
[Key concepts](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/grammar/definitions-of-key-grammar-concepts/) / 
[Run on sentences](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/sentences/run-on-sentence-basics/) /
[Syntax](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/grammar/syntax/) /
[Sentence structure](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/sentences/sentence-structure/)

#Formatting 

When it comes to formatting, we expect the majority of stories to follow a basic short story format. Since this is Reddit, and our writers are not delivering manuscripts to publishers, some common pieces of advice can be disregarded (such as font size and indentation). What we do expect, at the very least: 

1. **Proper spacing.** For readability, please double space line breaks. Reddit will ignore single line breaks unless you put a back slash, and it's advised you leave an extra space between line breaks regardless. 

2. **Correct use of bold, italics, and other rich text.** There is a general guide [here](https://www.maine.edu/content-management/writing-style-guide/emphasis/) on when to use these elements. For all intents and purposes, we simply ask that you don't overuse rich text in order to maintain readability. 

3. **Paragraphs.** The number of sentences in a paragraph is anywhere between three and ten, depending on the writer's style and the content itself. A good rule of thumb is to separate paragraphs by ideas. When a scene or perspective changes, that's usually a good time to break up the paragraph. When someone begins speaking, you should separate the paragraph and start a new line. 

4. **Quotations/Dialogue.** When someone begins speaking, it is recommended to start a new line for each time the speaker changes. It should be clear who is speaking without having to introduce the character every time. 

5. **Capitalization.** In line with our rules on SPaG, please make sure to capitalize properly. And please do not overuse capitalization. 

For a full and up-to-date guide on how to format text on Reddit, you can go [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043033952-Formatting-Guide).

#Exceptions 

For all of these rules, exceptions may be made for ""in-universe"" literary devices (known as ""external deviations"") at the discretion of the mod team. Sometimes stories may deviate from the usual SPaG/F for narrative purposes. An example of this would be [""House of Leaves""](https://www.knowledgelost.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/617248_337175679713675_1178480927_o.jpg) by Mark Z. Danielewski. Other times, stories might include an excerpt from another text that does not have proper SPaG/F, such as a text message, a letter, a document, etc. In any such case, we expect that stories will follow standard SPaG/F for the regular bulk of the text. 

You may inquire with the mod team on specifications at any time."
Friendly reminder to turn off your high beams on the highway.,driving,1i9vrm6,2025-01-25 15:09:37,32,0.83,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/driving/comments/1i9vrm6/friendly_reminder_to_turn_off_your_high_beams_on/,BallerDung,,"The high beam symbol is a blue lamp. If you have this symbol on your dash, that means you are a hazard on the road.

The only situation where it‚Äôs acceptable to have this on is if there are no cars in front of you, no oncoming traffic on the other side of the road, and there are very little lights to illuminate the road.

The other day I was driving at night on the BQE. There was a car with their high beams on driving right behind me and I need to merge. Problem is that the high beams reflect off my side mirrors and I literally could not see anything from my mirrors. That is a hazard. I had to rely on just my shoulder checks and blind spot detectors to merge.

The highway is already so well lit that your low beams should be enough. I assume some of those people simply do not know how to turn off the high beams."

I‚Äôve had my dog, Coco since moments after she was born. She was rejected by her mother, and I hand raised her. She‚Äôs always been very sassy and stubborn, always top dog in the house, but she was ALWAYS sweet and affectionate with every human she encountered. In late summer our 18 year old terrier mix, Toto was euthanized, at home. He had been ill and declining for a long time, and was ready. Since then, her behavior has changed completely. Coco was present, and after he had passed we all took some time to sit with him. Coco seemed agitated at first, but when we all got up from sitting with him, she went and laid down right up against him, snuggling against him in a way she never had when he was alive. Over the next few days I would wonder where she was, and discover her sitting on the deck in the spot where he passed, looking lost. It was heart breaking. She started declining herself, not sleeping, having intense separation anxiety, wanting to be held all the time, losing weight. After a couple of vet appointments we discovered she has liver disease. I have finally found a feeding schedule and food that seems to be tolerated, and she‚Äôs putting a bit of weight back on. She‚Äôs sleeping, she‚Äôs got some pep back in her step. Emotionally though, she‚Äôs a mess. I‚Äôve been taking her with me when I leave the house, because she just cries, and then listens for me over and over again if I don‚Äôt. She goes to the office with me, running errands, etc. I try to make it as fun as possible for her, stopping to walk in fields and check out nature trails and stuff, but she‚Äôs still waiting in the car for me if I go get groceries or have coffee with a friend and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs great for her. At the office she‚Äôs adored, but she has become a wild card to the point where I don‚Äôt let people get too close. She‚Äôll growl most of the time now. She‚Äôll actually get excited to see everyone, approach a coworker for pets, push into the petting, but be growling at the same time. 

My husband and stepdaughter are both heartbroken. They used to cuddle and snuggle with Coco, but now she‚Äôs growly with them, and snappy with my husband in particular. He jokes that she‚Äôs ‚Äúclosed her circle‚Äù to the point where it‚Äôs just me. 

My untrained, gut-driven guess is that she‚Äôs terribly insecure, and since she‚Äôs lost her companion, who was the bottom dog, she‚Äôs trying to make sure SHE‚ÄôS not the bottom dog. 

As far as the separation anxiety, In not sure. I‚Äôm the only constant in her life - I got divorced and my ex did not stay in touch. My daughter took the cat and moved out. I‚Äôm the only one who hasn‚Äôt disappeared. (Not sure if that‚Äôs even a dog thing.) Maybe she‚Äôs afraid I‚Äôll disappear too?

She‚Äôs got pretty significant age-related sight impairment as well. 

I could be way off base, and even if I‚Äôm not, I have no idea how to start making things better for her. If anyone has any suggestions I would be so grateful. I love this dog with all my heart, and this has been such a rough few months - losing Toto and then watching her suffer. 

Info: I give her Denamarin for her liver, and Purina Calming Care probiotic, which our vet recommended. She said it can take 1 - 2 months to see any benefit, and it‚Äôs only been about a week. Her food is Zignature canned kangaroo formula. I give her about a melon-ball sized portion every two hours while she‚Äôs awake, garnished with a dash of organic baby food (pur√©ed apple and sweet potato usually), the probiotic and a bit of psyllium fiber.

I wonder if those who sealed it simply prayed for a lack, or were unaware, of our ability to detect neutrinos. None pass through this precise point in space. I wonder also: have those who sealed this here found some way to undetectably replace half a mountain's worth of a tunnel behind them, or did they truly seal this object away in the distance of past suggested by all known geological understanding?

They left a single inscription. It invokes reminiscence of those tombs of pre-fusion waste back on the planet whence my own species came. With a dash of poetry for coherence, and because its circumstance of discovery calls for it, my best attempt at translation for the poorly understood Precursor language is thus:

""Those who know the sound of the alarm answer its call. And so I (we?) say to you: what will you be doing today (now)?"""

AIO for feeling off about not being invited to my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday lunch with his mom,AmIOverreacting,1i9vlto,2025-01-25 15:02:29,3,0.72,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i9vlto/aio_for_feeling_off_about_not_being_invited_to_my/,ubi_amor_ibi_dolor,üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶family/in-laws,"TLDR: My adult boyfriend‚Äôs mom is having a birthday lunch for him and I‚Äôm not invited. Meanwhile, my infant son is attending and we also had a family lunch the week prior to celebrate the birthday. Is this weird? AIO because I feel some type of way (bummed? I can‚Äôt explain the feeling) for being excluded? 

For some context to lead up to the question here: My (30 f) bf (39 m) and I have been dating for a year and a half. We have a child together who is just a few months old (yes, your math is correct. We got pregnant early into the relationship). He is the youngest of 3. No, he is NOT a ‚Äúmama‚Äôs boy‚Äù and she does not seem to be a ‚Äúboy mom.‚Äù Because he had been single for awhile and entering his late 30‚Äôs, his mom did not think he would have a child. I entered the picture and surprise! She and his sister were elated. My relationship with my boyfriend‚Äôs mother is good. She seems to like me. 

Every year his mom has a dinner with each of her children on their birthday. When I first started dating my boyfriend I didn‚Äôt think much about not being included. His birthday was just a few months into our relationship and considering he had been single for several years prior it was maybe more of a habit not think to include me. Again, at the time I didn‚Äôt think much about it. If anything I thought, ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs sweet of him to have a nice relationship with his mom.‚Äù 

This year she said she wanted to have a family lunch to celebrate all the birthdays of that month - hers, her husband‚Äôs and my boyfriend‚Äôs. I was included in this lunch - We packed up our baby and drove an hour to come to them and they were 20+ minutes late. However, no one really talked to me much so I spent the whole lunch talking to his 10 year old niece. I figured ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm sitting at the end of the table so maybe it‚Äôs the seating that doesn‚Äôt make it very easy for the rest to talk to me.‚Äù His mother did talk to me at the very end briefly so I could take her picture with my boyfriend and my son.

Now this is where I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting (and honestly not sure of how to describe my feelings about it in general) - she then arranged for ANOTHER birthday lunch for the following Saturday (yay- another disrupted Saturday) for just her and my boyfriend. I‚Äôm not invited. 

The night before I called a friend of mine to ask her opinion about it since my mom had mentioned that she thought it was weird. My friend agreed and told me that it seems like his family is only nice to me to keep access open to my son. She then was like ‚Äúwell, you can have your boyfriend take the baby with him so you can have some baby free time or another thought is to not allow your child to go where you are not invited to go.‚Äù It had been a very challenging Friday (I work full time from home AND watch the baby alone for 12 hours due to our work schedules and living arrangement) - the baby wasn‚Äôt eating or napping much etc etc. So I asked my boyfriend if he is taking our son and he said he would if I was ok with it. I decided it was since I did need a bit of a break (although I usually do get a break when I‚Äôm done with work and on the weekends since my boyfriend takes over care). Although, I was reluctant since these outings are often made without any consideration that we have an infant who has a feeding and napping schedule. 

I did have a conversation about if she eats alone with his siblings on their birthday and if their spouses and children are ever invited/attend. He said it‚Äôs usually just them and this individual lunch came about since it was hard to arrange for all family members to be in attendance at the same time. I then followed up with why there was another lunch if the family lunch was already celebrating the birthdays and everyone was there? He said he doesn‚Äôt know. 

Today, we spent the morning watching a show and then he went to get dressed to have lunch with his mom. He then played with the baby and got him dressed. His mom called that she was going to be 30+ minutes late. She was going to meet him at the house and then they would ride together to the restaurant. I decided I would just go take a shower since I started to feel awkward about the whole thing. Like, should I have just been sitting on the couch in my pajamas (since I live here!) and waving them goodbye as I sit alone?? His mother arrived when I was in the shower and my boyfriend let me know they were leaving. 

Now I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about being excluded. I didn‚Äôt think I would be upset but I‚Äôm not really looking forward to ordering food and eating lunch by myself especially given our schedules don‚Äôt even allow for us to have lunch or dinner together during the week. I think maybe I feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äújust the girlfriend,‚Äù and almost like just the ‚Äúvessel‚Äù that carried her grandchild and made her beloved son a father. I also don‚Äôt know if this is totally a normal thing to do. I was raised by a single mother who is maternal but in a different way other than the typical motherly image and I‚Äôm an only child (I bring this up because maybe I have a different example of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù than he does). I have a son now so is this normal mother son behavior? Am I going to want a lunch with just him? 

Either way I‚Äôm not sure how to describe how I feel but part of me doesn‚Äôt want to be at the house just eating my door dash alone while waiting for their return but I feel too bummed to drive anywhere. My feelings just really started as the day went on so I didn‚Äôt have time to discuss it with my boyfriend but also I just don‚Äôt even know how or what I would say since I don‚Äôt know if this is normal, I can‚Äôt pinpoint words to describe what I feel and I am a few months postpartum so maybe I‚Äôm being hormonal?

Repulsor Metamorphosis,CTsandbox,1i9v9vq,2025-01-25 14:47:48,4,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/1i9v9vq/repulsor_metamorphosis/,Zealousideal_Lab8117,Cursed technique ,"This technique allows the user to transform parts of their body into CE-fueled repulsion engines. These engines generate powerful bursts of force and momentum, allowing for enhanced speed, flight-like movement, and devastating shockwave-based attacks. The repulsion force can be focused through specific limbs, such as the hands, feet, or even the back, to propel the user in any direction or launch high-impact strikes that amplify physical force. Unlike traditional energy blasts, these engines work by expelling CE in bursts that create repulsive force, pushing against the surrounding environment or the user‚Äôs own body.

The user can activate repulsor engines in their arms or legs to deliver explosive punches and kicks, generating enough kinetic energy to shatter defenses and send opponents flying. By activating engines on their back or feet, the user can achieve extreme aerial maneuverability, dashing through the air at high speeds while adjusting their trajectory mid-flight. Additionally, the technique can generate continuous shockwaves around the body for defensive purposes, repelling incoming projectiles or enemies with an outward blast of force.

The repulsor engines are not limited to propulsion alone; they can also be used to create destructive pressure fields. By releasing CE in rapid, concentrated bursts, the user can generate localized gravitational pushes that distort space around them, repelling everything within a certain radius. This makes it possible to neutralize melee attacks or even redirect energy-based techniques by overwhelming their momentum with repulsive force.




The technique‚Äôs power depends on how much CE is channeled into the repulsor engines. Simple propulsion requires minimal energy, but generating high-speed flight or powerful repulsive bursts consumes significantly more CE, quickly depleting reserves if overused. The intense kinetic recoil from repulsor-enhanced attacks places tremendous strain on the user‚Äôs muscles, bones, and joints. Continuous use without proper control can cause severe injuries, such as torn ligaments, fractures, or internal damage.

Activating the engines requires precise timing and CE manipulation. Misjudging the force output or direction can lead to unintended collisions or loss of control, leaving the user vulnerable. Each activation of a repulsor engine produces force in a single, linear direction. Rapid adjustments require multiple bursts, making it difficult to maintain stability in crowded or unpredictable environments.

If too much CE is released in a single burst, the repulsor engine may explode with destructive force, damaging the user as well as their surroundings. This risk increases when using full-body propulsion or attempting large-scale shockwave generation. Techniques that can absorb kinetic energy or CE greatly reduce the effectiveness of this technique, as they counter the outward blasts of repulsion directly.





Extension Techniques:


Blast Step: Propels the user forward with a short, high-speed burst, enabling rapid dashes that leave afterimages to confuse enemies.

Breakthrough Fist: Enhances a punch with a concentrated repulsor engine burst, delivering an impact that creates a shockwave upon contact, capable of shattering barriers.

Repulsion Overdrive: Charges the repulsor engines for a continuous burst of CE, allowing for sustained propulsion rather than short bursts.

Concussive Palm: Generates a wide-area shockwave from the user‚Äôs palms, sending multiple enemies flying in a cone-shaped blast.





Cursed Technique Reversal:


Compression Engines: The user generates inward-pulling forces instead of outward blasts. This allows them to pull enemies or objects toward themselves at high speeds, enabling devastating close-range grapples or compression-based attacks. For example, pulling an enemy into a compression punch concentrates kinetic energy into a single point for bone-crushing force.





Domain Expansion:


Endless Recoil: The domain manifests as a massive, mechanical expanse filled with rotating repulsor engines.


Every action within the domain is subjected to continuous bursts of repulsion, pushing enemies away from the user and destabilizing their movements. The user‚Äôs repulsor engines operate at peak efficiency, allowing for limitless bursts of propulsion without energy drain for the duration of the domain.

All physical strikes or movements within the domain generate secondary shockwaves, making even minor actions produce destructive force. The user can create localized repulsion fields that push objects or enemies into spiraling trajectories, disorienting them and rendering their attacks ineffective.

Opponents are trapped in an inescapable vortex of kinetic force, continuously pushed, bounced, and thrown around the domain until it ends."

Eternal Bond lasts for 20s and consists of 4 dashes of 15m each. Provides 220h/s (stacks up) and 30d/s (does not stack up). Is this correct?

I sometimes apply debuff (Terror Cape) and then do dashes staying in the Cloak form to deal some damage or to escape.

I only see this as a defensive ult when we are trying to defend a choke and my healing is not enough (I often find myself as the only healer in the match).

Normally I don't struggle with this character, I do most of the healing and most of the assists throughout the match. My choice for support in OW was often Moira, so it feels very familiar.

Lets be honest, we all use the app while driving.... You basically have to. Its just not designed for it at all. Even sitting still the buttons are small and UI unintuitive, but like, pushing the .5mm ""re-center"" button on the directions map is near impossible on the move.  


\_\_\_\_\_\_The rest of this is just ranting. You can back out here. \_\_\_\_\_\_

  
Also sometimes the GPS doesn't show the address when im approaching, especially if they have a long driveway. The ADDRESS should ALWAYS be visible. You pull up the order information and its in 8pt font. I have a rather large phone i can imagine other people with 1"" less of a screen... Considering the logistics of getting a tablet just to run the DD app hotspotted to my phone.  
  
So much about this app drives me batty, like not being able to see your delivery address while waiting on pickup confirmation so you can see where you are going and plan a route. Why exactly?   
  
3 different settings menus located in 2 different places. 

Sometimes i can get to the ""text the customer"" easily, sometimes i cant find it anywhere or its buried 3 clicks deep.

1 click accepts an order but you need 2 to decline. (or just let it time out which i usually do while driving) Ill never forget the time pulling it out of my pocket mistakenly clicked and accepted the 12 mile 6$ payout that took me 30 minutes out of my zone. I have yet to unassign an order and have no idea how (ive looked). they make it very hard to find (on purpose) You should get a short grace period to unassign. and 30 seconds to accept? sometimes it just not enough esp with the shopping orders.

I could make another whole post on the bugs and clunk with the ""shopping"" orders (and i have)  
  
The contactless delivery forces you to call the customer, take a picture AND write in a description. Also some choices you cannot back out of for no real reason. I boot up the camera to take a picture of the drop off location and the customer opens the door, so i hand it to them and they walk away before i snap the photo, well you cant go back and select ""handed to customer"" you just have to take a picture of ""whatever"" to let you continue. Also when shopping ill often get locked into a screen with substitutions.

Yes, we do the photos probably more for the dasher protection than the customers but maybe like after ive done 500+ delivery's can i just be trusted and maybe forgo the photos? It does take time it adds up and its annoying.

I know this is a bridge WAY too far, but maybe let dashers set filters. Only x$ per mile, only x distance ect for the dash. I know this would go against everything DD stands for but some nights i only want to take bangers and i feel like i miss out on them sorting through all the obvious trash noone will take. The dread of a missclick. I would love to have the possibility of gold or plat status if i hustled but its like they intentionally make it impossible with sub .50 cents per mile offers NOONE is taking."

I currently have a 2020 Corsa F which I got on PCP in 2021; as of this March I will have had it about 3 years, I'm thinking of trading it in for a 2024 Mazda 2 (1.5L Skyactiv G-75 Centerline).

The Corsa was not as reliable as I would have liked (electrical faults and phantom errors on dash, then I pay ¬£100 to get told its nothing) with a full service every year. I feel like I'm one dodgy bump away from the next issue when driving it. Ive seen the Mazda and have a plan to buy, I've looked and online the reliability is good across the board, the main downsides being boot space and low engine power; which aren't deal breakers for me.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience or advice with either of these cars ?

Cheers

***Memory transcription subject: Indali, Krakotl Business Student (First Term) White Hill University***

*Date [standardized human time]: December 11th, 2136*

If interest for The Flaming Paws had been the day side of Venlil prime, it had suddenly changed poles.

Bar owners that once seemed eager, or at least willing, to have us perform changed their flight path in an instant. Reaching out to them, I was met with a glide against the wind at best, and an outright thunderstorm at worst. For some reason or another, I just couldn't get a *yes* out of anyone. Any and all progress I'd made with the various venues around White Hill had disintegrated seemingly without any rhyme or reason, and it had all happened so fast!

> We‚Äôve been making some changes to our band scheduling. We will let you know when a slot opens up.

*You said you had plenty of slots open last time.*

> Unfortunately, we‚Äôre not taking new performers at this time.

*You reached out to me first!*

> We are no longer interested.

*At least this one is brutally honest, but could you at least mention why?*

The strangest part was that, not only were they all pulling out, they wouldn‚Äôt give me any kind of *justification*. Even when I asked, they would just double down on their decision, using any wording they could come up with to provide my question with no real answer. It was all so‚Ä¶bizarre.

I'd speculated, at first, that it maybe had something to do with the previous show. But that didn't seem right. The crowd had only grown steadily the longer the band was on stage. I couldn't imagine the performance leaving anyone feeling wary.

Then I considered the interruption of the raid siren. Maybe we'd been associated with that for some crazy reason? That felt just as unlikely though. Soldt had only acted grateful to Wes for taking charge of the situation. Any possibility of a stampede was stamped out as quickly as it could form.

So, left with no hypothesis that held up, I decided to just call Soldt herself. We‚Äôd already performed at The Sun's Harvest, so she knew exactly what The Flaming Paws were about. She‚Äôd seemed so happy to have us there. Yet, even after all that, she‚Äôd gone completely silent on me! Just like all the others, negotiation was impossible. She wasn't even answering my messages.

My first call to her went unanswered, so I waited a bit and gave her another ring. It was the same thing the second time‚Ä¶and the third‚Ä¶and the fourth‚Ä¶

I finally decided to just go to the bar directly. Maybe then I could at least figure out why she wasn‚Äôt responding. I‚Äôd always been taught to show some resilience when things weren't going my way. After all, what was the point of making such thorough plans if they were to fall through at the first hiccup? Sometimes, a businesswoman had to put on the pressure to get what she needed.

Entering The Sun's Harvest before the rush, there weren't a whole lot of patrons mulling about yet. Those that *were* there didn't seem to acknowledge my presence, a breath of fresh air after having received so many *looks* following Cilany's broadcast.

There was one person that took notice of me, however. Soldt‚Äôs ears swiveled towards me before she quickly dashed into the back room.

*Hiding from me? Seriously?*

Doing my best to shake off the absurdity of the situation, I approached the bar, hopping up on a nearby stool, and flagging down one of the tenders. The nearest of them meandered over, giving a short wag of their tail.

‚ÄúWhat can I get you?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, I‚Äôd like to speak to Soldt if she‚Äôs available. I‚Äôm here on business.‚Äù

The worker turned an eye towards the door to the back room, looking warily, then flicked their ears negative.

‚ÄúSorry, Soldt‚Äôs preoccupied this paw. You can leave her a message and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll get back to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI *have* left a message,‚Äù I leaned in a bit, prompting the bartender to take an equivalent step backwards. ‚ÄúHaving not received any response, I figured I‚Äôd see if I could speak with her in person.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶I-I‚Äôm terribly sorry. She can‚Äôt see you this paw.‚Äù

I could tell they weren‚Äôt going to budge on this. They were probably told to deflect in case one of us came in. That meant I still didn‚Äôt have any answers! All I wanted was some kind of *reason* for all this runaround! Why did every bar in the area spontaneously decide to cast us to the side? It just made no sense! We didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, did we?

Defeated, I slumped down from the stool and made my way back outside. I clearly wasn‚Äôt going to get anywhere just talking to the bartender.

*Still, I came all this way to have my questions answered, and so far I have nothing! I‚Äôm not about to just leave, not when I‚Äôm still no closer to solving this mystery. What‚Äôs the point of even having the band if no venues let us play?*

I slipped around the back of the building, looking for an employee entrance. Luckily, it was clearly marked, but locked from the outside. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt be able to just walk right in. There was a badge scanner meant to only grant access to the workers.

I gave a quiet, frustrated squawk and started to sulk away, but an idea crossed my mind.

Approaching the door, I knocked my talons against it a few times, hoping the sound would pass for a Venlil paw. Then, with my best impression of the bartender I‚Äôd spoken to, I shouted through the wood.

‚ÄúHey, Soldt, I left my badge inside! Can you let me in?‚Äù

I had no idea if it would actually work. It would only take Soldt looking out into the bar to see her worker diligently taking orders. Not to mention it made no sense for them not to have crossed paths in the back room if the worker came behind the building. Why exit from the front just to go to the back? Still, it was worth a shot. I just had to hope that my trick would work.

After what felt like an eternity waiting, I heard Soldt on the other side of the door.

‚ÄúHonestly, you really need to keep tabs on that badge. We have the secure door for a reason-‚Äù

As she opened the door for me, her eyes went wide and she faltered backwards a moment with a startled bleat. Before she could think to close it on my face, I pressed myself inside. It was an extreme measure, but I wasn‚Äôt leaving without answers!

‚ÄúAlright, Soldt, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúIndali! I, err‚Ä¶I was meaning to call you back, but I‚Äôve been busy with the books, so-‚Äù

‚ÄúPredator-shit. Every venue in the area collectively decided they want nothing to do with us, and *no one* is telling me *why*. I‚Äôm sorry for forcing my way in, truly, but I‚Äôm just trying to do right by my band! This is something they‚Äôve been working hard for, and I‚Äôm just watching all of our opportunities vanish in a flash! Please, just tell me what happened.‚Äù

Soldt‚Äôs face turned from one of panic to one of sympathy. Heaving a sigh, they motioned over to some chairs for us to sit down. I obliged, taking a seat across from her.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù she began, ‚ÄúI really did like your performance. It was awesome, and I would love to have you back again, but‚Ä¶well it‚Äôs not really my choice at this point.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I queried.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to say anything to you, so don‚Äôt go dropping my name anywhere, but all of the local groups that we and the other bars tend to book decided to put you on a blacklist of theirs.‚Äù

‚ÄúA blacklist?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt perform at any venue you perform at. Frankly, I think it‚Äôs petty as all get out, and I‚Äôve never seen them do anything like this before with startup groups. But they were fiirm on it, and they had enough unity to throw their weight around.‚Äù

*Why would they be so worried about us playing?*

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going along with it?‚Äù my voice gained a more accusatory tone. ‚ÄúYou just admitted it‚Äôs rotten! How can you just let them get away with that? Don‚Äôt the bars have pull too?‚Äù

‚ÄúI *tried* to vouch for you to the other bars, but they‚Äôre all too concerned with playing it safe, going with what they know. They don‚Äôt want to make enemies out of the bands that they‚Äôve had perform before, so they don‚Äôt mind forgoing your group. If I book you myself, then *I‚Äôm* going to be paying the price! We literally advertise having live music here every paw, and I know your band can‚Äôt fill all those spaces alone. I seem to recall you had trouble synchronizing your schedules just for the last show.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt wrong. We‚Äôd barely found the opportunity to come together when we did. School schedules made everything a little tricky. There was no way we could play here every paw.

‚ÄúI guess I understand your reasoning now,‚Äù my wings drooped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still ridiculous though. What‚Äôs their problem with us anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeats me,‚Äù Soldt replied. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to ask one of the bands. Purple Ray would probably be the best one to question. They‚Äôre the ones that saw you live, so it was probably their idea to rally everyone against you. Just, uh, please don‚Äôt tell them that I told you all this. I seriously can‚Äôt afford to lose all that talent. I‚Äôll keep trying to convince the other venues to disregard the blacklist, but that‚Äôs really all I can do without huffing the proverbial stinkreed. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶thanks for telling me anyway,‚Äù I got up to leave. ‚ÄúSorry for putting you on the spot, I guess. And for impersonating your worker. I just couldn‚Äôt stand to walk away with no answers. It was driving me crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm sorry for avoiding you,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to lose these guys, ya know? What they‚Äôre doing is stupid, but they‚Äôve also been doing this for a long time. They‚Äôve got‚Ä¶tenure, I guess? It doesn‚Äôt sit right to cast them all aside for some up-and-coming band that I‚Äôve only seen play once.‚Äù

I turned an eye to face her directly.

‚ÄúIf you want my honest opinion, it‚Äôs not worth making deals with dishonest people like that. Still, I appreciate you coming clean with me. I won‚Äôt bring you up when I speak to them. Hopefully, we can play here again some time soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that,‚Äù Soldt replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry about all this.‚Äù

Leaving out the back door, the thrum of the building faded away, and I was left to process what I‚Äôd been told. For some reason, those Purple Ray guys had it out for us, and they‚Äôd managed to get all the other musicians to form a union just to keep us out of the scene! It all seemed unreal, like some kind of cosmic joke.

*I‚Äôll have to talk to them. Somehow, I need to get them to drop the blacklist.‚Äù

Checking my pad, I realized just how much time I‚Äôd spent on this endeavor. Finding Purple Ray would have to wait. I‚Äôd already scheduled another affair. Surprisingly, Lanyd had extended an invitation to join her for a girls‚Äô claw out. Apparently, one of her friends had organized it and told her to bring whoever she wanted. Lanyd, despite stammering over half her words, was adamant that I come along.

*She‚Äôs reaching out to get to know me better. I suppose we‚Äôre still a little unfamiliar with each other. Even that tour we gave was a bit of a dysfunctional mess. If she wants to spend more time together, I‚Äôm more than happy to do so. She seems very sweet. There‚Äôs no reason not to tag along.*

With that, I started heading back to my dorm to get ready.

*Date [standardized human time]: December 11th, 2136*

The hall leading up to Enlek‚Äôs office was empty, and his door was wide open. I‚Äôd finally found the time to see him outside of class, though I didn‚Äôt really know what to think about it. I‚Äôd definitely had my suspicions given how he responded to my emails, and Tenseli felt the same way. Something told me that he wouldn‚Äôt be happy to see me walk in.

Not like that ever stopped me before.

I knew it would be an uphill run the moment I left Leirn, but that was the entire point. The whole purpose of coming here, of attending White Hill, was to get my education without any asterisks. I wasn‚Äôt just going to be the second chair Yotul doctor that could hardly work a computer. There would be no reason for anyone to doubt my skills. I was learning along with everyone else, here on Venlil Prime.

Steeling myself, I turned through the doorframe and stepped into Enlek‚Äôs office.

The old Venlil‚Äôs ears turned towards me, and his head tilted slightly from what he was reading on his monitor. Then it all fell back into place without hardly a reaction shown.

‚ÄúI figured you‚Äôd be here sooner,‚Äù his voice sounded disinterested. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve watched your grades slowly slip. Figured you‚Äôd be eager for some guidance.‚Äù

‚ÄúI had some prior obligations, giving campus tours for arriving Humans,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not all, is it?‚Äù he asked, once more putting an eye directly on me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the frequency of new arrivals experience a sharp decline.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I shuffled nervously. ‚ÄúThere were some other things as well. I‚Äôm here now though! Ready to get caught up!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, you‚Äôve certainly fallen behind. You‚Äôve at least outlasted the ones that dropped the class. There‚Äôs always a few in the first herd of paws that run at the first struggle. Of those that remain, however, your grades are among the worst.‚Äù

Enlek was brutally honest as expected. The old bastard was so cold, it was a wonder he‚Äôd made it to such an age without getting screened for predator disease. I supposed that good credentials could stave off the accusations pretty damn well.

‚ÄúWith all due respect, sir, I did reach out to you for clarification over email a few times,‚Äù I tried to keep the bitterness out of my voice, ‚Äúbut your replies were awfully short in comparison to what you sent back to Tenseli.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou both study together, yes? Certainly he can explain the concepts.‚Äù

*That‚Äôs hardly the point!*

‚ÄúWe study independently as well, sir. I‚Äôd prefer to receive more thorough instruction in the future.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôll keep it in mind. What have you come here for this paw specifically?‚Äù

I slid into the seat across from him and dug my pad out of my bag. Swiping my paw across the screen, I navigated to the virtual book, Finding the part I‚Äôd bookmarked before.

‚ÄúI was a little confused with chapter nine,‚Äù I turned the pad so Enlek could see. ‚ÄúSpecifically, the part about metallic bonding in the blood seems‚Ä¶inconsistent? The table doesn‚Äôt really line up with the text exactly. What are these exceptions about? Why are they there?‚Äù

Enlek grunted and finally actually swiveled his chair away from his computer.

‚ÄúI covered this in class,‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too focused on the metallic components. These compounds can react with other substances as well. The base of blood can be a useful rule, but there are always exceptions given the other components.‚Äù

Now that he mentioned it, I did recall him bringing that up in class. At the time, however, I‚Äôd been trying to catch up on homework‚Ä¶and a little preoccupied thinking of a song the band had been practicing.

*I really should be more focused during lectures‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúThat makes sense. Honestly, I should have thought of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you *should* have paid attention when I explained it the first time,‚Äù Enlek sighed. ‚ÄúYou will find it difficult to make progress if you must learn everything twice.‚Äù

I paused. Enlek being dismissive was something I expected. I‚Äôd heard the ‚Äòprimitive‚Äô comments enough times to see it coming. What I wasn‚Äôt ready for was this outright bitterness. Something told me that he thought this session was even worse than just a waste of his time.

‚ÄúSorry, professor,‚Äù I shifted gears. ‚ÄúHave I made some sort of major error here? I feel as though I‚Äôve been at odds with you since the term began. I‚Äôm not sure if I did something to cause you to think less of me, but I‚Äôd like to mend it now‚Ä¶if that‚Äôs a possibility.‚Äù

I was doing my best to sound cordial, but the feeling of unease settled over me as soon as I‚Äôd spoken those words. My muscles were tense, and I could tell I was walking between brambles. Enlek paused at my question, then leaned back in his seat.

‚ÄúYou want to practice medicine. That‚Äôs the only reason anyone takes this class.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat means the health of others is on the line. They rely on medical professionals to set them on the path of healing and recovery, or to save them during emergencies. The difference in skill and education between two paramedics could be the difference in someone living and dying. As an instructor, it is my responsibility to make sure that only those *deserving* make it beyond this point. I owe it to all their future patients.‚Äù

*Ah, I see. Yeah, I hear you loud and fucking clear.*

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù I rose from my seat, stuffing my pad back into my bag. ‚ÄúWell, I suppose that‚Äôs up to me then, isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôll make sure to pay attention in class a little more closely. Thanks for the *help* you offered, and have a paw as pleasant as yourself.‚Äù

I strode out of his office before he could reply, though I doubted he had much more to say.

*So he doesn't think I deserve it. No secret as to why. Whatever. It doesn‚Äôt matter. This is why I came to White Hill anyway. I‚Äôll just have to show him how capable I can be. I‚Äôll pass this class with or without his help.*

***Memory transcription subject: Lanyd, Venlil Music Student (Second Term) White Hill University***

*Date [standardized human time]: December 11th, 2136*

I waited outside the entrance of The Night Side bar, scanning the passing people for Indali‚Äôs approach. Standing in a place with such high traffic, I felt even more exposed than usual, and it was a little difficult to keep my composure. It wasn‚Äôt just my current predicament either. It wouldn‚Äôt be long until I had to actually go *inside*. I knew Kila, Heshin, and Grace were all waiting for me. They wouldn‚Äôt judge me for my reservations, but being surrounded by so many strangers‚Ä¶

*One‚Ä¶two‚Ä¶three‚Ä¶four‚Ä¶*

I took a deep breath in, held it, and released it just as Dr. Jacobson had taught me. That exercise alone had been a boon in so many stressful situations. It could carry me through one more.

*I just wish Indali would arrive. Loitering outside is just making my nerves compound.*

Despite my desire to just start out ‚Äògirl‚Äôs paw out‚Äô as soon as possible, I wanted to make sure Indali knew where to go. She wouldn‚Äôt recognize the others, and I was likely to get lost in the crowd since I was a little smaller than average for my species.

*I really could stand to eat better. It‚Äôs just easy to forget while I‚Äôm at my flytser. When Bonti was staying with me, he always made sure I ate‚Ä¶*

A flash of blue feathers halted my thoughts. Indali separated herself from the others meandering about, making her way over to me.

‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late!‚Äù she squawked. ‚ÄúI got a little preoccupied with band stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúO-oh,‚Äù My ears perked up at the mention of our group. ‚ÄúIs it important?‚Äù

Indali‚Äôs wings drooped, seemingly disheartened.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not great news, but let‚Äôs not worry about that right now. This is supposed to be fun, right? Admittedly, I haven‚Äôt really made many friends outside of the band‚Ä¶or any for that matter. I‚Äôm excited to meet yours!‚Äù

‚ÄúR-right,‚Äù I turned to lead us inside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be p-pleased to meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you alright? You seem pretty nervous?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be f-fine. Just‚Ä¶people‚Ä¶a lot‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶right. It‚Äôs fine. We‚Äôll just blend right into the flock!‚Äù

She was right, of course. I was being paranoid. All these people were just here to have some fun after a paw of classes. They wouldn‚Äôt pay me any mind, especially once I was with the others.

I led us through tables, spotting my trio of friends‚Ä¶and another with dark, lengthy wool. Did I recognize her?

‚ÄúLanyd!‚Äù Kila waved an arm to flag us down, her voice cutting through the conversations scattered around us. ‚ÄúAnd you must be Indali?‚Äù her ears swiveled to my bandmate as we got closer.

‚ÄúY-yes,‚Äù Indali‚Äôs outgoing personality suddenly dried right up. ‚ÄúTh-that‚Äôs me.‚Äù

After a moment of being surprised at her shift in demeanor, I realized where her attention was focused. Grace‚Äôs reflective mask was pointed directly at her. In retrospect, I should have mentioned to Indali that Grace would be joining us. With how she got along with Wes, I‚Äôd all but forgotten the risk of bringing their species together, even after the mess of a tour we had before.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, love,‚Äù Grace‚Äôs voice was slightly muffled by the mask. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt bite. You‚Äôre part of Lanyd‚Äôs band, yeah? Any friend of hers can‚Äôt be all that bad!‚Äù

‚ÄúTh-thanks,‚Äù Indali hopped up into one of the empty seats. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been refreshing, having Wes not expect the worst from me like some other Humans do. I‚Äôm relieved that you‚Äôre the same kind of person, Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGrace,‚Äù she extended a hand, one that Indali took in her talons. ‚ÄúGrace Patel.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm Kila,‚Äù the tan-coated Venlil chimed in. ‚ÄúThese two are Heshin and Suldet!‚Äù

I knew Heshin, of course, being our resident kinpol player for the concert last term. Suldet, however, was a new, very shaggy face. Moreover, she was outfitted with some of the artificial pelts Humans wore, covering most of her body. Despite my unfamiliarity, Indali‚Äôs face lit up with recognition.

‚ÄúSuldet? Wait, are you the head of the textile club?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would be me!‚Äù the wooly Venlil chimed. ‚ÄúHave we met before?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, not quite, but I believe Linev went to you about our band shirts.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh! You‚Äôre The Flaming Paws! How does the shirt fit? I‚Äôd never tried to make something for a Krakotl before. I honestly had no idea if I was doing it right. All my other stuff is modeled after Human clothes, but Humans don't have wings.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt actually fits very well!‚Äù Indali replied. ‚ÄúIt does make it difficult to use my wings for lift, but it's not like I can achieve full flight on Venlil Prime anyway. I just use them sometimes to take a big step.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was a little worried about that,‚Äù Suldet scanned over Indalia's form. ‚ÄúI might be able to remedy that in the future. Sleeveless might be the way to go. Linev said the name was probably temporary, so you'll need a new shirt soon anyway, right?‚Äù

I thought I saw Indali freeze up for a moment, but she quickly reset to her previous state.

‚ÄúYeah, I'm sure ‚ÄòThe Flaming Paws‚Äô won't stick. Wes doesn't even *have* paws.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must admit, the name is a little bland,‚Äù Grace giggled. ‚ÄúSounds like a name a teenage garage band would put together.‚Äù

*I actually kind of liked it‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre all here, so how about some drinks?‚Äù Kila stood up from her seat. ‚ÄúFirst round is on me, courtesy of the university scholarship I seemed to have stumbled into. Grace, I imagine you‚Äôll want something watered down?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say ‚Äòwatered down‚Äô like you lot aren‚Äôt guzzling liquid death!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre on our planet now, so it‚Äôs watered down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take something middle of the road myself,‚Äù Indali interjected. ‚ÄúVenlil liquor is a lot even for me. Whatever Grace takes, double it for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever *you* take,‚Äù Grace pointed a finger at Kila, ‚Äúmake it a quarter for me.‚Äù

Kila snickered to herself.

‚ÄúAlright, putting the pressure of selection on me, eh? What about everyone else?‚Äù

‚ÄúMight as well make it easy for you and say to get the same for me,‚Äù Suldet answered.

‚ÄúSame here,‚Äù Heshin agreed.

‚ÄúLanyd?‚Äù Kila‚Äôs ears swiveled to me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm f-fine with what you‚Äôre having. Anything will do.‚Äù

Frankly, I was just eager to have something to do with myself. Even with familiar people, the bustle of the establishment was starting to become overwhelming. I kneaded my paws together, much preferring the idea of having a drink to sip on.

‚ÄúAlright, I guess I‚Äôll just get my usual then,‚Äù Kila beeped and turned to the bar. ‚ÄúBe right back!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but you two were in the concert last term, right?‚Äù Indali pointed a talon each at Heshin and Grace. ‚ÄúI was trying to remember where I‚Äôd seen you. Hearing your names jogged my memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Heshin flicked her ears affirmative. ‚ÄúKila helped set up as well, but she was sort of tucked away with Cora in the control booth.‚Äù

‚ÄúCora?‚Äù

‚ÄúM-my exchange partner,‚Äù I clarified. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sh-shame she couldn‚Äôt be here. It would be nice to see her in person again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get a chance at some point, love,‚Äù Grace assured me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd love to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware you had an exchange partner,‚Äù Indali tilted her head to the side. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall you mentioning her before.‚Äù

‚ÄúI r-really need to speak with her more,‚Äù I scratched at the wool on my arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been d-difficult to find the time with band practice, tours, classes, and shows.‚Äù

‚ÄúCertainly sounds like you‚Äôve got a lot on your plate,‚Äù Suldet observed. ‚ÄúThen again, it feels like everyone is busy lately.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me about it,‚Äù Grace sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been giving lessons like crazy, but I‚Äôm still not as bogged down as Haeli. I wanted her to tag along tonight, but she‚Äôs got lots of course prep to do. She‚Äôs been working with Blyne to reevaluate White Hill‚Äôs musical curriculum, broadening the scope a little bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù Heshin swayed her tail. ‚ÄúPlaying Human music definitely opened my eyes to what was possible. That, and other things now that there‚Äôs so many ‚Äòpredators‚Äô wandering around. A cycle ago, there‚Äôs no way I would have believed that I‚Äôd be sharing a drink with you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seems my evaluation of this venue was correct,‚Äù Indali looked around. ‚ÄúI figured it would be more Human-friendly than other locations.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I was surprised to be honest,‚Äù Grace nodded. ‚ÄúKila called up here ahead of time to see if they‚Äôd even serve me. Turns out they actually quite like Human patrons. They don‚Äôt have to spend as much on liquor for us!‚Äù

That garnered a collective giggle from the table just in time for Kila to return with the aforementioned drinks. A couple of the glasses had colored bands around them, presumably marking the ‚Äòwatered down‚Äô drinks for Indali and Grace. Kila looked somewhat nervously between them before handing one to the lone Human.


‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶I sorta already forgot which was which. You have a nose. See if that smells reasonable.‚Äù

Grace opened the mouth hatch on her mask to let more air in, then took a whiff. She immediately recoiled, sliding the container across the table to Indali.

‚ÄúI certainly hope that one‚Äôs not for me, love,‚Äù she coughed. ‚ÄúBloody hell!‚Äù

‚ÄúHere, try this one,‚Äù Kila passed her the other glass with a band.

Grace sniffed at the receptacle again, this time adopting a more relaxed posture.

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs more reasonable.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet!‚Äù Kila started handing the rest of us our glasses. ‚ÄúNow the rest of us non-lightweights can have our *real* drinks! I grabbed us a gleamfruit and duskberry cocktail. It starts out tangy, but gets sweeter as you go!‚Äù

I took the drink in my paws. The fluid was mostly a very light pink, though it had a slight gradient of blue as it ran deeper. It certainly looked appealing. I was never much for alcohol, but I could appreciate a good cocktail. During the concert afterparty, the drinks helped me shake some of my nerves. While I was still wary of making a habit out of it, I hoped that I could loosen up the same way here.

‚ÄúAlright girls!‚Äù Kila raised her own glass just a bit. ‚ÄúI know there‚Äôs been a lot of chaos lately, and a lot of it has been fucking awful. We‚Äôre living through absolute insanity, but hey, we‚Äôre still here! Even with all the Federation tampering and conspiring, even with them trying to put us down, we still get to meet up for drinks as friends. I‚Äôve been told Humans do this thing called a toast. Grace, I‚Äôm sure you're familiar?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Grace raised her own glass. ‚ÄúBy all means, lead us.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúA toast then! To us still being here despite everything!‚Äù

Grace and Kila clinked their glasses together, and the rest of us followed suit. There was something satisfying about the gesture, creating a sense of comradery between us. Some of my nerves melted away before I even took a sip. The air was filled with the buzz of pure optimism.

Soon enough, I was sure the buzz would be *inside* too‚Ä¶

*[Fast-forward transcription: 26 minutes]*

‚ÄúDon't get me started on material acquisition,‚Äù Suldet groaned in response to Kila's own complaint. ‚ÄúI'm pretty sure I learned things I wasn't supposed to while trying to get clothing materials.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù Heshin giggled. ‚ÄúFor artificial pelts?‚Äù

Suldet picked up her glass and swirled the last remnants of her drink around the bottom. We were all on our second round, though I was still closer to the top of my glass. I took a sip to put another dent in the beverage, this time with more sour flavors rolling over my tongue.

‚ÄúSo Humans make clothes out of all kinds of things,‚Äù Suldet explained. ‚ÄúCotton is a plant fiber, polyester is all synthetic, and so on. Then, while I was doing research, the topic of *wool* suddenly jumped out at me!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù Grace covered her already-covered face with her hands.

‚ÄúWool? As in, like‚Ä¶*wool* wool?‚Äù Kila leaned forward.

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Suldet confirmed.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶Humans don't have-‚Äù

‚ÄúYep!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo where do they get it?‚Äù Heshin had one ear swiveled towards Suldet, and her other towards Grace.

‚ÄúWhere else? Animals!‚Äù

Kila and Heshin both gasped. Indali's feathers ruffled.

‚ÄúGrace!‚Äù Kila's voice was filled with disbelief. ‚ÄúDo Humans hunt for *clothes?*‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, we don't kill sheep for wool, love!‚Äù Grace quickly replied. ‚ÄúWe just sheer it off their bodies.‚Äù

‚ÄúWool thief!‚Äù Heshin covered her scruff with her paws defensively.

‚ÄúLook, if we didn't sheer it, it would become overgrown! It's healthy for them!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do they survive without Humans then?‚Äù Indali queried. ‚ÄúWouldn't they just be overgrown all the time?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶‚Äù Grace sagged in her seat. ‚ÄúWe sort of selectively bred them that way‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù Kila sounded as interested as she was put off. ‚ÄúYou literally *made* them reliant on you?!‚Äù

‚ÄúShhh! Not so loud,‚Äù Grace nervously looked around. ‚ÄúOkay, first of all, *I* didn't do anything! No one said the Human race was perfect. Second, is it really so bad? We feed them, protect them, and care for them. Certainly that's better than living in the wild.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose that's true,‚Äù Heshin admitted. ‚ÄúStill unsettling to think about.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is why we don't bring it up,‚Äù Grace sighed. ‚ÄúHonestly, Suldet, why did you feel the need to mention that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶I actually got pretty curious about it, and I really wanted to use the material‚Ä¶‚Äù Suldet wiggled in her seat. ‚ÄúBut it was *impossible* to get real wool to Venlil Prime due to restrictions, so‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶I had to make due‚Ä¶‚Äù

Everyone took on looks of confusion, but my own eyes went wide in realization.

‚ÄúYou didn't‚Ä¶‚Äù the words tumbled out of my mouth.

‚ÄúI did,‚Äù Suldet's ears flicked in confirmation as she shrunk into her seat. ‚ÄúLet's just say that you really don't want to see what I look like under these clothes.‚Äù

I was fairly certain the entire bar heard Heshin and Kila scream.

*[Fast-forward transcription: 38 minutes]*

‚ÄúOh! Oh!‚Äù Kila was practically bouncing in her seat. ‚ÄúHow about that one guy‚Ä¶what‚Äôs his name? He does the that anti-predator show that‚Äôs been blowing up lately. Blows a lot of hot air.‚Äù

‚ÄúRux!‚Äù Heshin pointed at Kila, nearly knocking over her fourth glass in the process. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! That‚Äôs the one! Can you do his voice?‚Äù

Indali resituated herself, seemingly having to take on a completely different posture to get the desired effect.

‚ÄúThese ‚Äògentle predators‚Äô are spreading their taint into our society! Remember, people, predators are tricksters! Don‚Äôt be deceived!‚Äù

I‚Äôd never seen this ‚ÄòRux‚Äô person‚Äôs show before, but judging by the way the others fell over themselves laughing, I assumed Indali was spot on.

‚ÄúGod, I don‚Äôt know who this windbag is, but he sounds like he deserves to be on the receiving end of some taint,‚Äù Grace chuckled. ‚ÄúSounds like another talking head spouting an agenda for his own benefit.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, totally,‚Äù Heshin agreed. ‚ÄúAnyone that actually gets to know a Human knows he‚Äôs full of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf not for Humans, for the exchange project last term, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúDr. Jacobson and Cora helped me so much. It‚Äôs awful knowing that there‚Äôs such hostility directed at them.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople just don‚Äôt want to admit they were wrong about Humans,‚Äù Kila huffed. ‚ÄúUgh, even thinking about it makes me want another drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed!‚Äù Suldet chimed.

*[Fast-forward transcription: 17 minutes]*

‚Äú*God* this might be my new favorite‚Ä¶or maybe it‚Äôs just the way it mixes with the drink‚Ä¶‚Äù

Grace turned the piece of candy over in her mouth, analyzing its flavor.

‚ÄúOh, I promise it‚Äôs great regardless,‚Äù Heshin assured her. ‚ÄúMy brother makes only the best stuff. I meant to bring a whole bag of candy to the concert last term, but I was so nervous that I completely forgot!‚Äù

‚ÄúTell your brother he has the Human market cornered if this is what he‚Äôs putting out. Holy hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how he‚Äôd feel about that, but I‚Äôll keep it in mind!‚Äù

Should I stick with the 6x9 or will the 6.5 inch play better with the sub??

I am looking for good sound quality, clarity‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm interested in having nice midrange, but don‚Äôt want things to feel muddy. I also don‚Äôt listen to bass heavy music (indie rock, rock)"
