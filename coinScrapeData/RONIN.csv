With And Without Mercy : Comparing Mizu to Sanjuro,BlueEyeSamurai,1i9u50c,2025-01-25 13:58:57,6,0.88,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueEyeSamurai/comments/1i9u50c/with_and_without_mercy_comparing_mizu_to_sanjuro/,KidChanbara,,"\[WARNING - Season 1 Episode 5 Spoilers\]

In the early 1960s two classic samurai movies were directed by Akira Kurosawa - ""Yojimbo"" and ""Sanjuro"". The main character in both was a wandering ronin named Sanjuro - my impression of his back story is that he's a master swordsman who always picked the wrong (losing) side. He's given up on finding a clan to join, and just drifts. He's very gruff, and the violent solution to a problem seems to be the first that comes to his mind, but underneath there's a heart of gold that - against his better judgement - makes him support the weak and the just against the criminals and corrupt.

He has been in the wars, and uses strategy. But often war strategy requires mercilessness. 

In the opening scene of ""Yojimbo"", he sees a young man leave his parents' boring farm for a short, exciting life - he later joins a gang that is terrorizing a village. The same young man makes an appearance at the end of the movie, just after Sanjuro has cut down the last group that same gang. The young man is frozen with fear and is no danger to Sanjuro, who comes at him like a murderous storm. But Sanjuro recognizes the young man, halts his attack, and essentially says ""shoo!""; the audience is left to assume the guy goes back to his parents to spend many long boring years, alive.

But in ""Sanjuro"" - the ronin must rescue a group of earnest young samurai from their own clan that has been taken over by a corrupt leader. Sanjuro is acting as a double agent, so no one must know that he's the one who rescued the samurai, who are being held in the middle of a courtyard surrounded by clan warriors. So Sanjuro chooses the violent solution - he attacks, and kills every clan warrior, so no one is left alive to tell the truth. The scene starts as one brave man taking on a large group, but devolves into a slaughter as he kills men who are crying out in fear or trying to run away. Merciless war strategy.

I think Mizu has two modes of fighting.  She's in ""human mode"" when she's up against mediocre opponents. In this mode she's more likely to be trash talking. The ""onry≈ç mode"" she uses in dire need, like when she needs to fight despite being wounded, or she's up against many simultaneous enemies. It blossomed at the horse farm when she used it against the warriors who had come to capture or kill the half-breed. Mizu probably used it repeatedly during the search and killing of the white man Violet.

Inside the brothel, Mizu comes across one of the 1000 Claws warriors, a young man cowering out of sight, too afraid to attack Mizu went she finds him. She pauses, then spares his life. The coward Claw has a distinctive long hairstyle, contrasting to most of the other Claws. This makes it easier for the audience to tell him from the other Claws.

Later in the big outdoor battle Mizu has just saved herself and everyone else in Madame Kaji's brothel by going into onry≈ç mode, and the last two remaining Claws who have been standing a distance away turn tail and run - Mizu just watches them go. As she starts walking to the Claws' headquarters, out of the corner of her eye Mizu sees the same young coward. He's gotten out of the brothel, but couldn't find the courage to attack Mizu in the final fight. Once again, he's cowering, totally not a danger to Mizu. She offhandedly disposes of him with a stab of her sword/naginata. He's wearing the colors of the enemy, is in close proximity, and is therefore a legitimate target for death. Maybe there was a little strategy involved in making sure he wasn't a danger behind her back, but that's pretty weak.

Onry≈ç mode is good for battle survival, but it turns off a lot of Mizu's positive qualities like empathy and mercy. It also uses up a lot of Mizu's endurance - she's always really weak after the adrenaline wears off.

I got a thing or two to say about Mizu's ""betrayal"" of Akemi, but this post is long enough already!"

I am moving away from single issue comic books but have also been loving Feral and Hyde Street so any recommendations similar to these in terms of story or artwork would be great!

I am already getting Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees and Volume 1 of Something is Killing the Children for my birthday next week based on recommendations from here and YouTube so looking forward to starting those

"How to master vanilla Ryoma Sakamoto boss, in-depth guide. No block, no damage, no items, no skills (Martial Arts), Hard mode, Master Rank (Dojo).",riseoftheronin,1i9l1y9,2025-01-25 06:30:30,4,0.84,0,https://youtu.be/aPehofejG2o?si=H9ZHAx-rEZLcFl_r,sunashigure1,Guide,"""Ronin formerly of the Tosa clan. Determined to keep a steady hand on the tiller of Japan as it opens its ports to foreign trade, he tirelessly searches for the right course of action. An endearingly earnest soul, he is quick to gain the affections of others. Not only is he a master of the Hokushin-Itto-ryu school of swordsplay, but he is also a sharp shot with a pistol that was given to him by his dear friend Shinsaku Takasugi"". 

Ryoma Sakamoto, the ""vanilla"" Dojo version. Much easier than his ""fierce"" counterpart, so I decided to make things more fun and perfect this fight with no block (and other restrictions). For more advanced players this encounter is one of the easiest and may seem irrelevant, but since we cover every single Dojo fight, it just needs to be done. Plus it could help the new Rise of the Ronin players. 

As for Ryoma's moves, 2 regular combos to be aware of. 3-hit (3 stabs) & 4-hit (swing, stab, swing, swing) ones. The former needs to be deflected rather rapidly, the latter has a delayed ender. Boss has also 1 Martial Art, but it's rather easy to deflect, we just need to react fast. 2 Critical Hits should be enough to take him down ‚Äì successful Countersparks will make that process much smoother. 

On a side note, we'll analyze & perfect his big story (bond) fight too, in the nearest future.

More tips:

-Ryoma Sakamoto wields the wooden Katana, so it's best to choose the Ten style (better Ki management),

-to get the Master Rank in Dojo, we have to beat our enemy as fast as possible, preferably on Hard, with no damage taken and with a lot of Countersparks,

-just one Martial Art - Overhead Slash. We remember this fast (0,09 secs), special move; deflect the moment he ""kneels"" (blink),

-even though it's Ryoma's ""vanilla"" Dojo version, he does recover fast. Best to punish with 3 regular hits (third one will be blocked but deal good Ki damage), when we parry the aforementioned Overhead Slash Martial Art,

-boss can perform fast dodges & counters, so don't overdo your attacks,

-Blade Flash to regain more Ki. Super useful technique in Dojo.

Good luck!"

Now with a new Ninja gaiden that was just announced. It was also announced that it was developed by Platinum game so we know team Ninja outside of maybe a couple of nuance things didn't have deep pockets in that.

 So that means the team Ninja has been working on a project. As much as I would love for it to be Nioh 3 but I don't think it will be, but if it is that would be great. 

I wonder if they're going to do something new or do a rise of the Ronin DLC, but seeing how this is the neo community if they were to announce Nioh 3, what aspects would y'all like them to add to the game? Because it would obviously have to be a new original story based off of how the second one ended. "
Theory I have on Vaal and the child gakki. Spoilers for season 2 and 3.,Ordeal_Webtoon,1i9j32s,2025-01-25 04:04:37,10,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ordeal_Webtoon/comments/1i9j32s/theory_i_have_on_vaal_and_the_child_gakki/,Cole2197,Theory,"I know there has been the theory that the child gakki is the third child of may and sabito that Vaal somehow helped survive, my thought on that is that the ice slowed May's vitals and kept her body in good enough condition the fetus hadn't fully died yet or at least could be saved then Vaal took the fetus and helped it survive through a mix of his blood talent and early titan tech. And given what has been said in season 3 recently it seems the theory on the child gakki might be true but I have a theory on what Vaal might do with the child gakki later because of this. So my theory is that later in this war when Vaal is dying, if he dies, then the child gakki will show up to him to try and help him and in a moment of desperation either transfers dothaneel to the gakki so his talent will live on to help Thanatos or the more likely thing and the more interesting one Vaal discovers a new way for him to cheat death and full on transfers his talent and his soul into the gakki basically doing a body swap. And as to why Vaal hasn't done something like this in the past the reason could be that he never needed to and the circumstances for him to be able to do it had never happened and maybe because of complicated it is, it could be a one time use thing. Che's brother said his body would be just a shell, most likely when he was in May's womb the fetus did die and his soul passed on but Vaal brought the body back making it a kimyo with no real soul just a talent living in it, so since the body is a shell Vaal could take over and fill the vessel. This new body would give him the strength of a gakki, that has most likely had more of his blood in his body then anyone else in the Thanatos army, and all his centuries of experience along with a younger body that is from the heart clan that has been said to have powerful kimyo's born in it and would have both Dothaneel and the gakki's talent giving him even more power then before. And maybe in this same moment Che sees what Vaal has done to his brothers body and loses his composure and in a moment of rage attacks Vaal now in the gakki's body but Vaal dodges the attack and in that moment cuts Che's arm off. This feels like a solid last push to Che becoming ronin and a good way for him to lose his arm since Vaal's blood negates ilos regeneration. I also think in either path in the future we see yukiko fight the gakki/Vaal and as they face each other we see the heart clan and hisame behind her showing the legacy she carries for the heart clan but behind Vaal we just see his original body and a large blood monster showing how he has given up on a legacy and focused on achieving his goal and becoming a monster and this fight could basically be Vaal vs Sabito next generation.

So what do you all think of this theory for how things could play out? I have said this theory in a couple places but wanted to make a full on post about it to share with all of you. And I think this is a solid theory for something crazy to happen near the end of the season and leading to Che becoming Ronin. Also I know the whole villain swapping body thing is done in a couple series but I think it would be perfect for Vaal and would work for the story as a way to be a final push to Che. Tell me what you all think of this theory please."

decision to act like a collective of equality and not the fronters with an entourage,plural,1i967yf,2025-01-24 16:15:38,23,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/comments/1i967yf/decision_to_act_like_a_collective_of_equality_and/,arthorpendragon,,"so we have been acting like the fronting sub-system thor/micheala are like the leaders and the rest of the sub-systems are like an entourage of people following behind giving us advice. we realise now, that that is not a collective of equal value and equal opportunity, and that others have fronted and been great at that. so we decided we will try something new and try to feel as if all members have equal opportunity to front and to lead. thor and micheala may not be the best leaders. in the avengers thor (creator of the avengers) was one of the strongest avengers but it was actually captain america who lead the team in missions.

previously we had scheduled time for activities and projects but now we will give opportunity for members to do their thing if they need to. to front or talk or do as and when needed, we are trying to be more spontaneous and give the front up for whoever feels strongly to do so at the time. we have a lot of different projects we would like to do but seem paralysed in deciding what should be worked on at the moment. its like a question of energy, and we need the right member with the right energy at the right time in order to start and finish anything. scheduling something doesnt mean you will have energy and motivation to do it.

has anybody have any ideas on this and their experiences on moving from a fronter managed hierarchical system to a flat spontaneous system? any advice and stories?

oh and we wont being signing out micheala anymore. if we know who made a post or reply we will sign their name. also we have just hit 40x members this week with new sub-systems and our first humans in the system.

I lightly modded the game last summer but I've been feeling the need to jack in. I've been following Sinitar's Updated Guide. I'm skipping the new update this week for a good while. My question is; Should I use his recommended Weapon Tweaks and Balance mod or Guns redone v3? I've got some more work to do before I start the run. Has anyone used both? Pros and Cons? Does it really matter that much since both are similar? I generally agree the weapons performance were a little too distant and half the weapons were underpowered by comparison. I wont use hardcore 22, I've mostly buffed V and the enemies. I actually kind of prefer a long time to kill. Here's the mods in question, and my combat mods underneath, followed from sinitars guide. Thanks for your help guys. Im a total min maxer.

Trump‚Äôs Crypto Revolution: Executive Order Sparks Major Policy Shift,WorldMagzineMedia,1i929pv,2025-01-24 13:27:23,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldMagzineMedia/comments/1i929pv/trumps_crypto_revolution_executive_order_sparks/,Jhonjournalist,,"https://preview.redd.it/jbeyldztizee1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f4c5e94f686a4566b9d254166d09291d1db9f77

* Trump signs an executive order creating a pro-crypto regulatory framework.
* A taskforce will oversee Bitcoin reserves and[¬†blockchain](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/ronin-and-transak-unite-revolutionizing-nft-payments-and-blockchain-gaming/)¬†development.
* Protections for blockchain developers and firms are introduced to drive innovation.

Donald Trump has signed a historic executive order to advance the U.S.¬†[cryptocurrency](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/singapore-leads-asia-as-a-cryptocurrency-powerhouse/)¬†industry, fulfilling his campaign promise to champion digital assets.

This executive order also¬†[provides legal protections](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/u-k-treasury-declares-crypto-staking-outside-collective-investment-rules/)¬†for developers, miners, and private companies operating blockchain networks, shielding them from legal and regulatory uncertainty.

# Trump‚Äôs Bold Crypto Move: Bitcoin Reserve and Innovation Support

The executive order lays the foundation for a groundbreaking national[¬†Bitcoin reserve](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/bitcoin-soars-past-109000-amid-speculation-over-trump-driven-crypto-momentum/#google_vignette). By utilizing cryptocurrencies seized by federal authorities, the U.S. aims to create a strategic digital asset stockpile. This initiative could not only stabilize crypto markets but also position the U.S. as a dominant force in the global digital economy.

David Sacks, appointed as the administration‚Äôs crypto and AI czar, will lead the new taskforce. The group comprises key agency leaders, including the Treasury Secretary and heads of the SEC and CFTC, ensuring a comprehensive approach to policymaking. Their focus will be on balancing innovation with necessary regulatory oversight.

Additionally, the executive order introduces protections for blockchain network users, emphasizing the administration‚Äôs commitment to fostering innovation. This move is expected to draw more developers and¬†[crypto companies](https://worldmagzine.com/trending/this-year-crypto-companies-ads-in-super-bowl-were-banned/)¬†to the U.S., reversing the industry‚Äôs recent migration to friendlier jurisdictions.

Trump‚Äôs personal association with a meme coin, however, has sparked some criticism. While it underscores his commitment to crypto, detractors worry it could trivialize the broader industry‚Äôs credibility. Despite this, market reactions have been optimistic, with Bitcoin and other major tokens rallying after the announcement.

Trump‚Äôs executive order could be a turning point for the cryptocurrency landscape, setting the stage for innovation,¬†[economic growth](https://worldmagzine.com/economy/morocco-and-el-salvador-forge-stronger-ties-for-economic-growth/), and U.S. leadership in digital assets."

The Sunzi Guide to Omnidimensional Hyperchess,LancerRPG,1i8r8zp,2025-01-24 03:57:25,91,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LancerRPG/comments/1i8r8zp/the_sunzi_guide_to_omnidimensional_hyperchess/,eCyanic,,"After Lich, here we come upon another mech known to be complicated, and a guide that will hopefully help you when piloting this thing

As always, I'll mostly be summarizing the Sunzi and its traits, you'll have to look at the mech's statblock itself to get specifics. Starting with the basics, up to the true omnibrain tactical chess as we'll find out later.

# Basics

The Sunzi has pretty balanced stats, but less durable since it has 7 base hp, 7 evade, and 3 repcap. It is still an HA mech though, so it does have an above average 7 heat, though I believe this might be the lowest of the HA mechs, just tying with the Gilgamesh. It has the specialist special of having a single mount, because everything it does, it doesn't really need big weapons.

Its ability to Support, comes from its good-end sensors and SP, and *especially* its traits. Sunzi is the mech to bring if you want to do some movement and positioning support.

**Safe Harbor** \- If an ally teleports, they can always teleport adjacent to you, instead of literally anywhere else. Adjacent to you is always valid (unless it's obstructed or something), as long as it's a teleport. This does include non-voluntary teleports, but we'll talk about that later. (the 50 space clause is practically absent because the biggest most maps go is 40, maybe 45)

**Anchor** \- Simple! Never move unless you want to (and even sometimes even if you do want to). Gravity still works though, this is not a nerf, this is so you don't just jump and get stuck in the air with no way to move forever.

**Slip** \- a short-ranged teleport that gives Sunzi some very good mileage with its average 4 speed. This will combo with... a *lot* later, but for now, it's as straightforward of a teleport as you can get.

**‚Äî**

**Reality Carver** \- the Core, both active and passive, let's start with

**Blink Anchor** \- the core passive, which I think is slightly more complicated than the core active. Basically a small thing you can put down (with a Quick Action), and which functions like another tiny sunzi Safe Harbor, so your friends can teleport themselves to it. If you have LoS to them.

You can *also* teleport hostiles to it, all it needs is a Limited charge and LoS. This Core passive is gonna be our basis for some *gambits*. Some absolutely lmaos. We will explain this later.

The Blink Anchor is not active unless it's deployed though, so a friend carrying it can't just become an improvised Sunzi.

**Art of War** \- the core active. Teleport people as a reaction! with charges. This is actually pretty fully unbound from the Blink Anchors, like you don't need to have them interact at all if you don't want them to. The charges here are separate from the Blink Anchor's, and also are not 'Limited' so don't actually increase, you only ever always get 6 charges. Which is actually enough for most cases.

‚Äî

# Starter Gambits

to start with, let's look at some of the cool things we can do with our own traits.

**Safe Harbor**

Can't really improve this more, this is purely a support tool, it'll be explored later how we can actually use it actively instead of reactively, but for in-mech stuff, one of the only things you can really do is take House Guard 1, and even in that case, you do have to ask your GM if this would work. Many people (at least on pilotnet) would say it doesn't work because of both Harbor's and House Guard 1's wording.

I'd allow it because it's fun as shit, but your GM may be of a different opinion, so ask your GM first before going for it.

If it does work, your safe harbor has suddenly expanded in area, more so if you took Fomorian and got size 2. That's a bunch of spaces that your allies can now teleport to, like an aura of really really good positioning.

**Anchor**

another passive, but a very... aggressive passive. You can't improve it, but you can play off it. You can actually build yourself as a grappler if you wanted and it's very hard to get rid of you, because usually an enemy prefers to do a Ram instead of using the contested free yourself check because a Ram is usually easier. With Sunzi the Ram never works because you can never be moved unless you move.

**Slip**

Getting more tactical. Your only active trait, and you can do some good shit with it:

\*Infiltrate

>Because Slip is 2 spaces, and because teleport doesn't need Line of Sight unless specified, you could literally slip through a 1 space wall. Use this to break LoS, or to get into a space that's hard to get into, or has well guarded entrances.

\*Slip + Blink Anchor/ Cross-map delivery

>Remember how I said Blink Anchors are like smaller sunzis? This is how. You can leave an anchor near your deployment zone (or really anywhere), and go off around the map, do some objectives, do some support. When you need to, you can immediately use Slip, and instead of going 2 spaces, you instead force yourself to teleport adjacent to your Blink Anchor no matter how far away it was. You always have LoS to yourself, and I believe this is exempt from ""can't target yourself"" rules, because this doesn't really target.

>Point is, it was intended to work, (though perhaps it should've just said 'you or any character' so it's extra clear)

>You can't do this to escort/extraction objectives because those are usually just immune to all movement except their standard movement, but a chill enough GM or a different enough sitrep could allow a Sunzi to just win in one or two rounds.

>Besides this though, this also works with grapples! Those only break on involuntary movement, this is very likely *not* involuntary, both the Slip, and the tp destination redirection. Use this to mechnap enemies, or bring allies to safer places.

\*Slow and Immobilize, our nemeses are back.

>Like Soul Vessel, we really don't like being Immobilized, and unlike Soul Vessel, this is more clear cut in that we really don't wanna be Slowed too. Voluntary Teleports in Lancer are still stopped by Immobilize, and if it's not Standard Move, it'll be stopped by Slowed.

>It's not as bad here, there are still a lot of other tools in our arsenal to facilitate teleports, and we at least have none-ass base hp. We like teleporting friends anyway, less ourselves, but either condition will stop Slip.

**Blink Anchors**

\*Tiny Sunzis

>Like I've said, these can basically function like Safe Harbor points, but immobile. What I haven't mentioned yet though, is that it can be picked back up by you, *or by an ally*. Now, it's not really *active* when it's picked up, the ally needs to redeploy it back down to use it again.

>But what this means is a really fast or mobile ally like a Jager Kunst Dusk Wing, super fast Nelson, Core Power Everest, or Jager Kunst Atlas can pick this thing up, do their mobility shenanigans to cross the map, and then you can teleport the rest of your whole team where the mobile buddy left the anchor at.

>This makes half of Gauntlet sitreps much more a breeze, and allows any other sitrep with positioning to be easier.

>This is best achieved with warp grenades, but that will be discussed later.

\*Unsafe Harbor

>You can force enemies to teleport adjacent to your tiny sunzis, but this doesn't even have to be a forced teleport, even if they teleport of their own accord, you could just spend a charge and have LoS to them, and they teleport adjacent to your blink anchor instead. No save, no attack, not even a reaction.

>Absolutely screw over Mirages, and other NPCs that have ""when you move you teleport"" because those are not optional, they will always teleport when they standard move, which means they will always get mechnapped if the Sunzi can see them and has a charge.

>though USE CAUTION WHEN TPING OPERATIVES\*.\* They explode when destroyed, you don't want that near you. (though the blink anchors are none targetable and invulnerable)

\*Safest Harbor

>to expand on the above, if there are Mirages on the enemy team, get ready to have some fun back and forth better-than-counterspell-wars vibes with the Mirages. They have an ability that teleports their allies, but you can make their allies teleport to your blink anchor. You can do this offensively like the above, or defensively, by teleporting the Demolisher or Berserker to your blink anchor instead when the Mirage tries to teleport them into an advance position.

**Art of War**

Potentially one of the best repositioning tools in the game. Teleport any character as a *reaction*, (start or end of turn), no save. The only restriction is if they can stand on the space they go to. And this does have charges which aren't Limited, so you can only ever Art of War 6 times in one mission (unless you have a core battery or simialr reserve)

\*Ally dodges

>If your ally is in a sticky situation, you can Art of War them at the start of their turn to allow them to still move without being scared of an Overwatch. Or since Art of War is definitley involuntary, you can straight up just teleport an ally out of a grapple (or more funnily, teleport the grappler away from the ally)

\*Incredibly fast mechnapping

>In combination with your blink anchors, you can fully out-position an enemy 15 spaces away, again, as a reaction. As an added plus, you don't need to be in-sensors of your blink anchor, just the character, and you can send em even 30 spaces away to your anchor as long as you have sight to it.

>You're also teleporting people, so things with Heavy Frame shouldn't be immune to you since they are only stopped from being pushed, pulled, knocked back, and proned (by smaller mechs)

\*Ordnance lmao

>One of the funniest tags an enemy can have on their guns is ordnance because they become real easy to bully. Off the top of my head, that's really just Snipers and Bombards, who usually stay at long range anyway, but if you can get to 15 of them, you can basically shut them off the moment they start their turn. Ordnance does *not* care how you moved, just that you did move on the turn, so being forced to teleport means you now can't fire an ordnance weapon.

>Remember though, this only works if you art of war them using the 'start of turn' reaction, on their turn.

# Timing your Teleports

Now that we have the starters done, we should talk about a relatively important concept here, which I like to call 'timing', it's a shortened term for playing with the turn order. Lancer doesn't have initiative, so there's no 'fastest goes first'. Players always go first at the start of a combat scene (unless special circumstances like some Veteran systems, and some *very strange \[spoiler redacted\] bosses.*)

But after a Player turn, it's always an enemy turn, not an NPC turn, an enemy, NPCs that are allied, act on the Playerside turn. There's a lot of considerations, but generally you wanna be able to act first or even *be* at the optimal position for you to act.

This means, in between two players, if the second player had an amazing plan, but the enemy that acted before them absolutely dumpstered them, they'll immediately need to rethink their plan.

This also also means, there's tactics in timing, and Sunzi needs the option to be able to act on almost every single piece of 'time' that it can to trigger its teleports.

And it can! Even without using Prepares and just using in-license systems, which befits its namesake.

\*It can teleport allies at the start of their turn, or end of their turn

\*it can teleport allies on its own turn

\*it can teleport allies on enemy turns

\*It can teleport enemies at start/end

\*it can teleport enemies on its own turns

\*it can teleport enemies on allied turns

All these are just the timings, but the Sunzi also has different methods for these timings, whether it's using a reaction to accomplish them, or a quick action. It's so full of versatility. So this was an important kinda concept that is useful to establish early so we can reference them later.

# Tactician's Regalia - In License Systems

Sunzi has some incredible systems and weapons, both for itself, and for general usage, even at LL1, you get 2 super solid picks for movement support, and one for very good control.

**Blink Charges**

Amazing systems, that costs 3SP, which is super worth it. The 'nades are great for support, and great for control. Or even both at the same time. It's not been updated yet, but the errata for it makes it just incredible (lancer-faq.netlify.app/#afea43), basically it's not supposed to target just one character, but any amount of characters in the AOE, so you could reposition both your whole team and the whole opfor if you can hit the AOE! That's wild amounts of tactical utility

The Mine version is also very strong, but mostly better for control than ally support since it can Jam the victim.

I mentioned earlier that you could potentially also cross-map your whole team, you do this by combining the grenades with blink anchor. So, after your fast ally delivers the blink anchor where it's needed, you can warp nade yourself and a massive area around you to blink your whole team adjacent to your anchor

*or* you resolve the warp on yourself first, and then you can arrange your team even better since they can be adjacent to your *or* your anchor! Action Resolution rules in Lancer are a Godsend, man

**Accelerate**

you put two spots and whatever you put in one zooms to the other as direct as it can. Simple in concept, but mildly quagmired in the lack of definition. It's still a useful movement support tool, and can even extend your deployable ranges which are kinda funny in-narrative seeing your jericho walls fly past and deploy themselves at the end of this metaphysical treadmill.

To explain, you would notice, out of every single tech action, this one doesn't mention ""sensors"", but it also doesn't tell you up to how far out you can put them. So the logical conclusion, and one that most people would tell you, is that it does adhere to sensors, because the alternative is being able to put them *absolutely anywhere you have LoS on*.

This is also a tech action. Which means pilots, creatures, and other bios are not affected by the digital treadmill.

This is not a teleport, it's a push, so it can't affect Barbarossas and Drakes even if they want it to, unless you're also size 2

Also, this thing just stays on the field until you recast it somewhere else, so an enemy could definitely use this to their advantage if they wanted to zoom.

All this seems like it's bad, it's not, it does its job solid and straightforward, but you gotta know the shortcomings so you don't get blindsided by them.

At LL2, you have two more cool stuff, but they're a bit less intricate than your LL1s. Warp Rifle is a simple ""teleport whatever you hit"" loading weapon, and tunneler is cool, but mostly redundant with your own safe harbor, though it gives you a different timing than Safe Harbor since it allows allies to teleport to you on their turn instead by just moving into it. Still, tunneler is likely more useful on other mechs that are super fast and can handle the heat more than Sunzi.

LL3 is when we get back to giant brain tactics systems

**Realspace Breach**

Put a 'whitehole' in a Sensors, this little Blast 1 area now can't be affected by everything, but also technically doesn't exist on the map anymore, think of it like it stitches the map together. Anything moving into it teleports adjacent to it. *Teleports* adjacent to it. So this procs your Safe Harbor and Blink Anchors

The more interesting part though, is that it can be targeted with a ranged, non-AOE weapon, which lets always shoots back out to 10 spaces. This even works like a range increase if positioned correctly, so a tortuga shotgun with 3 range, now becomes a range 13 bolt. Or make a shot turn at an angle

Absolutely beware though, enemies can use this same effect on you. The sniper will welcome the 90degree turn around cover.

**Final Secret**

Bit more straightforward, put a buff on yourself or an ally, and then you can teleport them 4 as a reaction anytime they take damage. Importantly though, *after* they take damage, so this can't prevent them from taking damage. They already took it.

This *can* however help them evade more damage, especially from Tier 2 and Tier 3 enemies that gain more attacks like Ronin and Operators. They don't have a chance to reposition to chase either, because you can't make a standard move inside a Skirmish or Barrage.

You could also... shoot at them? If you really needed to. Especially if they have enough armor to reduce a shot to 0 (taking 0 damage still counts as taking damage) But like, that's not very action efficient of a teleport.

‚Äî

# Queen to ùõÇ-Y-12

It's time to talk about outside-license systems that sunzi gets weird with. Doesn't cover absolutely everything though, keep discovering cool combos.

**Ophidian Sun Defense - Metafold Carver (Minotaur License 2)**

Gives you another timing to your teleports. You can hit an ally with this to teleport them immediately to you or your blink anchor on your turn. You still roll the 1d6+1, and then can decide if you would rather teleport them 1d6+1 closer to you, adjacent to you immediately (with safe harbor), or toward your blink anchor. Incredibly handy for yanking an ally out of a bad situation, without Limited (blink charges), core active (art of war), or waiting for a correct trigger (like final secret). This costs a quick action, but sometimes that's all it takes to tide the battle in your favor.

Also, remember, this is an Invade, but invades always auto-hit willing allies!

Fold Space can also be very useful to give an ally some breathing room, or hit on an enemy that likes reactions like Sentinels and Archers, but we find that a nice bonus instead of the main thing

**Three Sunzi Monte - H0R\_OS Upgrade III (Goblin License 3)**

Celestial Shackles is the one we like here. Technically the same timing as Ophidian Trek, but has different utilities. This is a buff you can put on an ally in advance pretty much, like Final Secret, you could mark an Ally's location, to be celestial shackled to later. But since you're Sunzi, when you actually trigger your celestial shackle, you can choose if they go back to the marked area, to you, or to your blink anchor.

Best of all, the NPCs (by extension, technically the GM), doesn't know where you're gonna teleport them, so you could have 3 very tactical positions and your shackled ally could show up on any of them. Potentially very fun on Control sitreps where you can place yourself on one point, blink anchor on another, and shackle on a 3rd, and the ally could be teleported to any of the 3.

Opening up some Todo, Boogie-Woogie style bait and switches. Though, as a big warning, the setup for this is hard since blink anchor setup is always gonna be cumbersome if you do it yourself (since you have to deploy it adjacent to you, and as a quick action)

The biggest con with this than Ophidian trek is that this is 3 LLs deep instead of just 2 LLs, but Goblin license itself is a very good license line not just for controllers, but also for supports, just that there's not a lot of teleports besides this one, so you'll have to be ok with your plays being slightly less nebula-brained.

**Janus Gambit - Striker(?) Sunzi**

Going the very opposite direction from all the mindblowing tactical support is a straightforward controller(?)/striker(?). Utilizing other teleport systems like Manticore's Beckoner, and Mourning Cloak's Fold Knives and Singularity Motivator, you can be a very zippy controller. With Beckoner, if you've left your Blink Anchor near your team in advance, you could potentially mechnap one enemy, swapping places with them, then immediately Grapple another enemy and use your Slip to teleport yourself back to your Blink Anchor... *with* your grappled enemy

Best part is this costs no charges from Blink Anchor because it's not an unwilling teleport that you forced to arrive adjacent to the anchor, it's your own teleport that you used, which just so happened to bring the grappled foe with you.

CAVEAT: There's a possibility that grappling through tp into blink anchor is actually not possible, specifically because Blink Anchor says ""you may **force** them to appear"" which could be interpreted as involuntary movement, even if you're doing this to yourself. In that case, the grapple mechnapping doesn't work (you can still Slip with a grappled foe, just not through blink anchor), but everything else still works.

Fold Knives and Singularity Motivator are for fun teleporting around, you can teleport next to your blink anchor too, but most times your anchor's in a farther location than just using it to dodge attacks or reposition in the fray.

# Pre-Match Handshake

The section where we'll talk about the mechs that Sunzi actually really likes to partner or team up with.

**Teleporting Assassin, but,** ***more*** **- Mourning Cloaks.**

Mourning Cloak is all about isolating an enemy and dumping damage dice on them. Mourning Cloak is also secondarily all about teleporting. Most of its systems are teleports, and its Core Active is even *more* teleportation. Which means every movement it can do, it can either teleport forward or back toward the Sunzi or Blink Anchor.

It can also grapple things and then standard move teleport them to the Sunzi, this one is fully allowed since it has different wording to Blink Anchor.

As an added cool thing, that isn't RAW at all, if a Mourning Cloak uses EX Slipstream to teleport 3d6 spaces and rolls 3 same number, instead of disappearing til next Rest, they could instead just reappear adjacent to the Sunzi. Again, completely not RAW, but it's such a big flavor win that most GMs should allow it (and I also wanna implore most GMs reading this to allow it lol)

**Undead Wizard** ***Undead Wizard*** **- Lich**

Yes, the combination of two of the most huge brain mechs in the game. The lich's main thing is Soul Vessel, *which includes a teleport*. So now the Lich can do whatever shenanigans that specific lich was built for, and when it Soul Vessels proactively or for safety, it can arrive at an even *better* location wherever the Sunzi is. Got two snipers about to fire on the Lich? bam, back behind a wall, super safe, or super somewhere else.

**Another Fucking Sunzi**

Allow me to bring forward a though that's probably been in the back of your mind as you were reading this guide.

What's better than teaming up two of the most complex tactical, really fun mechanics mechs in the game? Teaming up with the same mech, twice.

Nothing stops a teammate from picking the same mech as you, except variety, but in this case, the amount of shit you can pull off by two mechs having Slip, two mechs having Safe Harbor, and two active blink anchors. It can get wild wild. Most are teleport shenanigans of course, but the amount of spaces you and your allies could teleport to just doubled. I'll let your imagination and your knowledge after reading the guide run wild.

Also

You could have 4-5 Sunzi's on a team.

(you'll unlikely deal huge damage, but yeah well, just imagine the memetic hazard that is *that*)

# Conclusion

Sunzi is an incredible tactical position and movement support that can make some of the slowest teams blink around in the... blink of an eye. Perfect for battlefield supremacy and objective control.

Harrison Armory would like to thank all our valued partners and friends for attending this demonstration.

Just kidding, it's me again fuckos.

Twenty Horus cells in the nearest 5 systems have been given the designs for your Sunzi.

Also the Voladores know, some of them are pissed, and some of *those* are helping the guys that just got your designs.

get fukt harry

Good luck\~!

Book 2 thoughts and questions,LicaniusTrilogy,1i8qvj2,2025-01-24 03:28:06,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LicaniusTrilogy/comments/1i8qvj2/book_2_thoughts_and_questions/,wildheart_asha,Question,"Just finished book 2 and I'm glad I dove in right after book 1! I feel the pacing was much better in this book and the characters had much more room to breathe as compared to book 1. Loved the Ronin side story and the battle for the title of northwarden. Saw some of the twists and definitely did not see others.  In short, enjoyed myself a lot! Going to dive into 3 asap. I had some theories/questions which I wanted to discuss. 

Absolutely loved the Gassandrid and Tal discussion on what makes a God. With barely and novel time, I'm liking Gass a lot. Ditto Alaris . Unhinged Isilar was also a well done character. The main protagonists somehow seem to fall flat, but the plot more than makes up for it. The reveal about Elocien at the very end was so so dissapinting. It should have been a huge moment ,but so many other things were happening.Why kill off the Duchess Andras ?? 

Breshada twist was incredible! The part where Kara sang the funeral dirge seems tied into the sappy forced romance with Caden in book 1. Have to admire Neth for her persistence. 

My biggest gripe is the magic system . It is not clearly defined what Kan/essence can and can't do and just in case, vessels are always conveniently around to save the day.  Please forgive my spellings üôèüèæ 

1) From the epilogue, head on a pike is Davian. I thought it was going to be Andraiel as he was the first of the Venerate to question El(Shammeloth?) identity. 

2) Scyner is an augur shadow? While  training with Malshash  , Davian is given the cup analogy where Augurs don't touch essence directly, but use Kan to access essence . (holding water in your hands vs a cup) This means that Scyner should still have all his power. 

3) Speaking of Malshash, he mentions he is stuck in Delannis around 70 years before Davian was born. But from memories, he's Caeden /Tal'kamar .Time travel means body in the present is in a coma until you return.   So how is he active in Davian's timeline alongside a version of him stuck in the past ? Does he go after current story. Maybe this will be addressed.  Regarding Davian, what happens when your time travelled self gets killed ? 

4) Orkoth . Please fill out your dating profile. Don't let Neth be the only representation of darkland folk

5) Asar stressing on the importance of memories and lyth getting licanius seemed overhyped in my opinion. I loved the flashback because they made the book better, but Asar could have discussed it as well. Has someone put Caden's memories in chronological order? 

6) Why did the Lyth want licanius ? What can the do with it , if they can't step outside Res Kartha ?  Asar made it seem like a unthinkable future if they get it, but it didn't sound so bad. The lyth as Dracians must have been augurs because their constructions involved both Kan and essence. The chief seemed taken aback at being made into shadows , but my Scyner question applies here as well. 

7) Why does Caeden have to kill all augurs? If he closes the rift, Kan dissapears from the world and Augurs are just normal people. 

8) In the start of the book when Davian and Ishelle are training , we get to know that Hardened Kan can slice through active Kan, but the Kan that was hardened first is always stronger.  Davian could have hardened a Kan blade, kept it for a while and used it to slice through Ishelles disruption shield when she was protecting Ronin. I loved the plot in that story, but ,this felt like a more obvious and easy solution. 

9) Davian ( lie detevtion) , Ishelle ( tracking on contact) , Ronin (Everyone blindly trusting him) seem like passive abilities. They don't seem to need to use Kan or do anything for these things to happen. Ronin mentions that Davian is the only person  with whom he could have a decent conversation. Fessi and Erran need to actively use Kan to do the things they are good at. 

10) Instead of creatures throwing themselves at the boundary, Why can't Gassandrid make a portal ? 

11) If you can use the portal stones to get to the boundary,  Taeris gives his stone to Wirr and tells him the portal will close after he passes through.  Why not  just keep the portal open ? Entire administration could have gone for a quick peek. 

I'm sorry about the length of my post. I got carried away. üòÖ. "

What comics to read?,DCcomics,1i8oz29,2025-01-24 01:09:40,2,0.6,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1i8oz29/what_comics_to_read/,Practical-Fuel-2359,,"Hi everybody! I got into comics last year, and I‚Äôm reading all Superman and Batman. My favorite stories are For All Seasons, All-Star Superman, and The Long Halloween saga. I also really liked Miller work on Batman (until Strikes Again and All-Star B&R) and really disliked his Superman work (as well as Bendis‚Äôs run, that was awful). Really liked also Red Son, Court of Owls, and Moore‚Äôs Supes‚Äô stories.
I got these two characters already covered, and I also read and liked:

- Kingdom Come (Alex Ross is truly a master of his craft)
- Flashpoint (read it years ago)
- Watchmen (didn‚Äôt fall in love tho) 
- Doomsday Clock (liked it as a Supes story)
- Moore‚Äôs Swamp Thing
- Sandman by Neil Gaiman (still reading)
- JLA run by Grant Morrison, and the run by Joe Kelly (but I don‚Äôt really care for big ensembles)
- Green Arrow #549-#552 (liked Moore‚Äôs story, but didn‚Äôt fall in love with the character)
- Superman Metropolis
- Batman Nosferatu
- Wonder Woman the Blue Amazon
- Crisis on Infinite Earths

Non DC stuff I really liked:

- Mark Waid‚Äôs Irredeemable 
- Miller‚Äôs Daredevil run
- Marvel Colors
- Silver Surfer Parabola (mostly for the art)
- Moebius comics
- Invincible
- Berkserk manga (it doesn‚Äôt really fit, but it‚Äôs among my favorite literacy ever)
- Spawn (almost forgot it, I read the first 100 issues a while ago and found the art amazing, the story is just ok)

In my list I‚Äôve got, for now:

- Miller‚Äôs Ronin
- Moore‚Äôs Tom Strong
- Blackest Night 
- Mike Grell‚Äôs The Longbow Hunters

Loeb & Sale are my favorites, I love very work they‚Äôve done. I really like Moore‚Äôs writing, but generally dislike when art gets too political, and I‚Äôm into pre-Crisis comics as well. I also really like the old I‚Äôve already asked on the marvel sub for recommendations, and got other non DC/Marvel/Darkhorse stuff covered. Based on all of that, what DC comics would you recommend me?
Sorry for the long post and bad English"

Hayashi.....All is forgiven.,ninjagaiden,1i8nrkf,2025-01-23 23:55:36,2,0.55,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1i8nrkf/hayashiall_is_forgiven/,Personal-Throat-7897,,"I've been playing team ninja games since the OG NG on Xbox and I am definitely one of those people that scoffed when Itakagi was fired from Temco and Hayashi took over the reins of the franchise. Sigma 1, while a nice visual  upgrade, was inferior to black and arguably the OG with the hurricane packs. Sigma 2 was a travesty. NG3 was an abomination and Yaiba killed the franchise.

But 11 years later,  NG3RE was a decent enough apology, even if still a polished turd, the master collection was at least an attempt to preserve the franchise and now we have a full remake of sigma 2 that while still not NG2 black, it's a good mixture of NG2 and sigma 2. If we ignore the graphicall enhancements, this would have been far more acceptable as the base for sigma 2 than what we got all those years ago.

Not only that but we are getting not one but two brand new Ninja gaiden games! A direct sequel to the OG series and NG4. Even if both of these games are DMC4-esque reboots they are still going to be the sole bright light in a sea in souls likes and Chinese action games that are fine in their own right, but haven't quite reached the heights of even the original OGs of the character action genre.

The reason I single out Hayashi, is because as head of team ninja, he must have been instrumental in getting these projects off the ground. Throughout all the souls like experimentation with Nioh, Metriod, wo long, Final fantasy and more recently with Rise of the Ronin, he clearly always wanted the team to return to their namesake, even though it would have been more prudent to just leave NG in the past. It was never a big seller and this franchise lives on purely on the prestige of one title and half of its sequel.

So credit is where it is due. I dont think Ninja gaiden will Capture Modern audiences like it did us and I really hate that these modern technologies make the games less fun to play (PSA - DO NOT RUN NB2B with any form of upscaling - it will cause input lag) but that being said, I have to commend team ninja for making the attempt. I've already purchased NG2B on steam and I will get the physical copy for my PS5. I'm also day one for NG4. At least for a brief period of time, this franchise and by extension character action games, live again and I just want to celebrate all and any who have made this possible.

PS - I hope fiend busa does come back to port NGS2B (The real one ) to this, but I understand that even with this, he has washed his hands of the whole thing and that is understandable. You can rest king



Edit: Turns out Hayashi isn't head of Team ninja anymore, he was promoted to head of the entertainment division at KT in 2022. That is not to say he probably did have a hand in making things happen but credit for this currently revival probably doesn't lie at his feet as much. My mistake. "

Most difficult bosses in the game imo,riseoftheronin,1i8le4s,2025-01-23 21:45:34,87,1.0,46,https://i.redd.it/dzbpzp8tuuee1.jpeg,AffectionateDig1276,Discussion,"This list is very subjective and most of you will most likely not agree but imo these 9 were a different breed, after playing through midnight difficulty twice this was the only list that felt right.

9. These 3 just barely snuck past yoshinobu who is very tuff on midnight mode, but on midnight difficulty this certain side quest changes. Instead of you helping those two fight kano, they all team up on you which makes this the only 3 on 1 boss fight in the game. Out of everyone on this list I think they killed me the most.

8. Bro I‚Äôm ngl this guy and soji are actually a different breed‚Ä¶ there attacks hurt and they are so quick it‚Äôs almost impossible to counter spark every attack, the shinsengumi is just built diff

7. Speaking of the shinsengumi‚Ä¶ THIS mf here. His arsenal is crazy. The blitz attacks, the long range strikes, the GUN. On midnight he hits you like 4 times before you die. I cannot stand him

6. Most people are goin to say he should not be this high or even should be on this list but hear me out, his flying attacks along with the constant bayonet shooting makes this dude lethal, if you‚Äôve ever trained against him yk his move set is too unpredictable. 

5. THE GOATü•π this may be a little bias but I did struggle with him very much. He has a moveset in which he uses his gun to send you back and then blitz you after that is literally impossible to counter spark. 

4. Man oh man. My majestic expulsionist. The ceo of nonstop attacks. From the first time you fight him in Yokohama to the last time at kinmon incident, he constantly improves and that dumbass dash he does is infuriating

3. Ok this is where I know people are going to disagree with me. For some this is the hardest boss fight in the game. And first play through I would agree. The blue demon is already a problem by himself. Add the red demon with him and it‚Äôs damn near a suicide mission. You need to be aware of where the other one is at the entire fight or you will NOT win. 

2. This placement should be obvious‚Ä¶ every fight they only added more to there arsenal, used a different weapon, due to the lore the game made it where they were the only person on par with your ronin. That final battle is not only beautiful, but does a good job of showing just how far you both have came. Still fck this boss fight especially on midnightüòÖ

1. This is actually the most infuriating fight in the game by far. Jules constantly shooting that dumbass gun at you if you‚Äôre fighting kondo is so annoying, and don‚Äôt even get me started on kondo, the dude is a tank who swings fast asf. I almost threw my controller cuz of that mf. 

Lmk who you guys think I missed or what you would change!

SR2's Territory allocation seems really weird and random,RealSaintsRow,1i8jxw0,2025-01-23 20:32:12,9,0.85,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealSaintsRow/comments/1i8jxw0/sr2s_territory_allocation_seems_really_weird_and/,BloodstoneWarrior,Saints Row 2,"Is it just me, or does the gang territory allocation in SR2 seem really random and haphazard compared to SR1's. In SR1 all the gangs controlled territory that made sense:

*  The Rollerz controlled the Suburbs and Apartments because they were mostly young rich kids, they controlled Chinatown because lots of the members of the gang are Asian and they controlled the Arena and Truckyard because they were focused on Cars. 
* The Carnalez controlled the Docks and Airport because they trafficked drugs to and from the city, they control the Barrio because they are a Hispanic gang and they control the Factories as they use them to produce their drugs. 
* The Vice Kings control the Projects as that's where King is from and where the gang originated, they control the Red Light District because they specialise in prostitution run by Tanya, and they control the majority of North Stilwater because they operate under the guise of legitimacy, running a record company and also working with the cops.

But in SR2 this is completely thrown out the window, with random districts now being assigned just so they all connect together on the map.

* The Brotherhood are the car gang and you even face off with Maero at the Ultor Dome, yet the arena district is controlled by the Samedi despite them never using it in missions (you get the Ultor Dome district during the 'Bad Trip' mission which happens in the Red Light District)
* The Ronin control the Suburbs despite the Samedi operating their drug labs nearby and also not really doing anything in that area - they only control the area because that's where Aisha lives so the early missions always start there. 
* The Ronin don't control the Airport despite operating out of there during the mission where you try to kill Kazuo - instead the Brotherhood own it despite not using it, at all. 
* The Brotherhood controlling the Apartments is explained in the game, but it still feels weird and out of place, why couldn't they swap the Apartments and Arena around and have the Samedi control the Apartments and Brotherhood control the Arena,
* The Ronin controlling almost the entirety of the north of the map, but only a sliver of the south really hurts the gameplay experience as you'll be fighting only the Ronin in the north of the map with them being essentially non existent in the south. 
* Surely the Ronin would have wanted to control Chinatown due to their existing beef with Mr Wong?

I think generally what each gang does in SR2 is far more vague and less fleshed out, as they rely more on aesthetics rather than who logically controls what in the underworld. "
