Haven't seen this posted here while I was looking for guides (namely wc3 gym nor on the  ""Getting Started"" link found in this subreddit.) It's a site I found lurking in Grubby's discord for build orders (it seems to have other stuff as well but I can only speak on the build order section).

I found myself disappointed from the lack of updated build orders, since I was returning from play over 20 years ago most, if not all, the build orders I found were the same from back then. Despite changes to the game that would (and do) effect best build orders and timings.

Things like:

* **Human**: the strength of Riflemen now from their buffs and Blacksmith lumber cost reduced.
* **Orc**: Greathall providing 11 food from 10 before, Headhunter buffs, Spirit Walkers being moved to Tauren Totem.
* **Night Elf**: Ultravision now requires t2, Glaive Thrower Buffs, AoW nerfed, Moonwell Buffs, Hero Buffs
* **Undead**: CL Buffs, Necropolis only cost 225 gold (no wood), Acolyte changes

There's more than the above, but those are just the ones off the top of my head that were changed that effect the build orders from 2003, yet I could only find Build Orders of 2003...

EDIT: Here is the ""Detailed 3 minutes of the Game"" from Moon I mention in the title. [https://wc3.no/#/buildorders/ffcf6c2e-784d-4efc-b045-5b0ca28d0a15](https://wc3.no/#/buildorders/ffcf6c2e-784d-4efc-b045-5b0ca28d0a15)

Optimism is an underlooked powerhouse in Ethereum.,ethtrader,1hwju8x,2025-01-08 08:07:34,17,0.92,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hwju8x/optimism_is_an_underlooked_powerhouse_in_ethereum/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Metrics,"When there's discussion about scaling solutions, I noticed that Optimism often takes a backseat to other L2s like Arbitrum or Base. Well, this post will show you that Optimism is far from a small player in DeFi. In this post I'll be analyzing the stats that justify why Optimism deserves more recognition.

First, the stablecoins market cap. It's at $1.38 billion right now, so there is a lot of liquidity on the network. The bridged TVL is $6.22 billion, Optimism has a lot of dominance in connecting assets across chains. In the past 30 days there are 1.25 million active addresses, so it has a very active user base.

Now I will break down the leading revenue generators over the past 30 days.

Number 1 is Velodrome (DEX). $1.93M in revenue. Velodrome‚Äôs is the most dominant DEX in Optimism.

Number 2 is Synthetix (Synthetics). $1.27M in revenue. I confess I didn't know about Synthetix, but it's a 'liquidity layer that powers an array of on-chain derivatives.'

Number 3 is Moonwell (Lending). $131,976 in revenue. Moonwell is a smaller contributor, especially because people prefer lending protocols on the Ethereum main net. But at least Optimism also supports different lending platforms.

Number 4 is Aave V3 (Lending). $116,840 in revenue. Obviously Aave needs no introduction. If you read my previous posts you know how dominant Aave is.

Number 5 is Toros (Yield). $76,996 in revenue. Toros is a yield farming protocol. My guess is this revenue is partially because of a campaign they launched which gave them exposure. Toros airdropped 10,000 OP every week for 5 weeks.

As you can see, Optimism is also a big player in Ethereum. It has good revenue stats and an active user base. One thing to note is that Optimism has very low transaction costs. Optimism proved its value as more than just another L2.

Is Elf the Weakest Race? Possibly and Some Ideas,WC3,1ho8jxg,2024-12-28 10:59:25,18,0.74,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/WC3/comments/1ho8jxg/is_elf_the_weakest_race_possibly_and_some_ideas/,AmuseDeath,Discussion,"I'm seeing a lot of people say Elf is the weakest race and while I won't say that conclusively, I do acknowledge some difficulties that Elves face as well as game design issues.

I think the two biggest issues that I see is the lack of quality of their T1 units and how bad they scale to T3 and the lack of air unit use despite having the most air units in the game.

The first issue I believe comes from the restrictive healing Elf has. Yes, they heal at night and yes they have Moonwells, but it is very restrictive and it really limits the mobility of the Elf race. Archers will always fall to AoE, no doubt about that and that can't be changed. Huntresses are more durable, but they lack the field healing the other races have. With that said, an idea I've floated in my head is a T1 healing item for Elf, maybe something called **""Nature's Essence""** that would work similar to Ritual Dagger for UD.

- item has 2 charges and when used, the player clicks on a tree, tree gets sacrificed and biological Elf units around the tree are healed X amount

So again, it's an Elf version of Ritual Dagger. It would give Elves more T1 healing, which would make their T1 units more viable. More importantly, it can be done on the field, so Elf players don't have to run their units all the way to base. 3/4 races have T1 healing items... I feel like Elves should get one too, to be fair.

The second topic is the Elf air units and the lack of their usage. IMO, the main issue is the sheer dominance of the Flying Machine and the Batrider that makes air units in general unable to be used. Flying Machines are the fastest units in the game at 400-speed, they do AoE damage at T2 and they do ranged damage. They are the best anti-air unit in the game and completely make air units unusable against HU. They are so good, they make Dragonhawks pointless. My hope is that their effectiveness is changed so air units are more viable against HU.

Batriders are the other problematic air unit as their ability cannot be responded to and when used, they give 100% of the experience to Orc and 0% to the other player which makes air also impossible to use against Orc.

This makes air units which Elves have 5 of, not usable in 2/4 matchups, which then forces Elf down the boring strategy of Bears and Dryads. Changing the Flying Machine and Batrider may allow Elf to gravitate beyond just these two units.

Again I want WC3 to be a fun game for every race, not just UD, in case you were wondering. Opening the game up for every race would be the goal. I'm also the one that advocated for all mechanical siege units to move faster (not just Meat Wagon). Thanks."

1. Find ""vault"" with highest rates
2. Try to interpret interest rates 
   1. Different protocols have different ways to calculate interest rates
   2. Interest rates are also variable so need to actively look at this; otherwise funds are underutilized
3. If lending USDC, need to get USDC on network for vault
   1. E.g. If USDC on Base has the highest interest rates, and you only have USDC on Arbirum, then you need to either swap or buy USDC on Base
4. Also need ETH on L2 to pay for gas fees
5. Receive tokens representing amount lended 
   1. Some protocols, like Moonwell, don't issue tokens representing your position. Instead, you need to manually check into their app to see interest accrued.

Problems:

1. Have to spend time finding highest interest rates and interpreting them correctly
2. Need tokens on appropriate network, so need to spend time swapping or purchasing tokens accordingly
3. Hard to monitor how well your position is doing since you aren't really notified about whether you money is being underutilized (e.g. out of target range)
4. Also hard to forgot your position exists when dApps, like Moonwell, require you to only view your position on their site

Moonwell (WELL) in the DeFi Cosmos: An Analysis of Utility, Market Dynamics, and Future Trajectories  
  
Abstract  
  
In the ever-expanding universe of decentralized finance (DeFi), Moonwell (WELL) emerges as a celestial body worthy of closer astronomical scrutiny. This analysis orbits around WELL's current market position, technological underpinnings, and the gravitational pull of its community and economic model. With WELL's price experiencing a supernova of activity, increasing by over 782% year-on-year, this study delves into the token's utility within its ecosystem, exploring mechanisms to create structural demand and mitigate the perpetual sell pressure from yield farmers. Through a synthesis of real-time market data, X posts sentiment analysis, and traditional financial metrics, we aim to chart WELL's trajectory amidst the volatile crypto cosmos. We examine its lending platform capabilities, the effectiveness of its governance model, and potential for institutional adoption. This abstract sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration, predicting whether WELL will become a central star in the DeFi galaxy or if it's just another asteroid in the vast financial space.

I also want to say I've been playing RTS since the beginning back when Dune 2000 was released and even some pre-RTS as a genre games whos names I don't remember right now. I also have played many RTS including this one at a semi-professional or professional level in the past

The fundamental issue that makes NE so bad is that its a race about removing things from the game. 
Lets examine units one by one:

* DH - mana burn removes mana from the game, evasion removes damage from the game
* KotG - entangle removes mobility and attack of enemy units. even removes using some items.
* hide - vision is removed
* Dryad - Dispell, pretty self explanatory. Also immune to magic entirely, so removes targets for 
spells as well. Slow poison removes regeneration and move speed and attack speed. All around a really 
NE characteristic unit. 
* moonwells - remove damage for free, remove mana loss for free, remove the possibly of dying entirely 
for free actually since the heal is instant and nothing deals enough damage to kill units in a single 
hit except really powerful spells on low HP units
* Wisp - detonation removes mana and spell effects and summons
* Staff of preservation - removes a unit from the battle near instantly

I could list more things but I think you get the point. NE is about removing things from the game, 
many of which are direct removals of what makes the game RTS to begin with. Not only is the race 
itself not very RTS, but playing against NE makes the game for the other player less RTS. Lets 
examine the most popular unit set, DH bear naga. 

DH + moonwells is so powerful early game its nearly impossible to kill a NE early except maybe tower 
rushing them. The NE player can immensely mess up their defense and still be ok because moonwells are 
so powerful at removing damage that units are taking. No other race has healing abilities so powerful 
in the early game, or even all game. Dying early is essentially not in the game for NE players and 
has been removed. At best, you can kill some wisps but at great risk due to having to walk past the 
tree buildings. Early game, you can get maybe 2 or 3 spells off against a NE player and that is it 
because mana burn removes your hero's mana to zero. Sometimes none. What is there left to do? Creep 
and wait until the NE leaves their base with bears. The entire early game is just not present against 
NE. They can't die. That entire part of RTS is just gone. The engagement with bears happens and what 
do they do? They just attack move because positioning doesn't matter due to the staff of preservation 
and the ability to quickly cast rejuvenation otherwise. Where is the part about RTS where you do much 
to improve the outcome of a battle? They simply aren't in the game anymore due to how NE works 
presently. Actually, you probably don't want to do much more as NE than rush headlong as fast as 
possible into the enemy and start mana burning and teleporting bears out of the battle as quickly as 
you can. The less mana the enemy has and the more you use moonwell mana the better the situation is 
for you as the NE player generally. And to make it all worse additionally, both players can know the 
entire game the NE player is making DH bear and nothing can be done about it like an RTS should have 
as an option. RTS is supposed to have mechanics that punish such predictable play. That is just basic 
strategy mechanics. This is just not in the game as well. All these things summed up, what is left in 
the game that is RTS when NE is one of the races? 

I'm surprised after all these years and an opportunity to change the game in major ways with the 
release of reforged, NE remains a drag on this game. Its a real shame because NE in general is pretty 
cool. The units are cool. But the gameplay just sucks. Playing NE is boring. Playing against NE is 
annoying, stupid, and boring. I would really like to see some of the other heros other than DH and 
KotG and I would like to see the other units as well. Every game is DH bear. Its really boring. 

Many changes to the race must happen for this game to improve. Just off the top of my head, the major 
changes that lead to many silly gameplay elements are: moonwells should heal over time like an 
obsidian statue or a priest or even a *gasp* fountain of health, staff of preservation has to be 
removed it is not RTS at all, bears should work like obsidian statues in that they cost resources to 
transform and they cannot transform back once transformed. Either that or drastically increase the 
amount of mana required to transform. Many other T3 non-hero spells require over 100 mana, why is 
transform into bear at 25 mana? Or something like make the spell similar to the spirit walker 
transform, where the shifting from etherial to material has a cooldown. 

Now that I think about it, bears in general make the moonwell problem even worse. Rejuvenation 
extends the mana of a moon well. It costs about the same amount of moonwell mana to heal 400 hit 
points given the cost of rejuvenation. Heal 400 HP, 200 moonwell mana. Heal 125 mana, 250 moonwell 
mana. I don't think a player is going to fuss over 50 mana. So a bear that is teleported to the base 
with a SoP will heal HP and pick up mana to take back to the battle. The bear is essentially 
extending the range of the moonwells. Rejuvenation heals really fast, really not much heals faster, 
the spell is pretty much a moonwell heal if you ask me. Are moonwells supposed to have map-wide 
range? No. 

NE is just horrible gameplay. To play and play against. Its annoying, stupid, and boring. And many 
nightelf players are total faggots too.

I haven't bumped into a single NE player yet who thinks the race is stupid. Random players agree. 
Almost everyone else says NE is stupid or doesn't want to comment for whatever reason. I ask nightelf 
players how NE is RTS. They can't answer. They say 'feels good' or 'bye' or some other verbal 
garbage.

I've had some games where I kill their AoW and archers while they are creeping with them and they 
still will not die in the early game. This is a catastrophic failure by them, or it should be. This 
is like an orc player losing their barracks. But moonwells are too strong. All they do is just run 
around their DH until moonwells have energy and then detonate wisps to take away your mana. No other 
race can fail so badly in the early game and not die. The one race that can kill NE early game that I 
know of is orc. And that is with a pretty prolonged bestiary and demolisher attack, until, guess 
what, moonwell energy runs out. That unit is so stupid and bad. and really, I think the only reason 
orc can do this is their high HP and ability to ensnare and prevent retreat into the trees. The other 
two races don't have this until late game at best. Like I said, NE just doesn't belong in the game. 
Doing the same thing all the time and being totally immune to losing until the mid game is not RTS. 
Its like as if a fighting game had a character that was immune to damage for the first 30 seconds of 
the match. Its just stupid. This isn't even some amazing play by the NE either. Walk up to a moonwell 
and heal instantly is all that is happeneing. 

Everyone playing this game for the last decade should be utterly embarrassed that NE hasn't changed 
at all. Its pretty clear at this point that everyone who doesn't think NE should be changed doesn't 
have the interest of this game in mind and wants to see bears and teleport staff until nobody plays 
this game anymore because of getting bored of the same thing over and over.

NE in general just feels wrong to play against. Its because it really shouldn't be in the game to 
begin with. 

The central problem with the race is the moon well. You can kind of think of many mechanics in the 
game as an abstraction of logistics. Hit points, mana, supply, build time, training time, etc. Even 
using items have timers. Moon wells are the one thing in the game that instantly and infinitely, as 
long as there is mana, manipulates one of the abstracted logistics. And its like an all at once 
thing. Even the most powerful spells like this, such as holy light or death coil, all have timers and 
a limit on how much they can manipulate at a time. Moonwells can spend all their mana at once if the 
target could use all the mana. This is a big reason why gameplay against NE is so silly and feels 
wrong compared to the other races. 

Anyone who thinks NE doesn't need to change: explain yourself. I'm really interested in hearing what you have to say."
Written into a Corner,Forgotten_Realms,1fknr6n,2024-09-19 11:33:58,6,0.75,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forgotten_Realms/comments/1fknr6n/written_into_a_corner/,HK_NarutoCJ,Question(s),"Hey folks!

Not sure if anybody here can help me, but I'm looking for some Forgotten Realms specific campaign advice. I'm running a campaign but trying to make it painfully accurate to the Forgotten Realms lore, and I've reached a section in my writing that I'm not sure I set up well for myself to follow canon lore or canonical items/history. Now, keep in mind, there is some creative differences that I've written in, but I'm trying to follow the lore as close as I can (especially when this is taking place past what I have seen lore of).

The party is currently tracking down the shards of divinity that were released around Faerun when Abdel Adrian and Viekang fought their fateful battle in Baldur's Gate. I've decided to (since it is rather vague, and from what reading I've done) opt to the idea of divinity scattering to likely places where it would manifest after it's vessel being destroyed (some older editions stated that was the case). After their battle, I believe the divinity would find pockets around Faerun (a fetch quest style campaign) where great tragedies are currently, or have in past occurred. These pockets are manifesting that divinity and keeping it alive, to be collected by the God of Murder, Bhaal, or in this case, to be collected by his previous vessel Sarevok. As Sarevok travels around Faerun seeking out these ""dark pockets"" and collecting the divinity in himself to build in power, the party needs to work actively against this. They are currently heading to the Moonshae Isles as they've heard that one of the Moonwells have been corrupted again due to the divinity of Bhaal being drawn to the Heart of Kazgoroth. The party will get there, have a chance to learn about the land, but eventually their goal will be to vanquish (which is hard to do with divine energy) or more likely capture the dark divinity that is there.

Now, the problem is, I have not thought of or seen any lore specific items that have the ability to capture or delete divinity. Maybe something that can even transfer it would work, but I'm looking for any advice before I start home brewing something. It doesn't need to be an official artifact, but I wasn't sure if anybody had read and remembered anything from a FR novel and could share that information with me!

Open to any and all recommendations! I am pretty stuck on this storyline, as the party has been working on it from the start (level 1) for the last 3 years and I could never take away the chance at succeeding in their long term adventure, but I will take advice and pointers on how I could handle this corner I've written myself into.

Thanks for reading, looking forward to seeing what you all have to say :)"

Anyone using Android/Apple Tablets for Crypto Onchain Trading when traveling?,CryptoMarkets,1es42ng,2024-08-14 11:09:03,2,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1es42ng/anyone_using_androidapple_tablets_for_crypto/,MannySignals,Support-Open,"I have a desktop at home which is the main device I use for productivity and crypto trading needs. I do travel a lot on the weekends and I use to be able to continue my trading with my laptop when on the go but it recently broke down. Now, I am thinking if I should buy a tablet instead of a laptop for portability if it can do all on chain crypto activities well. I find a laptop too bulky when on the go, battery life tends to be poor, and bringing out a laptop when in the company of friends and family I think kills the mood a bit.

I would like to ask if anyone here was able to settle with using and android/apple tablet for crypto on chain trading without having to sacrifice critical functionalities.

For context on my use case:

* I use CEXs (all have mobile apps) and DEXs a lot.
* I store all my tokens in hot wallets instead of cold wallets because I buy in and sell out frequently.
* I went 100% in ETH and SOL then use them as collateral in Kamino and Moonwell to borrow USDC. I then use the borrowed USDC for shitcoin on chain swing trading. Buying the crash then selling the bounce immediately to pay back my loans.
* I use crosschain bridges a lot like Jumper, Mayan, Orbiter, Synapse, Debridge, etc.
* Chains I use are Sol, ETH, ETH L2s, TON
* I track wallets on Cielo, Debank, Sonar, Step Finance
* I use Arkham and Coinglass for analytics

For the most part I think almost all of this can be done on mobile. One of the concerns is crosschain bridging. How will I crosschain bridge from BASE to SOL if the bridges require that I connect both wallets to the dapp? If I open the jumper bridge on the metamask mobile browswer, how do I then connect my Phantom solana wallet?

Are there any other use cases I will not be able to do when using a mobile operating system?"

Suppose King Mechagon managed to achieve global mechanization.,wowlore,1c559vt,2024-04-15 22:44:13,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wowlore/comments/1c559vt/suppose_king_mechagon_managed_to_achieve_global/,SleeplessShitposter,,"So I was thinking about this recently.

Suppose a team of five heroes fails Operation: Mechagon. King Mechagon sets off his doomsday device, all of Azeroth is now mechanized. Rolling strictly on what we know from WoW lore, not including Hearthstone, we have no idea what mechanization would do to an Old God, if anything.

Now, everything plays out as normal. A raid team of 25 mecha-heroes attack mecha-Azshara, N'zoth is released, mecha-Wrathion creates Asjra'kamas to offset madness, the mecha-Aspects unite, all that nice stuff. This makes me wonder if King Mechagon might have actually had a way to prevent every bad thing that's happened since, even if in a Halo-esque ""destroy all life to do it"" kind of way.

- Assumedly, N'zoth's influence on mecha-Azeroth may be weakened, assuming N'zoth isn't mechanized himself. The Curse of Flesh would be completely-reversed as well, so N'zoth's madness-spouting tumors would likely have no effect during his assaults. Hell, mechanization may even just kill N'zoth outright.

- With the magical power of centralized processing units and such, the ""restless Scourge"" would become the easily-reprogrammable Scourge workforce they were always meant to be. Bolvar is out of a job.

- Since nothing is actually a living being anymore, Zovaal's soul intake is COMPLETELY cut off. The deal with Sylvanas, now a robot, is OFF. He's DONE.

- Mechanical for the first time in their existence, the elves no longer need mana to survive. Moonwells and Sunwells close down, Tyrande no longer needs the tree. We never create anything for Fyrakk to burn.

These are all just guesswork, and I'm definitely wrong about most of these, but I can't imagine mechanization wouldn't have at least ccontributed to parts of my theories? Would global mechanization have been a net positive for Azeroth?"

I believe that Defillama struggles to get accurate data from different parts of the Polkadot chain, which is why its Total Value Locked (TVL) is lower compared to other chains. This is because there are so many parachains to collect data from.

For example, I manually check the staked value using Subscan Infrastructure by simply multiplying the staked DOT amount with its current price. You will get way higher number than what's presented on DefiLlama Platform. You can do the same for other parachains you're interested in.

I also took a look at the locked supplies in some DeFi platforms like Moonwell on Moonbeam parachains. In Market section, if you combine all Total Value Supplied you will get like \~$110m excluding staked WELL token while Defillama says Moonwell have 42m TVL.

It's clear to me that it's tough for Defillama to automatically gather all this data. If I were on the development team, I'd focus on easier chains to work with first.

Now, I understand why some people call Polkadot a ""ghost chain. It only because the mispresented data

**The 14th of Tarsakh 950 DR, Conyberry**

Mormesk, a wizard from the Wave Echo Cave, continues to covet my daughter Auglatha. His insistent pursuit of her hand in marriage is a vexation that I cannot abide. I have already relinquished one daughter to the mortal realm; Elara's marriage to the wealthy but common Gustav weighs heavily on my mind. I will not yield both of my daughters to such a fate as the thought of her becoming entwined in the affairs of mortals unsettles me deeply. I must find a way to dissuade Mormesk from his persistent advances without causing undue strife between our families. Auglatha's happiness and well-being are paramount, and I will not allow her future to be dictated by the whims of others.

May Sehanine Moonbow watch over us,

**The 27th of Nightal 950 DR, Neverwinter**

Elara and Gustav have been blessed with a son, whom they have named Anders Gustavson the First. The birth of my first grandchild brings both joy and concern. While I am elated at the prospect of a new generation within our family, the challenges of raising a child in these troubled times weigh heavily on my mind. I am resolved to provide a safe world for young Anders however, with the recent unsettling signs from the Moonwell, I need to be more vigilant than ever.

May Sehanine Moonbow watch over us,

*Quarion Melarue*

**The 2nd of Alturiak 951 DR, Melarue Keep**

The signs from the Moonwell trouble me greatly. The disturbances in the waters and the unsettling aura that emanates from it seem to mirror the persistent advances of Mormesk, the wizard from the Wave Echo Cave. Just as the waters of the Moonwell churn with unease, so too does my heart when I think of Mormesk's coveting of my daughter, Auglatha. I am reassured knowing that in times of danger, we have a place of refuge where we can seek safety away from the prying eyes of those who wish us harm. May Sehanine Moonbow watch over us.

May Sehanine Moonbow watch over us,

**The 15th of Ches 951 DR, Melarue Keep**

A calamity has befallen us. A young green dragon accompanied by a small army of kobolds, has launched a vicious attack on our keep. In the face of such overwhelming odds, we were forced to retreat to our sanctuary, seeking refuge from the wrath of the dragon and its minions. The safety of our family and the loyal inhabitants of the keep weighed heavily on my mind as we made our escape, and the decision to abandon our defences and seek shelter in the depths of the keep was a grave one.

Now, as we huddle in the safety of the sanctuary, I find myself contemplating our next move. The secret exit, known only to a select few, offers a slim chance of escape from the clutches of the dragon and its horde. However, the risks of venturing into the unknown, with the dragon's fury still raging above, fills me with unease. The fate of my family, the keep, and the loyal souls who look to me for guidance hangs in the balance as I grapple with the weight of this decision.

I will ask Sehanine Moonbow for what is the right course of action. My goddess, please, watch over us in this hour of darkness. Guide us in the path that ensures our survival and the preservation of all that we hold dear.

Cata Classic Feedback,wotlk,1akid28,2024-02-06 14:35:11,38,0.7,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/wotlk/comments/1akid28/cata_classic_feedback/,Tankre84,Discussion,"I've been playing Classic WoW for the last few years, and I'm really excited for Classic Cata. Here are a list of changes I think would make the experience much better!   


Part 1: Issues that have to be addressed: 

1a) Tol Barad needs the same treatment as Wintergrasp. Too many servers have faction imbalances. Tol Barad fight needs the same queued into a BG at specific hours system as WG. An additional needed changes is the fight should be 40v40 instead of 120v120. There's just too much lag for 120v120.

1b) Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest acquisition rate needs to be hastened. For the same reason Valanyr and Shadowmourne are faster and easier to get, Dragonwrath needs to be more accessible. 

1c) Molten Front Dailies, specifically to reach ""Filling the Moonwell"" needs to be shortened, simply because the timeline of Firelands will be hastened.

1d) Remove the 4.06 Nerfs to Heroic Dungeons ‚Äì Modern players are better and should deal with Heroic Dungeon Mechanics.

1e) Remove the guild perk ""Cash Flow."" This perk creates toxic guilds where the GM only wants as many people as possible in the guild so that they continue to farm the guild bank gold.

1f) Address 310% flying. In Original WOTLK, there were only a few mounts that were 310% flying. They were: Gladiator's, Al'ar, Mimiron's Head, Invincible, Violet/Black/Plague/Rusted/Ironbound Proto Drake, and Bllodbathed/Icebound Frostbrood (Maybe I'm missing 1 or 2). Anyways, everything else was 150% or 280% flying. Cata made the changes:   
\- All mounts scale to your fastest speed.  
\- If your character owned one of the 310 mounts, they would earn 310 flying. Everyone else had to pay 5,000G to train 310 flying after training 280 flying.  
\- Afterwards, then they made all mounts account wide bound.

Now the issue with Classic is how to handle step 2 of training 310 flying if you already have 310 Account Wide Mounts on Alts who did not earn the mounts. The three potential solutions would be:  
\- Grandfather in 310 flying for a characters who have the achievement for earning one of the above mounts. (probably most fair, but also might be most difficult to do)

\- Grandfather in 310 flying for all characters that have ever rode a 310 flying mount. This is a nice freebie for people with lots of alts.

\- Force everyone to have to train 310 flying regardless of whether or not they had a 310 mount beforehand. This is the worse solution, please do not go with this solution.  


1g) Remove or greatly increase the weekly Valor Cap ‚Äì Back in Original Cata, a player could earn Valor through random heroic dungeons or raids, but there was a weekly cap to this. Throughout the expansion the cap shrunk and grew. This created a situation where some tiers you had to run RDF weekly dungeons to valor cap and other tiers the valor is already capped from the current raid tier. I think a fair and consistent system should simply be: Only the most current raid drops Valor. Previous tiers of raid drop Justice. Valor can be earned from the current raid tier. In addition, 5-7 random dungeons must be run each week to reach the full valor cap. Bonus Valor from the random dungeons being done on Alpha/Beta/Mythic+. This is pretty close to our current WOTLK system. 

Part 2: Changes most can agree to:   
2a) Continue to make Alpha/Beta dungeons, or even better Mythic+ dungeons. I believe most players really enjoyed the Alpha/Beta/Gamma dungeons of WOTLK, so please keep this going. Mythic+ dungeons is one of the best parts of Retail WoW, so that would be welcome as well. If we get Mythic+ dungeons, the weekly chest rewards should only drop random ring, neck, bracer, boots, or belt.

2b) Reinstate the 3.2 WOTLK versions of LFG ALONG SIDE of RDF. Players like RDF, but they hate the new UI for making a group for anything else. Alternatively, give us the Retail WoW UI for LFG.

2c) Several Archeology Changes:

\- Remove the cap of 200 fragments. Cata released with no fragment caps. Later on, a 200 fragment cap was added to prevent players from pooling a bunch of fragments waiting to hit 450 Archeology. This change just made archeology a longer and worse grind. Revert this change. 

\- 5 Digsites available at any given time and at least 1 always active in Tol'vir. Not having an active digsite in a Cata region at any given time simply sucks. 

\- Keystone Fragments should be tradeable and play a much stronger roll in Mythic+ or Alpha/Beta Dungeons. This creates a reason for people to keep doing Archeology at max level even after they have all the BOA's.

\- Release Extinct Turtle Shell with launch. This shield has the same 359 Ilvl as all the other epics from Archeology, so it makes no sense to release it with the Zandalar dungeons. Just release it at the same time as the other epics.

2d) An option to have Retail UI (not mandatory) ‚Äì The Retail UI is a lot cleaner and better. Please allow players to check a box in Classic to be able to turn on Retail UI. 

2e) Retail Auction House - the UI for the AH in Classic is just outdated. Just give us the retail AH.

2f) Increase the speed to level fishing. Maybe 1 skill points per cast guaranteed. 

  
2g) Make Epic Gems more accessible ‚Äì In WOTLK a player can transmute epic gems, prospect titanium ore, or use badges and honor to buy epic gems. This is a good system. In Cata, players get a resource from Dagonsoul Bosses which lets them buy around 2 epic gems per a week. This is a bad system. Having to ration your epic gems feels bad. Keep the WOTLK method and add a new transmute for epic gems. Make a chance for Pyrite Ore to prospect into epic gems, and allow players to buy them with Justice/Honor.

2h) Reduce the amount of trash in Heroic Dungeons by around 25%-30%. Heroic Dungeons should be difficult, but not overly long. One appeal with WOTLK dungeons is that they're short. Cata dungeons on the other hand are all long and packed with trash. Cutting out 1/4th to 1/3rd or the trash packs would make the experience better. 

Part 3: Controversial changes I will argue for: 

3a) Wait 2-3 weeks to launch Tier 11. Waiting a month or so into the new expansion to launch the first raid tier started in MoP. Because Tier 4 and Tier 7 were so incredibly easy, it made sense to launch them with BC and WOTLK week 1. Tier 11 will be the hardest tier in Classic to date. Having leveling be part of the race for Tier 11 is going to create an overly stressful situation for most players. Having reputation grinds and heroic dungeons be the ""progression"" for 2-3 weeks is also good for having a full world.

3b) Nerf H Spine of Deathwing to the ground. Spine of Deathwing was a fight that broke up several guilds. The DPS requirements of bursting down each section was so high that raids had to stack Arcane Mages and Rogues with Legendries. This lead to a lot of higher end guilds poaching players from other guilds. Many, many guilds broke apart after spending Firelands setting up their mages with Legendries just to see these mages leave for another guild. Many loyal players of the high end guild were upset to be benched just so the guild can bring in an Arcane Mage with a legendary. This single fight caused the collapse of many social bonds in WoW. The worse part is, the fight is not even one that is considered fun or enjoyable. The way I would fix this is make Bloodlust/Timewarp/Heroism available on every section of the Spine. People love the feel of DPS'ing with the haste buff. Make is so that killing one section resets the exhaustion debuff.  


3c) Nerf H Rag 25 some. This fight was also a ""guild killer."" I would argue that many players on Retail no longer enjoy Mythic Raiding because it's just too hard and unforgiving. H Rag 25 is near that level. Killing a guild in a MMO is simply bad business. I remember two main nerfs to Rag. The first one came midway that reduced the health during P1 (the boring phase). The second nerf came right before Dragon Soul and was a major nerf. I believe H Rag 25 should follow this time schedule: 

Week 1-2 ‚Äì Original Hardest Difficulty 

Week 3-4 ‚Äì Phase 1 Nerf 

Week 5 and beyond ‚Äì Dragon Soul prepatch nerf. This way the HC guilds still get to fight it on the hardest difficulty, and the semi-HC guilds will get to H-Rag right around the time of the nerf. I think this is akin to the Kael/Vashj nerf, which is better than the Ulduar system which never got nerfed. 

3d) Slight balancing to 10M Heroic vs 25M Heroic. I've done all the fights on Heroic in both 10M and 25M. They are supposed to be equally balanced, but there were a few really bad outliers.

\- HC Halfus 10 was unfairly hard on 10HC compared to 25HC. I recommend something simple like: nerf emerald whelps and storm rider drake's health by 5% and damage by 10%. 

\- HC Nef 10H was also harder than 25HC. I recommend something like Animated Bone Warriors do 10% less damage in P1. 

\- Buff all of Firelands 10 HC. On the flip side compared to 25 HC Firelands, 10M was completely under tuned. I would buff the HP of everything in 10M HC Firelands by around 8%.

3e) Timewalking Raids ‚Äì This is another amazing thing in Retail that I would love to see implemented into Classic. This was also one of the questions in the Blizzard Survey. Honestly Timewalking Raids as a weekly quest instead of LFR would just be amazing.

3h) Cross Faction/Cross Server Raiding ‚Äì There's simply just so many players that say they're quitting after WOTLK that I think allowing all players in a region (NA or EU or Asia) to play with each other would help maintain the population. A lonely and empty MMO is its own death spiral. 

3i) Warmode ‚Äì Introduced in Legion, Warmode turned all servers into PVE servers, but anyone on any server can turn on PvP mode with perks.

3j) Racial Accessibility ‚Äì Anyone who played beyond knows that within the next few expansions  the faction balance will be completely broken. While Human racial is definitely OP for PvP, Orc and Troll Racial will dominate PvE DPS. Some people have argued for the removal of racial bonuses, however since that has never happened, how's about letting players drop their own racials and gain access to other racials? You can tie it a reputation, an achievement, or a cost. 

For instance: Maybe a BE could gain the Orc Racial once they are exalted with Orgrimar. They of course could only have 1 set or racials at a time. They would have to give up their BE racials to gain the Orc Racials. Maybe a gnome could gain the Orc Racial once they have the achievement for Killing Thrall. A Tauren can get the HU racial by killing Wrynn. A lot of Cata and beyond revolves around serious DPS checks. If SoD can find a way of giving Paladin buffs to the Horde and Windfury to the Alliance, please find a way of balancing out the racials for Cata!

   
Part 4: My super special recommendation: 

HC SELF FOUND CATA: The biggest tragedy of Cata was that so much work was put into redoing Azeroth, and most people barely got to see it because leveling was so fast and easy or people already had their level 80 characters. Players are constantly asking for Vanilla 2.0, when really Cata has already done it. On the flip side the HC servers were a massive hit for a while, but what you always see is that they quit after enough deaths or they reach max level and quit because raiding in HC is pretty insane.

Enter: CATA HC SELF FOUND 

\- All EXP gain is decreased by 40%

\- Players cannot gain bonus exp from Heirlooms, JJ, or BG weekends. 

\- Players do 50% less damage against all mobs. Players take 33% extra damage from all mobs. 

\- NO AH, NO MAILING, NO TRADING, no heirlooms.

\- Players are phased so only other players in this HC Self Found mode will be in the world. 

\- Upon reaching level 60 players receive the title ""of the Shattered World"" and a Black and Red (similar to Deathwing's colors) racial mount. 

\- Leveling 60-85 would be back to normal, and they could smoothly transition into the Cata raiding endgame.

\- If you die, you do not have to delete your character, but that character is removed from the HC challenge. This mode would probably entice enough people to actually do all the new quests in the shattered Azeroth, and they would probably be enticed to do it several times for each racial mount. "

As expected of the recent balance patch which buffed HU and Orc, HU and Orc seems to fare best overall.

Elf got a moonwell nerf. As expected, Elf overall does the worst out of the 4 races.

The top 6 are all non-elves. And elves are all shoved to the end of the rankings.

&#x200B;

We also note some interesting (and delightful) changes this patch. For instance, in recent times, Fortitude is destroying every Undead. Honestly, it might be well deserved and it might be that in the past, Undeads have just been benefiting too much from an improperly balanced matchup. Maybe the matchup is more fair now and we are seeing the more skilled player actually blossom for once.

Congratulations to HU players for becoming much better players. Congratulations also to all the Orc players overall who also have become much better players.

Turns out all the effort of hard work suddenly changed a lot of results in just over 1 season which just happened to have a new balance patch.

And to all the Night Elves. What's wrong with you noobs? Your best player is ranked lower than the 3rd UD in warcraft3 elo rankings. And that's after xlord has long retired for years. What a bunch of pathetic noobs.

Anyways, congratulations to Fortitude to have improved a lot more in the recent months out of the two decades of WC3 history. Also congratulations to Lyn for doing well again in the recent months.

And congratulations to all the UDs in the pro scene. You guys are all better than all the pro Elves in this game in the recent months.

&#x200B;

On a more personal note, I long gave up caring about NE vs UD balance overall. I am just going to support whatever changes can result in Lyn and Romantic to crush UDs going forward. Sick and tired of the past 4 years of unwavering support from certain influencers in this game resulting in a total domination from one player. It's been feeling like money laundering for some time now. Nice to see a change finally.

I remember runing in ghost form through entire zone. I remember actually having to hit mobs several times in order to kill them. I remember waiting in front of the dungeon for people to show up in order to do it. And not to mention world PvP that slows you down even more.

So why? Why is it hard to me to take 6 vials through portals and fill them up with moonwell waters in order to get my druid cat form? I have these 6 vials in my backpack for days and still can not make myself do the run. Is it a ME problem? Have I got too lazy in my older days? Or have we all became spoonfed with easier and easier ways of doing...well everything. And then Blizzard throws in these secret ""quests"" that resemble a old WoW and I can not do it yet. I keep postphoning it every time I look at vials. 

Not even gonna speak about lazy storytelling, that is like beating dead horse. I guess this is more of a question for people who enjoy classic even tho it is approaching dangerously the easiness of retail. How you guys come back to it? Cause I could not."
"Demon Hunters, Felsworn, Fel-Corrupted, and Blood Drinkers: How are they similar, and why are they different?",warcraftlore,17yd1wq,2023-11-18 13:46:52,13,0.94,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/17yd1wq/demon_hunters_felsworn_felcorrupted_and_blood/,NewWillinium,Discussion,"So this has been something that has interested me pretty early on in the lore, from the first time we ever saw the Fel Orcs in Ashenvale where Grom turns red and gets glowing magenta eyes, and going forward to what we have now with the Demon Hunters of the Illdari. 

What is Fel Corruption and why does the method of said corruption change how it transforms the effected in such different ways? 

And so I've broken this down into a few categories, starting with the Orcs who consumed the blood of Mannoroth, and ending with the Demon Hunters. 

**-][-**

**[Blood Drinkers](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/b/bf/Rise_of_the_Horde.jpg)** : So when the Orcs first drank the blood of Mannoroth they were a people whose skin-tones ranged the color of the dirt. Rich browns and blacks and whites of sand. When the leaders of the Nascent Horde first drank the Blood of the Pit-Lord Mannoroth. This resulting first drink of the Cup of Unity changed in a rather dramatic fashion. Which I luckily have the source in hand to quote now. 

> Grom did not hesitate. He brought the cup to his lips and drank deeply. Durotan watched, straining to see the reaction. Perhaps,
after all. the letter had not been sent by someone who wished him good; perhaps it had been a trap‚Äî
Gul'dan barely had time to take the chalice from Grom before the other orc stiffened and shuddered.

> He doubled over for a moment, and the crowd murmured in worry. Durotan stared, horrified, as Grom's hunched-over body pulsated and quivered. Before his eyes, Grom's shoulders, slender for an ore's, broadened. His armor creaked as it settled over this newly powerful body. Slowly, Grom straightened. Tall as ever he had been, reshaped by the green liquid to be stronger and thickly muscled, he looked out over the crowd.

>What Durotan could see of his face was smooth and healthy and, save for the tattooed jaw . . . completely green.
Grom threw his head back and shrieked again. 

>The cry was louder than Durotan had ever heard it. It was almost like a knife made of sound that ripped through one's body and left
one shattered and bleeding. Durotan covered his cars, as did nearly everyone else, but he could not tear his gaze from Grom's face.
Grom's eyes now glowed red.

>""How do you feel, Grom Hcllscrcam, of the Warsong clan?"" asked Gul'dan with a peculiar mildness.
Grom's expression of ecstasy was so keen it was almost pain, and he seemed to grope for words. ""I feci... magnificent! I feel..."" He
broke off and screamed a third time, as if only the primal cry would do. ""Give me draenei flesh to tear and rip! Draenei blood on
my face... I will drink it down until I can hold no more! Give me their blood! 

> . . .And the eyes of every one who drank turned a blazing red

Their body structure changed to be stronger, broader, more powerful then before, this feat extending not just to their muscles but their lungs as well. Skin changed from a warm brown to a bright fel-green, and their eyes glowed Red. The Skin of the Orcs had already been changing to green before this period, from Fel-Radiation, but the actual consumption of the Blood of the Pit Lord changed absolutely and immediately. 

And we know that this is not the only change that comes from drinking the Blood of Demons. 

Later on, the so called [""Fel/Chaos Orcs""](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/2/2d/Blood_Guard_Porung.jpg) appear later on. Again with Grom Hellscream drinking from the Fel-Well, a Corrupted Moonwell that had the Blood of Mannoroth poured into it, binding him and his Warsong Clan to Mannoroth's will. [His skin turned a deep scarlet red, his body bulked up even further more with strength and fury unbound but chained to the will of Mannoroth](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3a/PossesedGrom.jpg). Their eye color seems to go the Glowing Magenta or more typical Fel-Green flames, not entirely sure why, and they are prone to boney rocky growths across their bodies. 

An odd exception to this rule seem to be the Fel-Orcs of Alternate Draenor, where instead of going bright red they turn grey-skin tone and instead get . . .these [Fel-Flame infusions](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/04/Kilrogg_Deadye_WoD_HC.jpg) akin to a Fel-Sworn? Blackhand looks somewhat similar, but rather then be Fel-Infused he looks as if he was infused with flame akin to the Dark Iron Dwarves from his conflict with the furies. 


And you'd think that this would be it for the Blood Drinkers right? 

But there's one more important example to point to before we move on to the next category. The Felblood-Elves/Felves. 

The Felves were followers of Kael'thas Sunstrider & Kil'jaedan who were rewarded with their efforts to the Fel Horde and were allowed to gorge themselves on the blood of Demons for several days.This transformed them in a way rather similar to the Orcs, but [distinct](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e7/Felblood_elves.png). A Variety of skin-shades, small-wing Growths, sharp cuspids like a Vampire, glowing Fel-Green Eyes, Horns, and cracks in their skin showing their-fel-infused blood glowing beneath and through their skin.  I'm putting a note in this, but keep in mind that the Felves are a interesting middle ground. 

**Fel-Corruption**: This is the most ambiguous category because of how Fel-Energy works. The most benign Fel-Corruption to be seen has been the slow turning of the skin of the Orcs prior to and after the Cup of Unity, even among those who did not and refused to drink, and the Fel-Green eyes of the Sin'Dorei Elves from the usage of Fel-Infused Crystals in the city of Silvermoon. Just being around the Fel, Fel-Users, or places where Fel was used or is actively being used can change the ones living in or around the area because of how the energy radiates outward. Best exemplified with [these two here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/4a/BloodElvesSots.jpg). 

In regards to the Draenei, specifically the survivors of Shattrath who were infected with the Red Mist Plague, the Fel-Energies also cut them off from the Light and deformed their bodies in rather consistant manners. The [Ko'Krun/Broken and the Lost](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3e/DraeneiDevolution.jpg). On a side note, I still kind of wish that the Broken became a Playable race instead of the Lightbound Draenei. 

**Unknown:** To this day I am unsure as to how the [Man'ari](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/b/bc/Man%27ari_Draenei_1.jpg) became as they are. These people who were once Draenei have taken many many different forms of Demonic Shapes, clearly the results of different kinds of corruption and transfer and manipulation, but as far as I can tell the actual fel-corruption of the likes of [Kil'Jaedan](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/8/81/Kiljaeden_Sunwell.jpg) (Who seems to fluctuate between Flame eyes and Fel-Flame Eyes and adornments), Archimonde, or their followers has never actually been detailed in full unlike most of the others. 

I am also unsure as to whether or not to count the [Nether Dragons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nether_dragon) as being Fel-Corrupted or not, and if so what kind of corruption? They are of the Twisting Nether itself.

**Felsworn:** There are also the [Satyrs](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/ea/Xavius_TCG2.jpg) who fit a kind of middle line between being Fel-Sworn and Fel-Corrupted, as the first Satyr was turned into such as a punishment (and yet are the Demons/Demon-Kind who most closely resemble Sargeras) and are important to note as another middle ground like the Felves. 

Other then the Satyrs those who swear themselves to the Burning Legion, and are in turn granted power, they honestly tend to have a pretty tame and consistant change to them. From the [Valkyr](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/90/Skovald.jpg) , [Tauren](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/95/Tugar_Bloodtotem.jpg), [Nightbourne](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Felborne_Spellbreaker.jpg), [Harpies](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/44/Feltalon_Ripper.jpg), and [Humans](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3b/Melris_Malagan2.jpg) the Felsworn all tend to get a Green glow to them, Green Eyes, fel-flames somewhere on their body, and a fel-glow from within their bodies exuding outward. It's *odd* to me that this is so consistent, but I've never been able to find a description going into how or why it is so nor how it is done (like what is the power being granted to them?). 


**Demon Hunters**: Finally we come to the Demon Hunters. 

The Demon Hunters are interesting to me because they, on a permanent basis, do what Warlocks can do with the Metamorphosis ability but on a more permanent basis.  

This Transformation first showed up in Warcraft 3's main campaign after Illidan Stormrage consumed the Skull of Guldan, to this day I'm still not sure how or why drinking the soul of Gul'dan (A Orc) let him do this, and it allowed him to turn into [this](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/f2/IllidanDemon.jpg). Basically a shadowy Dreadlord looking being whose steps trailed fel-fire. Warcraft 3 Reforged has gone back and turned this initial form into [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/631327191841505280/1070866989490393138/image.png?ex=65692c1a&is=6556b71a&hm=5ad90c8b0c8a02f4bcd1c386b1d3f9b4fd7cbcd3a580a30de34cb47ceebf9818&) more familiar image. Still shadowy, but in a form we are more used to over the years. 

Like a Satyr he has grown great curling horns and hooves, like the Felves he has grown great leathery wings, sharp claw like fingers, glowing fel-green eyes, and glowing tattoos. 

[The Demon Hunters](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/6a/Demon_hunter_Gamescom1.jpg) cross the line of being Fel-Corrupted into becoming *Demons* in and of themselves, their more Demonic forms being split between the (for gameplay purposes) the [Havoc](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/44/Male_Blood_Elf_Havoc_Metamorphosis.jpg) and [Vengenace](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/6c/DH_Tank_Male_03_PNG.png) forms. 

And this is because, and do forgive me unlike with the Rise of the Horde Quote I do not have the Illidan novel on me to quote that transformation in the book, the Demon Hunters do not just consume Fel-Energy or Demon Blood, nor do they get infused. 

The Demon Hunters gain their mutated states by consuming the Blood, The Heart, and the Soul of a demon. I believe the Demon used in the book is a felhound.

Luckily enough, thanks to Hearthstone, we also have some visual references for what non-Night and Blood look like when they go through the Demon Hunter training and transformation. 

[Karnuk the Fel Orc](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/hearthstone_gamepedia/images/f/fc/Karnuk%2C_Demon_Hunter_full.jpg). [Felarin the Felve](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/6b/Felerin%2C_the_Forgotten_HS.jpg), [Sklibb the Sporeling](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/hearthstone_gamepedia/images/a/ac/Sklibb%2C_Demon_Hunter_full.jpg), and [Shalja the Naga](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/hearthstone_gamepedia/images/2/27/Shalja%2C_Demon_Hunter_full.jpg). 

Oddly enough Felarin goes from a Felf to a Night Elf looking man like Illidan, actually almost akin to what I imagine a Demon-Hunter Malfurion would look like, and Shalja barely seems to change at all. 

And though he himself is not a Demon-Hunter, I would like to note Kathenred Ebonlocke for going under a very similar transformation as Illidan Stormrage. 

Including both the [Initial Shadowy transformation](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/92/Kanrethad_Demon.jpg) and the [more visually realized form like Illidan's default](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/f6/Demonic-Infusion-by-Kerem-Beyit.jpg). This change came about from absorbing too much Fel-Energy, and the man came out of his apotheosis with. . . honestly the **Exact** same plan as Illidan Stormrage planning on using the Council of Black Harvest as his own personal Illidari. He was changed back from this form, by siphoning the Fel-Energy from his body. 

Could one do the same to Illidan and the rest of the Ildari? Or was that just because said transformation only came about through massive amounts of fel-energy, rather then the consumption of blood and flesh and soul? 

**-][-**

These are all of the major examples that I can think of showing and displaying Fel-Corruption and Transformations in their many many forms, not going into the many Man'ari types. 

If I missed any do feel free to add them below, or if you happen to have that Illidan book quote I would love to see it once again.

Do y'all have any thoughts on Eel-Corruption and it's many forms?  Or just thoughts in general?"
Cosmological Corruption: What mutations occur when one is infused with too much of a certain energy source?,warcraftlore,17s4xrl,2023-11-10 09:16:59,9,0.81,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/17s4xrl/cosmological_corruption_what_mutations_occur_when/,NewWillinium,Discussion,"This is actually been something that has been on my mind for. . .well honestly ever since Warcraft 3 came out and we got to play as Grom and his boys after drinking from the corrupted Moonwell with Manneroth's blood poured into it. 

How the already green-skinned Orcs turned from their corruptive Green to hulking Red beings with spikes coming out of them, *more* teeth growing, and their eyes turning to a flaming purple. 

And that's honestly kind of fascinated me ever since. 

And as the years have come and gone, and as more and more and more WoW lore has come out, we've come to learn more about how the universe works and what all of these energies can do to a person. But as a fan who has mostly seen it from the outside in, only cursory attempts at WOW itself while being initially really into the books up to a certain point because I couldn't afford the subscription services, I wsa hoping to see what I might be missing from what I do know and what few trawls into the lore I have done.

**-][-**

**Fel**: Fel corruption seems to take place in different stages and changes drastically depending on the species that is being infused with it. The Orcs of Draenor having their eyes turn red and their brown skin green (Except in Alt-Draenor where it gave them fel-green explosive veins like the soon to be mentioned felsworn?) with deeper infusions of it turning their green skin red, spiky growths, teeth growth, and flaming *purple* eyes. 

Then we have the classical Satyrs who were created as a kind of curse after Sargeras punished Hibourne Night Elf Xavias for his failure during the War of the Ancients, and most bemusingly to my eyes the Satyrs look nearly *identical* to Sargeras himself. Just replace his flaming great mane for hair and boom, Giant Satyr. They can apparently pass this curse along to others both biologically and magically? 

Going further we have Illidan and his Ildari Demon Hunters who, by consuming the soul(Spirit?) of a powerful demon, gained the powers and knowledge of the demons themselves. So Horns, Tattoos, Wings, Hooves, chance to lose control and go on a rampage. I am still rather confused as to how Illidan consuming *Gul'dan's* Skull turned him into a Demon Hunter though. Was the Old Warlock just ***that*** infused with Fel energy without turning red? Was it something Deathwing did to the skull? Because it went through the Dark Portal so many times? 

Felsworn: This seems to vary depending on the individual? As Xavius was technically a Felsworn before being turned into a Satyr, The Iron Horde had the fel-green eyes and veins arcing across their bodies, The Felskorn Vulkyr had that plus the horns. Being gifted the power directly really does seem like the most stable of these corruptive forms. The Tauren oddly enough seem to just get the eyes and a kind of . . .green glow around their extremities, some bone growths around their hands, larger antlers, and fire on their hooves and tails. 

Finally we have the Felblood Elves and the Eredar. Elves: Blood Elves who initially started out with the Fel-Green eyes and later on kept consuming more and more Fel from a more direct source. This leads to them growing small horns, glowing runic tattoos, vampire-esque teeth, small wings, and their skin changing color to scarlet red taupe grey purple and anything in between. The Felblood Elves honestly seem to get off pretty lightly consuming the Fel all things considered. Mayhaps it's because of how adaptive they as a species are to magic resulting from their descent from Troll-Kind? 

Finally we come to the Man'ari Eredar who. . .Honestly for the *most* part just look like Red Draenei. It's when you go further into the sub-groupings of Eredar that the true mutations show. The Wraithguard with their toed feet and horns, and lack of facial tendrils and tails. The ""Eredar Brutes"" who got the Fel-Orc treatment of hulking muscles, spiky growths, lack of tails, and lack of facial tendrils. The Doommaidens, who as best as I can tell are just Fem-Eredar, who got to have wings *and* keep their tails. 

And then going back to Warcraft 3 we have the Broken. The Draenei who were corrupted by the Fel Magics of the Orcs and have evolved/degenerated into Plankton people. They lost their colorful hues, their teeth had turned into sharp daggers with no lips, they lost their tails and horns. The Broken seem to have gotten it the *worst* out of every variation out there, and I have no idea why they got hit so badly by the Orc's corruption when others didn't. 

**Light**: For the Light I really only have a couple of examples, and that comes from the ever scheming Nathrezim and the Light-Forged. The Light-forged Draenei have golden eyes, golden tattoos, golden embellishments on their hooves (an affection or part of the mutation?) and lighter alabaster skin. The Lightbound Orcs getting similar changes to them.

Lothraxian the Nathrezim, A Dreadlord who was infused with the light. Gone are his horns, grey skin turned stark white and flowing from within, his eyes and very being emanating a golden glow, as even his wings are turned Golden with the Light. 


**Void**: So the most obvious example of Void corruption is the Curse of Flesh, that turned the Earthen and Mechagnomes into the Dwarves and the Gnomes respectively. The Void Elves had their skin turned pale, their blood purple, and have the ability to take on a ""void"" form which empowers them turning their physical beings into a rich purple or deep black appearance. Once again the Malleability of the Elves pulls through. Similarly the Highbourne Elves were turned into Naga by one of the Old Gods of the Void, these are perhaps the most *extreme* Elven transformation in the lore, with the Elves turning from Bipdeal humonoids to Serpentine beings with elven upper bodies (mostly). The Female Naga look as gorgeous as before, though changed, with additional limbs on the torso and tendril hair. The Male Naga on the other hand were turned into. . .well hulking Brutes looking more akin to Monsters then the Elves they were before. Though they vary wildly in shape and scale, the Naga seem remarkably stable for a species so deeply touched by the Void and Madness. 

The Nerubians are Giant Arachnid Centaurs beings sprang forth as servants of the Old Gods but later *rebelled* so unfortunately we don't really have a baseline for what they looked like during the age of the Black Empire and if at all they looked like prior to the Old Gods. 

**Arcane**: Insofar as I know we really have only a single example of Arcane corruption/transformation in the series and that is with the Etherials. Beings who were transformed by Arcane energies into beings of pure. . .well Arcane still sentient and sapient, but are whirling whirlwinds of energy covered in clothing armor and rags. 

*Maybe* the glowing eyes with no pupils and a solid color are also something arcane, but that seems to be a big question mark as best as I can tell.

**Elemental**: So we have a example of someone being bathed in the energies of the elements and those who have been *infused* with the Elements. On the former we have Ritssyn Flamescowl who after being bathed in the energies of Ragnoros now has flaming eyes, a mane of flame around his head, and as far as I can tell that's about it. On the Primalist side of things we see beings who appear mostly the same as they were but. . . more elemental? Rocky/Icey/Fiery/Lightningy growths, bodies changing to mobile stone or solid winds or what not.  They're basically what I imagine life would have looked like on Azeroth before the Old Gods or Titans had grabbed hold of it and started meddling. We also have the Djaradin who used to be Earth Giants before being infused with the Elements. They are somewhat-fleshy beings with elemental tattoos(?). 

**Death**: I can actually only think of Arthas who was naturally corrupted through the usage of Frostmourne, where it drained the pallor from his skin and hair, made him gaunt, and seemed to drain the positive emotions from him (mostly? There's that bit where he is confronted by his more humane self represented as himself as a child and Ner'zhul?) and I'm not too sure what else changes with the slide into undeath other then that.

**-][-**


And as far as I can tell that's just about it. Though I am 100% positive that I have missed most of the examples somehow.

Are Nightelves Actually Not Addicted To Magic?,warcraftlore,17mmrxx,2023-11-03 00:17:49,36,0.85,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/17mmrxx/are_nightelves_actually_not_addicted_to_magic/,Kalthiria_Shines,,"So I had a though - Moonwells, which contain magic from Elune and water from the new Well of Eternity, are central to Nightelven towns. They also are strong sources of magic. 

So the question I've got for you is: Are nightelves actually *free* from addiction to magic? Or do Moonwells fill the same role as things like the Sunwell and the Nightwell?"
Classic Cata Feedback and Recommendation,classicwow,17lfsyy,2023-11-01 12:18:44,0,0.48,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/17lfsyy/classic_cata_feedback_and_recommendation/,Tankre84,Discussion,"I‚Äôve been playing Classic WoW for the last few years, and I‚Äôm really excited for Classic Cata. Here are a list of changes I think would make the experience much better!

Part 1: Changes we should expect to happen:

1a) Tol Barad needs the same treatment as Wintergrasp. So many servers have faction imbalances. Tol Barad fight needs the same queued into a BG at specific hours system as WG.

An additional needed changes is (assuming the fight will be 120 vs 120), the queue to enter will only pop when there are at least 100 players on each side. Lately several queues have been 40 vs 120 for the first 8 minutes. When the remaining 80 players join, the fight has already been unfairly decided.

1b) Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa‚Äôs Rest acquisition rate needs to be hastened. For the same reason Valanyr and Shadowmourne are faster and easier to get, Dragonwrath needs to be more accessible.

1c) Molten Front Dailies, specifically to reach ‚ÄúFilling the Moonwell‚Äù needs to be shortened, simply because the timeline of Firelands will be hastened.

1d) Remove the 4.06 Nerfs to Heroic Dungeons ‚Äì Modern players are better and should deal with Heroic Dungeon Mechanics.

1e) Remove the guild perk ‚ÄúCash Flow.‚Äù The perk simply generates too much gold.

1f) Retail Auction House UI ‚Äì The modern AH UI is just so much better. There‚Äôs no negative to upgrading the AH UI in Classic.

Part 2: Changes most can agree to:

2a) Continue to make Alpha/Beta dungeons, or even better Mythic+ dungeons. I believe most players really enjoyed the Alpha/Beta/Gamma dungeons of WOTLK, so please keep this going. Mythic+ dungeons is one of the best parts of Retail WoW, so that would be welcome as well. If we get Mythic+ dungeons, the weekly chest rewards should only drop random ring, neck, bracer, boots, or belt.

2b) Reinstate the 3.2 to 3.3 WOTLK versions of LFG ALONG SIDE of RDF. Players like RDF, but they hate the new UI for making a group for anything else. Alternatively, give us the Retail WoW UI for LFG.

2c) Several Archeology Changes:

* Remove the cap of 200 fragments. Having the cap simply increases the grind time of Archeology.
* 5 Dig sites available at any given time and at least 1 always active in Tol‚Äôvir. Not having an active dig site in a Cata region at any given time simply sucks.
* All Solves increases Archeology Skill by 10 - 15 instead of 5
* Keystone Fragments tradeable and to play a much stronger roll in Mythic+ or Alpha/Beta Dungeons. This creates a reason for people to keep doing Archeology at max level even after they have all the BOA‚Äôs.

2d) An option to have Retail UI (not mandatory) ‚Äì The Retail UI is a lot cleaner and better. Please allow players to check a box in Classic to be able to turn on Retail UI.

2e) Increase the speed to level fishing. Maybe 5 skill points per cast.

2f) Make Epic Gems more accessible ‚Äì In WOTLK a player can transmute epic gems, prospect titanium ore, or use badges and honor to buy epic gems. In Cata, players randomly got an epic gem off Dragonsoul Bosses if lucky. Having to ration your epic gems feels bad. Keep the WOTLK and add a new transmute for epic gems. Make a chance for Pyrite Ore to prospect into epic gems, and allow players to buy them with Justice/Honor.

2g) Skip Void Storage. Go directly into the MoP system where you have an heirloom tab of all the equipment you‚Äôve had before for Transmog purposes.

Part 3: Controversial changes I will argue for:

3a) Nerf H Spine of Deathwing to the ground. Spine of Deathwing was a fight that broke up several guilds. The DPS requirements of bursting down each section was so high that raids had to stack Arcane Mages and Rogues with Legendaries. This lead to a lot of higher end guilds poaching players from other guilds. Many, many guilds broke apart after spending Firelands setting up their mages with Legendaries just to see these mages leave for another guild. Many loyal players of the high end guild were upset to be benched just so the guild can bring in an Arcane Mage with a legendary. This single fight caused the collapse of many social bonds in WoW. The worse part is, the fight is not even one that is considered fun or enjoyable.

3b) Nerf H Rag 25 some. This fight was also a ‚Äúguild killer.‚Äù I would argue that many players on Retail no longer enjoy Mythic Raiding because it‚Äôs just too hard and unforgiving. H Rag 25 is near that level. Killing a guild in a MMO is simply bad business. I remember two main nerfs to Rag. The first one came midway that reduced the health during P1 (the boring phase). The second nerf came right before Dragon Soul and was a major nerf. I believe H Rag 25 should follow this time schedule:

Week 1-2 ‚Äì Original Hardest Difficulty

Week 3-4 ‚Äì Phase 1 Nerf

Week 5 and beyond ‚Äì Dragon Soul prepatch nerf.

This way the HC guilds still get to fight it on the hardest difficulty, and the semi-HC guilds will get to H-Rag right around the time of the nerf. I think this is akin to the Kael/Vashj nerf, which is better than the Ulduar system which never got nerfed.

3c) Nerf Halfus 10H a little. This fight was simply unfairly hard on 10HC compared to 25HC. I recommend something simple like: nerf emerald whelps and storm rider drake‚Äôs health by 5% and damage by 10%.

3d) Nerf Nef 10H a little. Same reasoning as Halfus. I recommend something like Animated Bone Warriors do 10% less damage in P1.

3e) Timewalking Raids ‚Äì This is another amazing thing in Retail that I would love to see implemented into Classic. Honestly Timewalking Raids instead of LFR would just be amazing.

3f) Cross Faction/Cross Server Raiding ‚Äì There‚Äôs simply just so many players that say they‚Äôre quiting after WOTLK that I think allowing all players in a region (NA or EU or Asia) to play with each other would help maintain the population. A lonely and empty MMO is its own death spiral.

Part 4: My super special recommendation:

I used to think that all players were like me, only interested in the end game. However, Classic HC has clearly proven me wrong. The leveling experience in Cata was great for a player like me. With heirlooms, I was walking around 2 shotting mobs like a god, never in danger of death. However, another subsection of players enjoy a challenge while leveling. The biggest tragedy of Cata was that so much work was put into redoing Azeroth, and most people barely got to see it because leveling was so fast and easy.

Enter: CHAMPION MODE. Champion Mode must be turned on prior to level 5 and cannot be turned off. While on Champion Mode:

* All EXP gain is decreased by 66%
* Players cannot gain bonus exp from Heirlooms, JJ, Rested, or BG weekends.
* Players do 60% less damage against all mobs. Players take 50% extra damage from all mobs.
* Players cannot group with others who do not have Champion Mode on.
* Upon reaching level 80 with Champion Mode players receive the title ‚Äúof the Shattered World‚Äù and a Black and Red (similar to Deathwing‚Äôs colors) racial mount.
* Leveling 80-85 would be back to normal.

This mode would probably entice enough people to actually do all the new quests in the shattered Azeroth, and they would probably be enticed to do it several times for each racial mount."

My Take on Humans and Elves and Titan lineage,warcraftlore,16ifa25,2023-09-14 06:55:07,0,0.44,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/16ifa25/my_take_on_humans_and_elves_and_titan_lineage/,Lore-Archivist,Discussion,"To be clear, this is just my opinion, although I will attempt to back it up with logic and what evidence there is. 

Now on this forum and other places, I've often read about humans and their titan lineage, and how this allegedly gives them an affinity for arcane magic among other things. But I would argue Elves of all kinds have a closer connection to the Titans, or at least one of the Titans, than humanity does, despite not having originally been created by the Titans. 

Humans are so far removed from the original Titan product as to be entirely unrecognizable, originally they were metal skinned Vrykul, but after being cursed by the old gods, they have lost the metal skin and shrunk considerably, the most recent influence on them comes from the old gods, not the Titans, and it has altered them utterly. 

Conversely, Elves started off as trolls, native inhabitants of Azeroth, as far as we know, and were altered into Elves by the energies of the Well of Eternity, the very blood of Azeroth her self, a Titan. In the case of the night elves this is their most recent alteration, affected by a Titan, while for humans the most recent alteration is, as stated before, of the old gods. 

Some of the offshoots of the Elves, like Nightborne and High/Blood Elves, have further Titan influence,  Nightborne being infused with energy from Aman'Thul from the Eye of Aman'Thul, which altered them further, while High/Blood Elves were infused with the Sunwell, which being created by a vial of water from the well of eternity, is essentially a mini well of eternity, so they were just altered further by Azeroths blood. 

Elves could metaphorically claim to be Azeroths children, as they are presumably being made into her image, as I theorize any alterations in their race caused by Azeroths blood would presumably cause them to resemble her. (No proof of this, but it happens with other kinds of magic, old god corruption causes you to resemble the old gods, life ""corruption"" causes you to resemble other creatures closely affiliated with life/nature.)

Furthermore, humanity may further degenerate, as the curse of flesh has been referred to by several  sources as ""degenerative"" which would imply humans, and also dwarves and gnomes, may be stuck on a genetic predisposition toward further old god corruption. Conversely night elves still heavily expose them selves to moonwells, which are well of eternity water, ergo Azeroth blood, they are presumably still transforming more into a Titan affiliated form. 

Nightborne have lost the nightwell, so its unclear if they will be altered further, while Blood Elves have the Sunwell again, which may have a Naaru heart in it now making it a source of light energy, but its still also a source of arcane energy, and well of eternity water is regenerative, so presumably its still infusing them with Azeroth blood, although heavily diluted and light tinged. 

To Summarize, humanities most recent alteration to its species is from the old gods, while Elves most recent alterations to their species come from the Titans, or at least exposure to Titan energies/blood. One could argue the connection to the Titans is stronger in Elves and thus they have the stronger affinity for Arcane Magic than humans do.

A regrettably missed opportunity,warcraftlore,16fj028,2023-09-10 22:07:27,10,0.71,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/16fj028/a_regrettably_missed_opportunity/,Lore-Archivist,Discussion,"So I was playing WC3 frozen throne again and I ran across the night elf missions where they work with the blood elves near dalaran to stop illidan from casting his spell to destroy icecrown, and I realized, if the night elves made a base, which the game shows, they must have made moonwells.

Now, Kael'thas when he met malfurion and tyrande, seemed to be on friendly terms with them, they didn't seem to dislike him over his highborne heritage, and surely kael'thas must have noticed when standing near the moonwells the arcane addiction he was suffering from was sated.

So I'm thinking, if he would have said, ""hey, we'll help you stop illidan, but my people are suffering from magic withdrawal, your moonwells could stop it, once we stop illidan could you send some people to Quel'Thalas and build us some moonwells? You say They will also help heal our land?"" 

Now I understand malfurion would probably be a little skeptical, but tyrande would be compassionate enough to hear out the proposal and consider it.

With these moonwells sating their magic addiction and healing their land from the scourge taint, the blood elves would have been forever indebted to the night elves and both could have been in the alliance. 

The stuff with garithos would probably still happen but the night elves could warn the blood elves to not mess with the naga since they are bad news, and kael wouldn't follow illidan to outland if the magic addiction problem is solved. Later on the night elves could vouch to get the blood elves back into the alliance if they get their act together, which they might since kael would be back and no ones suffering from withdrawal so they don't need to use fel magic.

Only down side is the blood elves wouldn't be able to travel far from the moonwells without suffering the addiction again, but still for most civilians in silvermoon who don't leave the city often, a couple moonwells inside the city would go a long way, the moonwells also allegedly refill them selves somehow so taking water from them is an option

For Tyrande's part, she could see this as an opportunity to get the blood elves back into worshipping Elune. I doubt they would, but still I think she'd go for it."

Ok...but then the night elves took water from said well of eternity that illidan created, made moonwells with them and made these moonwells part of their religion. And by all accounts these moonwells have been useful and positive for the world, healing the land and people, but Illidan remained imprisoned, wtf? 

If remaking the well of eternity was such a great crime, why are its waters considered holy when put in a moonwell?

Evmos Project Spotlight - Deep Dive into Tashi Money Market,EVMOS,14ps3l3,2023-07-03 15:18:03,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EVMOS/comments/14ps3l3/evmos_project_spotlight_deep_dive_into_tashi/,tlopplot-,Educational,"[https://medium.com/evmos/evmos-project-spotlight-001-a-deep-dive-into-tashi-ee2f38f00b8e](https://medium.com/evmos/evmos-project-spotlight-001-a-deep-dive-into-tashi-ee2f38f00b8e)

# 

# What is Tashi?

Tashi is a transformative money market allowing individuals to participate in pooled lending and borrowing assets. Using Tashi, individuals can supply their assets, earn yields on their contributions, and choose to borrow against their assets in an overcollateralized manner.

As Tashi operates autonomously through smart contracts, the protocol ensures transparency and enhanced reliability due to the battle-tested nature of the application and its smart contracts.

# The Core Team and the Journey to Tashi

A team of industry experts lead Tashi with diverse backgrounds and expertise. Co-founder and CFO of Tashi, Lindsay Ironside, has a diverse background in chemical engineering, gold mining, and prospecting with Discovery Channel. Most recently, she participated in developing Rome Terminal within Rome Blockchain Labs. Her exceptional organizational skills and leadership qualities have aided Tashi‚Äôs growth and success.

Another key team member, co-founder Kristine Boulton, heads Business Development and Relationships. With a strong background as a trader in the DeFi space, Kristine brings a deep understanding of user experience, driving Tashi‚Äôs commitment to innovation and user-friendly solutions.

The inception of Tashi resulted from the team‚Äôs prior involvement with Rome Blockchain Labs (RBL) and their experience with successful projects like Benqi and Moonwell. They quickly saw the opportunity to leverage their skills and experience to bootstrap liquidity onto Evmos. The team is dedicated to creating a protocol that aligns with Evmos, enabling both the Evmos and Cosmos communities to reap the benefits.

By combining their existing network, novel ideas, and expertise, the Tashi team aims to build a protocol that caters specifically to the needs of the Evmos community.

Let‚Äôs go through some of the reasons why Tashi chose to build on Evmos ‚Äî and how Evmos uniquely empowers their protocol.

# The Advantages and Excitement of Evmos

As strong advocates of the Cosmos ecosystem, the team was initially captivated by the Evmos EVM compatibility, its proven reliability, and its impressive track record of scalability and composability. These factors played a significant role in Tashi‚Äôs decision to build on Evmos. Co-Founder Kristine further elaborates:

* *The well-tested nature of the EVM implementation and the strong community has played a significant role in our decision to choose Evmos. Additionally, the Evmos core team has shown incredible consistency and perseverance in building unique DeFi technology.*

The Tashi team firmly believes that the EVM is the most robust and extensively tested developer framework for protocols like Tashi. Therefore, selecting Evmos, the first EVM-compatible network within the Cosmos ecosystem, was a natural decision. Additionally, the Tashi team‚Äôs deep understanding of Solidity and their experience launching multiple protocols in that language further solidified Evmos as the ideal choice for their project.

The Cosmos ecosystem, particularly the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, opens up exciting liquidity and capital efficiency possibilities. This makes Cosmos a distinctive network, with Evmos serving as the gateway to the EVM. Tashi envisions expanding its reach to other chains while consolidating liquidity within Evmos.

# Tashi Tokenomics & Technical Architecture

Tashi‚Äôs technical architecture relies on[ smart contracts](https://tashi-1.gitbook.io/tashi-1/resources/contracts) and user interface displays to operate the lending protocol. Due to this, the core processes of the protocol are fully transparent and on-chain, ensuring maximum security and integrity.

With the front-end interface built privately for Evmos, extensive UX research has gone into its development, making it user-friendly and tailored to the specific needs of Tashi‚Äôs economic and tokenomic structure. The Evmos EVM compatibility is also vital in Tashi‚Äôs architecture. The Evmos EVM enables Tashi to benefit from composability, added security, and battle-tested smart contract standards.

Tashi utilizes an innovative interest rate pricing model to enhance capital efficiency and yield for lenders. With a bold and pioneering approach, Tashi aims to establish a new standard by rewarding long-term holders through its tokenomics strategy. To understand the TASHI token supply, let‚Äôs break it down. The total supply of TASHI is 720 million, distributed as follows:

The token allocations serve specific purposes within the Tashi ecosystem. For instance:

* **Liquidity Incentives:** 20% is designated for lenders and borrowers on Tashi over a span of 3‚Äì4 years.
* **Core Contributors:** 18% is awarded to Tashi‚Äôs main contributors over a 30-month vesting period.
* **Initial DEX Liquidity:** 15% is allocated to liquidity pools upon launch.
* **Public Sale:** 10% is distributed to participants as a combination of Tashi and xTashi tokens.
* **Partnerships:** 8% is set aside for supporting long-term partners.
* **Liquidity Reserves:** 8% is reserved for future liquidity requirements.

Starting with Tashi‚Äôs Genesis Pools on June 15th, users are incentivized to deposit EVMOS and ATOM with up to 2.5% of Tashi‚Äôs token supply. Following the public token sale, the pools will allow withdrawals alongside the full protocol launch, with the genesis yield shared pro rata among remaining depositors. Depositors can continue staking in the pool until September 14th.

Furthermore, Tashi reserves 7.5% for unexpected future needs, 4% for project runway and contractor payments, 3.5% for grants and programs supporting the Tashi ecosystem, 2.5% for genesis lenders paid in esTASHI over three months, and 2.5% for project advisors over a 30-month vesting period. Additionally, 1% is allocated to bug discovery and resolution. The tokenomics were designed in cooperation with Rome Blockchain Labs.

Tashi‚Äôs Token Sale is scheduled for July 24th, with 10% of the TASHI supply available. The valuation will be announced before the sale, and buyers will receive xTASHI tokens upon completion. At least 5% of the sale‚Äôs proceeds will contribute to the Rewards Fund, providing a base yield for xTASHI stakers in the first year.

The EVMOS token is also integral in the Tashi architecture. It is included in Tashi‚Äôs Genesis Pools, making it one of the first assets listed for deposits, collateralization, and borrowing on the platform. Tashi‚Äôs platform will later support the Liquid Staking solution developed by Rome Blockchain Labs for the EVMOS token and its sEVMOS counterpart. This integration benefits EVMOS token holders and contributes to the network‚Äôs overall security and validity.

# Building Process and Challenges

The building process on Evmos has been remarkably smooth for Tashi, thanks to their familiarity with the coding language and the strong support provided by the Evmos team. While there were a few points of friction, as is common in new ecosystems, Tashi‚Äôs experience in similar environments mitigated any challenges they encountered. The Evmos team‚Äôs assistance and the dedication of their technical team were instrumental in overcoming hurdles related to validator operation, asset transfers, and establishing partnerships with key vendors in the ecosystem.

# Interoperability and the Future Vision for Tashi

Tashi will leverage interoperability tooling, such as EVM Extensions provided by Evmos, to aggregate liquidity from various chains into Evmos, creating a robust and dynamic ecosystem for its users. Like many others, Tashi eagerly anticipates the potential tokenomics upgrade for the EVMOS token. They recognize the Evmos team‚Äôs in-depth understanding of what works and what doesn‚Äôt and believe such opportunities are pivotal for platforms to incorporate valuable learnings.

Tashi‚Äôs future partnerships and integrations with projects like Wormhole and Pyth will contribute to liquidity and growth while attracting a broader range of participants to the Evmos ecosystem. They are also committed to nurturing a strong and engaged community. Some other exciting future plans include the continued amplification of Genesis Pools, a community sale, full protocol deployment, risk dashboard deployment, CEX asset rails into Evmos, and the implementation of liquid staking.

Additionally, Tashi envisions introducing isolated pools for enhanced security, undercollateralized lending, on-chain and off-chain credit, added decentralization, and other innovative features that adapt to changing market needs.

# Wrapping Up

Tashi is a unique, trailblazing project for Evmos and the entire Cosmos ecosystem. With a visionary team, a commitment to innovation, and a strong focus on community, Tashi is poised to become a foundational pillar of DeFi on Evmos."

We finally finished our campaign after 4.5 years. Together.,DungeonsAndDragons,1462y39,2023-06-10 11:21:38,41,0.92,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/1462y39/we_finally_finished_our_campaign_after_45_years/,Fall-of-Enosis,OC,"Just wanted to share this with ya'll as this was something that was very special to all of us.

Our campaign has been running pretty strong for the past 4.5 years, with us playing over Fantasy Grounds every other Saturday. The party consisted of myself Playing Rorik Ironfist, a one armed Dwarven Pugilist, Dibble Dabblestone, a Gnomish ADHD Artificer, Tharic, a half elven multiclass Servant of Mystra (mostly Pally/Cleric) and Fedhin, a warforged (robot more or less) wild magic Barb. The campaign started at level 1 and we ended at 20.

All of us players actually work at the same place and have known each other for many years. But our DM, (name changed for Privacy) Mark and I met first on Xbox nearly ten years ago through his brother when he randomly dragged him into a Crota's End Raid on Destiny. Both are Australian, but Mark lives on the East Coast as he is a professional actor. Spends most of his time in theater. But also has done some voice acting in games and a few smaller films.

Over the course of 4.5 years Mark weaved for us literally the best campaign I have ever played in DnD. It was 100% homebrew with the most vibrant cast of NPC's ever, spanning over most of the Moonshae Isles where it took place. We started out on a lowly fishing ship, barely knowing one another. We fought Goblins, saving the Moonwells, protected Kingdoms. We tavelled to the Fey Wilds asking for help on the side of the road, while a bunch of Fey ignored us. We made a quick enemy of an Arch Fey named ""Sadereal"" whom Dibbel immediately wrote a song about called ""Sadereal's a dick"". We ""befriended"" a Green Dragon. We were sucked into a bottle where we lived in a desert until we could escape. We found ourselves on a space faring ship, The Argent Traveler, making more friends of the crew along the way. We made close friends of William, the proprietor ""Williams Wonder Emporium"", who was always happy to invite us into his home/shop for a cup of tea and a chat about adventure. We generally over-payed Tanka, the kind and mostly reserved Firbolg owner and bartender of ""The Ivy Rose"", where we would always sit upstairs and drink in our booth to chat about our next steps. This is where Dibble also found a flyer an upcoming Dinosaur carnival. The entire city showed up to watch the dinosaur ships dock, but all hell broke loose when we found that they were out of their pens with all the crew massacred. We had to track down a bunch of Dinosaurs running amok! This is when Rorik succesfully grappled a T-Rex! (well TBH he grappled a TON of things). Rorik found out about his Long lost family (he was Born in Waterdeep, a beggar, thinking he was tossed out due to his misshapen arm) the Lightrocks. We travelled to White Rock, the largest Dwarven settlement only to find that most of my clan was lost, but a good amount were still holding on. We took back the mines from an evil Beholder named Xualaxisk, who was the one that bit off Rorik's arm as a child. Rorik plunged his fist into the eye and had William fashion a new Ironfist out of it. Dibbel grew close to another smart Gnome named Layla and she helped him make new special ammunition for his rifle ""Duchess"".

But some evil was set to take over the entire Moonshaes as well as Toril. All this crazyness was coming to a head and we had to stop it. ""The Onyx Empress"" was behind all of this. All of our friends we made along the way were rallying together, and we found a relic that would allow us to meet the Onyx Empress in a pocket plane. 

But months before all this happened, Mark told us that we wouldn't finish the campaign.

At least not over Fantasy Grounds.

He told us that for the last session he wanted to fly out from the East Coast so we could finish the campaign. Together. In the same room. 

This was obviously amazing. Not only would I get to meet a good friend whom I had never met in real life, but we would be together when we finshed this story that was so important to all of us. We had a few months to prepare while we contiued to play over FG. We rented an AirBNB on Oregon Coast. Planned Food. We all ordered custom Minis from Hero Forge, as Mark was already painting Minis and creating terrain for the final battle/session.

We knew that we wanted to do something special for Mark. Get him a gift. Something to remember this wonderful journey he took us on. We eventually settled on a party portrait. I contacted MANY artists on Reddit and eventually settled on u/Weeeizard aka Isabell. I asked her to create a drawing of all of our characters, together in the Ivy Rose, but with one extra person there. Mark. Retelling us his stories. Isabell was awesome throughout the entire process. Professional, on time, and never complained if I needed changes done to the characters. She understood how important all of this was to us.  
We spent four wonderful days together at a rented house on the Oregon coast being nerds. One of which was a 7 hour session where we faced off against our BBEG, The Onyx Empress, with wonderful terrain and gorgeous minis hand painted by the DM we cherish so much.   
We barely survived only to have the BBEG implode sucking Tharic (the guy toying with the silver flame) in immediately killing him, but sending him back into the hands of his God, Mystra. This is a GOOD death for Tharic. He only ever wanted serve his mistress and was happy to do so to bring balance to Toril. Dibbel was saved barely as he was out of the AOE.  
The rest of us survived and ended the campaign going our separate ways. Dibbel (the gnome) and Phedin (the warforged) are returning to Caer Callidyrr (the main city in the Moonshae Isles) to help rebuild the city after the destruction the BBEG had brought.  
Rorik (my character, the tattooed Dwarf) is returning to his clan and family, that he only recently realized were still alive. There is a teleportation circle available so he can go and visit his friends in Caer Callidyrr when he needs. 

We presented the art to Mark after the last session and he LOVED it. We all teared up a bit together with him and embraced. He was so greatful for the memories that had now been immotalized. 

We finished the weekend, by chilling on the beach, playing a bunch of board games, probably drinking too much and also watching the DnD movie together.

Thanks for reading my wall of text. This was so special for us, and I hope you all have a wonderful campaign/DM out there for yourselves! It's so nice to be able to share the game we love so much with one another.

Also many thanks to u/SterlingVermin for the Pugilist. Rorik was a blast to play and will probably be one of my favourite characters ever. Although me and my DM had to nerf the class a bit in the later levels. 

TLDR: We played a 1-20 homebrew campaign over 4.5 years on FG with a DM I had known for a decade but never met. He flew in for the final session so we could play together in the same room. We commissioned some dope art that he loves. It was a wonderful weekend for us and we're starting a new campaign soon!"

The Hungry Moon: A review,horrorlit,13mi21c,2023-05-20 00:39:28,13,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/13mi21c/the_hungry_moon_a_review/,JexPickles,Review,"The question of ""What's a good cosmic horror novel that isn't Lovecraft?"" comes up a lot on this subreddit, and by a lot I mean more often than Nick Cutter writes animal abuse passages! 

I'd love to say I'm kidding, but Nick writes a *lot* of animal abuse... but let's put that aside for another thread.  I want to tell you about this book, holy SHIT this book.  

I'll do my best not to spoil anything, no promises.  Here's what you need to know, in summary before I get into the meat of things:  An old English town grapples with the hubris of man, religious zealotry and an ancient evil that Should Not Be  that is older than the universe itself.  

Now; to the too long bit: 

What makes this book an excellent example of Horror is that it generates a never ending, deeply uncomfortable, and very personal sense of dread that ramps up until the very end.  

The slow insidious infiltration of Moonwell by evangelical Christians resonated with me, Campbell captures the feeling of alienation and persecution that one feels if one were...say... the only non-catholic child in a catholic school.  The feeling of everyone *looking down on you* because you didn't worship the way they did, or if you point out that they're acting kind of ridiculous, or if they kept trying to shove their idolatry down your throat at every opportunity, expressed BEAUTIFULLY in this work, the sheer discomfort had me squirming in my seat more than any shockpunk or splatterpunk or whatever the jump-scare writers are calling themselves now... 

hacks? Hacks.  We'll go with that. 

Watching the town slowly turn on each other was masterfully done, but, I believe I promised you an ancient evil?  Oh yes, my little freaky people, there is.  There *so* is.  Things go very wrong in short order and they go wrong in all the right ways.  

I loved this book, I almost feel ashamed to mention that I nearly didn't get into it because of the rapid-fire introduction of all the characters in the initial part of the book, but it paid off quite quite well. 

It's rare that a book can affect me so much, touch on the old scars deep inside and poke them enough that they ache, and when I find one like this, I'll treasure it forever.  

Thank you, Mr. Campbell, you've deeply disturbed me."
How I just used a DeFi protocol to leverage stable coins for 52% yield.,CryptoCurrency,12c7axi,2023-04-04 23:44:58,7,0.59,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12c7axi/how_i_just_used_a_defi_protocol_to_leverage/,Justin534,STRATEGY,"First I should point out a few things

* This is not risk free
* That yield is subject to change based on supply and demand for borrowing stablecoins in the protocol
* The yield in terms of the FRAX stable coin is 34% The other 18% is paid in a combination of Moonbeam's token (GLMR) and the protocol's token (WELL). This could have the effect of higher or lower actual yields than 52% depending on how those tokens trade in the future.

Ok now that those bullet points are out of the way I'll get to it. I was looking at different protocols trying to figure out how to get some good yield. I could put tokens into similar liquidty pools, for example stETH-ETH or USDC-USDT-BUSD, etc. There's traditional coin staking options. But I've yet to have a go with borrowing and lending protocols yet, and after looking a bit at DeFi llama and [Beefy.finance](https://Beefy.finance) I saw what seems like a good opportunity to dip my toes into a borrowing protocol.

The protocol I used here is Moonwell Artemis on Moonbeam. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain.

First order of business was to get my FRAX tokens over from Arbitrum to Moonbeam. I used [StellaSwap](https://app.stellaswap.com/exchange/cross-chain-swap) for this as it supports cross chain swaps from Arbitrum.

Now on [Moonwell Artemis](https://moonwell.fi/artemis/FRAX) I deposit my FRAX. Specifically $108 FRAX

[Depositing $108 FRAX on Moonwell Artemis](https://preview.redd.it/u4aoa306hzra1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=97a75fbc9a8c36cf4989b5e8f42e5ecf9982761e)

Now I'm getting the supply yield, and can borrow USDC for less than my supply yield.

Next step was to borrow 55 USDC from my $108 FRAX collateral.

[Borrowing 55 USDC](https://preview.redd.it/1kk8qebshzra1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d7315f6911e2322b42dfb4f4676e5367080e158)

I didn't borrow the full amount so that way I have a little wiggle room should USDC move above peg or FRAX depegs. Though any serious depeg or failure of FRAX would lead to my collateral being liquidated. Of course since my collateral is itself FRAX, and if FRAX failed then I'm not so sure I would be losing much more than if I just by held FRAX.

Next step was to head back over to StellaSwap and swap my USDC back for FRAX.

&#x200B;

[Swap Back to FRAX](https://preview.redd.it/6xqqb02eizra1.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=6914b8da4fea3186e515435c532dedb090770cd0)

Now I resupply that FRAX back for the supply yield.

&#x200B;

[Ressuply FRAX](https://preview.redd.it/2hqveajwizra1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9ef2f9161046c4ee289114b2342706647b6397e)

I repeated this process several times borrowing USDC, swapping back for FRAX, and resupplying until I'm at where my current position is  $226.57 FRAX supplied and borrowing $117.05 USDC.

&#x200B;

[Supply and Borrow](https://preview.redd.it/4dm9dcfhjzra1.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&s=a59d0b2d365d8741be733c4200dfc900cba4b45f)

Here is the current supply rate on FRAX and borrow rate on USDC.

&#x200B;

[FRAX Supply APY](https://preview.redd.it/xpnns0nxjzra1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2f64818c323f45c880db9be032516a5ce193e01)

&#x200B;

[USDC Borrow Rate](https://preview.redd.it/0fp8lre1kzra1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1e7f41fd405921f495fc861f9b43868ea9ce576)

So now we can calculate my APY on an investment of $108.

I'm supplying $226.57 at 27.32% APY. So after one year that's a yield of $61.90. I'm also borrowing $117.05 at a rate of 4.91%. So after 1 year I will owe $5.75. I now subtract that from by supply yield to get my net yield which is $56.15.

The final step is now to calculate the net APY from my $108 principal. So I take $56.15 and divide by $108 to see I'm getting a net APY of 52%

Voila!

Like I said though this carries more risk than just supplying. Plus there's also smart contract risk and any risk's associated with using Moonbeam.

Also the APY will fluctuate. If you look closely at some of the pictures above you'll notice the supply APY for FRAX is different than the ones I'm using in the calculation. When I deposited about a week ago the supply APY was lower but I was still getting about 30-35% net APY. It is entirely possible, though, that supply and demand for stable coins in this protocol will make this trade much less interesting or I could even be paying more to borrow than to supply. But at least for now I'm getting a pretty meaty yield on my FRAX with limited additional risk."

RazerMoon's balance suggestions,WC3,zmfueh,2022-12-15 03:10:16,20,0.72,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/WC3/comments/zmfueh/razermoons_balance_suggestions/,Razer_Moon,," 

Dear Blizzard,

Firstly, I would like to thank you for your efforts and hardwork that you put into our favorite old game. Some of your suggestions are just great, but others might literally crash the game. Dear Blizzard, please, consider taking my thoughts and notes on the balance patch. My nickname is RazerMoon and I am one of the best players in both  - North and South America. (Probably top-2 usa player after Hitman).

Please, be so kind as to review my notes and thanks again for the time you put into actually helping our small community and finally making a balance patch. 

Hopefully, you would understand my unwillingness to comply with some caster‚Äôs opinion because I believe it might have a strong influence on the pro-scene of WC3. In the end, I want all 4 races to be balanced and everyone to be happy. 

Some people suggest nerfing the bears to 920 hp. DO NOT DO THAT. That along with ghoul and grunt buffing, moving ultravision, nerfing keeper will actually break the night elf race.

Now let's go to the actual changes. 

\*\*Human\*\*

\* Blacksmith lumber cost reduced from 60 to 50. -

That is a good change. Maybe it‚Äôs going to bring more balance for the ‚Äúrifle push‚Äù against orcs/nelfs. However, nelf-hum match up in the current state on top level has a statistics of 52.% favoring night elf. Therefore, I think it is a good change..

.\* Peasant HP increased from 230 to 240.

\- This change is questionable because it is meant to help hum-ud match up, however, there's a problem with ne-hum match up now. Warden would need 2 hits with orb + fan lvl 3 in order to lame human peasants (a necessary gameplay for elf to compete vs human in the top scene). There could be indirect nerfs to the warden play during the anti-magic duration on the peasants. Therefore, a warden buff fan additional +10 dmg to level3 fan of knives would be needed to rebalance the hu-nelf MU if this update is to take place.

.\* Control Magic moved from T2 to T3.

This change might actually break one of the hu-orc strategies for human. Now human cannot proceed playing spell breakers and would instead be forced into playing 4 priests instead. It's hard to say if that's a positive change at all. It needs way more testing and speaking to the actual pro-players for implementation. So let's test it for now, but later it might be needed to be reversed. Considering hu-orc match-up being at 44.1% win rate at grandmaster level of W3C, this is actually an unwanted change.  

\* Siphon mana cost increased from 10 to 20 mana.

This change is rather positive because 10 mana is basically no mana, this way it might bring some mindful use of that ability.

\* Siphon Mana Drain rate reduced from 15/30/45 to 15/25/40.

Since level 1 ability has never been fixed, this would be more or less the same ability. Questionable, but I think it‚Äôs a step in the right direction. 

\* Holy Light cooldown reduced from 5 to 4 seconds.

This change can be extremely dangerous. Holy light is 65 mana, which is not changed for 75, unlike warden‚Äôs shadow strike or dk‚Äôs coil. Therefore, this might bring a whole new strategy for laming undead players. Paladin becomes a counter-pick for lich and ud‚Äôs fast expo. I think along with changing the CD of the ability, it needs the increase the actual use cost to 75 mana. However, on the reverse side of things, pala is hard-countered by crypt lord on the undead‚Äôs side of things. So tests would be necessary to determine. 

\* Polymorph cost reduced from 220 mana to 200 mana. 

It would not make any significant difference, so I think this change is unnecessary. 

\* Mechanical Critter sight ranged increased from 350 to 500.

This is another unnecessary change. I highly doubt this does anything to the actual gameplay. 

\* Siege Engine now has heavy armor.

This one is actually a terrible change. Heavy armor tanks are useless vs undead and night elf players. 3 archers can kill a tank now. Even though I‚Äôm a nelf player, I don‚Äôt want humans to be underpowered. I want the game to be balanced and therefore tanks need to be REWORKED. They would need to have fortified armor. 

\* Siege Engine can now attack units.

The whole concept or idea is actually cool, however the implementation is terrible. It might be better if they have 2 different attacks, one for buildings, another one for units. This would be somewhat balanced. 

\* Siege Engine base damage reduced from 44 to 22.

Unnecessary change. It rather needs to have 2 different attack types, one for buildings, another for units. 

\* Siege Engine barrage damage increased from 14 to 16.

Okay, makes the unit better against mass air style. 

\* Mass Teleport Cooldown increased from 20 to 30 seconds.

Needs testing, generally I think this is a positive change. 

\* Mortar Team HP increased from 360 to 380.

A good one. 

\* Siege Engine no longer decreases in unit level when getting the barrage upgrade.

Fixed the bug from the previous patch. Good one. 

\*\*Orc\*\*

\* Headhunters cost increased from 140 to 160 and lumber cost increased from 20 to 30.

That‚Äôs a positive change because orc-hu MU is broken. This might help human players to actually be able to determine the winner of a game by skill rather than ultra-imba HH. 

\* Blademaster Mirror images now do 10% of the Blademaster‚Äôs base damage.

\~ Questionable. I think it is completely unnecessary considering other night elf changes. I think this change needs to be removed. 

\* Endurance Aura movement speed bonus reduced from 0.1/0.2/0.3 to 0.1/0.15/0.2.

A positive change considering grandmaster level late games where human or nelf cannot compete with Tauren Chieftain‚Äôs move speed and excessive base laming.

\* Witch Doctor Healing Wards increased from 5 to 10 HP.

This change needs to be reversed because it only affects the amount of mana a destroyer would get from dispelling a healing ward. Only favors undead players. 

\* Stasis Trap activation delay reduced from 9 to 7 seconds.

I personally don‚Äôt think this is a necessary change as well. Better not to make any changes. 

\* Brute Strength bonus increased from 100 to 150 HP. 

This one might go heavy on night elf players including the ghoul buffs and the keeper nerf. I think you need to actually buff keeper or leave it as it is in order to implement this change. It would also go heavy on human players. This is another example of a terrible balance change that might make the game one-sided. 

\*\*Night Elf\*\*

\* Tranquility cooldown increased from 60 seconds to 120 seconds.

That‚Äôs definitely a positive change. First of all, 60 seconds seems to be literally imbalanced. I truly think that the keeper‚Äôs ultimate needed to be changed and now it‚Äôs balanced. Good job on this one. 

\* Starfall cooldown reduced from 180 seconds to 120 seconds.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that it is a positive change due to the ultravision removal the only match-up where potm could‚Äôve been played as a 1st hero and then likely to get lvl 6 ‚Äì nelf mirror. However, due to the ultravision nerf, this is not any useful. 

\* Starfall mana cost reduced from 200 to 150 mana.

Same as the previous one. 

\* Druid of the talon crow form now does piercing damage.

This is questionable. From one side, it brings new strategies and meta, which is always interesting to see. However, I am afraid this might be OP. Needs testing. 

\* Entangle duration on units reduced from 9/18/30 to 8/16/24.

This is a truly terrible change. Along with ghoul buff, grunt buff ‚Äì this one actually makes keeper less playable vs all the races, especially undeads. For example, lvl 3 keeper and lvl 2 entangle ability would‚Äôve required 3 to 4 hits on a footman for it to die. Now, it requires 5 to 6 hits, which makes the hero less playable and powerful vs human. Considering 2200 mmr + ne/hu winrate, which is 52% favoring night elf players, this might actually be big and I think needs to be reverted. Along with ghoul/grunt buff ‚Äì this is actually breaking nelf gameplay. Nelf statistics vs undead player on grandmaster level (W3C 2200+ mmr) is 46.9%. By nerfing keeper we might crash it into 40%, which is FAR AWAY from being balanced. 

\* Thorn Aura increased from 0.1/0.2/0.3 to 0.15/0.30/0.45.

This is a positive change because it would be an equivalent of dread lord‚Äôs vampiric aura for the air ne-ud fighting. This is actually a positive and balanced change that might bring the winrate to 50% on pro scene.

\* Mountain Giants now start with +2 armor.

This one needs to be reverted due to the nerf which is the next fix:

\* Harden Skin damage reduction reduced from 12 to 8.

A terrible idea to do, MG‚Äôs gameplay and overall still make them less powerful T2 and now they become not that useful on t3.

\* Ultravision now requires tier 2.

This is the MOST questionable out of all. It actually breaks potm-hunts/keeper-hunts t1 play. It is ‚Äúintendant‚Äù to fix orc-nelf balance. However, this match-up current state is 53.5% favoring nelf players. That 3.5% difference might be in just hp buff for grunts. However, it might be needed vs undeads with kotg-mass hunts strategy and push expo due to winrate of 46.9%. Therefore, I find it questionable. Either nerf undead or remove this change. 

\* Immolation mana drain reduced from 7 to 5.

This is the most interesting change. To begin with, I need to say that unless keeper is actually nerfed, we might not need this change. However, if you proceed to nerf the keeper (specifically entangle), we need a new meta hero, which might be a demon hunter. However, if you listen to remo‚Äôs suggestion to make immolation deal w/e he says like 7x2 per second, that immolation becomes absolute and complete garbage for the amount of mana it actually consumes, it used to be 7 mana per sec, now its 10 mana per sec but higher damage. Due to the moon well healing insufficiency, in remo‚Äôs suggestions this becomes unplayable. 

\* Immolation Damage per Interval increased from 10/15/20 to 15/20/25.

This is something that needs a change, however, you need to change it exactly to 66% of what it does right now. In other words, it needs to be 10/15/20, including 0.5 perc time. If you actually nerf it to the ground, along with a keeper nerf, night elves would struggle against buffed ghouls/grunts. All three of those changes come together and we need to understand that an immolation DH is the DH that has either mana burn or evasion. Without evasion, it cannot tank the creeps, without mana burn ‚Äì it would take far more damage from nuking. Due to the nature of this ability and night elf‚Äôs gameplay around the moonwell mana juice, a middle ground for it would not be at 50% (as remo says), but rather at 66%. We want it to deal 20 dmg/sec, with 0.5 interval (10 dmg x 2 times per second). Otherwise, you need to cancel the keeper nerf (or even slightly buff its current entangling roots).

\* Immolation Duration reduced from 1 to 0.5 seconds.

This is a positive change for the new gameplay because otherwise that spell is useless at all levels, including level 8 DH. 

\*\*Undead\*\*

\* Anti-Magic Shield can now receive the same summon magic damage inflicted by dispel, purge, and abolish magic.

Firstly, this spell doesn‚Äôt work on the PTR as written down. Secondly, this would make human late game mass gryphon strategy OP vs undead players. This needs to be reworked. Maybe a different interpretation is needed. 

\* Unholy Aura movement speed bonus reduced from 0.1/0.175/0.25 to 0.1/0.15/0.2.

A positive change for the late game ud-ne, ud-hu dynamics. Also balances the orc-ud along with the TC‚Äôs endurance aura change.

\* Animated Dead corpses can now be killable and have diseased cloud if researched.

This ultimate for a long time has been useless. It could be potentially used only against warden‚Äôs ultimate so her avatar doesn‚Äôt summon more units. Basically, this update makes it even less useful. I think this needs to be reworked and rebalanced. It could be dispelled now, which makes it awful (btw you get xp for dispelling! :D)

\* Ghoul Frenzy now adds 30HP to ghouls‚Äô base health.

This is one of the things I disagree with MOST. If you nerf immolation as Remo suggests, along with current nerf of keeper, this might be really dangerous. UD-NE match up on high level heavily favors undead players. Especially fast expansion play. There are literally players, who made their careers putting on a fast expansion. Along with this ghoul buff, it is going to be nearly impossible to hold undead‚Äôs timing push for both night elf and human players. We want this change to be removed completely due to grandmaster winrate on 2 matchups:

Night Elf vs Undead 2200+ mmr (W3Champions stats) - 46.9%

Human vs Undead 2200+ mmr (W3Champions stats) - 44.7%

I see no point of making undeads even more broken. They are already TOUGH to play against. 

\* Disease cloud reduced from 90 to 75 seconds.

A positive change because this used to hurt human and nelfs most. 90 secs is way too long and imbalanced. 75 is more reasonable and maybe it even needs to be 60 secs instead. Needs testing, but so far so good. 

\* Obsidian Statue level increased from 2 to 3.

Obviously, this is a positive change, however, it doesn‚Äôt help the CORE problem of the ud-vs-everyone match up. This upgrade mostly is going to benefit orc players due to their ability to quickly kill statues with ensnare + damage. However, the core problem of the statue is its mana regen. Statue is a t2 unit that apparently is an absolute equivalent of archmage‚Äôs brilliance aura level 3. So, for 200 gold, you‚Äôre able to get brilliance aura level 3. It needs to be decreased (mana regen specifically) by 33% for balancing. 

On top of that, the main problem is LICH+Fast Expansion. It hurts both, human and night elf players. We need either the sacrificial skull or the nerubian tower nerfed. Either make the skull cost some lumber to buy, for example 40-50 wood. Or you have to nerf the nerubian tower‚Äôs slow. That would make it playable for nelf players, including harassing of undead‚Äôs expo. Human suffer less from nerubian tower, but lich‚Äôs nova is actually imbalanced due to no unit cap and mainly the slow effect the nova deals. Apparently, lvl 3 nova deals the MOST damage out of all permanent skills of the game. The problem is, undeads are able to literally melt bears, knights, etc. 

I would like to point out that some people are great casters, but also they are undead players, and therefore, their balance suggestions might be slightly incorrect. We need to ask all four races, and only high-level players. In my opinion, the balance really comes to play only on high-level play. Anyone before the grandmaster league could just improve by better game-understanding and so on. However, the balance really matters on the pro scene. Currently, we are having an undead patch. Some casters say that ‚Äúyet some top nelf players, like LawLiet and Moon and Kaho have NOT yet figured out how to beat undead players like 120 or LabyRinth‚Äù. But this balance has been in-game for 2 years and I hardly believe that apparently all the nelf players are stupid and uncreative and just ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù win undeads on the profesPleasesional scene. This topic could extend to human players as well. They need some changes to actually be able to compete. The winrate that could be called balanced is ONLY 50% overall, not when it is one-sided as if right now. Therefore, we want the game to be actually BALANCED, and not IMBALANCED towards EITHER side, including my own race, which is nelf. 

Please, take into consideration my voice and therefore a lot of night elf player‚Äôs voices. We literally rely on you and spend days and months playing our favorite game. We want it to be balanced. . "

Rewriting from the end of Legion,warcraftlore,wr8gma,2022-08-17 23:14:13,0,0.48,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/wr8gma/rewriting_from_the_end_of_legion/,jjoyz,Discussion,"Okay so this is the next part of how I would write, enjoy XD.

Patch 8.0

Warbringer Sylvanas( well atleast my version) takes place here chronologically. The overall cinematic is the same, but with few differences. It's not at Teldrassil, but at a random Alliance encampment, it's not Delaryn but a high elf who used to serve Sylvanas at Quel'Thalas, and instead of Teldrassil burning, it's revealed that Sylvanas is  blighting whatever encampments of Alliance she finds.

 Zul and Talanji are taken prisoner by the Alliance, with the reason being any troll regardless of tribe-kingdom are suspicious and may be enemies to the Alliance. Their rescue and subsequent journey to Zandalar happens the same.

 Jaina, feeling guilt over her presence at Teldrassil and what it meant, decides to absolve her guilt by bringing allies to the Alliance and make them the victors, which would mean Nelfs would have something for their losses, according to her. She goes to Kul'tiras.

 The 2 continent campaigns are largely the same. The differences show towards the end.
 On the Alliance side, Thros is the equivalent raid of Uldir. Jaina's questions now ends when players reach the Fate's end island, and find a magical message from her that responds only to either her mother, who accompany the player in the questline, Anduin, or the player. The message tells them that Jaina has entered the realm of Thros, and that she is fighting.
 Katherine asks for the players to rescue her, and the raid starts at the island's shores.

 Raid: Thros, the Blighted Lands, 8 bosses culminating in finding Jaina and aiding her against Gorak Thul. Throughout the raid, it is revealed that drust druids managed to slice the fabric of Thros open and create a rift, and the drust as a whole is planning to escape the realm through the rift. During the final boss fight, Gorak Zhar, partner of Gorak Thul, leads the remaining forces of drust through the rift, and the rift shuts down. At the end of the fight, Gorak Thul unleashes the full extent of his power and incapacitates Jaina, and is later slain by the raid. The raid ending cinematic is the realm of torment cinematic, with Jaina awakening on the ground instead of on a tree log. The rest of the Kul'tiras happens as before.

 On the Horde side, everything is pretty much the same, but the influence of N'zoth is more prevalent throughout Nazmir. The imprisoned Old God was trying to communicate with its artificial cousin, and aided it by sending Mythrax in ages past, but G'huun is not interested in communication, and is solely focused on spreading its rot and corruption. The raid happens as before, and the Zandalar campaign happens as before.

 Towards the end of the 8.0, Night Warrior questline happens. But this is different from before, and actually happens on the burnt boughs of Teldrassil, and amongst the ruins of Darnassus. The players don't fight the Horde during the questline, but the crazed harpies and satyrs, and helps Tyrande heal or put to rest the burnt ancients. The Eye of Elune is now not a necessary part of the ritual, but just an addition that can prevent the participants from dying by absorbing the energy if it reaches dangerous levels. Tyrande invokes the ritual on one of the moonwells, and the questline ends with her becoming the Night Warrior, and the dark moon rising on the entire northern part of Kalimdor. Then, it is mentioned that she is forming her Army of the Dark Moon, with Nelfs and worgens as members.

Warfronts begin, as well as 2 dungeons with 5-7 bosses each for the factions, titled, ""War Efforts"" that make the other war fronts (Ashenvale, Quel'Thalas) the dungeon setting, and the opposing faction figures such dark rangers and Horse generals/Army of Dark Moon fighters and Alliance generals as bosses. Each faction first defends their border and then invades the opponent during the latter few bosses of the dungeons.

 Patch 8.0: Draw, as both sides are merely preparing their forces.

 On the side, Magni begin recruiting players to gather azerite, as before, but this time, he is more desperate, like a parent asking for doctors on the streets for his dying child. He explain that azerite is the result of what happens when an Old God blood is exposed to titanic blood, and the void is burnt away with the raw arcane until the substance is all that remains. He reasons that gathering and converting azerite from liquid/solid substance to pure arcane energy through the Heart of Azeroth and returning them to the world soul at the Chamber of the Heart would help her regain strength, as the substance would be then pure arcane in nature, and Azeroth is a being of arcane.

Patch 8.1: Tides of Vengeance

 The patch is largely same as before. The battle of Dazar'alor happens, but Nathanos is not there, he is at Kalimdor. The reason for the battle is that the Alliance wanted to cripple Horde by disabling the Zandalari allies they gained, which they hoped to achieve by making Rastakhan sign peace but Rastakhan was too proud, and Horde defended the city.

 A new raid: Terror of Darkshore, with 8 bosses and Tyrande/Nathanos as the final bosses for each factions.
 Army of the Dark Moon is retaking Darkshore and the surrounding regions that are Horde-occupied, and the Terror of Darkshore cinematic is the opening cinematic for the raid. Throughout the raid, Nelfs push deeper and deeper, retaking their lands one by one. The wall of wisps Malfurion once erected is erected once again, providing a level of defense for Alliance. At the end of the raid, Nathanos dies, with the same cinematic as For Teldrassil. The raid concludes with Tyrande's victory, after which she progressed to fight and kill Nathanos. Horde players are mass-wiped by a mechanic near her boss encounter, and later ressurected by Zekhan asking the Valkyrs(the two that were at Darkshore originally) present. Those Valkyrs are later both slain in a boss encounter for Alliance, before the encounter with Nathanos.
 Patch 8.1: Alliance victory, though the Battle of Dazar'alor was a draw with relatively more losses at the Horde side, Terror of Darkshore was definitely Alliance victory.

Patch 8.1.5; the Naga begin attacking the shores of both continents, and there is a questline concerning Sylvanas taking a small forces to Northrend. Horde players mainly accompany and protect her, but towards the ending, she suddenly disappears, prompting the player to find her, but then again reappears on her own. Alliance players, led by Greymane, mainly try to find her and kill/capture her, but towards the end, they are faced with some remnants of the Scourge, and have to retreat.

To be continued..."
Priestesses of the Moon,warcraftlore,wr0322,2022-08-17 17:03:10,29,0.72,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/wr0322/priestesses_of_the_moon/,Cult-of-Eden,Discussion,"The Sisterhood of Elune, the Night Elf religious authority, do not channel the Light. 

Every cinematic, every depiction of Tyrande Whisperwind has always shown her magic to be a pale blue or white as if calling the Moonlight to aid her. Which makes sense, the Night Elves revere and worship Mother Moon, but... Mother Moon has no real connection to the Light, and neither do the Night Elves at large.

Night Elves, like all other elves, have a crippling addiction to magic that they rely on to survive. The Blood Elves had Fel, and then Light via the Sunwell, the Nightborne have the Arcane Tree, the Night Elves have the Moonwells. But therein lies the issue, 

Moonwells are filled with water from the Well of Eternity, a pool of extremely volatile *Arcane* magic. The Night Elves, though disavowing Arcane magic during and after the Legion invasion is what sent the Blood Elves off to Quel'Thalas, but the Night Elves, despite swearing off Arcane Magic, still fill their Moonwells with it. In their culture Moonwells are purified by Nature, requiring tribute from the forests and animals nearby before being established in any new area they populate. 

The Moonwells are ritually purified by submerging the tribute of the forest alongside other practices, and then these Moonwells can protect, restore, and service the nearby lands for years. Night Elves ritually submerge their dead, their food, etc. as it is believed to purify the soul or the nutrients before burial/consumption. 

The significance of Moonwells being filled with Arcane magic is very important to note out of all of this, because Arcane Magic is the most versatile of the magics we know. It can be manipulated to present *and* affect as if it were something else. Mages do not use Fire or Ice, they use Arcane shaped like Fire and Ice. Mana food does not actually fill someone up, but it affects as if it did. 

A secondary, but extremely prolific user of Arcane Magic would be Balance Druids. They are empowered by Astral Alignment, Solar and Lunar energies. The cosmos are the origins of Arcane Magic via the Titans, and Druids have discovered a way to channel the Arcane woven into Nature. This is important because the first three mortal students of Cenarius were Malfurion, Illidan, and Tyrande. 

Tyrande's magic (and by proxy, the Priestesses of the Moon's magic) manifests as a pale blue/white instead of Gold, not because of her connection to Mother Moon, but rather her complete disconnection from the Light. They use Nature and Arcane magic that is manipulated to work as if it *were* Light. 

And the Moonwells further confirm this, as the rituals performed in the creation of a Moonwell likely is a binding one that manipulates the Arcane waters and weaves it into appearing as Nature magic, or combines Nature and Arcane into what the Night Elves draw power from."

Just some general thoughts:

-If some units have higher armor on their front, they are better at charging the opponent (anti death ball) but would get punished by concaves or split armies.

-Units with higher armor on their rear (think turtle shell) would be better at running past things or away from things. Against slow shooting opponents you could even move into them, and turn your unit when they get shot at ‚Äî would be akin to making moonwells with your wisp and immediately cancelling to prevent your wisp from dying to an incoming Farseer attack

The only RTS I‚Äôve seen with positional unit armor was Homeworld, and it created some interesting dynamics back then.

If the visuals were clear and it was well explained, I think there is certainly some potential in this game. Could even be an actual ‚Äúshield‚Äù that is visible like in Overwatch on Reinhaart to make it more clear where the unit is vulnerable from."

Does Anyone Else Feel like the War of Thorns was written around a conclusion and not what is logical? (Long/Opinion),warcraftlore,v7h8m2,2022-06-08 00:52:19,83,0.93,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/v7h8m2/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_war_of_thorns_was/,Sheuteras,Discussion,"The title expressed a criticism I feel that I have had since the story became available in it's earlier form on betas/PTRs or the earliest excerpts of the book. I believe many people pointed out the heaping mound of inconsistencies that were found within the questlines and the novellas, just with one another. Moments in the Alliance and Horde questline that simply couldn't overlap, such as everyone in Astranaar being blighted... when the Horde questline is killing them with assassins, neither of which I believe even happen in the Novellas when they attack the place. I also noted even within the Alliance side of the quest, a lot of small scale retcons that didn't seem to make much sense outside of just facilitating an outcome that was pre-determined before the steps to meet it were created? Such as their treatment of a purified tribe of Furbolg as going feral and attacking ANYTHING when provoked by the Horde, even attacking a race historically allied with them when they aren't corrupted by fel or shadow. Or the inconsistency of all Sentinel forces and powers from Darnassus being pulled, yet also... still being there while the city is burning. Despite being pulled out and put somewhere else in the earlier stages of the questline. Even the aftermath of the War of Thorns and it's narrative of 'so many dead elves' seems contradicted, because their forces remain in the regions after the battles are over to keep fighting, even before the Army of the Black Moon. Not only that, but for a supposedly weakened race that would value it's forces, they seem completely willing to give a good amount of Sentinels to a suicide mission in Dazar'alor, and to be present inside Durotar.

&#x200B;

Looking past what is actually written into the substance of the plot, it also feels like plenty of details were simply left out of the storyline to reach that end goal regardless of what existed. Going beyond the territory of nitpicking details that seemed ignored or not considered, such as: Ancients and scry through the elements themselves, or  the lack of any creative usage of Kalimdor to defend themselves despite druidism once being described as really only being limited by ones imagination, or other details that are simply always going to not make sense and never made sense in the first place, it feels like a lot that actually WOULD matter simply didn't. *I mean  the Dragonflights essentially charged the Kaldorei with most of their territories, so trying to take it from them is kind of an attack on them... which is one of those things WoW lore always has seemed to kind of avoid addressing, and is one of those things that just sort of shows how Night Elves def were not originally created in a way that could cleanly fit either faction and it was something the lore has always struggled with making work.*

&#x200B;

Just on a surface level, it felt like the Kaldorei and related forces were nerfed even beyond the Sentinels themselves. The Ancients, the entish ones, are admittedly always a bit inconsistent to suit the narrative of a story. Despite what descriptions we have for many like the Ancients of Lore, we never see them use much power attributed to them. Other times we see Ancients Protectors do insane stuff, like being able to make giant exploding moonfire beams that can destroy structures in one hit. We've seen Ancients of War pummel Dragon Consorts, who are some of the strongest dragons in their respective flights after the Aspects, into the ground. On some level this actually is explained briefly by the Azerite situation. However, this actually leads on to my second point, as a criticism of blizzards usage of Titan Blood. Mainly- blizzard seemed to forget that Night Elves have been using it for upwards for 15,000 years, and 10,000 of those had it being used as a booster for the powers of nature and Elune. I mean the Teldrassil questline itself allows the player to channel enough power to fight an army, just with some of the waters from the wells around the surface of Teldrassil. Which stands out as one of those moments major to the story of Teldrassil itself, that stands out to people who've spent time doing it's story, the thing about to be sacrificed.

&#x200B;

And yet, despite that... the existence of these sources of power is never even brought up. Not even for defending the tree itself from the flames or bolstering the ones channeling portals with the power of the Well of Eternity itself to evacuate everyone. Let alone as a weapon to defend their sacred charge. This isn't even the only time. No Mountain Giants, despite what the Horde is currently doing effectively amounting to interfering with one of the only races we knew were actively trying to work on healing the planet (as seen with the mention on Moonwells in Silithus). Chimaera are apparently being hunted by Kaldorei for foodstock in Darkshore, despite their emphatic link together and the bounty that Teldrassil or the ocean provides, and their exceptional potential in war with lightning and acid breath. We were told that the Kaldorei were mustering every power available to them... but so many of those powers tied to the locations currently being used as the focus of the active story, are outright just being ignored. It's like despite wanting this to apparently destroy so many Kaldorei, they don't want the Kaldorei to fight without having an arm and a leg tied. The means through which the Horde eventually flanks from Felwood makes very little sense too. If these tunnels existed and would allow demons from Felwood or Trolls who had aligned with Hellscream to infiltrate their lands again, they'd destroy them. They'd have destroyed them in Cata. All of the people in Felwood would have seen the Horde moving and sent word, because history shows that the Horde can and will kill members of the Cenarion Circle when they are in Kaldorei lands. (The Ordanus quest from Classic and Cata as an example.) The land itself speaks to the Druids, the Horde's intentions did not bode well for Teldrassil... there is no reason for the 'tunnel' strategy to work, that doesn't also have a reasonable retort within Kaldorei lore that makes it seem out of place.

&#x200B;

It feels to me like the end resolution was planned before the actual journey, and that resolution came before the established lore. But the story innately involves so many external forces, that it cannot help but feel that the Kaldorei were being cheapened by a plot that didn't want to proactively acknowledge the capabilities of their race. Malfurion is probably the best individual example of this in the entire plot. WoW generally tries to nerf him in Legion and BfA (despite his place as an absurdly strong character coming from more than just books) so while I won't dwell on it... Malfurion is a bit too powerful. He has done things far beyond what was shown in the books or in-game for the pre-patch. The story also didn't seem to fully want to discuss the implication of assassinating him in the first place. He is the leader and founder of the Cenarion Circle. He is generally one of the most peaceful and tolerant of the Kaldorei, one of the only ones the Horde might actually be able to use to keep themselves from being wiped out by an enraged Alliance should they fail to win the war, due to the presence of Tauren like Hamuul with personal connections to Malfurion. Cenarius, who we know has been active again since the Broken Shore patch due to the Val'sharah invasion, views him as a son. His intentions were very clear at the end of Legion: they have to heal Azeroth. From that angle, WHAT stops the Wild Gods, the Cenarion Circle whose leader is being attacked, and the Dragonflights with personal ties to him, from flanking the Horde through the Dream portals? I mean, they used them already for troop movement back in Cata, and the portal in Ashenvale is active. They could possibly stop a war FROM THE START and keep both sides from exploding while the world itself is dying, so all focus could be kept on keeping the planet alive. For anyone who would say the Dragonflights would sit this out, I can understand that. I mean, it should be noted the Ancient Kaldorei, with a much weaker bond to the Dragonflights, had willing dragon riders filling one of their cities, when there weren't really any threats outside of mortal ones at that time. But beyond that, Teldrassil burning makes every issue presented with killing Malfurion go far, far worse.

&#x200B;

To preface this: I do not actually like Teldrassil. I think the far more interesting choice that would have continued wc3s narrative, was to focus on Hyjal rather than making Teldrassil. So with that said clearly: Teldrassil, by the time of it's burning, was completely different from the thing Fandral had grown out of arrogance. It could speak in it's own way, and it had shown itself to have the same benevolence and desire to serve the land that Nordrassil itself had. We know it was pumping energy into it's surroundings as far back as Vanilla: [https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Return\_to\_Nessa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Return_to_Nessa). This is actually fairly sensible: that is, after all, what Nordrassil itself did in it's prime. But this was when Teldrassil was only about three years old (at most) and corrupted. As described by Broll in the comics, as a World Tree, Teldrassil was linked to the very health of Azeroth, affecting not merely its immediate surroudings, but those lands beyond the island.  By the time of Cataclysm, not only was it cured, but it also gained the blessings of Ysera and Alexstrazsa. And for it to be burned down while the planet is bleeding out, not to mention likely with tons of resources of the Cenarion Circle still in their Enclave in Darnassus (also the fact it was kind of their tree because Fandral grew it as the Circle's leader? Not addressed in the narrative but when you think about it, feels a little weird) seems like a far more disastrous situation than merely trying to kill Malfurion.

I will acknowledge here in a little concluding statement, some of my criticisms entail. Namely, that a lot of Teldrassil's lore didn't make a lot of sense or seemingly wasn't handled that well even before the War of Thorns. I am sure long time members of this sub can likely recall threads from the earliest days of WoW lore about Night Elf inconsistencies: as a result of how most of our lore is presented outside of the game, how we had such a drastically different portrayal in wc3 the set up wc3 had going forward compared to what they did in WoW, I think it's natural that it's been discussed since WoW originally launched. I actually can sympathize with Blizzard: Teldrassil was something they mainly did, from my understanding, because it sounded badass, but never truly got to look right as the 'tree zone' they envisioned. This is actually why, despite a lot of these aspects in the lore, I considered it possible for blizz to actually improve Kaldorei lore by burning Teldrassil. After all, populations don't matter in Warcraft. *If they did, nobody would be fielding armies after wc3, save the Dwarves, who would probably be running the world rn. Which tbh would be based as hell.* I think the narrative that followed is what adds to how bad it is. The consequences of burning Teldrassil in terms of impacting the world don't really feel there. The way it made the Kaldorei react, I do not actually find consistent with the way they reacted to the events of the War of the Ancients, which were so much worse than the loss of Teldrassil. Call it overly emotional, but I just felt a little burned by it. So much history and backstory in Kalimdor, so much bonds established between the Kaldorei and Teldrassil with so many different things... and it's not acknowledged. Kaldorei aren't like a lot of other elves in fiction. Their history doesn't really portray them as a race fading from the world, not in my opinion. It portrays them as remarkably resilient and enduring in the world, which never truly seems to be expressed within the content of World of Warcraft. It is not like their immortality was ripped away and they are doomed to die: they sacrificed it willingly, triumphantly, as their charge to defend Nordrassil required.

&#x200B;

At risk of sounding like a youtuber, thank you for everyone who read through that. My takes on the lore are honestly a lot more meta and analytical of the portrayed themes and history through most different sources, in a way that I can admit Blizz can prolly never fully cater towards. Plenty simply do not fit a lot of the sacrifices of lore blizz made for the story itself, so I can give them slack for a great deal of what they do to the Kaldorei. But I do enjoy putting these thoughts down, highlighting some moments that stand out the most for me, and perhaps hearing some others thoughts about it.

Edit: Bonus points for stuff that really doesn't make much sense in the events of the story. Mostly nitpicks. 

The 'pass' from Felwood into Darkshore was them climbing down a Mountain. Given how much Kaldorei powers come from the ground you'd be climbing down or fall from the air overhead, and how exposed they would be? This would be suicidal. To their credit, Darkshore is usually covered in mist... on the coast and not the cliffs, which actually would have just made it hard to spot Teldrassil from the shore to even aim at it.

Blizzard seemed to forget the severity of Night Elven military, and also the capabilities of their ships. It is implied Wisps can sense living things due to their ability to find people lost at sea([https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mariner\_Everwatch#Quotes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mariner_Everwatch#Quotes), and all the Wisps on Nelf boats) when a about 16 Horde managed to swim solo under their fleet, and apparently just commandeer a vessel and leave? Realistically the Wisps would have sensed them, and a single druids could make it so they'd simply be impaled on the ships wood while climbing it (as we know Druids can shape even processed wood, evidenced by Horde druids in Tides of War. Actually, the Wisps themselves could do this too. Elune also controls water, referenced one in Cataclysm IN THE DARKSHORE STORY and once in an item in Nazjatar, so a single Warrior Priestess could just crush them in the depths. But at the same time, they could also just refuse to serve the Orc demanding they pilot their ship towards Teldrassil. A wisp could them by self destructing, and we know Kaldorei souls were turning into Wisps at the time of War of Thorns because of ALL OF THEM becoming wisps in Astranaar. And we see in 8.1, their wisps just pop out without needing anything. And even then, it'd give them time to warn the rest of the fleet and get these infiltrators killed. Just generally only makes sense if the Night Elves are static NPCs and not an actual fleshed out culture of devoted warrior stewards themselves. Since their introduction to the setting, Kaldorei have shown they're willing to destroy their own souls to save Kalimdor and their people, as far back as the Third War.

Lorash... works fine narratively if he's a descendent of an ancient quel'dorei, and not older than all the entire monarchy of Silvermoon lol. But to be quite honest, with the stuff he pulls? Even if he was 7,000, doesn't change that they kinda just made anyone who fought him dumb for the plot. .

""While perched on a tree branch, Lorash ambushed a group of night elf [druids](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Druid) moving through the treetops, using poisoned shurikens to kill two of them before running across the branches in the opposite direction, leading the druids away from the battle lines until he landed on a branch that was only capable of holding a single creature's weight. When four of the druids leaped to his branch, he stepped off and landed on the ground far below. Lorash, Chikkers, and the goblin's pet [Captain](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_(crawler)) were easily able to dispatch the druids that fell to the ground when the branch snapped under their weight."" I am honestly kinda laughing at this excerpt for at least 3 reasons: Druids can nullify poison. Druids can attack with the trees and could simply break the branch under you to kill you from falling. Druids cant fly and avoid being harmed by a fall.

If the implication is that the time before horde got around the Wisp wall was long enough for Kaldorei to need to use Chimaera for rations rather than pseudo-dragon esque creatures of war, then how did the Horde force moving through Felwood even survive? Did they plan on long term battle before? All the water in felwood is contaminated, and the forest itself is full of demons and giant Ancients driven mad by fel. Traversing it feels like it should be a war in itself. "

But I fear some of them would be to game changing to implement in one patch. Just wanted to see how the community feels about some of the following balance tweaks. Very minor and boring, but would be quite effective I think. 

**Undead**

* Nerubian tower slow reduced to 4 seconds on heroes 
* Unholy aura(speed bonus) reduced to 8/16/24
* Obsidian statue cost increased to increased to 210g

**Orc**

* Endurance aura (speed bonus) reduced to 8/16/24
* Headhunter cost increased to 155g 

**Human**

* Peasant armor increased +1
* Sorceress slow range increased to 800

I think elf is in a good spot. If anything, I think staff+moonwells can be a bit much sometimes but we'll let it slide."

**Eternity - Realm of the First Ones**

Before all, there was nothing. No sound, no shape, no time. Within that nothing a myriad of beings suddenly began to take shape. Over countless millennia their numbers swelled, sapping an unseen resource around them while they gestated. Soul.

While growing they had no true concept of self or others or place, just a dreamlike awareness of existence. Even after their growth was complete they simply drifted in the sea of space without knowing sight, or touch or sound. Not even hunger, as once they had fully developed they no longer needed Soul to sustain them. Then all at once they experienced the first sound to ever exist.

Something began to scream.

The last unborn being had been feeding on the latent Soul when suddenly there was none left. For the first time in history rage and fear existed in the Universe, culminating in the blood curdling howls and fits of anxious sobbing. At this moment, this being was the first to ever experience starvation.

Fear filled their hearts and woke them from their drifting dreams. Finally experiencing the world around them with all senses, they were stunned for just a moment until the screaming turned their focus. They could tell it was their brother, but also not. Unlike the ethereal starlight they emitted from their celestial forms, his body was decaying into a churning mass of flesh with amber blood streaming from the deep lacerations he inflicted upon himself as he struggled against starvation.

The beings wept at the sight of their brother, pleading to each other for someone to end his torment. With a sudden shudder their brother stopped screaming and an equally deafening silence fell as all went still. Suddenly he lunged at the closest of his siblings and devoured their essence until nothing remained.

He stood up slowly then doubled over and retched, spitting out countless writhing flesh worms into the sea below him, then collapsed and began to claw at his mangled form. Instead of slaying their cannibalistic brother, a collective sense of responsibility and fraternal love drove the beings to shackle him to protect him from himself. After the binding, they stood motionless in the now quiet expanse, each internally absorbing both the scene they had just witnessed and the world around them.  The starry sea they stood in extended beyond sight and yet it felt cold and lifeless. Strangely the dark void emanating around their brother was intoxicatingly warm and inviting.

He began to shudder and seas around him began to flow into his heaving body, causing him to writhe in agony. He began to struggle against it and attempted to inflict harm upon himself as he cried with violent whimpers.

Yet again, he was starving. 

The beings tried to channel some of their Soul into an external source, a sphere of power that is reminiscent of a ""world soul"", but these paltry morsels only inflamed his appetite. They lacked the density found in his brothers and sisters. The creeping realization entered each of their minds, ‚ÄúOnly by offering ourselves can we sustain him.‚Äù If they did nothing, their brother would starve to death by their inaction, but action would mean sacrificing their very lives. They stood still feeling helpless, an uneasiness of uncertainty paralyzing them to the core.

After the screams grew too much, one knelt before the beast and allowed himself to be devoured, and he was eaten with savage fury. At that moment they knew there was no other choice. No matter the cost, they would find a way to sustain him, the aberrant brother they nicknamed The Father. If they were all devoured before they could save him, there would be no one left to try. If starvation, fear, and fury could create whatever their brother had become, they were sure an equally powerful being nurtured by plenty, hope, and love could bring an end to his eternal hunger. This was the initial plan, but soon things would turn sour.

\-

As the soul had been drained from Eternity, they needed a new source to create and mature world souls to feed him before their numbers were decimated, as well as create the ultimate counterpart for The Father to neutralize his hunger. In order to cross the Veil into the Great Dark Beyond and build world souls, they utilized all the ingenuity they could muster. The worms were fed souls and developed into living shells, as through testing they found that the void flesh was able to pass through the barrier. Within the shells they created Tomb Vessels, which carried machines and resources needed to carry out the plan. (The architecture of the Tomb Vessels are like the Sepulcher of the First Ones, and this style was replicated by Titans and titan keepers) Everything from devices to primeval creatures in stasis were aboard. Elune provided the Naaru to function as border defenses against the unknown in this new world, and also sent devices to create moons to generate tidal shifts that would regulate the world soul‚Äôs vitals. Several beings sacrificed vast amounts of soul for the creation of these constructs and devices, and in doing so they were weakened enough to also pass through the barrier within the living ships as well. They would serve as the architects, the First Ones to pass through the Veil.

After crossing, they created a realm to house their machinery and siphon soul from the Great Dark. The Old Gods and the Naaru, who numbered in the thousands to carry the cargo and act as protection were left to drift through space and were not permitted within the realm. Within they create a funnel, Oribos, and several pockets of storage space with portals to each of them for collection. Work progressed slowly but eventually the Sepulcher, the device used to create world souls, was completed. They realized their numbers were too few to operate the device and manage the soul, so they first created the Eternal Ones to control flow and storage of souls. Over time the Eternals crafted their designated places to suit them, but the First Ones didn't care as long as the soul still flowed. During this period Zovaal was contacted by Harbaron, who used a secret network of passages through unknown planes to bring Zovaal before The Father in an attempt to sway him to their side. Zovaal initially agreed, but was secretly terrified by both Eternity and The Father, and returned to his duties shaken. Seeking a way to destroy Eternity, Zovaal attacked the First Ones within the sepulcher just as Azeroth was completed. Weakened by the work, his attack was a success and the defeated First Ones retreated into the Great Dark. Zovaal then tried to operate the Machine of Origination to reverse the flow of souls from Azeroth into himself, but was stopped and captured by the other Eternals who discovered his treachery. The Primus used magic he discovered within the Sepulcher to exile Zovaal to the Maw. Domination magic had been created originally by the First Ones to bend reality, creating constructs and world souls. The remaining Eternals sealed the Sepulcher away and tended to their realms, eventually losing memory of the First Ones and the Sepulcher. Zovaal never forgot.

The First Ones had now lost control of the Shadowlands and returned to the Great Dark, only to find themselves in a war between the Naaru and Old Gods. The Old Gods had grown hungry in their absence and had begun to feast upon infant world souls and Naaru alike. The Naaru suffered terrible losses, but in a final effort a large number self-destructed to hold the line. The Light and Void within them exploded and shrouded the Veil with an impenetrable cloud of energy called the Twisting Nether.

With no way to return home, the First Ones retreated deeper into the Great Dark. Some sealed themselves within facilities on moons that orbited world souls, while others lost consciousness and went adrift within their Tomb Vessels. Over time they withered and most lost memory of what they once were, and several of the drifting ships ended up crashing onto world soul planets. One was Azeroth, where the ship made landfall in what is today known as the Dragon Isles. Amidst the wreckage, the Titankeeper Tyr found two things of interest; five geodesic golden orbs and a powerful device that was of similar design to others deep within Titan facilities across Azeroth. The five orbs would be later known as Sparks of Tyr. They were the five keys used to enter the vault and also served as a form of access pass, allowing the holder to wield reality bending Domination magic. The keys held by the Eternal Ones were merely copies and only possessed the means of opening the Sepulcher in case of an emergency. For Tyr they were weapons, one that he would end up using against Galakrond.

Millenia later many of the First Ones were discovered by the Titans, who believed they were simply lesser beings due finding them within the small moons that orbited world souls. Most had withered away almost entirely and became Constellar Designates, but a few such as Algalon were powerful enough to be tasked as guardians for nascent world souls.

Rygelon still managed to retain most of his memories but was in stasis, but awakened and returned to the Shadowlands when the Sepulcher was unlocked to attempt to contact Eternity, but he was Dominated instead. Zovaal wanted to bring about ""Eternity's End"", channeling the now overwhelming amount of Anima within Azeroth and using it to wipe Eternity from existence and rewrite the rules of the universe in his own image.

\- - -- - - - - - - -

Quick note on Elune:

When it was decided that penetrating the veil and growing world souls in the Great Dark Beyond was the only option, Elune was charged with creating defenses to keep the growing world souls safe. She first created the Naaru, beings of void layered with light to act as vigilant watchers along the borders of deep space. Second she crafted devices that would collect debris ejected from the violent conception of the world's soul planets to act as moons, as it had been determined that a tidal force would help regulate the lifeforce of a planet. Her craftsmanship was viewed as the most intricate and complex.

Eternity Zones Concept

[https://imgur.com/a/pvNidlL](https://imgur.com/a/pvNidlL)

Sanctum of Elune

* Within this self imposed prison, Elune waits. Fearing the spread of The Father‚Äôs corruption and disagreeing with many of the less savory methods of her kin, Elune chose to consolidate her strength and sealed herself within this island refuge. It was a difficult choice. Stricken from grief at her separation from her siblings, her tears formed the first moonwell and through it she was able to look upon the mortal realm of the Great Dark. She watched as countless world souls were born and fizzled from existence, but also saw the strength of the Titans and their efforts to shape the newfound world around them. As hope rose within her, she found the power to craft moons around world souls she thought could also become Titans, in hopes that she could someday find a way to communicate with them. She felt pride towards Eonar's ambitions the most, and when her Keeper Freya sought to enrich the world of Azeroth, she gave her access to her most coveted creation. The Emerald Dream. Elune then turned her gaze to the Shadowlands, and felt a kindred spirit in one of the Eternals named the Winter Queen. She appeared to her in a dream and the two bonded over their love for the mortal souls of the Great Dark. With this a sisterhood was forged. This bond made it possible to link Ardenweald to The Emerald Dream and allowed for the eventual rebirth of noble souls back into the mortal realm of the Great Dark. Turning back to Azeroth, Elune watched over the world using the moon the mortals named the White Lady, and with it she was able to witness the rebirth souls from the Emerald Dream. Those that had been touched by this rebirth felt her presence, and their prayers to her allowed her to interact within the world in a more real way. She projected her power through the Emerald Dream to craft immense world trees for her beloved children to live within, however this method proved to be difficult to repeat from such a distance. In order to create a more permanent link, she created and poured her heart into the Well of Eternity, sharing her love with all who basked in it. Of course, this would eventually come to an end.

The day the Well of Eternity was destroyed could easily be considered Elunes first death, a loss that caused her immense pain and lost her link with the Great Dark for some time. This made it so she was unable to communicate with the Winter Queen which gave her a sense of abandonment.

Her second death came as she was building her strength and tried saving her children from destruction. War had come to Teldrassil, and although she had just granted Tyrande the power to save her people, she also finally heard a voice she thought she'd never hear again.  The Winter Queen cried out at the suffering of Ardenweald from the anima drought, and in order to save their dream Elune stood aside and allowed Teldrassil to burn. She tried to ensure the souls that were lost would go to Ardenweald, both to save it and to one day be reborn. Sadly things did not go as planned.

Her third death could be a few things. The most likely may be the destruction of the White Lady, her last real means of watching over Azeroth. It could be that the Five keys activate a weapon within Tyr‚Äôs Hold which destroys it. This third and final ‚Äúdeath‚Äù would eliminate Elune‚Äôs protection, ushering in the corruption hidden within the Emerald Dream and Ardenweald to strike at Azeroth and Elune‚Äôs domain openly, but also creating a passage for Azerothians to travel to Eternity.

Sands of Time

* When the beings pierced the Veil between Eternity and the Great Dark, they inadvertently willed the concept of Time into existence. Unsure on how it worked, they tried to give it shape within Eternity and it appeared as a vast windswept desert. In an attempt to control it one of the beings tried to grasp it in his hands, but this superheated it into a glass cylinder which shook violently. Squeezing to contain it, the center became thinner and sand within was forced to the top. This shape was far more stable, but he noticed that as soon as he laid it down the sands began to trickle to the other side, slowly as if emulating the flow of time. This hourglass allowed the Constellar the ability to see through time, but his vision was clouded. The Bronze Dragons that dwelled within the Primeval Source were highly attuned to time magic, so he had all remaining bronze dragons imprisoned within a tower to experiment further. Eons passed until one day a magnificent bronze dragon suddenly appeared before him. Nozdormu had been trying to travel as far into the future as possible in order to predict the events for the End Time, but had inadvertently been pulled to the Hourglass within Eternity. Stunned by his new surroundings and the ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù being before him, he was easily captured. After countless experiments, the Constellar managed to infuse some of Nozdormu‚Äôs blood into the Glass of the Hourglass, linking the two together. This granted him the ability to see visions far beyond what he could see before. He saw the birth of the Constellars and The Father, the quest to sate him and the powers that worked against them. Then he saw the End Time, an unavoidable future of all timelines in which The Father devours the entire universe. Maddened by these visions, he and many of the other bronze dragons within the tower were transformed into Infinite dragons and used the power of the Hourglass to escape from Eternity. Some did not manage to escape, and instead fled to a wasteland far southwest of the tower.

Seat of the Father

* It was in this very spot that the aberration known as The Father was born. This land is considered his seat, and the realm of Eternity is his dining table to feast upon. In a sense, he is the very essence of the Void and his land is considered the origin of mortality. It was here that he spewed forth the first Void beings into existence. He was shackled to protect him from himself and to contain his influence, but as the end draws near his resonance of starvation has shattered one of those bonds causing them to spill into the rest of Eternity. From him, the Curse of Flesh was brought into existence, and with it the Constellars seeded world souls with a steady stream of anima. When the Curse of Flesh afflicts something, it not only gives it actual flesh and varying degrees of mortality, it also causes some of the latent anima or soul in the Great Dark to be absorbed into that being for eventual transport to the Shadowlands.

Primeval Source

* The Father had many gifts, but the one that seemed most useful in channeling Anima in their experiments was the Curse of Flesh. Early experiments resulted in creating one of the first mortal creatures within our universe, the proto-dragons. The Primeval Source was constructed to contain the incredibly violent flora and fauna that resulted from those tests. Countless generations of natural selection have made the inhabitants of this jungle incredibly dangerous. The proto dragons developed here would later be transported to various worlds including Azeroth. Before being sent across, one of the proto-drakes was infested by a fresh Old God larva, one distilled purely from The Father's affliction of hunger. When its pupae form remained dormant and began to be absorbed by the Proto-Dragon, Yogg-Saron began to call it to Northrend in order to save it. When he arrived, however, Galakrond had absorbed too much and began to experience insatiable hunger. He feasted on all manner of beings, including other dragons, and underwent incredible evolution using the Old God‚Äôs power infused within him.

Fields of Twilight

* An ancient faction of Vrykul was ‚Äúresettled‚Äù here by a Harbaron to serve as slave labor within the Primeval Source to the south. Countless generations of backbreaking servitude have led to unrest and murmurs of rebellion. 

Harbinger‚Äôs Reservoir

* The creatures that were born from The Father‚Äôs bile were placed into a deep basin to contain them. Beneath this artificial sea the corrupted offspring of The Father feast on souls to evolve into Old Gods. At its center is an ancient ship belonging to Harbaron, and a strange portal to a familiar place. Helheim. To the north is the Valley of the Forgotten, home to early failures of the world soul project that were born in an underdeveloped state. Some are similar to what we would call Titans, however most are weaker still. To live here is to silently suffer for all eternity, so many choose to end their misery by casting themselves into the Reservoir to be devoured by the voidspawn within."

To be able to merge stuff even further at even increased diminishing returns.

Past their ""max levels""

Or an additional prestige merge level with minor extra bonusses.  


Either as bonus / prestige mechanic  


lvl 6 moonwell -> 20k -> lvl 7 moon well -> 22k  


or a lvl 7 moonwell that still holds 20k mana but can be increased with either +1 mana regen or +1 % mana cap with a popup window to lock in your choice.

a lvl 8 moonwell willl have +2% etc...

Monsters wouldn't ""grow"" anymore but simply add +1 resource generation, while keeping their original food/damage values. And monsters that don't generate resources get an additional 10 % damage. 

Also solves the current Legendary issue where you can't feed them to the devourer."
