"If the USA can not return migrants to their home countries, should they be put to work to avoid boredom and cover the cost of their detainment?",AskConservatives,1i9up85,2025-01-25 14:22:47,0,0.33,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1i9up85/if_the_usa_can_not_return_migrants_to_their_home/,ramencents,,"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-refuses-us-military-flight-deporting-migrants-sources-say-2025-01-25/

It’s very possible that some countries will not accept their own nationals.  If that happens those individuals will need to be looked after at one of our detention camps.  Many of these folks are young men and without work could become bored.  So instead the USA could have them work in farms or factories to keep them from being bored and also help finance their stay here.  What’s the conservative opinion of this idea?"
Coinbase CEO Predicts Bitcoin Could Surpass Gold in 5-10 Years,WorldMagzineMedia,1i9u2yt,2025-01-25 13:56:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldMagzineMedia/comments/1i9u2yt/coinbase_ceo_predicts_bitcoin_could_surpass_gold/,Jhonjournalist,,"https://preview.redd.it/ormi71nys6fe1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c337ff9df4f3eaf81eff233e609f4d3a2642514b



* Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicts Bitcoin’s market cap could exceed gold’s $18 trillion by 2035.
* Armstrong supports the creation of a [U.S. Bitcoin](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/u-s-poised-to-acquire-up-to-400000-bitcoins-in-2025-analyst-predicts/) strategic reserve, in line with Trump’s proposal.
* Global interest in Bitcoin is growing, with sovereign wealth funds beginning to explore the digital asset.

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, forecasts a future where Bitcoin’s [market cap](https://worldmagzine.com/stock-market/sensex-soars-612-points-as-market-cap-hits-record-high/) will surpass gold’s $18 trillion in the next five to ten years. Armstrong believes that any country with substantial gold reserves should hold at least 11% of that amount in Bitcoin to secure its financial future.

This momentum is also seen in the growing discussions among sovereign wealth funds about investing in Bitcoin. As the dollar faces [economic instability](https://worldmagzine.com/economy/germanys-economic-struggles-continue-as-uk-shows-modest-growth/), Bitcoin is seen as a potential hedge and a way to safeguard against future financial crises.

# Will Bitcoin Overtake Gold? Coinbase CEO Reveals Bold Predictions

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has made a bold prediction, stating that Bitcoin’s market cap could surpass that of gold within the next five to ten years. This statement comes as global interest in Bitcoin grows, especially in light of recent political and [financial shifts](https://worldmagzine.com/americas/2024-us-college-closures-rising-financial-struggles-and-demographic-shifts/). Armstrong is advocating for countries to diversify their reserves by allocating a portion of their gold holdings into Bitcoin, which he believes will provide long-term economic security.

This prediction aligns with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to create a national Bitcoin reserve. Trump has publicly expressed his intention to lead the U.S. in the global digital economy, emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset in the global financial system. Armstrong supports this vision, framing it as an essential move to maintain the U.S.’s economic dominance in the digital age.

The idea of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction as concerns about the dollar’s future grow. Sovereign wealth funds are increasingly exploring Bitcoin as an alternative asset, seeing its potential for long-term value growth. Armstrong sees this as a pivotal moment, suggesting that the future global arms race will be focused on digital assets rather than [traditional resources ](https://worldmagzine.com/agriculture/the-future-of-farming-exploring-vertical-agriculture-and-eu-farm-data/)like gold.

As discussions around Bitcoin continue to evolve, Armstrong’s vision for a Bitcoin-driven economy offers a glimpse into a future where digital assets play a dominant role in global finance. This shift could reshape the way governments and investors view currency and reserves in the years to come.

Armstrong’s bold predictions highlight Bitcoin’s potential to become a dominant force in global finance,[ reshaping traditional](https://worldmagzine.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-revolution-global-banks-to-cut-200000-jobs-by-2029/) reserves and creating a new era of economic freedom.

I've got a modpack made for me and my friends to use soon in a private server, and it performs great FPS wise, but there seems to be a LOT of internal server lag. I have to wait about 10-20 seconds to use a teleport command, chests take a long time to open, books don't open, and in general the entire world will have a huge spike for around 30-40 seconds at the start, before anything works. I've never experienced a mc build where the game itself runs okay, but so much is so...slow, so I'm not sure what to do.

"I see an icon for Canola Straw, but can't enable when harvesting, help!",farmingsimulator,1i9stwz,2025-01-25 13:01:55,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/farmingsimulator/comments/1i9stwz/i_see_an_icon_for_canola_straw_but_cant_enable/,factory_factory,Discussion,"In the shop I noticed the Forage Harvester headers have an icon that i can only assume indicates Canola Straw (it looks like the other crop specific straw icons but has the Canola flower in front). I can't afford a Forage Harvester yet, but my regular combine harvester is able to make straw for things like wheat or oats, so I thought it would also do the same for Canola. However it says I can't enable it when I harvest Canola.

Do I need to use the Forage Harvesters specifically to get Canola straw? Or is it the type of combine harvester I currently have? (I have the cheapest one, dont remember the name). Or is this the game showing incorrect information?

I'm very new to this series and I'm still learning how things work, some things the game is great at teaching me, but other things are totally absent, so I feel like I am just not understanding something.

Any advice or insight would be really appreciated. absolutely loving the game, the attention to detail with all of the machines and buildings and game mechanics continually impress me. I'm slowly building up my Canola Empire, if I could get the straw and turn it into silage i feel like id make a solid amount of extra income.

"California Citrus Mutual: “We’re in the middle of our citrus harvesting ... Yesterday about 25% of the workforce, today 75% didn’t show up.”",LeopardsAteMyFace,1i9sexn,2025-01-25 12:43:53,2439,1.0,373,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9sexn,veverkap,,
So what is chain protocol - long read - summarized by CHATGPT for those who don’t feel like doing the research.,XCN,1i9s4sd,2025-01-25 12:31:32,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/XCN/comments/1i9s4sd/so_what_is_chain_protocol_long_read_summarized_by/,UndevelopedSirius,,"Onyxcoin (XCN) utilizes the Chain Protocol, which is a blockchain infrastructure designed to facilitate highly efficient, secure, and scalable transactions. Here are some real-world applications and why this protocol can be useful:

1. Tokenized Assets and Digital Finance

Use Case: Businesses can tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments using the Chain Protocol.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Provides programmable and fractional ownership of assets.
	•	Reduces friction in asset transfers, making it faster and cheaper.
	•	Enhances transparency, which is critical for regulatory compliance in financial markets.

2. Decentralized Payment Systems

Use Case: Onyxcoin can support decentralized payment systems for businesses and consumers, allowing peer-to-peer transfers and cross-border transactions.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Offers near-instant settlement at lower costs compared to traditional payment systems.
	•	Eliminates intermediaries (like banks) while maintaining security and reliability.
	•	Allows for programmable payments, like recurring subscriptions or conditional payments.

3. Loyalty Programs

Use Case: Companies can create loyalty tokens or programs on the Chain Protocol.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Simplifies customer rewards by offering a unified digital token system.
	•	Provides interoperability between brands and systems, allowing customers to use tokens across multiple platforms.
	•	Enhances customer engagement by offering rewards that are easy to manage and redeem.

4. Decentralized Identity (Self-Sovereign Identity)

Use Case: The Chain Protocol can facilitate secure, blockchain-based digital identities for individuals and organizations.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Ensures privacy and data ownership by giving users control over their personal information.
	•	Reduces reliance on centralized databases vulnerable to hacking.
	•	Enables seamless verification processes for businesses (e.g., KYC compliance).

5. Supply Chain Management

Use Case: Businesses can use Onyxcoin’s protocol to improve transparency and traceability in supply chains.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Tracks the movement of goods in real-time, ensuring authenticity and quality.
	•	Reduces fraud and inefficiencies in complex supply chains.
	•	Creates immutable records of transactions for compliance and dispute resolution.

6. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Use Case: Chain Protocol supports the creation of DeFi platforms, including lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Removes intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing access to financial services.
	•	Enables smart contract-based transactions for trustless and automated execution.
	•	Supports interoperability between DeFi applications and assets.

7. Gaming and NFTs

Use Case: Gaming platforms can utilize Onyxcoin for in-game economies and NFT (non-fungible token) creation.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Facilitates seamless in-game transactions and asset trading between players.
	•	Allows for ownership of unique in-game items or collectibles via NFTs.
	•	Enables interoperability of assets between games, creating broader gaming ecosystems.

8. Enterprise Blockchain Applications

Use Case: Enterprises can deploy private or hybrid blockchain solutions using the Chain Protocol.
Why It’s Useful:
	•	Ensures scalability and customizability for specific enterprise needs.
	•	Facilitates secure data sharing across multiple parties (e.g., within consortia).
	•	Improves efficiency in industries like healthcare, insurance, and logistics.

Why Onyxcoin’s Chain Protocol Stands Out
	1.	Scalability: The protocol is built to handle high transaction throughput, making it suitable for enterprise and global use.
	2.	Security: Uses robust cryptographic measures to ensure the integrity and security of transactions.
	3.	Interoperability: Can connect with existing systems and other blockchain platforms.
	4.	Cost-Effectiveness: Reduces operational costs by minimizing intermediaries and automating processes.

By focusing on efficiency, flexibility, and broad use cases, Onyxcoin (XCN) and the Chain Protocol aim to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, making it a valuable tool for enterprises and individual users alike."

Does it do all the harvesting and stuff, or does it just automatically pull harvested stuff from the grow zone, effectively treating it like a temporary stockpile thing?

3. How worth it is to set up an automated animal farm?

the spawn rates of all bosses have been increased and smoothed out across all gooster levels above level 20. additionally, idols can be unlocked earlier by defeating the 4 elemental goosters, and an extra idol slot was added at level 25. this significantly reduces the amount of grinding required to reach the next big milestones of progression with idols and regrowth that multiply rewards and accelerate progression.

there's a handful of other improvements to discover - the highly requested feature of being able to disable the repeated boss reward alerts is finally in-game! cube farm can now be played with a very minimal number of flow-disrupting alerts!

hope you enjoy - update today and let me know what you think of the new version in the comments below!

Deere - has run out of room to run.,stocks,1i9q788,2025-01-25 11:07:50,49,0.88,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i9q788/deere_has_run_out_of_room_to_run/,Euro347,Company Discussion,"The great American company is trading at a all time high but is facing a lot of headwinds in 2025.

1 Tarriffs - Deere made the mistake of outsourcing their production outside the US and will pay the price with the new Administration. They announced they were moving production to Mexico for some of the equipment manufacturing which lead to a boycott by farmers and a threat of 200% tariff if they do, which wont happen because you cant really impose this tax on a specific company. But this was a mistake by the company because now they spent all this money to setup the factories and production in Mexico but cant really use it as intended.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/)

They also made the mistake of outsourcing tractor production to India. A good amount of production is outside the US, meaning tractors are assembled in India, Europe and elsewhere and sent to the US for sale. Which is a problem because these are not cheap tractors/equipment and someone is going to pay for foreign goods entering the United States. Not that easy to readjust the whole supply chain back to the US and having to pay people alot more money. Average worker in India makes $5k per year ,in the US these manufacturing jobs will cost maybe $50k-$80k+ per year. Profit margins just got smaller.

[https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility-john-deere-exports-made-in-india-tractors-to-us-europe-3000473/](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility-john-deere-exports-made-in-india-tractors-to-us-europe-3000473/)

Then there is the exports. Deere Exports alot of their products to other countries. If we impose Tariffs of lets say German cars coming into the US, they will 100% impose tariffs on US cars, Heavy Equipment and farm equipment coming into Europe, South America, China, Etc.  Deere isnt the only manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment, you have a lot of manufacturers around the world. People are just going to buy cheaper domestic products.

[https://www.volza.com/p/john-deere-tractor/export/export-from-united-states/](https://www.volza.com/p/john-deere-tractor/export/export-from-united-states/)

2 Rumored Pick up truck - There's been a rumor going around they are planning to launch a pick up truck. I think this would be a costly mistake and they just wouldn't be able to compete with the best selling pickup in the world the F-150. Car manufacturing is very expensive as Elon has stressed multiple times, ramping up production costs ALOT of money, and might not be worth the effort, especially if it flops. There is just too much competition is the space between Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Rivian, Nissan, Dodge.

3 FTC sues Deere for Farmers right to repair - The complaint -This unfair steering practice has boosted Deere’s multi-billion-dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts, growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs, the FTC’s complaint alleges.

i dont think this FTC suit is going away, the current administration will 100% stand behind the farmers. 62% of revenue comes from Agriculture Equipment and 13% comes from financial services. Farmers are using Deere Financing to repair Deere equipment, Its 100% a monopoly.

[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-states-sue-deere-company-protect-farmers-unfair-corporate-tactics-high-repair-costs](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-states-sue-deere-company-protect-farmers-unfair-corporate-tactics-high-repair-costs)

Between decreasing revenue/sales, higher labor cost, higher production costs and increased competition this company has quite a few challenges to work through this year.

ICE Raids and the Food Supply,FemmePreppers,1i9pfrc,2025-01-25 10:34:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemmePreppers/comments/1i9pfrc/ice_raids_and_the_food_supply/,Angylisis,,"[https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/central-valley-farm-workers-deportation-fear/3763233/](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/central-valley-farm-workers-deportation-fear/3763233/)

The farm bureau said just the threat of deportation could be enough to deter many of the 55,000 migrant workers the valley needs to operate during harvest season.

""They’re not going to show up for work and that means crops will remain in the field and not be harvested and probably lost at that point,"" Groot said.

The farm bureau said that could lead to higher food prices."
What A Day: Hot Air Buffoon by Matt Berg & Crooked Media (01/24/25),FriendsofthePod,1i9owwh,2025-01-25 10:09:27,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendsofthePod/comments/1i9owwh/what_a_day_hot_air_buffoon_by_matt_berg_crooked/,kittehgoesmeow,What A Day!,"*""What kind of husband goes grocery shopping with his wife?"" — Fox News host Jesse Watters, [outing himself](https://www.thedailybeast.com/foxs-jesse-watters-metes-out-the-most-bizarre-criticism-of-kamala-and-her-husband/) as a terrible spouse.*                          
                 
**Wind Chills**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Donald Trump has declared war on Joe Biden’s climate legacy.** But which attacks are serious… and which are “just vibes”? *Climate correspondent Anya Zoledziowski digs in.*                          
                 
- “I hate wind,” President Donald Trump famously declared at Mar-a-Lago, taking a dig at America’s top source of renewable energy. He brought that same vibe with him to the White House, immediately taking aim at President Joe Biden’s climate policies with a blitzkrieg of executive orders tackling green energy projects, electric vehicles, and, of course, his bête noir, the wind. Overall, Trump’s presidency represents a big challenge to global efforts to keep the planet from warming catastrophically.                          
                 
- But when you look closer at what he actually did this week, a lot of it turns out to be hollow. The Trump administration quietly watered down one of its own most high-profile anti-green executive orders hours after it was signed. Others are about to walk into a buzzsaw of legal challenges. Some directives are “just vibes,” as Lukas Shankar-Ross, deputy director of the Climate and Energy Justice Program at Friends of the Earth, put it to *What A Day*.                          
                 
- Take Trump’s new “National Energy Emergency,” which gives the government special powers to speed up permitting for fossil fuel projects and cut back environmental protections. First of all: There is no such emergency. The U.S. is pumping record levels of oil and gas. And oil companies don’t actually want to drill expensive holes in the ground only to risk driving down their own profits by flooding the market.                          
                 
- Trump also took aim at wind power, which supplies about 10 percent of U.S. electricity. He called windmills “ugly,” warned that wind farms kill birds (note: rarely) and whales (note: they don’t, but climate change does) — and signed an executive order specifically suspending wind energy leasing and permitting on federal lands and waters this week. In this case, it’s clear that *offshore* wind projects will take a big hit. But on dry land, where roughly 99 percent of wind energy development [is on private property](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/01/21/trump-wind-energy-development-executive-order/), it’s far from clear how much impact Trump’s action will have.                          
                 
- Then, there’s Trump’s fixation on electric vehicles. In an executive order titled, “Unleashing American Energy,” the president targets efforts to promote electric vehicles and the infrastructure — think: charging stations — that supports them. But here’s the thing: Trump can’t simply block funding that’s already been approved by Congress; It’s literally against [the law](https://www.gao.gov/products/095406)!                          
                 
- He’ll still do what he can to stop climate spending. In his executive orders, Trump includes attempts to pause the disbursement of funds from Biden’s signature climate change bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. But even beyond the legal questions, the vast majority of the spending in that plan is already out the door. And second, a day later, Trump’s own administration released a memo specifying that his order [comes with significant loopholes](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/white-house-says-order-pausing-ira-disbursements-only-applies-some-programs-2025-01-22/). As a result, Reuters reported, “It is unclear whether the order puts much funding at risk.”                          
                 
**Even Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord — again — may be “[the best of a bunch of bad options](https://theconversation.com/trump-has-withdrawn-the-us-from-the-paris-agreement-heres-why-thats-not-such-a-bad-thing-248109),” as The Conversation put it.**                          
                 
- We already know that the next president can reverse the decision, just like Biden did last time, and in the meantime, state and local governments can still pursue climate policy. And, by giving up the U.S.’s seat at the international climate table, Trump basically axed his own influence over international climate action, The Conversation reports. So, other countries can forge ahead and leave his administration in the (hopefully not too polluted) dust.                          
                 
- Is it all theater? No. To be clear, the president can do some serious damage — and the next four years will likely be tough on the planet. After all, these aren’t his last executive orders. The U.S. remains the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, following China, and Trump has reiterated his explicit desire to boost fossil fuels and stifle the green economy.                          
                 
- But his team can’t just shred a budding industry. “The clean energy economy is here to stay,” Anne Kelly, vice president of government relations at Ceres, told *What A Day*. She [pointed to the fact](https://climatepower.us/clean-energy-boom-report/) that recent federal investments in the green economy, amounting to more than $422 billion, have created more than 400,000 jobs – mostly in red states.                          
                 
**While this may all seem dire, some of Trump’s ideas may take months, if not years to implement.** And others are likely “just vibes,” indeed.

**Cold As ICE**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Trump Administration has already begun deporting immigrants on flights out of the United States, as education, religious, and local officials brace for Donald Trump’s crackdown.**                          
                 
**More than 500 “illegal immigrant criminals” were deported this week on military planes, [according to](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1882614532557926671) Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.** A U.S. official said dozens of them [were sent to Guatemala](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hundreds-illegal-immigrant-criminals-arrested-more-flown-from-us-military-white-house-says/). As many as [14 million immigrants](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/17/us/immigrants-trump-deportations.html) could be at risk of deportation, even some who are here legally.                          
                 
**Education officials across the country are trying to convince immigrant families that it’s safe to send their children to school.** Immigration enforcement at schools is historically rare, but ICE agents were [reportedly denied entry](https://abc7chicago.com/post/us-immigration-customs-enforcement-agents-denied-entry-hamline-elementary-school-back-yards-cps-officials/15833738/) to a Chicago elementary school today. The Trump administration isn’t directing agents to avoid ""sensitive"" locations like schools, churches and hospitals.                          
                 
**“I am scared I will go to pick up my children, and they will be there taking parents from the schools,” an undocumented Guatemalan mother with two kids in Los Angeles [told the *Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/01/23/schools-immigrant-families-trump-ice-raids/).**                          
                 
**Religious leaders are brainstorming ways to resist Trump’s orders, since churches have long been a safe place for undocumented immigrants chased by immigration agents.** “Theologically, we’ll stand our ground against the government — an unjust law is no law at all,” Rev. W.J. Mark Knutson, at Augustana Lutheran Church in Portland, Oregon, [told the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/religion-churches-trump-immigration-crackdown-sanctuary-2746fa5c80aa8e2ce6db878e0d6e1c24?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share). Catholic bishops in major cities like [Chicago’s Cardinal Blase Cupich](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-public-schools-martinez-cupich-immigration-raid-worries/) have made similar statements.                          
                 
**Local officials who try to defy Trump’s orders will be taking huge risks.** [In a memo this week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-criminally-probe-officials-who-resist-immigration-actions-2025-01-22/), Emil Bove, Trump’s acting deputy attorney general, told the Department of Justice that anyone who doesn’t comply with orders should be investigated and face “potential prosecution.""                          
                 
**It’s hard to find a silver lining in much of the bullshit going down this week.** But here’s one: Online communities have amassed incredibly helpful resources for people potentially facing deportation. This [article lists](https://mashable.com/article/ice-immigration-red-cards-how-to-help-undocumented-people) many of those initiatives, including [downloadable cards](https://www.ilrc.org/red-cards-tarjetas-rojas) with peoples’ constitutionally-protected rights printed on them.                          
                  
**As this administration begins to crack down on vulnerable communities, it’s important to remember that we always have the power to look out for our neighbors.**                          
                 
**What Else?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[Donald Trump floated the idea of getting rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/nx-s1-5273606/trump-visit-asheville-california-disasters) (FEMA) — you know, the agency that provides disaster relief aid throughout the entire country — on his tour of North Carolina and California today.** Disaster relief could be left to the states, he said, which could hurt the [poorest states](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/poorest-states), meaning in many cases that red states would be hit the hardest.                          
                 
**[Trump walked back his tariff threats against China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-24/trump-says-he-would-rather-not-have-to-impose-tariffs-on-china?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy), saying, “I’d rather not have to use [them], but it’s a tremendous power over China.”** This week, Trump previously said he might put 10 percent tariffs on China. On the trail, he threatened tariffs upward of 60 percent. Always good to remember that this guy just sort of shoots from the hip and doesn’t believe anything he says!

Agricola,soloboardgaming,1i9o2d7,2025-01-25 09:28:02,51,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9o2d7,mrausgor,,"My first Uwe Rosenberg game. I’ve been eyeing a bunch of different games by him for a while now, but never pulled the trigger. The easy choice seemed to be to just grab Feast for Odin, but honestly every time I see one of his games posted here I get intrigued, so I curated a list of 20 of his games and I’m trying them out in order of release. It gets a bit convoluted because Agricola came out in 2007 but there are like 40 different versions of it. I landed on getting the 2016 revised edition, so I’m not *actually* playing them in release order… but this is just for me so it doesn’t really matter. 

**Quick Overview**: Agricola is  a worker placement game where you are building out a farm. It’s played over 16 rounds. You start with two workers to place each round and have the opportunity to create more depending on how busy you get in the farmhouse. You expand your house, build pastures and plant crops. You’re always balancing the desire of achieving goals and the need to feed your family. 

**Solo Mode**: Very minor tweaks to the standard gameplay, otherwise you just play the game. There seems to be a ton of variety with the cards and combinations that can be capitalized upon, so I can’t imagine this getting stale very quickly. There is also a “campaign” mode where you keep one of your occupation (upgrade) cards from each previous game over an 8 game campaign. During the 8th game you’ll be starting with 7 occupations in play. Each game has a higher score that you must achieve to advance .

Observations:

✔️ It’s not clear to me how much was changed from the original version when they released the Revised. I read that it updated some art and balanced out the cards better to make everything a bit tighter. Unless it was drastically different, it seems like the game was way ahead of it’s time. 

✔️ There’s an authenticity in the rule book and appendix that I really enjoyed. Lots of blurbs from Uwe about the game and it’s design. ••• “This score is good for beginners, experienced players should shoot for…” ••• “I thought about having the rules be this way, but ended up going with this instead…” ••• “Here are some house rules that people play with…” ••• “This scores like this even though it isn’t thematic…” •••  Stuff like that. It felt honest and refreshing, and I really hope it’s something that he does in his other games. 

✔️ Throwing my sheep in the fireplace to feed my kids I was cranking out as fast as I could didn’t really feel that great lol.

✔️ I very much enjoyed the way the game is scored. You don’t get rewarded for being really good at one thing, you get a small amount of points for each of the different criteria. This made it feel like I couldn’t ignore any one aspect of the game without getting penalized on my scoring. I think there are 13 different areas you score in. 

✔️ I recently played quite a few rounds of Harvest and really enjoyed it, but always felt like the game ended before I wanted it to. Like there’s a lot to do and I didn’t get to do nearly enough of it. Agricola is the answer. There are a lot of similarities between the two, but Agricola feels like a more well-realized farm simulator. 

✔️ This looks like an old game, but it’s clean and has a certain charm to it. Going back to Harvest again - man it would be cool to have a game that looks like Harvest but plays like Agricola.

✔️ The first round took me an hour or maybe slightly more. It’s pretty snappy though once you get a grasp on the rules. I could easily see this being a game that could be played in 30 minutes once you know what you are doing. 

✔️ A Plano box or something similar for the tokens is a must. I can’t imagine trying to set this game up and play it without one. I imagine setup will take me 2 minutes with how I have it stored. 

✔️ I definitely need to read the rule book again now that I’ve played a couple of rounds. I don’t think I did anything too off the wall, but I would be very surprised if I didn’t make several rule mistakes. 

✔️ Overall I’m very high on this game. I plan on playing it a bunch before moving onto the next Uwe game and can confidently say I’m excited to play more of his creations."

I just want to let everyone know that Optim Finance and Splash Protocol are about to implement a same like blueprint just like Curve DAO and Convex Finance from Ethereum!

Once ve Splash is a go, Optim finance their ODAO has the most voting power! So the most rewards wil go to Optim pools!

Whats even more bullish, is that all memecoin creators on Snek.Fun, gat a 0,05% ve Splash reward tokens so they can vote about where the generated fees go to which liquidity providing pools!

Also, if you check the Optim Finance X account, you can see they allready generated 100k fees! This is massive imo. Oh, and btw, the AI agent Talos, generated 3000k ADA alone on Splash Protocol

Guys, what if we are in a massive bullmarket? The most generated fees will come from Splash Protocol and Optim Finance! 

So if the ODAO is a Topholder in vesplash tokens, they will bring the most rewards to the pools from Optim Finance, the OADA pools.

Check out taptools and look at the markets. Splash Protocol and Snek.Fun are almost head to head with Minswap allready! Splash has allready more trades!

This is mega bullish to me guys!

See this as a very helpfull warning from the universe😜.

Cornwall harvest mouse found at wind farm named Rabbie,RewildingUK,1i9m57h,2025-01-25 07:42:32,49,0.96,4,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gx6183072o,xtinak88,,">Four harvest mouse nests have been found at a wind farm in Cornwall.

>A survey by Cornwall Mammal Group was carried out after staff at the Carland Cross wind farm near Newquay spotted a juvenile harvest mouse nesting close to a control building.

>Cornwall Wildlife Trust said tussocky grassland provided ""ideal conditions"" for the species.

>Glenn Norris, ecologist at ScottishPower Renewables, said the firm had found wind farm tracks ""add ecological complexity"" to habitats.

>The harvest mouse is Europe's smallest mammal, weighing the same as a 2p coin and the only UK mammal to have an entirely prehensile tail.

>Laura Snell, conservation officer at the wildlife trust, said harvest mice were under recorded in Cornwall until about four years ago, when volunteers started carrying out surveys.

>""These surveys have found that they are widely spread across the county, and they have been discovered in a range of habitats including rough grassland, reedbeds, field margins and even in gardens,"" she said.

>""In Cornwall the species is particularly fond of rough tussocky grassland which provides ideal conditions for nest building.

>""If areas of grassland on wind farms have been left to develop a tussocky structure, this provides ideal conditions for the species to thrive."""

A (not-so-brief) outline for a DLC set in Rika,suzerain,1i9l8fi,2025-01-25 06:43:02,79,1.0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1i9l8fi/a_notsobrief_outline_for_a_dlc_set_in_rika/,ProbablyTheWurst,General Universe,"https://preview.redd.it/ytlijxswn4fe1.jpg?width=991&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0fef4bd93febf64de3fd690df491a17bbcf1ce8

On my commute I was thinking about what Suzerain countries would provide new and Interesting mechanics to the game and lead to scenarios we haven’t seen before. One thing led to another and now I’ve written about 12 pages of notes on a DLC set in the country of Nibiya in Rika. I like this idea as it would be very different from both Sordland and Rizia, allowing us to be in a weak, poor, and unstable nation – beset with ethnic and religious tensions while trying to decolonize itself. So please give it a read and let me know your thoughts… and if anyone from Torpor’s reading this, please hire me, thank you :D

**A quick note on names: I used a name generator to come up with many of the names, and unfortunately, I’m pretty sure the African names I’ve used are almost certainly Rowling-esque blends of various cultures that make no sense to anyone from Africa or the Middle East – so I apologize greatly for that. Just imagine the names as placeholders.**

# Synopsis

The year is 1948. You are **Colonel Kaithen Faris**, the leader of a five-man military junta that has just seized control of Nibiya—a nation scarred by religious and ethnic divisions, haunted by a history of brutal colonization and settlement by foreign powers. As northern Rika descends into chaos and civil war, global superpowers circle like vultures, eager to exploit the turmoil. Meanwhile, remnants of the old colonial elite fight to preserve their privileges, nationalist factions strive to break free from the past, and ancient tribal leaders maneuver to restore their lost influence. Can Kaithen navigate the ruthless power struggles within The Junta, defeat domestic uprisings, outsmart foreign conspiracies, and balance the demands of his own family to lead Nibiya into a new era?

# Nibiya

The Union of Nibiya is a country located in northern Rika, with a population of 28 million divided among four major ethnic groups: the **Narebi** (40%) who inhabit the interior, the **Zhanga** (30%) settled along the coastline (also found in neighboring Democratic Zanza and Zaerland), the **Doumon** (15%) in the eastern border region, and the **Valgo-Rikans** (10%), descendants of colonial settlers. Religiously, the population is split between followers of **Nurity** and **Mossamism** (an equivalent to Islam), though indigenous animist traditions remain influential. The capital and largest city is Jamir. Nibiya's economy is centered on **uranium mining**, **rubber cultivation**, **fishing**, and the **textile industry**.

The roots of modern Nibiya trace back to the medieval Kingdom of Nibiya, which existed from the 10th to the 17th century CE, before the Valgish Empire began its colonization. Many Valgs migrated to the region, establishing cotton and rubber plantations. In 1732, the Colony of South Zaerland was formally created as a sister colony to North Zaerland. After the Valgish Revolution in 1920, both colonies declared themselves as independent republics under the rule of its minority Valg population.

Following the 1930s Rikan Emergency (a series of violent anti-colonial uprisings in Rika) and the establishment of the Rika Independence Process by the Alliance of Nations, political power gradually transitioned to a new supposedly democratic government led by the National Movement for Free Nibiya (NMFN), resulting in the creation of the Union of Nibiya. However, by 1948, mounting unrest and widespread dissatisfaction with the NMFN government prompted the military to seize power, installing a military junta.

# The Prologue

Kaithen is born in 1909 in a rural village in Nibiya, then known as South Zaerland, a colony of the Valgish Empire. He belongs to the Narebi ethnic group, the largest ethnic group in Nibiya. His family status within the village varies, depending on the player's choice: he can be the grandson of the village leader, the son of a local animist religious figure, or a simple peasant farmer. As a child, he witnesses how his village spends part of the year working on rubber plantations controlled by the Valgish Colonial Authorities. He attends a school run by the Valgish Nurist Mission in Rika, where he faces a pivotal decision: to adopt Nurism, cling to his village’s traditional animist beliefs (and face punishment), or embrace atheism.

In 1920, the Valgish Revolution erupts. Valgish settlers in Nibiya declare independence, establishing the Republic of South Zaerland, though power remains firmly in the settlers' hands. As the state grows increasingly authoritarian, tensions rise between the indigenous population and the Valgish rulers. Local disputes also flare, including a conflict over fishing rights between Kaithan's village and the neighboring Zangha village, the second-largest ethnic group. Depending on player choices, Kaithan may find himself involved in clashes with Zangha youths. When his village leader (possibly his grandfather) is killed, a new leader is elected.

By 1926, Kaithan joins the colonial military, where his leadership potential is recognized. He advances as far as a Rikan can within the racially stratified military. During this period, a pro-independence group called the National Movement for Free Nibiya (NMFN) gains popularity, advocating for self-rule.

In 1934, the Rikan Emergency begins with a CSP-backed rebellion in the neighboring Lespian colony of Cabo Zanza. Lespian's failed intervention triggers widespread unrest across the continent. Atrocities committed by both settlers and indigenous forces escalate tensions across Rika's colonies, including South Zaerland. Uprisings break out, and Kaithan must choose whether to follow orders and suppress a local riot.

In response to mounting pressure, the Valgish-dominated government agrees to gradual decolonization. In 1937, power is transferred to the NMFN, which renames the country Nibiya. Under the new government, Kaithan rises to the rank of colonel, commanding a special infantry brigade: the Nibiyan Light Infantry. His growing influence enables his younger brother, Saif, to assume leadership of their village.

During the 1940s, dissatisfaction with the NMFN government intensifies. Economic stagnation, entrenched wealth inequality favoring the Valgish elite, and the political dominance of the Zangha people fuel public resentment. A communist revolutionary movement gains traction, raising fears of a civil war akin to the bloody conflicts engulfing neighboring Zanza and Dorghuk.

Amid this unrest, Kaithan and four fellow military colonels, each driven by their own ambitions and concerns, decide to act. After months of secret planning, they execute a successful coup d'état, toppling the NMFN government. They establish a military junta known as the Committee for National Salvation (CNS), seizing control of Nibiya’s future.

# Mechanics

**Currencies**

You have three main currencies you can spend in the DLC – Political Capital, Budget, Personal Wealth. Of these **Political Capital** is the most important and represents your personal ability to persuade people. It is basically your reputation; leaning too hard on it, trying to “pull rank,” or taking actions viewed as morally reprehensible can obviously damage it, but helping people out or doing things that are popular (or rather look popular, even if they aren’t necessarily beneficial long-term) can raise it. Managing your Political Capital is essential if you are going down the Charismatic route.

**Budget** represents the treasury of Nibiya. It can be spent or raised at various points of the game. Compared to Sordland and Rizia, Nibiya is a poor country. It also has less capacity to go into debt compared to Sordland as lenders are less willing to let Nibiya borrow money.

**Personal Wealth** represents your own personal funds, which again can be acquired or spent at various points in the game. Due to the high levels of corruption within Nibiya, sometimes personal wealth can serve as a substitute for Political Capital – it is therefore of even more importance than in the base game.

**Legitimacy & Unrest**

Legitimacy is a key stat in the game and represents both domestic and international support for the military government. If this gets too low, civil war is more likely to break out. Maintaining a high degree of legitimacy is a must for the new government.

Unrest specifically represents regional dissatisfaction with the government. High unrest can lead to regional uprisings if combined with low legitimacy. Deployment of military forces can quell unrest although it might have consequences down the line.

**Military Deployment and Equipment**

The main new mechanic introduced in the DLC is the ability to deploy soldiers to different regions of the country, similar to the war mechanic in Rizia. Deploying soldiers helps quell unrest but also fight enemies in that region, be they foreign mercenaries, mutinying soldiers, or local rebellions.

Different units have different specializations and quality, and you can also control how they are equipped, drawing from a finite pool of equipment. Deploying soldiers costs political capital, the central currency of this DLC. Deploying your own soldiers costs the least political capital (but could leave you personally vulnerable), while trying to deploy units under the command of the other members of The Junta costs more, depending on their relationship to you.

Should violence break out between the members of The Junta, the position, equipment, and quality of the units will prove decisive in choosing a victor.

Kaithen can grow his own powerbase of soldiers, particularly by drawing on manpower from his home region, provided his relationship with them remains positive.

# Factions and Characters

The following are the primary factions that must be appeased or dealt with for The Junta to survive.

**The Old Colony**

This is the population of Valgish settlers responsible for colonizing Nibiya during the days of the Valgish Empire. Eager to avoid the bloodshed that claimed neighboring Zanza, they agreed to a process of gradually ceding political power to the indigenous population; they were able to find amenable partners in the National Movement for Free Nibiya. They are among the richest citizens in Nibiya and control much of the land and in particular the key Rubber and Textile industries, much to the chagrin of many indigenous Nibiyans. Far from being sympathetic to the socialist revolution of their homeland, the Valgish have a vested interest in getting Arcasia and other ATO states invested in Nibiya, hoping to make the superpower a guarantor of their protection within the country, despite their apparent opposition to the liberal ideals of the Arcasian republic. They are increasingly interested in the possibility of deploying Arcasian private military contractors to protect their property within Nibiya.

The Old Colony is represented by the character of **Hans-Günther Von Caprivi**, the largest landowner in Nibiya and son of the last Valgish Governor of South Zaerland.

**The Liberators**

The Liberators is the name for the coalition of activists, intellectuals, journalists, and politicians who believe the decolonization of Nibiya is not yet complete. Many were members of the National Movement for Free Nibiya but later left after becoming disillusioned with the slowness of the decolonization process and by the retained influence of the Old Colony. They wish to see a Nibiya that is self-sufficient, controlled by its indigenous population, and capable of resisting foreign influence. They also wish to diversify and modernize the Nibiya economy to be less reliant on primary extractive industries. Many have socialist ideals but while there are some ties with United Cortana and the CSP, many do not trust the superpower to be a totally benevolent patron of their new nation. Increasingly radicalized, many are increasingly believing that violence might be the only way to remove the influence of the Old Colony and seize the destiny of their country.

The Liberators are represented by **Walyd Beringer**, party leader for the Liberation Vanguard, a radical communist party within the Nibiyan Congress.

**The Tribal Elite**

The Tribal Elite refers to a caste of chiefs, elders, religious figures, and family patrons who wield an incredible amount of ceremonial and informal power within Nibiyan society. Although Nibiya has a long history of its own rulers and legal systems, the so-called Tribal Elite system emerged alongside Valgish colonization, as the colonial power created tribal elites with which to rule through the indigenous population. Regardless, many Nibiyans do view the Tribal Elite as holding a great deal of authority and legitimacy and therefore their influence cannot be disregarded.

The Tribal Elite view the Liberators’ vision of the modernized Nibiyan state with suspicion, seeing it as a threat to their traditional power and also a path to societal and moral decay. They wish to see a return to old ways of Nibiyan society, an agricultural society built around trust in one’s community, elders, and neighbors. The Tribal Elite is represented by **Zaher Nima Naaji**, the Zhanga Prince of Sunsa. However, two other characters: **Saif Faris** (Kaithen’s brother) and **General Salah** (Kaithen’s colleague in The Junta) also play a role in representing the opinions of the Narebi and Doumon respectively.

**Additionally, there are two other factions that have specific importance to the position of Kaithen Faris.**

**The Nibiyan Light Infantry**

A brigade-sized special infantry unit of the Nibiyan Army under the command of Colonel Kaithen Faris. They form the core of Faris’ powerbase within the country. Although loyal to Kaithen, he can lose their support, which would be a catastrophic scenario. They are represented in-game by the character of **Lieutenant Jabel Musafa**, Kaithen’s second-in-command and close friend.

**The Serenica Narebi**

This is Kaithen’s ‘Tribe.’ Serenica is the home region of Kaithen Faris, and the Narebi community in Serenica forms a core part of Kaithen’s support beyond the military and the government and is therefore very useful to Kaithen. They are very loyal to Kaithen and his brother, Saif, although they have their own political needs and wants. They are represented by the character of **Saif Faris**, Kaithen’s brother.

# The Junta

The Committee for National Salvation, more commonly referred to as **The Junta**, is the ruling body directing Nibiya while it remains under military rule. They are roughly equivalent to the Presidential Cabinet in Sordland and the Royal Council in Rizia, although power is distributed far more evenly. While **Colonel Kaithan Faris** officially holds the position of President, his ability to act depends on the consent of at least 50% of the council (preferably 100%). At various points in the game, members of The Junta can either be convinced to step down or removed by force. The five members of The Junta are:

**Colonel Kaithen Faris – President**

The player character. Kaithen’s role in organizing the coup and recruiting the others has led to his appointment as President. Despite holding the title, it is understood that the committee strives to make unanimous decisions whenever possible.

**General Zainan Salah – Secretary for the Interior**

**General Salah** is the only woman in The Junta and the sole member of the Doumon Mossamist ethnic-religious community. The Mossamist faith has a tradition of allowing women to serve in leadership roles, but this doesn’t mean women in the Nibiyan military are free from resentment by combat troops. She comes from the eastern border region and previously commanded the Military Police Units of the Nibiyan army, which made her a natural choice for overseeing the Ministry for the Interior.

General Salah is the most ideological member of the Committee, firmly believing in the possibility of a multi-ethnic, functional Nibiyan democracy. The failure of the previous NMFN government to achieve this motivated her to join the coup. She is also highly concerned with the security of the neighboring unstable nation of **West Doughuk** and is committed to protecting the Doumon people living there. While not an open communist, she views **United Cortana** more favorably than others.  
During the Rikan Emergency, she executed an order to kill dozens of arrested military personnel suspected of disloyalty, a secret she is desperate to keep hidden.

**Lieutenant-Colonel Mansour Faiz Vogel – Secretary for the Exterior**

**Colonel Vogel** is arrogant, egotistical, and often displays narcissistic tendencies. However, he is also highly charismatic and dangerously charming. Kaithen likely recruited Vogel into the coup out of necessity, relying on his tank battalion to secure the capital, Jamir. Vogel demanded the position of Secretary for the Exterior or Interior in exchange for his support.

Born in Jamir to a Narebi family with Valgish ancestry, Vogel leveraged his heritage to rise higher in the colonial military than most Nibiyans. He dreams of establishing a strong, militaristic state (with himself in charge) that asserts itself as a regional power. Vogel has no ideological loyalty to either the **CSP** or **ATO**, except where their support advances his aims. He is openly angling to take over The Junta and establish himself as a strongman dictator.

Vogel is maintaining affairs with the wives of **Ikraam Abdel** and **Tajiri Mwanga**, creating significant tension. He and General Salah openly despise one another. Vogel is an antagonistic force in the story and one of the most challenging members to remove.

**General Ikraam Abdel – Secretary for Finance**

**General Ikraam Abdel** is both the oldest member of the committee and by-far the most well-respected, having a long and well-regarded history of service that begins in the Valgish colonial troops, then the South Zaer Republic Army and later the Nibiyan army. He is respected by all communities, even the Valgish community, after, during the Rikan Emergency, he defused a situation that would have otherwise turned into a bloodbath between indigenous workers and Valgish settlers. He was previously made head of the Armed Forces by the NMFN government but was later removed from this position. He joined the coup after learning about planned budget cuts to the military and Kaithen can suggest in dialogue that he wanted Abdel to be president instead of him but only took on the role due to Vogel’s objections. Due to the belief that Abdel was extremely trustworthy and non-corruptible, he was put in charge of the country’s treasury following the coup. Abdel is a devoutly Nurist Narebi from the north of Nibiya. He previously led the 1^(st) Nibiyan Army, which was responsible for security in the country’s interior.

Abdel broadly agrees with General Salah’s vision for a democratic Nibiya although he disagrees on how soon the population will be “ready for democracy”. Having spent his early careers having to argue for the needs of Nibiyan troops to his Valgish superiors, he also cares strongly about the wellbeing of the military and will often put the needs of the military before the needs of the country at large.

Despite his respect and military expertise, it becomes apparent over the course of the game that Abdel is actual extremely incompetent at statecraft and struggles to manage the national treasury.

**Colonel Tajiri Mwanga – Secretary for Development**

**Colonel Mwanga** is a Zhanga from Yolal and a former classmate of Kaithen during their officer training in the South Zaer military. Depending on the player’s choices in the prologue, Mwanga and Kaithen may be close friends. Mwanga commands the Nibiyan Airborne Brigade and joined the coup after feeling overlooked for promotions under the NMFM government.

Mwanga lacks strong ideological convictions, often siding with Vogel. Secretly, he is highly corrupt and uses his position to enrich himself and his family.

# Paths and Endings

As in Sordland and Rizia, there are three main storylines the player can pursue, each representing a different theory of authority: **Rational-Legal Authority**, **Traditional Authority**, and **Charismatic Authority**, along with several possible failed endings. At the end of Act 2, Kaithen attempts to transform Nibiya’s government. Success depends on his actions and legitimacy, with failure often leading to civil war. The game ends shortly before 1953.

**The Rational-Legal Route**

This route see’s Kaithen work to establish a modern nation-state that will last beyond the rule of the military junta. Although nominally a parliamentary democracy, Kaithen can choose just how democratic he wants Nibiya to be. Kaithen must identify and work with various actors to establish modern courts and a functioning bureaucracy as well as set-up trusted political parties that will respect democratic outcomes. He must also work to convince or coerce the other members of the military Junta into stepping down, in favour of the new government. Kaithen can choose whether to align with either the ATO, CSP or remain neutral.

At the end of the 2^(nd) Act, a parliamentary election will be held (Kaithen will still President at this time however). If Kaithen has been successful, the results of the parliamentary election will be accepted by the country and Kaithen can then continue to work with the victors to pass further reforms in the final act. At the very end of the game, he can choose to run as an elected president or step down. However If Kaithen fails to build trust and legitimacy into his new system, the resulting of the parliamentary elections will not be respected and the factions and characters that feel they are losing out will rebel against the new government, triggering a civil war. Even if Kaithen wins the civil war, he must remain as an unelected president overseeing the new government.

**The Traditionalist Route**

This storyline see’s Kaithen essentially synthesize a new political ideology which puts Nibiyan traditions front and centre. In this story Kaithen seeks to empower the Tribal Elite as much as possible while trying to return to the country’s agrarian past as a way of reversing the trauma of colonialism. He can choose whether to make the country a “equable and plurinational” where each indigenous ethnic group has similar powers or he can try and make it dominated by the Narebi (his ethnic group) and their traditions. A successful Traditionalist run would see him work to peacefully overcome the various feuds and disputes between various tribal and religious communities. If he’s unsuccessful, the various ethnic/religious groups will go to war with one another and if Kaithen wins the civil war, its suggested the scars of ethnic division will never heal. This run can end with the country under the control of a “High Council of Elders” or with Kaithen appointing himself as the new King of Nibiya.

This route brings Kaithen into conflict with both the other members of The Junta and the Old Colony, although the Liberators can eventually be brought round. This run prevents Kaithen from being able to align with either of the superpowers (although he can choose market his new ideology as “Rikan Socialism”) but there is a suggestion in the epilogue that he can choose closer relations with the emerging Intermerkopan, depending on choices made in the Rizia DLC.

**The Charismatic Route**

This run see’s Kaithan aim to remove the other members of The Junta, overcome the various factions, and become a strongman dictator. There are many options as to how and to what extent Kaithan achieves this. Towards the end of the second act, Kaithan will attempt some kind of second coup or purge of The Junta and other factions. If he’s successful, he will bring the country under his sole authority but if unsuccessful the surviving factions and junta members will rise up against him, triggering a civil war. During this run he can align himself with either superpower or remain neutral.

# Foreign Relations

The three non-superpower foreign nations that will play a prominent role in the story are Democratic Zanza, West Dorghuk, and Zaerland.

**Democratic Zanza**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Zhangha (majority), Narebi (Minority)  
**Religion:** Rikan Nurity, Animism, Presidential Cult of Personality  
**Industries:** Cocoa, Subsistence Farming, Gas  
**Alignment:** CSP  
**Military Power:** Equal to Nibiya  
**Economy:** Poorer than Nibiya

Democratic Zanza was previously a Lespian colony called Cabo Zanza. However, the indigenous population rose, leading to a bloody rebellion roughly analogous to the Portuguese colonial wars – this started the Rikan Emergency. The rebels were backed by the CSP and embraced a communist ideology. After securing their independence, the country gradually became a dictatorship with a cult of personality around its dictator, **Musa Nyundo**. Nyundo is charismatic but unstable and implied to be growing increasingly mentally ill. There are a number of rebellions against his rule, and over the course of the game, it becomes apparent he is conducting a Pol Pot-style purge of anyone he deems to be a threat.

Democratic Zanza’s foreign policy is erratic and unpredictable. The country’s main concern is the ATO-aligned Marabone to its east. Nyundo will start off as friendly towards Nibya but will quickly feel threatened if Kaithen is too successful pushing for reforms or consolidating his own power. Should relations turn unfriendly, Nyundo may start to threaten the Narebi ethnic minority in Democratic Zanza or start claiming that the Zhanga minority in Nibya need liberating. Initially aligned with the CSP, Maina might suddenly switch to being neutral if Nibiya starts to align with the CSP. In general, Maina wants Nibiya to act as a bulwark against the ATO.

Towards the middle of the game, Nyundo (if he remains on good terms with Kaithen) may request military support against the growing insurgency in Democratic Zanza. Doing this makes Nibiya complicit in Maina’s war crimes but provides options later in the game to support regime change in Democratic Zanza, turning the country into a puppet of Nibiya. Otherwise, Democratic Zanza’s fate is dependent on how Nibiya is aligned at the end of the game. If Nibiya is aligned with the ATO, the CSP step up their support for Nyundo’s regime, allowing him to cling to power. If Nibiya is aligned with the CSP, the CSP indicate they would support a Nibiyan invasion into Democratic Zanza. If Nibiya is neutral, mercenaries from Marabone invade and, in the epilogue, Nibiya has the option to intervene against them, turning the war into a proxy war.

**Zaerland**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Zhangha (majority), Valgish-Rikans (ruling minority)  
**Religion:** Nurity  
**Exports:** Ivory, gold, coffee, tobacco  
**Alignment:** ATO  
**Military Power:** Greater than Nibiya  
**Economy:** Richer than Nibiya

Zaerland is very much the Apartheid South Africa of Rika. Established in the early 18th century, the territory of Valgish Rika was split between the colonies of North Zaerland and South Zaerland in 1732. The Northern Colony received a much greater portion of Valgish settlers than the South, and thus was favored for investment and development by the Valgish empire. Both colonies declared independence following the Valgish revolution; however, their paths diverged during the Rikan Emergency when the North Zaer Armed Forces (which were predominantly Valgish, compared to the SZAF) effectively suppressed the uprising. After South Zaerland became Nibiya, North Zaerland became referred to as just Zaerland. Zaerland subsequently agreed in principle to the Rika Independence Process, although has made considerably slow progress on actually transitioning the country to majority rule.

Officially the country is a parliamentary democracy; however, in practice, its complex tricameral legislature serves to retain the power of the Valgish-Rikan elite. A common refrain from Zaer politicians is that “Reform is Coming,” yet Valgish-Rikans remain politically and economically dominant over the indigenous Rikans. The Zaer police are known for their brutality. Presently Zaerland is led by **Rudolph Von Heertz** of the Zaer National Party. The country is the richest in Rika, although there is a huge wealth divide, and also has the most powerful military on the continent.

Zaerland desires closer relations with the ATO, who see them as a potential partner in such a CSP-dominated region; however, Arcasia is concerned over the public backlash from being too closely aligned with the internationally unpopular state. Zaerland’s chief foreign policy concern is the welfare of the Valgish-Rikans in Nibiya. If they feel the Valgish-Rikans are being mistreated, they will step up military support for a mercenary intervention in Nibiya. Most other Rikan nations (along with Valgsland and Galmland) are hostile to Zaerland, so the Zaer government is willing to work with Nibiya on trade and security. Being too close with Zaerland may result in a backlash from a large segment of the Nibiyan population, however.

Depending on Kaithen’s actions in the game, he may be able to put enough pressure on the Von Heertz government to finally take reform seriously, especially if Nibiya becomes aligned with the ATO. (If Nibiya becomes aligned with the CSP, it’s hinted in the epilogue that Zaerland is pursuing its own nuclear weapons program.) Nibiya can also attempt to arm rebels in Zaerland, although this will only result in Zaerland becoming more hostile and authoritarian. If relations with Zaerland are good and Nibiya enters a civil war, Zaerland will offer military support (although this will trigger a backlash from the Liberators faction). If relations with Zaerland are poor, however, they will send armed units into Nibiya to secure their border.

**West Dorghuk**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Doumon, numerous other ethnic groups  
**Religion:** Mossamism, others  
**Exports:** Oil, uranium, gas, rare minerals  
**Alignment:** none  
**Military Power:** Numerous rebel groups  
**Economy:** very low

West Dorghuk is a collapsed failed state on the border of Nibiya. Formerly part of the Arcasian client state of the Kingdom of the Dorghuk, following the king’s overthrow during the Rikan Emergency, the country split into East and West Dorghuk. West Dorghuk fell into civil war immediately between various factions and ethnic groups. Predominantly desert, the country is rich in resources, especially energy resources, and the recent discovery of uranium has attracted the attention of the superpowers. Nearly every neighboring nation is also interfering in some way in the civil war in West Dorghuk while refugees flee the country. The conflict is beginning to take on sectarian dimensions due to a growing rebel force of Fundamentalist Mossamists who are allegedly targeting Nurists in the country.

Kaithen can push for Nibiya to involve itself in the West Dorghuk Civil War, both sending financial aid and military units into the country. The latter presents opportunities to seize resources within the nation, although will likely result in international outcry. To successfully intervene, alliances will need to be forged with the various factions of the civil war and with other nations intervening. Nibiya can also send or facilitate humanitarian aid flowing into the country. Another major problem will be dealing with the mass of refugees coming out of the country.

**United Cortana**  
With many allies in the region (Galmsland, Democratic Zanza), the lingering cultural influence of Valgsland, and the general appeal of socialism in the region, United Cortana is the more influential superpower on the Rikan continent. Despite this, their presence isn’t entirely welcome by all, as many see them as little more than would-be colonizers trying to “civilize” Rika through socialism rather than imperialism. The UC are represented in the game by their boorish ambassador, **Yolotzin Eluney Ubirajara**, who frequently implies Nibiya and the rest of Rika owe the Cortanas a debt due to “inspiring” their revolutions and assumes the country is already in the CSP’s sphere of influence. Early in the game, he will offer a deal demanding Nibiyan uranium and rubber in exchange for money and an offer to send Cortana doctors and administrators to teach skills to the Nibiyans. Should relations with the Nibiyan Junta fail, the UC would rather see a socialist government under the ‘Liberators’ Faction. They can potentially send funds and arms to help start a socialist rebellion against the Junta government.

**Arcasia**  
Arcasia, a former colonizer of Rika, is slowly starting to gain a foothold in the region, although it treads cautiously, despite the desires from colonial settler populations to “liberate them from the indigenous Nurless Communists.” While openly pretending to remain distant on most Rikan affairs, the Arcasian Centre for Intelligence (ACI) has established a prominent network of agents and informers throughout the continent, hoping to sow chaos in United Cortana’s backyard. Arcasia’s only real ally at this point is Marabone, which is effectively a colony in all but name. If there is a Civil War in Nibiya, mercenaries from Marabone may aid or attack Kaithen’s forces, depending on his relationship with the superpower. If Kaithen becomes too close to the CSP, it’s suggested that Arcasia are plotting to allow the Old Colony to retake power in Nibiya.

In the game, Arcasia is represented by **Aurélia Bouvier**, a journalist of Geopolitico stationed in Jamir and secretly an ACI agent. Under the guise of an interview, she will approach Kaithen and offer to act as a backchannel between him and the Arcasians. During the game, Arcasia will offer to help develop Nibiya’s industries (especially its uranium industry) in exchange for partial ownership. They may sweeten the deal with personal bribes to Kaithen and offer useful intelligence to him.

**Other Nations**  
**Imaland** is a strongman dictatorship with theocratic elements, as the country is ruled under Mossamist law. They are heavily involved in backing Mossamist insurgents in West Dorghuk. Zaerland may want to cooperate with Nibiya in fighting their insurgent forces there.

**East Dorghuk** is the communist nation that emerged from the collapse of the Kingdom of Dorghuk. It claims rightful ownership of West Dorghuk, but its attempts to occupy the country have faced opposition from the West Dorghuk radical Mossamists.

**Zhao** is an unusual nation, being the only Zaranist nation of Rika, whose people descend from Qinal. A small Zhao minority resides in West Dorghuk, who desire to secede and join Zhao. Zhao, inevitably, is backing this militant group. Zhao is an authoritarian republic with a planned economy.

**Marabone** is essentially a neo-colony of Arcasia. Although in principle a parliamentary republic, it is in reality controlled by a small number of Arcasian businesses. Arcasian PMCs operate in Marabone and frequently cross the border into West Dorghuk.

# Economy

Nibiya’s current economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture with strong contributions from rubber, fishing, and the textiles industry. Large uranium deposits have been found in the east near the border with West Dorghuk.

The majority of Nibiyans work in subsistence agriculture. This generates little income for the country; however, attempting to shift too much of the population away from subsistence agriculture may lead to famine. Rural agricultural villages also form the bedrock of Nibiya, and especially Narebi, society and culture, and upsetting this dynamic may have severe consequences.

The Gulf of Rika is home to vast schools of fish, which are primarily farmed by small artisan fishing crews. Recently, they have been forced to compete against large fishing companies from Lespia and Arcasia. Closer relations with a superpower could help reduce the pressure on Nibiyan fishermen. Continued competition may result in Nibiyan fishermen resorting to… other means… to make money.

Despite rubber being the country’s “cash crop,” it remains a point of shame due to the harsh exploitative conditions workers in the industry face, which were established during colonial rule. The rubber industry is still largely owned by a few Valgish-Rikan companies. While many Nibiyans want reform of both working conditions and management, the loss of the expertise of the companies could severely harm the industry’s profitability.

The growing number of textile factories around Nibiya’s major cities presents an interesting opportunity for the nation as more developed countries seek to outsource production to countries with cheap labour. But can Nibiya balance the need for development with preventing the further exploitation of its labourers?

Huge deposits of uranium have been found near the border with West Dorghuk. This untapped resource could both provide Nibiya with a newfound source of income and be the key to its energy independence. But choosing to exploit such a sought-after commodity will inevitably attract the attention of the world’s superpowers…

# Social/Cultural Issues

Nibiya faces three main societal challenges that Kaithen must face: rural forms of justice vs. establishing a proper policing and judicial system, balancing development and political power among Nibiya’s various ethnic and religious groups, and reconciliation with the atrocities of colonialism.

# Personal Life

Unlike Anton Rayne and Romus Toras, Kaithen Faris does not have a wife or children of his own (it could even be hinted that Kaithen is asexual). He faces familial pressure from his siblings and extended family, chiefly represented by his older brother, **Saif Faris**, who is effectively the “chief” of their “tribe,” the Serenica Narebi. Saif wants to use his brother’s power to advance the position of their people, while often failing to appreciate the more nuanced view his brother has to consider.

Kaithen Faris also has to consider the needs of his own personal brigade of soldiers, the Nibiyan Light Infantry, who are represented by Kaithen’s second-in-command, **Lieutenant Jabel Musafa**. Although loyal to him, they too may not fully appreciate the complexities of politics and prefer more straightforward solutions to the country’s problems.

I was going to change the details of my story, but screw it.   


My future MIL has ignored my fiancé (31M) and me (30F) for three weeks because she refuses to apologize for how she treated us over the holidays and how she has not appreciated any of my help over the past year and a half.

We’re getting married in a few months, and to say this blow-up came at a horrible time is an understatement. I adore my fiancé—he’s incredibly thoughtful and has stood by me through this entire ordeal, refusing to take his mom’s side. I feel awful that this has caused such a rift in their relationship just before our big day.

The first summer I was with my fiancé, I spent the whole day in the blazing sun picking beans from his mom's garden. She had the audacity to tell us from the porch that we weren’t doing it fast enough. My fiancé stood up for me, but I should have seen that as a red flag. It wasn’t a one-time issue, though. A few months later, they asked us to help organize the mechanic shop on their property. We spent hours working while his mom stayed in the house. I expressed how I felt to my fiancé, and although he agreed, he didn’t say anything to her. At this point, we weren’t even engaged or living together.

A few other examples:

* My fiancé and I processed 400lbs of game sausage with no help, getting less than 33% of the meat.
* I harvested and processed nearly her entire garden over six weeks because they were “too busy” with farming.
* I bought her flowers for a special occasion, and she didn’t acknowledge them until I brought it up later.
* I cleaned her kitchen during a busy time, and she casually commented, “Oh, you swept my floors.” as if that was all I did.
* We were asked to throw a small party for her, brought drinks, appies, entertainment, her and her husband showed up 1.5 hours late, no explenation or appology. 

This isn’t an exhaustive list.

Christmas was the breaking point. Leading up to the holidays, all I heard was her complaining about her stepchildren not coming home for Christmas. One of them was an adult when she married their dad, and the other was almost a teenager. This same woman later told me she put my fiancé’s (her ONLY biological childs) homemade childhood ornaments at the back of her Christmas tree because they were “ugly.” So spare me the false sentimentality lady. To top it off, she kept making snide comments about how hurt and disrespected she felt that her stepchildren weren’t coming for Christmas—while completely ignoring that her son and I were right in front of her, wanting to spend time with her.

When we finally tried to plan a Christmas gathering, she kept making excuses. My fiancé and I ended up going to see my family for Christmas, and while we were away, his mom demanded we cook dinner for them the day we returned despite us traveling for days. She wouldn’t accept any compromises, like us picking up takeout or me offering a pre-made dessert. She insisted on us cooking what she wanted.

We also went suit shopping for the wedding over the holidays, and I mentioned it to her twice before the day. Not once did she express interest in being involved. But once my fiancé sent her pictures of the suits, she started acting as though she had wanted to be included and tried to make my FDH feel bad for not inviting her. 

Later, when we were supposed to have dinner together, we decided to arrive late so that we didnt have to cook the dinner, we had traveled for hours, and being that she chose to be so rigid my fiancee felt it wasnt our job to accomadate. When we got there, there was no dessert— I had made a cake for the occasion. I was told the kids had had enough sugar, even though there were six adults present who could have ate my dessert. 

The next day, they invited us sledding with their niece and nephew. When we arrived, everyone was in sledding gear except her. She said she’d rather take a nap. When she finally joined us, she again complained about wanting a nap. I snapped and said, “You can’t complain about no one wanting to spend time with you and then turn down the opportunity when it’s offered.” I left, my fiancé didn’t even realize what had happened.

After that, I told my fiancé I wouldn’t go back to her house unless she apologized for how she acted during Christmas. He agreed, and when she invited us over again, he told her I wouldn’t return without an apology. Her only response was, “This whole texting thing isn’t working.” His reply was, “It seems to work for everyone except you.”

Then the next day, she sent a demanding text saying she was coming over to “talk.” My fiancé told her it wasn’t a good day, and she couldn’t force her way over. She sent a long text later about how terrible we are and all the sacrifices they’ve made for us. There was no accountability on her part. Even when I explained how hurt I was, she wouldn’t acknowledge it.

I haven’t heard from her since, but my fiancé visited her once before he went back to work. From what he said, they doubled down, calling me a liar and accusing us of being ungrateful. They mentioned how they’ve done so much for us, which I can only assume is them talking about the freezer they let us keep plugged in at thier place, yeah...that $2/month electricity bill is a huge sacrifice...

Now we are less than 3 months away from the wedding and its CRICKETS. I am unlikely to fold, other than for the love of my fiancee. I was raised in a family that appologizes when theyre wrong, the timeframe isnt always relevant, however...how much longer am I supposed to wait. 

I would never want to disinvite them to our wedding, however I have a feeling they have aready decided not to come. 

**TL;DR:** My future MIL has been ignoring both me and my fiancé for weeks because she refuses to apologize for her behavior during the holidays and her lack of appreciation for everything I've done over the past year. I've done chores, gardening, and other tasks for her without any recognition. She’s also been manipulative and demanding, especially around Christmas. My fiancé has stood by me, and we've set boundaries, but she hasn't reached out to either of us in a month. I'm struggling with whether I should be the one to reach out first, as I don't want to appear weak and want an apology before moving forward.

"Hypothetically, how many farmers do you know who use undocumented workers?",farming,1i9ikj1,2025-01-25 03:25:41,58,0.74,272,https://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/1i9ikj1/hypothetically_how_many_farmers_do_you_know_who/,J0E_Blow,,"So some people think ICE deporting immigrant workers will make harvesting more complicated or more exspensive. How many famers do you know who use a signifncant amount undocumented immigrants to harvest their crops? 

* Is it commonplace to use a large number of undocumented workers? 
* Would the farms still be profitable or functional without those workers?  
* Do you have an opinion positive or negative of those farmers who use undocumented workers? 
* What is the reality of using undocumented workers- is it a neccesity or a way to make a bigger profit?

I'm not from an agricultural area and genuninely don't know if the narrative we're being fed is accurate. "
NEM (XEM): A Unique Blockchain Solution for the Modern Economy,TradingElite,1i9hsoe,2025-01-25 02:28:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1i9hsoe/nem_xem_a_unique_blockchain_solution_for_the/,Maylights,,"NEM (New Economy Movement) is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that has stood out since its launch in 2015. Unlike many blockchain projects, NEM was built from the ground up to address key challenges in scalability, security, and efficiency. It offers a range of features that make it a versatile choice for developers, businesses, and the broader crypto community.

**What Makes NEM Unique?**

NEM is more than just a cryptocurrency. It’s a platform designed to create decentralized applications (dApps), enable smart contracts, and provide blockchain solutions for enterprise use. Here are its standout features:

**1. Proof-of-Importance (PoI):**

NEM introduced PoI, an innovative consensus mechanism.

PoI doesn’t rely on energy-intensive mining or just staking tokens; instead, it rewards users based on their activity and contributions to the network.

**2. Smart Assets:**

NEM allows users to create custom assets like tokens, certificates, or even loyalty points.

Its intuitive setup makes it accessible even for users with limited technical knowledge.

**3. Built-In Security Features:**

NEM’s blockchain includes multisignature (multisig) accounts, making it easy to secure transactions.

These features are ideal for businesses handling sensitive data or large sums of money.

**4. Namespaces and Mosaics:**

Users can create unique domains (namespaces) and custom assets (mosaics) on the blockchain.

This system provides structure and flexibility for various use cases.

**5. Efficient Design:**

NEM separates its core blockchain from the API layer, making it easier for developers to build on the platform while maintaining fast performance.

**Applications of NEM**

NEM’s versatility has led to its adoption across different industries:

* Supply Chains: For tracking and authenticating goods.
* Finance: Managing digital assets and facilitating secure transfers.
* Tokenization: Creating custom tokens for projects or loyalty systems.
* Document Security: Ensuring tamper-proof records and certificates.

**XEM: The Heart of NEM**

XEM is the cryptocurrency that powers the NEM network. Instead of mining, NEM uses a process called ""harvesting,"" which rewards users with high PoI scores for securing the network and validating transactions.

Recent Highlights

**1. Symbol Blockchain:**

In 2021, NEM launched a new platform called Symbol.

This blockchain is designed to expand NEM’s capabilities, offering advanced features for enterprise use. Both platforms now operate side by side.

**2. Enterprise Focus:**

NEM continues to appeal to businesses by offering customizable and scalable blockchain solutions.

Its smart asset system remains a key attraction for enterprises seeking tailored applications.

**Insights from TradingView**

Traders frequently analyze XEM’s price movements on platforms like [TradingView Premium(Free)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/). With its advanced tools and community insights, TradingView helps users identify trading opportunities by tracking market trends and patterns. XEM’s historical price swings and its alignment with broader market sentiment make it a token that requires strategic analysis, particularly for short-term trading.

**Challenges and Opportunities**

NEM competes in a crowded market alongside platforms like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Cardano. To maintain its relevance, NEM must continue innovating and expanding its use cases. The introduction of Symbol marks a promising step, but ongoing development and adoption are critical to its future success.

NEM stands out as a blockchain project that combines innovation with practicality. Its PoI mechanism, smart asset capabilities, and enterprise focus have made it a favorite for developers and businesses seeking efficient blockchain solutions. While challenges remain, NEM’s strong foundation and ongoing evolution make it a project to watch in the blockchain space. Whether you’re a trader, a developer, or a crypto enthusiast, NEM offers unique opportunities worth exploring."

# ABOUT NOVANEED:

NovaNeed is one of the first e-commerce platforms made *by crypto users, for crypto users.* Powered by the Solana blockchain, NovaNeed lets you **cheaply and easily** buy and sell real-world goods with cryptocurrency.

**Our fees are LOW at 2%! While our competitors' fees are at \~10%(!!!!) Our fees are far, far lower than our competitors due to the hyper-low latency of the Solana blockchain. Our fees are much lower than if we were to use traditional payment processors or slower blockchains.** 

# How we do it:

To achieve the expected results on Solana, we use compressed NFTs to cheaply list items on the blockchain, which allows for us to charge the LOW fee of 2%! Not only that, but if you bought a really cool item you love, you can record yourself giving a review, and if it’s received well by the community, you’ll earn **NovaNeed Tokens ($NOVA)** from the liquidity pool

# Item Standardization:

We also offer standardization of items to allow for production efficiency, market efficiency, and consumer confidence. Many items can be standardized and homogenized then put on a singular line to be traded, helping defeat informational barriers between platforms and brands. 

Utilizing flat rate shipping options alongside these standardized products allows for individuals across the country to have the similar experiences when purchasing the same goods. This can be currently observed within the pharmaceutical industry, where generic items are sold to consumers at lower costs and are easily mass produced. The toaster market is also an example of this. 

# Users get rewarded:

As mentioned previously, an innovative feature of NovaNeed is the ability for users to record review videos and have others vote on the reliability of the video to receive rewards. 

On top of that, it’s required for both sell and buy side users to come up with a common description for each item, allowing for the democratization of item information, increasing accuracy and lowering bias.

# Additional Features:

* **Cashback rewards** for transactions,
* **Live, secure physical item trading with live price tracking**
* And a cutting-edge **AI assistant** that lists your item with just a photo.

# In Conclusion:

If you own $NOVA, in the coming weeks you can access our marketplace early!

Where to Find the Best Deals on Cheap Parcels of Land for Sale,u_TheLotStore,1i9gjr8,2025-01-25 01:00:43,1,1.0,1,https://i.redd.it/ql38t0pjy2fe1.jpeg,TheLotStore,,"Where to Locate the Greatest Bargains on Inexpensive Plots of Land for Purchase\
If you've ever envisaged possessing your own portion of land, but have been disheartened by the steep costs of real estate in prime locations, there's positive news for you. There are still numerous opportunities to find reasonably priced plots of land for purchase, if you are aware of where to seek. In this write-up, we'll delve into some of the most outstanding sources for finding economical land for purchase, as well as offer tips for maximizing your land acquisition.\
1. Online Real Estate Marketplaces\
One of the most straightforward and widely-used methods to locate reasonable plots of land for purchase is by perusing online real estate marketplaces. Websites such as Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com are exceptional places to kick off your exploration. These platforms enable you to refine your choices based on your financial plan, location preferences, and other criteria. Furthermore, you can set up alerts to be informed when new listings aligning with your criteria become available.\
In addition to these major real estate marketplaces, there are also specialized websites that specifically cater to land buyers. Websites such as LandWatch, Land and Farm, and Land Broker MLS are exceptional places to uncover reasonably priced land listings. These platforms frequently encompass a broad spectrum of property types, including countryside land, vacant lots, and small acreage properties, making it effortless to locate the ideal parcel for your requirements.\
2. County Websites and Government Auctions\
Another tremendous source for discovering reasonably priced plots of land for purchase is through county websites and government auctions. Many counties systematically vend surplus or foreclosed land at reduced rates, presenting a fantastic opportunity for budget-conscious purchasers.\
To uncover these opportunities, you can commence by visiting the website of the county you're interested in. Numerous counties will feature a segment dedicated to property sales, where you can find details on available parcels, auction dates, and bidding instructions. You can also directly contact the county assessor's office or courthouse to inquire about forthcoming land auctions.\
In addition to county websites, you can also scout for government auctions on websites like GovSales.gov, the official government auction site. Here, you can unearth a diverse array of surplus and confiscated property, including land, at discounted prices. Bear in mind that while these auctions can be an exceptional source for inexpensive land, they can also be fiercely competitive, so be primed to act swiftly and conduct comprehensive research beforehand.\
3. Real Estate Agents and Local Newspapers\
While online marketplaces and government auctions are remarkable sources for locating reasonably priced plots of land, don't overlook the significance of engaging with a real estate agent or perusing local newspapers. Real estate agents frequently have access to off-market properties or insider information regarding upcoming land sales, which can provide you with an advantage over the competition.\
If you hold an interest in a specific locality or community, reaching out to a local real estate agent can be a wonderful method to locate reasonably priced land that may not be publicly listed. They can also furnish valuable insights into the local market and aid you in navigating the land acquisition process. Many agents also possess connections with landowners and developers, which can lead to distinctive opportunities for economical land purchases.\
In addition to collaborating with a real estate agent, examining local newspapers and classified advertisements can also be an excellent way to locate reasonably priced plots of land for purchase. Many landowners and individuals looking to sell property will publicize their offerings in local publications, granting you access to a wide assortment of options that may not be accessible online.\
4. Land For Purchase by Owner Websites\
For those who prefer to buy directly from the owner, there are also numerous websites that cater to connecting buyers with land for sale by the owner. Websites such as Land Century, Landmodo, and LandFlip are popular platforms for locating reasonable land listings from private sellers.\
By procuring land directly from the owner, you can often evade substantial real estate agent commissions and conceivably negotiate a more modest price. Nonetheless, it's crucial to undertake thorough research when buying land from a private seller, as you won't have the same protections and safeguards that come with transacting through a real estate agent or broker.\
5. Tax Sale Properties\
One seldom-mentioned source for locating reasonably priced plots of land for purchase is through tax sales. When a property owner defaults on paying their property taxes, the county or municipality may conduct a tax sale to recover the unpaid taxes. These tax sales can present a rare opportunity to acquire land at a fraction of its market value, but they also entail certain risks and complexities.\
To identify tax sale properties, you can kick off by checking with the county treasurer's office or tax collector. They will possess details on forthcoming tax sales, as well as a roster of properties that are eligible for sale. Bear in mind that tax sales operate under specific rules and regulations, so it's imperative to comprehend the process and potential risks before participating.\
Tips for Optimizing Your Land Purchase\
Once you've located a reasonably priced plot of land that aligns with your requirements and budget, there are a few tips to bear in mind to optimize your land acquisition.\
1. Research Zoning and Restrictions\
Prior to making a purchase, it's essential to research the zoning ordinances and restrictions that pertain to the land. Zoning laws dictate how the land can be employed, as well as any building restraints or prerequisites. Understanding these regulations will assist you in determining if the land is suitable for your intended use, whether it's for constructing a residence, commencing a small farm, or recreational purposes.\
2. Conduct a Title Search\
It's always sensible to conduct a title search on the property before finalizing the purchase. A title search will unveil any existing liens, easements, or other encumbrances that may impact the property. This information can help you circumvent potential legal and financial predicaments down the line.\
3. Explore Financing Options\
If you plan to finance your land purchase, it's crucial to explore your financing options early in the process. While conventional mortgage lenders may show reluctance to grant loans for undeveloped land, there are specialized lenders and financing alternatives available for land purchasers. Moreover, some sellers may offer seller financing, allowing you to remit payments directly to the seller instead of obtaining a traditional loan.\
4. Account for Development Costs\
When budgeting for your land purchase, it's crucial to consider any potential development costs. Depending on the condition of the land and your intended use, you may need to account for expenditures such as clearing, grading, utilities, and permits. Grasping these potential costs upfront will enable you to make an astute decision and evade any financial surprises.\
5. Collaborate with a Real Estate Attorney\
Lastly, it's always prudent to collaborate with a real estate attorney when purchasing land, especially if you're purchasing from a private seller or through a tax sale. A real estate attorney can furnish valuable legal guidance, aid you in navigating the purchase process, and ensure that all necessary paperwork is appropriately executed.\
In conclusion, there are numerous sources for identifying reasonably priced plots of land for purchase, ranging from online real estate marketplaces to government auctions and tax sale properties. By being proactive and exploring all the available options, you can locate economical land that aligns with your requirements and budget. Furthermore, it's essential to conduct comprehensive research and take into account all aspects of your land purchase to optimize your investment. With careful planning and diligence, you can locate the perfect parcel of land at a price you can afford.\

I (29 M) sent my girlfriend (35 F) a receipt,relationship_advice,1i9f6s1,2025-01-24 23:36:57,346,0.73,475,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9f6s1/i_29_m_sent_my_girlfriend_35_f_a_receipt/,AdWeary6319,,"Okay, my girlfriend of 3 months asked me to drive to pets market buy bird feed and then feed her birds on Christmas Eve because she was out of town with family. I did it. I sent her a picture of bird feed with the $17 receipt saying, ""here's the feed I got—w receipt."" I thought she would want me to to send her the receipt to offer to reimburse me because of the tables were turned I would offer to reimburse her before she even went in the store.
She blew up on me saying that it was tacky, and I'm not one of your bros that you bought a beer for. Granted, I am very financially generous paying for a majority of our nice dinners, dates, etc. She even got in a wreck with her truck recently and l let her use my spare car so she can take her time, and get a good car of her choice rather than rushing into anything. Long story short. I told her that I thought she would want to reimburse me on principal, and that if it is a problem, we should have a serious financial conversation where we lay it all out in the open, and come to a financial agreement on how we can be a team and support each other. She returned my car, and broke up with me. For weeks I pleaded with her saying that I was sorry, and we should talk and work this out. She never gave me a chance to have a face to face conversation about it, and just said she no longer wants anything to do with me. Where do I go from here?

UPDATE:
Since this post is popular, I'm going to give more detail. First of all, she did have bird feed, but it got delayed in transit and was going to have her farm hand she hires do it. That's when she turned to me to do it. Wasn't neglecting or anything. 

She texted me “Thanks for feeding the birds, it means a lot to me.”

I responded with, “Of course. Here’s the feed I got—w the receipt.” 

She's texted, “Is this a Venmo request?” 

I felt awkward that she was asking me this so I responded with, “What do you think?” (probably shouldn't have said that, I know)

Then she called me saying I gotta pay you for $17 dollars ridiculous. She then sent me $40 as well “for me troubles” which I sent back to her. 

Then Christmas Eve night she calls me while we are both at our familys homes celebrating. I pick up that she is mad at me, and then she starts yelling at me in front of her whole family. Saying I'm tacky. I'm not a bar bro. I told her that I thought she would want to reimburse me. She says she feels like she can't ask me to do anything for her. She said none of her ex boyfriends ever sent her a $17 receipt (which upset me because I hate being compared to exes). 

That's when I said look. Lets have a serious financial conversation. Be transparent about our assets and liabilities. Come up with a plan on how we will treat each other financially moving forward. She said I don't want to know your finances. Why should I tell you about my finances? 

The 26th  (two days later) she flew back from her family and was supposed to come over, but she decided to go home because she might be oncall for her work. She called me. I said look lets have this financial conversation. I think its important to the relationship. She said no I don't want to have the conversation. I kept  pressing to have conversation because I was weary about the argument. She said fine I'll come over tomorrow and we can talk about finances. I kept pressing to have the conversation now. Then she said, “you know what, I'm bringing your car back tomorrow getting a rental, then we will go from there.” me being upset—I said, “We don't have to go from there.” Which technically means I kind of broke up with her, but according to her, bringing the car back was her breaking up with me. 

The next day. I said that I was angry last night and didn't mean what I said. I want to continue to work on the relationship bc you mean a lot to me. I'm sorry for how I handled things. I called first no answer then sent this text. 

She totally ignored me, then I decided to go to her place and try to talk to her in person. She wasn't there because she was on her job. She told me leave now. Get the fuck off her place. I told her that I'm not gonna stay if she doesn't want me to, but I wanted her to know that she mattered enough for me to show up.

Days pass no word. On new years eve. I sent her a text that I'm thinking about her. I'm sorry if I hurt her, and I don't want to lose her. I want to work through this. 

Don't hear anything again. Then I apologize more. Recounting some of our good times, to try to snap her out of the rock in the road. She says some nasty stuff like “I'm sorry I wasted my time on you.” “You don't need to recount our memories, unlike you, I have a good memory.” 

Never gave me a chance to face to face. I sent her several i’m sorry messages to the point of near embarrassment. A real blow to my pride. I was trying to be as vulnerable as possible to let her know I really care about her, and I don't want our relationship to end over something we can discuss. She totally ignored my last few “I'm sorry paragraphs.” Haven't heard from her in weeks. Though, she looks at all my social media stories and stuff. Getting weary typing this, so ill leave it here lol.

To clarify as well. I am financially blessed. I didn't need the $17 at all. For me, it wasn't even about the dollar amount. It was a principal thing to me. We would often buy each other gifts and things. If I asked her to do me a favor, I would offer to reimburse her before she even walked in the store. Maybe that is just how I was raised. I didn't mean anything by the $17 dollar receipt. She even said well if it was $400 then that's a different situation. I rebuttled with its not about the dollar amount. What amount does it flip the switch where it is okay to send a receipt $50 $75 $100 $400? Some people here have said to let less than $20 slide. I get that too. I've half beat myself up over sending the receipt and half feel like I stood on my principal. If it was a mistake. It was a mistake of the mind and not my heart.

Update Update: I guess I should add some more information. I'm trying to be as transparent as I can guys. I know I was wrong in ways—trying to learn the best I can. Our relationship was a little deeper even though it was three months. Our last month we had a pregnancy scare, and went down the rabbit whole of discussing a potential marriage and the naming of kids etc. I know this seems very fast. I had a previous relationship that didn't work out and it lasted 3 years, so I for sure know about taking it slow and not rushing things. We had a really strong magnetic attraction which probably was exacerbated by our really good sex. One of her things about the receipt was, “We were discussing marriage and kids and you send me a $17 receipt.” That is why I opened up with what I thought was the responsible but necessary conversation of lets have a deep financial discussion. Where we put everything to light with trust and transparency. Come up with a plan on how we will support each other. She asked me, “well what happens if one of my horses has a $10,000 collic treatment. Are you gonna pay for that?” I answered with, well I think I would certainly help, but this is why we need to have the all around whole financial convo. I wasn't just trying to shove a sudden intense financial conversation on our three month relationship out of the blue. There's some background to this. I'll try to add more information where I can to you guys!"

Life in the outer sect was not as hard as it could have been, but for Jian every day still felt like his dreams were slipping like sand through his fingers. He had the protection of his family's name still, the name and deeds of ancestors hanging over his shoulder like a protective cloak. 

No no-name outer-sect child would have the guts to approach him, let alone mock his failures, but he didn't need them to. Jian himself was a harsh enough critic. Born with a single spirit root of fire, he had been fortunate enough to be blessed with great talent and was naturally pampered from his birth. 

As he walked to the mission hall, he pondered how life had come to this. He was twenty-five years of age today and had been cultivating for half a decade at this point. Still, he was only in the third realm of nine total, being stuck in the second stage of Spirit Refinement. His cousins and siblings were far beyond him now, with Little Xiu even reaching Elemental Transformation. 

He supposed she was not so little now.

His parents and grandparents had naturally expected great things from him, and he was showered in attention from his childhood. Proper cultivation had to wait until the body fully developed, so every child of the Dragoncrest clan was instead expected to master the theory as they grew. 

Unfortunately for Jian, his heaven-sent talent did not account for the fact that he was born dyslexic. Every time he sat down to attend lectures or attempted to understand the family's treasured scrolls, the words would twist and dance before his eyes, a cruel mockery of the knowledge they contained. It wasn't until years later that his condition was even recognized, and by then, the damage had been done. His early failures to grasp the basics of cultivation theory left him lagging behind his peers, and no amount of talent could make up for that lost time.

Still, Jian had refused to give up entirely. Stubbornness, or perhaps pride, kept him moving forward despite the growing gap between him and the other scions of the Dragoncrest Clan. He learned to compensate in his own ways, relying heavily on oral instruction, observation, and experimentation to progress in his cultivation. 

But each *technique scroll* contained years of experience condensed into the characters upon the paper - they were hardly just words. A properly written _technique scroll_ would induce a meditative trance, taking the reader through the personal perspective of the author, a spirit journey in miniature. But all this required that one first comprehend and understand the text itself. 

Doing so was nearly impossible for Jian - and he had to inevitably rely on other methods of learning - oral instructions at first, and when that was too slow desperate experimentation to understand the secrets that were given to his cousins so freely. Even with much effort on Mother and Father's part Jian slowly fell behind his peers, mundane lectures being no match for the treasure scrolls of his family.

Slowly, the support was pulled away, and when Jian was twenty-two he was sent out to find a sect to join.

***

The mission hall of the outer sect was nothing grand, being a small two-storey stone construction built like a hemisphere. A large flag pole reached towards the skies, flying a triangular red flag with a motif of the moon on it.

Jian walked in through the entrance, presenting the herbs he had harvested to the disciple in charge of collections today, and with that, his yearly obligation to the sect was done. He was now free to take a small break away from the sect. Every year, he would use this time to visit his family, greeting his cousins and relatives and trying to dodge the judgemental stares of his siblings and parents. 
What was once easily shrugged off his back, didn't feel so light this time. He had already decided half a year in that he wouldn't be going home this year but sitting idle in the sect would have been frowned upon - so he had decided to use this time productively. 

Attending the sect lectures had been significantly less useful to him than personal instruction under mother and grandfather, and his experiments in refining the Qi of others had been barely worthy of the name, and so he had spent the last year and a half tracking down the rumours of a spirit flame that he had heard about from Cousin Xiu. 

It was hardly of any use to her - given that she had already achieved Elemental transformation and could produce the purest Qi at will, but it might be the break he was looking for. Since he could hardly comprehend techniques, his cultivation was shaky and the Qi was mostly impure, but a pure enough fire would burn it all out. 

It would probably be dangerous and horrifically painful, but anything was better than dying as an exiled nobody existing only by the grace of others. He had packed his bags and said his goodbyes. 

Cousin Xiu had once again been extremely generous and lent him a personal talisman of protection. It would shield him against the elements, protecting him from environmental hazards for as long as he could supply the Qi. 

He didn't understand why she would bless him with such favour when they had only ever met as children, but he couldn't afford to question it. Still, if he ever became someone worth his name, he would remember her.  

Tomorrow, Jian would head out of the sect and towards the Boiling Sea.

***

The Boiling Sea was, in truth, not a sea. It was a large lake the size of a smaller country. No one argued that it did not deserve to be called a sea. It was a freshwater lake, and multiple rivers flowed into it. The water was, true to its name, always boiling. It bubbled and hissed like a snake, and steam and fog reduced the visibility for miles around the lake itself. 

The water was hot enough that it would boil the skin of a mortal man in moments, but it was only a slight obstruction for Jian. Rumour was that the lake boiled perpetually due to the decomposing corpse of a dragon that had crashed into the earth and formed a large crater. Sometime between then and now, the crater had turned into a lake, and Jian didn't care to understand how and why.

It was rather unlikely, being that dragons were largely myths and legends. They might have existed at the dawn of time when the world was largely still uncondensed from primordial Qi, but none had been seen in so long that it was vanishingly likely that any still existed.

Cousin Xue had told him that she had sensed a large amount of fire Qi condensing into a spirit flame somewhere in the lake itself.  It shone out to his senses like the sun itself, a bright roaring star of fire and flame, against the backdrop of roiling water Qi.

Jian slowly walked to the lake and dipped his hand in the water. It was pleasantly warm against his skin, even as steam still boiled off the surface of the lake. He could feel the spirit flame resonate against his dantian, the fluctuations of fire Qi almost matching his heartbeat. 

There was no need for any other protection - The Boiling Sea was mostly a curious anomaly, and the dense fog around it obscured any sensing skills. There was no one else he would see on the horizon, and anything that lived in this boiling nightmare would be able to kill him no matter if he could sense it or not. 

Still, there was only one way forward. He stripped bare and dived into the lake with only a small necklace secured around his neck. Boiling steam went up his nose and the water pushed against the surface of his eyes. But all he felt was comforting warmth like the half-remembered sensation of his mother's hugs. It had been some time.

He closed his eyes and luxuriated in the sensation. No one could tell if a tear or two joined the water around him, but a sob tore out of his chest involuntarily. Jian took a deep breath to steady himself, boiling water filling his lungs. It felt like fresh air.

He swam onwards, closing the distance to the bottom of the lake as fast as he could. Every second felt like an eternity, with the bright Qi of the spirit flame cycling through his body and drawing him like a moth to the flame. Time passed as he swam towards the flame, but Jian Long was heedless of it. The cycles of fire Qi passed through again and again, burning out the impurities from his existence. The boiling water Qi inevitably followed the fire Qi, rushing through his meridians and sealing the changes in.

Most cultivators would have died in agony, boiled alive and burned to death by the roaring energies of the lake, but Jian hardly noticed. He seemed almost in a coma, but if one could see him they would have noticed the sheen on his skin with iridescent scales flashing in and out of existence.

The strange cycling of the energy of the lake dragged him through the next six stages of Spirit Refinement slowly but inevitably. Eventually, he reached close enough to the lake bed to be able to see it. Strange ghost-like candle flames were spread across the surface. From the fluctuations of the Qi around the area he had expected a roaring bonfire, but the scene was strangely peaceful.

The lake surface was ridged and mottled, with uneven imperfections along the surface. He seemed to be in a deep valley, but he couldn't have commented on the surrounding surface. On his way here, he had mostly been drawn in by the Qi, heedless of his surroundings. The necklace around his neck was shining a bright crimson, and the chains seemed hot enough that they would burn scars into the skin.

Jian landed on the lakebed and with slow, hesitant footsteps, walked towards the smallest candle flame. There was scarcely any noise except the roaring of boiling water, and the scene was strangely eerie. He sat down near the flame with eyes closed, smiling widely in satisfaction.

He didn't know how long it had been since he had dove into the lake but in that small time, he had walked further along the path to ascension than he had in years.

The amulet around his neck flashed a bright red and broke silently. 

Jian was boiled to death in but a moment, and not a single scream rang out into the void. His body burnt to ashes in tranquil silence, and then there was nothing.

Far away, Xiu closed her eyes in quiet contentment. Being able to watch the melding of fire and water Qi and Cousin Jian's forced progress along the path by the lake's environment had been very productive. She might even advance a minor stage or two. Jian had mostly been a disappointment, but she was glad that he would not have to face the cycle of reincarnation burdened by karmic debt.

***

Zain had shaken Asha awake about three hours after dinner. It was her turn to watch the fire. The farm was still burning merrily, the fire crackling as grass went up in smoke. There was a slight wind, as the blaze pulled in air and mana to it.

Magic settled heavily into the atmosphere, with currents of mana rushing towards the conflagration, coming out as fire-aspected mana, only to rush in again. It seemed the fire would continue to burn well into the morning.

Zain was not a heavy sleeper, but sleep was easy to come by today. A deep tiredness settled into his bones, but as he closed his eyes, he went not to sleep but instead to a _dream_.  He was deep underwater somewhere, and the water was hot enough that his skin was blistered red and raw. Each stroke was an effort of will, but still, he pushed onward. 

Magic was spread thickly around him and it almost felt like it was clogging his breath. His lungs felt like he was burning and drowning at the same time. Eventually, he reached his destination, but there was nothing there except burning candlelight and a terrifying amount of mana. 

He woke up screaming, feeling like his lungs were filled with water. His heart was racing, and he could feel his heartbeat through his chest. It felt like someone was drumming on his ribs, and for a moment it felt like his blood was boiling him alive.

Jian's eyes flew open, his vision blurred and spinning, his chest heaving violently as his body betrayed him. His throat burned, raw and tight, as he convulsed forward and spat water from his lungs. Each cough was like fire clawing its way up his throat, each gasp for air scraping against his ribs like jagged stone.

For a moment, he thought he was still drowning. The sensation of water pressing in on him was so vivid—heavy and suffocating, the heat seeping into his very bones. Then, his body seemed to remember that he was still over land, and his coughing subsided rapidly.

""Are you alright? You seem like you coughed out a lung! The air is bad outside but it didn't seem like you had any problem with the smoke."" He heard Asha call out to him.

""I'm fine! Just swallowed my spit, I think!"" Zain certainly did not feel fine, but he didn't even know where to begin explaining how he felt. Now that the coughing had subsided he could feel the mana in and around him. It felt thick and cloying, almost like syrup, instead of the normal sensation of light energy rushing through his veins.

His head felt like it would split open with pain, and his brow was furrowed with pain. He pawed around for the pot of water and took a deep drink. His body almost betrayed him as his throat convulsed, and panic rose in his chest again but he forced the liquid down anyway. The cold water provided some relief, and he called out to Asha.

""I'm going to try and catch some sleep, sorry for the panic.""  As he lay down again, he closed his eyes, and cycled his breath in a pranayama, like he was taught as a child. His magic hugged him like a warm blanket, and Zain went to sleep. 

This time, he did not dream.

Step 1: Establish Your Financial Plan\

Step 2: Ascertain Your Requirements and Preferences\
Once you have a financial plan in place, it's time to identify your requirements and preferences when it comes to discovering property for sale near you. Deliberate on what you plan to accomplish with the land and what specific traits are significant to you.\
Are you seeking a residential plot to construct your dream home? Do you necessitate acreage for agricultural or ranching purposes? Are you intrigued by undeveloped land for recreational use? Ponder on the size, location, topography, and any specific amenities or characteristics that you desire in a piece of land. By clarifying your requirements and preferences, you'll be better equipped to pare down your search and focus on properties that correspond with your criteria.\
Step 3: Investigate Local Real Estate Listings\
With a lucid comprehension of your financial plan, requirements, and preferences, it's time to commence investigating local real estate listings to locate property for sale near you. There are numerous methods to access real estate listings, including online platforms, local publications, real estate agencies, and property listing websites.\
Commence by searching for property for sale in the particular area or region where you're interested in procuring real estate. Utilize filters and search criteria to refine your search and locate properties that match your financial plan and criteria. Take note of the pivotal details provided for each listing, such as the location, size, price, and any other pertinent information.\
Step 4: Utilize Online Mapping Instruments\
In addition to conventional real estate listings, consider utilizing online mapping instruments to pinpoint available land for sale near your current location. Websites such as Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com present interactive map features that enable you to search for properties within a specific area and view them on a map.\
Utilize these mapping instruments to explore the surrounding area and gain an insight into the location, nearby amenities, and other pertinent factors. Moreover, these platforms frequently furnish information about the local market, property values, and recent sales, which can be valuable in your quest for property for sale near you.\
Step 5: Stroll Around the Area\
Another efficacious approach to discover property for sale near you is to embark on exploring the encompassing area in person. Take a drive or stroll around the neighborhoods or rural regions where you're interested in acquiring land, and keep an eye out for ""for sale"" signs and property listings.\
By physically exploring the area, you'll be able to acquire a firsthand impression of the location, surrounding properties, and potential opportunities that may not be readily evident through online listings. This hands-on approach can also assist you in gaining a perception of the community, nearby amenities, and the overall allure of the area.\
Step 6: Engage a Real Estate Agent\
If you're encountering challenges in discovering property for sale near you or could benefit from professional guidance, contemplate enlisting the services of a real estate agent who specializes in land sales. A seasoned real estate agent can assist you in navigating the local market, identifying potential properties that align with your criteria, and guiding you through the process of acquiring land.\

Key facets of a thorough review encompass:\
- Scrutinizing the property's legal and zoning status to assure that it aligns with your intended use and complies with local regulations\
- Procuring a survey or plat map to comprehend the property boundaries and any easements or encumbrances\
- Assessing environmental factors, such as soil quality, drainage, and potential hazards\
- Evaluating accessibility, utilities, and infrastructure availability\
- Researching any planned developments or projects that may impact the area\
By meticulously conducting a thorough review, you'll be able to establish an informed judgment about whether a specific piece of land aligns with your requirements and preferences.\
Step 8: Evaluate Financing Possibilities\
Subsequent to identifying a piece of land that corresponds with your criteria and passes the thorough review, it's time to contemplate your financing possibilities. If you have the financial means to acquire the land outright, you can proceed with presenting an offer or negotiating the terms of the sale.\
Nevertheless, if you necessitate financing, explore the diverse possibilities available for land acquisitions, such as traditional mortgages, land loans, or owner financing arrangements. Research lenders and financial institutions that specialize in land financing and compare interest rates, terms, and requisites to locate the optimal option for your situation.\
Step 9: Present an Offer and Engage in Negotiations\
Subsequent to evaluating financing possibilities and confirming that the land aligns with your criteria, it's time to present an offer and negotiate the terms of the sale. Collaborate with your real estate agent, if applicable, to submit a written offer to the seller or their representative.\
When submitting an offer, contemplate factors such as the purchase price, contingencies, closing timeline, and any specific terms that are significant to you. Be prepared to engage in negotiations with the seller to arrive at an agreement that is mutually advantageous and reflects the fair market value of the land.\
Step 10: Finalize the Acquisition\
Subsequent to reaching an agreement with the seller and concluding the terms of the sale, it's time to move forward with finalizing the acquisition of the land. This typically entails completing the requisite paperwork, coordinating with legal and financial professionals, and progressing through the closing procedure.\
During the closing procedure, you'll be required to affix your signature to legal documents, such as a purchase agreement, deed, and any applicable disclosures. It's essential to meticulously scrutinize all documentation and seek professional advice if needed to assure that you fully comprehend the terms of the sale and are at ease with the transaction.\
By adhering to these measures and demonstrating diligence throughout the procedure, you can confidently navigate the expedition of discovering property for sale near you and ultimately procure the ideal piece of land that aligns with your requirements and preferences. Whether you are in pursuit of a residential plot, farm, or recreational property, executing comprehensive research, engaging with professionals, and making educated judgments will aid you in securing the ideal parcel of land for your future pursuits.\

Sometime between 4:30pm (when my finance came home), and 6pm today, when I got home our kitten vanished. We have 2 cats, so when I went to get their food I immediately noticed that there was only one little beggar. This would have been less than 5 minutes from the time I walked through the door. The only thing I can think of is that he must have bolted out the door when I walked in without me noticing. But he’s NEVER done that before and is generally wary of being outside.

I’ve taken him out on walks once or twice, but I’ve been nervous about the spread of bird flu to cats so I’ve been keeping him inside. He’s about 8 months old and his name is Hamburger.

I m looking for help to our cash flow situation.  The loan of 150,000 was financed by the bank in two parts.  $90,000 was secured through a CD account we have through the bank, the rest was financed through a lien on existing equipment.  Right now, the loan has a blended rate of 7%.  We thought we had enough cash on hand to fliat the loan until our first kid crop sale, but now we are highly worried about hitting the wall.  We have one employee who we pay $2000/month and we service the loan at $3000 month.  We have about $50,000 cash in hand.  We have $40,000 invested in the stock market that we are considering taking out to pay down the equipment leveraged side of the loan, but it has been earning 22% returns and we don't want to take it out.  We also have about $40000 worth of cattle, but we also don't wabt to sell our ""cash"" cow.  It's all very complicated to explain.  We also have a contract that brings us a steady $49,000 each year in income but we do not receive payment until December of 2025.  The goats will also travel and do contract grazing but we are just starting and spent a large lump of money on advertising.  Just hoping the savvy on here will have a few other ideas or things I have not thought of besides a LOC.  

Other options are get my CDL class A to do driving on the side until the business gets into gear / wife get a job (she is currently indispensable helping run the backside) / and or starting a farming centric onlyfans (jk, hate that shit).  


Happy to answer more questions and provide more details.  Our biggest problem is just the overall cost of things like medicine.  It used to cost twenty bucks for antibiotics in case of animal illness, now it is closer to $150 for the same amount.  "

Reclaim Your Sovereignty This Spring: Break Free from the Elites and Take Control of Your Future 🌿,conspiracy,1i9c9w1,2025-01-24 20:55:42,1,0.57,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1i9c9w1/reclaim_your_sovereignty_this_spring_break_free/,TheWhistlingWarrior,,"# Breaking Free from the Chains of the System

For centuries, the elites have tightened their grip on the global systems that govern our lives—systems that leave us dependent on their control. From the central banks that print money out of thin air to the corporations that manipulate supply chains, these forces have gradually stripped away our power, leaving us with little more than the illusion of choice. By capitulating to the monetary system, corporate giants, and centralized power structures, we’ve allowed ourselves to be disconnected from the very resources that sustain life.

But what if you could break free? What if you could reclaim your sovereignty and take control over the most basic aspects of your life: your food, your water, your shelter, and your security? This spring, as nature awakens, it’s the perfect time to start disconnecting from the systems that control us and begin building a life where your power is in your hands once more.

# Taking Back Control of Your Food

One of the most important areas where we’ve surrendered our autonomy is in the realm of food. We rely on massive, industrialized farming systems controlled by a few global corporations to feed us, and as a result, we’ve lost not only the quality and health of our food but also our ability to produce it. Corporate farming uses harmful chemicals, genetically modified seeds, and unsustainable practices that harm the earth and our bodies. This is where we can begin to fight back: by growing our own food.

Starting your own garden is one of the most empowering steps you can take to reclaim your sovereignty. Gardening isn’t just about growing food—it’s about taking back control from the food monopolies that have replaced local, independent farming with corporate-controlled, factory-style food production. Whether you have a small balcony or a vast backyard, container gardening and vertical gardening allow you to grow your own vegetables, herbs, and even fruits, all while reducing your dependence on supermarkets. You don’t have to wait for permission or depend on others to feed you—take action and start growing your own food today.

Even if you live in a city, you can still reclaim some control by using small spaces creatively. Vertical gardens and container systems can help you grow everything from lettuce to tomatoes, offering a sustainable, nutritious food source in even the smallest urban environments. By cutting out the middleman—the massive food corporations—you’ll not only have access to fresh, healthy produce but also take a stand against the systems that have monopolized the food supply.

# Reclaiming Our Livestock from Corporate Giants

Another crucial step toward regaining your sovereignty is to bring livestock back into the fold. For too long, we’ve been forced to rely on industrial-scale factory farms for our meat, eggs, and dairy, where animals are treated like mere commodities and subjected to inhumane conditions. By raising your own backyard chickens, ducks, rabbits, or even goats, you can ensure a humane, sustainable, and independent source of protein. These small animals provide eggs, meat, and milk, and they allow you to bypass the corporate farming system that has robbed us of our ability to live in harmony with the land and its creatures.

Raising livestock is also a way to reconnect with the earth and the cycles of life. By taking the time to care for these animals, you not only provide food for yourself but also reclaim your connection to the natural world. With a small coop, a few ducks, or a rabbit hutch, you’re creating a buffer between yourself and the industrial systems that seek to control what you eat.

# Supporting Pollinators and Reclaiming the Land

The elites have not just taken control of our food; they’ve also monopolized the land and the ecosystems that sustain us. The large-scale agricultural systems they’ve set up have devastated biodiversity and displaced natural wildlife. However, by planting flowers that support bees and other pollinators, you can help restore balance and vitality to your local ecosystem. Bees are critical to the pollination of many crops, and without them, we would be left with limited food options.

When you plant pollinator-friendly flowers, you’re not just helping the bees—you’re taking a stand against the corporate control of food production and environmental degradation. A garden full of life, buzzing bees, and thriving plants serves as a reminder that the natural world belongs to us all, not just to the corporations that seek to profit from it.

Additionally, providing bird-friendly environments in the winter—through suet cakes and heated bird baths—helps restore harmony to the ecosystem and combats the erosion of biodiversity. You’re not only feeding wildlife but also fighting back against the corporate-driven destruction of natural habitats.

# Securing Water: Taking Back Control from the System

Water, the most basic necessity for life, has also been increasingly privatized and controlled by large corporations. Bottled water companies have commodified this precious resource, turning it into a product they sell at inflated prices, while many communities face water shortages or contamination. The time to reclaim control over your water supply is now.

Rainwater collection is one of the most effective ways to regain your independence from centralized water systems. By setting up a simple rainwater harvesting system with barrels or tanks, you can capture water directly from your roof and use it for irrigation, drinking, or washing. Not only does this reduce your reliance on municipal water systems, but it also helps you fight back against the corporate control of this essential resource.

For added peace of mind, filtering your collected water through a reverse osmosis system ensures that the water you use for your garden or home is clean and safe. Filtering your own water is a direct rebellion against the centralized systems that profit from our reliance on their services.

# Food Preservation: Breaking Free from the Supermarket Chains

Another way the elites maintain their control over us is by forcing us into a cycle of consumption that keeps us dependent on their supply chains. Supermarkets, where we’re told when to buy and what to eat, thrive on the idea that we should always need more. This system fuels endless consumerism and keeps us tethered to their products.

By learning the art of canning and food preservation, you can take back control over what you eat and how much you consume. Canning fruits, vegetables, and even mushrooms extends the life of your harvest, ensuring that you have food on hand even when the seasons change. When you preserve your own food, you’re no longer relying on the corporate-run supermarkets that profit from scarcity and the false notion of convenience. You’ve broken free from their system and have taken control of your food supply.

# The Power of Aquaponics and Sustainable Protein

Aquaponics is another incredible tool in your journey to self-sufficiency. This system combines fish farming and plant cultivation in a way that uses natural processes to create a self-sustaining, closed-loop ecosystem. Fish provide nutrients for plants, while the plants help filter the water for the fish. Aquaponics is a powerful way to grow food without relying on the industrial farming methods that strip away resources and harm the environment.

By implementing aquaponics in your own home, you can produce both fresh fish and vegetables with minimal effort and resources. This decentralized method of food production directly challenges the centralized agricultural systems and empowers you to grow your own sustainable sources of protein and nutrition.

# Practical Skills: Reclaiming Your Independence

In a world controlled by corporations and elites, practical skills are one of the most valuable tools you can have. By learning the basics of plumbing and electrical work, you can reduce your reliance on outside services and be more self-sufficient in maintaining your systems. Whether it’s fixing a broken pipe or wiring your rainwater collection system, these skills give you the power to maintain your home and homestead without relying on the corporate service industry that profits from your dependence.

# Now Is the Time to Act

This spring, take the first step toward breaking free from the chains of the elites. You don’t need to wait for the world to change—you can create the change yourself, right now. By growing your own food, raising livestock, collecting water, and learning essential skills, you can reclaim the sovereignty that has been stripped from you over generations.

Every seed you plant, every chicken you raise, and every barrel of rainwater you collect is an act of rebellion against the systems that seek to control your life. This is your opportunity to take back control, to build a life that is independent and free from the corporate and financial systems that have manipulated us for far too long.

Take action today. Your sovereignty is in your hands."

Morgan and Merrill Lynch](https://investorclaims.com/blog/harvest-volatility-management-strategy-iron-condor-merrill-lynch), has been a hot topic lately. Harvest Volatility Management LLC, the asset management firm that applies this strategy, have faced trouble with regulators like the SEC due to improper practices.

## Regulatory Hurdles for Harvest Volatility Management

The **Harvest Volatility Management Strategy** utilizes a complex investment approach known as the ""**Iron Condor**"" that tries to make extra money for investors through selling put and call options. It can work well when markets are calm, but it runs into problems during wild market swings, such as those seen in 2018. Some investors lost a lot of money in 2018 as a result, which led to complaints against **Harvest Volatility Management** and **Merrill Lynch**. This shows how difficult it can be to balance intricate investment plans with the risks involved when markets become unpredictable.

## The Consequences Faced

**Harvest Volatility Management** got into hot water with regulators in September 2024. The **SEC** (a federal agency that regulates Wall Street) charged them for breaking rules regarding how much clients wanted to invest in a program called the **Collateral Yield Enhancement Strategy (CYES)**. Between **Harvest Volatility Management LLC** and **Merrill Lynch**, a **$9.3 million settlement** was paid, showing us the consequences when financial companies don't follow the rules.

As **Harvest Volatility Management** works through these problems, we can learn a lot about how the finance industry is changing. It's a reminder of how crucial it is to have strong systems in place for [brokerage firms to follow the rules](https://investorclaims.com/brokerage-firms/)."

A common farming game trope is the whole ""tired of the corporate office life, move to the country to start a farm."" I'm wondering if there are any games that are the opposite - tired of the boring country life and move to the city to try to make it in a bustling world? Something I feel like is sorta what I'm thinking of is Sneaky Sasquatch on Apple Arcade, about a Sasquatch who leaves the forest to go work. He starts off working deliveries, then in an office and tries to earn money to buy a car, buy clothes, rent an apartment, etc. Just curious if there are other games out there that are more ""city life"" but also still have farming sim components like work to make money, meet people, explore, gather resources in order to improve in life and upgrade your house or belongings."

As Fromsoftware fans we love replaying the games with specific builds that we deeply Theorycrafted for a long time and that's why we need some sort of wiki to collect our items quickly to do the run with our new build. In this mod some items locations are different from the two base games (and others are even new like the heide's set available without farming), so i listed some of them during my playthroughs. Unfortunately it's more melee builds focused items that i picked and registred for the builds i did. But feel free, Young Hollows, to add whatever you want in the comments or to use things from this list if you want to create a wiki or a more complete list. 

Please excuse the sometimes too long formulations, I wrote them quickly during my multiple runs.

I regret if it's maybe not the subreddit for, i wanted to share it in the DS2 sub but i couldn't ( i needed to comment more to up some karma reddit points or something like that to be able to post).

Understanding the Market for Homes with Land for Sale Near Me,u_TheLotStore,1i99x4v,2025-01-24 19:00:35,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/whyrodma61fe1.jpeg,TheLotStore,,"Gaining Insight into the Market for Houses with Plots for Sale Near Me\
Many people find the idea of owning a residence with land very attractive. Whether it's the concept of having more room, the ability to cultivate your own food, or simply reveling in the beauty of nature just outside your doorstep, the notion of owning a house with some acreage appeals to many. If you're in the hunt for houses with land for sale nearby, it's crucial to comprehend the market and what to anticipate. In this piece, we'll delve into the current market for houses with land, qualities to seek in a property, and how to navigate the purchasing process.\
The current market for houses with land for sale is diverse. Several different factors can influence the availability and pricing of these properties. One vital aspect to ponder is location. Houses with land are more common in rural or semi-rural areas, so if you're seeking a property within a city or suburban area, you may have limited choices. Additionally, the size of the land and the kind of property (e.g., a detached house, a farm, a ranch, etc.) will also impact the availability and pricing of these properties.\
Generally, the market for houses with land for sale nearby can be intensely competitive. These properties tend to be in high demand, particularly among purchasers who are seeking a more rural or natural lifestyle. Consequently, it's not unusual for these properties to sell swiftly and for a high price. If you're keen on acquiring a house with land, it's essential to be poised to act promptly and to have a clear insight into what you're seeking in a property.\
Whilst searching for houses with land for sale, it's essential to comprehend the diverse types of available properties. One common type of property is the detached house with a spacious allotment or even several acres of land. These properties can offer ample privacy and space, making them ideal for families or individuals desiring some level of seclusion from neighbors. Other options include farms, ranches, and other categories of agricultural properties. These properties can be an excellent option for anyone interested in farming or livestock, or who simply desires to relish a more rural lifestyle. Additionally, there are also properties tailored for recreational applications, such as hunting or fishing, that may encompass cabins or other structures on the land.\
When seeking houses with land for sale nearby, it's crucial to bear in mind that the scale and type of property you're searching for will impact the pricing. Larger plots of land or properties with supplementary structures (such as barns, outbuildings, etc.) will generally be pricier than smaller properties. Additionally, the location of the property, the quality of the land, and any additional amenities (such as lakes or rivers in proximity) can also impact the price. It's imperative to have a clear perception of your budget and what you're looking for in a property before commencing your search.\
Its also crucial to consider the specific features and amenities that you're seeking in a property. For instance, if you're interested in farming or gardening, you'll want to seek out a property that has fertile soil and access to water. If you're keen on raising livestock, you'll want to look for a property that has suitable fencing and shelter. Furthermore, if you're interested in outdoor recreational pursuits, such as hunting or fishing, you'll want to find a property that grants access to the kinds of terrain and wildlife that you're interested in.\
Once you have a lucid understanding of what you're seeking in a property, it's time to commence browsing the available properties in your vicinity. There are several different ways to unearth houses with land for sale nearby. One option is to engage with a real estate agent who specializes in rural properties. These agents will possess a good insight into the local market and will be able to assist you in finding properties that align with your requirements. Another option is to explore properties online through various real estate websites. These websites often provide sophisticated search features that enable you to search for properties predicated on specific criteria, such as size, location, and price. Finally, you can also drive around the areas you're interested in to look for ""for sale"" signs or contact local landowners directly to inquire about any potential sales.\
Upon discovering a property that piques your interest, it's vital to conduct extensive research on the property before making an offer. This may include procuring a professional inspection to check for any issues with the home or land. It's also important to comprehend any potential use restrictions or zoning regulations that may influence how you can utilize the property. Additionally, you'll want to possess a clear understanding of any potential maintenance or ongoing expenses associated with the property, such as utility costs, property taxes, and any necessary upkeep for the land or structures.\
After pinpointing a property that meets your needs and you've conducted your due diligence, it's time to submit an offer. In a competitive market, it's vital to be positioned to act promptly and to make a robust offer. This may involve having your financing in place and being prepared to make a substantial down payment. It's also important to have a clear understanding of what you're willing to pay for the property and to be prepared to engage in negotiation with the seller. It's not uncommon for these types of properties to sell for above the asking price, so it's important to be adaptable and open to negotiation.\
To summarize, the market for houses with land for sale nearby can be a competitive one. However, with a clear understanding of what you're seeking in a property, a degree of patience and determination, and the support of a knowledgeable real estate agent, it is feasible to discover the perfect property for you. Whether you're seeking a detached house with some acreage or a larger agricultural property, there are abundant options available. By comprehending the market and what to seek in a property, you can turn the dream of owning a residence with land into a reality.\

cube farm v0.9.3 update: 13 new bosses & improved boss rewards!,cubefarm,1i99l3t,2025-01-24 18:44:36,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cubefarm/comments/1i99l3t/cube_farm_v093_update_13_new_bosses_improved_boss/,tarotfocus,new release!,"a new update just released for [cube farm (ios)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cube-farm/id6474876588) and [cube farm (android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tarotfocus.cubefarm)! this update primarily improves the progression grind with bosses. previously there was a large gap in goo earning for players between early game and reaching the point where they could collect elemental goosters. 

the spawn rates of all bosses have been increased and smoothed out across all gooster levels above level 20. additionally, idols can be unlocked earlier by defeating the 4 elemental goosters, and an extra idol slot was added at level 25. this significantly reduces the amount of grinding required to reach the next big milestones of progression with idols and regrowth that multiply rewards and accelerate progression.

there's a handful of other improvements to discover - the highly requested feature of being able to disable the repeated boss reward alerts is finally in-game! cube farm can now be played with a very minimal number of flow-disrupting alerts!

hope you enjoy - update today and let me know what you think of the new version in the comments below!

v0.9.3 changelog:

* added: 13 new bosses!
* added: recipes for crafting boss goosters
* balance: increased boss spawn rates
* balance: rebate for increased boss first win bonuses
* balance: unlock idols after defeating elemental bosses
* balance: new level 25 idol slot
* fixed: mythic gooster reward
* fixed: prevent incorrect elemental gooster combine
* fixed: modal lag reduced
* feedback: toggle for repeat boss reward alerts
* feedback: green arrow when middle layer ready for harvest
* feedback: new stats for active vs passive play"

Influencing industry illustrates how our society is becoming increasingly anti-intellectual and anti-science,NYCinfluencersnark,1i964di,2025-01-24 16:11:14,357,0.99,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCinfluencersnark/comments/1i964di/influencing_industry_illustrates_how_our_society/,Darksecretsonly_04,,"I know this is a little heady and to be clear I’m not talking about the fashion girlies posting OOTDs. Just curious how if others feel similarly:

I think the internet is a wonderful, wonderful thing. If you asked me a few years ago if I thought we were more informed because of it I would say yes. Now I would say no - confused if anything. Our acceptance of political misinformation has trickled down to our acceptance of misinformation about mental and physical health, finances, real estate, parenting etc. 

I see it EVERYWHERE. Why are we so comfortable relying on people with no credentials or expertise? A friend diagnosed herself with PCOS from a PCOS influencer and now adheres to PCOS diets provided by people that aren’t dietitians. People are drinking raw milk because Ballerina Farm drinks raw milk. People listen to medical advice from “Dr” Will Cole…who is NOT a real doctor, because he brushes shoulders with Gwyneth Paltrow. Parents are seeking parenting advice from mommy vloggers who are anti-shoes, toothpaste and education. Why is Mel Robbins a mental health guru when she has absolutely no formal education? And even lower stakes but people actually buy Eli Rallo’s self-help book about relationships when she’s had like one relationship lol. People are also replacing their tv shows and movies with YouTube vlogs. I’m not a film/tv snob, I love trash tv. But the idea that people are increasingly consuming less thought provoking, artistic, analytical, historical content, etc. is becoming glaringly obvious. 

Idk. On one hand, I believe in knowledge coming with experience. I understand that we have a lot of problems in many of our industries and that there are many barriers people face in accessing actual experts. But I’m just over it. This all started when I saw a vibrating plate on Tik Tok. I tried to find actual doctors that supported the benefits of vibrating plates but there were literally hundreds of creators counseling people about the medical benefits. These people have SPINAL INJURIES and are asking a Tik Tok shop influencer if a vibrating plate is Safe? Da fuq???

Self-Harvesting Alveo Vera Farm (with exploits!),Oxygennotincluded,1i94zfm,2025-01-24 15:22:15,21,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxygennotincluded/comments/1i94zfm/selfharvesting_alveo_vera_farm_with_exploits/,Nazgaz,Build,"https://preview.redd.it/5u6mnukdwzee1.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=283e35ae3026c167bb61e922d720c16eea77f129

This is my take on a self-harvesting Alveo vera farm built in survival. Finally a good use for CO2 geysers!

* The farm is 31x17 tiles in size and it is self-harvesting due to the mutation Juicy Fruits
* Its quite easy to find 10 wheezeworts but more difficult to get 60+ juicy fruit mutations. Once I got my hands on one seed, I confess to having used the seed duplication exploit, which is finnicky but doable in survival.
* Using the pip-plant-in-flower-pot exploit, you can plant wheezeworts and alveo vera without fertilization requirements.
* You still need a source of CO2 and 250+ rads/cycle on the lower tile of the plant
* Planting wheezeworts in this pattern (and a few airflow tiles out of uranium ore), give enough rads for the farm.
* The CO2 from the geyser is too cold and requires a little bit of heat to turn gaseous.
* Make sure the CO2 geyser outputs a little more than what the farm consumes. That way the oxylite will eventually stop off-gassing due to overpressure and maximise plant growth uptime.
* Two gas pumps are placed up top to remove unwanted gasses
* Eventually the room will have too much CO2 and will require some to be removed with the gas pumps.
* The new Flydos are great in these situations with limited space! Have a few of them along with a power bank charger and eco power banks in the same room. That way they will help recharge each other.

Hope you enjoy the design!"

We’re happy to remind everyone that the waitlist is officially open for **Wavestock**,  our community investment platform focused on **regenerative aquaculture**! 🐟🌱

**What is Wavestock?**  
Wavestock is a platform to enable a larger amount of people to support and benefit from the growth of sustainable aquaculture.

✅ **Exclusive early access** to initial aquaculture investment projects.

✅ **Higher ROI potential** with our first round of launch projects.

✅ **Direct access** to our team and a voice in helping shape our platform

✅ **Be part of a movement** to restore marine ecosystems and support coastal communities.

**How does it work?**  
1️⃣ You buy in to a share of an aquaculture farm’s revenue or equity.  
2️⃣ With new capital, farms expand, diversify or improve their operations sustainably with your support.  
3️⃣ Your support and advocacy then drives awareness of a farms product, improving demand

4️⃣ When the farms harvest and sell, you earn payouts!



🌟 **Help us build the future of community supported aquaculture.** 🌟

I’m planning to set up a small permaculture farm and am trying to gauge how much daily effort (in hours) is needed for tasks like:

1. De-weeding
2. Irrigation
3. Planting and harvesting

I currently work full-time, but my goal is to transition to part-time remote work and eventually to quit, so I can dedicate more time to building and maintaining the farm. I’m wondering if anyone here has experience balancing part-time work with farm setup.

Also, how much of the workload can be automated or reduced with tools like drip irrigation, mulching, etc.? 
And does the daily effort significantly decrease after the first year, once the systems are in place and soil health improves?

I’d really appreciate any insights or advice from those of you who’ve started farms solo or integrated permaculture practices into your setup.

Thanks so much!


--Edit--


The plan of the farm is to grow food for my own consumption, primarily fruits and vegetables and eventually staples too, without any plans for selling the produce.

 Exploring the Potential of Farmlands for Sale Nearby: A Buyer's Handbook

In case you have ever envisioned owning farmlands, you might have found yourself scouring for ""farmlands for sale nearby"" on different real estate platforms. Whether you aim to reside off the land, initiate your agricultural enterprise, or simply relish the serenity that accompanies rural living, purchasing a farm can offer a profoundly fulfilling journey.

Prior to delving into the realm of farm ownership, it's crucial to comprehend the potential residing in farmlands for sale nearby you and the vital considerations essential for prospective buyers to bear in mind. This handbook will delve into the potential of farmlands for sale near you and furnish you with the knowledge required to make a well-informed decision.

Grasping the Potential of Farmlands for Sale Nearby

When it involves the acquisition of a farm, several facets necessitate careful consideration. From the dimensions and location of the property to its agricultural potential and infrastructure, numerous elements can exert a substantial influence on your experience as a farm owner. Here are some of the fundamental aspects to contemplate when exploring the potential of farmlands for sale nearby:

1. Location
The location of a farm stands as one of the most pivotal factors for contemplation. Not only does it exert an impact on the climate and topography of the land but also influences accessibility to markets, the availability of resources, and the local agricultural community. When on the lookout for farmlands for sale near you, factor in the proximity to major roads, towns, and cities, along with the overall desirability of the location for agricultural activities.

2. Dimensions and Type of Farm
Farmlands come in a multitude of configurations and sizes, ranging from small hobby farms to extensive commercial operations. The type of farm you decide to purchase will hinge on your aspirations and resources. Mull over the size of the property, the kind of agriculture it can sustain (e.g., livestock, crops, or both), and any existing infrastructure that might bear relevance to your plans.

3. Soil Quality and Water Rights
The quality of the soil and the availability of water stand as crucial determinants in assessing the agricultural potential of a farm. Before making a purchase, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the soil type, its fertility, and any potential limitations it might pose. Furthermore, inquire about water rights, irrigation systems, and any water sources on the property, as these can exert a significant influence on the farm's productivity.

4. Pre-existing Infrastructure
Irrespective of whether you seek to commence a new farm or take charge of an existing operation, the extant infrastructure of a property can substantively influence its potential. Hunt for farmlands with pre-existing edifices, barns, enclosures, and other structures that can economize your time and resources in the long term. Additionally, contemplate the availability of utilities, such as electricity and water, and the condition of any existing equipment.

5. Zoning and Regulations
Prior to purchasing a farm, it is indispensable to comprehend the local zoning regulations and any agricultural or environmental constraints that might be applicable to the property. These regulations can impact the kinds of activities you can engage in on the farm, as well as any potential future developments.

Pivotal Considerations for Prospective Buyers

Apart from fathoming the potential of farmlands for sale nearby you, there exist several pivotal considerations that prospective buyers should bear in mind. These encompass financial aspects, legal considerations, and the lifestyle adjustments accompanying farm ownership. Here are some vital factors to deliberate prior to committing to a purchase:

1. Financing and Budgetary Planning
Procuring a farm represents a substantial financial decision, and it is critical to meticulously plan your budget and financing alternatives. In addition to the purchase price, factor in the expenses for maintenance, equipment, and any prospective renovations or enhancements. Delve into diverse financing choices, such as agricultural loans, to ascertain the optimal approach for funding your farm acquisition.

2. Legal and Regulatory Considerations
Steering through the legal and regulatory facets of farm ownership can prove to be intricate. It is imperative to collaborate with a real estate agent or attorney who possesses experience in agricultural transactions and can navigate you through the process. This encompasses comprehending any pre-existing easements, property rights, and any pertinent local regulations that may have a bearing on the farm.

3. Lifestyle and Devotion
Owning a farm demands a substantial lifestyle adjustment. From the physical demands of agriculture to the protracted hours and seasonal labor, it is important to ponder whether farm ownership aligns with your lifestyle and long-term objectives. Furthermore, contemplate the impact on your family, along with any learning or experiential gaps you may need to bridge to competently manage a farm.

4. Market and Industry Trends
Preceding the acquisition of a farm, it can prove advantageous to research contemporaneous market and industry trends. Consider aspects such as the supply and demand for agricultural products, the local market for your chosen crops or livestock, and any prospective alterations in consumer inclinations or legislation that might impact your farm's future prospects.

Pointers for Locating Farmlands for Sale Nearby

Now that you possess a more profound understanding of the potential and pivotal considerations for purchasing a farm, it is time to embark on your quest for the perfect property. Here are some pointers for uncovering farmlands for sale near you:

1. Collaborate with a Real Estate Agent with Agricultural Proficiency
Accomplishing the quest for the right farm can be an involved process, and enlisting the services of a real estate agent with expertise in agricultural transactions can notably streamline the search. Seek out an agent who comprehends the distinctive requisites of farm buyers, in addition to the local agricultural community and market trends.

2. Leverage Online Farm Listings and Marketplaces
In conjunction with working alongside a real estate agent, contemplate employing online farm listings and marketplaces to scout for properties. Websites such as FarmFlip, Land And Farm, and Zillow can furnish a broad spectrum of farm listings, enabling you to peruse diverse options and compare properties based on your specifications.

3. Participate in Agricultural Events and Networking Platforms
Participating in agricultural events, farm excursions, and networking platforms can yield invaluable insights into the local farming community and potential prospects for procuring a farm. Furthermore, forging connections with other farmers, agricultural organizations, and industry professionals can aid in uncovering off-market properties and garnering valuable advice from seasoned individuals.

4. Contemplate Off-Market Opportunities
In certain instances, the ideal farm may not be publicly listed for sale. Deliberate reaching out to local landowners, farmers, and agricultural organizations to probe about potential off-market opportunities. This can constitute an excellent avenue for exploring properties that may not have been publicly listed or discovering owners open to selling in the near future.

Concluding Remarks

Acquiring a farm can represent a profoundly fulfilling journey, offering the prospect to reside off the land, initiate a new enterprise, and embrace the agricultural way of life. By comprehending the potential of farmlands for sale nearby, contemplating crucial factors, and leveraging the appropriate resources, you can pinpoint the ideal property to materialize your agricultural ambitions. Whether you are a fledgling farm buyer or a seasoned agriculturalist, the expedition toward farm ownership constitutes an exhilarating and momentous pursuit capable of reshaping your life and future.

So i can get into that if you want but I'm just going to keep this at a high level

Trump wants universal tarrifs at 10-25% across the board. He said very clearly that he wants to kick this off on February 1st. Which Mexico and Canada already responded with threats of a trade war in response 

Trump's mass deportation policies will result in the price of groceries increasing. We saw this happen in Florida when immigrant farm workers were deported. There's just no world where US employees will be cheaper. So we will be footing the bill for that.

Not to mention the tax revenue, and the amount of money taken out of our economy that will be lost from his efforts to deport 11 million immigrants. 

He ran on the platform that he'll put more money in your wallet, and reduce the price of groceries... But so far all of his policies can and will directly make everything more expensive for us. Are you concerned about your finances or do conservatives have a different view of all of this?"

why is it so shameful to do a non-office job?,findapath,1i8zslh,2025-01-24 11:46:10,267,0.91,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1i8zslh/why_is_it_so_shameful_to_do_a_nonoffice_job/,Cheap-Challenge8746,Findapath-Mindset Adjustment,"My family has always been poor. My mother hasn't worked since her youth and my father owns a failing business. I tried to get out by going to college, getting a degree, and financing it all on my own. Now I'm in my mid-20's and feeling LOST. 

It seems like all the ""grown-up"" jobs are based on showing face, sitting at a desk, and doing a whole lot of nothing. I'm a farm kid at heart who's lost the stamina for working in the heat, so I fill that space with part-time customer service jobs. Sharing this information is typically met with ""you'll find something [better] eventually!""

I enjoy doing repetitive tasks. I enjoy seeing immediate impact on real people every day. I tried working in an office and withered away under the fluorescent lights. Where is the balance? Why are people so judgemental towards this type of life?"
COSMOS AIRDROP UPDATE,cosmosnetwork,1i8yvtg,2025-01-24 11:07:54,14,0.89,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1i8yvtg/cosmos_airdrop_update/,AtlasStaking,,"https://preview.redd.it/q6lcek55pyee1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9c183f91dc9e7d1bcda21b46c3ad88ff85a15c7

I (Matt) am one of the founders of Blocks United and have been keeping track of airdrops for you for several years. I have split my time between Blocks United and Atlas Staking for quite awhile. After 3 great years, I've decided to move on from Blocks United and to focus on growing validators with Atlas Staking. 

I am an airdrop hunter myself, so I will continue to post these valuable updates. I don't want you to miss big free money... airdrops like Injective and Celestia that made people thousands of dollars. 

Atlas Staking is worth keeping an eye on because we are expanding rapidly. We currently run validators for Cosmos (inactive), Kava, Nomic, Band, Babylon, Stride, Seda, ETH/Stader, Radix, Avalanche, Avail, and Polygon. If you stake any of those tokens, please give Atlas Staking your consideration.

Going forward, please be aware that the airdrop updates will come from Atlas Staking, NOT Blocks United. I promise the same great resource with regular airdrop updates. 

**To access airdrop claim links please register for our** [Cosmos Airdrop Email](https://airdrops.atlas-staking.com/cosmos?utm_source=ardupt1-24-25&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=cosmosairdrops)**. If you don’t see the email within a minute, check your spam folder.**

**We don't paste the links in this post because Reddit's spam filter will flag and remove the post. Airdrop claim links cause instant removal by Reddit. They are trying to protect users from scammers.**

You must use a Cosmos-native wallet, like [Keplr](https://www.atlas-staking.com/stake-atom-using-keplr/) or [Leap](https://www.atlas-staking.com/stake-atom-using-leap/), or [Cosmostation](https://www.atlas-staking.com/stake-atom-using-cosmostation/) to claim airdrops and manage those tokens. 

We do our best to verify that all the information in this email is official and safe to click, but we can’t possibly know if a project turns out to be a scam. We are not smart contract or authz permission auditors, nor do we hold ourselves out to be.

**When claiming airdrops you will be prompted to “approve” the transaction. Be on the lookout for, “msgSend” and other authz permissions. Those are BAD. If you see anything other than “msgClaim” then we advise against approving the transaction. It’s best to wait and check social media channels to see if people are getting scammed.**

You can find Atlas Staking in Keplr**,** Cosmostation**,** Leap wallet**,** Trust wallet, Ledger Live, Frontier, Rainbow and Guarda wallets.

I have met the Oracle of New Drexel,ChrisEtherWrites,1i8yn7u,2025-01-24 10:58:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisEtherWrites/comments/1i8yn7u/i_have_met_the_oracle_of_new_drexel/,IAmChristopherEther,,"I can’t stop thinking about the Oracle. The memory of that day has corrupted my every thought. On good days, I might be able to stop thinking long enough to eat or change clothes before the anxiety cripples me back into submission. Today is not a good day. A lot of days are not good days. So, if these are the thoughts I’m stuck with, then they’re the ones I’ll write.

I had just moved away to start college. My mind was filled with ‘what ifs’. What if I get lost on campus? What if I don’t like my classes? What if I can’t make friends? But, after a couple of weeks, my nerves subsided as I got settled into my new routine. It was a sleepy little college town, surrounded by a sea of yellow corn fields and family farms. The people were nice enough and, on the surface, I had nothing to complain about. Until a couple weeks in when I noticed the whispering.  

Initially, I wrote it off. I assumed it was just people whispering about me being new to the area and that as the semester went on I’d become more than just the new girl. But it didn’t stop. Even well into my first semester people who I thought of as friends, or at least classmates, still whispered to each other whenever I was around. I know what they kept whispering now. From the day I arrived the question on everyone’s lips was “Has she met the Oracle?”.

I first learned of her from a note that was snuck into my backpack. It was a yellow index card that said “The Oracle would like to see your future.” It listed a New Drexel address, a time and date, and then said “Bring an offering”. I thought it was some weird small-town joke.

After I had found the note, the whisperers turned their questions to me. I couldn’t walk into a room without at least one person seeing me, briskly walking over, and then whispering in my ear excitedly “Have you gone yet?” or “Have you met her?”.

They were so eager to talk about her. One told me that he got winning lottery numbers from her. Another left his day job to start his own company, because she saw it in his future. Another met her now husband because of the Oracle. All success stories. All happy endings.

I was skeptical. It was all so weird. I told myself I wouldn’t go, but whether it came from curiosity or boredom, one Friday night, I found myself taking endless lefts and rights through the backroads lined with cornfields. In my passenger seat I had the now worn-out index card with the address and a brand-new family size package of Oreos. No one would tell me what kind of offering an Oracle would want, but who doesn’t like Oreos?

 

I’m not sure what I expected but it wasn’t what I found. Pulling up to the address I took a long dirt path surrounded by trees that gave way to a large clearing where two double wide trailer homes sat, private and hidden. The yard was a mess of old and new. An old plastic slide and play house were faded from years out in the elements. Yet next to them was a brand-new playground structure made of beautiful dark wood. The green plastic slide looked shiny and inviting, and the swings were pristine with their chains clanging softly in the breeze. I turned my attention to the houses. Between them was an awning in which two cars sat parked, a beat-up Jeep Wrangler, and a sporty looking BMW.

Before I noticed her, she was in front of me, holding out a hand to shake. She was a younger girl. We must have been around the same age.  She wore a dirty work shirt and stained overalls. Brown hair lied braided behind her back. Brown eyes looked up at me expectantly, waiting for me to shake her hand. I was about to explain myself, and tell her that I was looking for the Oracle but she cut me off before I could open my mouth.

“Hi Elise. I’m Alex. But you’ve probably heard of me as ‘The Oracle’. Nice to finally meet you.”

Wordlessly, I shook her hand.

“Come inside, you can sit on the couch while I freshen up. We’ll be in the left house” she said, and without any further discussion, she turned and began walking away. I followed her, but before I got to the door, she turned and said,

“Don’t forget the Oreos, Double Stuf is my favorite.”

 

When I walked in, I was greeted by a small cozy home. To the left was the kitchen and to the right was a small dining room table, old and worn, with beat up chairs to match. Walking past the table I found the living room, furnished with luxury couches that were almost too big to fit the space. I sat and was faced with a large television that was nearly the size of the wall it hung on. I heard the shower running. It acted as brown noise, as my mind began to wander. I thought about how strange it all was. Some girl living all the way out here can see the future? I didn’t believe her. Not at first. Even though she knew my name, I explained that away. I assumed one of the whisperers had told her. I hadn’t told anyone about the Oreos, but eventually I figured that she had seen them in the passenger seat of my car.

A loud tearing noise pulled me from my thoughts. I realized she was in the kitchen now, opening up the package of cookies. The shower was off. I don’t know how long it had been off, but it was off. She was dressed in a different outfit of t-shirt and overalls, cleaner, but still stained with dirt and car grease. Her hair was dry.

“So …” I began. But I wasn’t sure what to say. I remember being thankful that she cut me off again.

“Hey! Sorry to leave you sitting there. I knew you would be here sometime, but I didn’t know when.”

“How did you know I would come here at all?”  
“I saw it”, she said, simply.

The words hung in the air for a beat. Then another.

“You have questions, I’m sure. They always do. Would you sit with me? I can explain what I know.” she said, motioning to the beat-up dining table.

I remember I was unsure about whether I should sit down. I had thought about just leaving. That this was just some scam. But then I blinked, and I was sat facing her.  A large candle sat between us with a lid on top. She was speaking about something and must have been deep in thought. Her eyes didn’t meet mine as she continued on.

“- like I said, I don’t get to control what I see or how far. Without anyone, I only get dreams. Fragments of thousands of futures that I can rarely make sense of. But when I have someone else here, I can see into the future through them. That’s why I love new guests. Now, the visions are a sure thing. Fate or destiny or whatever you want to call it, its fixed, it’s just yet to be lived.”

She paused for a moment. Then made eye contact with me again.

“Sorry if I was rambling. Does that answer your question?”

“I’m not sure.” Was all I could say.

“You might be feeling a little disoriented, but that’s normal. It’s this property. The land has something about it. Feels like you’re in a fog sometimes. Can I get you some water or anything?”

I remember this moment. It fills me with regret. Anger. Resentment. I didn’t know when she started talking or how much I missed but I was sure that something was wrong. I didn’t remember sitting down. I didn’t remember asking her a question. I felt high. I felt so far from anything real, sitting at that shitty table. And I meant to tell her. I meant to say that I felt ill. That I had cold feet. That I needed to leave. I opened my mouth. The words started.

“I- “

And then the blinds were closed, and the room was dark. The candle flickered as our only light. We held hands above the table together like a séance. She was telling me to look deeply into her eyes and only into her eyes. We both sat leaning forward, she stared into my eyes and I stared into hers. The candlelight flickered. She bore into me with intensity. Her brown eyes looked darker in the candle light. I was waiting. Waiting. My lungs burned and I realized I had been holding my breath. I exhaled and waited. Another moment passed. Then, the room began to glow.

It was soft at first. An orange light that draped gently over the room. I looked around for the source. To my surprise, the candlelight was merely a whisper, and the blinds were still drawn.

“Look at me. I can’t see unless you look into my eyes.” The Oracle reprimanded.

I looked back at her, and her eyes emanated a faint orange light.

“Look deeper” she instructed.

I obeyed.

Her irises had changed from a common brown into something more. The orange became brighter. Warmer. I heard birds singing. I felt the wind blowing. Everything was calm. Serene. Her eyes were an early summer morning. They turned a shade of green and I heard the leaves rustling in the breeze. It was all brighter now. Hotter. She stared at me, with suns for eyes. I strained to keep my eyes open, but I felt compelled to look harder. I saw the clear blue sky of a summer’s day and then that blue gave way to purples and pinks as I watched the sun set. The night came, and her eyes twinkled with starlight. We were bathed in the light of a harvest moon. I watched the stars turn until the room began to glow orange again.

Days passed in those eyes. Then weeks. And then months. I stared into those kaleidoscope eyes and I watched the seasons pass. The colors danced around the room, gaining speed.  I watched the storms gather. Dark foreboding grays that swirled with intensity and power. Lightning flashed in her sockets, and I smelt the rain. I was enamored when she reached the autumn months. The room shone brilliant shades of brown, yellow, and red, and we were buried in the falling leaves. I was lost in the flashing lights of a life I’ve yet to live.

Until suddenly, it stopped.

I found myself at the beat-up dining room table again. I was holding the hands of a stranger with a faint candle lit between us. We were both standing out of our chairs and leaning forward to see each other better. She looked into my eyes and I looked into hers. Her eyes were plain, and brown, and gripped with fear.

“Well, what did you see?” I ventured to ask.

My question seemed to pull her back into the moment with me. She threw my hands down, as if she were surprised to still be holding them and began to back away from me into the wall. The Oracle held her hands to her eyes, covering her face. From behind her hands, I heard a pleading whisper.

“No, no, no, no, no”.

“What did you see?” was all I could ask.

She slammed her hands on the table and began to scream.

“NO, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO!”

There were tears in her eyes. Without warning she had exploded into hysterics. I was frozen. Stunned. Too stunned in that moment to stop her as she took her first two fingers on each hand, and began to gouge out her own eyes, all the while still screaming “NO! NO! NO!”.

She fell to the ground, screaming in defiance. What was left of her eyes hung out of her sockets and blood stained her face, her clothes, and especially her hands. She was sobbing. I began to approach her. I wanted to help her. I wanted to take her to a hospital. And selfishly, somewhere deep down, I needed to know what she saw. But I never got the chance.

A harsh Yellow light burst from her now empty eye sockets. It hummed with intensity and poured over me like a nuclear blast. The oracle sprung to her feet and screamed out in horror,

“OH GOD, I CAN STILL SEE IT!”.

Without another word she grabbed the table firmly with both hands and bashed her head against it. Everything around me drowned in the light. Explosions of Yellow rattled me with each impact.  She screamed and slammed her head again. My skin burned. Slam. My teeth ached with every sickening hit. Slam. Something cracked loudly. My eyes failed me. I saw only Yellow. All-encompassing Yellow. She screamed out again, a cry of terror, and with a final slam, the light was gone as quickly as it came.

The Oracle lied dead, an eyeless mess of fear and gore.

In every sunrise, in every storm, in every clear sky, I see her ever changing eyes watching me. At night, when everything is still, I hear my heartbeat, pounding away like a skull cracking against wood. And when sleep does finally take me, I see the Yellow, whispering to me about impossible things that are yet to be[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisEtherWrites/comments/1i8xuj9/thank\_you\_for\_reading/)"

I looked back at her, and her eyes emanated a faint orange light.

“Look deeper” she instructed.

I obeyed.

Her irises had changed from a common brown into something more. The orange became brighter. Warmer. I heard birds singing. I felt the wind blowing. Everything was calm. Serene. Her eyes were an early summer morning. They turned a shade of green and I heard the leaves rustling in the breeze. It was all brighter now. Hotter. She stared at me, with suns for eyes. I strained to keep my eyes open, but I felt compelled to look harder. I saw the clear blue sky of a summer’s day and then that blue gave way to purples and pinks as I watched the sun set. The night came, and her eyes twinkled with starlight. We were bathed in the light of a harvest moon. I watched the stars turn until the room began to glow orange again.

Days passed in those eyes. Then weeks. And then months. I stared into those kaleidoscope eyes and I watched the seasons pass. The colors danced around the room, gaining speed.  I watched the storms gather. Dark foreboding grays that swirled with intensity and power. Lightning flashed in her sockets, and I smelt the rain. I was enamored when she reached the autumn months. The room shone brilliant shades of brown, yellow, and red, and we were buried in the falling leaves. I was lost in the flashing lights of a life I’ve yet to live.

Until suddenly, it stopped.

I found myself at the beat-up dining room table again. I was holding the hands of a stranger with a faint candle lit between us. We were both standing out of our chairs and leaning forward to see each other better. She looked into my eyes and I looked into hers. Her eyes were plain, and brown, and gripped with fear.

“Well, what did you see?” I ventured to ask.

My question seemed to pull her back into the moment with me. She threw my hands down, as if she were surprised to still be holding them and began to back away from me into the wall. The Oracle held her hands to her eyes, covering her face. From behind her hands, I heard a pleading whisper.

“No, no, no, no, no”.

“What did you see?” was all I could ask.

She slammed her hands on the table and began to scream.

“NO, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO!”

There were tears in her eyes. Without warning she had exploded into hysterics. I was frozen. Stunned. Too stunned in that moment to stop her as she took her first two fingers on each hand, and began to gouge out her own eyes, all the while still screaming “NO! NO! NO!”.

She fell to the ground, screaming in defiance. What was left of her eyes hung out of her sockets and blood stained her face, her clothes, and especially her hands. She was sobbing. I began to approach her. I wanted to help her. I wanted to take her to a hospital. And selfishly, somewhere deep down, I needed to know what she saw. But I never got the chance.

A harsh Yellow light burst from her now empty eye sockets. It hummed with intensity and poured over me like a nuclear blast. The oracle sprung to her feet and screamed out in horror,

“OH GOD, I CAN STILL SEE IT!”.

Without another word she grabbed the table firmly with both hands and bashed her head against it. Everything around me drowned in the light. Explosions of Yellow rattled me with each impact.  She screamed and slammed her head again. My skin burned. Slam. My teeth ached with every sickening hit. Slam. Something cracked loudly. My eyes failed me. I saw only Yellow. All-encompassing Yellow. She screamed out again, a cry of terror, and with a final slam, the light was gone as quickly as it came.

The Oracle lied dead, an eyeless mess of fear and gore.

In every sunrise, in every storm, in every clear sky, I see her ever changing eyes watching me. At night, when everything is still, I hear my heartbeat, pounding away like a skull cracking against wood. And when sleep does finally take me, I see the Yellow, whispering to me about impossible things that are yet to be[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisEtherWrites/comments/1i8xuj9/thank\_you\_for\_reading/)"

Plus illegal immigrant farmers that were basically slaves recently got deported or quit. Those two factors won't raise food prices at all.(Sarcasm). I don't have sources because I'm in central FL and am experiencing the cold, and I read something in the last few days about the farming operations basically stopping because of the immigration thing from Desantis/Trump which isn't suprising.

The Hunt for Affordable Land: Finding the Cheapest Acres for Sale,u_TheLotStore,1i8u6no,2025-01-24 07:24:28,1,1.0,1,https://i.redd.it/wb2bq4l3qxee1.jpeg,TheLotStore,,"The Hunt for Affordable Land: Finding the Cheapest Acres for Sale 

 The Expedition for Cost-Effective Land: Discovering the Best Deals on AcreageFor numerous individuals, possessing land is an aspiration that appears unattainable due to excessive prices and minimal availability. However, by acquiring the appropriate knowledge and conducting research, it is feasible to find reasonably priced land for sale. Whether you're seeking to construct your own residence, commence a farm, or invest in real estate, there are choices accessible that won't deplete your finances. In this piece, we will investigate some tactics for discovering the most economical acres for sale and offer recommendations on how to make an astute investment in economical land.Comprehending the Aspects that Influence Land PricesPrior to delving into the pursuit for economical land, it's vital to grasp the factors that influence land prices. Location is one of the most substantial determinants of land worth, with proximity to urban centers, natural advantages, and economic prospects bolstering prices. Additionally, zoning regulations, soil quality, and access to infrastructure such as roads and utilities can impact land value. By acquainting yourself with these aspects, you can pinpoint opportunities to find low-cost land that still fulfills your requirements.Exploring Remote Areas and Undeveloped TerritoryOne of the prime methods to locate affordable land is to explore remote areas and undeveloped territory. In these regions, land prices are generally lower due to a lack of conveniences and services, as well as reduced demand from buyers. Furthermore, undeveloped land may necessitate additional expenses for adding infrastructure and constructing establishments. Nonetheless, if you're ready to invest the effort, you can find extensive acres of land at a fraction of the cost of urban or suburban properties.When exploring remote locations, it's critical to contemplate the potential for future expansion and economic advancement. Some areas may be undergoing an influx of investment and population growth, resulting in escalating land prices. Conversely, other areas may be grappling with economic challenges, furnishing opportunities for budget-friendly land acquisitions. By scrutinizing local economic patterns and development blueprints, you can identify encouraging locations for economical land procurement.Utilizing Online Land Marketplaces and AuctionsIn the current digital era, there are abundant online marketplaces and auctions where you can discover cost-effective land for sale. Websites such as LandWatch, Land And Farm, and Realtor.com provide extensive listings of land for sale, encompassing rural, undeveloped, and even foreclosed properties. These platforms enable you to explore land based on location, price, and specific attributes, simplifying the process of narrowing down your choices and discovering the finest bargains.Auctions can also be an excellent method to unveil economical land prospects. Many properties are auctioned off due to foreclosure, unpaid taxes, or insolvency, resulting in considerably lower prices than conventional sales. Nevertheless, it's critical to thoroughly investigate the property and its potential issues before engaging in an auction to avert unforeseen complications.Collaborating with Local Real Estate Agents and Land BrokersLocal real estate agents and land brokers can be invaluable allies in the quest for economical land. These professionals possess thorough knowledge of the local market and can furnish guidance on locating cost-effective properties. Additionally, they may have access to off-market listings and exclusive deals that aren't publicly advertised.When collaborating with a real estate agent or land broker, it's imperative to articulate your budget and specific requirements clearly. By comprehending your needs and objectives, they can tailor their search and pinpoint properties that match your criteria. Furthermore, they can aid in negotiations and navigating the purchase process, ensuring a seamless and successful transaction.Exploring Government-Owned or Subsidized Land ProgramsIn certain instances, government-owned or subsidized land programs offer opportunities to procure affordable land. These programs are designed to bolster various initiatives, such as agricultural development, conservation, and affordable housing. By delving into these programs, you can uncover opportunities to acquire land at reduced prices or with favorable financing options.For instance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides an array of programs for purchasing and developing rural land, encompassing loans and grants for agricultural projects. Additionally, state and local governments may administer land trust programs and incentives for affordable housing development, providing access to inexpensive land for eligible purchasers. By researching and contacting pertinent government agencies, you can learn about available programs and eligibility criteria.Negotiating with Motivated SellersYet another effective strategy for locating economical land is to engage in negotiations with motivated sellers. Numerous landowners may be eager to sell their properties due to financial constraints, evolving life circumstances, or a preference for a swift sale. By presenting a reasonable offer to these sellers, you can potentially secure a deal below the asking price.Networking within your local community and real estate circles can aid in identifying motivated sellers who are open to negotiation. For example, participating in local real estate events, joining networking groups, and connecting with other land investors can yield valuable leads on potential transactions. Moreover, reaching out to property owners directly and expressing your interest in purchasing their land can unveil opportunities for negotiation.Assessing the Potential for Land Development and UtilizationUltimately, the value of land hinges on its potential for development and utilization. When seeking economical land, it's imperative to evaluate its suitability for your intended purpose and its potential for appreciation in value. For instance, if you're contemplating constructing a residence, you'll need to contemplate the availability of utilities, access to amenities, and building regulations. Similarly, if you're intrigued by agricultural land, you'll need to evaluate soil quality, water resources, and productivity potential.Furthermore, contemplating broader economic and demographic trends can aid in identifying land with substantial growth potential. For example, areas experiencing population growth, infrastructure investment, and economic development may offer prospects for land appreciation and future returns on investment. By conducting comprehensive due diligence and seeking professional counsel, you can make informed decisions about purchasing economical land with enduring potential.Navigating Legal and Financial ConsiderationsWhen procuring cost-effective land, it's indispensable to navigate the legal and financial considerations entailed. This encompasses conducting title searches, obtaining land surveys, and comprehending zoning regulations and land use constraints. Additionally, financing options for land acquisitions may deviate from traditional home mortgages, necessitating specialized lenders or alternative financing solutions.Engaging the services of a real estate attorney and financial advisor can aid in navigating these considerations and ensuring a transparent and secure transaction. These professionals can provide counsel on legal requirements, financing options, and risk management, facilitating informed decisions and averting potential pitfalls.ConclusionLocating affordable land for sale necessitates a blend of research, strategy, and proactive involvement in the market. By exploring remote areas, capitalizing on online resources, collaborating with local professionals, and contemplating government programs, you can unearth opportunities to purchase land at reasonable prices. Furthermore, engaging in negotiations with motivated sellers and assessing the potential for land development can reveal additional avenues for affordable land acquisition.As with any real estate investment, it's imperative to conduct comprehensive due diligence, seek professional advice, and meticulously contemplate your long-term objectives. By approaching the pursuit of affordable land with patience, diligence, and a clear comprehension of the market, you can locate the most economical acres for sale and transform your land ownership dreams into a reality.

Pentapod cold storage + agricultural tower control circuitry,factorio,1i8sy0f,2025-01-24 06:03:40,9,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1i8sy0f/pentapod_cold_storage_agricultural_tower_control/,Potential-Carob-3058,Space Age,"The topic of Pentapod cold storage came up, and someone asked for a blueprint. When finding my build, i realized I used the same circuits to control agricultural tower production. So, here I am sharing.

This is pentapod cold storage in 1 biochamber, 1 decider combinator and 6 inserters. I have found it highly reliable.

[I apologies from the lack of concrete, this is from what was essentially my starter Gleba base,](https://preview.redd.it/z4bo22e14xee1.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=4112cd0e342956280400b07ebbbee53dc63841ad)

The order of events are,

\- Biochamber finishes pentapod craft, making 2 or 3 eggs into the blue inserter on the left. The inserters daisy chain into the chest, but the first one sends the 'Pentapod Egg' signal into the Decider combinator.

\- The decider combinator is a timer, is triggered by the Pentapod Egg signal, and counts up to 13.5 minutes.

\- At 13.5 minutes it resets to 0, allowing the blue inserter to work, which picks up 1 Pentapod Egg and puts it back into the biochamber. This inserter is set to hand size 1, enable (Pentapod Egg =0) And read contents (hold)

\- When this inserter detects the Pentapod Egg signal, it triggers the Stack inserter (enable when Pentapod Egg >0) to pick up any leftover eggs in the box and put them on the red belt to the furnace.

\- Biochamber crafts new pentapod eggs (the red inserters grab Nutrients, and only work when the pentapod egg signal from the timer is 0), repeating the process.

I've found it highly reliable, although it does consume nutrients. Circuit controlling the nutrient inserter helps, this could be refined by reading the biochambers contents and  another combinator to improve nutrient efficiency. Recycling Bio chambers is probably easier and doesn't require nutrients, but this this is available without Fulgoratech.

[Timer programming](https://preview.redd.it/a46bptik5xee1.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba402a3d525787214de33a673194fc7aa1da47c3)

This timer programming has been very handy, as it clicks back to zero at 45000 tics, but will sit at zero and won't start again until it gets a signal. It's a triggered timer, since making it I've used it in a bunch of applications, particularly as a 'Lockout'. Here's the best one.

I used this same logic in controlling agricultural towers. I use flow-through designs on Gleba, triggering the towers when the fruit/nut belt was below a threshold wasn't working great, so I implemented this instead.

[Ignore the red wire disappearing to the left, it's irrelevant here.](https://preview.redd.it/sqqthbc36xee1.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fc012ec5be232f6a4c412404f204a0e17bbae02)

Similar effect. When the tower produces fruit the green inserter picks them up and puts them onto the belt, sending the fruit signal to the first combinator -  Anything >1, output T(1)

The T=1 signal triggers the timer, counting up the T signal for 900 tics, or 15 seconds.

The tower is disabled for 90 tics after it ejects a fruit, (this seems to be enough to allow it to replant, determined experimentally) until the timer counts to the upper limit and resets. Then, the tower can move, harvest, and when it harvest, locks itself out again.

Realistically an agricultural tower can farm 47 tiles (7x7, -1 for the tower, and -1 for inserters and belts). All of this fits into the 3x3 farm tile, along with a powerpole, and seed requester chest. It takes 18000 tics (5 minutes) for a tree to grow, so replacing the 900 with 382 tics (give it a few less to allow for tower movement) will have it running at full capacity. 

This can be used to allow tower that is only farming a few tiles to balance their production over the 5 minute cycle, rather than harvesting and planting all in a wave. If you're only farming 10 tiles, set it to a bit under 1800 to balance out the production of those 10 tiles over time, rather than a few minutes of productions, followed by a of no production.

There are 2 other benefits to this system. 

1) less tower activity = less spores and less pentapods. This is probably marginal, as the act of harvesting (or maybe growing) triggers the tree to release most of the spores. It greatly helps if it reduces wastage though.

2) If you replace the constant (900) with a signal, and can dynamically adjust that signal, you have the effector for a *dynamic, upstream, Gleba control system*. Actually making this control system work one day (well, making it work well, I've already made it work badly) is firmly on my to-do list.

When Dosh released his Space Age video and he lamented not having a Gleba harvest control system, I had a bit of a laugh, as I already had this working.
