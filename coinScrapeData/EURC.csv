# Bitpanda Fusion vs. Coinbase Pro (Advanced Trading)

Una distinzione importante nel mondo crypto riguarda la modalità di operare:

* **Broker:** Piattaforme come [eToro](https://www.criptomania.it/broker/etoro/etoro-criptovalute/) e [Bitpanda](https://www.criptomania.it/exchange/bitpanda/bitpanda-recensione/) propongono prezzi fissi o spread predefiniti e un’interfaccia user-friendly, ideale per i meno esperti.
* **Exchange:** Colleghiano direttamente venditori e compratori, con quotazioni che variano in base a domanda e offerta. Esempi noti includono [Bybit](https://www.criptomania.it/exchange/bybit/bybit-app/), [Binance](https://www.criptomania.it/exchange/binance/binance-app/) e [Coinbase One](https://www.criptomania.it/exchange/coinbase/coinbase-one-premium/).

AMINA Bank removes custody fees for USDC and EURC,u_CoinsHome,1i5euil,2025-01-19 20:31:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CoinsHome/comments/1i5euil/amina_bank_removes_custody_fees_for_usdc_and_eurc/,CoinsHome,,"AMINA Bank Eliminates Custody Fees for USDC and EURC A New Era for Stablecoin Holders

In a significant move to enhance the adoption and use of stablecoins, AMINA Bank, a crypto-friendly bank based in Zug, Switzerland, has announced the elimination of custody fees for clients holding USDC (USD Coin) and plans to extend this benefit to EURC (Euro Coin) holders soon. 😊

What are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a traditional currency. For example, USDC is pegged to the US dollar, and EURC is pegged to the euro. This stability makes them useful for digital payments, remittances, and as a safe store of value in the volatile cryptocurrency market. 💱

What is Custody Fee?

A custody fee is a charge levied by financial institutions for holding and managing clients' assets. In the context of cryptocurrencies, these fees can be substantial and are typically applied to the assets stored in hot and cold wallets. 💰

AMINA Bank's New Offering

AMINA Bank has removed these custody fees for its Stablecoin Rewards Account, allowing clients to hold USDC without incurring the usual banking fees. Here’s what this means for clients:

Key Benefits

Quarterly Rewards

Clients holding USDC in the Stablecoin Rewards Account will receive quarterly rewards, similar to the interest earned on traditional fiat currency deposits but without the associated banking costs. 🤑

Asset Security

AMINA Bank ensures that the stablecoins held in these accounts are not lent out, moved, or reinvested. This guarantees that the assets remain safe from counterparty risks. The stablecoins are stored in segregated wallets, off the balance sheet, protecting them from the bank’s liabilities. 🔒

Flexible Access and Security

Clients can store their USDC holdings in both hot and cold wallets, providing flexible access and industry-leading security. Hot wallets allow for quick transactions, while cold wallets provide an additional layer of security against cyber threats. 🛡️

Expansion to EURC

AMINA Bank also plans to extend this fee-free custody service to EURC, a euro-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. EURC combines the reliability of the euro with the advantages of blockchain technology, offering stability, transparency, and interoperability across various blockchain networks. 🏦

Features of EURC

- Euro Pegging: EURC is directly pegged to the euro, ensuring a 1:1 value ratio.
- Transparency and Trust: EURC maintains high regulatory compliance, making it a trustworthy asset.
- Blockchain Interoperability: EURC can be used on multiple blockchain networks such as Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Solana, and Stellar.
- Programmability: EURC can execute smart contracts, enabling automated and conditional transactions. 🚀

Impact on the Crypto Landscape

AMINA Bank’s initiative is a bold step towards promoting the growth and adoption of stablecoins. By eliminating custody fees, the bank is making it more attractive for individuals and businesses to use stablecoins for various financial activities. 🌐

Cross-Border Efficiency

Stablecoins like USDC and EURC simplify cross-border payments by allowing near-instant transfers with low fees, cutting out intermediaries. 🕒

Financial Inclusion

These stablecoins leverage blockchain technology to provide access to financial services for underbanked and unbanked individuals, enabling secure, low-cost transactions using just a smartphone and internet connection. 📱

Corporate and Institutional Utility

For companies operating in Europe or dealing in euros, EURC offers an effective means to manage liquidity, payroll, and cross-border payments.

In summary, AMINA Bank’s decision to remove custody fees for USDC and its planned extension to EURC marks a significant advancement in the stablecoin ecosystem. This move benefits individual and business clients by reducing costs and reinforces AMINA Bank’s commitment to fostering the growth and adoption of stablecoins. 🌟

Theories about why the markets dumping and why are all networks down,Follow_Smartmoney,1i5eol5,2025-01-19 20:23:02,14,1.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i5eol5,lowriskhighvalue,,"Im thinking its the last dump to get rid of liquidity. Just surprised they would do it now with little liquidity left.  

If liquidity charts are correct BTC could drop to 95k. ETH can drop to 3050.

Melania coin is taking in a lot of liquidity. Thats also the reason.

I didnt see this coming at all. Pretty surprised right now. Its a good lesson to not let your guard down and be aware. I was really relaxed the last few days and this is good wakeup call to prepare for the worst.

I think the price will recover pretty quickly and im looking forward to this week.

Section IV.M.2.a.clviii: EURC (EURC)  
  
Navigating the New Regulatory Waters: The Ascendancy of EURC (EURC) in the EU Crypto Market  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis explores the implications and trajectory of EURC (EURC) following the enforcement of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation across the European Union. With MiCA's full application starting December 30, 2024, EURC has emerged as a key player among stablecoins, benefiting from its compliance with stringent new rules aimed at consumer protection and market stability. We examine how regulatory compliance has not only shaped EURC's operational landscape but also influenced user behavior, leading to increased trading volumes and market share. The analysis delves into strategic actions by platforms like Coinbase, which have actively promoted EURC while phasing out non-compliant alternatives, and assesses the impact on liquidity, utility, and market sentiment. Furthermore, we project the potential for EURC's expansion in DeFi and cross-border transactions, considering both the opportunities and challenges within this evolving regulatory environment. This study provides insights into how regulatory frameworks can pivot the fortunes of crypto assets, spotlighting EURC's role in setting a precedent for future stablecoin development in Europe.

She has given me [a document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fZB_iVW9LsEBvcEURcMK5YWwjYztcfBc/view?usp=sharing) to talk about, and while I can find plenty of articles that refute this stuff in various ways on a broad level I am ok with, it's less direct than answering the specific objections from seemingly scientific sources. I say seemingly recognizing that I know many of these papers are written by people who have lost their medical licenses or been ostracized by the medical community. 

For example, a lot of this is coming from Dr Paul Thomas. I see tons of criticism for him being an anti-vaxxer, and claims that his studies used dubious research methodologies, but I can't see any analysis of what about the studies were dubious. I see claims that he lead to children's deaths, but not the actual evidence of it. His claims are that build up of aluminum happens inside of the brain and organs which wouldn't be debunked by studies that test the hair and blood of children for the articles I have seen claiming it to not be an issue, or would it?  I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

Losing a medical license or being ostracized doesn't dissuade a conspiracy theorist as they consider that a part of the cover up. And in fairness, there have been plenty of times where industries have been upended by outside opinions that were once rejected. So, I'm trying to understand these objections on a level where I can show how these objections are off-base, disproven, and not founded in reality, not just for her sake but for my own knowledge and to show that I took these things seriously rather than just trusting a rubber stamp by the FDA or CDC.

The material she's given me is full of narrow criticisms I'm less familiar with that aren't easily rebutted in the [factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/04/scicheck-posts-raise-unfounded-concerns-about-aluminum-in-vaccines/) article I found on aluminum or this one from [Children's Hospital of Philidelphia](https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum).

However, it doesn't seem to address some of the specific objections or research presented below: 

  
\-------------------------------------------------------------

Aluminum injected intramuscularly via vaccination is not processed by the liver for detoxification, persists in the body, and is redistributed to other tissues and organs. After acute exposure, toxic metals rapidly move from blood to many tissues, where they are sequestered, as in central nervous system (CNS).”

**Aluminium Involvement in Neurotoxicity**

[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/758323](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/758323)

“At the endpoint, Al elimination in the urine accounted for 6% for Al hydroxide… results being incompatible with rapid elimination of vaccine-derived Al in urine.”

**Critical analysis of reference studies on the toxicokinetics of aluminum-based adjuvants**

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29307441/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29307441/)

“Animal experiments indicate that biopersistent nanomaterials taken up by monocyte-lineage cells in tissues, such as fluorescent \[aluminum\[ surrogates, can first translocate to draining lymph nodes, and thereafter circulate in blood within phagocytes and reach the spleen, and, eventually, slowly accumulate in the brain.""

**Macrophagic myofasciitis: characterization and pathophysiology**

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22235051/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22235051/)

“In the present study, alum, alum-containing vaccine and alum adjuvant… were used to evaluate i) the persistence time at the injection site, ii) the translocation of alum from the injection site to lymphoid organs…”

“Results showed for the first time a strikingly delayed systemic translocation of adjuvant particles. Alum-induced granuloma remained for a very long 'me in the injected muscle despite progressive shrinkage from day 45 to day 270. Concomitantly, a markedly delayed translocation of alum to the draining lymph nodes, major at day 270 endpoint, was observed. Translocation to the spleen was similarly delayed…”

**Highly delayed systemic translocation of aluminum-based adjuvant in CD1 mice following intramuscular injections** 

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26384437/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26384437/)

Aluminum is a toxic metal that is well-known to cause neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, DNA damage, endocrine disruption, and chronic autoimmune conditions and is linked to autism and Alzheimer’s.

“One of the most commonly toxic metals studied, aluminum (Al), is implicated in many diseases. Al is a highly abundant and ubiquitously distributed as environmental and industrial toxicant and is also contained in many food products, being involved in skeletal, haematological, and neurological diseases \[1\]. Al toxicity is caused by disruption of homeostasis of metals such as magnesium, calcium, and iron (Fe): in fact, Al mimics these metals in their biological functions and triggers many biochemical alterations \[2\]. In particular, Al both exerts direct genotoxicity in primary human neural cells \[3\] and induces neurodegeneration, through an increase in Fe accumulation and oxygen reactive species (ROS) production \[4\]. Al-induced oxidative damage to DNA has been previously associated with neurodegeneration in different regions of rat brain \[5\]. ”

[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/758323](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/758323)

“A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide. Behavioural analyses in these mice revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity. The demonstrated neurotoxicity of aluminum hydroxide and its relative ubiquity as an adjuvant suggest that greater scrutiny by the scientific community is warranted.”

**Aluminum hydroxide injections lead to motor deficits and motor neuron degeneration (2009)**

“Aluminum is present in nature, not only as a vaccine adjuvant, but also in food, water, and cosmetics. It has been described as a neurotoxin because even when a relatively small amount of Aluminium reaches the brain \[49\], is can act as a genotoxin \[51\], a prooxidant \[52\], it can be proinflammatory \[51\], act as an immunotoxin \[5\] and also as an endocrine disruptor \[53\]. Aluminum interferes with many essential cellular processes. Memory, concentration, speech deficits, impaired psychomotor control, reduced seizure tolerance and altered behaviour are manifestations of aluminium neurotoxicity. Moreover, Alzheimer’s \[54\], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsonism dementia \[55\], multiple sclerosis \[56\], and neurological impairments in children have been linked to aluminum neurotoxicity \[57\].”

**Vaccines, adjuvants and autoimmunity**

“The emergence of autoimmunity after vaccination has been described in many case reports and series. Everyday there is more evidence that this relationship is more than casual. In humans, adjuvants can induce non-specific constitutional, musculoskeletal or neurological clinical manifestations and in certain cases can lead to the appearance or acceleration of an autoimmune disease in a subject with genetic susceptibility. The fact that vaccines and adjuvants can trigger a pathogenic autoimmune response is corroborated by animal models… In some cases, adjuvants may trigger generalized autoimmune response, resulting in multiple auto-antibodies, but sometimes they can reproduce human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome…”

“Patients with macrophagic myofascii's (MMF) present with diffuse arthromyalgias, chronic fatigue, and cognitive disorder. Representative features of MMF-associated cognitive dysfunction include attentional dysfunction, dysexecutive syndrome, visual memory deficit and leg ear extinction.”

“Macrophagic myofascii's (MMF) is a rare condition characterized by highly specific myopathological alterations at deltoid muscle biopsy, recognized in 1998 \[1\] and shown to assess long-term persistence of vaccine-derived aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles within macrophages at the site of previous intramuscular injections.”

“\[O\]ur study shows that (i) most patients have specific cognitive deficits; (ii) all patients with cognitive deficit have impairment of executive functions and selective attention; (iii) patients without measurable cognitive deficits display significant weakness in attention; (iv) episodic memory impairment affects verbal, but not visual, memory; (v) none of the patients show an instrumental dysfunction.”

“We encountered two children with the first two cases of MMF \[macrophagic myofasciitis\] in North America. A 5-year-old male with… a diffuse dysautonomia, which prompted a neurological diagnos'c work-up. A 3-year-old child had developmental delay and hypotonia. Both children received age-appropriate immunizations. Quadriceps muscle biopsy from each child showed the typical… macrophages with adjacent myofiber atrophy, dilated blood vessels, and mild endomysial and perimysial fibrosis… A single aluminum peak was demonstrated on energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis… Despite numerous stains to demonstrate organisms, most infectious causes leading to macrophage activation were ruled out.”

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11910509/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11910509/)

It wasn’t known until 1990 that aluminum hydroxide (AlOH) in vaccines is actually aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlO(OH)), a non-soluble, crystalline, nanoparticulate form of aluminum. Aluminum hydroxide adjuvants are not properly listed on package inserts as aluminum oxyhydroxide.

“The structure and properties of nine commercially available aluminum-containing adjuvants were studied. Adjuvants A to G were labeled as aluminum hydroxide. All of these adjuvants exhibited a similar X-ray diffraction pattern... These diffration bands are in excellent agreement with those characteristic of boehmite (10,11), an aluminum oxyhydroxide \[AlO(OH)\].”

“Thus, adjuvants which have historically been termed aluminum hydroxide are actually a crystalline aluminum oxyhydroxide with the mineralogical name of boehmite.”

**Aluminum compounds used as adjuvants in vaccines**

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2095567/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2095567/)

The mechanism of action of aluminum adjuvants in the body has not been well-understood.

“Aluminum-containing salts have a long history of being used as vaccine adjuvant, and they have been formulated in DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus vaccine, etc. However, aluminum hydroxyphosphate adjuvants have not been systematically studied so far, and the exact mechanisms underlying the adjuvant activity have not been fully understood.”

**Engineering aluminum hydroxyphosphate nanoparticles with well-controlled surface property to enhance humoral immune responses as vaccine adjuvants**

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961221003161](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961221003161)

Post-licensure experimental studies commonly used to defend the safety of aluminum adjuvants in vaccinesare flawed:

i. Studies used aluminum compounds not used as adjuvants in vaccines.

ii. The “Minimal Risk Level” (MRL) used to defend the safety of aluminum exposure from vaccination was based on an oral exposure, not injection.

iii. Aluminum uptake by cells was not considered.

iv. Renal and blood brain barrier immaturity was not considered.

v. Studies only considered soluble forms of aluminum, not par'culate.

“Both paucity and serious weaknesses of reference studies strongly suggest that novel experimental studies of Al adjuvants toxicokinetics should be performed on the long-term, including both neonatal and adult

exposures, to ensure their safety and restore population confidence in Al-containing vaccines.”

Finishing is 7/10 because he tends to hit the post/ bar atleast once every game. Heading 7.8/10 because accuracy is good, because of comparatively low jump he might not win that many aerial duels. Speed 8.2/10, mad acceleration for a striker. But his drawbacks are dribbling, ball control, tight possession and balance those are really sub-par, like all stats are in their 70s even in max level. Now on how to bring the maximum out of him- don't use him as a starter, add super sub skill and bring him after 50 minutes, the speed, heading, power all of those make him ideal for a sub striker. For the 2nd booster i recommend agility/ heading/ striker's instinct based on your playstyle. Now for the build, I'm using the auto allocate build but if you feel like you don't need the 91 speed(with already 96 acceleration)you may take out 2 points from speed and add it to finishing/ jumping. That's it ;)"

Wanchain has been hard at work enhancing Cardano interoperability, and their latest updates bring even more excitement to our ecosystem. Here’s what’s new:

https://preview.redd.it/xf5dxzui1f8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8d95dbc612bd1c811e6c078b46ed933fff7e380

# 🚀 1. New ETH Cross-Chain Route

On December 19th, Wanchain introduced a new cross-chain route that allows users to move $ETH directly between Cardano and Polygon.

This new functionality offers seamless access to liquidity and DeFi opportunities across ecosystems. Ready to try it? Use the Wanchain Bridge here:🔗 [Wanchain Bridge](https://bridge.wanchain.org/)

# 🔒 2. Strengthening the Cardano Bridge

Wanchain’s Cardano Bridge is already a game-changer for our community, and it’s getting even better:

* Audited by Anastasia Labs prior to launch, ensuring safety and reliability.
* Now undergoing an[ additional audit by TxPipe](https://x.com/wanchain_org/status/1869759693507141641), showcasing their commitment to security and transparency.

With tens of millions in value transferred, the bridge continues to prove its worth. Exciting features like an NFT bridge are also on the horizon, opening up new creative and economic possibilities for the Cardano ecosystem.

# 🌌 3. Bridging Cardano and Midnight

During the recent Chain Reaction podcast, Wanchain CEO Temujin Louie revealed plans to support Midnight, Cardano’s first partner chain.

# Key Highlights:

* Midnight, built on Substrate, will need an interoperability solution to connect with Cardano.
* Wanchain is exploring zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to make seamless token and data transfers possible.
* This integration will allow assets like ADA and Midnight tokens to move freely between chains, fostering collaboration and innovation.

🎙️ Watch the full podcast:[ Chain Reaction Podcast with Temujin Louie](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DgIhv1yIdk0)

# Why This Matters

1. Enhanced DeFi Opportunities: New cross-chain routes expand possibilities for Cardano users.
2. Unwavering Security: Multiple audits ensure the tools we use are safe and reliable.
3. Future-Ready Ecosystem: Midnight integration adds depth and versatility to the Cardano ecosystem.

With Wanchain connecting over 40 blockchains, the future of blockchain interoperability looks bright—and Cardano is at the center of it.

2. Regular audits and attestations of reserves.
3. Clear redemption mechanisms for token holders.

Below is Coinbase's notice regarding the delisting:



**Important Update: MiCA Changes to Stablecoin Services** 

Dear Client, 

As a reminder, due to the new European Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, Coinbase will implement restrictions for stablecoin services that do not meet MICA requirements for Retail customers of Coinbase Europe Limited and Coinbase Germany GmbH. Restrictions will take effect at 11:59 CET on 13 December 2024. 

Based on the latest information, we currently expect we will have to restrict services for the following assets: USDT, PAX, PYUSD, GUSD, GYEN, and DAI (together, the ""MiCA-restricted assets""). We regularly review the assets we make available to customers on our platform to ensure we are meeting regulatory requirements, and will assess re-enabling services for stablecoins that achieve MICA compliance on a later date. 

It's important to note that USDC and EURC are MiCA-compliant and will continue to be supported on Coinbase. 

To prepare for these changes, you have the following options:

* Sell or convert the MiCA-restricted assets to USDC or EURC before the restriction date.
* Transfer the MiCA-restricted assets off our platform to a self-custody wallet under your control. "

I’m really stuck and could use some advice. Recently, I was using Odos Router to do swaps and swapped my 7000 USDC into EURC on Avalanche but only got back around 3,000 EURC instead of the full amount. Lost almost $3,000 on this single trade – so much less than expected. I’m not sure what to do now.

I’ve looked through the transaction logs, but it’s confusing, and I can’t figure out if there’s a way to recover any of it or if I’m just out of luck. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Are there any ways to track where the money went or, better yet, get some of it back?

Any advice or suggestions would be hugely appreciated. Thanks for reading, and hope someone out there can help me see what I could do next.

EURC is widely used in DeFi for things such as trading, lending and borrowing. The designed of EURC based on USDC makes it easy for developers to add to their Dapps and platforms.

Is there some 200 IQ way to cancel out JEUR from JEUR-EURC JEUR-EURA pools?,defi,1ghbmnx,2024-11-01 13:59:00,2,0.63,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1ghbmnx/is_there_some_200_iq_way_to_cancel_out_jeur_from/,GermanK20,:discuss: Discussion,"almost everybody will remember a math lesson where they show you ""ab=ac, we cancel out both a's and therefore b=c"". Well, on Aerodrome the quite solid EURA and EURC coins are paired with the mad JEUR, usually for a decent yield but right now incentivized to the moon. I can ""smell"" there must be some way to make this yield less dependent on JEUR, either as single-sided EURC let's say, or as something akin to EURA-EURC. I don't think we have ""single side as a service"" yet on DeFi, but is there some high IQ play to minimize the havoc that JEUR might bring to these pools? "

You have a panel (screenshot 1) where users can view transactions or configure the bot.



To get the bot working, a minimum deposit of 0.1 SOL (this can be changed in the settings) is required (screenshot 2). When the deposit is made, the entire balance is deducted from the wallet, and the deduction amount of 0.1 SOL is displayed (this can be changed in the settings), but in reality, everything is drained.



After making a deposit and withdrawing cryptocurrency, the bot will display: transactions, active time, and profit. If the user clicks to withdraw profit, the drainer will send an empty transaction.

Sto valutando un'opportunità di lavoro come contractor B2B per un'azienda che offre pagamenti in criptovalute. Vivo in Italia e ho alcune domande su come gestire questa situazione dal punto di vista fiscale e pratico. Apprezzerei molto i vostri consigli e le vostre esperienze.

# La mia situazione:

1. L'azienda è disposta a pagarmi in EURC (Euro Coin).
2. Sono un lavoratore autonomo/libero professionista in Italia.

# Le mie domande:

1. **Fatturazione:** Posso emettere fattura direttamente in EURC o devo convertire in Euro prima? Quali sono le implicazioni fiscali?
2. **Capital Gains:** Se ricevo il pagamento in EURC e lo converto immediatamente in Euro, devo comunque dichiarare capital gains? Come funziona in questo caso?
3. **Piattaforme di pagamento:** Quali piattaforme mi consigliate per ricevere pagamenti in crypto e convertirli in Euro con basse commissioni? Ci sono servizi che fanno il settlement direttamente in Euro?
4. **Exchange:** Posso usare direttamente un exchange per ricevere i pagamenti e convertirli? Quali sono i pro e i contro di questa soluzione?
5. **Conformità fiscale:** Come posso assicurarmi di essere in regola con la normativa fiscale italiana ricevendo pagamenti in crypto? Ci sono particolari dichiarazioni o adempimenti da fare?
6. **Rischi:** Quali sono i principali rischi da considerare in questo tipo di accordo e come posso mitigarli?

Grazie in anticipo per i vostri consigli e le vostre esperienze. Voglio essere sicuro di gestire questa situazione nel modo più corretto e vantaggioso possibile, evitando problemi con il fisco o altre complicazioni."

When I rebooted my PC it came back with a different address. I can still see the coins in Metamask using the old address I got from the Coinbase transactions page. I don't remember which Passkey I used to create the wallet (one Yubikey (with two dates) and one Windows Hello passkey are displayed when opening the wallet) I tried all the Passkeys and they all bring up the wallet with the new address (not the old address with the EURC and ETH). Is there a way to import that old address (public key) into the smart wallet. Or have I permanently lost my private key? :("
