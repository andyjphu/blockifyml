Trend Following Strategy Analysis for Coin98 (C98) Cryptocurrency  
  
Abstract  
  
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of applying trend following strategies to Coin98 (C98), a notable cryptocurrency within the evolving digital asset market. Leveraging real-time data from X posts and broader market trends, we explore how C98's price movements can be effectively navigated using trend following techniques. The study delves into historical price data, identifying key trends and employing various technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to ascertain optimal entry and exit points. Performance metrics including ROI, volatility, and risk-adjusted returns are evaluated to gauge the efficacy of these strategies under different market conditions. Additionally, psychological factors influencing trend following, such as emotional discipline and decision-making under uncertainty, are discussed. The analysis also considers external influences like regulatory news and technological updates on C98's trend dynamics. By integrating insights from X posts reflecting community sentiment and strategic analyses, this research aims to provide actionable insights for investors interested in trend following within the volatile yet promising cryptocurrency sector, specifically focusing on Coin98.

**SUMMARY**

This Community Funding Proposal (CFP) is a strategic partnership between [Stably](https://stably.io/) and [Coin98](https://coin98.com/) to improve the infrastructure, accessibility, and interoperability of [MetaChain](https://defichain.com/metachain) by:

1. Expanding Coin98’s [CUSD](https://cusd.xyz/) fiat-backed stablecoin to MetaChain natively.
2. Enabling users globally to buy/sell MetaChain CUSD with traditional payment methods through [Stably Ramp](http://stably.io/ramp).
3. Enabling users globally to swap MetaChain CUSD with assets on other networks, including USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH, etc., through Stably Ramp.
4. Externalizing interest income generated from CUSD’s collateral reserve through a rebate program paid to the Community Fund to further develop the MetaChain ecosystem.
5. Unlocking the ability to create CUSD liquidity pools on MetaChain DEXs, which is a prerequisite before we can integrate our liquidity engine with MetaChain in the future **via a separate proposal**. Afterward, Stably Ramp will be able to list any native MetaChain asset (that has a liquidity pool) for free.

Stably serves as the token developer, administrator, and collateral manager of CUSD as well as the operator of Stably Ramp, while Coin98 supports the growth, adoption, and distribution of CUSD through wallet support, liquidity, marketing, a strong brand and global community of more than eight million users, particularly in Southeast Asia. Together, Stably and Coin98 aim to foster synergistic collaboration and provide community-first benefits to MetaChain while further enhancing its user experience and ecosystem development.

**WHAT IS CUSD?**

[Launched in December 2023](https://blog.cusd.xyz/introducing-cusd-a-fresh-update-empowering-the-cross-chain-economy-G5v22Brn), CUSD is a stablecoin backed 1-to-1 by highly liquid US Dollar-denominated assets, including bank deposits, money market instruments, and USDC (cash equivalents). The stablecoin is officially sponsored by Coin98 and issued by Stably via its Wyoming-based money service business (MSB) in compliance with FinCEN guidance and regulations. The collateral of CUSD is also held in a Wyoming statutory trust by for the benefit of KYC-verified token holders. Anyone can onboard to mint (buy) and redeem (sell) CUSD with fiat or USDC on a 1-to-1 basis through Stably Ramp. Additionally, third-party attestations are conducted periodically to verify that every CUSD token is backed 1-to-1 by collateral. Monthly collateral account statements are also published on Stably’s website.

CUSD is currently available on the [Viction](https://www.viction.xyz/) network and will be coming to more networks in the future.

**WHAT IS STABLY RAMP?**

Stably Ramp (available at [stably.io/ramp](http://stably.io/ramp)), is a powerful fiat <> crypto on and off-ramp that enables users from 170+ countries/regions to onboard and buy, sell, or swap hundreds of digital assets, including CUSD, using stablecoins and traditional fiat payments. Stably Ramp offers anyone in the world the ability to seamlessly move money between their bank account and Web3 in a matter of minutes, with as low as 0.50% in transaction fees.

Stably Ramp is also available as a plug-and-play iFrame widget for third-party integrators. Easily embed Stably Ramp in your application to open up a global fiat on/off-ramp for your users with just a few lines of code.

Last but not least, we do not charge any listing fee to projects that wish to list their assets on Stably Ramp. Interested projects only need to [apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf_vMeyiRCOoZMfs47JojQuyHMP0iKe-JlmSWy0-9Gqo0MmA/viewform?usp=sf_link) for us to review. Once approved, we will list the new asset within 30 days. Applicants are usually rejected only for legal, regulatory, and/or user safety concerns.

**WHY CUSD & STABLY RAMP?**

1. **Security & Transparency:** Bridged and decentralized stablecoins often precede native, fiat-backed ones on emerging chains but often carry significant risks, as seen with [$2 billion stolen](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/) from cross-chain bridges in 2022. Decentralized stablecoins, while not facing the same risks, rely on algorithmic adjustments and/or overcollateralization, making them risky, complex, and capital-inefficient. In contrast, issuing CUSD natively on MetaChain offers a secure, capital-efficient, and straightforward solution that’s not susceptible to bridge hacks and is backed 1-to-1 by USD-denominated collateral. Furthermore, all collateral assets are held separately from Stably and Coin98’s respective balance sheets in a bankruptcy-remote Wyoming statutory trust.  
2. **Scalability:** Major stablecoins like USDC and USDT typically don’t support smaller blockchains and over 90% of emerging chains lack native fiat-backed stablecoins. Oftentimes, users of these chains have to rely on bridging USDC and USDT over from other networks which is cumbersome, harder to scale, and costs more gas. Without a stablecoin that can be natively issued directly on the network through bank transfers, it would be more difficult for emerging chains to attract liquidity from the real world and facilitate large-scale DeFi activities.
3. **Global Fiat On & Off-Ramp:** Through Stably Ramp, users globally will be able to buy or sell CUSD through traditional payment methods like SWIFT, Visa, Mastercard, and, coming soon, PayPal plus Apple/Google Pay. Additionally, for Stably Ramp to list other native assets in the future, CUSD needs to be deployed on MetaChain first for us to source on-chain liquidity through CUSD pools on DEXs.
4. **Cross-Chain Liquidity:** Through Stably Ramp, users globally will be able to swap other digital assets, including USDC and USDT on larger chains, with MetaChain CUSD, thus facilitating the seamless transfer of liquidity from other chains to MetaChain. By the end of January 2023, there will be 100+ assets across 20+ chains listed on Stably Ramp, with more assets listed every week thereafter.  
5. **Sustainable Community Incentives:** While major stablecoin issuers prefer to keep (internalize) the yield earned from the collateral of their stablecoins, CUSD aims to externalize a fair share (at least 50%) of the yield earned through a rebate program with the DeFiChain Community Fund. With the rebates earned, the Community Fund can then turn around and fund MetaChain ecosystem development through various methods of their choosing. Put simply, CUSD is a community-first stablecoin.
6. **Free Integration & Listing:** Stably Ramp is 100% free for third-party iFrame integrators and new asset listing is also free for projects that apply, creating an accessible and cost-effective avenue for broader ecosystem participation and diversity.

CUSD is collateralized 1-to-1 by highly liquid US Dollar-denominated assets, including bank deposits, money market funds, and USDC (cash equivalents). The collateral of CUSD is held in a Wyoming bankruptcy-remote statutory trust for the benefit of KYC-verified token holders.
2. **How can I verify that CUSD is fully-backed?**  
We disclose the amount of CUSD in circulation and the USDC collateral monthly, which can be easily verified on-chain. We also publish monthly statements for the financial accounts holding off-chain collateral assets (i.e., bank deposits and money market funds). Additionally, Stably has retained [The Network Firm](https://www.thenetworkfirm.com/), a leading digital asset accounting firm, to attest to the amount of CUSD in circulation and its collateral backing quarterly. Please refer to our [transaparency page](https://stably.io/cusd/#attestations) for more information. 
3. **Who are your funds processing and banking partners?**  
[Bridge](https://www.bridge.xyz/), [Checkout](https://www.checkout.com/), [Custodia Bank](https://custodiabank.com/), and [Lead Bank](https://www.lead.bank/) (through Bridge).   
4. **What blockchains is CUSD issued on?**  
Currently, CUSD is live on [Viction](https://www.viction.xyz/) (formerly TomoChain) mainnet. Stably and Coin98, in coordination, have and continue to evaluate new blockchains to expand CUSD, with DeFiChain’s MetaChain being a leading candidate.
5. **Has Stably launched a stablecoin before?**  
Stably has launched over a dozen stablecoins (under various brands) since 2018, with Horizen Labs’ [ZUSD](http://stably.io/zusd) and Coin98’s CUSD as the most recent additions in Q4 2023. Some of our other notable blockchain clients include Ripple, VeChain, Stellar, and Tezos.
6. **Has the CUSD smart contracts been audited?**  
Yes. Over the years, various versions of our stablecoin smart contracts have been audited by leading firms like [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/), [Slowmist](https://www.slowmist.com/), and [Quantstamp](https://www.quantstart.com/). Most recently, in September 2023, [Verichains](https://www.verichains.io/) conducted an audit of the CUSD smart contract on Viction.
7. **How do I buy and sell CUSD?**  
Please refer to our [support page](https://support.stably.io/en/collections/3947753-stably-ramp) for step-by-step instructions.

We maintain a robust compliance program that implements policies and procedures based on best industry practices, including on-chain transaction monitoring. Additionally, Bridge is also a regulated MSB (with its own compliance program) that we partner with to handle user onboarding and fiat funds processing.
12. **What is your roadmap for CUSD?**  
After launching MetaChain CUSD, Stably shall consider integrating its liquidity engine with a MetaChain DEX to source liquidity for other native assets (using MetaChain CUSD as the routing asset), allowing MetaChain projects to list their assets for free on Stably Ramp. This will help drive more volume and activities to CUSD, the DEX, and the MetaChain network itself. Last but not least, Coin98 is also open to supporting the MetaChain network in its ecosystem, including the [Coin98 Super Wallet](https://c98.link/coin98-super-wallet), once MetaChain CUSD has been launched successfully. 

**MILESTONES & FUNDING REQUEST**

"A short-lived surge for wallet tokens, post-FTX",coingecko,z6xkhn,2022-11-28 09:10:17,1,0.67,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/coingecko/comments/z6xkhn/a_shortlived_surge_for_wallet_tokens_postftx/,coingecko,,"Trust Wallet ([TWT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/trust-wallet-token)) surged \~90%, after CZ’s tweet amid the FTX crisis. Similarly, SafePal, which has Binance as one of its investors, saw its [SFP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/safepal) token appreciate in value, peaking at 129% in price gains. Other wallet tokens with smaller market caps like Coin98 ([C98](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coin98)), TokenPocket ([TPT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/token-pocket)) and XDEFI ([XDEFI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xdefi)) similarly saw significant price increases as well, after a buying frenzy was sparked.

That said, it was all but a momentary price surge. Month-to-date (MTD) performance is subpar, with Trust Wallet making the most headway with a 57% price rise MTD.

Enter the trade at the bottom of peak 5 of Newtons Wave.

Exit the trade around $10

Enjoy 2757% Gains :-)

**NOTE** Do not entry the trade based on the time or day. Stick only to the peaks and troughs of Newtons Wave.

The distance between peaks on the sine waves never change, but the timeline can (the distance it takes to travel between peak can, due to dilution, slow frequency of trades e.t.c)


How Do Sine Waves Precede And Dictate The Price In Trading Markets?

Trading is no mystery. The answer lies in the waves - sine waves.

Imagine one big ocean. Made up of lots of big, medium and small waves. That is the trading market.

Price movement (up and down) follows the contours of these sine waves.

The big daddy wave is called newtons wave.

As the tide rolls in you get big swells and waves (linear rises, parabolic rises), the tide rolls out you get (exponential decay, bear down phase).

Sine waves allow you to predict price movement.

Are you using sine waves to trade?

As the weather gets cooler in the Northern Hemisphere it is important to treat your brain and body with the utmost respect. We sure hope everyone is safe, well and warm. 

It is that time of the month where we sit back and reflect on what happened in September, and we join in on a discussion.

Ethereum has successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. At block 15537393 on September 15, 2022 at 1:42:42 EST Ethereum finalizes “The Merge.” [ETHW trading is live and the ETHW token has been distributed to eligible clients](https://blog.kraken.com/post/15482/ethereumpow-ethw-trading-starts-now-token-distribution/).

Kraken was also thrilled to announce that our COO Dave Ripley will succeed Kraken’s Co-founder and CEO Jesse Powell, who will become chairman of the board of directors. We are grateful for Jesse’s leadership, as well as his dedication to crypto values and Kraken’s mission. We are delighted that he will be embarking on a new journey but will still be working very close to us.

### Coin98 Finance - Coin98 Exchange

### Coin98 Labs - Coin98钱包

通过 Coin98 实验室（Coin98 Labs），该团队将创建新的 DeFI 解决方案，使用户更方便地访问市场。该团队已经构建了几个解决方案，包括钱包、交易、投资组合和市场解决方案。更多的功能即将出现，包括扩展钱包上的新链，L2 解决方案的集成，以及 C98 在以太坊和 BSC 上的质押。整合新的 AMMs 和跨链桥梁也将是重点。

* 其中，Coin98 钱包是一个非托管的、跨链的去中心化金融（Defi）投资组合，是 Coin98 Labs 的旗舰产品。它可用于在许多不同的区块链上存储、发送和接受数字资产。 ​​​​​​​
* 在多个 DEX 中，包括 Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, QuickSwap, LunaSwap, Pangolin, MDEX 等26个公链，寻找最佳的价格和滑价交易代币。 ​​​​​​​
* 用户可以在钱包中直接访问一些位于不同公链的 Dapp。 ​​​​​​​
* 有移动（iOS和android）和 Chrome 版本。

### Coin98钱包 - Cross-Chain Bridge 跨链桥

截止至 2021年8月26日，Coin98 钱包的跨链桥（Cross-Chain Bridge）目前支持5个区块链公链之间的交易，包括以太坊 (ETH & ERC20)、币安智能链 (BEP20)、Solana (SOL & SPL)、Tron (TRC20) 和 Avalanche (C 链和 X 链)、Avalanche C-Chain & X- chain。支持以下网络之间的代币交换：

1. SPL <> ERC20 Bridge: 将 Solana 上的 SPL 代币转换为以太坊上的 ERC20 代币。
2. ERC20<> BEP20 <> TRC20: 在以太坊、币安智能链和 Tron 区块链之间转换代币。

📷

## Coin98 代币生态系统的其他组成部分

### Coin98 Ventures

📷

### Coin98 Network

分析关于区块链的知识，包括研究和信息分析网站 Coin98 Insights（没有中文或英文版），Coin98 Analytics 每周数据分析周报，Margin ATM （没有中文或英文版）。

### Coin98 Terminal （终端）

Coin98 终端允许用户使用 MultiSend 功能将代币发送到多个地址。此外，该平台的代币发行者可以在多个区块链公链创建自定义代币。 代币可以以多种格式发行，这包括 ERC-20、BSC BEP-20、Huobi ECO Chain HRC-20、TRON TRC-20 和 Solana SPL 代币。另外，用户在创建代币的标志，使用代币记录功能。

### 优势

1. Coin98 代币与其生态系统可形成良性循环。用户对 Coin98 生态系统中产品的依赖可促进对 C98 代币的需求。而上涨的 C98 代币价格可以鼓励用户为 Coin98 生态做贡献，以获得更多奖励。
2. 有正在建设中的多链基础设施目前市场中尚不存在专为多链产品搭建的基础设施服务。Coin98 决定独立开发一套基础设施，从多链钱包开始，逐渐扩张成为了一整套多链 DeFi 平台，让每个人都能同时享受多条公链上的 DeFi 服务。【5】如上文，Coin98 钱包现在支持5个公链上的资产交易。
3. 对未来产品发展方向有明确的规划

📷

### 价格是否合理？

目前 C98 的持币者依赖于 Coin98 Exchange DEX 的交易费用来获得盈利。在没有通缩设计的前提下，Coin98 Exchange 是 C98 币价上涨的主要驱动力之一。 但目前 Coin98 在并没有能够查找到的 DEX 排名，属于小众的 DEX 平台，有待拓展用户和更多业务。

Here’s what you need to know about the assets:

**Coin98 (C98)**

Coin98 is a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution that allows users access to cross-chain swaps, staking and yield farming. Coin98 offers a full suite of products, including Coin98 Wallet, Coin98 Exchange and Space Gate (a cross-chain bridge). The C98 token is the native utility token of the platform and can be used to pay services fees and incentivize staking. It is also used to vote on governance proposals and to grant access to unique membership rights.

**Galxe (GAL)**

Galaxe, formerly known as Project Galaxy, provides an open, decentralized, and multi-chain framework for digital credentials. The protocol aims to create an infrastructure that enables a unified identity system for Web3 platforms. GAL is the native token for the project and can be used to pay for the use of the data network, create and edit credentials as well as to vote on platform fees and the use of treasury funds.

**Rocket Pool (RPL)**

Rocket Pool is a decentralized staking service for Ethereum’s ETH cryptocurrency. Rocket Pool allows stakers to create a node with 16 ETH rather than the standard 32 ETH. RPL is the native cryptocurrency of the protocol, used to incentivize honest staking behavior as well as to participate in the governance and future development of protocol.

**Stargate Finance (STG)**

Stargate Finance is a composable liquidity transport protocol. Users can transfer assets cross-chain with Stargate’s Omnichain native asset bridge and access the protocol’s unified liquidity pools that enable decentralized lending and borrowing. The native token STG can be staked on the Stargate platform and is used to reward users who provide liquidity.

**Synapse (SYN)**

Synapse is a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing transactions between Layer 1, sidechain and Layer 2 ecosystems. The protocol facilitates interoperability between blockchains with its asset bridge, token swap, liquidity pools and staking opportunities. SYN is the platform’s governance token, giving holders a say in the direction of the platform. It is also used to pay for transactions within the network and incentivize liquidity providers.

### Will Kraken make more assets available?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch – including which assets we are considering. All of Kraken’s available tokens can be found here, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken’s blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be making available in the future. 

### Trade with caution

There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is also no guarantee a market order will execute at a certain price. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.

Sellers were busy selling over the weekend.. Bitcorn dipped to low $18k and is currently fighting for $19k and ETH tumbled to the $1300s. It is what it is — just bear market things. Looking forward, we’ve got FOMC this Wednesday that will likely result in a 75 basis points rate hike with a non-negligible chance of 100 basis points.
