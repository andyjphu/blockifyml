Trend Following Strategy Analysis for Coin98 (C98) Cryptocurrency  
  
Abstract  
  
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of applying trend following strategies to Coin98 (C98), a notable cryptocurrency within the evolving digital asset market. Leveraging real-time data from X posts and broader market trends, we explore how C98's price movements can be effectively navigated using trend following techniques. The study delves into historical price data, identifying key trends and employing various technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to ascertain optimal entry and exit points. Performance metrics including ROI, volatility, and risk-adjusted returns are evaluated to gauge the efficacy of these strategies under different market conditions. Additionally, psychological factors influencing trend following, such as emotional discipline and decision-making under uncertainty, are discussed. The analysis also considers external influences like regulatory news and technological updates on C98's trend dynamics. By integrating insights from X posts reflecting community sentiment and strategic analyses, this research aims to provide actionable insights for investors interested in trend following within the volatile yet promising cryptocurrency sector, specifically focusing on Coin98.

**SUMMARY**

This Community Funding Proposal (CFP) is a strategic partnership between [Stably](https://stably.io/) and [Coin98](https://coin98.com/) to improve the infrastructure, accessibility, and interoperability of [MetaChain](https://defichain.com/metachain) by:

1. Expanding Coin98‚Äôs [CUSD](https://cusd.xyz/) fiat-backed stablecoin to MetaChain natively.
2. Enabling users globally to buy/sell MetaChain CUSD with traditional payment methods through [Stably Ramp](http://stably.io/ramp).
3. Enabling users globally to swap MetaChain CUSD with assets on other networks, including USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH, etc., through Stably Ramp.
4. Externalizing interest income generated from CUSD‚Äôs collateral reserve through a rebate program paid to the Community Fund to further develop the MetaChain ecosystem.
5. Unlocking the ability to create CUSD liquidity pools on MetaChain DEXs, which is a prerequisite before we can integrate our liquidity engine with MetaChain in the future **via a separate proposal**. Afterward, Stably Ramp will be able to list any native MetaChain asset (that has a liquidity pool) for free.

Stably serves as the token developer, administrator, and collateral manager of CUSD as well as the operator of Stably Ramp, while Coin98 supports the growth, adoption, and distribution of CUSD through wallet support, liquidity, marketing, a strong brand and global community of more than eight million users, particularly in Southeast Asia. Together, Stably and Coin98 aim to foster synergistic collaboration and provide community-first benefits to MetaChain while further enhancing its user experience and ecosystem development.

**WHAT IS CUSD?**

[Launched in December 2023](https://blog.cusd.xyz/introducing-cusd-a-fresh-update-empowering-the-cross-chain-economy-G5v22Brn), CUSD is a stablecoin backed 1-to-1 by highly liquid US Dollar-denominated assets, including bank deposits, money market instruments, and USDC (cash equivalents). The stablecoin is officially sponsored by Coin98 and issued by Stably via its Wyoming-based money service business (MSB) in compliance with FinCEN guidance and regulations. The collateral of CUSD is also held in a Wyoming statutory trust by for the benefit of KYC-verified token holders. Anyone can onboard to mint (buy) and redeem (sell) CUSD with fiat or USDC on a 1-to-1 basis through Stably Ramp. Additionally, third-party attestations are conducted periodically to verify that every CUSD token is backed 1-to-1 by collateral. Monthly collateral account statements are also published on Stably‚Äôs website.

CUSD is currently available on the [Viction](https://www.viction.xyz/) network and will be coming to more networks in the future.

**WHAT IS STABLY RAMP?**

Stably Ramp (available at [stably.io/ramp](http://stably.io/ramp)), is a powerful fiat <> crypto on and off-ramp that enables users from 170+ countries/regions to onboard and buy, sell, or swap hundreds of digital assets, including CUSD, using stablecoins and traditional fiat payments. Stably Ramp offers anyone in the world the ability to seamlessly move money between their bank account and Web3 in a matter of minutes, with as low as 0.50% in transaction fees.

Stably Ramp is also available as a plug-and-play iFrame widget for third-party integrators. Easily embed Stably Ramp in your application to open up a global fiat on/off-ramp for your users with just a few lines of code.

Last but not least, we do not charge any listing fee to projects that wish to list their assets on Stably Ramp. Interested projects only need to [apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf_vMeyiRCOoZMfs47JojQuyHMP0iKe-JlmSWy0-9Gqo0MmA/viewform?usp=sf_link) for us to review. Once approved, we will list the new asset within 30 days. Applicants are usually rejected only for legal, regulatory, and/or user safety concerns.

**WHY CUSD & STABLY RAMP?**

1. **Security & Transparency:** Bridged and decentralized stablecoins often precede native, fiat-backed ones on emerging chains but often carry significant risks, as seen with [$2 billion stolen](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/) from cross-chain bridges in 2022. Decentralized stablecoins, while not facing the same risks, rely on algorithmic adjustments and/or overcollateralization, making them risky, complex, and capital-inefficient. In contrast, issuing CUSD natively on MetaChain offers a secure, capital-efficient, and straightforward solution that‚Äôs not susceptible to bridge hacks and is backed 1-to-1 by USD-denominated collateral. Furthermore, all collateral assets are held separately from Stably and Coin98‚Äôs respective balance sheets in a bankruptcy-remote Wyoming statutory trust.  
2. **Scalability:** Major stablecoins like USDC and USDT typically don‚Äôt support smaller blockchains and over 90% of emerging chains lack native fiat-backed stablecoins. Oftentimes, users of these chains have to rely on bridging USDC and USDT over from other networks which is cumbersome, harder to scale, and costs more gas. Without a stablecoin that can be natively issued directly on the network through bank transfers, it would be more difficult for emerging chains to attract liquidity from the real world and facilitate large-scale DeFi activities.
3. **Global Fiat On & Off-Ramp:** Through Stably Ramp, users globally will be able to buy or sell CUSD through traditional payment methods like SWIFT, Visa, Mastercard, and, coming soon, PayPal plus Apple/Google Pay. Additionally, for Stably Ramp to list other native assets in the future, CUSD needs to be deployed on MetaChain first for us to source on-chain liquidity through CUSD pools on DEXs.
4. **Cross-Chain Liquidity:** Through Stably Ramp, users globally will be able to swap other digital assets, including USDC and USDT on larger chains, with MetaChain CUSD, thus facilitating the seamless transfer of liquidity from other chains to MetaChain. By the end of January 2023, there will be 100+ assets across 20+ chains listed on Stably Ramp, with more assets listed every week thereafter.  
5. **Sustainable Community Incentives:** While major stablecoin issuers prefer to keep (internalize) the yield earned from the collateral of their stablecoins, CUSD aims to externalize a fair share (at least 50%) of the yield earned through a rebate program with the DeFiChain Community Fund. With the rebates earned, the Community Fund can then turn around and fund MetaChain ecosystem development through various methods of their choosing. Put simply, CUSD is a community-first stablecoin.
6. **Free Integration & Listing:** Stably Ramp is 100% free for third-party iFrame integrators and new asset listing is also free for projects that apply, creating an accessible and cost-effective avenue for broader ecosystem participation and diversity.

Additionally, Stably has retained [The Network Firm](https://www.thenetworkfirm.com/), a leading digital asset accounting firm, to attest to the amount of CUSD in circulation and its collateral backing quarterly. Please refer to our [transaparency page](https://stably.io/cusd/#attestations) for more information.

Most recently, in September 2023, [Verichains](https://www.verichains.io/) conducted an audit of the CUSD smart contract on Viction.

We maintain a robust compliance program that implements policies and procedures based on best industry practices, including on-chain transaction monitoring. Additionally, Bridge is also a regulated MSB (with its own compliance program) that we partner with to handle user onboarding and fiat funds processing.
12. **What is your roadmap for CUSD?**  
After launching MetaChain CUSD, Stably shall consider integrating its liquidity engine with a MetaChain DEX to source liquidity for other native assets (using MetaChain CUSD as the routing asset), allowing MetaChain projects to list their assets for free on Stably Ramp. This will help drive more volume and activities to CUSD, the DEX, and the MetaChain network itself. Last but not least, Coin98 is also open to supporting the MetaChain network in its ecosystem, including the [Coin98 Super Wallet](https://c98.link/coin98-super-wallet), once MetaChain CUSD has been launched successfully.

Similarly, SafePal, which has Binance as one of its investors, saw its [SFP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/safepal) token appreciate in value, peaking at 129% in price gains. Other wallet tokens with smaller market caps like Coin98 ([C98](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coin98)), TokenPocket ([TPT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/token-pocket)) and XDEFI ([XDEFI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xdefi)) similarly saw significant price increases as well, after a buying frenzy was sparked.

That said, it was all but a momentary price surge. Month-to-date (MTD) performance is subpar, with Trust Wallet making the most headway with a 57% price rise MTD.

Enter the trade at the bottom of peak 5 of Newtons Wave.

Exit the trade around $10

Enjoy 2757% Gains :-)

**NOTE** Do not entry the trade based on the time or day. Stick only to the peaks and troughs of Newtons Wave.

The distance between peaks on the sine waves never change, but the timeline can (the distance it takes to travel between peak can, due to dilution, slow frequency of trades e.t.c)


How Do Sine Waves Precede And Dictate The Price In Trading Markets?

Trading is no mystery. The answer lies in the waves - sine waves.

Imagine one big ocean. Made up of lots of big, medium and small waves. That is the trading market.

Price movement (up and down) follows the contours of these sine waves.

The big daddy wave is called newtons wave.

As the tide rolls in you get big swells and waves (linear rises, parabolic rises), the tide rolls out you get (exponential decay, bear down phase).

Sine waves allow you to predict price movement.

Are you using sine waves to trade?

As the weather gets cooler in the Northern Hemisphere it is important to treat your brain and body with the utmost respect. We sure hope everyone is safe, well and warm. 

It is that time of the month where we sit back and reflect on what happened in September, and we join in on a discussion.

**Coin98 (C98)**

Coin98 is a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution that allows users access to cross-chain swaps, staking and yield farming. Coin98 offers a full suite of products, including Coin98 Wallet, Coin98 Exchange and Space Gate (a cross-chain bridge). The C98 token is the native utility token of the platform and can be used to pay services fees and incentivize staking. It is also used to vote on governance proposals and to grant access to unique membership rights.

**Galxe (GAL)**

Galaxe, formerly known as Project Galaxy, provides an open, decentralized, and multi-chain framework for digital credentials. The protocol aims to create an infrastructure that enables a unified identity system for Web3 platforms. GAL is the native token for the project and can be used to pay for the use of the data network, create and edit credentials as well as to vote on platform fees and the use of treasury funds.

**Rocket Pool (RPL)**

Rocket Pool is a decentralized staking service for Ethereum‚Äôs ETH cryptocurrency. Rocket Pool allows stakers to create a node with 16 ETH rather than the standard 32 ETH. RPL is the native cryptocurrency of the protocol, used to incentivize honest staking behavior as well as to participate in the governance and future development of protocol.

**Stargate Finance (STG)**

Stargate Finance is a composable liquidity transport protocol. Users can transfer assets cross-chain with Stargate‚Äôs Omnichain native asset bridge and access the protocol‚Äôs unified liquidity pools that enable decentralized lending and borrowing. The native token STG can be staked on the Stargate platform and is used to reward users who provide liquidity.

Synapse is a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing transactions between Layer 1, sidechain and Layer 2 ecosystems. The protocol facilitates interoperability between blockchains with its asset bridge, token swap, liquidity pools and staking opportunities. SYN is the platform‚Äôs governance token, giving holders a say in the direction of the platform. It is also used to pay for transactions within the network and incentivize liquidity providers.

### Will Kraken make more assets available?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch ‚Äì including which assets we are considering. All of Kraken‚Äôs available tokens can be found here, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken‚Äôs blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be making available in the future.¬†

### Trade with caution

There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is also no guarantee a market order will execute at a certain price. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.
