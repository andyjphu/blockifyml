The first round of grants will be processed through Questbook in approximately one month.

Read on to learn more!

Grants dashboard: [https://alchemix.questbook.app/](https://alchemix.questbook.app/)



The community has voted to allocate an initial $100,000 in ALCX for the grants program. Once most of these funds have been spent, we will evaluate this initial grants period, and together we can plan a future framework for the program.

Alchemix has a [wishlist](https://alchemixdao.notion.site/Solidity-and-Full-Stack-Grants-b80f9fef252444f28f418ef40b31845b). You can apply to build the projects.  Applicants will receive some support from Alchemix contributors when neeeded, but we envision a future where a community of builders helps each other. The Wishlist describes tools that the core team hasn't had time to build, but that list is just the beginning.  We expect the grandest and most creative suggestions to come from our community.  Alchemix awaits your applications, those who are successful will be well rewarded!

Grants are priced in USD, and paid in ALCX. Payments are divided over 4 milestones.

1: MVP Submission  
2: 1st Round Review And Feature Requests  
3: 2nd Round Review  
4: Approval, Deployment, and Handoff/Maintenance

Payment is made upon the completion of milestones 2, 3, and 4.



More detail on the milestones, and on everything else related to the grants program can be found in [the Notion](https://alchemixdao.notion.site/Alchemix-Grant-Specs-e6f931733b294e6da70c8c23db9a23e6). This is required reading!

3 Composable Lock Types. Infinite Possibilites.

- Time Lock - Time Locks are a powerful way to lock away transferable value. These are locks that unlock after a period of time has passed, permitting the value within to be withdrawn only following the passing of that period.
- Value Lock - Create interesting incentive structures with Value Locks. Maybe you‚Äôd like to specify vesting terms to unlock after a token exceeds a certain value.
- Address Lock - Unlock the full power of Revest Smart Vaults when you use Address Locks. Use address locks created by the community or create one of your own for your specific use case.

Lock Any ERC-20

ERC-20s are the standard token type of the Ethereum blockchain, and now you can lock any ERC-20 in Revest Smart Vaults. Whether it be Chainlink, Dai, Wrapped Bitcoin, or any other token, it is fully compatible with Revest Smart Vaults.

Improved tokenomics and DAO are in the works,Alchemix,xhews6,2022-09-18 08:05:08,5,0.86,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alchemix/comments/xhews6/improved_tokenomics_and_dao_are_in_the_works/,Bennixus,,"Did you know that the Alchemix team is working on updated tokenomics and DAO?

They shared their vision back in May and received great community feedback. Since then these improvements have been high on the priority list and they are determined to deliver!

Recently it was shared in the Discord that development of the DAO is progressing and that an audit is planned for November. With these things it is important to note that an actual ETA cannot be given yet, as depending on the results of the audit the development could take more time than initially anticipated. As always, the Alchemix team prioritizes safety and security over everything else and will only release these improvements until they are certain of its security.

Personally I am super excited about these improvements as it will align protocol success with the value of the ALCX token. This means that the ALCX token will become more than just a governance token! If you want you can read more about the vision of the improvement in the article below:

Note: this article is the vision of the Alchemix team in May 2022, the actual end product might differ as it is subjected to auditing and further development."

Exodus 22.5.20 Desktop/Mobile Release - Mobile ExoDEX Launch,ExodusWallet,uudroq,2022-05-20 22:34:44,12,0.93,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExodusWallet/comments/uudroq/exodus_22520_desktopmobile_release_mobile_exodex/,CryptoEngineerObrien,Announcement,"Hey there, [r/ExodusWallet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExodusWallet/)!

Today, we are releasing Exodus version **22.5.20** on Desktop and Mobile! Here is what to expect:

# ExoDEX on Mobile

This is a beta feature that was added update, but we're happy to announce that ExoDEX is live on mobile! ExoDEX is our very own decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. DEXes allow users to perform on-chain token swaps with tokens on a specific chain. DEX aggregators source liquidity from multiple DEX providers, offering users more favorable fees and token prices than a single exchange.

This release of ExoDEX, powered by [Jupiter Aggregator](https://jup.ag/), only supports Solana and SPL tokens. Support for other networks will be coming in the future. For more information on ExoDEX and how to use it, we have an article all about it [over here](https://support.exodus.com/article/1915-exodex).

# New Logo

This update will bring the new logo to Exodus on all platforms! You can read about the design insight behind our new logo [here](https://www.exodus.com/news/exodus-logo-rebrand/).

# Reduced DOGE Fees

DOGE core update 1.14.5 lowered DOGE transaction fees to 0.01 per KB. This is now supported!

# New Coins

* **Livepeer (LPT)** on ETH
* **Verasity (VRA)** on ETH
* **API3 (API3)** on ETH
* **Coti (COTI)** on ETH
* **Frax (FRAX)** on ETH
* **Frax Shares (FXS)** on ETH
* **Alchemix (ALCX)** on ETH

You can find the full release notes for this update and all past updates [here](https://www.exodus.com/releases/). You can manually update your wallet [here](https://www.exodus.com/download/). If you‚Äôd like to wait, this release will be available when your wallet checks for updates on Monday. This update is live on Android now and will be live iOS once Apple approves the update.

---

Feel free to get hyped and discuss this update here and on the [Exodus Discord server](http://discord.gg/Exodus). Also, for Facebook users out there, check out our new [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/exodus.io/)! As always, thank you for using Exodus!"

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that Kraken now supports **Alchemix (ALCX), Barnbridge (BOND), Jasmy (JASMY), Mask Network (MASK), Render (RNDR), Spell Token (SPELL), Tribe (TRIBE)** and **Universal Market Access (UMA)!**

### Funding and Trading

Funding is live, and trading will begin on April 1 at approximately 14:30 UTC. Keep an eye on the [status page](https://status.kraken.com/) for updates.

You can add these tokens to your Kraken account by navigating to [**Funding**](https://www.kraken.com/u/funding), selecting the asset, and hitting **Deposit**. Deposits require **20 confirmations** (\~5 minutes).

All tokens are tradeable against **USD** and **EUR**, on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) and the [Kraken Pro](https://trade.kraken.com/) interface with the following price precisions and minimum deposits  


|**Asset**|**Price precision**|**Minimum deposit**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|ALCX|2|0.05 ALCX|
|BOND|3|0.5 BOND|
|JASMY|5|100 JASMY|
|MASK|3|1 MASK|
|RNDR|4|3 RNDR|
|SPELL|6|1,000 SPELL|
|TRIBE|4|10 TRIBE|
|UMA|3|1 UMA|

**Note:¬† Jasmy (JASMY) trading is not available to residents of the United States, Canada and Japan.**

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the assets:

**Alchemix (ALCX) ‚Äì** Alchemix is an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. Loans taken out on Alchemix repay themselves over time as the user‚Äôs collateral earns yield. The ALCX token can be staked to earn additional ALCX or used to govern the protocol‚Äôs development.

**Barnbridge (BOND) ‚Äì** BarnBridge is a cross-platform risk-tokenizing protocol, designed to reduce DeFi-related risks such as market volatility and fluctuating interest rates. It allows users to select a risk profile and strategy to suit their trading objectives. BOND is the BarnBridge utility and governance token that lets holders steer future protocol development.

**Jasmy (JASMY) ‚Äì** Jasmy aims to decentralize the maintenance and management of sensitive information through the use of ‚Äòpersonal data lockers‚Äô on the Jasmy network. The JASMY token is the network‚Äôs utility token that is used to secure the network and pay for personal data that users send and receive from IoT devices.

**Mask Network (MASK) ‚Äì** Mask Network aims to bring the privacy and benefits of Web3 to centralized Web 2.0 social media applications. The Mask open-source browser extension enables users to send cryptographically encrypted messages secured by the Ethereum blockchain and to display their Web 3.0 profiles on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

**Render (RNDR) ‚Äì** The Render Network is a distributed rendering network for GPU compute built on Ethereum. It aims to connect users that require GPU power with node operators who have idle GPU capacity. The RNDR token is used by creators on the network to pay providers for their processing power.

**Spell Token (SPELL) ‚Äì** SPELL is a reward token tied to the Abracadabra lending platform on the Ethereum blockchain. SPELL¬† enables users to leverage interest-bearing crypto assets as collateral to borrow Magic Internet Money (MIM) ‚Äî a USD-pegged stablecoin that can be exchanged for other stablecoins.

**Tribe (TRIBE) ‚Äì** TRIBE is the governance token that allows individuals to steer the development of Fei‚Äôs decentralized, scalable and DeFi-native algorithmic stablecoin FEI USD. The Fei network‚Äôs goal is to be more capital-efficient than fiat-collateralized or crypto-collateralized stablecoin alternatives.

**Universal Market Access (UMA) ‚Äì** Universal Market Access is an Ethereum blockchain protocol for creating and trading synthetic assets and decentralized financial products. The protocol‚Äôs governance token, UMA, allows holders to vote on upgrades and changes to the project‚Äôs development road map.

### Will Kraken list more assets?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch ‚Äì not even which assets we are considering. All of Kraken‚Äôs listed tokens are available on our website, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken‚Äôs blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be listing in the future.¬†

### Trade with caution

There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is also no guarantee of executing at a certain price for a market order. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.

Listing an asset or token for trade is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or participate in the associated network. Do your own research and invest at your own risk."

It's few weeks that I'm studying solidity, truffle, web3 etc. And now i guess it's the time that I try to create a real project for improving my very poor blockchain skills.  


I'm already a developer, so I feel like I can try to develop a ""real life application"" although this will be just a test, I need to know all the stuff that can be done before developing my idea.  


I want to start with something that seems very cool and also a little bit difficult. [Alchemix.fi](https://Alchemix.fi).  


I know that they have a [github account](https://github.com/alchemix-finance) but I'd love to know how the platform work from a developer point of view.

In particular I'd like to know the following:  


1. Once that we deposit on the platform, what happen to the money? They are sent in some vault to gain a APY yield?
2. Why when we deposit DAI or ETH and we can borrow alUSD and alETH?
3. How is it possible that the ALCX token gains value? The gains are somehow linked to how many dai are deposited by the users?

&#x200B;

I know that the questions are not strictly on the development, but I need to understand the right operations of the platform."

Tokemak: Searching for Sustainability Liquidity,ethfinance,schme3,2022-01-25 11:28:35,44,0.9,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/schme3/tokemak_searching_for_sustainability_liquidity/,FlamesRiseHigher,Educational,"(Hello all, this is an early draft of the piece I've been writing about Tokemak. It's aimed at readers who are already aware of various concepts in DeFi, but hopefully it's not too high-level. I'm hoping to publish this in a blog soon as I want to build a portfolio of my research/writing, so any feedback is extremely helpful. Ask all the questions you want. I know some sections are weak, specifically the Tokenomics piece, but I wasn't sure how much I should delve into that.

My personal opinion, FWIW, is that TOKE is worth looking at as an investment as long as you pay close attention to it's development and continually work to earn yield on their platform. I might expand more on this at some point or just make a separate post in the daily.

Thanks to /u/TheHighFlyer and /u/panthoreon for suggesting Tokemak when I asked for ideas. Took me a bit longer to put it together than I anticipated, but it's finally here.)

**Tokemak**

Incentives are a core aspect of what makes cryptocurrencies work. They function on the idea that we can capture greed and make it work for us, instead of against us. Bitcoin emits BTC to incentivize miners to support their network. Ethereum emits ETH to incentivize miners/stakers to support their network. Without these incentives and without the greed that chases them, the networks would collapse. No one runs a node out of the goodness of their heart. This simple concept permeates everything in the crypto space.

In 2020, liquidity mining gained significant popularity amongst protocols and DAOs. To incentivize people to provide liquidity on automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap, projects adopted the idea that they could pay people to provide liquidity through their own protocol‚Äôs emissions. Projects that needed deep liquidity to function adopted an inflationary economic model so that they could mint new tokens and give them to users who provide liquidity pairs to specific AMM pools. These users are referred to as liquidity providers (LPs). This was a natural step forward at the time as many new projects suffered from low liquidity. However, it ended up being a relatively short-term solution as when a project began to faulter and the value of the protocol‚Äôs token dropped, the yield earned by the LPs dropped. This lowered the incentives for the LPs to risk their funds providing liquidity and exposed the LP to impermanent loss. Negative price action ended up leading to evaporating liquidity which created high volatility and drove the price down further to near-zero valuations. These kinds of events exposed the mercenary nature of the LPs and the fragility of liquidity mining.

This problem highlighted the need for an alternative economic model. One solution that appeared in 2021 was Tokemak. Carson Cook, aka LiquidityWizard, a lead developer for Tokemak, started the project as a way for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to move away from liquidity mining, which is essentially renting liquidity, and move towards something he described as ‚Äúsustainable liquidity‚Äù.

Under the Tokemak protocol, LPs provide single-sided assets to the system to earn yield, but instead of earning the fees from liquidity pools, LPs are paid out in the protocol‚Äôs governance token, TOKE. The protocol uses its own inflationary model to incentivize LPs to provide single-sided liquidity to their pools. To create the actual liquidity pairs, Tokemak has a pool that is made up of base assets like ETH and USDC. The initial funds in this pool were collected in a genesis event where contributors were given TOKE in return for these base assets. These Protocol Controlled Assets (PCA) are paired with the various assets provided by LPs (ABC assets) and then directed by a new class of users called Liquidity Directors (LDs) to liquidity pools on AMMs like Uniswap or Sushiswap. LDs direct this liquidity by voting with the TOKE that they hold. Currently, the PCA pools are also incentivized with TOKE emissions to ensure there are enough base assets to make up the liquidity pairs. Users can earn TOKE by staking ETH, USDC, FRAX, ALUSD, DAI, MIM, UST, LUSD, and FEI in the PCA pool.

Tokemak determines how much to pay LPs through a balancing act determined by its users in their unique pools called ‚Äúreactors‚Äù. Reactors are made up of two different pools: one for LPs to provide ABC assets and one for LDs to provide TOKE. These two pools are balanced by a supply and demand mechanic controlled by the protocol. When there‚Äôs a higher amount of LD-staked TOKE versus LP-staked ABC in the reactor, APR goes up for LPs and down for the LDs. This balance mechanic is beneficial for liquidity seekers because instead of constantly paying LPs, which is renting liquidity, DAOs and other organizations can buy TOKE and act as LDs by voting in week-long cycles to incentivize liquidity for whatever asset they deem necessary. If Alchemix, for example, needs to deepen their liquidity, they can buy more TOKE and vote for the reactor that supplies an ALCX pair. This raises the APR for LPs providing ALCX, attracting more ALCX deposits, therefore deepening the liquidity this reactor can provide.

The Tokemak documentation notes that the amount of ABC staked to a specific reactor can only reach a maximum of 1.5x the TOKE staked to said reactor. This limit is in place because a certain amount of TOKE is needed in each reactor as collateral to protect against impermanent loss. Taking this limit into account, in the best-case scenario for organizations looking to buy liquidity, they could see a 3x return in value of liquidity per TOKE staked to the reactor. Putting it more simply: buying $1 of TOKE and voting with it in a reactor could buy $1.50 of the ABC asset and $1.50 of the protocol-supplied PCA to match, which adds up to $3 of liquidity. However, this is the best-case scenario. It‚Äôs more realistic that the ratio of ABC:TOKE would be lower in the reactor due to the APR balance mechanics in play. In the end though, the protocol is a significant improvement on the old method of liquidity mining, where one would rent liquidity from LPs. Instead, DAOs and Market Makers buy TOKE and own, in perpetuity, the ability to direct liquidity to wherever they deem necessary for their projects.

**Sustainability & The Singularity**

In this early stage of development, Tokemak is using its emissions to incentivize all protocol participants, but that won‚Äôt always be the case. The sustainable liquidity that this protocol plans to create sits further in the future. This will be achieved through the accumulation of the liquidity fees generated from the liquidity the protocol deploys. The liquidity fees are taken in by the protocol which are then used to supplement the PCA and ABC pools. This slowly building supply of protocol-provided liquidity will gradually replace the need for LPs, with the eventual goal of completely phasing them out. As this occurs, TOKE emissions can be reduced and eventually shut off entirely, thus achieving a sustainable model. This event, where the liquidity owned by the protocol is enough to cover the ABC and PCA pools, is referred to as *the* *Singularity*. As the Tokemak protocol controls more liquidity, it accrues more assets from liquidity fees, therefore controlling even more liquidity. This effect has led to Tokemak being described as a black hole of liquidity.

As the singularity approaches and TOKE emissions approach zero, the need for LP supplied assets to reactors and the PCA pool will drop off entirely. However, the need for Liquidity Directors remains. Those who hold TOKE and control where the protocols massive liquidity warchest is deployed will be in high demand. TOKE holders vote for liquidity direction each cycle, and if they have don‚Äôt have a specific project they already need to support, they can be convinced to vote a certain way with bribes. Bribers win as they get liquidity for a fraction of the previous cost, and TOKE holders win as they receive bribes in return. It‚Äôs a win-win situation for everyone but those LPing directly on AMMs. It can be argued that the more beneficial strategy is to take their liquidity and provide these assets to Tokemak; earning themselves TOKE and cementing their ability to earn yield off liquidity in the future.

**Impermanent Loss & Composability**

Another reason, AMM LPs should consider using Tokemak is the lack of impermanent loss. Tokemak has multiple mechanics in place to mitigate this effect for its single-sided LPs. First, the protocol will pull from the reserve of the ABC asset in deficit in an effort to make the LPs whole. The protocol builds reserves of ABC assets over time from the liquidity fees it accrues. If using the reserve of the asset in deficit is not enough to cover the impermanent loss, the protocol will begin pulling from other ABC asset surpluses across the system. If this is still not enough, the protocol will then pull from the TOKE rewards allocated to the reactor, and if this is insufficient the protocol will use the TOKE staked to the reactor, effectively slashing the LDs who provided them. In a sense, LDs staking TOKE to reactors are collateralizing them in addition to directing liquidity to them. If slashing the staked TOKE still does not cover the loss, the protocol will begin using the PCA. In this step, the protocol first uses ETH and/or stable coins and if not enough are available, it will then use highly liquid assets from the PCA which would be sold for ETH or stables. This last step is not programmed into the protocol, but executed by the DAO multi-sig. The documentation suggests it is highly unlikely this stage will ever be reached. All of this means that there is more incentive for LPs to stake their assets in these channels due to the protection from impermanent loss that the protocol ensures. The numerous backstops the protocol puts in place shows the commitment to protecting the single-sided LP.

Additionally, Tokemak maintains the composability that is common among AMMs. When LPs deposit their ABC in a reactor, they get tABC in return. These tABC tokens represent a claim to the assets deposited into the token reactor. They can be redeemed 1:1 pending the end of the weekly cycle. The benefit is that tAssets are transferable so they can be sold elsewhere or used in other DeFi protocols to earn yield on top of the rewards being accrued from Tokemak. This level of composability is a must for protocols that plan to become base pieces of DeFi infrastructure, or ‚ÄúDeFi lego‚Äù.

**Tokenomics (Token Economics)**

The tokenomics of the protocol are relatively straightforward. The total supply outlined in the documentation is 100 million TOKE. The protocol holds 30%, or 30 million, in reserve for ‚Äúreward emissions‚Äù; the tokens used to incentivize the PCA and reactor pools. These tokens are projected to be emitted over 24 months or 104 weekly cycles, but the documentation notes this timeframe can change.

5%, or 5 million tokens, was used for ‚ÄúCycle Zero‚Äù which was the first distribution of TOKE. This was made up of the ‚ÄúDeGenesis event‚Äù and ‚ÄúCoRE (Collateralization of Reactors Event)‚Äù. The DeGenesis event was a period of time where users could deposit ETH/USDC and receive TOKE in return. This event used 3 million TOKE for the sale. CoRE was an event where users voted for the first time with their TOKE to see which projects would get the first Tokemak reactors. 36 projects were whitelisted by the Tokemak team for this event, but only 5 would be selected through the governance votes for the initial reactors. Once selected the Tokemak team approached each of these projects with a proposed TOKE<>ABC swap. 2 million TOKE was set aside for these swaps.

The rest of the tokens were distributed as follows: 9%, or 9 million, is held by the Tokemak DAO as a reserve. 14%, or 14 million, is given to the development team. 16.5%, or 16.5 million, was given to contributors to the protocol. 17%, or 17 million, was given to early investors. And last, 8.5%, or 8.5 million, is for DAOs & Market Makers. The tokens given to contributors, early investors, and DAOs & Market Makers are all held under a 12-month cliff with a 12-month linear vesting schedule.

**Conclusion**

Tokemak was created to solve problems. The token mechanics used by the protocol create an interesting set of incentives and cyclical effects. Early on, LPs can provide idle assets to the single-sided, impermanent loss-mitigated pools where they can earn TOKE. LPs give up the liquidity fees they‚Äôd typically earn, but the TOKE they get in return represents and controls the growing protocol-controlled liquidity. The protocol wins as it accrues more and more liquidity and users win as they gain control of an asset that directs said liquidity. This allows users, such as DAOs, the ability to purchase and own their liquidity in perpetuity simply by buying TOKE. This is a significant improvement over the old method of continuously paying off mercenary LPs; a method that is costly, inefficient, and fragile. Eventually, the protocol will control enough liquidity that LPs will be phased out and those who hold TOKE will control a ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù of liquidity. At this point, TOKE will be in high demand as it controls a massive, ever-growing pool of assets that can be deployed across DeFi. TOKE holders will be able to rent out their liquidity at rates that are much more capital efficient than the old method of liquidity mining. Overall, Tokemak creates a better situation for each party involved, while increasing efficiency of liquidity mining and reducing fragility in DeFi projects. For these reasons, it‚Äôs hard not to believe that Tokemak has a bright future at the core of Decentralized Finance."

* **Adam Cochran mentioned a strong outperform coin of 2022.**
* **The strong outperform coins of 2022 are Felixo(FLX)(Reflexer), Curve Dao (CRV).**
* **Alchemix (ALCX), Balancer (BAL), Frax Share (FXS), Ribbon Finance (RBN).**

As everyone knows 2021 was a pleasant year for the [cryptocurrency](https://thenewscrypto.com/tag/cryptocurrency/) industry with enormous ups and downs. Accordingly, Adam Cochran, a popular investor, and professor have predicted the strongly outperforming coin for 2022. As per his prediction, the strongly outperforming coins are Felixo (FLX)(Reflexer), Curve Dao (CRV), Alchemix (ALCX), Balancer (BAL), Frax Share(FXS), and Ribbon Finance (RBN).

## 1. Felixo (FLX) (Reflexer)

FLX has two different core functions, the first one is similar to other models such as Maker protocol, the RAI system will have a surplus and debt auctions. Moreover, debut auctions will autonomously mint and 1auction new FLX in case the system is underwater. The other one is ungoverning the RAI system, once the vast majority of governance capabilities are completely removed from the system. Reflexer Ugovernance Token will provide further ungovernance and enable the community to take decisions on how to remove themselves from discretion over the protocol.

Furthermore, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/reflexer-ungovernance-token/), FLX‚Äôs price was trading at $526.81 with a 24-hour trading volume of $4,066,525. The circulating supply of FLX is 158,624.67 FLX. It can traded in top crypto exchanges such as MEXC, Uniswap (V3), Uniswap (V2), and Loopring Exchange.

## 2. Curve Dao (CRV)

Curve Dao has gained substantial attention by following its remit as an AMM specifically for stablecoin trading. CRV carries the standard risks associated with depositing funds in smart contracts and dealing with AMMs, which is known as impermanent loss. The explosion in DeFi trading has ensured Curve‚Äôs longevity, with AMMs turning over huge amounts of liquidity and associated user profits.

More so, at press time, the CRV price is trading at $6.49 with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,054,617,387. According to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/), the circulating supply of CRV is 450,131,820.99 CRV. It can be traded in top crypto exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, CoinFLEX, CoinTiger, and Huobi Global. In the last 24-hour CRV price gained over 85.

## 3. Alchemix (ALCX)

Alchemix lets you reimagine the potential of [DeFi ](https://thenewscrypto.com/news/defi-news/)by providing highly flexible instant loans that repay themselves over time. It can be traded in top crypto exchanges such as Niance, OKEx, FTX, Bitget, and HitBTC. At the time of writing ALCX‚Äôs price is trading at $344.03 with a 24-hour trading volume of $53,537,272. The circulating supply of ALCX is 900,716.83 ALCX. In the last 24-hour ALCX price surged over 11%.

## 4. Balancer (BAL)

An automated market maker (AMM) designed on the [Ethereum ](https://thenewscrypto.com/news/ethereum-news/)blockchain is Balancer, launched in 2020 March. But Balancer is not the first DeFi protocol to make use of AMMs, it has brought a new face and approach to liquidity. Balancer (BAL) enables users to add to liquidity pools to earn BAL. At the time of writing BAL‚Äôs price is trading at $19.45 with a 24-hour trading volume of $40,336,860. In a day BAL‚Äôs price spiked by nearly 0.38%. It can traded in top crypto exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, CoinTiger, FTX, and Huobi Global.

## 5. Frax Share (FXS)

The first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin system is Frax Protocol. FRAX is an open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain, currently implemented on Ethereum. The main goal of the Frax protocol is to provide highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixes-supply digital assets like BTC. The Frax Protocol is a community-driven and unique design stable coin. More than 60% of the supply of FXS is issued over a number of years to liquidity providers and yield farmers. Henceforth, FXS is an investment and governance asset while FRAX is the currency token.

Accordingly, Frax Share (FXS) price is trading at $32.87 with a 24-hour trading volume of $22,295,681. As per [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/frax-share/), the circulating supply of FXS is 16,209,404.70 FXS. FXS can be traded in crypto exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Bitget, HitBTC, and Gate.io.

## 6. Ribbon Finance (RBN)

Ribbon utilized financial engineering to develop structured products that deliver sustainable yield. Ribbon‚Äôs first product focuses on yield through automated options strategies. Structured products are packaged financial instruments that use a combination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, like betting on volatility, enhancing yields, or principal protection.

Hence more, at press time RBN‚Äôs price is trading at $3.80 with a 24-hour trading volume of $60,307,303. The circulating supply of RBN is 51,168,00.03 RBN. In a day RBN‚Äôs price skyrocket over 20%. It can also in traded in crypto [exchanges](https://thenewscrypto.com/news/exchange-news/) such as Gate.io, Coinbase Exchange, ZT, MEXC, and Uniswap (V3)."

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

 

**TLDR**:

Alchemix is one of the leading stablecoins in anchoring $alUSD to a stablecoin, specifically $DAI. Whereas $DAI is minted by collateralising crypto assets.

If you understand $DAI well, stablecoins are created by debt. That is, you mortgage your property so that you get debt for various purposes. And $alUSD continues to be made up of these debts. This makes $alUSD complicated and unpredictable risks.

We've seen CDSs created by real estate debt and they broke down during the 2008 crisis. I am not here to say that $alUSD is bad or good, but clearly, past events make us more alert. However, $alUSD still has a meaning for the development of the whole Crypto Space.

 

# What is Alchemix?

Alchemix is a no-loss stable coin that uses $DAI as collateral. It includes real inflation and real growth in the ecosystem which makes it quite different. It also talks about capital efficiency. In the early DeFi days people didn‚Äôt think so much about capital efficiency and were mostly thinking about over-collateralisation, risk management, and yield.

Today things are a bit different we have grown so much further and can think a little bit more about how to efficiently use our capital to get more returns. There is some over-collateralisation in the Alchemix protocol but it also uses your collaterals to help you earn some form of yield so in that way it kind of offsets it quite a bit.

Alchemix is an evolution to stable coins. It mainly uses reserves to back the stablecoin, while using a bond-like mechanism to reward users. Such similar ideas exist, like $DSD and $ESD. The problem with $ESD and $DSD is that it was just level one to stable coin bond market innovation. They had a great concept but the execution was not as robust or as good. I see Alchemix as a way to make it better and evolve to level two of what crypto bonds could be in terms of stablecoin.

# Why is the collateralization 200%?

If the protocol had a lower collateralization ratio then loan repayments would take a lot longer. Right now with the current yield, it's around two years to get repaid but with a lower collateralization ratio that might take five, seven, or even 10 years especially if yields start dropping in DeFi. That's like a lifetime especially in DeFi and crypto so having such a long repayment time is a little bit unrealistic.

The other thing is that let's say you borrow $alUSD and sell it for $DAI then you put it into Alchemix and borrow more alUSD. This can be done in a loop right now because of the collateralization ratio which means that you can basically lever your vault up to 2x. If we had a lower collateralization ratio this kind of recursive strategy could be exploited even more and that wouldn‚Äôt have a good effect on the system. It might also destabilize the peg because people would over-leverage their vaults so for the health of the system and reasonable debt repayment times the collateralization ratio is set to 200%.

# How does it maintain stability?

The big picture here is that there are two big pools. The first one is the collateral pool where you take your $DAI and put it into the collateral pool to get $alUSD out. Then you have the transmuter pool where you can put $alUSD in and get $DAI out.

One of the important things in this entire game is that 1 $DAI equals 1 $alUSD. Sometimes prices change and it is not always one for one. Let's say 1 $alUSD is now worth $1.5 which is a 50% increase. People will now put $DAI into the collateral pool and get $alUSD out because if you put 100 $DAI you will always get 50 $alUSD out as it is 50% collateral and $alUSD will always be equivalent to one $DAI. Now since 1 $alUSD is worth $1.50 then more people will turn their DAI into $alUSD and increase the supply of $alUSD and reduce the prices back to $1.

When $alUSD is less than $1 you go to the transmuter pool and put $alUSD in it. Let's say your $alUSD is now worth 80 cents instead of $1 and you don't want to spend it because it is not worth that much so you put it in the transmuter pool. Once the pool generates yield and more $DAI then you get to give them 80 cents worth of $alUSD and get 1 $DAI out which is worth $1 because it is one for one in the system."

**TLDR**:

Alchemix is one of the leading stablecoins in anchoring $alUSD to a stablecoin, specifically $DAI. Whereas $DAI is minted by collateralising crypto assets.

If you understand $DAI well, stablecoins are created by debt. That is, you mortgage your property so that you get debt for various purposes. And $alUSD continues to be made up of these debts. This makes $alUSD complicated and unpredictable risks.

We've seen CDSs created by real estate debt and they broke down during the 2008 crisis. I am not here to say that $alUSD is bad or good, but clearly, past events make us more alert. However, $alUSD still has a meaning for the development of the whole Crypto Space.

If you understand $DAI well, stablecoins are created by debt. That is, you mortgage your property so that you get debt for various purposes. And $alUSD continues to be made up of these debts. This makes $alUSD complicated and unpredictable risks.

We've seen CDSs created by real estate debt and they broke down during the 2008 crisis. I am not here to say that $alUSD is bad or good, but clearly, past events make us more alert. However, $alUSD still has a meaning for the development of the whole Crypto Space.

 

# What is Alchemix?

Alchemix is a no-loss stable coin that uses $DAI as collateral. It includes real inflation and real growth in the ecosystem which makes it quite different. It also talks about capital efficiency. In the early DeFi days people didn‚Äôt think so much about capital efficiency and were mostly thinking about over-collateralisation, risk management, and yield.

Today things are a bit different we have grown so much further and can think a little bit more about how to efficiently use our capital to get more returns. There is some over-collateralisation in the Alchemix protocol but it also uses your collaterals to help you earn some form of yield so in that way it kind of offsets it quite a bit.

Alchemix is an evolution to stable coins. It mainly uses reserves to back the stablecoin, while using a bond-like mechanism to reward users. Such similar ideas exist, like $DSD and $ESD. The problem with $ESD and $DSD is that it was just level one to stable coin bond market innovation. They had a great concept but the execution was not as robust or as good. I see Alchemix as a way to make it better and evolve to level two of what crypto bonds could be in terms of stablecoin.

# Why is the collateralization 200%?

If the protocol had a lower collateralization ratio then loan repayments would take a lot longer. Right now with the current yield, it's around two years to get repaid but with a lower collateralization ratio that might take five, seven, or even 10 years especially if yields start dropping in DeFi. That's like a lifetime especially in DeFi and crypto so having such a long repayment time is a little bit unrealistic.

The other thing is that let's say you borrow $alUSD and sell it for $DAI then you put it into Alchemix and borrow more alUSD. This can be done in a loop right now because of the collateralization ratio which means that you can basically lever your vault up to 2x. If we had a lower collateralization ratio this kind of recursive strategy could be exploited even more and that wouldn‚Äôt have a good effect on the system. It might also destabilize the peg because people would over-leverage their vaults so for the health of the system and reasonable debt repayment times the collateralization ratio is set to 200%.

# How does it maintain stability?

The big picture here is that there are two big pools. The first one is the collateral pool where you take your $DAI and put it into the collateral pool to get $alUSD out. Then you have the transmuter pool where you can put $alUSD in and get $DAI out.

One of the important things in this entire game is that 1 $DAI equals 1 $alUSD. Sometimes prices change and it is not always one for one. Let's say 1 $alUSD is now worth $1.5 which is a 50% increase. People will now put $DAI into the collateral pool and get $alUSD out because if you put 100 $DAI you will always get 50 $alUSD out as it is 50% collateral and $alUSD will always be equivalent to one $DAI. Now since 1 $alUSD is worth $1.50 then more people will turn their DAI into $alUSD and increase the supply of $alUSD and reduce the prices back to $1.

When $alUSD is less than $1 you go to the transmuter pool and put $alUSD in it. Let's say your $alUSD is now worth 80 cents instead of $1 and you don't want to spend it because it is not worth that much so you put it in the transmuter pool. Once the pool generates yield and more $DAI then you get to give them 80 cents worth of $alUSD and get 1 $DAI out which is worth $1 because it is one for one in the system."
