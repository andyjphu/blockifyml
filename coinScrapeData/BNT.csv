Best site for liquitity mining pools ?,cryptoQandA,1h1da5o,2024-11-27 14:54:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1h1da5o/best_site_for_liquitity_mining_pools/,maxikaz19,,"Liquidity mining has become a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, allowing users to earn rewards by providing liquidity to various pools. As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, identifying the best platforms for liquidity mining is crucial for maximizing returns while managing risks. This guide explores some of the top liquidity mining platforms available in 2024, their features, and what makes them stand out.

### What is liquidity mining

Liquidity mining involves supplying cryptocurrency to a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange (DEX) in return for rewards, typically in the form of tokens or transaction fees. These pools facilitate trading by ensuring there is enough liquidity for users to buy and sell assets without significant price slippage. When users contribute to these pools, they receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens that represent their stake in the pool.

### Top platforms for liquidity mining

Here are some of the leading platforms that offer robust liquidity mining opportunities:

#### **1. Uniswap**

Uniswap is one of the most well-known decentralized exchanges and has pioneered the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. 

- **Key Features:**
  - **Wide Asset Range:** Supports a vast number of ERC-20 tokens.
  - **Low Fees:** Charges a standard fee of 0.3% per trade, distributed among liquidity providers.
  - **User-Friendly Interface:** Accessible even for beginners with no minimum deposit requirement.

Uniswap's innovative approach allows users to earn rewards through both transaction fees and governance tokens (UNI), making it a top choice for liquidity mining.

#### **2. Curve Finance**

Curve Finance specializes in stablecoin trading, offering low slippage and efficient swaps between stable assets.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Optimized for Stablecoins:** Focuses on stablecoin pairs, reducing volatility.
  - **Low Transaction Fees:** Charges significantly lower fees compared to other DEXs, around 0.04%.
  - **Liquidity Pools:** Offers various pools tailored for different stablecoins like USDC, DAI, and Tether.

Curve‚Äôs unique algorithm minimizes impermanent loss, making it an attractive option for liquidity providers focusing on stable assets.

#### **3. PancakeSwap**

Operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), PancakeSwap offers fast transactions with lower fees compared to Ethereum-based platforms.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Speed and Cost Efficiency:** Transactions are processed quickly with minimal fees.
  - **Diverse Services:** In addition to swapping tokens, it offers staking and yield farming options.
  - **Community Governance:** Users can participate in governance decisions through CAKE tokens.

PancakeSwap‚Äôs integration with the Binance ecosystem enhances its appeal among users looking for quick trades and diverse investment opportunities.

#### **4. Balancer**

Balancer operates as both an automated portfolio manager and a liquidity provider, allowing users to create custom liquidity pools.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Customizable Pools:** Users can set their own token ratios and fees.
  - **Multiple Pool Types:** Offers shared, private, and smart pools catering to different needs.
  - **Governance Token (BAL):** Rewards liquidity providers with BAL tokens based on their contributions.

Balancer‚Äôs flexibility in pool creation makes it ideal for users looking to tailor their investment strategies.

#### **5. Bancor**

Bancor was one of the first platforms to introduce automated market making and remains a strong player in the DeFi space.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Impermanent Loss Protection:** Offers mechanisms to mitigate impermanent loss for liquidity providers.
  - **Low Fees:** Charges between 0.1% to 0.5% per transaction.
  - **Token Rewards:** Users earn BNT tokens as rewards for providing liquidity.

Bancor‚Äôs unique features help attract liquidity providers who are concerned about volatility risks associated with traditional AMMs.

### Evaluating Liquidity Mining Opportunities

When selecting a platform for liquidity mining, consider the following factors:

- **Yield Potential:** Look at historical returns from each platform's pools.
  
- **Liquidity Depth:** Higher liquidity often leads to lower slippage; ensure that the pools you choose have sufficient depth.

- **Tokenomics:** Understand how rewards are distributed and any potential inflationary effects on token value.

- **Risk Management:** Assess mechanisms in place to protect against impermanent loss and other risks associated with providing liquidity.

### Tools for Identifying Opportunities

Utilizing analytics tools can significantly enhance your ability to find lucrative liquidity mining opportunities:

- **Nansen**: This blockchain analytics platform provides insights into on-chain data, helping investors identify profitable pools based on metrics like transaction volume and smart money participation.

- **DeFi Dashboards**: Many platforms offer dashboards that rank liquidity pools by volume or return rates, allowing investors to make informed decisions quickly.

The world of liquidity mining is dynamic and offers numerous opportunities across various platforms. Each platform has its unique strengths and weaknesses, making it essential for investors to conduct thorough research before committing their assets. 

Uniswap remains a leader due to its extensive asset support and user-friendly interface, while Curve Finance excels in stablecoin trading efficiency. PancakeSwap offers speed on BSC, Balancer provides customization options, and Bancor focuses on mitigating risks associated with impermanent loss.

By leveraging analytics tools like Nansen and staying informed about market trends, investors can maximize their returns while contributing positively to the DeFi ecosystem. As always, ensure that you understand the risks involved in providing liquidity before diving into these opportunities."

A Look Into Grayscale's Proposed Privacy ETF & Potential Role of Oasis,altcoin,1ddj57f,2024-06-11 13:00:41,8,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1ddj57f/a_look_into_grayscales_proposed_privacy_etf/,DC600A,,"The financial aspect of crypto is a huge draw for users. Now, despite the volatility of the crypto markets, the lucrative pull is undeniable. So, when Bitcoin ETFs got approved and succeeded, it paved the way for Ethereum ETFs. While early market sentiments are yet to call out the final result if it is a hit or a miss, indications are it will be successful. The focus now shifts to another untapped potential for ETFs - privacy, and it is a big deal.

Whether you are a veteran or a newbie in the ETF scene, Grayscale is a well-known name that inspires confidence. Some sources have suggested that Grayscale is prepped for filing a privacy ETF and they have been considering and monitoring several projects since 2022. Here is the list of assets under consideration:

* 0x (ZRX)
* 1inch (1INCH)
* Apecoin (APE)
* Arweave (AR)
* Axie Infinity (AXS)
* Bancor (BNT)
* BitTorrent (BTT)
* Bora (BORA)
* Iota (IOTA)
* Kava (KAVA)
* Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)
* Loopring (LRC)
* Monero (XMR)
* Near (NEAR)
* Numeraire (NMR)
* [Oasis (ROSE)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/)

While Ethereum itself depends on L2 solutions to implement privacy effectively in its ecosystem, there is no dearth of blockchain protocols that have been working in this field and have achieved various degrees of success. As a pioneer in smart privacy for web3 and AI with privacy-preserving technologies in use,¬†[Oasis](https://oasisprotocol.org/)'s inclusion in the above list is as expected. However, before getting into how or why Oasis / $Rose could feature in Grayscale's plans, it is useful first to examine the makeup of the privacy ETF.

Ed, a well-known persona in the blockchain and crypto and web3 space, and an engaged Oasis community member with 3+ years of experience being embedded across the ecosystem while contributing towards community building, business development, networking, and marketing activities, has put it all together.

Let's start by looking at what type of projects will constitute this ETF.

* Data Privacy Solution Providers
* Cyber Service Providers
* Blockchain-Based Privacy Solutions
* Network & Communication Security Provider
* Privacy-Preserving Protocols

The projects considered also have some eligibility criteria to fulfill before qualifying and we will mention the top 3 here.

First, a substantial portion, if not all, of their revenue has to come from one or more of the categories mentioned above. Second, the projects need to be listed on U.S., non-U.S. developed market or emerging market exchanges. Third, the market cap must equal to or in excess of $250M.

Projects are scored as 'primary' or 'secondary' based on three metrics.

1. Data Privacy Solutions, Cyber Services, or Blockchain Privacy Solutions take priority over other sectors
2. If ALL or just some business operations are aimed at privacy
3. By alignment with GDPR and CCPA regulations

The prominence and priority of Oasis in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF plans becomes evident based on the above discussion as it firmly falls under the 'primary' category. While the fact remains that quite a few of the projects mentioned above in Grayscale's list have lost relevance, Oasis has gone from strength to strength emerging as a regulatory-compliant solution provider in addition to its confidentiality capabilities.

According to Ed, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there are other reasons too that underline why Oasis / $Rose is well-positioned in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF.

To note, Grayscale has reiterated its principal investment strategy of avoiding exposure to digital assets directly, and still, $Rose has potentially a significant role to play in the privacy ETF when it comes out. Intrigued? The answer lies in a single entity having effected a huge accumulation of $Rose (approximately $440M) on chain through Coinbase. To deep dive into this,¬†[check out Ed's thread](https://x.com/ECrypto0/status/1800135721648546253)¬†on Twitter (X).

Favorable market sentiments of ETFs aside, Grayscale's backing of the privacy narrative is well-deserved and timely. Oasis has always been privacy-focused in line with its founder, Prof. Dawn Song's expertise in computer security and decentralized confidentiality. In conclusion, the potential is all there for a blockbuster privacy ETF with an MVP role by Oasis, but nothing is concrete yet. Hopefully, we will hear something positive very soon.

Let's discuss in the comments what you like about privacy ETFs, and also what other criteria, metrics, and projects you think would make it more robust and impactful."

Don't make the same mistake as me and stake your crypto on third party sites.,CryptoCurrency,1awowkq,2024-02-21 17:06:48,99,0.89,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1awowkq/dont_make_the_same_mistake_as_me_and_stake_your/,DeQQster,REMINDER,"I am in crypto since 2017 but that didn't save me from losing more money than I can stomach. in 2021, after trading crypto for years, taking risky steps and buying shitcoins for shot term gains, I finally converted them all to BTC ETH and LINK. I was happy with my amount of crypto and ready let it sit for years. But because I am greedy I wanted to gain some interest on it too, but I didn't trust Binance or other CEX's so was looking for a DEX. After researching Uniswap, Aave, Maker and others I found Bancor, which offered good APY and I ended up staking 90% of my crypto on there.

Idk if you are familiar with what happend to Bancor. I feel so stupid for trusting them but they were promising 100% Impermanent loss protection and were deemed as a blue chip defi by a large part of the crypto community, they actually build the first AMM and it was the go-to place to stake LINK. In my eyes they were as legit as it gets. I made some money staking my TKN's there but in summer 2022 whales where withdrawing so much that the 100% Impermanent loss protection which was compensated by printing BNT caused a huge BNT inflation, causing them to stop the ILP and forcing us to face impermanent losses worse than on other platforms, because they are socialized amongst all stakers. 

Despite this clear design flaw causing stakers facing 60%+ impermanent loss on ETH and BTC the Bancor foundation which raised $130M USD in the biggest ICO in crypto history refused to even comment on this situation let alone reimburse anyone, even tho the deficit was only about 1/5 of their ICO money. A few months later a disgruntled investor showed up at their office in Switzerland and threated them, only after that they made a statement saying they won't bail anyone out but they will fund development for 10 years to come. 1.5 years later the deficit is worse than it ever has been. The Bancor team is earning the ICO money while pretending to still try to alleviate the deficit but they actually just there to keep the show running and drain the ICO money. Team members who were against that and actually wanted to continue building got ousted. Recently they even said in the Telegram that they refuse to work on Bancor as long as the SEC lawsuit against Solana isn't settled and use that as an excuse to fully stop the marketing and development of the token, let alone even discuss potential features for it.

Almost all the unhappy people in the telegram got banned by now, just today someone got banned for replying to Mark Richardson, a guy who got put in charge by the foundation to solve this situation and failed miserably so far. Mark asked if the community thinks he should step down just to ban everyone who said yes. It is a shame what this project has turned into and it made me realize that no matter what they promise, no matter their references in the space, no matter if doxxed or not, if they want to scam you, they will find a way. I will take the haircut soon and try to work up my way from there again, I will be fine but it really sucks to lose 60% of your crypto this way. 

TLDR: Scammers from Bancor promised big and delivered low, causing me to to lose 60% of my crypto despite them promising 100% Protection. They were respected in the crypto space, fully doxxed, and still made me lose my money with their shitty DEX."

This scam just happened yesterday, a police report has been filed as well but they seem to be slow at responding. Bancor said they can't help because they are decentralized. I asked if they can freeze BNT assets, they said that ability was there in the early years but not anymore.

Any help which leads to an exchange freezing his funds and sent back will be rewarded 5k from the 30k returned. I lost my life savings, I don't have anything to pay upfront...

Bancor just unilaterally decided that they will not honor the BNT payout anymore. Sorry WTF. What is the point of trustless finance if a bunch of assholes keep backdoors open to just change whatever they want.

Sure, you could say my fault for not studying the smart contract source code back then, but come on. They are a fucking fraud and I call them out!"

So I did not receive what was promised, the BNT tokens to prevent the impermanent loss, when I withdrew.  


Today I accessed the webiste  ([bancor.network](https://bancor.network)) and I can not see the pools to provide liquidity anymore.   What happened ?

  
I lost a lot of money because Bancor changed the main protocol rule to prevent impermanent loss overnight.   All the pools go through a big deficit because of this.

So if there is any action I should take please let me know.

"Helping the above average John guy understand the Defi space : AMMs differences, risks and notable mentions(PancakeSwap and 0x Protocol)",CryptoCurrency,16vi7g2,2023-09-29 13:45:50,0,0.18,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16vi7g2/helping_the_above_average_john_guy_understand_the/,Natural_NoChemical,DISCUSSION,"**Ok John, let's talk about three important differences among these popular AMMs: Uniswap v2, Curve, Balancer, and Bancor :** 

1. **Pool Fees:** DEXs want people to add money to their pools, so they let those who do earn fees. These fees help protect against price changes and risks. Here's a quick overview of how these DEXs handle fees as of April 2021:  


* **Uniswap v2 and Curve:** They set a fixed fee for every trade, and all of it goes to the people who provide liquidity to the pool. The difference is that Uniswap gives all the fee to the liquidity providers, while Curve splits it evenly between providers and the platform.
* **Balancer and Bancor:** In these DEXs, the fees are not fixed; the pool creator decides them. It can be different for each pool they create, giving them more control.

So, the big difference is in how they handle these trading fees, with Uniswap and Curve being more straightforward, while Balancer and Bancor offer flexibility to pool creators.

2 .**Liquidity mining** is like planting seeds in a garden. Here's how it works: You provide your crypto tokens to a platform, and in return, they give you some of their special tokens. These special tokens are like rewards for helping out.  Each of the four DEXs has its own native token : UNI, CRV, BAL and BNT.

3. **Pool Weightage** : Most AMMs, like Uniswap and Bancor, have a standard rule where you need to provide an equal amount of two different tokens to add money to a pool. It's like mixing two ingredients in a recipe in equal parts.

But Balancer does things differently. On Balancer, you can set how much of each ingredient you want in the mix. For example, you could have 80% of one token and 20% of another in a pool. It's like customizing your recipe.

Now, Curve is even more unique. It doesn't stick to a fixed recipe like the others. Instead, it changes the mix based on how much of each ingredient people add. So, if more of one token gets added, it becomes a bigger part of the mix. It's like a recipe that adapts based on what's available in your kitchen.

For example, let's say there's a pool with three stablecoins: DAI, USDC, and USDT. Ideally, they should each be one-third of the mix. But at one point, USDC became the biggest part of the mix (almost 42%), while DAI was the smallest (around 25%). If you want to add your ingredients to this pool, you don't need all three stablecoins, you can use just one. This changes the mix based on what you add.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what are the risks that come with those?""** Here is your answer John :

1. **Price Slippage**: When you make a trade on an AMM, the price you get depends on the amount of tokens in the liquidity pool. If the pool has low liquidity (not many tokens), making big trades can cause the price to change a lot, and you end up paying more than you expected. Imagine trying to buy a lot of ice cream in a small shop; the more you buy, the higher the price goes.
2. **Front-running**: AMM trades are visible to everyone on the blockchain, so some people can see your trade and try to get in before you. They do this by paying higher fees to make their trades go first. It's like someone cutting in front of you in line at the store. This is called a ""Sandwich Attack.""
3. **Impermanent Loss**: This is a tricky one. When you provide your tokens to an AMM, the value of those tokens can change compared to just holding them in your wallet. This loss isn't real until you take your tokens out of the pool. For example, if you put 10,000 DAI and 5 ETH in a pool and ETH's price doubles, you might lose some money compared to just holding ETH in your wallet. But this loss only happens if you take your tokens out of the pool. So it's like deciding whether to keep your ice cream in a freezer (your wallet) or share it with others (the pool).

These risks can vary depending on the tokens you're trading. Some tokens are more stable, like stablecoins, so they have less risk of impermanent loss. But tokens with big price changes are riskier. It's like trading rare collectible toys (volatile tokens) vs. regular toys (stablecoins) ‚Äì the rare ones can be more rewarding but also riskier.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Only those AMMs exist?""** No John, here are 2 other notable mentions : 

1. **PancakeSwap**: Think of PancakeSwap as a sibling to Uniswap, but it lives on the Binance Smart Chain instead of Ethereum. It's like a popular ice cream shop in a different neighborhood. Even though it's newer, lots of people love it, and it had more trades than Uniswap in April 2021.
2. **0x Protocol**: This is like a tool that helps build decentralized exchanges. It has two main parts: one helps different projects create their own exchanges (like giving them ice cream recipes), and the other is a website called Matcha where people can easily trade different tokens from various exchanges. It's like a chef sharing their recipes, and many projects use these recipes to make their own ice cream shops.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***TL;DR :*** 

1. **Pool Fees**: AMMs differ in how they handle fees. Uniswap and Curve have fixed fees, fully for LPs or split with the platform. Balancer and Bancor let pool creators set fees.
2. **Liquidity Mining**: Like planting seeds for rewards. Each AMM has its own token: UNI, CRV, BAL, or BNT.
3. **Pool Weightage**: Most AMMs need equal parts of two tokens, but Balancer allows custom ratios, and Curve adjusts based on what users add.

Risks:

1. **Price Slippage**: Low liquidity can cause price changes on big trades.
2. **Front-running**: Others can copy your trade by paying higher fees.
3. **Impermanent Loss**: Your tokens' value changes compared to holding them.

Bonus AMMs:

1. **PancakeSwap**: Like Uniswap on Binance Smart Chain.
2. **0x Protocol**: Helps build decentralized exchanges, like sharing ice cream recipes for projects.

"Helping the above average John guy understand the Defi space : Uniswap, SushiSwap, Balancer, Curve Finance and Bancor. Also a recap on DEXs and AMMs.",CryptoCurrency,16v3et9,2023-09-29 01:51:23,26,0.77,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16v3et9/helping_the_above_average_john_guy_understand_the/,Natural_NoChemical,DISCUSSION,"**""So, what is a DEX exactly. I need a refresher after the pause we took.**"" Already forgot John? Not good : 

Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are like online marketplaces for trading cryptocurrencies. Traditionally, people used Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) for trading, but DEXs have become more popular. Here's why:

CEXs are like big banks for crypto, but they have some problems. First, they can get hacked, and people can lose their money. Second, the exchange can stop you from trading or taking out your money whenever they want.

DEXs are different. They let you trade cryptocurrencies directly with others without using a big exchange in the middle. This means you don't need to give a lot of personal information or follow strict rules. It's more like trading with a friend.

In recent years, DEXs have become a serious alternative to CEXs. They've grown a lot, and many people are using them because they offer more freedom and control over your assets.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what were the 2 main types of DEXs?""** Glad you remembered that there are 2 main ones John : 

1. **Order Book Based DEXs:** These work kind of like traditional exchanges. They have lists of buy and sell orders for different cryptocurrencies at different prices. Users can place orders at their preferred prices, just like in centralized exchanges (CEXs). But in DEXs, your assets are stored in your own wallet, not on the exchange. DEXs can have order books that are on-chain (recorded on the blockchain) or off-chain (recorded outside the blockchain).
2. **Liquidity Pool Based DEXs**: These DEXs use something called Liquidity Pools. Think of these pools as a collection of tokens sitting in smart contracts that users can trade with. Most Liquidity Pool DEXs use something called Automated Market Makers (AMM). AMMs are like mathematical robots that automatically set the prices of tokens based on a formula. They make trading available 24/7, provide better access to capital, and are pretty efficient. Some well-known AMM-based DEXs are Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve, Balancer, and Bancor. These became really popular during the DeFi boom in 2020.

 

&#x200B;

**""Could you give me a recap on Automated Market Makers (AMMs). I remember that we talked about Uniswap back then.""** Yes, we talked about that AMM. Here is a recap John : 

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are like the engines that power some decentralized exchanges, like Uniswap. Unlike regular exchanges, which have order books where people place buy and sell orders, AMMs work differently.

In AMMs, there are no order books. Instead, they use something called ""liquidity pools."" Imagine these pools as collections of tokens just waiting to be traded. For instance, if you want to exchange Ethereum (ETH) for DAI, you trade using the ETH/DAI liquidity pool. This pool holds both ETH and DAI tokens.

People who deposit their tokens into these pools are called ""Liquidity Providers"" (LPs). They add their tokens to the pool based on certain rules (usually an equal amount of each token). LPs do this because they can earn money from trading fees that users pay when they trade on the exchange.

The cool thing is, anyone can become an LP and help make trading happen in these pools. With AMMs, you don't need a big centralized exchange to provide liquidity. Instead, smart contracts automatically handle trades, including figuring out the trade prices. This is different from regular exchanges, where there are people or companies acting as intermediaries.

So, in short, AMMs make trading on decentralized exchanges smooth and automatic, without the need for middlemen. You can think of traditional exchanges as following a ""peer-to-peer"" model, while AMMs follow a ""peer-to-contract"" model.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What are the existing types of AMMs out there?""** As far as I know, 4 types :

1. **Constant Product Market Makers:** This formula, used by Uniswap and Bancor, is like a curved line on a graph. It works by multiplying the quantities of two tokens in a liquidity pool (x and y) to keep the product (k) constant. This creates a range of prices for the tokens. However, the prices can be unstable because large trades can significantly affect the price due to pool size. This can lead to something called ""impermanent loss.""
2. **Constant Sum Market Maker:** This formula creates a straight line on the graph, making it ideal for trades with zero slippage (smooth trading). However, it has a flaw: it can be exploited by arbitrageurs when the quoted price differs from the market price elsewhere. These arbitrageurs can drain the entire liquidity pool, leaving no liquidity for other traders. So, it's not suitable for most AMM uses.
3. **Constant Mean Market Maker:** Balancer popularized this formula, which is also known as the Value Function. It allows liquidity pools with more than two tokens and various token ratios beyond the standard 50/50 distribution. Instead of keeping the product constant, it maintains the weighted geometric mean constant. This enables variable exposure to different assets in the pool and allows swaps between any of the pool's assets.
4. **Stableswap Invariant:** Curve Finance introduced this formula, which is a hybrid of the Constant Product and Constant Sum formulas. It uses a Constant Sum curve when the portfolio is balanced and switches to a Constant Product curve when it's imbalanced. This minimizes slippage and impermanent loss, making it suitable for trading assets with similar values, like stablecoins.

In summary John, these different AMM formulas provide various ways to set token prices in liquidity pools. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so they are used in different situations depending on the type of assets being traded and the desired trading experience.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""How are prices determined on a Constant Product AMM?""** Here is your answer friend : 

I will use Uniswap for the example because we know more about it. 

1. **Constant Product Formula:** Uniswap uses a formula called the Constant Product Market Maker. This formula keeps the product of the reserve tokens (x and y) in the liquidity pool constant. The formula looks like this: x \* y = k, where:

* x represents one type of token in the pool.
* y represents the other type of token in the pool.
* k is the constant total liquidity that determines the token prices in the pool.

1. **Example:** Imagine there's a liquidity pool on Uniswap with 61,404,818 DAI and 26,832 ETH as of April 21, 2021. This means that the product (k) of the DAI and ETH reserves remains constant. Therefore, if you calculate the price of ETH in DAI, it would be 61,404,818 DAI / 26,832 ETH = 2,289 DAI for 1 ETH.
2. **Price Differences:** Now, here's the catch. The price you see on Uniswap for 1 ETH is 2,289 DAI. But if you check another exchange like Balancer and see that the price of ETH is 2,100 DAI, it creates an opportunity for arbitrage.
3. **Arbitrage:** Arbitrageurs are traders who take advantage of these price differences. They can buy ETH for a lower price on Balancer and then sell it on Uniswap for a higher price, making a quick profit (assuming no trading fees for simplicity). They keep doing this until the prices on both exchanges become equal.

In a nutshell, on Constant Product AMMs like Uniswap, prices change only when the balance of tokens in the liquidity pool changes. This can lead to price differences between different exchanges, and arbitrageurs exploit these differences to equalize prices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what are the various Automated Market Makers (AMMs)?""** That's actually a very good question John.

&#x200B;

 

***Let's start with the familiar one:*** **Uniswap** is like a special place on the Ethereum blockchain where you can easily trade one cryptocurrency for another without giving up control of your money. It started back in November 2018 and was one of the first to use a math formula called the Constant Product Market Maker. This formula helps figure out how much of one token you get when you trade another.

Uniswap got even cooler in May 2020 when it became Uniswap version 2. This new version let you trade lots of different Ethereum-based tokens, not just a few.

But the real excitement happened on May 5, 2021, when Uniswap released version 3. This version brought two big changes:

1. **Concentrated Liquidity:** Now, people who put money into Uniswap (we call them Liquidity Providers or LPs) can choose the price ranges where they want to provide their money. For example, if they're helping with the ETH/DAI trading, they can decide to focus on the $2,000 - $3,000 price range or the $1,500 - $1,700 range. This makes it more efficient for LPs, and they get special tokens (Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs) to show their position.
2. **Multiple Pool Fee Tiers:** Uniswap version 3 offers different fees for LPs to choose from:  


* 0.05% for pairs with stable prices (like USDC/DAI)
* 0.30% for pairs with more price changes (like ETH/DAI)
* 1.00% for pairs that are a bit more unusual.

So, depending on how much action a trading pair sees, LPs can pick the fee that suits them best. It's like choosing the right tool for the right job.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Now, let's take a look at SushiSwap :***  **SushiSwap** is like a sibling to Uniswap, but it has its own unique flavors. It was created in August 2020 by someone using the name Chef Nomi. At first, it was basically a copy of Uniswap's version 2, using the same math model called the Constant Product Market Maker.

What made SushiSwap stand out was its SUSHI token. This was before Uniswap had its own UNI token. SushiSwap attracted a lot of attention because it offered tasty rewards for people who joined its yield farming.

In September 2020, SushiSwap did something called a ""vampire attack"" on Uniswap. It basically sucked out a big chunk of Uniswap's money and moved it to SushiSwap. This made SushiSwap look like a big deal overnight, but Uniswap quickly bounced back.

Now, as of April 2021, SushiSwap has about $4.5 billion in money locked up, which is quite a lot but still less than Uniswap's $10.3 billion. Uniswap is like the big brother in the world of decentralized exchanges.

One cool thing about SushiSwap is that it joined forces with Yearn Finance, which is like a farming expert in the crypto world. Together, they offer more services and ways to make money.

When it comes to fees, both Uniswap and SushiSwap charge a 0.3% fee on trades. But SushiSwap gives 0.05% of that fee to its SUSHI token holders. Uniswap can do the same with its UNI token if people vote for it.

Uniswap has a lot more trading pairs, over 2,000 of them. That's like having more options on the menu. SushiSwap has fewer options, around 400 trading pairs.

Uniswap hangs out on Ethereum, but it plans to move to Layer 2 with Optimism. SushiSwap, on the other hand, is quite the traveler. It's on nine different blockchains, like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and others.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Let's see what da fuss is about with Balancer John :*** **Balancer** is like a manager for your crypto money. It's not just a regular exchange; it also helps you manage your investments. Instead of you paying fees to invest in a fund, people who put their money into Balancer's pools get paid when the fund is rebalanced. It's like getting a reward for being part of a club.

Unlike Uniswap, which works with only two types of crypto at a time, Balancer can handle multiple types at once. It's like having more options when you invest. Also, the people who create these pools can set their own fees, which can be really low or even high, giving them more control.

There are three types of Balancer pools:

1. **Public pools**: Anyone can join, and the rules can't be changed. This is the most secure option.
2. **Private pools**: Only the owner can change the rules and add money. It's a bit like a private club.
3. **Smart pools**: Anyone can join, and the rules can change over time. This is the most flexible option.

Balancer version 2 is even cooler because it can handle up to 16 different types of crypto in one pool. It's like having a big mixing pot for your money. These smart pools can also do things like automatically buying back tokens or lending out unused money to make more money.

Balancer also has a special way of launching new tokens called Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs). These are like short-lived pools where the token's price starts high and goes down slowly. This way, big investors can't just grab all the tokens at once, making it fairer for everyone. It's like selling concert tickets, but the prices get cheaper as time goes on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""You forgot Curve Finance!""** No, I did not : 

Curve Finance is like a special exchange that's really good at swapping similar things. In the world of crypto, there are different versions of the same stuff, like copies or wrappers. Curve Finance helps you trade these similar things easily.

It mainly works with stablecoins (which are like crypto dollars) and wrapped or synthetic versions of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, it has a big pool called 3CRV that holds stablecoins like DAI, USDT, and USDC. The amounts of these stablecoins in the pool change depending on what people want to trade. If there's more of one stablecoin, it's a chance for smart traders to make some quick money by balancing things out.

Curve Finance also deals with tokens that earn you money when you keep them. It works with tokens from Compound, Aave, and Yearn Finance. They made a special pool called yUSD that contains these earning tokens. People who join this pool can make money in three ways: from the earnings of the tokens, fees from trading on Curve, and rewards from Curve Finance.

To make it easier for people to trade not-so-popular tokens, Curve came up with something called base pools and metapools. A base pool is like a pool for one kind of token, and a metapool links it to another pool. This makes it simple for users to swap that one token. The most popular base pool is 3CRV. Making metapools helps Curve do a few things: it keeps their main pools strong, allows them to trade less popular tokens, and brings in more fees for people who own CRV tokens.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***I bet that you did not hear about our last candidate :*** **Bancor** is like an exchange that works in a different way compared to others. It was one of the first of its kind, starting in 2017. It uses something called an AMM system, just like Uniswap, but with a twist.

Instead of swapping any token for any other token like Uniswap, Bancor uses its special coin called Bancor Network Token (BNT) as the go-between. It has separate pools for each token that you want to trade using BNT.

Bancor version 2 introduced some cool stuff like letting people put in just one type of token instead of two when they add to the pool. This makes it easier for them to keep all their money in one type of token while still earning money from fees and rewards.

They also tackle something called ""impermanent loss,"" which is a risk that people worry about when they provide money to these pools. Bancor makes it less scary by promising to cover these losses for pool providers. But you need to stick around for at least 100 days to get the full benefit, with a 30-day wait before it starts.

Bancor also has some extra things like vBNT and Vortex. When you put your BNT in a special pool, you get vBNT, which can be used for voting on how Bancor works, earning fees, or even borrowing other tokens using your vBNT as collateral. It's like getting extra powers for your BNT tokens.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What are the differentiators between the AMMs bud?""** Slow down John. This is enough for the moment. I will come back later with some more info regarding this topic. Untill then, please understand what we have just talked about here.

Osmosis Zone, built on the Cosmos ecosystem, offers a unique take on automated market making and decentralized exchange. With its focus on liquidity pools and yield farming, Osmosis has gained attention for its potential to empower users to create and manage their own tokenized assets.

**16. PancakeSwap (CAKE)**

PancakeSwap, a prominent DeFi project on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offers users a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform similar to Uniswap but with lower fees due to BSC's network characteristics. Its ability to provide liquidity, yield farming, and other DeFi services has made it a popular choice within the BSC ecosystem.

Remember, the DeFi space is a tad bit chaotic at times and certainly very dynamic, new projects are emerging regularly. This ranking is based on the information available to my stupid Australian brain up to this point in 2023 and will most likely change. DYOR and use this maybe as a guide, or not."

"There and back again, how an extremely profitable trade turned into a worthless pile of dust.",CryptoCurrency,14sdebk,2023-07-06 11:58:44,23,0.71,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14sdebk/there_and_back_again_how_an_extremely_profitable/,jonfoxsaid,PERSPECTIVE,"Right before the start of the last bull run I had fallen ass backwards into more than a few profitable trades and airdrops, one of them being [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) which I sadly sold off right away.

As much as I regret that, one thing that came from it was an introduction to liquidity mining [via the whole Sushiswap vampire attack on Uniswap](https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/).

Along with [Uni](https://uniswap.org/) and [Sushi](https://www.sushi.com/) I had been looking at other [Decentralized exchanges](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-and-how-do-dexs-work).  One I had been looking into was [Bancor](https://bancor.network/), they had announced a new [liquidity mining program](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/liquidity-mining/) that I wanted to take part in but I was nervous to risk a lot of money in it.

After taking profits on a few trades I was feeling good and decided that opening a small position with some of my profits first to test the waters was the best plan of action because the interest rates where so high that if it did work out I could actually make some money on even a small amount and if I lost it, its nothing I would loose sleep over.

# What is [liquidity mining](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/liquidity-mining/) ?

Liquidity mining is kind of similar to staking or lending out our crypto in a [smart contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) but much riskier.

You start out [providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-pools/) like [Uniswap](https://www.uniswap.com), [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/), [Curve](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/curve-finance-liquidity-provider-dao), [Balancer](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-balancer-automated-market-maker-amm-defi) or [Bancor](https://bancor.network/).  Obviously there are many many more but I am not going to list them all, these are some of the more popular ones.

Traditionally when you enter a liquidity pool you provide two tokens (although this is not always the case anymore), in this post we will use ETH x DAI for an example.

You provide an equal amount of each coin initially but as the market moves your coins will shift, think of it like a scale going back and forth.  The big thing you need to look out for is [impermanent loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/) (more on that later).

When I opened this position [double sided liquidity pools](https://blog.bancor.network/bancor-liquidity-pools-101-reserve-weights-e0268548ad1c) where the thing and [Bancor's gimmick was that you would never suffer impermanent loss in their pools.  BNT (their native token) was used to make liquidity providers whole should they exit the pool with less than they entered with.](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/bancor/)

[When you first open your position you normally receive LP tokens that](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens-and-how-do-they-work) represents the pool you have a stake in and while things work differently on Bancor now (although I guess it may still be considered an LP token just more complicated), at the time this was true.

To earn rewards from liquidity mining you then stake your LP tokens in a smart contract.

So basically it is like simply staking a token but instead of just a token your putting up your position in a liquidity pool and you remain exposed to that liquidity pool, for better or worse.  You are also still earning your share of the fees on top of the interest from staking.

# What is [impermanent loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/) ?

The issue, as I stated above is [impermanent loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/).  I am not going to deep dive on how decentralized exchanges work but I have linked plenty of articles throughout this post for the people who would like to read more.  Below I will give two simple examples of what can happen.

&#x200B;

* Say your providing ETHxDAI and right after you join the pool ETH starts tanking hard.  Your position will start to weigh very heavy on DAI and the faster it falls the lower the eth in your pool sells for.  This can obviously lead to you ending up with much less than you actually entered the pool with unless you can wait long enough for eth to start climbing back up and hopefully above the price you entered at.

&#x200B;

* [In this second example we will talk about a much more dangerous scenario ... Shit coins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp).  If you decide to enter a pool of ETHxSHIT because shit is all the rage lately and ShitDex is offering 2000% APY you might find yourself asking what can go wrong with that kind of return!  First, like in our previous scenario if SHIT token tanks your position will start filling up on SHIT only in this scenario it is very likely that SHIT may never increase in value again making your impermanent loss very permanent.  In fact, it is not uncommon for people holding high risk positions like this to check on their position after a rug pull only to find all they have left is SHIT token which is now worth jack SHIT.  What about the rewards ?  Most of the time LM rewards are paid in the native token of the platform which is how they can afford to give these insane returns.

The idea with these positions is that you make enough from the rewards and fees that you never care about impermanent loss but the riskier the position the less likely this becomes to actually happen, it is not uncommon for platforms to come out of nowhere, completely unheard of and offering APY in the thousands.  They can do this because what they are giving you is a token they created out of thin air, [alot of times these may be governance tokens which allow you to vote on the future of the platform](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-governance-tokens-and-how-do-they-work) but if the platform [rugs and the token goes bust](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-rug-pulls-what-is-a-rug-pull-in-crypto-and-6-ways-to-spot-it) you end up holding the bag.  This is not to shit on governance tokens entirely, there are plenty of governance tokens that are great ... it just happens to also be a thing that is often used to scam people because it is extremely easy to create and sell.

[Sushiswap did this before they went on to become the platform they have today but that is a whole other story in its own](https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/), they are now a reputable platform but they almost went down as one of the most infamous rug pulls in history.  You may ask why people would ever willingly do this and the real answer is that a lot of people who take on these high risk LM positions realize it is a scam/rug or at least a very high risk of being that and just want to earn as much as they can and then pull out before it all comes crashing down. They are taking a gamble because if you can manage to pull out and sell before the hype dies and the token price crashes or the platform rugs, you can make a lot of money BUT you should never attempt to do this with money you can not afford to loose.

When it comes to reputable DEX's there are also a lot of different strategies one can implement to help mitigate impermanent loss such as using two tokens that tend to move in the same direction or entering during a planned period of time and attempting to ride out a curve although this is obviously NEVER a sure thing because if it was we would all be rich.

Also I should add that there have been other advancements one of the bigger ones being [Uniswap's pools that allow you to accept swaps only at certain price ranges.](https://medium.com/coinmonks/uniswap-v3-explained-57e0cdf86719)

# We return to our regularly scheduled program

So I had decided to test out Bancor, they where far from the unknown platforms I spoke about before.[They had been around since the start and still are today and where actually the first exchange to implement an AMM](https://messari.io/asset/bancor/profile).  They where not offering thousands of percent APY but they where offering over 100% although I cant remember exactly how high it was.  I decided to enter BNTxLINK with $200 worth on each side and a plan to add more if I still liked it in a few months.

When I entered BNT was about .80 USD and I think [LINK](https://www.investopedia.com/chainlink-link-definition-5217559) was somewhere around $12,  I was a strong believer in Link (still am) but what I was really banking on is that BNT would explode like it did last cycle (chart below) and I would score big since rewards where paid in BNT as well.

I ended up being right  and I honestly gained so much value that I never added more to the position.  At the height of  the bull run my position was worth about $4500 less than a year after opening it.

[This is where I fucked up.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fucked%20up)

I was hyped on the release of [Bancor 3](https://blog.bancor.network/introducing-bancor-3-962a3c601c25) and that combined with [ETH gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) costing the price of a ps5 [I decided to cancel my exit strategy.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exitstrategy.asp)  This is the only time I have done this and I will never do it again.  I decided to do this when BNT was at its height but of course I did not know that then or I would have pulled out like a virgin on prom night.

This was a huge mistake as I also became emotionally invested in this trade going forward, the price kept sinking and Bancor kept failing.  I think the only project I have ever seen with more delays is [Pi, yeah the free one that you mine with your phone.](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/pi/)

By the time I started to come around my position was down to about $1,000 and by the time Bancor 3 came out it was even less.

[Bancor 3 brought in a lot of new changes but one of the big ones was single sided liquidity for liquidity pools](https://docs.bancor.network/about-bancor-network/faqs/single-side-liquidity), This single sided liquidity also still had the same protection from impermanent loss and all swaps would also now be able to [take place in a single transaction](https://blog.bancor.network/introducing-bancor-3-962a3c601c25) which was huge for fees.  It is still like this now and while they have done a lot of work to recover and keep things rolling I am sure most users have the same sour taste in their mouth as me.

Shortly after Bancor 3 went live [the FTX debacle happened](https://www.investopedia.com/what-went-wrong-with-ftx-6828447) which destroyed the price of BNT to the point where [Bancor stepped in and paused BNT distribution which meant that people withdrawing their funds would in fact suffer from impermanent loss which was the whole thing Bancor was claiming to stop](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bancor-pauses-impairment-loss-protection-citing-hostile-market-conditions).  This of course caused more panic and large holders still chose to withdraw even though they would suffer massive losses beyond just dollar value.

As you can imagine this did nothing good at all for the platform and my position is now actually worth less than it was when I entered and I am at more than a 50% loss on BNT even though I have almost 4x the amount of BNT in the pool than I did when I started.

I actually never lost on my [LINK](https://www.investopedia.com/chainlink-link-definition-5217559) as I got it so cheap, the [LINK](https://www.investopedia.com/chainlink-link-definition-5217559) I put in the pool had first been purchased when it was around $2.50 and swing traded many times making the actual cost even less than that as I had taken profits on it several times before entering the pool [far exceeding my cost basis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp).  When Bancor V3 released I only transferred my BNT since dual sided liquidity was no longer a requirement.

They have since enabled BNT distribution and Bancor lives on today although they have now geo restricted the United States which can easily be circumvented with a VPN although US users are supposed to be only able to withdraw.

I will continue to hold my position because obviously its not worth the gas it would cost to exit it, might as well just let it go and ~~hold on to it~~  HODL in case they make an immaculate recovery, even so shit tends to rise with water so who knows.

Below is a weekly chart I provided so you can see how BNT has performed over the years, I entered  my BNTxLINK position just before that first leg up during the last cycle.

**T.L.D.R -  I made a pretty awesome return on a small amount invested in a liquidity pool but failed to take profits resulting in me actually losing money.  I also discuss liquidity pools, decentralized exchanges and Liquidity mining while providing tons and tons of links for anyone wishing to read more.**

Fringe Finance has just announced [the upcoming launch of its v2](https://fringefinance.medium.com/road-to-v2-an-updated-fringe-finance-roadmap-b242b3eaa85a), a major upgrade to its DeFi lending platform. With this update, Bancor token holders will now have access to a suite of new features and opportunities besides the ability to borrow against their tokens.

Here's what you can expect in Fringe Finance v2:

* A lending/borrowing market for a wide range of crypto assets
* Partial liquidations for more flexible loan management
* Atomic loan repayments for simplified transactions
* Multi-asset lender tokens for diversified lending options
* Multi-chain support for seamless lending on various chains 
* LP token support for lending backed by liquidity pool tokens
* Improved interest rate model for enhanced capital efficiency

After building through the bear market, Fringe seems ready to continue to push the boundaries of DeFi lending. With an ambitious roadmap that includes a truly decentralized stablecoin, a new oracle model, leveraged trading, and much more.   
Check out the announcement: [https://fringefinance.medium.com/road-to-v2-an-updated-fringe-finance-roadmap-b242b3eaa85a](https://fringefinance.medium.com/road-to-v2-an-updated-fringe-finance-roadmap-b242b3eaa85a)

Borrowing USDC with ZRX: A Guide,fringefinanceapp,yv1jeg,2022-11-14 09:47:40,9,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fringefinanceapp/comments/yv1jeg/borrowing_usdc_with_zrx_a_guide/,crypto-konstantin,,"Fringe Finance, an all-new and inclusive DeFi lending platform, saw the integration of $ZRX as a collateral type into its Primary Lending Platform (PLP). With Fringe‚Äôs PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $ZRX holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we‚Äôve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with 0x Protocol tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $OCEAN (Ocean Protocol)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $ZRX (0x Token)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $FXS (Frax Share)
* $UNI (Uniswap)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $DODO (DODO)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

**Here‚Äôs how it works:** 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe‚Äôs PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset‚Äôs maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset‚Äôs loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $ZRX current LVR in Fringe‚Äôs PLP is 51% ‚Äî depositing $1000 worth of $ZRX allows a user to borrow up to 510 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $ZRX increases in value. This means that any gains from your $ZRX position are entirely yours. If your $ZRX drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $ZRX plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is the 0x Protocol?

0x is an infrastructure protocol that allows users to easily trade ERC20 tokens and other assets on the Ethereum blockchain without relying on centralized intermediaries like traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.

## How to borrow USDC with ZRX on Fringe Finance

With Fringe‚Äôs PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $SNX holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we‚Äôve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with Synthetix tokens.

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $REN (Ren Protocol)

* $GTC (Gitcoin)
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

**Here‚Äôs how it works:** 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe‚Äôs PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset‚Äôs maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset‚Äôs loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $SNX current LVR in Fringe‚Äôs PLP is 51% ‚Äî depositing $1000 worth of $SNX allows a user to borrow up to 510 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $SNX increases in value. This means that any gains from your $SNX position are entirely yours. If your $SNX drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $SNX plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is Synthetix Network?

Synthetix is a DeFi protocol that gives users on-chain access to a diverse range of crypto and non-crypto assets. The system, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain, provides users with access to highly liquid synthetic assets (synths). Synths track and offer returns on the underlying asset without requiring the asset to be held directly.

The platform‚Äôs goal is to widen the bitcoin ecosystem by incorporating non-blockchain assets, allowing users to get access to a more robust financial market.

## What is Wrapped Ethereum?

$wETH is an ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Ether ($ETH). $wETH has a wider range of use cases than $ETH and is incredibly popular in the DeFi ecosystem. It‚Äôs also issued by a decentralized smart contract, so it does not have a centralized issuer like other wrapped tokens.

Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum ‚Äî you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.

With Fringe‚Äôs PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $OCEAN holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we‚Äôve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with Ocean Protocol tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $OCEAN (Ocean Protocol)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $FXS (Frax Share)
* $UNI (Uniswap)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $DODO (DODO)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

**Here‚Äôs how it works:** 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe‚Äôs PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset‚Äôs maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset‚Äôs loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $OCEAN current LVR in Fringe‚Äôs PLP is 52% ‚Äî depositing $1000 worth of $OCEAN allows a user to borrow up to 520 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $OCEAN increases in value. This means that any gains from your $OCEAN position are entirely yours. If your $OCEAN drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $OCEAN plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is the Ocean Protocol?

Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that enables both individuals and companies to effortlessly monetize their data through the use of ERC-20-compliant data tokens.

Ocean Protocol is governed by a Singapore-based non-profit foundation, whose mandate is to ensure open access to the protocol and platform, provide data governance, encourage the network ecosystem growth, and take measures to ensure that the platform becomes ever more decentralized with time.

Borrowing USDC with DODO: A Guide,fringefinanceapp,yv0i0b,2022-11-14 09:10:06,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fringefinanceapp/comments/yv0i0b/borrowing_usdc_with_dodo_a_guide/,crypto-konstantin,,"Fringe Finance, an all-new and inclusive DeFi lending platform, saw the integration of $DODO as a collateral type into its Primary Lending Platform (PLP). With Fringe‚Äôs PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $DODO holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we‚Äôve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with DODO tokens.

## How do $DODO Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $DODO (DODO)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $APE (Ape Coin)

Here‚Äôs how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe‚Äôs PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset‚Äôs maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset‚Äôs loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $DODO current LVR in Fringe‚Äôs PLP is 50% ‚Äî depositing $1000 worth of $DODO allows a user to borrow up to 500 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $DODO increases in value. This means that any gains from your $DODO position are entirely yours. If your $DODO drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $DODO plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is DODO?

With Fringe‚Äôs PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $FOX holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we‚Äôve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with FOX tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $SAND (Sandbox)

Here‚Äôs how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe‚Äôs PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset‚Äôs maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset‚Äôs loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $FOX current LVR in Fringe‚Äôs PLP is 44% ‚Äî depositing $1000 worth of $FOX allows a user to borrow up to 440 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $FOX increases in value. This means that any gains from your $FOX position are entirely yours. If your $FOX drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $FOX plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is FOX?

[ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/) is a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014. After being pressured by regulations to add KYC requirements in 2018, ShapeShift decided to transition into a KYC-less self-custodial DEX with zero fees. Shapeshift works as a DEX aggregator, selecting the DEX route that costs the least to the user. Its platform also features an interface to access and control DeFi investments, and integration with fiat on-ramps such as JunoPay, Banxa, and GEM.

Shapeshift also runs [CoinCap.io](http://coincap.io/), a cryptocurrency market data platform, and KeepKey, a cryptocurrency hardware wallet. $FOX is ShapeShift‚Äôs governance token, controlling the ShapeShift DAO and offering liquidity farming opportunities.
