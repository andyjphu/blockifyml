Unlocking the Future of Crypto: The AI Framework Revolution,u_Glad_Double_4599,1i995x1,2025-01-24 18:24:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Glad_Double_4599/comments/1i995x1/unlocking_the_future_of_crypto_the_ai_framework/,Glad_Double_4599,,"Introduction  
As we delve deeper into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is buzzing with innovations, particularly in the realm of AI integration. Among the myriad of projects, $VOYAGE stands out as a beacon of potential, drawing attention not just for its technological prowess but also for its strategic positioning in the AI crypto space. Let's explore how $VOYAGE is setting sail to revolutionize crypto analysis and trading.  
The Dawn of AI in Crypto: Why It Matters  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a game-changer across industries, and cryptocurrency trading is no exception. AI-driven frameworks offer predictive analytics, automate trading strategies, and enhance decision-making processes, providing traders with a significant edge. The integration of AI into crypto platforms like $VOYAGE isn't just about hype; it's about tangible utility that could redefine how we interact with digital assets.  
$VOYAGE: More Than Just Another Token  
$VOYAGE isn't just another cryptocurrency; it's the backbone of an innovative AI agent framework designed specifically for crypto analysis. Here's what makes $VOYAGE a promising contender:

* Flexibility with Multiple AI Providers: Unlike other frameworks that might lock you into one AI model, $VOYAGE supports multiple AI providers. This flexibility ensures that users can switch between different AI models based on performance, cost, or specific needs, leading to more dynamic and tailored analysis.
* Customizable AI Personalities: Imagine an AI that not only analyzes data but does so with a personality tailored to your trading style or risk appetite. Whether you need a conservative, aggressive, or balanced approach, $VOYAGE's AI agents can adapt, providing personalized insights that align with your investment strategy.
* Transparency and Development: With a transparent development process highlighted by public GitHub repositories and led by ex-Amazon developers, $VOYAGE showcases a commitment to open-source innovation and credibility in its tech stack. This move not only builds trust but also invites community participation in its evolution.

Comparing with Peers: GRIFTAIN and GRIFT  
While $VOYAGE has its unique offerings, let's put it in context with other notable players like GRIFTAIN and GRIFT:

* GRIFTAIN: Known for its robust security features and AI-driven fraud detection, GRIFTAIN has carved a niche in safeguarding user transactions. However, where GRIFTAIN focuses on security, $VOYAGE emphasizes on trading efficiency and market analytics.
* GRIFT: Often criticized for its speculative nature and less focus on actual utility, GRIFT serves as a reminder of the importance of substance over hype. $VOYAGE, in contrast, is building a foundation of real utility, aiming to be more than just another speculative token.

The Market Impact of $VOYAGE  
The market cap of $VOYAGE, currently hovering around the 5 million mark, might seem modest, but its rapid development and consistent product updates since December 2024 suggest a project with significant growth potential. The launch of its own AI agent framework is a testament to its commitment to pioneering within the crypto ecosystem.  
Why You Should Keep an Eye on $VOYAGE

* Innovation at its Core: $VOYAGE isn't just riding the AI wave; it's shaping it. Its approach to integrating AI with crypto trading tools is innovative and forward-thinking.
* Community and Marketing: With a marketing strategy that rivals more established tokens like $ALCH, $VOYAGE is building not just a product but a community of enthusiasts and traders.
* Potential for Growth: Given its tech advancements and the niche it's carving, $VOYAGE could very well be one of the undervalued gems in the crypto market, much like how GRIFTAIN was before its mainstream adoption.

Conclusion  
In a market flooded with speculative tokens, $VOYAGE stands out by offering real utility through its AI framework. As we look towards the future, $VOYAGE isn’t just another journey; it’s a voyage into a new era of crypto trading enhanced by AI. Whether you're a seasoned trader or a crypto novice, keeping an eye on $VOYAGE could very well be a wise move as we navigate through the evolving seas of blockchain technology.  
Note: Always do your own research before investing. The insights here are based on current trends and should be taken with informed caution.

Overall, I’m seeking advice on how best to set this list up. I’ve gone through many reworks, most recently I’ve applied The Cube Theory to my list. I’m also painfully aware that I likely need to include Deadly Rolick and Tear Asunder for the sake of stronger removal. Toxic Deluge is a card I do have that I’m considering mainboarding. As for my overall plan? My mind gears towards utilizing Lathril as much as possible. Use her potential for early damage and find ways to make her unblockable, use her to generate numbers, use mass untap mechanics to utilize her final ability as much as possible. Contingencies like going wide in place, having enough mass protection spells and mass recursion. As for my list? Call it as budget CEDH as I possibly can get it, lol. Also, as I was just recently informed, I know that Lathril isn’t CEDH material. That isn’t stopping me from wanting to make her as good as possible. However, I do note that my creature base is lacking compared to what I aimed for previously. Which was balancing my number of creatures with my total number of other pieces. Maybe I’m trying to do too much? The sideboard is another thing I’m going crazy over too. Help.

"$20🌳Omnanth, All In On Green💵[Ultra Budget Mono Green Voltron]",BudgetBrews,1i663uf,2025-01-20 19:42:36,69,0.98,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetBrews/comments/1i663uf/20omnanth_all_in_on_greenultra_budget_mono_green/,Keirabella999,$15 Brew,"[\\""Your Elemental Power is Green!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/97v72bm4n8ee1.jpg?width=672&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79b5a0e8ce6d32dc52862c6f474d69f1e30d6f71)

Here's a build I had requested multiple times. I finally got around to finishing the deck but its budget is higher than I expected! Omnath lets us keep all of our unspent mana allowing us to make him bigger while sitting on a handful of protection spells for Omnath. With the rest of our mana we are going to lean into a budget enchantress package.

[RAMP](https://preview.redd.it/ird6w1nmn8ee1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d304c8692766f22212f45675e4af21fc92c007)

Ramp is power. The mana dorks here give us typical ramp but can always be used as pump for our commander. \[\[Whisperer of the Wilds\]\] and \[\[Illysian Caratid\]\] both make 2 mana if we control a 4 power creature. \[\[Karametra's Acolyte\]\] gives us even more mana if we have high Devotion while \[\[Frontier Siege\]\] gives us 2 mana during each of our main phases. We're also running a few enchantments that produce extra mana when we tap our lands with \[\[Wolfwillow Haven\]\], \[\[Wild Growth\]\], \[\[Fertile Ground\]\], and \[\[Overgrowth\]\]. These pair well with a few of our effects to untap a land each turn with \[\[Voyaging Satyr\]\], or all our lands with \[\[Wilderness Reclamation\]\] and \[\[Early Harvest\]\]. Also shout out to \[\[Urban Burgeoning\]\] which untaps on everybody's upkeep gaining us at least 3 mana a round or more if its also been enchanted.

[TRAMPLE](https://preview.redd.it/ce2bp2t2p8ee1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c7d13e533d4be8a595cebc17ed97c52b6b04ab2)

We're running six Cantrips that give Omanth Trample and a little power. \[\[Cliffhaven Kitesail\]\] gives a creature Flying while \[\[Glorious Sunrise\]\] gives Trample or makes mana. \[\[Scepter pf Celebration\]\] gives +2/+0 and Trample but also makes 1/1 Citizen tokens equal to the damage dealt.

[GO TALL](https://preview.redd.it/ifxiz68vp8ee1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f1a380b2e8a0d0ee7d2205b2d3b07f1b6bec970)

\[\[Innocuous Researcher\]\] and \[\[Shriekwood Devourer\]\] untap all of our lands letting us grow Omnath. \[\[FireShrieker\]\] is luckily a budget card that we can muster up to offer Doublestrike. Both \[\[Giant Inheritance\]\] and \[\[Gigantiform\]\] make Omnath bigger and give Trample. \[\[Forgotten Ancient\]\] gets a +1/+1 Counter each time our opponents cast a spell and then it can put those counters on our commander. \[\[Tanuki Transplanter\]\] gives us mana equal to the equipped creatures power making us basically double Omanth on each attack.  Lastly here is \[\[Exponential Growth\]\] and \[\[Choose Your Weapon\]\] doubling Omnath's power for the turn.

[PROTECTION](https://preview.redd.it/5x74ns06r8ee1.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4062f05f70faa90fbe5c0d5ca4039a9628050ed)

All in on Green. We need to protect Omnath or we are set back more than usual. These offer a range of protection, mostly at instant speed. We can cast these whenever by just lowering Omnath's power. A few like \[\[Snake Umbra\]\] and \[\[Boar Umbra\]\] also give Omnath Totem Armor.

[DISRUPTION](https://preview.redd.it/sjewtv6jr8ee1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1cca387cdffc6325f94f7efc2c726a8b7a19c1b)

Omnath is feeling scrappy. We're running a bunch of Fight effects letting us leverage our commanders power to remove problems and slow down our opponents. \[\[Windswift Slice\]\] makes us 1/1 elves equal to the excess damage we deal in a fight making us a boat load of tokens. \[\[Hunter's Talent\]\] is a Fight, Trample enabler, and Draw power built into one. \[\[Curse of the Werefox\]\], \[\[Cartouche of Strength\]\], and \[\[Nature's Way\]\] all fight and give Omnath Trample. \[\[Ezuri's Predation\]\] is busted as always :) Oh! Also \[\[Hurricane\]\] to just dump Omnath's power and wipe everyone out.

[DRAW DIG SEARCH](https://preview.redd.it/z7ewikbbs8ee1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f1448c266c672523dd7073d5a1245c01488803)

We're running some budget Enchantress creatures with \[\[Tanglespan Lookout\]\] and \[\[Elvish Archivist\]\]. \[\[Abzan Beastmaster\]\] and \[\[Family's Favor\]\] with both draw us a card each turn. \[\[Soul's Majesty\]\] \[\[Hunter's Insight\]\], and \[\[Hunter's Prowess\]\] can help us draw a huge amount of cards digging for ways to make Omnath more threatening.

As always let me know what you guys think of the build. I have sooooooo many decks on moxfield halfway or partially built but not a ton finalized yet. Let me know which commander you'd like to see in a Ultra Budget :D

"Trump vs. Melania Token War: At This Rate, We Might Actually Send Him to the Moon",WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i5ly9n,2025-01-20 03:48:40,7,0.68,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1i5ly9n/trump_vs_melania_token_war_at_this_rate_we_might/,Fresh-Feedback-7090,Meme,"# Have you ever asked yourself: “Could this timeline get any weirder?”

Because apparently, *Donald Trump* launched **$TRUMP**, *Melania Trump* said can i have one and launched **$MELANIA**, and crashed $TRUMP with ridiculous gains—like **thousands of percent** in a single day. I didn’t think 2025 could top any prior meme mania, but here we are!

So, here’s the **absurd** part:

1. **Trump** was already past $69+ (maybe more who is counting or time I finish typing?), and **Melania** soared something like **+22,000%** in 24 hours. Is that even real? I have no clue.
2. The **inauguration** is in less than **9 hours**—because what better time to pump meme tokens than right before you’re sworn in again?
3. Some folks are apparently **donating** for a literal “**Send Trump to the Moon**” crowdfund. And with the way the markets are going, *Mars* might be an option soon.

# Why Did I Make a Website?

* **I’m not the token dev**: I’m just a random onlooker who said, “This is too insane to ignore.” So, I slapped together a site to track these tokens’ prices and volumes side by side (complete with rocket GIFs, a big battle meter, and random Trump quotes for comedic effect).
* It’s called **“Trump to the Moon”** but I’m basically just charting the chaos. The fact that the man and his wife minted rival tokens is prime reality-TV gold—**someone** had to build a scoreboard, right?

# Peak 2025 or the Next Big Meme?

Let’s be real: crypto is no stranger to bizarre coins (DOGE, Shiba, Garfield? Did that exist?). But a *spousal rivalry* coin war, launched in the lead-up to an inauguration, might be the boldest twist yet.

And at the rate these tokens are “going to the moon,” who’s to say in another few days we won’t have enough money to rent out a few seats on the next SpaceX rocket? Or maybe funnel it into “Project **$ELON** \#45”— **Mars** is only the next planet over, after all.

# Check It Out (For LOLs)

* The site: \[[TrumpToTheMoon.lol\]](https://trumptothemoon.lol/) — it’s basically a carnival of rocket emojis, pink vs. red bars showing which token is “winning,” and a countdown to the big event.
* If you’re bored of normal price charts, watching this spectacle might restore your faith in how weird crypto can be.

# But Are You Actually Sending Him to Space??

* *Look,* if we keep getting these insane token gains, who’s to say what’s possible in 2025? The Singularity is near, AI is running half our social media, and now we have multiple rocket companies.
* In all seriousness, the site’s “Moon Mission” donations are…well, comedic. But in a world where meme coins have financed all sorts of stunts, who knows?

# Obligatory Disclaimer

1. **I am not** Trump’s official campaign manager, nor am I guaranteeing a literal lunar (or Martian) voyage. (Though if Elon reads this, hey—DM me?)
2. All contributions/donations are **non-refundable** and mostly used for comedic “campaign” antics.
3. This is **not financial advice**. The tokens are as volatile as they come, so if you’re considering diving in, be ready to watch your portfolio ride the world’s wildest roller coaster.
4. We can’t promise you a seat on a rocket, but we *can* promise top-tier memes.

# Final Thoughts

If you told me in 2019 that in 2025 we’d have a **Trump vs. Melania token battle** culminating in an actual attempt to rocket him to the cosmos, I’d have told you that’s an SNL sketch. Now it’s *real life*, and I’m both confused and thoroughly entertained.

**Check out the site if you want a front-row seat** to what might be the weirdest crypto event of the decade. And if the tokens keep pumping, maybe the next post will be from orbit. Godspeed, internet.

—  
**TL;DR**: There’s a $TRUMP token, a $MELANIA token, insane price gains, and a now a comedic “Send Trump to the Moon” donation bar.

I built a site to track it because we might as well embrace the absurdity. Meme responsibly, folks!

Salesforce AI Research Introduced CodeXEmbed (SFR-Embedding-Code): A Code Retrieval Model Family Achieving #1 Rank on CoIR Benchmark and Supporting 12 Programming Languages,machinelearningnews,1i4rofm,2025-01-19 00:48:03,14,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/comments/1i4rofm/salesforce_ai_research_introduced_codexembed/,ai-lover,Cool Stuff,"Researchers at Salesforce AI Research introduced CodeXEmbed, a family of open-source embedding models specifically designed for code and text retrieval. These models, released in three sizes, SFR-Embedding-Code-400M\_R, SFR-Embedding-Code-2B\_R, and 7 billion parameters, address various programming languages and retrieval tasks. CodeXEmbed’s innovative training pipeline integrates 12 programming languages and transforms five distinct code retrieval categories into a unified framework. By supporting diverse tasks such as text-to-code, code-to-text, and hybrid retrievals, the model expands the boundaries of what retrieval systems can achieve, offering unprecedented flexibility and performance.

CodeXEmbed employs an innovative approach that transforms code-related tasks into a unified query-and-answer framework, enabling versatility across various scenarios. Text-to-code retrieval maps natural language queries to relevant code snippets, streamlining tasks like code generation and debugging. Code-to-text retrieval generates explanations and summaries of code, enhancing documentation and knowledge sharing. Hybrid retrieval integrates text and code data, effectively addressing complex queries requiring technical and descriptive insights. The model’s training leverages contrastive loss to optimize query-answer alignment while reducing irrelevant data influence. Advanced techniques like low-rank adaptation and token pooling boost efficiency without sacrificing performance.

In tests, it has been evaluated across various benchmarks. On the CoIR benchmark, a comprehensive code retrieval evaluation dataset covering 10 subsets and over 2 million entries, the 7-billion parameter model achieved a performance improvement of more than 20% compared to the previous state-of-the-art Voyage-Code model. Notably, the 400-million and 2-billion parameter models also outperformed Voyage-Code, demonstrating the architecture’s scalability across different sizes. Also, CodeXEmbed excelled in text retrieval tasks, with the 7-billion parameter model achieving an average score of 60 on the BEIR benchmark, a suite of 15 datasets covering diverse retrieval tasks such as question answering and fact-checking........

\*\*Memory transcription subject:\*\* Governess of the Skalgan Republic Tarva.



\*\*Location:\*\* Dayside City Governor Manor.



\*\*Date:\*\* \[12 July 4036 S.T.T.\]



\*\*Status:\*\* Concerned and slightly irritated.



/——————————-/



“Madame Governess, please, for the last time, we need to attack before THEY attack first.”



I swear, despite Kam being one of the best generals I have ever seen, sometimes he truly drives me mad “For the last time general: we don’t know yet the full capabilities of the interlopers, for as far as we know, opening fire on them would spell our doom, and even in the case they weren’t more powerful than we are, with half of our orbital defensive installations, our entire defense force and Solvin’s armada, they would, at least, get that they need to tread carefully.”



It has been almost four claws since the Interlopers took a stationary orbit around Skalga, for the first two claws no communications of any kind: radio, electromagnetic, radiation or any other kind of detectible communication could be heard from the objects, at least beyond what were assumed to be the garbled products of normal ship functions, then, at the start of the third claw a decently sized number of what are, definitely, warships, started being deployed from various protected hangars of four of the five things; energy readings indicated multiple turreted small, medium and heavy railguns charging on the things, a fact that still baffles me, the energy output of those ships’ engines must be enormous.

Despite this, the ships only limited themselves to take a defensive position around the interlopers, aiming at our defensive installations and fleet.



Strangely no ship has yet been seen leaving one of the Interlopers, it must hold either reserves or a trump card that they are waiting to reveal.



Most importantly though, at three claws and a half, a small vehicle left the formation and directed itself on a very low trajectory toward our ships, after scans confirmed no detectable weapons on the thing, I ordered for the craft to be seized and be brought down on Skalga for further studies.



Its contents now laid in front of me, on the floor of the governor manor:



A small golden-plated box and two probes reminiscent of the ones used by the Cradle’s inhabitants at the start of their early space age.



The box itself contained a series of golden tablets with symbols engraved on them, supposedly these are representations of their math and our scientists were working overtime to understand them.



The probes though, were much more curious: they had too primitive technology to have been built on the spot by the Interlopers and the extensive radiation and micrometeorite damages pretty much confirmed that they once traveled the void before being taken on board of the Interlopers.



The bigger one had a golden plaque with symbols engraved on it covering a golden disk strangely similar to the musical records once commonly used on Skalga centuries ago to play music, and also still used by some collectors.



The smaller one had a similar engraving on its side:

Like the golden plaque on the other one it had a series of lines that connected what the scientific teams believed to be stars to another central star (maybe it was their home star and a representation of their empire?), another series of engravings seemed to look like a stellar system (maybe their home system?), a specific engraving looked like an atom of dihydrogen and, the most important one, the one in the top right of the composition, represented the probe itself overlayed with two biological beings, the face of its creators and possibly the face of the Interlopers: two lanky, seemingly almost completely furless beings with…front facing eyes.



Despite the painful reminder that those eyes gave me of the Arxurs, I held myself together, a being couldn’t be evil just based on the position of their eyes and these two, supposedly a male and a female judging from their rather…explicit appearances, didn’t seem to have the harsh and crude body of an Arxur, on the contrary, they looked rather gentle in appearance…



“While I understand your concerns, Kam, I must side with the Governess on this matter: they are surrounded by at least 50 to 1 by our forces and up until now they didn’t show any signs of aggression, for all I have seen, it seems like they might be afraid, somewhat, their ships have only taken defensive positions around the bigger ones and haven’t even tried anything yet, beyond sending us these things, I think we should further study them and maybe try to open a communication channel with them.” my advisor Chlen said.



“Chlen, you forget that the translation algorithm of our translators somehow has their language in it! The same translation algorithm that we \*stole\* from the Feds! This is clearly the sign that those brainwashed freaks had been in contact with these beings for who knows how long, for all we know they might be working  with the Feds and this is just the start of a plan to bring the Sapients Coalition down!” General Kam rebuked.



“Just look at the Kam! The Feds literally paralyze themselves seeing the front-facing eyes of an Arxur, how do you think they would cooperate with these sapients?!”



“Feds are some of the most gullible sapients I ever saw, as far as we know they might be tricking them into doing their biddings, masquerading themselves as \*’fellow preys’!”



“I CHALLENGE YOU ON THIS!”



And there they go again, ramming each other to prove who is right, how these two became friends is still something that I wonder about to this day…

Fortunately there is still someone who hasn’t dragged himself into these childish fights, Admiral Solvin, without his tempestive intervention we would have been completely unprepared for this event, now he was sitting on a bench, watching the engraving of the ‘faces’ of the interlopers on the smaller probe, clearly in the middle of a deep reflection.



I approached him, his expertise could be very useful at this very moment: “What’s going on in your mind Admiral?” I asked.



“Governess, the initial comment of your advisor made me think: all the major ships of these interlopers have a designation constituted by a name that the traductor approximates to \*\[lifeboat\]\* a designation from 1 to 5 and a name that seems like the actual name of the actual ship, almost all of these names are either partially or completely not translatable, but from the partial names that we got: \*\[Great Journey\]; \[Traveler\]; \[Solrise\] and Pioneer\*, they all seem to reference the idea of a journey to a better place.

I don’t want to be rushed mam, but maybe these beings are really scared: they escaped from \*something\* hoping to find salvation here and possibly they didn’t expect to find us. If so, then, I advise caution, they probably feel like a trapped animal and an impulsive action might push them to attack.”



Before I could reply to the Admiral a member of the scientific team reached me “Mam, we figured out how to play the record, we are waiting for you to give the order to play it”



“Thanks, give us  a second, we will be right over there.” I replied.

I got up and walked towards my advisors still locked in their fighting: “YOU TWO, STOP ACTING LIKE CHILDREN OR I WILL PERSONALLY SHOW YOU HOW A REAL SKALGAN FIGHT! THE SCIENTIST FOUND A WAY TO PLAY THE RECORD, SO COME WITH ME AND GIVE YOURSELVES A DEMEANOR!” I bellowed to my shocked advisors, who promptly stopped their fight and followed me and Solvin with their ears lowered.



In front of us stood the result of hours of restless study, thinking and improvising of the the scientific team: an old Skalgan record player adapted for this specific record and connected to a projector and an audio system, by far not the prettiest thing, but if it can gets the job done then its good.



“Well, we are all here and the Interlopers aren’t going anywhere at the moment, please, proceed to play the record” I said.



Without hesitation the scientists took the golden record and put it on the player; after the diamond pin was lowered on it, a typical winding noise came from it, and a voice in the Same language of the interlopers came up while the projector projected as series of static images:



/——————————-/



\*\*\[NOTE: the following texts of the Golden Record will be reported in their unmodified forms for clarity\]\*\*



/——————————-/



\>\*This [Voyager spacecraft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Program) was constructed by the [United States of America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America). We are a community of 240 million human beings among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet [Earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). We human beings are still divided into nation states, but these states are rapidly becoming a global civilization. We cast this message into the cosmos ... It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our civilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed. Of the 200 billion stars in the [Milky Way galaxy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_galaxy), some – perhaps many – may have inhabited planets and space faring civilizations. If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message: This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope some day, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\*



Along with this announcement came a series of [116 images](https://youtu.be/NAN1kt4SG9E) representing various planets of an alien solar system, one of them specifically was the supposedly third planet from the star: a blue and green marble simply labeled as \*Earth-Home\*, the images then changed from images of astral bodies to images of chemical compositions and, most importantly, images of pieces of life of these ‘humans’ with, along them what appeared to be salutations in multiple languages of which many, unfortunately, I couldn’t understand:

\*\*RECORD TERMINATED.**\*\***



\*\*RESUMPTION OF CURRENT MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION\*\*



/——————————-/

…



That was…intense to hear, \[4 minutes\] of dozens of what seemed to be like greetings judging by the fiew ones that our traductors could guess, this must be a sign, they wanted us to receive these ancient probes of theirs as a gest of greeting us.



“I knew it! Kam, you owe me a drink!” Chlen said, strangely, for once, Kam didn’t start arguing with him, clearly deep in his thoughts.



I took the initiative: “While this seems to prove that they don’t have ill wills against us, we can’t still let our guards down…but I think the best course of action is to try to contact them.”



“That really seems like the best course of action madame.” Kam responded, “I’m fully onboard with this idea” Chlen added.



“Then it is settled, let’s go to the conference room and open a channel with our visitors.” let’s just hope that they don’t freak out over our base level of knowledge of their language.



/——————————-/



\*\*Memory transcription subject:\*\* Noah Williams, Capitan of Ark 3 “Odyssey”.



\*\*Location:\*\* Ark 3 captains personal Q.E.(Quantum  Entanglement) communication room.



\*\*Date:\*\* \[12 July 4036 S.T.T.\]



\*\*Status:\*\* \**Currently freaking out*\*.



/——————————-/



\**“Hello interstellar travelers…”\** They know English.



*”..I’m Tarva, \[president\] of the \[World of Death*\] Republic…”\* THEY KNOW ENGLISH.



\*”...we thank you for your greetings and for your willingness to open diplomatic relations”\* THEY KNOW \**FUCKING*\* ENGLISH ALREADY!

  


\*”I’m Admiral Solvin of the 1st Sapients Coalition Fleet, i wanted to personally thank you for your help in our battle with the Federation”\* OH GOD THERE ARE MORE THAN ON SAPIENT SPECIE IN THIS SYSTEM!!



THIS IS EQUALLY EXCITING AND WORRISOME! HOW CAN THEY ALREADY KNOW ENGLISH ARE THEY THAT SMART?!



Their body structure too is equally strange and familiar, the president of this republic looked like a sheep, but with a long tail and…paws instead of clogs…a space sheep…a sleep, somehow my subconscious screamed that it was right.



The other one, instead, looked like a giant hedgehog crossed with a porcupine by the look of those quills.



They had just finished sending a message inviting us to a meeting at the government manor of this planet, and they were currently waiting for a response.



Around me stood the holographic projections of the other four captains of the Arks: Capitan Zhao of the ‘Pioneer’, capitan Naomi Nagata of the ‘Dawnbreak’ and Captain Hanse Castillo of the ‘Voyager’ were deep in a conversation between each other about this news, the only one not currently arguing whether or not to accept this request or keep the defensive stance was capitan Elias Meier of the ‘Volare’, he was deep in his thoughts, pondering the informations received, he was part of the last generation that ever saw Earth and with more than 200 years on his back, he was by now at the start of his autumn days, despite this, he still had the energy of a young man, clearly indicated by his sudden loud call to calm down.



“…I get that this is an extraordinary circumstance, but it is exactly at times like this that we must be resolute in our decision, so I propose a vote on which course of action to take, who is in favor of keeping our current defensive position until further proofs of the aliens thrust worthiness?”



Capitan Castillio and Capitan Zhao both lifted their hand.



“And who is instead in favor of accepting the aliens’ invitation?”



I, Meier and a titubant Capitan Naomi lifted our hand.



“Then it is set, we will accept the aliens’ invitations and a mission will be prepared and sent to initiate first contact with our new neighbors, details on the mission requirements will be discussed with the intervention of our own Ark councils, this session is adjourned.”



“One last thing…”, I interfered, “…I would like to be part of the contact team.”



“Noah, you know that there is the danger of this being some sort of trick from the disgruntled inhabitants of this system, are you really sure of that?” Meier responded.



“I’m not naive, I will take proper precautions but I feel like, if their intentions are genuine, the arrival of one of the capitans of the Arks with the team will be a great boost to our diplomatic contacts…I also admits that I find interesting these aliens, they are far more…animal-like that we could have ever predicted and I’m curious big seeing them closer, plus, if anything bad were to happen to me Capitan Castillo would finally have the right excuse to use his couple of…\*toys\* that he has built” I could swear at those words I could see Castillo's eyes light up.



“Then, if so, the request is accepted, now thought I think we all need to go to prepare for the upcoming events see you soon captains.”



To these words the holograms disappeared and the room got quiet.



“Well, I need to go grab Sarah and her team now before they have a complete meltdown trying to figure out why aliens already know a human language.” I thought to myself.



Before exiting the room my eyes landed once again non the beings that sent their invitations to us and I thought “I can’t wait to meet you all face to face, we have a lot to discuss”.

I customized it by adding the 1060 and choose the blue light as I have one teen that has acne. 

The price is $721 and selecting faster shipping.

Is there any other panels I should consider or additional customizations that I should add? "

How could I have drafted this UW FDN deck differently (2-3)?,lrcast,1hvj4s9,2025-01-06 23:16:05,0,0.5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/lrcast/comments/1hvj4s9/how_could_i_have_drafted_this_uw_fdn_deck/,mtgarenadrafter,,"https://preview.redd.it/thw00cskxhbe1.png?width=2238&format=png&auto=webp&s=f82227c08fb657902e5150f9b40f4ee5a4ec1c3a

This deck felt pretty weak and lacking synergy. I don't have much removal and most of it is bounce spells, which is good in a more controlling deck, but wasn't great here. I have some ETB cards and a few lifegain synergies, but I'm missing most of UW's best fliers.

  
After reviewing the draft, there are a few picks that I might make differently, but I don't think they would have been a huge improvement. Was there another color I should have been in instead? White dried up pretty significantly half way through pack two, but there doesn't seem to be another color that was more open.

Here are my thoughts:

*  P1P8 - Take \[\[Savannah Lions\]\] instead of \[\[Goldvein Pick\]\]. Though at this point, I didn't know that I wouldn't have many fliers.
* P3P1 - Take \[\[Make your Move\]\] instead of \[\[Uncharted Voyage\]\]. Permanent removal seems better in a more aggressive deck.
* P3P3 - Take \[\[Prideful Parent\]\] instead of \[\[Bigfin Bouncer\]\]. It's both cheaper and a more aggro-slanted card.
* P3P5 - Take \[\[Mischievous Pup\]\] instead of \[\[Anthem of Champions\]\] - The anthem ended up not being splashable and the pup works well with some of the bounce synergies that I have.

  
Even with these changes, the deck still feels like it would be weak. I didn't see any signals that another color was open, though. Any advice would be appreciated."

Hey everyone, I'm in a bit of a tricky situation and could really use some help. I recently picked up a pair of Moka Sfx model EPR 150LEDM moving head lights from the marketplace. However, I'm having trouble controlling them because I can't find a profile for them anywhere. I also don't have the manual, and after a thorough search online, I still can't seem to find it.

If someone could create a profile for these lights that I can use, I’d be willing to pay 40 CAD for your help. Thanks in advance!

Update 14.1 is already almost here, and it's time to share what's coming to the game!

**""Remembrance of Ming's Past"" Adventure**

A legendary admiral and explorer of the early Ming Dynasty, Zheng He commanded seven massive trade expeditions. We commemorate his voyages with a two-part Adventure during Updates 14.1 and 14.2.

Complete special missions to earn the new ""The Ming Legacy"" flag, the ""Zheng He's Voyages"" patch, and Adventure tokens that can be used across multiple events in the Armory.

Active players will be able to get the new premium Tier IX Pan-Asian battleship Taihang for free.

Among other themed content we’ve added commander Zheng He himself, and the ""Chinese Treasure Ship"" permanent camouflage for Taihang. We will reveal the visuals of this permanent camouflage later.

https://preview.redd.it/ow1b3lxrttae1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d921f90c9837b899659db080a068988eb6352fb

**The Finest Hour Collection and Unique Dutch commander Conrad Helfrich**

Conrad Helfrich was a Lieutenant Admiral of the Royal Netherlands Navy and an overall commander of the Dutch naval forces in Southeast Asia during World War II. In the first stages of the Pacific War, he was one of the most successful Allied commanders in that theater. In September 1945, Helfrich had the honor of representing his country at the Japanese surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay.

With Update 14.1, we are adding a new puzzle collection dedicated to this Unique Dutch Commander. The collection contains 60 elements, which you can earn via the new The Finest Hour containers and The Finest Hour Premium containers.

The Finest Hour containers will be available for Adventure Tokens that you earn by completing ""Remembrance of Ming's Past"" missions. Obtaining a total of 84 containers will guarantee finishing the collection.

Players actively following the adventure will be able to earn enough The Finest Hour containers during Update 14.1 to complete the collection.

Note that you will have to choose how to spend earned Adventure Tokens since the amount available through the missions won’t be enough to purchase both the Unique Dutch commander and the new Pan-Asian Tier IX battleship Taihang. You can get the Dutch Commander in 14.1 but if you want to get Taihang for free you will have to wait until 14.2, when the 2nd set of missions unlocks.

Below you can check the tables with the commander's enhanced skills and talents:

This cosmic wheel has spun uninterrupted—until now. A dire threat looms on the galaxy's edge, brought forth by a man who dared to defy the very fabric of creation.

*You find yourselves navigating the uncharted regions of the Astral Sea, where you have discovered a relic that glows like a falling star. Together, you must traverse diverse worlds, unite in your efforts, and grow in strength and knowledge. Your ultimate goal is to confront and overcome this looming destruction to save Orion.*

*I hope you packed lunch.*  


**Greetings, Voyagers!**  
My name is Berg, I’m a 27-year-old Swede and an experienced Dungeon Master with 9 years of storytelling and world-building under my belt. I’m a joyful nerd who’s passionate about nature, reading, sports, and spending far too much time crafting intricate campaigns. Before the official release of Spelljammer, I created my own homebrew version, featuring fewer restrictions on martial classes, a custom ship battle system, and 9 unique ship roles.

Unfortunately, due to a new job, one of our players had to leave the campaign, so we’re now searching for a fantastic new adventurer to join our crew! We run our game every **Sunday at 7 PM CET**, and we’re hoping the new player can join us for their first session on **the 12th**.

Currently, the party is nearing level 6. They’re locked in a fierce arena battle against a shark armed with magnetic gauntlets and hot on the trail of a galactic criminal jester who’s scheming to create a dangerous chemical weapon. If that sounds like the kind of adventure you're ready for, read on to learn more about what the campaign offers!



**Campaign Expectations**

**Heavy Homebrew**  
For this campaign, you can only choose from the Homebrew and revised races I've created. There are 35 different races, including subraces, so you'll hopefully find one you like. There are also significant changes to how magic, planes, and the Astral Sea itself work. No need to read up on everything beforehand; I'll share how it all works as we go!

**Open World**  
You can travel between 70 planets, each with its own unique fauna and culture. Discover the astral factions and navigate the complex world of politics, or simply spend your time sailing the Astral Sea, seeking out adventure.

**Roleplay and Storytelling**  
As you explore the vast space, a great threat looms across the distant reaches. This threat will soon seek to shatter the world of Orion. While the future is said to be set in stone, your actions can alter its fate. The journey is yours to shape. Will you be treasure hunters seeking ancient artifacts in long-forgotten worlds? Renegade pirates crushing all in your path for wealth? Mercenaries for the highest bidder? The story will be character-driven, with personal goals and trials for each player.

**Ship Management**  
The space between planets poses greater threats than the planets themselves. As you sail through space, you must manage oxygen, rations, crew, and the ship itself. You start as rookies in your roles, learning and improving over time, as do the crewmembers you hire. Over time, you can use ship actions tied to your role and provide specific buffs to crew and ship. The ship roles act like a second class for your character, becoming more effective and varied as you level up.

**Challenging Combat**  
Prepare for encounters that test your wits and teamwork. Some combat scenarios are designed to be difficult, requiring strategy and cooperation. Not every battle can be won by brute force; sometimes, clever roleplay is the key to survival. There will also be lingering injuries that require more than just healing magic.



**Here are the requirements for the players:**

* Just a personal preference of mine: I want the players to be around my age, so the game will be 20+.
* The campaign will be run on Roll20, and we will chat over Discord. You must have a decent mic and you can use a camera if you wish, I will use one but it's not a requirement.
* We run the session on Sundays starting at 7 pm CET for about 3 hours. Sometimes, it might extend to four hours, but those will be rare. I am looking for a reliable player who can commit to the session schedule. If something comes up and you can’t make it, just let us know as soon as possible.
* This game will be LGBTQ+ friendly. I have zero tolerance for racism, homophobia, and making others feel uncomfortable.
* Preferably, no hardcore metagaming or murderhobos.

  
**If these conditions work for you, then please send me a PM and answer the questions below. Sometime before sunday, I will hit you up on Discord where we can plan for a chat.**

Right now, I'm thinking of getting rid of soulcaller, lightshell, imprisoned in the moon, amulet ofc, witness protection, and unfortunately chandra+goldvein. I just didn't get enough fixing and adding mountains and a potentially dead bomb might lose more games than a successful chandra would win. I think 17 lands is the right number with even 1 big planeswalker bomb, so I'm not cutting down to 16.  
Also, I was unsure about a lot of picks here so draft feedback would be appreciated! [https://www.17lands.com/draft/1a1c1ad16b624c74ad822d3d7f7adde0](https://www.17lands.com/draft/1a1c1ad16b624c74ad822d3d7f7adde0)

Here's the draft log: [https://www.17lands.com/draft/5d363e2f481c488d987036fbb046d023](https://www.17lands.com/draft/5d363e2f481c488d987036fbb046d023)

I first picked a \[\[Celestial Armor\]\] and spent the first pack picking a bunch of different colors. Once I saw \[\[Dreadwing Scavenger\]\] P2P3, I decided to commit fully to Dimir. I don't think it's worth splashing the armor, with many BB and UU cards.

  
This draft felt particularly difficult to find my lane, so I'd love any feedback on what picks you would do differently. And I still need to find two more cards to cut. I'm leaning towards cutting some of \[\[Elementalist Adept\]\], \[\[Erudite Wizard\]\], , \[\[Rune Sealed Wall\]\], \[\[Macabre Waltz\]\], or \[\[Pilfer\]\]."

I ranked and commented on the 41 “new to me” games I played this year,soloboardgaming,1hqtpwo,2024-12-31 21:25:27,47,0.91,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgaming/comments/1hqtpwo/i_ranked_and_commented_on_the_41_new_to_me_games/,joulesFect,,"Hello everyone!

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgaming/s/YtSfToAlCL) last year and had a lot of fun writing it and chatting with everyone about the games, so I thought I would do it again this year!

Again, this was a great year for solo gaming for me. Last year, I resolved not to buy many games and to play the ones I had more. I failed miserably with this objective, but it means that I have a lot more impressions for you this year. I’ve attached a picture of my plays for reference.

Let me know what you think of these games or your favorite new-to-you games this year!

Happy New Year everyone!

For reference, here's my top 10:

1 - Arkham Horror the Card game - 2 - Mage Knight - 3 - Revive - 4 - Ark Nova - 5 - Lost Ruins of Arnak - 6 - Gaia Project - 7 - Darwins Journey - 8 - Anachrony - 9 - Concordia - 10 -  Carnival Zombie 2nd edition deluxe

Please note that the ratings are ordered from least to most enjoyable solo (to me). I'm using the BGG ranking system, allowing half points. Also, I've played many of these only once, so these are more first impressions than actual reviews. Some of these I've tried solo two-handed to get a feel for them, but it's not the best way to play them so they rank much lower than if I had played them multiplayer.

**41 - Ankh’or (2019) - 4 /10**

Played solo two-handed. Felt like a worse splendor where you trade the engine building for an uninteresting spacial puzzle. Too simple for my taste and I feel I have much better games in the same style and weight bracket.

**40 - Eight-Minute Empire (2012) - 5 / 10**

This is an empire-building / area control / set collection game in which you place cubes on a shared map by drafting cards in order to have influence on the regions and potentially score points. It’s a filler game that’s supposed to be playable in 8 minutes. The solo experience of course playing two-handed leaves a lot to be desired. Still a very nice little filler game, looking forward to taking it out on a game night.

**39 - Mini Rogue (2020) - 5 / 10**

It's a fun little time, but ultimately the decisions are really binary, with often a clear winner for what to do. This has the game feeling on rails for me. It's still a fun distraction, but it feels repetitive to me.

**38 - Isle of Cats (2019) - 5.5 / 10**

I was very impressed with this at first, but it quickly faded to being really repetitive save for how the objective cards shake up the gameplay. The box is huge too and this feels overproduced. I would sell it off but my partner loves it.

**37 - Sagrada (2017) - 6 / 10**

The game is really fast and breezy. To me it's its greatest quality and biggest downfall. It plays in only a few minutes, but it's the type of placement puzzle that gets more restrictive as the game goes on. I don't really like that, because you start up thinking “ I guess I'll do this” because the puzzle is so open-ended, and end up thinking “ This is my only option”, so the decision space goes from arbitrary, to tight, to almost nonexistent. The solo mode is really uninspired as well, although I've yet to try some of the solo variants on the geek.

**36 - The Voyages of Marco Polo (2015) - 6 / 10**

I think the game is really clever. How the bonuses in cities change from game to game, how you need to carefully place your dice, and how their values affect the actions you can take. However, it still feels dry in its implementation and very procedural. Go here, get resources, convert resources into points, rinse and repeat. It lacks excitement, especially with the solo variant I tried.

**35 - Kingdom Builder (2011) - 6 / 10**

In this, you play cards to expand a network of trade houses on a shared board. There are special abilities to uncover and each game has unique scoring objectives. Played solo two-handed, and it was a surprisingly fun time. I thought the one card-in-hand restriction would be imitative, but with the numerous objectives to pursue felt really fun to explore. I would keep seeing new potential patterns for placement and feel engaged throughout.

**34 - Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2022) - 6 / 10**

Quite enjoyable and different as a pandemic spin-off. Instead of building your hand of cards to cure illnesses, you are trying to complete mission cards. There is also a protagonist in each game with special abilities and you can build up your hand of cards to be more proficient in certain actions. It's fun, but it also feels quite similar to other pandemic games. I also own Fall of Rome, Iberia, The Cure and this one is my least favorite. With a Star Wars playlist playing though, I had a good time.

**33 - Hunted: Mining Colony 415 (2021) - 6 / 10**

Trapped on a mining colony, you play cards from a deck to resolve effects and potentially escape. This is all very reminiscent of The  Lost Expedition. The kicker here is that you can fight aliens with a dexterity system where you shoot by throwing a token in the box to hit a target. It's tense and has push your luck As you are trying not to encounter aliens.

**32 - Dungeon Petz (2011) - 6 / 10**

What a unique game! Is it like a euro worker placement merged with a Tamagotchi simulator ?! The solo variant isn't that interesting, hence the lower score because the game is really fun, but it works if you're itching to play the game. Looking forward to trying this one with a human.

**31 - Fantastic Factories (2019) - 6 / 10**

I really thought I'd like this one more than I did. I remember thinking the solo mode looked neat when I read the rules. There is something about the game, I think, that is rooted in the dice action selection which I find uninteresting. You build your engine, but always feel limited by your dice. When you get an engine going, it feels like you just milk it for points a few times and the game is over. The action combos on card and dice action selection let me down as well I think.

**30 - Final Girl (2021) - 6 / 10**

I'll probably get crucified for this, but I just don't really like it. I'm sure I'd enjoy it more with having more content, but I hate how this is packaged. It takes a ton of space relative to the components. Also, the moment-to-moment gameplay / cardplay was frustrating to me. The roll to resolve I'm usually fine with, but the dice are heavily stacked against you here. I know there are ways around it. I also dislike the low variability in possible actions. To me the most interesting part of the game was how the villain operates and the item cards. I don't see why I would pull this out instead of Arkham Horror LCG, and ultimately it's to this game's detriment. I can recognize why people like it, however, it's thematic nail-biting, but it feels flat to me compared to my favorite of all time.

**29 -  Long Shot The Dice Game (2022) - 6 / 10**

In Long Shot, you are betting on horse races, rolling dice, marking concessions, jerseys, and helmets, and buying horses to make as much money as possible. I love how each horse has a special ability and plays solo to 8 players. It’s more engaging with more people around the table commenting on how the race is going, but it’s still an enjoyable time solo. I love turning my brain off, rolling dice, marking things with my dry-erase marker, and seeing how the race turns up.

**28 - Hybris disordered Cosmos (2023) - 7 / 10**

In Hybris, you play as Olympian gods vying for ascension in a reinvented steam-punk Greece. This is a worker placement with conflict, as you can attack other players. Solo, you are playing against Chronos whom you’ve trapped to tap his essence in your ascension. The automa board is very involved and thematically appropriate as Chronos is at the center with chains spanning out. This is a very complicated game. I felt I was barely starting to understand how to play (read how to play well, not how to run the game) by the end of my first game. It’s promising, however. I love how each god feels very unique to play and how interactive the game feels with the unpredictable events Chronos and his avatars can throw at you.

**27 - The search for Planet X (2020) - 7 / 10**

This is the best deduction I've played. The puzzle is enticing and easy to follow. Solo is great, although I'm terrible at the game and the virtual adversary logic is without fault, it's a fun time that has adjustable difficulty. I feel like an astronomer when I play. 

**26 - Set a watch (2019) - 7 / 10**

This was unfortunately somewhat of a disappointment. The base box lacks a bit of variety and after 2 games I'd felt like I had seen what the game has to offer. You are managing dice rolls of multiple heroes to meet challenges on a card row of monsters with various abilities. It feels reminiscent of Carnival Zombie, One Deck dungeon and a Warps Edge. I like the theme a lot, as well as the puzzle to keep your party afloat, but the games run surprisingly long, and I'd often get tired of the rinse-and-repeat nature of the puzzle before the end.

**25 - Outlive (2017) - 7.5 / 10**

I like how interactive it is with the worker placement, although you lose some of that solo. I really love survival video games, and the theme comes through strongly with this one. I love the gamefllow with certain checks being made at some points in the turn and the worker strength with numbers. Ultimately it's a lot of resource gathering, but each action feels considered and the weight of those decisions elevates what I feared would be a run-of-the-mill worker placement to something different.

**24 - Tindaya (2022) - 7.5 /10**

In Tindaya, you plan a tribe of natives in the Canari Islands while gods change the layout of the land around you. Kinda like Spirit Island if you were playing the Dahan. It’s a little harder to learn than I would have liked. Played quite smoothly when I had the flow though. I like how survival like it felt to manage my little people and their buildings, trying to outmaneuver the god's wrath. The end feels quite anticlimactic as you soon realize in the last round if you will win or lose, but the puzzle getting there was engrossing. The deluxe edition components are awesome as well and the box is filled really tight with goodness.

**23 - Sky Team (2023) - 7.5 / 10**

Surprisingly engaging with a very simple solo variant. I love how this weirdly feels like you are piloting a plane. It feels a little bit like Under Falling Skies, maybe it's the box form factor, maybe it's the dice placement puzzle, or the fact that it has a lot of scenarios and variant modules.

**22 - Rajas of the Ganges (2017) - 7.5 / 10**

Worker placement in India where you build a network on your own board and race two separate point tracks to win the game. I played a fan-made automa deck that blocks spots. It was a lot of fun to solo. I love the use of dice to buy tiles, many actions are laid with little bonuses you get that give you just enough to keep going. The weight is near perfect too as it isn't too big of a brain burn. Not the best solo, but definitely serviceable.

**21 - Lewis  & Clark: The Expedition (2013) - 7.5 / 10**

Trek through the American continent to be the first explorer to reach the Pacific Ocean. This feels like Everdell a little bit, you amass resources via Worker Placement and convert them with cards to advance your expedition. I love the racing aspect of this. Its a nice puzzle and you are trying to put combos in place that move you forward efficiently. Also, you need to manage your resources carefully as carrying too much can negate any progress you make in a round. Solo is really easy to run as you play against an opponent that moves one step every turn you take. You can increase difficulty by simply having it start further along the trail.

**20 - Marrakesh (2022) - 7.5 / 10**

I’d almost call this “Mini-games, Marrakesh eurogame edition”. The gameplay is very particular with this one, you choose cylinders to play in a cardboard tower in which they can get stuck falling down. Then from the ones that everyone selected that got out, everyone drafts some that will be used to conduct actions. The color dictates the action, and there are about 10 different colors / action types to play. The beauty of this game is that most minigames intertwine in some way. Get some water here, spend it there, put this red cylinder here to boost this action, etc. I played this solo two-handed and it was still very fun. Unfortunately, the game is only soloable with an expansion. I’m looking forward to trying it multiplayer.

**19 - Nucleum (2023) - 7.5 / 10**

This is what would happen if Brass and Barrage had a weird dystopian nuclear baby. This was a tough one to learn. I hate how Turczi's designs have different logic for actions for the automa than the human. It makes it feel like I need to learn two games at once. Regardless, when you get the hang of it, it's really fun. I especially love the action selection and the possibility to use your action tokens as rails on the board. It feels great also to have a game of this 

**18 -  The Guild of Merchant Explorers - 7.5 / 10**

In Merchant Explorers, you play an explorer, mandated by the Queen to chart and explore a divided kingdom. This feels like a deluxe version of a roll and write. You place cubes on the map to expand, flip cards that indicate what can be explored, unlock new abilities that are very asymmetric and powerful. Each era, you lose all of your progress and need to restore the map save for villages you uncovered by completely exploring a region. You can then start exploring again from these points. I love the abilities you unlock, and the feeling of progression slowly making your mark on the map, having almost everything wiped out and progressing again. There is some nice puzzling that goes on in trying to evaluate which cards have yet to come up in a round and what you might be able to achieve. I dislike the tiny components, but the game is not as fiddly as I thought it would be by watching some of the youtube reviews. I also dislike the box form factor, and how the game is somewhat expensive given its low component count.

**17 - Tzolk'in The Mayan Calendar (2012) - 8 / 10**

Tzolk’in is a worker placement with the kicker that you place workers on rotating gears that progress workers to new actions each turn. I used a solo variant on BGG to play this solo. It's a little bit more interesting multiplayer, but the variant I tried was easy to implement and fun to run. I love this game. The turning gears are less difficult to plan for than I thought. The different strategies are all laid out pretty clearly on the multiple actions. The actions and turn-to-turn gameplay are all really interesting, it definitely had \*my\* gears turning haha.

**16 - Harmonies (2024) - 8 / 10**

Everybody was raving about this so I almost rolled my eyes trying it for the first time thinking it was going to be overrated. “How good can a Cascadia clone really be” I was thinking. It's a wonderful game. The components are fantastic, the placement puzzle is tight but not overbearingly so. I love that The puzzle is 3d, the placement rules for tiles is logical and that you can manipulate the cards and placement cleverly for scoring. Scoring being driven by a large stack of cards is also awesome, and adds tons of replayability as each game feels different. Like “Neat, I built a bunch of cool mountain clusters in this game” or “I managed to optimize my river path perfectly!”.

**15 - Whistle Mountain (2020) - 8 / 10**

This is such an underrated gem in my opinion. The worker placement board is very dynamic with the asynchronous turns and the fact that you literally build it as you go! You can build some crazy worker placement spots that give a ton of resources or activate a bunch of actions. I haven't tried the official PNP solo, but I'm looking forward to it. My biggest letdown is the theming, although I appreciate the climate change allegory behind the design.

**14 - 51st State Ultimate Edition (2023) - 8 / 10**

I already owned the game, but this Kickstarter edition spawns a better solo mode, screen-printed components, and all of the expansions. I'm looking forward to exploring the box further. I love the multi-use cards in this one, as well as the fact that it feels snappy and doesn't overstay its welcome. The resource conversion of needing to go through contact icons to play cards is a little cumbersome, although mechanically required.

**13 - Resist! (2022) - 8.5 / 10**

This is a difficult game! It feels quite hopeless as it's a war of attrition. You start with a good deck and engine, and the puzzle is to keep it going as long as possible. I appreciate how good the theme integration is. I love how easy it is to pull out. A strong package. If I didn't get an awesome price on it, I would probably have waited for Witchcraft though, for which the theme appeals to more.

**12 - Ultimate Railroads (2021) - 8.5 / 10**

I owned and liked Russian Railroads, so I bought this and sold it off, and it blew my socks off! The amount of content in the box is amazing, it was so fun exploring all of the expansions and modules. The solo mode is nothing interesting, but it's good enough to allow you to play solo. It's quick to play and set up too, with a good ratio of depth to effort. The puzzle of pushing these train tracks has never been so enticing.

**11 - The White Castle (2023) - 8.5 / 10**

This is a dice worker placement, but the board is very dynamic with cards that change available actions and combos. The puzzle is trying to navigate the most efficient action as available. Even though the solo bot is a disgusting cheater that's neigh unbeatable, it's a great puzzle. Lots of options for chaining actions, great presentation, tight gameplay with very limited turns, and multiple strategies to explore. Really a great package in a small box, if you can get it to fit back inside.

**10 - Endless Winter: Paleoamericans (2022) - 8.5 / 10**

I love the theme and production values of this game. I’ve seen many complaints about the solo mode being too easy, but that’s easy to remedy with the officially posted solo variants. I’ve also seen complaints about how it’s multiple mini games just thrown together. I disagree, I think each system intertwines nicely and loves the flow of the game. I also love how easy it is to run the automa. I think this is a wonderful package for anyone who loves euros.

**9 - Viscounts of the West Kingdom (2020) - 8.5 / 10**

In Viscounts, you are playing cards from a deck and moving a knight on a rondell, where you end up dictating what you can do as well as the icons on the 3 cards rotating in front of you. It's a very engrossing puzzle full of possibilities with all the mini-games you can explore. I love how novel the card play and management felt for an aficionado of deck builders like myself. The bot has multiple personalities which shake up how it feels. The greatest comparison I have for it is Wayfarers of the south tigris (coming up).

**8 - Carnegie (2022) - 8.5 / 10**

What I love most about Carnegie is the worker placement/displacement puzzle on your own board, how you need to be ready for any actions at any time because you play half your game on the bot’s turn, and the little tracks you pull out of the board. Its tactility and presentation are really good. The Brass-esque board is a nice complement and fits the theme. The solo mode I found really fun in this one.

**7 - Skymines (2022) - 8.5 / 10**

I owned and loved Mombasa, but the new version looked great. It's lacking in the graphical design department, the board and cards are busy and hard to parse while looking good, but otherwise, the solo mode is really solid and the package is still a great production. Easy to run, emulates a two-player game quite well. I still can't believe this can be played solo because the interaction is so high. 

**6 - Pharaon (2019) - 9 / 10**

In this, you are placing color gems to take actions, it's kinda like a color-coded worker placement. The catch is you placing on a center rotating ring which gives access to different actions using different colors each round. What a fantastic game for solo and an underrated gem! The solo mode works so well, it’s very easy to run, but has good difficulty scaling and variability. The game itself has multiple euro mini-games, where you try and push for maximum scoring in a few areas. I like it a lot, and have yet to try with the expansion which I’m sure will make it even better.

**5 - Bullet Heart (2021) - 9 / 10**

One of my best surprises of the year. The slight push your luck, with the pattern-matching gameplay tickles my brain in just the right way. I love how many options there are to play it multiplayer, and the variability solo for having the 8 characters be a potential boss to defeat with unique rules. It's a slim box too. I’m not a fan of this art style, but it’s a very well put together game, highly recommended as a solo !

**4 - Gloomhaven Buttons and Bugs (2024) - 9.5 / 10**

This does a wonderful job at emulating its bigger sibling feeling in a fraction of the time. It's for all intents and purposes, mini Gloomhaven, with all the good and bad that entails. For my money, it's the perfect solo game, crunchy, easy to set up, quick and engaging. This little oddly shaped box is filled to the brim with goodness and is a lighthouse reference for anyone trying to design or publish a solid solo package.

**3 - Wayfarers of the south Tigris (2022) - 9.5 / 10**

My mind was blown when I first saw a playthrough of this on Totally Tabled. The blend of mechanisms is quite unique. It's a tableau builder with a dice worker placement that you can improve with tiles. You can also place workers on cards and go up this modular track with bonuses and restrictions ala Arnak. The bot feels good to play against and has multiple “personalities” which drives different strategies similarly to Viscounts. The game is beautiful to look at, and the strategies are diverse. My biggest regret this year is playing it only once, but I’ve thought about that single play a lot.

**2 - Darwin’s Journey (2023) - 9.5 / 10**

This was the year I found out that my absolute favorite board game “mechanic” is combos. This game and Revive made me realize that. You can chain actions together wonderfully in this and it's satisfying. I found the solo really hard to grok, but it's a worthwhile opponent when you get around to it. I love how tight the worker placement is with actions being divided in “books”. If a book is occupied you need to pay money (and money’s tight!) to place your worker there. I also love how you can build your workers with special seals to customize their proficiency with certain actions.

**1 - Revive (2022) - 10 / 10**

This catapulted itself to my top 3 of all time this year and was my greatest discovery. I love the engine, the plethora of bonuses you unlock, the card play, and the interplay between the board presence and engine building. Even though the solo mode is uninteresting, I love the game so much that I don't care. My only negative is the identical per-class card art and the ugly gray sides of the box. The Call of the Abyss expansion is not necessary but makes the game even better, giving you more variety and strategic paths to victory.

It was too late to even get enough playables, so I just threw in the Whisperwood Elemental and enough green cards to make a deck. Very little fixing and very little removal, and I was expecting to just get rolled, but somehow ran the table 7-0. The only game that was even remotely close was game 6 against an esper deck who's Silumgar stole my Ob Nixilis but I had enough pressure to win anyways.

A lot of luck and enough bombs will pull any deck together lol.

  
EDIT: I forgot I even drafted Dictate of Erebos because I didn't draw it a single time in any of the 7 games lol. Whisperwood and Ob were good enough.

The first communication that they could read from Jimmy and they knew his time was coming and wanted to be here to see his life force move into the galaxy.  As I have said before, they share only one emotion with us.  Fear, guilt, suffering, anger, hatred are completely foreign to them.  They only understand Gratitude.  Jimmy was full of gratitude.

In my opinion, they either explore this planet and give it a chance (it’s like looking at your dog and the excitement he has in his face when he sees you and you want to give him every opportunity to feel that feeling.) Or, they walk away and allow us to destroy ourselves because we’re not worth it.

I hope it’s the first."

"Jimmy Carter 1977: ""This Voyager spacecraft was constructed by the United States of America.

We are a community of 240 million human beings among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet Earth. We human beings are still divided into nation states, but these states are rapidly becoming a single global civilization.

We cast this message into the cosmos. It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our civilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, some--perhaps many--may have inhabited planets and spacefaring civilizations. If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message:

This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.

> **261 AC, 6th Moon -** Having joined his ships with the royal fleet in King's Landing, the Evenstar meets with members of the Most Devout to petition the Faith's support for establishing a new settlement on Tarth, as well sanctify ground for burials.

> **276 AC -** Intent on having his seat reflect Morne's newfound wealth and prosperity, Selwyn Tarth begins renovating his keep. Much-needed amenities are built, including expanded housing, grain storage, new stables, gardens and a castle sept, but the reserved land quickly proves insufficient in light of the unprecedented growth of the town.

My extreme horror library ,ExtremeHorrorLit,1hn6n8u,2024-12-26 23:15:47,12,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtremeHorrorLit/comments/1hn6n8u/my_extreme_horror_library/,East_Competition1588,Review,"Hello lovelies! This is my library containing all the books I’ve read/TBR/currently reading, what they’re about, and my ratings/opinion (already read only). This is not only for me to keep track, but to hopefully to help someone find something that they would like. They’re placed in no particular order and I will update this list regularly— about every week. 

**CURRENTLY READING**

Zola by D.E. McCluskey
                
           Andrea is trapped in an abusive relationship/household with her son. She also has an unnatural obsession with cheesy, the smellier the better. When she learns that her partner begins abusing her son, she takes extreme measures to ensure it will never happen again. This sends her into a spiral of horrific acts, meanwhile her son becomes a social outcast. 



Raised by a Serial Killer (series, currently on Book 3) by Sea Caummisar

            This series follows the life of Deicide as she grows up under the watchful eye of a serial killer. She shows the extreme punishments she’s forced to endure as well as her mental psyche over time. 

**ALREADY READ**

Talia (Book 1) by Daniel J. Volpe 
            4.6 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Talia joins a seedy underground production company after not being able to make her way as a Broadway actress. Nothing could have prepared her for the depravity of the underbelly of society. It’s very fast pace and it kept me interested. 

It’s a little predictable if you’ve read some of Volpe’s prior works, but still a good little read if you need a distraction. 




Tender is the Flesh by Agustina Bazterrica
             3 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️
             A virus left most animals unable to be eaten, so humans had to turn to another source of food: humans. Marcos is the supervisor of a human slaughtering plant. His wife left him, his father has dementia. He’s given his own human to do what he pleases— which leads to his ultimate downfall. 

I wasn’t a fan of this book— mostly due to some elements within it that made me uncomfortable. It was in regards to the human he was given, some of you may know what I’m talking about if you’ve read the book. It’s kind of weird considering it wasn’t the idea of not being able to eat meat anymore that made me uncomfortable.. Anyway, it was an alright book. A dystopian, if you will. I’m not really interested in things of that nature. It reminded me a lot of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury or The Giver by Lois Lowry. It was a kind of slow burn for me and I like the character conflicts. It’s a good book to read if you like psychological stuff. 




Dead Inside by Chandler Morris
            4 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            A hospital security guard has an unusual appetite for the dead. A doctor has an unusual appetite for the dead— in a different way. They both find an understanding within each other which leads to an unseemly romance and an awful ending

I really loved this book. It was different. I rated it so low on my Goodreads due to peer pressure, but it was something I really wanted to read for awhile and it did not disappoint. I think I just like weird stuff, I don’t think this was a really big favourite amoung anyone else. The unusual appetites they both had got to me a little bit, but it really isn’t that bad if you’ve been in the community. 





The Heretic by Stuart Bray
            2 stars — ⭐️⭐️
            Ren has always been an outcast in regards to his social life. However, when he attends a party, his takes a dark turn towards human depravity

I was a little disappointed by this book. I was just so bored by it. I literally got the description off of Goodreads. It’s a decent read, I guess, if you’re just looking for something to do, but I literally do not even remember what it is about. The editing isn’t great as there are a ton of grammatical issues, it’s as if I’m reading the rough draft. Some people like it, though. It definitely could have been better. 


The Groomer by Jon Athan
            2 stars — ⭐️⭐️
            Andrew becomes protective of his family after he catches a young photographer frequently photographing his young daughter. Soon, the girl disappears without a chase, leading the father down a dangerous and dark rabbit hole in search for his little girl. 

I definitely understood this one. I didn’t really like how the ending turned out, there was definitely a little bit of a plot twist when it came to that. It was an okay read, I wouldn’t call it the best thing ever. If you’re just getting into this and you have a soft spot for kids, this may not be the book for you. 


Obsession by Daniel Lorn
            4 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            An unnamed MC has an obsession to murder someone. 

            I hate that this book was so short. It was a good concept and executed very well. As someone with OCD, the obsession that the MC has is so unique and very well written. The negative thoughts felt very real to me, I felt like I was the MC. It’s very similar to my own compulsive/obsessive thoughts and I felt like it was very well written and it’s a short read if you just want to read something. 



Daddy’s Girl by Anton Palmer
            4 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            A child brought up by her religious zealot of a father who enforced brutal punishments to ensure the utmost submission. As a grown woman with her father dead, the girl— while psychologically damaged— must learn how to navigate the world and learn how to function as a normal person. However, when she discovers her husband is having an affair, she slips back into her old ways. 

             This was such a depraved book and I can’t imagine how many people actually live like this. It was super cool seeing an author do a good job transitioning from a character’s youth to a character’s adulthood. I feel like that’s a really hard thing to capture. The torture was also a really good read to me, this was one of my introductory books to extreme horror and I definitely think it was the perfect way to ease into it. 



Lovesick by Jon Athan
            4 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Mark is still in love with his girlfriend, Rebecca. Rebecca, however, feels as if their love has shriveled out and is even seeing a new guy. Mark knows about it. Mark knows about everything. And he has a plan to deal with it: making her sick. Extremely sick. 

            I loved this book! It was so horrific as it was so close to a situation that I’ve seen in real life. I think the book was the perfect length and its somewhat relatable (not the crazy parts, ofc, but if you read it you’ll know.) I personally am a Jon Athan fan, so I’m slightly biased. I feel the desperation from the characters and it’s something really cool. It was also cool to see the character execute his plans so well and just watch everything pan out. The character is so meticulous and careful, so much different than a lot of the other MCs I see. 



Broken Pieces of June by Stuart Bray (series)
            3 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️
            June is part of the underground adult video industry, where she caters to more.. heinous interests. 

            It was alright. The characters are decently written, the story line is kind of predictable to me. It’s similar to the rest of Bray’s book, so if you like that sort of thing then by all means go for it! I kind of feel like things went downhill after the first book. It carried the same plot throughout, but by 3/4 of book one I kind of wanted to just get through it and not read the other two books in the series. It plays on the idea of an underground adult film industry and he adds no real differentiation than what else is out there. It reminded me of a lesser Talia at some points. It’s not horrible, but I wouldn’t pick it off the shelf willingly again. 



Magnum Opus by Caitlin Marceau
            3.5 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Charlotte has written a book and is excited to publish it. Her friend—a fellow author who she is extremely jealous of— makes an announcement that leads to Charlotte possessing a fatal envy. 

           Again, it’s alright. I would pick this one back up if I was extremely bored. It’s a short read, but I feel like it was packed with enough emotion to make the length alright. I think everyone has had the sense of envy at some point, while not as extreme, and had a friend that you envied so much because of how successful they were. This is kind of like that in writing and I think Marceau may have been writing from experience. 



Cotton Candy by Stuart Bray
            4 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Gavin is a gay prostitute in New York in the 1990s. When he meets Mr. Nobody, he goes to his own “wonderland” he is led down a dark spiral. 

           I’m a sucker for a good romance and this book had that, which is a big reason why I gave it four stars. The ‘relationship’ Gavin had seemed so sweet and genuine to me, beyond the typical client-and-provider interactions. It was also a little bit gnarly and it held some elements aside from just horror, so there’s a little bit for everyone! It’s not as dark as some other stories, in my opinion, and it’s a great beginning book when starting out in this genre.



Ensuring Your Place in Hell by Stephen Cooper, Otis Bateman, Stuart Bray
            3 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️
            These are short stories about edge lords who are addicted with becoming big names on the dark web, a kidney stone eating abuser who’s hungry for his next meal, and the Golden Cumpuss. 

            I definitely liked some stories in this one more than others. There’s only three I believe. The Golden Cumpuss was actually really interesting, the concept was cool and I think it should be expanded upon in later books if it hasn’t been already. I definitely think they tried to make it sound more intimidating than it actually is. The edge lords have been stuck in my head since I read it, it was such a random read I would definitely do it again just for the hilarity of it. 



Psychic Teenage Bloodbath (series) by Carl John Lee
            4 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Susan Ward is in a coma. She’s been there since the accident, she cannot move or speak. However, in the deep recesses of her mind she discovers a frightening new skill that leads to a horrific vengeance. 

             This book was one of the first real novels I read that had a good story line and had me excited to read the second novel. While the second novel didn’t exactly live up to my expectations, it wasn’t horrible. I just liked the uniqueness of the first one a little bit more and I believe it wore off. I genuinely felt bad for everyone involved, Susan, Charlie, and the innocent bystanders. Also we love a good WLW story! It’s filled to the brim with gore, murder, emotional climaxes, and so much more!! I absolutely plan on reading this again at some point. The 70s feel from the cover arts intertwined with the great characters and fun story line are so different than anything else out there. A MANDATORY read IMO!



Eaten by Evil by Ash Ericmore
            3.5 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Sally is brought into the world of prostitution and drugs my her boyfriend. Her boyfriend abuses her. She’s on heroin. She joins the film industry. It dives into the British underbelly where she has to fight back or die trying. 

            Another not bad book. I loved the ending, I feel like there aren’t a lot of endings like it. I live for the dark, gloomy stuff, but sometimes a bit of change is nice. I felt super bad for the main character as well, I feel like a lot of people are in that situation right now and it really got me in my feels. Maybe I’m just sensitive. However, it’s not the best thing out there. It was a bit too fast pace, I think they could have gone into it a bit more. The storytelling is good regardless. I highly recommend it. 



My Vagina Smells Like Sulfur by Sea Caummisar
            2.5 stars — ⭐️⭐️
            A dark web divinity counselor has convinced people that the trick to the afterlife isn’t how you lived, but how you died. The more creative the death, the better. She claims that she has proof of a dead person living their best life after death as well, leading to a death spiral for both her and her audience. 

           A little bit cringe, I must say. It reminds me of the vent stories I would write as an edgy teen. A lot of Caummisar’s books are though. It definitely should have been ran by an editor a few more times, but I believe she self publishes, so with that in mind it’s okay. It’s just kind of dark and the title seemed weird which is why I picked it up. I wouldn’t recommend it if you were asking me for a book, but it’s there. I’m not embarrassed for reading it. A very much “WTF” kind of book. Honestly, there’s no describing it and if you want to get a grip on the author then this is a good introductory book to her. It’s not bad it’s just really really not good. 



Billy Silver by Daniel J Volpe
            4 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Billy is a lowlife druggie that needs cash for his next fix. However, after losing his girlfriend and getting kicked out of his band, he’s left looking for his next move. When a new tattoo shop opens offering money for flesh, he takes it. He is tattooed by the mysterious Talia and begins to descend into a miserable life of craving violence until he cannot take it anymore and takes everyone down with him. 

           I think I love it so much because it was my first ever extreme horror novel and nothing has beaten it for me. I love the storyline, the characters, the grotesque nature. I will admit, some of the plot points could have just been better and the characters aren’t always the best, but nothing will beat a first. For me, anyway. I also love the Talia reference and the idea she’s still working on her goal. Volpe is just one of my favourite writers. 



Left to You by Daniel J Volpe
            5 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Robert’s mother is ill with an aggressive cancer. When he confines in an elderly man who frequents the diner he works at, he is given an out to cure his mother, but at what cost?

            My first extreme horror NOVEL. It’s such an in-depth book it’s a masterpiece and another REQUIRED reading. I was not prepared for the gore or the backstories or the characters. I was not prepared for anything and I was shocked. This was also my second ever extreme horror book and nothing has topped it yet. The OLD MAN??? Superb. Genuinely, I cannot go into any more or else I will spoil this book. It’s more than just a splatterpunk/extreme horror book, it’s a heartbreaking, horrific, unforgetting story of love, sacrifice, and death. A lot of it. 



Gone To See The River Man by Kristopher Triana
            4.7 stars — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
            Super fans. Groupies. Stalkers. These people will give anything for the idols they worship, be they rock stars, actors or authors. Or even serial killers. Lori is just such a fanatic. Her obsession is with Edmund Cox, a man of sadistic cruelty who butchered more than twenty women. She's gone so far as to forge a relationship with him, visiting him in prison and sending him letters on a regular basis. She will do anything to get close to him, so when he gives her a task, she eagerly accepts it. She has no idea of the horror that awaits her. Edmund tells her she must go to his cabin in the woods of Killen and retrieve a key to deliver to a mysterious figure known only as The River Man. In her quest, she brings along her handicapped sister, and they journey through the deep, dark valley, beginning their trip upriver. The trip quickly becomes a surreal nightmare, one that digs up Lori's personal demons, the ones she feels bonds her to Edmund. The river runs with flesh, the cabin is a vault of horrors, and ghostly blues music echoes through the mountains. Soon they will learn that The River Man is not quite fact or folklore, and definitely not human -- at least, not anymore. And the key is just the beginning of what is required of Lori to prove she's worthy of a madman's love.

            This was sick to say the least. I wouldn’t ever read it again. With that said, it’s a really good book. The themes were just too much for me. I have a pure and genuine rage for Lori and nothing can justify her actions. Read at your own risks, it’s definitely not for the faint of heart.

Penpal by Dathan Auerbach

            Penpal began as a series of short and interconnected stories posted on an online horror forum. Before long, it was adapted into illustrations, audio recordings, and short films; and that was before it was revised and expanded into a novel! How much do you remember about your childhood? In Penpal, a man investigates the seemingly unrelated bizarre, tragic, and horrific occurrences of his childhood in an attempt to finally understand them. Beginning with only fragments of his earliest years, you'll follow the narrator as he discovers that these strange and horrible events are actually part of a single terrifying story that has shaped the entirety of his life and the lives of those around him. If you've ever stayed in the woods just a little too long after dark, if you've ever had the feeling that someone or something was trying to hurt you, if you remember the first friend you ever made and how strong that bond was, then Penpal is a story that you won't soon forget, despite how you might try.



Butcher by Joyce Carol Oates

            From one of our most accomplished storytellers, an extraordinary and arresting novel about a women's asylum in the nineteenth century, and a terrifying doctor who wants to change the world In this harrowing story based on authentic historical documents, we follow the career of Dr.
Silas Weir, ""Father of Gyno-Psychiatry,"" as he ascends from professional anonymity to national renown. Humiliated by a procedure gone terribly wrong, Weir is forced to take a position at the New Jersey Asylum for Female Lunatics, where he reigns. There, he is allowed to continue his practice, unchecked for decades, making a name for himself by focusing on women who have been neglected by the state-women he subjects to the most grotesque modes of experimentation. As he begins to establish himself as a pioneer of nineteenth-century surgery, Weir's ambition is fueled by his obsessive fascination with a young Irish indentured servant named Brigit, who becomes not only Weir's primary experimental subject, but also the agent of his destruction. Narrated by Silas Weir's eldest son, who has repudiated his father's brutal legacy, Butcher is a unique blend of fiction and fact, a nightmare voyage through the darkest regions of the American psyche conjoined, in its startling conclusion, with unexpected romance.

The Stork by Morgan Wilder 
            
            ""THIS IS A MATTER BETWEEN YOU AND I. NO ONE ELSE.""

Calliope leads a pathetic life. Stuck in a dead-end petrol station job and uninterested in Lee, the man she's been sort-of dating, it feels like life's moved on without her. One day, on the way to a diner to meet him, she witnesses a stork with sharp teeth feed on a baby. At first, she's unsure of what she saw, but then it visits her in the night. It's out for her heart. Trapped in a brutal, long-drawn game of mind tricks, occasional intense fights, and what seems like a never-ending deadlock, Calliope must use her strength and wits to defeat it. Or die trying.



Mister Magic by Kiersten White
            
            Who is Mister Magic? Former child stars reunite to uncover the tragedy that ended their show-and discover the secret of its enigmatic host-in this dark supernatural thriller from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Hide. Thirty years after a tragic accident shut down production of the classic children's program Mister Magic, the five surviving cast members have done their best to move on. But just as generations of cultishly devoted fans still cling to the lessons they learned from the show, the cast, known as the Circle of Friends, have spent their lives searching for the happiness they felt while they were on it. The friendship. The feeling of belonging. And the protection of Mister Magic. But with no surviving video of the show, no evidence of who directed or produced it, and no records of who-or what-the beloved host actually was, memories are all the former Circle of Friends has. Then a twist of fate brings the castmates back together at the remote desert filming compound that feels like it's been waiting for them all this time. Even though they haven't seen each other for years, they understand one another better than anyone has since. After all, they're the only ones who hold the secret of that circle, the mystery of the magic man in his infinitely black cape, and, maybe, the answers to what really happened on that deadly last day. But as the Circle of Friends reclaim parts of their past, they begin to wonder: Are they here by choice, or have they been lured into a trap? Because magic never forgets the taste of your friendship...




Marinara

            A group of teens break into an arcade-pizzeria for the night of their lives, only to find themselves trapped and hunted by the bloodthirsty animatronic band in this explosive debut YA horror novel. A unique mix of comedy and coming-of-age love story that dives straight into nightmare fuel, MARINARA is sure to be a favorite of those who grew up with Five Nights at Freddy's or Fear St. It's the 1980s. Ben Cooper works at Marinara, an independently owned arcade-pizzeria on the outskirts of his middle-of-nowhere town. Ben's the type of kid who passes up house parties to rent movies from Blockbuster. He's never stood out from the crowd and that's why he's going to throw the greatest graduation party of all time. His forever crush Sarah is attending too, so it's the perfect setting to finally let her know how he's always felt about her. Ben and five friends sneak into Marinara after hours for a night of endless tokens, booze, and make-your-own-pizzas-not to mention front row seats to the creepy animatronic band, Meaty and the Toppings. But when ""It's Showtime!"" blasts from the stage speaker, Meaty and his bloodthirsty gang are released one by one into the shadows, and laughs instantly turn into screams. Amongst the chaos, a message in blood is found on a bathroom mirror and a mystery will collide past with present. Trapped and faced with death, lifelong friends will be forced to take sides. Some will hide while others will fight as monsters hide in the darkness. Pushed both mentally and physically farther than they ever thought possible, Ben and Sarah will fight for one another every step of the way as they try to survive their impending doom. Uncover the Janitor's Vintage newspaper clippings are scattered throughout to further enhance the mystery.
But can YOU solve the twist ending of what really happened that fateful night at Marinara?



They Eat You From The Inside by Jacob Perrett

            Don Plath has always struggled to stay true to himself. When his boyfriend, Skylar, invites him across the state to meet his parents, Don embarks on the reluctant journey, his demons hanging in the back of his mind in the form of endless spiders. After their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, the two are forced to seek help from a backwoods family whose intentions become increasingly sinister.


The Trees Grew Because I Bled There by Eric LaRocca

            A beautifully crafted, devastating short fiction collection from the Bram-Stoker finalist and author of Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke and Other Misfortunes.
Eight stories of literary dark fiction from a master storyteller. Exploring the shadow side of love, these are tales of grief, obsession, control. Intricate examinations of trauma and tragedy in raw, poetic prose. In these narratives, a woman imagines horrific scenarios whilst caring for her infant niece; on-line posts chronicle a cancer diagnosis; a couple in the park with their small child encounter a stranger with horrific consequences; a toxic relationship reaches a terrifying resolution... Originally published under the title The Strange Thing We Become and Other Dark Tales, this is a much-praised collection of deeply unsettling, painfully dark tales.

Exquisite Corpse by Poppy Z Brite

            To serial slayer Andrew Compton, murder is an art, the most intimate art. After feigning his own death to escape from prison, Compton makes his way to the United States with the sole ambition of bringing his ""art"" to new heights. Tortured by his own perverse desires, and drawn to possess and destroy young boys, Compton inadvertently joins forces with Jay Byrne, a dissolute playboy who has pushed his ""art"" to limits even Compton hadn't previously imagined. Together, Compton and Byrne set their sights on an exquisite young Vietnamese-American runaway, Tran, whom they deem to be the perfect victim. Swiftly moving from the grimy streets of London's Piccadilly Circus to the decadence of the New Orleans French Quarter, and punctuated by rants from radio talk show host Lush Rimbaud, a.k.a. Luke Ransom, Tran's ex-lover, who is dying of AIDS and who intends to wreak ultimate havoc before leaving this world, Exquisite Corpse unfolds into a labyrinth of murder and love. Ultimately all four characters converge on a singular bloody night after which their lives will be irrevocably changed - or terminated. Poppy Z. Brite dissects the landscape of torture and invites us into the mind of a killer. Exquisite Corpse confirms Brite as a writer who defies categorization. It is a novel for those who dare trespass where the sacred and profane become one.




Depraved by Bryan Smith

            Welcome to Hopkins Bend, the remote little Tennessee town where the backwoods inhabitants are cannibals and the local law operates a sex-trafficking ring. Unlucky travelers are frequently ensnared in the town's sinister web. Some are held captive and tortured while others face even more gruesome fates. And beneath it all is the town's darkest secret, the curse of the depraved and mutated Kincher clan.

Wanted to start a discussion on what y’all think might be the future of Safemoon!

Personally, I reckon VGX are planning a quiet relaunch of the token sometime next year, after they’ve re-released the wallet.

I’m hoping that they’ll continue where the previous team left off with the blockchain that was in development too, and that exchange that was promised - on the safemoon site I think there are small mentions of both, by VGX, stating slyly that they’re planning on taking it all and running with it.

What’re everybody’s thoughts?"

Let’s push this subreddit!,SafeMoonV2,1hghcfx,2024-12-17 13:33:14,5,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeMoonV2/comments/1hghcfx/lets_push_this_subreddit/,Lanky-Relation-4404,,"Hey, so with the contract being quietly activated again (a very positive thing - if it were announced there could have been a lot of sales that would have completely ruined the token considering the near-nothing liquidity at the time) and locked liquidity being silently added (same deal as the contract - it’s a very positive thing it’s not only been added, but that it’s been done quietly), I truly believe that VGX are planning a relaunch of the safemoon token early next year. I feel they might be wanting to capitalise off their new acquisition, which goes without saying, it’d only be in their best interests to do so!

With that being said, I’m calling for the 10 people we have here in this subreddit to start spreading the word and try to get this subreddit to grow! The old safemoon subreddit is full of people that don’t fully understand everything and it’s full of negativity and trolls. Let’s try and grow this thing from the ground up and create a new community of positivity and informed discussion?

"An Update, Suggestion, and a Question",SafeMoon,1hf5df9,2024-12-15 18:25:29,28,0.92,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/1hf5df9/an_update_suggestion_and_a_question/,Evening-Exam9326,Information / News,"I noticed some people mentioning trading and reflections have resumed.  I figured I'd see the state of things for myself, so naturally I went on Discord, where I get all important information.

I walked away from that with the impression that some people are still irrationally certain that Safemoon will achieve a new ATH and the impression that the available evidence I saw on Discord suggests that VGX either is incompetent or has abandoned the project altogether, in my opinion.

Here is some of what I saw. 

* The Safemoon Wallet beta test seems to be on hold.  Everyone talking about it is saying it doesn't work and can't get any help from staff.  No one knows what's going on.  I tried the wallet myself, and it wouldn't let me register; basically, I couldn't get past the login page.
* The Discord is virtually abandoned by the staff.  Many of the old staff who used to engage with the Discord server community and help have either quit or resigned.  No staff or admin will respond to you.  The support ticket function has been deliberately turned off.
* Someone with admin permission on Discord does come on there from time to time and read some posts; there is clear evidence of that.  However, that person simply ignores everyone (including those asking for help with the beta wallet).  I get the impression that the project is abandoned and whoever is running the server is too scared or embarrassed to say anything.
* The server is dead.  The members barely engage, and the staff doesn't engage at all virtually.
* The old staff do talk on occasion; they seem to know something, but they aren't divulging it.  It's all quite bizarre and childish.

I highly suggest that everyone still holding a bag or even considering buying more SFM do a thorough assessment of the objective facts and make a rational choice.  I highly doubt God is telling you to hodl SFM, which is a sentiment I've noticed some harbor.  I've always said that Safemoon tokens are lottery tickets, but after checking out VGX, I now say buying Safemoon is like buying a lottery ticket for last week's drawing from a drunk homeless man who just pulled it from the trash bin.

Does anyone have any counter evidence that VGX isn't incompetent and hasn't abandoned the project?  I'm fully open to my Discord investigation being proven wrong."

Havent seen much about this archetype so figured Id post this deck. Boy did it overperform. You can go over the top so quickly.

Alpha Authority + Sungrace Pegasus is basically unbeatable with another aura to follow it up. Hero of Iroas is of course awesome. Leafcrown dryad is the perfect bread-and-butter card, great as a 2 drop and great as an aura. I was excited to try gladecover scout, but the other targets are just so much better I never put any auras on it."
"Evil Beckons, Epic Campaign Mode",lotrlcg,1heazqa,2024-12-14 14:55:49,18,0.92,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/1heazqa/evil_beckons_epic_campaign_mode/,HyperbolicLetdown,,"Cross-posting this from boardgamegeek.

I've spent a lot of time developing this custom campaign mode and I want to share it with the community. I love this game, but being the first LCG there are weaknesses that can be improved on. I really enjoyed the Tale of Years campaign variant that spans all scenarios in the game, inspired by the saga campaign mode, but I never liked the idea that there are only consequences for scraping by a win and not losing. I've made so many modifications while playing it that it turned into its own thing. The biggest inspirations were Arkham Horror LCG and Pandemic Legacy. It is based on playing two handed, but can be re-balanced for any number of fellowships. I also created one for Marvel LCG which I'll post over there. I hope it helps improve your experience with the game!

**Start**

Reset progress from any previous campaign  
Goal: Complete an epic campaign (all scenarios) with two fellowships  
Begins with a Long Rest at the Shire to Scout for starting heroes or Quest  
Most official campaign rules can be used with this, but ignore any mention of switching heroes out without incurring a penalty

**Hero Selection**

All heroes in your collection are part of a campaign pool.  
New heroes may be drawn from the pool during Rests and swapped in with the current heroes.  
Other versions of heroes may be swapped in any time at no cost.  
If a hero is killed or corrupted, add a hero scouted at the last Rest, or add any MotK ally.  
May optionally decline the drawn hero and continue with one less.  
If an objective ally matches a hero in play, draw a new hero and swap them in for free.  
If heroes and MotK allies run out, you lose the campaign.  
There is no restriction on changing player cards or contracts.  
Note how and where heroes die in the campaign log for added flavor!

**Advancing**

Win the scenario to advance to the next one.  
Defeated heroes suffer trauma, win or lose

**Physical Trauma**

When a hero is defeated, suffer 1 physical trauma (PT)  
If the heroes win, but one hero is defeated, that hero still suffers 1 PT.  
Heroes start play with 1 damage token on them for every 3 PT  
Characters are permanently killed if PT equals triple their HP

Allies don’t suffer additional PT, unless Messenger of the King is used  
Allies enter play with 1 damage token for every 3 trauma on the character

**Mental Trauma**

When a fellowship is defeated by threat or scenario effect, each remaining hero suffers 1 mental trauma (MT)  
Each fellowship starts with Doom 1 for every \[# of heroes\] MT  
Characters are permanently “corrupted” if MT equals \[20 – Threat\]

If any heroes are corrupted, add an Evil Beckons treachery to every encounter deck  
“When revealed: Draw a random hero that is corrupted and move it to the staging area.  
Hero loses the hero card type and gains the enemy card type with  
threat equal to its willpower, and engagement cost equal to its threat cost. Add 1 damage for every 3 PT.  
If the corrupted hero is defeated, record 1 PT in the campaign log. If PT equals triple their HP, they are permanently killed.  
This effect cannot be canceled. Remove Evil Beckons from the game”

Allies don’t suffer additional MT, unless Messenger of the King is used  
Allies gain “Raise your threat by 1 for every 3 MT on this ally as an additional cost to play it.”

**Trauma Exceptions**

Boromir and Caldara don’t suffer PT for their card abilities if they win the scenario  
Any character that is mentioned later in the story is “incapacitated” instead of killed/corrupted. They heal 1 trauma upon return.  
Bilbo, Frodo, and Aragorn special heroes can earn trauma up to one short of death or corruption.

**Handicap**

Losing a scenario increases the HC level by 1  
Winning a scenario reduces the HC level by 2 (0 minimum)  
For each HC level, each fellowship may choose any of the following:  
\--Draw 1 card  
\--Add 1 resource to a hero

**Victory Points**

Cards in the victory display at the end of the scenario earn victory points, win or lose  
VP may be spent on the following  
10 VP: Draw 1 card during setup  
10 VP: Add 1 resource to a hero during setup  
50 VP: Mend: Heal 1 PT  
50 VP: Calm: Heal 1 MT

**Long Rest**

\-Heroes may be traded in/out  
\-Choose 9 (repeats allowed):  
\---Mend: Heal 1 PT  
\---Calm: Heal 1 MT  
\---Scout: Draw 2 heroes to choose from this rest  
\---Quest: Victory 10

**Short Rest**

\-Heroes may be traded in/out  
\-Choose 3 (repeats allowed):  
\---Mend: Heal 1 PT  
\---Calm: Heal 1 MT  
\---Scout: Draw 2 heroes to choose from this rest  
\---Quest: Victory 10

**Interlude**

Remove 1 PT and 1 MT from every hero

**Breaking of the Fellowship (optional)**

After the Breaking of the Fellowship scenario, the campaign is split into two parties: Aragorn Path and Frodo Path.  
Each is tracked separately with its own experience and penalties.  
Player 1-2 continue with Aragorn. The Frodo Path introduces Player 3-4.  
Heroes, unique allies, and unique attachments must be committed to either path when the fellowship breaks.  
Additional Rest action:  
\---Send: Move 2 characters to the opposite path. Each may bring 1 attachment.  
Player may choose for Frodo’s Choice. This determines which heroes and unique cards start on the Frodo path  
Istari allies may support either path from a distance.  
Fallen into Evil, once drawn, is given to the hero chosen for future attempts unless they are killed. They can’t be swapped out.  
If Fallen into Evil is not revealed by 4A, search the deck/discard and reveal it.  
Once Breaking of the Fellowship is cleared, the hero with Fallen into Evil is Corrupted and gains a PT if defeated.

**Lore**

If the party meets a hero just before a rest, that hero can drawn in placing of drawing a random one.

**Special Cases**

When using Messenger of the King, any ally may be chosen in place of drawing a random hero  
If played with errors, determine if win was still likely with correct play. If not, forfeit and reset conditions to the beginning.  
If a mistake is discovered after playing the next scenario, just move on.  
You can optionally use the thematic heroes list from the Tale of Years campaign and add/remove them to your pool as you play.

"Unable to Access ""JUP"" and ""VGX"" Tokens on Coinbase – No Help from Support",CoinBase,1hc4nsz,2024-12-11 16:30:56,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1hc4nsz/unable_to_access_jup_and_vgx_tokens_on_coinbase/,surajnewatia,,"I’m experiencing the same issue on [u/Coinbase](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coinbase/). Previously, I was able to trade ""JUP"" and ""VGX"" tokens on the Coinbase exchange, but now those tokens are no longer tradable. I can’t buy, sell, or convert them on the platform anymore.

The Coinbase exchange app indicates that these tokens are still tradable via Coinbase Wallet. However, when I try to open the wallet from the exchange, it redirects me to Coinbase Wallet and asks me to swap my assets for JUP/VGX (which I don’t want to do). I also can’t send my JUP or VGX tokens from the exchange to the wallet.

I’ve contacted Coinbase support, but they haven’t been able to provide any useful assistance. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how did you resolve it? Would appreciate any advice or help!"
