* The Earth is at the center of the universe  
* The Sun, Moon, planets, and stars orbit the Earth  
* The geocentric model was the dominant model for centuries  
* The geocentric model used epicycles and deferents to explain the orbits of planets and the Moon  
* The geocentric model produced errors in predicting planetary positions  

Heliocentric model

* The Sun is at the center of the solar system  
* The Earth and other planets orbit the Sun  
* The heliocentric model was proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543  
* The heliocentric model solved many problems with the geocentric model, including retrograde motion  

Copernicus first proposed the Heliocentric model in his book ""De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium"" (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly **Spheres**), while Galileo used his telescope to observe celestial bodies and gather evidence that supported the Copernican theory. 



Using Hedera’s public mainnet Layer 1 DLT network as “the Sun” and Hashgraph’s private subnets (hashspheres) as “celestial bodies” (heavenly spheres) within a solar system (ecosystem), I’m attempting to create a metaphor/allegory/analogy using the antiquated Geocentric viewpoint vs the modern Heliocentric observation of the universe to define the conceptual relationship between Hedera’s centric Public Mainnet and the use of private orbital Subnets (Hashspheres), and to illustrate the relationship parallels between Public Hedera Mainnet and Private Subnet Hashspheres in the world of DLT to the observable universe on both a galactic scale and a molecular scale. 



Further, I will be attempting to illustrate Leemon’s concept of “spheres” based on this analogy of Geocentric vs Heliocentric, and how he's attempting to introduce a paradigm shift leveraging the trinity of (1) public Hedera, (2) private Hashspheres, and (3) open-sourced Hiero - how they can together form the decentralized “trust layer of the internet” underpinned by Hashgraph as the trust anchor for “the internet of value”. 

  
**The Copernican Revolution as an Allegory for Hedera’s Ecosystem**



**Prologue**:

In the same way that the Copernican Revolution shifted humanity’s understanding of the cosmos—from the **Earth-centered geocentric model** to the **Sun-centered heliocentric model**—Hedera’s ecosystem redefines how public and private distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks coexist. The Hedera public mainnet acts as the **“Sun,”** the unchanging and central source of trust and governance, while private Hashsphere subnets represent the **“celestial bodies,”** orbiting and interacting with this core in a dynamic, interconnected system.



This metaphor can be further explored by examining parallels on both a **galactic scale** (the macrocosm of the observable universe) and a **molecular scale** (the microcosm of interconnected atoms and molecules).



**Geocentrism vs. Heliocentrism: The Shift from Fragmented Systems to a Unified Core**

1. **Geocentric Model – Fragmented Legacy Systems**:

The **geocentric view** places Earth at the center of the universe, where all celestial bodies revolve around it in fixed, hierarchical paths. Similarly, legacy systems and fragmented DLT solutions operate as **isolated, siloed systems**, each functioning as its own center of gravity. These systems demand significant trust within their boundaries, struggle to interoperate with others, and often duplicate efforts unnecessarily.

2. **Heliocentric Model – Hedera’s Vision**:

The Copernican model placed the **Sun** at the center, with planets revolving around it in harmony, governed by consistent natural laws. Hedera’s public mainnet is analogous to the **Sun**—a central, immutable trust layer that anchors the ecosystem. The **private Hashsphere subnets** orbit this core, just as planets, moons, and other celestial bodies revolve around the Sun. This shift enables efficient interaction, shared trust, and interoperability across a distributed “solar system” of applications.



**Galactic Scale: Hedera’s Mainnet as the Sun in a Distributed Solar System**



On a cosmic scale, the **Sun** is the gravitational anchor for the entire solar system, much like the Hedera mainnet serves as the **trust anchor** for its ecosystem. Private Hashsphere subnets are like **planets and moons**, each designed to meet specific purposes but ultimately dependent on the Sun’s consistent gravitational force.

1. **The Sun (Hedera Public Mainnet)**:

• Provides **centralized trust** in a decentralized manner, offering predictable and immutable consensus for all interacting systems.

• Powers the “energy” (trust and security) that flows into the rest of the ecosystem.

• Acts as the unifying force, ensuring that all Hashsphere subnets, though private, remain grounded in the same foundational principles of security and verifiability.

2. **Planets and Moons (Hashspheres)**:

• **Planets** represent major industries or sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance, supply chain) utilizing private subnets for customized, permissioned operations.

• **Moons** orbiting these planets represent smaller, specialized sub-networks or specific applications within an industry.

• These celestial bodies interact with the public mainnet to **synchronize trust**, submit periodic proofs, or anchor key data while maintaining independence in their day-to-day operations.

3. **Asteroids and Comets (Ephemeral Use Cases)**:

Smaller, transient use cases or experimental systems can be thought of as **asteroids or comets**—intermittently interacting with the mainnet or other Hashspheres when needed but not requiring permanent orbits.



**Key Parallel:**



The Sun (mainnet) does not dictate the movement or function of the planets (Hashspheres) but enables their stability, ensuring the ecosystem operates within a predictable and harmonious framework.



**Molecular Scale: Hashgraph as the Atomic Model of Connectivity**



On a molecular scale, the **Hedera mainnet** and **Hashspheres** resemble the structure of an **atom**, where the public ledger serves as the **nucleus** and the private subnets operate as **orbiting electrons**. This analogy highlights the principles of interaction, interdependence, and scalability:

1. **Nucleus (Hedera Mainnet)**:

• The nucleus contains **protons and neutrons**, representing the **governing council** and the foundational principles of Hedera (security, decentralization, and scalability).

• It is the source of **strong nuclear force**, binding the ecosystem together and ensuring that all interactions remain anchored in trust.

2. **Electrons (Hashspheres)**:

• Electrons revolve around the nucleus at different energy levels, akin to **private Hashsphere subnets** operating with varying degrees of autonomy and specificity.

• While electrons may remain localized, their behavior is governed by the nucleus’s central force, ensuring consistency in their interactions with other systems.

• Electrons can also transition between energy levels (interoperability), representing the ability of Hashspheres to interact with other subnets or the public mainnet.



**Key Parallel:**



Just as the atom achieves stability through the balance of forces between its nucleus and electrons, Hedera achieves ecosystem stability through the interplay of the mainnet’s trust layer and the independence of private Hashspheres.



**Observable Universe: Interactions Between Mainnet and Subnets**



In both the galactic and molecular analogies, the relationship between Hedera’s public mainnet and private Hashsphere subnets reflects the principles of **interconnectivity**, **scalability**, and **specialization**:

1. **Anchored Trust**:

Just as celestial bodies remain gravitationally bound to the Sun, Hashspheres anchor to Hedera’s public mainnet for **immutability and consensus.** This ensures trust even in private, permissioned environments.

2. **Independent Functionality**:

Planets or electrons function independently within their own orbits, analogous to how private subnets can customize governance, privacy, and operational rules while occasionally syncing with the mainnet.

3. **Dynamic Interoperability**:

Celestial bodies and molecular particles interact with each other through gravitational or electromagnetic forces. Similarly, Hashspheres interact not only with the mainnet but also with other subnets, forming a web of **interoperable ecosystems**.



**The Broader Vision: A New Cosmic Order for Distributed Systems**



The geocentric worldview represented a fragmented and Earth-centered perspective, limiting humanity’s understanding of the universe. Similarly, legacy systems and siloed DLT networks represent an outdated model of decentralized technology. The heliocentric revolution redefined humanity’s perspective, much like Hedera’s ecosystem aims to create a **solar system** of interconnected networks revolving around a central trust layer.



**Hedera’s public mainnet is the “Sun” of this digital cosmos, with Hashsphere subnets as the “celestial bodies” that rely on its gravitational pull to maintain harmony, scalability, and interoperability. Together, they form a unified yet diverse ecosystem—a trust-based solar system for the decentralized internet.**

  


**From Geocentrism to Heliocentrism: Hedera and the Evolution of Blockchain**



The early days of blockchain technology have largely resembled a **geocentric system**—fragmented, siloed, and centered on isolated networks. Each blockchain operates as its own “center of the universe,” with limited ability to interact with other systems. While these silos have enabled early innovation, they also perpetuate inefficiencies, duplication of efforts, and challenges with interoperability. Hedera Hashgraph, with its public mainnet as the trust anchor and its concept of **Hashspheres** (specialized private subnets), offers a paradigm shift. This new model mirrors the **heliocentric revolution**, transitioning blockchain from a fragmented geocentric state into a dynamic, interoperable, and unified ecosystem akin to a solar system.



**The Geocentric State of Blockchain**



In the geocentric era of blockchain, networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others act as **self-contained systems**, each viewing itself as the center of gravity. These systems prioritize their own ecosystems, requiring developers and enterprises to choose between chains or operate within the constraints of specific protocols. This leads to a number of inefficiencies:

1. **Lack of Interoperability**: Blockchains struggle to communicate with one another, limiting the flow of value and data across ecosystems.

2. **Duplicated Efforts**: Every network reinvents core functions, creating isolated solutions rather than shared infrastructure.

3. **Fragmented Trust**: Each network demands trust from its participants, but this trust does not extend beyond its own boundaries.



Much like the pre-Copernican worldview, where Earth was mistakenly thought to be the center of the universe, this siloed approach fails to leverage the broader potential of interconnected systems.



**Hedera’s Heliocentric Vision**



Hedera represents a **Copernican shift**, placing a **public trust layer**—the Hedera mainnet—at the center of the blockchain universe. This heliocentric model envisions private and permissioned networks, known as **Hashspheres**, revolving around this immutable trust anchor. The interplay between the public mainnet and private subnets ensures scalability, specialization, and interoperability without compromising on security or decentralization.

1. **Hedera as the Sun**:

Hedera’s public mainnet serves as the **gravitational core** of this ecosystem. It provides the trust, consensus, and transparency required for decentralized applications while maintaining high throughput, low fees, and environmental efficiency. Like the Sun, the mainnet’s reliability ensures stability for all systems that interact with it.

2. **Hashspheres as Celestial Bodies**:

Hashspheres are **customizable private sub-networks** that orbit the Hedera mainnet. These subnets allow enterprises and developers to create tailored solutions, whether for privacy, compliance, or industry-specific needs. By anchoring periodically to the public mainnet, they ensure integrity and synchronization while maintaining autonomy.

3. **Interoperability as a Universal Force**:

In this model, Hashspheres are not isolated planets but interconnected celestial bodies. They can interact with each other, exchange data, and bridge assets across ecosystems, creating a **harmonized network of networks.**



**The Path Toward Interoperability**



The heliocentric model transforms blockchain by addressing the limitations of geocentrism:

• **Unified Trust**: With the Hedera mainnet as the trust anchor, networks no longer need to operate independently. Hashspheres inherit security and verifiability from the public layer, reducing the need for redundant mechanisms.

• **Scalability Through Specialization**: Hashspheres enable industries to build tailored solutions while remaining interoperable with the broader ecosystem. This mirrors how planets maintain individual characteristics while revolving in harmony around the Sun.

• **Global Interoperability**: By creating a universal standard for interaction, Hashspheres bridge blockchains, enterprise systems, and legacy technologies, driving adoption beyond isolated ecosystems.



**A Universal Model for Blockchain**



Hedera and Hashspheres offer a blueprint for a decentralized future that mirrors the dynamic and interconnected nature of the universe. The geocentric blockchain systems of today, while revolutionary in their own right, limit the broader potential of distributed ledger technology. By transitioning to a **heliocentric model**, Hedera envisions a solar system where public and private networks coexist, interact, and scale together.



This vision is not just a technological evolution—it is a reimagining of how trust, data, and value can flow seamlessly across systems, industries, and geographies. Just as the Copernican Revolution reshaped humanity’s understanding of the cosmos, Hedera’s heliocentric approach is set to redefine the blockchain universe.



**From Geocentrism to Heliocentrism: Establishing the Decentralized “Trust Layer of the Internet”**



The analogy of **Geocentric vs. Heliocentric systems** offers a compelling framework for understanding how Hedera Hashgraph, private Hashspheres, and open-sourced Hiero can converge to establish a **decentralized “trust layer of the internet”** and position Hashgraph as the **trust anchor for the “internet of value.”**



In this vision, Hedera’s **public mainnet** serves as the unifying core (the “Sun”) of a decentralized ecosystem. **Private Hashspheres** (special-purpose subnets) operate as customizable orbital systems, while **Hiero** (Hedera’s open-source code base) ensures open innovation and interoperability. Together, they form an interconnected, secure, and scalable system, mirroring the transition from fragmented geocentric systems to an integrated heliocentric model.



**Hedera Public Mainnet: The Immutable Trust Anchor**



At the center of the ecosystem lies **Hedera’s public mainnet**, analogous to the **Sun** in the heliocentric model. It provides a **decentralized trust layer** upon which all other systems—public or private—can anchor.

1. **The Trust Layer for the Internet**:

• The mainnet establishes **global consensus, immutability, and transparency**, acting as a neutral, decentralized trust anchor for all digital interactions.

• It validates critical transactions, records proofs from private Hashspheres, and ensures that all participants in the system share a common source of truth.

2. **Secure and Scalable Core**:

• Hedera’s unique **Hashgraph consensus algorithm** ensures unparalleled speed, fairness, and energy efficiency, making it a scalable foundation for global adoption.

• Its **governance model**, led by a diverse council of world-leading organizations, ensures decentralization and resilience, creating trust across industries.



By acting as the Sun-like gravitational core, Hedera’s public mainnet ensures that the broader ecosystem remains unified and reliable, even as private subnets and open-source innovations orbit independently.



**Private Hashspheres: Customizable, Interoperable Subnets**



In this ecosystem, **Hashspheres** represent **private or permissioned sub-networks** that orbit the Hedera mainnet, similar to how planets revolve around the Sun. These subnets are tailored to meet specific privacy, compliance, or scalability requirements while remaining anchored to the public trust layer.

1. **Specialized Sub-Networks**:

• Enterprises and industries can deploy private Hashspheres to manage sensitive data, enforce custom rules, and operate with efficiency while still linking to the public mainnet for **trust anchoring**.

• For example, a Hashsphere could handle private healthcare data under HIPAA compliance while anchoring critical proofs or hashes on the Hedera mainnet for verifiability.

2. **Interoperability as a Feature**:

• Hashspheres are not isolated silos but interoperable sub-networks that can seamlessly exchange data and assets with the public mainnet or other subnets.

• This interoperability enables industries to break free from the fragmented “geocentric” model, creating a **connected ecosystem** where data and value can flow freely across networks.

3. **Scalability through Decentralized Design**:

• By offloading specific workloads to Hashspheres, the ecosystem achieves **scalability without compromising trust**. Critical transactions anchor to the public ledger, while high-volume, private operations occur in specialized subnets.



Hashspheres allow organizations to customize their solutions without losing the benefits of a decentralized ecosystem, creating a dynamic balance between autonomy and accountability.



**Open-Sourced Hiero: The Catalyst for Innovation**



To truly become the **“trust layer of the internet,”** the ecosystem requires a foundation of **open innovation and collaboration.** This is where **Hiero**, Hedera’s open-source code base governed by the Linux Foundation for Decentralized Trust, plays a vital role.

1. **Open Innovation for the Internet of Value**:

• Hiero provides developers with open-source tools, standards, and protocols to build on Hedera and Hashspheres, accelerating innovation while ensuring interoperability across the ecosystem.

• It empowers developers to create new applications and sub-networks that integrate seamlessly with Hedera’s public trust layer and private Hashspheres.

2. **Decentralized Collaboration**:

• By operating under the governance of the Linux Foundation, Hiero ensures that the ecosystem remains **community-driven** and resistant to centralized control.

• This fosters global participation, ensuring that Hedera and its ecosystem evolve to meet the diverse needs of enterprises, developers, and users.

3. **Driving Interoperability Standards**:

• Hiero establishes **open standards for data exchange, value transfer, and governance**, ensuring that all components of the system can interact seamlessly.

• This creates the foundation for a **universal decentralized architecture**, bridging not only networks within Hedera but also external blockchains and traditional systems.



**Hashgraph as the Trust Anchor for the Internet of Value**



The term **“internet of value”** refers to a global infrastructure that enables the seamless transfer of assets, data, and trust across networks. Hashgraph is uniquely suited to anchor this vision due to its performance, governance, and adaptability.

1. **Unparalleled Speed and Scalability**:

Hashgraph’s consensus algorithm enables the **real-time transfer of value and data** across billions of users and devices, making it an ideal trust anchor for a global economy.

2. **Fair and Secure Consensus**:

Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on energy-intensive proof-of-work or centralized proof-of-stake mechanisms, Hashgraph offers **asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (ABFT)**—ensuring fairness, resilience, and security at scale.

3. **A Foundation for Interconnected Systems**:

As the “Sun” of a heliocentric ecosystem, Hashgraph provides the unifying gravitational force that ensures **stability, accountability, and trust** across the internet of value. Whether through public, permissioned, or open-source components, Hashgraph anchors the ecosystem, ensuring all systems operate in harmony.



**Culmination: A Decentralized Cosmos for the Internet**



The geocentric model of siloed blockchains is an outdated paradigm, limiting the potential of distributed ledger technology to revolutionize the way trust and value flow across the internet. Hedera Hashgraph, through its **public mainnet, private Hashspheres, and open-source Hiero**, offers a heliocentric vision where interoperability, scalability, and innovation converge.



In this decentralized “solar system,” Hedera serves as the Sun—a constant and reliable trust layer anchoring the ecosystem. Hashspheres orbit as specialized sub-networks, enabling enterprises and industries to scale while maintaining privacy and autonomy. Hiero, as the open-source foundation, catalyzes innovation and ensures interoperability, creating a cohesive framework for global collaboration.



Together, these components form a unified, trust-driven architecture—a decentralized “trust layer of the internet” that positions Hashgraph as the ultimate **trust anchor for the internet of value.** Like the Copernican revolution, this vision redefines the blockchain universe, creating an interconnected, interoperable system capable of powering the next era of digital innovation."

Trying to go for a weekly chapter for this, but we'll see if this has legs.

\---

**Morning**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

Sheriff Reynard Mueller heaved a sigh, his gaze sweeping over the pearl-grain fields stretching out before him. The multitudes of stalks, heavy with ripe grain, appeared to shimmer in the sunlight as they swayed in the breeze. An idyllic pastoral scene common to Caedwyn Realm, the sort of sight that soothed Reynard's nerves in trying times, whether it was back in his days as a conscript in the Nexian legions, or dealing with the trials and tribulations of life on the frontier.

Reynard turned his gaze slightly to the right, the simple movement immediately souring his mood. Another plot of pearl-grain came into sight, but it was a far cry from the pristine view Reynard was admiring moments ago. A series of large and intricate patterns had been trampled into the field, as if it had been stamped by a giant branding iron from the heavens. The patterns were not confined to a single plot, but instead extended to several neighboring plots as well.

Worse still, the culprit behind the defaced fields had not been content to limit their mischief to the Burley farm. Similar patterns had been spotted out on the plains, grazing grounds, and even in the deep forest. As ever, the rumormongers were having a grand time speculating on the nature and intent of these mysterious markings. These myriad theories ranged from bored pranksters to foreign saboteurs. Even sinister beings from old folk tales were pointed to as the culprits. 

To add more kindling to the blaze, there had also been sightings of what folk were calling 'hexfire', strange and distant lights that danced in the sky with a speed and agility that did not match any creature or conveyance known to Caedwyn. Even worldly men like Reynard, who had served in the Nexian military in distant Realms, were at a loss to explain the bizarre occurrences. In the middle of this confusion, Reynard and the constabulary labored to carry out their duties. Looking to the mercifully clear skies, the Sheriff wondered if this was only the beginning of his troubles.

As if summoned by his dark mood, the angry thudding of hooves reached Reynard’s ears. That would be Eamon Burley, owner of this farm, no doubt ready to give him an earful about what an outrage this all was. Eamon was a gentleman who took it upon himself to voice his opinions at full volume, lest the world be deprived of his valuable insights. “Ah well, nice while it lasted,” muttered Reynard, bidding silent farewell to the lovely view, and turning to face Eamon.  
“Didn’t take half of forever to get here, did you, Mueller?” bellowed the irate farmer.  
“Good day to you too, Eamon,” greeted Reynard drily. “Steady on now, no sense in calling down the legions just yet.”  
“Hah! As if soldiers would be worth a damn for this mischief! There’s strange magic afoot!” said Eamon, gesturing to the defaced plot of pearl grain behind him.  
“Strange magic? How do you reckon that, Eamon?”  
Eamon leaned in and whispered conspiratorially to Reynard. “It’s dark business, I’m telling you. I’m no mage, but I did get a bit of the Sight from my blessed mother, and I didn’t feel one bloody bit of mana stirring during the whole commotion! How’s that possible, I ask you?”  
“That is a bit odd,” admitted Reynard. “Better off asking Dara about that sort of thing. She arrived ahead of me, didn’t she?”  
“Ah, Deputy Shelly, good egg that one, bright girl. Came up here with that wildman of yours in tow, she did.”

Reynard scowled at the epithet. While Meadowfolk and Woodfolk were branches of the same tree, they were often at odds with each other, given their differing ways of life. That estrangement had only deepened with the ongoing Nexian Reformations, which favored the Meadowfolk. The Nexians considered the Meadowfolk to be ‘more civilized’ than their ‘backward’ cousins, and some Meadowfolk had taken it to heart, branding the Woodfolk as ‘wildmen’.  
“Rabbit does honest work for the constabulary, Eamon. No need for that kind of talk.”  
“Pfah, what’s the lie in calling him a wildman, with his antlers looking like a tangle of brambles, and all that poppycock dangling from them?”  
“No lie at all, Farmer Burley,” Rabbit interjected suddenly, emerging from both men’s blind spots, as if appearing out of thin air.

To his credit, Reynard only flinched in surprise, while Eamon let out an undignified yelp. Rabbit stood before them, clad in his usual mottled leathers and woodsman’s gear. While Eamon’s description of Rabbit’s antlers was uncharitable, there was a kernel of truth to it. Woodfolk let their antlers grow free and untrimmed, favoring asymmetry, and decorated them with all manner of charms and talismans. The result was a vibrant mess that they proudly wore like crowns, a stark contrast to the well-trimmed and modestly decorated antlers of the Meadowfolk.

“Morning Sarge, Farmer,” greeted the smirking ranger. Most of the local Woodfolk had taken to calling Reynard ‘Sarge’ due to former military rank. Woodfolk were odd like that with names. By their reckoning, ‘Sarge’ was a name with real power behind it, a title earned by blood and deed. Not quite up to Nexian standards of professionalism, but things were a bit more relaxed out in the frontier realms.  
“Morning, Rabbit. Starting the day with a bit of stalking practice?” Reynard replied, pretending to not have been taken by surprise.  
""Oh, I weren't even trying. Easy work, coming up quiet on someone when their mind’s looking elsewhere,"" drawled Rabbit. ""But that’s not the story you want, so I’ll tell you the other. I was up on the roof, getting light prints of the mess in the fields. Dara’s out there having a closer look. Also spotted a bit of sheep track heading out to the grasslands.”  
“Oh! Right, I damn near forgot, I–”  
“Should come along so we can find those poor blighters and get them safely home. Fair plan, right?” Eamon could only mumble in agreement as Rabbit led him off to track down his lost sheep. Reynard tipped an imaginary cap to Rabbit in thanks. 

**Greater United Nations Long Range Expeditionary Force**  
**Survey Station Selene, Observation Deck**

Senior Technician Cristian Mendez heaved a sigh, taking in the stunning view from the observation deck. A vast starfield stretched out before him, a dazzling array of celestial jewels glittering against the cold void of space. The station was located on the dark side of Caedwyn’s moon, meaning planet-rise wasn’t visible to them, but Mendez preferred starfields anyway. “Sure is pretty out there. Damn shame it’s a damn death trap,” he thought aloud. Someone chuckled behind him. “Kinda like deep sea facilities, y’know? Surrounded by wonder and mystery that’ll kill you dead if you stepped out into it,” they commented.

Mendez turned to see Drone Operations Specialist Joseph Anders, his coworker and long-time friend. “More or less, yeah. At least we get bigger windows,” he replied, waving to Anders.  
“Flying drones are cooler than submersibles too, if you ask me,” said Anders, handing Mendez a cup of coffee.  
“Speaking of, wanna head to the Ops Center? Next flight is in 30, with a new rotation. Might be better to get there early to make sure the prep’s done right,” suggested Mendez, tilting his head in the direction of the Remote Drone Operations Center.  
“Damn, that’s right, double rotations after the brass went on the warpath. Let’s hop to it, then.” 

The pair set off to their workplace, sipping their drinks while continuing their conversation. “How’d that debrief go, by the way?” asked Anders. Earlier in the day, Mendez had gone through a marathon of a debriefing with the higher-ups, covering the system-wide glitch that caused all the commotion planetside. It was a dubious reward for not only being the ‘first responder’ to the whole mess, but also managing the ensuing damage control and cleanup operations.  
“You know how it goes, good work gets rewarded with more work,” answered Mendez, which got a nod of understanding from Anders. He continued, “On the plus side, they were all ears when I outlined the cleanup and retrieval plans, and they seem to be on board with playing things safer now.”  
“I’ll say they’re on board,” agreed Anders, grinning. “Word is that the computer janitors who screwed up are getting extra special attention from an oversight committee. Plus, total rollback of automated systems, manual operation with max supervision for all missions going forward.”  
Mendez nodded, his expression hardening. “About damn time. We’ve been over-reliant on the locals’ ignorance of Earth tech to stay invisible. These folks aren’t stupid. Give ‘em enough clues, and they’re gonna figure out what to look for, and where. Throw all that magic bullshit into the mix and we’re a coin flip away from our work becoming damn near impossible. High time we got back to playing it safe and using our damn heads.”  
“Look at you, all responsible and shit. Relax, all the code monkeys and their shiny toys got sent packing. We’re calling the shots until the dust settles,” reasoned Anders, which got a shrug from Mendez.  
“Yeah, I suppose that’s something. After we put out these fires, we can start pushing for some sane best practices. Speaking of cleanup though, I’ve got some plans that I need to go over with you.”  
Anders raised an eyebrow. “That sounds like more work, Cris. I already got an entire wing of drone jocks to babysit.”  
“Yeah, but this is about scooping up all the physical evidence and covering our tracks, including the stuff the locals might have in lockup. Just a big ol’ heist movie, figured you might be interested, buddy.”  
“Well shit, you know just how to bait that hook, dontcha? All right boss, lemme hear this cleanup plan of yours…”

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

With Rabbit keeping Eamon occupied, Reynard was free to seek out his deputy, Dara Shelly. If anyone would be able to make head or tail of this bedlam, it would be her. Dara’s meticulous nature and arcane expertise made her well suited for the task. Her mana aptitude pushed the boundaries of the gifted commoners, but sadly fell short of the admissions requirements of the regional Academy of Magical Arts. It was the Academy's loss, by Reynard's reckoning. Dara had a keen mind in addition to her arcane talents, and had proven time and again to be a valuable member of the constabulary. If those gilded robes at the Academy failed to see her worth, they could go boil their heads for all he cared.

Looking around, Reynard spotted a woman with short-cropped red hair and severely trimmed antlers walking about the fields, taking notes and collecting samples. ""Hoi, Dara! Find anything?"" he called out as he approached her.  
""Nothing of note. Well, compared to all of this,"" She was standing in a perfect circle of trampled stalks, one of many that scarred Burley's fields. Beyond the circles were also concentric  rings, equally precise, as well as myriad geometric shapes, all connected by lines of varying width. Dara made a sweeping gesture, explaining, ""Same as all the other reports, a series of intricate patterns, joined by these straight lines in an irregular loop.""  
""Hm, looks like they were going in circles when they trampled the grain,” said Reynard, looking at the way the flattened pearl-grain lay on the ground. “Some kind of ritual, then?"" he asked.  
Dara shook her head in response. ""No, ritual magic requires consistent invocation patterns, but these are too haphazard. It’s all a jumble of circles, rings, and lines. If it’s following a pattern, it’s not an arcane one.""  
""Well, Nexian magic needs regular patterns anyway,"" Reynard mused. ""But it doesn't look like Druidic magic either. Druid runework is all... wibbly-wobbly, right?"" Reynard wiggled his fingers for emphasis, earning a scowl from Dara.  
""All wibbly-wobbly? Honestly Sheriff, would it kill you to use proper terminology?"" she grumbled. ""Technically you're right, though. This isn't anything like the vine and bough patterns of Woodfolk ritual magic,"" she continued. ""It's exceedingly strange. All of the individual parts of the pattern are remarkably precise. But when taken as a whole, they're complete nonsense,"" muttered Dara to herself.  
""Well there you go, we'll put a warrant out for an insane geometer with improbably large tools,"" joked Reynard.  
“Academicians run amok, may His Eternal Majesty deliver us,” deadpanned Dara in response. They shared a chuckle as Dara continued taking measurements and samples.

Reynard took a closer look at the trampled stalks while speaking to Dara. On its own, it was simple enough to figure out. Something heavy had come along and crushed the stalks flat. A group of strong youths with a wooden beam and a length of rope could have done the job, probably. No, what made this such a mystery was how swiftly the culprits had managed to do their work so swiftly in so many places, seemingly all at the same time. There was also the matter of the witnesses swearing up and down that they neither saw nor felt any spellwork being woven during the incidents. “It is a bit odd though, that nobody with the Sight felt any magic during all this commotion,” mused Reynard.   
Dara huffed. “Don’t get me started on the nonsense that’s been going around,” she growled. “Can you imagine? Something of the size they described going airborne without the aid of magic?” Dara shot to her feet and jabbed a finger skyward. “Not just airborne, mind you, but so high up the ‘hexfire’ blinked out, like it shot past the bloody Tapestry!”  
Reynard stifled a laugh, and ventured, “So you’re saying it’s not too likely this was something mundane?”

He swore she’d start shooting plumes of fire from her eyes, from the look she was giving him. As the constabulary’s most mana-gifted member, Dara did tend to get into a lather about the particulars of the magical arts. This hexfire business in particular was doing her head in, what with damn near everything about the incidents defying common sense. Dara took a deep breath, looking like she was about to let loose with a rant, but then thought better of it and slowly exhaled instead.   
“Right then, I’m not saying the witnesses are lying, or that they’re necessarily wrong,” she began, reining in her frustration. “The issue is that it’s irresponsible to fall back on fantastical notions like manaless artifices, as if mundane forces could somehow rival the power of mana. Just because you don’t see the mana fields moving, doesn’t mean you can just throw out the fundamental order of the world,” she explained.  
Reynard nodded. “It’s as you often say, nothing happens in contradiction to the natural order,” he began.  
“They are merely in contradiction to what we currently know of the natural order, exactly,” she finished, smiling. “Sounds like you’ve been paying attention to my ‘unofficial lectures’ at least,” she added with a laugh.  
“Contrary to popular belief, I can be taught,” quipped Reynard with a wry grin. “But getting back to the issue. If there is magic at play, but nobody sensed it, what’s the more reasonable explanation? Some kind of concealment?”  
“Concealment is one option we can look into. You see, according to current literature…”

""Hey Mendez, check it out, it's Sheriff Rey-Rey and my homegirl Dara!"" said Anders excitedly, pointing to an infil-drone video feed of the Sheriff and his deputy. As persons of interest in the ongoing cleanup operations, the constabulary were under regular surveillance most of the time, and as such enjoyed minor celebrity status among the drone operators.  
""Christ, Anders. They're not a bunch of hypernet streamers, can the parasocial crap,"" replied Mendez.  
""Look, I'm a simple man. I see a redhead, I subscribe.""  
""Like you’ve got a shot, fanboy. Anything new with the law?""  
""Still the usual bagging and tagging of evidence, and interviewing witnesses. Basic police work, by the book stuff. Sheriff Rey, Dara, and Rabbit are scoping out the Burley farm, and we’ve got Baldie and Socks checking out a livestock mutilation out on the plains.”  
“Hm. And the Sheriff already swung by Splitskull?”  
“Yep, though he only dealt with Gladys’ goons, not the Hag herself. Her Ladyship was busy with other matters, apparently, and there was no sign of her outside,” explained Anders.  
“Shit, that can’t be good. The geological survey drone came back with a couple worms missing, didn’t it?” asked Mendez, referring to the burrowing sample collector robots that the survey drones deployed to take core samples over a given area.  
“Unfortunately, yeah. How much you wanna bet ol’ Gladys got her claws on one of ‘em?”  
“One of ‘em? That old bitch has got her half of the mountain sewn up tighter than a Vac-U-Seal bag. She’s gotta have snagged both, no question.”  
“All right, what kind of money you got on the failsafes actually working?”  
“So what if they did? The electronics and servos would be slagged, but that still leaves them with a bunch of goodies to play with. Space-age alloys, precision machined parts, hell, the cutting heads on those things alone would probably make ‘em shit a brick.”  
“Welp, better start brainstorming on what we’re gonna do for Operation Claim Jumper…”

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia**

A few minutes' ride from the Burley farm, Constables Daruth Val’Ged and Elwin Redfoot, better known as Baldie and Socks, were performing their duties in the wake of the hexfire’s rampage. They were currently investigating another incident site, similar to the others but with an alarmingly grisly difference: an eviscerated sheep lay splayed out in the middle of the strange pattern pressed into the plains grass. Socks was currently investigating the carcass. He was no stranger to gore, being a huntsman, but the display still managed to unnerve him with how bizarre it was. 

While he wasn’t the best student of magic, nothing he saw here resembled any of the rituals from the elders’ teachings. It didn’t even look like outlander magic, like what the Nexians used. The body itself harbored more mysteries. Scavengers had gnawed and mangled it some, shifting some parts from where they once sat, but a proper look revealed more. Scorch and puncture marks no wider than a knitting needle dotted the body, whether by chance or intent, he couldn’t say. The body had been cut open long before the vermin had gotten to it, surely with a magical blade. That was the only tool that could have left such clean and neat edges on flesh and bone alike. 

As for the innards, it looked like the culprit took their pick of the organs, snatching up the heart, liver, left kidney, and a good arm’s length of guts. The stomachs were cast to the side, each one punctured and emptied for gods only knew what reason. Socks couldn’t tell if this phantom butcher was a master or a madman. Whatever the culprit’s nature, Dara would definitely want to take a closer look at this. Weighing his options, he elected to bag up the carcass as evidence, seeing as carrion eaters had already run roughshod all over the scene. He silently cursed himself for not asking for the wagon.

Behind him, Baldie was interviewing Old Hob, the shepherd who had apparently witnessed the incident, but Baldie had serious doubts about that. He was trying his best to not let the cranky old cuss embarrass himself, but he was having quite the time of it. “All right Hob, let’s see if I’ve got this right,” began Baldie, his brow furrowed in consternation. Hob glared back at him. “You were out late at night, rounding up some strays that got loose, when suddenly some… thing–”  
""It were them witch-lights, a whole swarm of ‘em! I told you thrice already!”  
“Right, so down they come, shining light in your eyes. After blinding you, they snatch up the strays and leave you out on the plains.”  
“Aye, I sent up a signal too, but you lawmen showed up all slow like!”  
“We were busy, Hob. You weren’t the only one with… troubles last night,” countered Baldie. “In any case, by the time the night watch arrived, the strays had come back to you. So what’s all the fuss about, then?”  
“They’re marked by the hexfire, they are! A dark pall hangs o’er them!”  
“And that’s why you decided to shear them down to the bare hide?”  
“Well, how else was I s’posed to reveal the dark marks?”

Baldie glanced over at the shorn sheep. If they were in the thrall of some otherworldly force, they weren’t showing it. They were currently grazing on a patch of clover, blissfully unaware of the drama unfolding around them, making Baldie feel a pang of envy. Socks approached to join them, having completed the bloody business of packing up the evidence. He spoke to Hob while wiping his hands off on a rag.   
“Keep your velvet on, Hob. How about this, we’ll bring ‘em to the chattel physick to take a look-see. If he gives the all clear, you have to take ‘em back, and if something’s amiss, we’ll square away the price with you. All right?”  
“Whatever suits you, just get ‘em away from me. I don’t feel safe, knowing they’re watching me for their dark master. Who knows what they’re plotting?” hissed the old man, shaking his fist at the sheep. Baldie and Socks looked at the still oblivious animals, grazing away without a care in the world, then back to Hob. They were clearly unimpressed.

“They’re unclean, I tell you! Unclean!” insisted Hob, jabbing his finger at one of the supposed agents of the dark powers.

As if on cue, the sheep farted. Baldie and Socks remained unimpressed.

**Greater United Nations Long Range Expeditionary Force**   
**Survey Station Selene, Remote Drone Operations Center**

“Goddammit,” said Mendez with a tired sigh, watching Baldie and Socks on the screen as they led away their newly acquired sheep. “So we got three tracker-tagged sheep literally getting booked by the cops. What the hell is a ‘chattel physick’? Some kind of country vet or something?”  
“Yeah, a vet for farm animals, if I remember right. We’ve probably got a file on the guy and where his place is at. I’ll include it in the mission prep materials. Are we running a mission to get ‘em back?”  
“Depends. What did the drone stick ‘em with? Standard tracker, or a full on sensor package?”  
Tapping on his keyboard, Anders scanned his screen for the information. “Looks like they got the fauna biometrics tracking suite,” he said, wincing. He rattled off the specs, “Six low profile capsules, four subdermal, two intramuscular.”  
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” lamented Mendez, cradling his head in his hands. “The hell kind of retrieval mission do we fly for something like this?”  
“Aren’t you the one who said it’d be like a big ol’ heist movie? Think of it as a challenge! I can see it now, The Great Mutton Caper!”  
“*No manches* Mutton Caper! I oughta make mutton outta you, *cabron*,” grumbled Mendez.  
“Aw c’mon, look on the bright side, we’ll know exactly where they are at any given time, thanks to the trackers. That’s more than we can say for those missing driller bots,” replied Anders with a grin. 

Mendez remained unamused.

**Late Evening**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Miller’s Hollow, Municipal Guardhouse**

Reynard looked up from his ledger, glancing around the guardhouse offices. Flanking him were Baldie and Sam, busy with a stack of reports each. The three of them were handling paperwork, compiling witness testimonies for filing later. Dara and Socks were examining the animal remains and other perishable items. Rabbit and Belkund were in the evidence locker, tagging and sorting the rest of the items. They had burned every minute of daylight gathering everything they could in the wake of the hexfire sightings, and that was only half the job done. Now they had to attend to teasing apart the tangled account of events, and knit it back into a coherent and orderly telling. That’s what the Administratum would demand, and Reynard fully understood the risks of defying this expectation. 

The Nexian officials staffing the Administratum would be especially displeased with how the strange events seemed to be reviving old superstitions. Phrases like 'hexfire' were remnants of the past, rooted in the old magics of the realm, before the Nexians papered over the 'backward superstitions of ignorant rustics' with more civilized magical arts. The Nexians were accustomed to a newrealm’s old ways retreating to the margins of history, while the Nexus busily penned new chapters with grand, sweeping strokes.

Such gusto often placed a great deal of pressure on the local populace and their leaders. So far, the Nexians were content to push their Reformations at a gradual but steady pace. But Reynard knew their patience would not last forever. Soon enough, they would become much more insistent and far less polite. His time in the military taught him just how insistent and impolite the Empire could be. Not wanting to dwell further on such thoughts, Reynard busied himself with his paperwork once more.

He had a long shift ahead of him."

Payroll Tool for Independent Contractors?,Payroll,1i9p7y6,2025-01-25 10:23:52,0,0.5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/1i9p7y6/payroll_tool_for_independent_contractors/,cosmos15,,"I am starting a business of independent contractors that I contract to provide services to customers.  Which service would be best for this?  I have heard about Gusto but some of the reviews I have seen about it do not seem good.  I have read about a few instances where payroll is rejected and payments are several days late.  I looked into Square but am concerned since payroll is not their primary business service.  I have also looked into RUN powered by ADP but it seems like it may be overkill for what I want to do.  I know I could keep a ledger and write checks every week but a big benefit for me is the capability to pay people from my computer or phone.

I would like to be able to do these things:

* Reliably Pay independent contractors without delays
* Handle 1099 taxes for independent contractors
* Onboard independent contractors and gather info needed to pay them
* Manage independent contractor work agreements
* Background checks would be nice too
* Ability to run payroll from computer or phone"

The Halls of Helios

Harmony’s capital city, Helios, was a mosaic of ambition and adaptability. Its streets were a fusion of Earth’s architectural traditions and Harmony’s untamed landscapes, a testament to the fragile but determined colony. In her chambers within the Governor’s Hall, Estrella Montalvo y Estrella held a copy of Sebastián’s latest proclamation regarding Puerto Rico’s expanding financial influence.

The document was clean, precise, and unyielding—everything her brother’s governance embodied. It outlined the establishment of charters for Puerto Rican currency in regions ranging from Europe to Mars. Her advisors had delivered it with an air of trepidation, knowing how it might stir her.

Estrella’s eyes scanned the parchment, her expression unreadable as she absorbed the news.

Estrella (to herself):
“So, Sebastián, you’ve found a way to tie the world together with your golden thread. A currency born of your ambition, woven into every market you can touch. Clever.”

She set the document down and looked out the window, her gaze drifting to the crimson horizon of Harmony. Her mind raced, not with jealousy or resentment, but with something more profound—a spark of imagination.

---

A Council Divided

Later that day, Estrella convened her council. The room was a cacophony of voices as factions debated Harmony’s path forward.

Elias Varga (frustrated):
“This proclamation is a direct challenge to Harmony’s independence. Sebastián seeks to anchor us to his empire by dominating trade and commerce. If we allow Puerto Rico’s currency to infiltrate our markets, we’ll lose what little autonomy we’ve fought to build.”

A younger councilor, Aria Tanaka, spoke up.

Aria:
“Or we could see it as an opportunity. Puerto Rico’s influence is undeniable, but it’s also stable. Aligning ourselves with their financial systems could bring security and resources we desperately need.”

The room buzzed with dissenting opinions until Estrella raised her hand, silencing the debate.

Estrella:
“Sebastián’s ambition is not new to us. What’s remarkable is the scope of his vision—connecting continents and planets through a single currency. It’s a tool of power, yes, but also a tool of unity.”

Varga crossed his arms, skeptical.

Varga:
“Unity under whose terms? Yours? His?”

Estrella met his gaze with a measured smile.

Estrella:
“Neither. If Sebastián can create a currency that reaches from Mars to Earth, why can’t we? Harmony is not Puerto Rico’s shadow—it’s its own light. We can build something better, something that reflects our values and ensures our future.”

The council murmured, some intrigued, others doubtful. Estrella’s tone sharpened.

Estrella:
“Puerto Rico’s strength lies in its unity, but Harmony’s strength lies in its diversity. We don’t need to mimic Sebastián’s empire. We need to harness what makes us unique. A coalition of equals, bound not by control but by mutual prosperity.”

---

The Spark of Imagination

That evening, Estrella retreated to her study. She pulled out a blank ledger, her pen hovering over the first page. The idea of creating a Harmonian currency consumed her thoughts—not as a direct rival to Puerto Rico’s system, but as a complement to it.

She scribbled notes furiously, imagining a decentralized financial network where each faction on Harmony maintained its autonomy while contributing to a collective system.

Estrella (to herself):
“A currency not backed by kings or crowns, but by the people. A system where trust is earned, not demanded. Harmony doesn’t need Sebastián’s golden thread—it needs a mosaic, every piece distinct but essential.”

The thought exhilarated her. For the first time in months, Estrella felt a clarity of purpose. Her brother’s actions had lit a fire in her, not of rebellion but of creation.

---

A Letter to Sebastián

The next morning, Estrella wrote a letter to her brother, her tone measured but firm.

Estrella’s Letter:     
*Sebastián,*     
*Your charters are impressive, as always. You’ve managed to do what few others could—tie disparate regions together through sheer will and ingenuity. But let me ask you this: what happens when the thread frays? When those regions pull away, each demanding their own share of the cloth?*

*Harmony will not be another strand in your tapestry. We are not your subjects, nor do we wish to be your adversaries. Instead, let us be your partners—equals in the great web you’re spinning. I’ve begun drafting plans for a Harmonian financial system, one that complements yours rather than competes. It will be decentralized, flexible, and above all, reflective of our values.*

*I expect your skepticism, but I also expect your respect. You’ve always underestimated me, Sebastián. I look forward to proving you wrong once again.*

*With resolve,*     
*Estrella*     

---

Sebastián’s Reaction

When Antonia Reyes delivered the letter to Sebastián, once again he weighed Estrella’s letter. Then, he read it carefully, his expression unreadable. Once finished, he set it down, then leaned back in his chair, his gaze drifting to the holographic map of Harmony.

Sebastián (murmuring):
“She doesn’t just push back; she builds. Good. Let her. The stronger she becomes, the more valuable Harmony is—to both of us.”

Antonia raised an eyebrow, curious.

Antonia:
“You’re not concerned about her creating a rival system?”

Sebastián shook his head, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Sebastián:
“A rival? No. A partner? Perhaps. Harmony will always be a part of Puerto Rico, even if it doesn’t realize it. Estrella’s ambition only strengthens my hand.”

He folded the letter and placed it in a drawer.

Sebastián:
“Let’s see what kind of mosaic she creates.”

The Ultimate Guide to Staking: Earn Passive Income with Crypto,DeFiYieldClub,1i9l35j,2025-01-25 06:32:43,5,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9l35j/the_ultimate_guide_to_staking_earn_passive_income/,Solanafluent,,"# 1. Introduction to Staking

# What is Staking?

Staking is a way to earn rewards on your crypto by locking it up to help secure a blockchain network. Instead of just holding your tokens, staking lets you put them to work and earn passive income. It’s like earning interest in a savings account, but for crypto.

# Proof of Stake (PoS) vs. Proof of Work (PoW)

* **PoW (Proof of Work)**: Used by Bitcoin, miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This requires a lot of computing power and energy.
* **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Instead of miners, validators are chosen based on how much crypto they stake. This method is more energy-efficient and allows for faster transactions.

# 2. Benefits of Staking

# Earn Passive Income

By staking, you receive rewards in the form of more crypto. For example, if you stake 100 SOL with a 8% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), you will earn 8 SOL over a year.

# Support Network Security

Stakers help validate transactions and prevent attacks. The more users staking, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes.

# Eco-Friendly Alternative to Mining

Unlike PoW mining, staking does not require large amounts of energy, making it a more sustainable way to support blockchain networks.

# 3. Types of Staking

# Direct Staking

* You lock up your assets directly on a blockchain.
* Requires technical knowledge.
* You are responsible for managing your stake.

# Delegated Staking

* You delegate your tokens to a trusted validator who stakes them for you.
* Easier for beginners.
* Validators take a small commission from your rewards.

# Liquid Staking

* You stake your assets but receive a liquid staking token (LST) like vSOL, mSOL, or JitoSOL, which can be used in DeFi.
* Allows you to stay liquid and use your staked funds for lending, farming, or other yield strategies.
* Higher rewards potential but involves smart contract risks.

# 4. How to Get Started with Staking

# Choosing the Right Crypto for Staking

* Popular staking tokens include **SOL (Solana), ETH (Ethereum), ADA (Cardano), and DOT (Polkadot).**
* Consider factors like staking yield, lock-up periods, and project credibility.

# Selecting a Wallet and Platform

* Use secure wallets like **Phantom, Ledger, or Solflare**.
* Choose a staking platform that offers transparency and security, such as **Marinade, Lido, Jito, or The Vault**.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Staking

1. **Choose a Wallet**: Set up a non-custodial wallet (etc Phantom for Solana or MetaMask for Ethereum).
2. **Select a Staking Provider**: Decide whether to stake directly with the network or through a third-party staking service.
3. **Stake Your Tokens**: Follow the platforms instructions to delegate your tokens.
4. **Track Your Rewards**: Use blockchain explorers or staking dashboards to track earnings.

# 5. Risks and Considerations

**Slashing Risks**

Some blockchains will put penalties if validators act corrupt or fail to validate transactions properly. Choosing a strong validator minimizes this risk.

# Lock-Up Periods

* Some networks require a **cooldown period** before you can unstake your tokens. Avoid CEX ( central exchanges at all costs) Coinbase even take a 35% cut from your rewards. That's insane.
* Liquid staking removes this issue but carries its own risks.

# Market Volatility

* Crypto prices goes up or down, so while you earn staking rewards, your staked assets value may decrease.
* Diversifying assets and strategies can help mitigate losses.

# 6. Advanced Staking Strategies

# Yield Farming with Liquid Staking

* Liquid staking tokens (vSOL, mSOL) can be used in **liquidity pools, lending platforms, or farming strategies** to earn extra rewards on top of staking yields. ( even more crypto)

# Restaking for Extra Rewards

* Some protocols allow **restaking**, where you use your liquid staking rewards to earn even more yield in different DeFi platforms.

# Diversification Strategy

* Split your stake across different validators to reduce risk and increase chances of better APY returns.

# Successful Staking Projects

* **Lido (ETH Staking)**: One of the largest staking platforms with liquid staking.
* **Marinade (SOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking.
* **The Vault (vSOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking focusing on community.

# 8. Future of Staking

# Emerging Trends

* **Increased Institutional Adoption**: More funds and enterprises staking crypto for yield.
* **Enhanced DeFi Integrations**: Liquid staking becoming central to yield strategies.

# Regulatory Considerations

* Some countries are **taxing staking rewards as income**, while others see them as capital gains.
* Decentralized staking may face **future regulatory review,** staying informed is key.

# Final Thoughts

Staking is one of the best ways to earn passive income in crypto while supporting network security. Whether you go for **direct staking, delegated staking, or liquid staking**, each method has its pros and cons. The key is to choose a strategy that fits your risk tolerance and investment goals.

"Trump Expansionism & Discrimination, the Dollar Economy, and the True Digital Gold",economicCollapse,1i92y3d,2025-01-24 13:55:45,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1i92y3d/trump_expansionism_discrimination_the_dollar/,saporrai,,"I’m bringing you an informative discussion about some interconnected topics: the expansionist view and discriminatory policies of Trump, the hegemony of the dollar, and finally, what really matters in the world of cryptocurrencies. Buckle up, because there’s a lot to unpack!

Let’s start with Trump because he’s a figure who never stops generating controversy. The guy has suggested **annexing Canada**, buying **Greenland** (yes, he wanted to buy a country!), and even retaking control of the **Panama Canal**. It sounds like a joke, but it’s not.

* **Canada**: Trump has said that Canada should become the ""51st state"" of the U.S., arguing that Americans spend too much protecting Canadians. Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, obviously rejected the idea, but it shows how Trump has an outdated view of territorial domination, reminiscent of the 19th century when the U.S. annexed Texas, California, and Hawaii.
* **Greenland**: Here’s where it gets interesting. Trump’s obsession with Greenland isn’t new, but his recent comments have reignited the debate. In 2024, during a rally, Trump doubled down on his desire to acquire Greenland, calling it a ""strategic and economic goldmine."" He said, \*""Greenland is a massive piece of land, and it’s right there for us. It’s got all these minerals, all these resources. We could do so much with it. And Denmark? They don’t even care about it. They’re just sitting on it.""\*This isn’t the first time he’s made such remarks. Back in 2019, he even suggested that the U.S. could simply ""take it"" if Denmark refused to sell. The Danish government and Greenland’s leaders have repeatedly rejected these ideas, with Greenland’s Foreign Minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, stating, \*""Greenland is not for sale. Our future is not a commodity.""\*Trump’s fixation on Greenland highlights his transactional view of international relations, where countries and territories are seen as assets to be acquired rather than sovereign entities with their own rights and aspirations.
* **Panama Canal**: Trump suggested that the U.S. should retake control of the canal, claiming that American ships are being ""overcharged."" However, the canal was returned to Panama in 1999, and the Panamanian president made it clear: ""every square meter of the canal belongs to Panama.""

These expansionist ideas show how Trump still thinks in terms of domination and control, something the modern world has moved past (or at least should have).

# Trump’s Discriminatory Policies

Trump’s statements and policies that have been widely criticized as discriminatory, especially against Latinos and immigrants.

* **Mexicans**: Right at the start of his 2016 campaign, Trump generalized Mexican immigrants as ""criminals, rapists, and drug dealers."" This not only reinforced harmful stereotypes but also fueled xenophobia in the U.S.
* **Puerto Rico**: In 2024, a Trump ally called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage."" Trump, in turn, promised mass deportations and described the U.S. as an ""occupied country."" This sparked outrage in the Puerto Rican community and among Latino rights advocates.
* **African Countries and Haiti**: In 2018, Trump referred to African countries and Haiti as ""shithole countries,"" suggesting that the U.S. should take more immigrants from Norway. These remarks were widely condemned as racist and disrespectful.

These policies and statements not only damaged the U.S.’s global image but also increased discrimination and violence against Latino and immigrant communities.

# The Dollar’s Hegemony and How It Harms the World

The U.S. dollar is one of the greatest forces (and problems) in the modern world.

* **Global Domination**: The dollar has been the world’s reserve currency since 1944, used in over 80% of global transactions. This gives the U.S. an ""exorbitant privilege"": they can print money to cover their debts without immediate consequences.
* **Uncontrolled Printing**: During the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve printed trillions of dollars to save the U.S. economy. This led to global inflation, hurting countries that rely on the dollar for imports and trade.
* **Global Dependence**: Countries like Sri Lanka and Lebanon depend on the dollar, even as their local currencies collapse. This creates massive vulnerability, as any instability in the dollar directly impacts these economies.

The dollar is, essentially, a ""piece of crap"" for the world because the U.S. abuses its monetary power, creating global crises while maintaining control over the international economy.

# Bitcoin: Traceable and Controllable

Now, let’s talk about cryptocurrencies because this is where things get even more interesting. Bitcoin, which many see as a decentralized and liberating currency, actually has a big problem: **it’s traceable.** *and that's the reason for Trump supporting this currency; otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense to support a currency, that in theory, goes against everything the dollar stands for. A currency that his government wouldn't be able to control who uses it or how much is used.*

* **Transparent Blockchain**: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, the blockchain. This means that, with the right tools, governments can track financial movements and identify wallets.
* **Pseudonymity, Not Anonymity**: While transactions aren’t directly linked to real identities, the use of centralized exchanges and KYC (Know Your Customer) processes allows governments to connect wallet addresses to personal data.
* **Future of Taxation**: In a scenario where fiat currencies start to collapse, governments can use Bitcoin’s traceability to identify and tax citizens. This is already happening in several countries, including Brazil, where crypto gains are taxed at up to 22.5%.

Bitcoin, therefore, isn’t as liberating as it seems. It can be a tool of control in the hands of governments.

# The True Digital Gold

If you want a cryptocurrency that truly challenges the system and protects your privacy, **Monero** is the answer.

* **Real Privacy**: Unlike Bitcoin, Monero is completely anonymous. It uses technologies like ring signatures and stealth addresses to ensure transactions can’t be traced.
* **Censorship-Resistant**: Monero is decentralized and resistant to government interference. This makes it a direct threat to the financial control governments exert over populations.
* **Unlikely Government Support**: Precisely because it’s anonymous and decentralized, it’s very unlikely that any government will support Monero. It represents true financial freedom, something governments aren’t willing to give up.

While Bitcoin can be co-opted by the system, Monero is the true ""digital gold"" for those who value privacy and freedom.

# Conclusion

So, folks, what do we have here? A scenario where the U.S. continues to exert political and economic domination, the dollar is a tool of global control, and even Bitcoin, which many see as a solution, can be used against us in the future.

The problem is, as long as governments and traditional financial institutions are in power, they’ll do everything to maintain control.

**TL;DR**: Trump has an outdated expansionist vision, the dollar is a tool of global control, Bitcoin is traceable and can be used by governments, but Monero is the true digital gold because it’s anonymous and decentralized. Governments will never support Monero because they’d lose control over the population."

### **Chapter XII: A Kingdom's Weight**     
     
The great hall of Casa Montalvo was quiet, save for the soft rustle of pages and the occasional clink of a pen against the desk. Sebastián sat at the head of the long oak table, his gaze fixed on the intricate map of Puerto Rico and its expanding territories projected before him.

The room carried the air of transition—documents and ledgers stacked neatly, correspondence awaiting signatures, and a single sealed envelope marked with the crest of the Royal Intelligence Service resting at his side. This was no ordinary briefing; this was the weight of a kingdom consolidated into paper and ink.


---

A Vision in Conflict

Director Elena Morales entered quietly, a tablet in hand. She wore her usual uniform, but there was a stiffness in her posture, a hesitation that Sebastián rarely saw in her.

Elena:
“You asked to see me, Governor.”

Sebastián gestured for her to take a seat, his tone measured but firm. “The report on Soria’s activities. What’s the latest?”

Elena handed him the tablet, her voice steady despite the gravity of her words.

Elena:
“She’s consolidating her forces around Ceres. We’ve intercepted communications indicating she’s leveraging support from the North American Trade Federation. They’re supplying her with logistics and covert funding, enough to destabilize the Freeholds if she moves fast.”

Sebastián studied the report, his brow furrowing. “And our response?”

Elena:
“We’ve tightened the financial net. The Montalvo family’s banking network is holding firm, but she’s found back channels. The Federation’s reach is longer than we anticipated.”

He sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Soria was always a survivor. She’s betting on us making a mistake.”


---

The Failsafe Revealed

Sebastián set the tablet down, his gaze distant for a moment. “There’s something I’ve been working on, Elena. A contingency plan.”

Elena raised an eyebrow. “Contingency for what?”

He tapped a small button on the desk, and a holographic document appeared in the air—a legal draft, intricate and precise.

Sebastián:
“This is a failsafe clause. If something were to happen to me, the monarchy dissolves. The duchies, the counties, everything reverts back to municipalities and democratic governance.”

Elena’s eyes widened, her voice sharp. “You’re planning to dismantle everything you’ve built?”

Sebastián:
“Not planning. Preparing. This system works because I’m here to balance it. But if I fall, the Crown becomes a liability. Better to let it end cleanly than risk it being used against the people.”

Elena shook her head, disbelief mingling with frustration. “You’re gambling the future of an entire kingdom on the assumption that democracy will save it? After all we’ve fought for?”

Sebastián:
“No, I’m gambling on the people. They deserve the chance to decide their own fate, whether they rise or fall. This isn’t about me—it’s about them.”


---

A Kingdom in Motion

Before Elena could respond, the door opened, and Martín Montalvo stepped in, his expression grim.

Martín:
“The council has approved the consolidation of the Bayamón district. The duchy is official.”

Sebastián stood, adjusting his jacket. “Good. Have the documents prepared for the new Duke. And ensure the people understand what this means for them—new infrastructure, better services, real progress.”

Martín hesitated, then added, “There’s one more thing. We’ve received word from the Freehold Territories. Governor de Silva is en route back to Puerto Rico. His son, Luis, has formally accepted the title of Duke.”

Sebastián nodded, his mind already moving to the next steps. “Luis will do well. But keep an eye on him. A new Duke with ambition can be as dangerous as an old enemy.”


---

The Call of the Crown

Later that evening, Sebastián stood on the balcony overlooking the city. The lights of San Juan stretched out before him, a testament to everything he had worked to build. Yet the weight of the failsafe clause lingered in his mind.

Elena joined him, her earlier frustration replaced with quiet understanding.

Elena:
“You’re not wrong, Sebastián. The people deserve a say. But they also need guidance. Don’t underestimate how much they look to you.”

He glanced at her, a faint smile playing on his lips. “That’s what I’m afraid of. Power has a way of corrupting, even when it’s used with the best intentions. If I ever lose sight of why I’m doing this, everything falls apart.”

Elena:
“Then don’t lose sight. You’ve built something extraordinary. And for what it’s worth, I don’t think you’ll fall.”

Sebastián turned back to the city, his voice quiet but resolute. “We’ll see, Director Morales. For now, we move forward. There’s still so much to do.”

### **Chapter X: The Silent War**     
     
The air in Casa Montalvo’s private study was heavy with the scent of old leather and freshly brewed coffee. Sebastián Montalvo y Estrella sat behind a carved mahogany desk, reviewing a stack of financial reports. Across from him stood Martín Montalvo, his cousin and the family’s representative in the Puerto Rican Banking Guild.

Martín adjusted his glasses, his tone professional but edged with concern.

Martín:
“We’ve traced some of the funding for Aleida Soria’s operations. It’s routed through dummy corporations tied to the North American Trade Federation. They’re funneling resources into her network, likely to destabilize Mars and the Aegis Accord.”

Sebastián leaned back, steepling his fingers. “And our response?”

Martín:
“We’re leveraging our partnerships. The Montalvo family banks are discreetly tightening credit for businesses with ties to the Federation. Additionally, our allies in the guild are conducting a quiet audit of suspect transactions. It’s slow work, but we’ll cut off her resources.”

Sebastián nodded. “Good. The more isolated she becomes, the fewer options she’ll have. But we need to move faster. Soria’s privateers are growing bolder by the day.”


---

The Banking Guild

Martín opened a leather-bound ledger, its pages filled with elegant script detailing the accounts and assets of the Montalvo family and their partners.

Martín:
“The Guild’s leading families are on board—Ramos, Vélez, and Del Valle have pledged their support. They see the consolidation of the Bayamón district as an opportunity to strengthen the Crown’s influence and stabilize the island’s economy. If we can finalize the duchy’s incorporation, we’ll have the financial leverage to counter Soria’s disruptions.”

Sebastián studied the ledger, his mind racing through the implications. The Bayamón Duchy would be a cornerstone of Puerto Rico’s expanding governance model, but it also represented a delicate balance of power.

Sebastián:
“And the Duke? Have we settled on a candidate?”

Martín hesitated. “There’s been talk of naming one of the Del Valle sons. They’re well-regarded, and their family has a history of loyalty to the Crown. But some of the other families are pushing for an outsider—someone without ties to the old networks.”

Sebastián frowned. “The wrong choice could alienate key allies. But if we choose someone too connected, we risk entrenching the very systems we’re trying to reform.”


---

A Calculated Gamble

Sebastián’s thoughts were interrupted by a secure call from Director Elena Morales. Her face appeared on a nearby screen, her expression focused but weary.

Elena:
“We’ve made progress on Soria. Her privateers are operating out of a series of hidden bases in the asteroid belt. The funding trails we’ve been following match Martín’s reports—they lead straight to the North American Trade Federation.”

Sebastián leaned forward. “And Soria herself?”

Elena:
“She’s been careful, but we’ve tracked her to a station near Ceres. It’s heavily fortified, and she’s surrounded by loyalists. Taking her down won’t be easy.”

Sebastián:
“Then we hit her where it hurts. Cut off her funding, disrupt her supply lines, and force her to make a move. If we can destabilize her network, she’ll have no choice but to surface.”

Elena nodded. “I’ll coordinate with Martín and the Guild. But Sebastián, we’re running out of time. If Soria consolidates her position, the Federation will use her as a foothold to undermine everything we’ve built.”


---

The Bayamón Duchy

That evening, Sebastián convened a meeting with the Montalvo family’s closest banking partners. The discussion centered on the final steps for incorporating the Bayamón district as a duchy.

Martín:
“The numbers are solid. The duchy’s revenue streams—ports, manufacturing, and agriculture—are more than enough to sustain its governance. But the transition will require significant upfront investment, particularly in infrastructure.”

Sebastián:
“Then we make the investment. The duchy isn’t just about economics—it’s a symbol of stability and progress. If we can make Bayamón a model for the other districts, it will strengthen the Crown’s legitimacy.”

The room buzzed with quiet agreement. Among the attendees were representatives of the Ramos and Vélez families, as well as a new face—Victoria Quintana, a sharp-eyed woman who had recently risen to prominence in the Guild.

Victoria:
“If I may, Governor, the success of this venture depends on more than just numbers. We need to ensure the people see the duchy as a benefit, not an imposition. That means transparency, accountability, and tangible improvements in their daily lives.”

Sebastián smiled faintly. “Spoken like someone who understands the stakes. You’re absolutely right, Victoria. And that’s why this has to be done carefully. The people must feel the change, not just see it on paper.”


---

As the meeting concluded, Sebastián pulled Martín aside.

Sebastián:
“Keep the pressure on Soria’s network. We can’t let her use this transition to her advantage.”

Martín:
“I’ll do what I can, but Sebastián… be careful. Soria isn’t just a threat to the colony or the Accord. She’s a threat to you. She knows how to exploit vulnerabilities, and she won’t hesitate to do so.”

Sebastián’s gaze hardened. “Then we give her no openings. This isn’t just a battle for Mars—it’s a battle for the future. And I intend to win.”

Seed Funding Rose In These Spaces,DACXI,1i8vr3f,2025-01-24 08:47:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DACXI/comments/1i8vr3f/seed_funding_rose_in_these_spaces/,Dacxi,,"[crunchbase](https://preview.redd.it/lhk6xr1t4yee1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=90f6f257f4773abd59b2c08b5be9234a0070dcdc)

When forecasting which startup sectors are likely to attract big follow-on rounds, it’s helpful to find areas that are already seeing a lot of large initial ones. For this, we can look to seed funding tallies.

Even as overall seed-stage investment [declined in 2024](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-data-analysis-ai-eoy-2024/#Seed%20settled), a few areas saw big gains. This includes the obvious category — artificial intelligence — as well as a subset of sectors largely focused on automating things that humans currently do.

Below, we look at four top picks.

# Robotics

Robotics isn’t the cheapest industry for building a new product. So when a newly minted startup does get funding, it’s often larger than a typical seed round.

This past year, examples abounded of companies in the space securing unusually large initial investments. One U.S. standout was San Francisco-based [The Bot Co.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-bot-company), a startup founded by former [Cruise](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cruise) CEO [Kyle Vogt](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kyle-vogt) that launched with $150 million in seed funding to further its vision of building robots to do household chores.

San Francisco-based [Physical Intelligence](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/physical-intelligence-834b), a developer of AI foundational models for robotics, was another investor favorite. It secured a $70 million seed round in March and a $400 million Series A in November. And China-based [Galaxy General](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/galaxy-bot/company_financials) also had a good year, picking up a $95 million angel round in June, plus another $70 million in November.

Large seed rounds contributed to boosting overall seed-stage funding to the robotics space to just over $1 billion in 2024

For each of the categories, we included funding rounds of $200,000 or more in our tally of total investment.” style=”box-sizing: border-box; color: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 0; font-family: inherit; font-optical-sizing: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-kerning: inherit; font-feature-settings: inherit; font-variation-settings: inherit; margin: 0px 0.1em 0px 0.2em; overflow: visible; text-transform: none; appearance: button; cursor: pointer; outline: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 5; top: -0.1em; display: inline-block; padding: 0.35em; border: none; border-radius: 0.3em; background-color: rgba(110, 110, 110, 0.2); backface-visibility: hidden; vertical-align: middle; text-decoration: none; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; transition-property: background-color; transition-duration: 0.25s;”>

— up a whopping 77% from a year ago. In addition, it helped that we’re seeing robust activity at the intersection of robotics and AI.

Moreover, the industry had a splashy year across stages in 2024, with several companies landing [jumbo-sized rounds for humanoid robots](https://news.crunchbase.com/robotics/ai-humanoid-robots-venture-funding-2024/).

# Accounting, tax prep and bookkeeping

Robots are omnipresent in futuristic sci-fi movies. Automated bookkeeping, not so much.

But while it might not be the most cinematically appealing of innovations, intelligent software for accounting is certainly attracting attention from investors lately. Much of that is directed at the seed stage.

Per Crunchbase [data](https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/saved/accounting-bookkeeping-tax-prep-seed/cc474240-a4ed-4852-abe0-57586ae6057c), startups tied to accounting, bookkeeping and tax preparation picked up $143 million in seed funding in 2024. That’s an increase of 70% from the prior year and only slightly below the 2021 peak.

AI fueled the gains. This included the largest funding recipient, [Light](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/light-e65e), a Danish startup offering an AI-powered general ledger for multinational companies that landed $13 million in June.

Among U.S. startups, two companies developing AI-enabled tools also snagged big rounds. [Tola](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tola), a provider of billing management tools for businesses, landed $10.2 million in seed financing in October. [Numeric](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/numeric-39a8), a provider of AI-enabled financial planning tools, secured $10 million in a May seed round, followed by a $28 million October Series A.

# Legal tech

Legal tech is interesting as it’s one of the few areas where seed funding hasn’t really declined from 2021 boom-era levels.

In each of the past four years, legal and legal tech startups have raised between $170 million and $200 million globally. That’s a very steady range given that most industries have seen dramatic year-to-year fluctuations as cycles rise and wane.

Last year, in what should come as a surprise to no one, startups applying AI to legal tech were the standout seed funding recipients, with particularly strong gains in the U.S. Overall U.S. seed funding to legal tech hit $93 million in 2024 — up 37% year over year.

The largest U.S. funding recipient was [Norm AI](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/norm-ai), a regulatory compliance platform that picked up $11 million in seed funding in January, followed by a $27 million Series A in June. Next was a $6.8 million seed round for [Garden](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/garden-01d0#overview), a provider of tools for patent lawyers.

# Artificial intelligence

We put artificial intelligence in the №4 slot not because it was the smallest, but because it was the most obvious category. Trend analysis tends to be more interesting when it begins with something you didn’t already know.

Nonetheless, it’s not like we could ignore AI either. After all, companies in Crunchbase’s AI-focused industry categories pulled in $7.6 billion in seed funding in 2024 — more than one-fourth of global investment at this stage.

Some of the largest rounds in the category were for the aforementioned AI robotics startups The Bot Co. and Physical Intelligence.

Other big seed deals for AI companies included a $142 million financing for [EvolutionaryScale](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/evolutionaryscale), a developer of biological artificial intelligence models for therapeutic design, and a $100 million round for Paris-based generative AI startup [H Company](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/holistic-ai-0946#overview).

# The age of AGI

We look to seed funding trends not only for an idea of where future fortunes might be made but also for a sense of cultural vibe shifts. If the most ambitious and skilled entrepreneurs are putting their energies in a particular space, that says a lot about how they envision the future unfolding.

What we are seeing lately seems to indicate a big vibe shift. In particular, we’re seeing a marked change from the overarching direction of seed financings several years ago, where there was more emphasis on tools and services to make humans’ lives more pampered and comfortable. In the 2010s — the era that birthed many consumer-facing app unicorns — we saw the rise of giants such as [Uber](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uber) and [Airbnb](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb) that accomplished these goals with a heavy reliance on human labor in the form of drivers and hosts.

These days, the focus seems increasingly on how to lessen our reliance on humans in the daily slog of getting things done. Robots will clean our houses, software will automate our bookkeeping and tax compliance, and AI will serve as our in-house research department.

**Solar Farm is currently has the highest rising TVL’s, it’s based around three assets.: BNB, Solar Panels and Power (in Gigawatts). Deposit BNB in exchange for Panels. Your Panels will go to work earning Power. You will earn 14.28% of your Panels per day in the form of watts shown under “Manage Solar Farm”.**

**Daily percentage is up to 14.20%. This depends on claiming habits, time of day you compound or deposit, TVL fluctuation. The contract is written to provide an optimal entry for any and all users, new or old.**

**This is the reason the Panels per BNB amount changes frequently with TVL fluctuation to provide an even playing field for any new user coming to Solar Farm and not giving the first user a head start.**

HOW DOES MINERS WORK?**The way it works is pretty simple - you deposit your funds into the miner rewards pool and you earn daily interest. Your deposit is locked forever and you cannot withdraw it. However, you can always Claim or Compound your pending rewards. You can earn up to 12% Daily depending on the project you decide to invest in.**HOW DOES DEFI WORK?**Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology. It is based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies.

Quantum Computing & Blockchain Privacy: What’s Next?,CryptoMoonShots,1i8og4k,2025-01-24 00:36:05,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1i8og4k/quantum_computing_blockchain_privacy_whats_next/,Significant_Wave_634,Other (chain not covered by other flairs),"Ever thought what it would be like if quantum computing collided with blockchain privacy? Well, the topic is buzzing in tech circles, and not without a reason. With quantum computers sure to always get more powerful, they can only threaten to break the very encryption that has kept our blockchain secure up until now. Imagine how hackers could crack into the encryption holding your cryptocurrency-or worse still, sensitive personal data.



The experts raise the alarm and warn that quantum machines can break up to 70% of the world's encryption systems. That opens the door to one pretty scary scenario called ""harvest now, decrypt later,"" whereby cybercriminals would be in a position to steal encrypted data today and wait for quantum technology to advance enough to access it.



But how would we defend from those imminent threats? Here comes quantum-resistant cryptography. Among the emerging solutions come Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC). Big names like IBM and Microsoft have already invested in these technologies for future-proofing their systems.



Quantum-resistant technology has been setting the new definition of security in blockchains by protecting digital assets from new quantum attacks. QANplatform, NCOG Earth Chain, and Quantum Resistant Ledger are leading examples. QRL implements an algorithm called eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) that bolsters its security. QAN uses the cryptographic set of algorithms known as CRYSTALS-Dilithium recommended by NIST. Such developments will keep blockchain networks resilient against an ever-evolving threat.



How do I  say: what is the best preparation that should happen regarding what awaits us, considering such an exciting meeting point between quantum computing and blockchain? Let's plunge into this highly important conversation about securing our digital security!"
What does AI say about Ripples opposition to the Strategic Reserve?,XRP,1i8fsph,2025-01-23 17:20:29,0,0.25,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRP/comments/1i8fsph/what_does_ai_say_about_ripples_opposition_to_the/,No-Carpenter-9184,XRPL,"Ripple, the company behind XRP and the XRP Ledger, would likely have several reasons for being opposed to a Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserve in the U.S., especially from a strategic, competitive, and philosophical perspective:

1. Competition with XRP

Ripple positions XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, offering faster transaction times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. A strategic reserve in BTC could increase the adoption and perception of Bitcoin as a global store of value, potentially overshadowing Ripple’s efforts to promote XRP as a superior alternative in terms of utility for payments and liquidity management.

2. Regulatory Focus

The establishment of a BTC reserve in the U.S. would likely draw significant attention from regulators, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a foundational digital asset in the financial system. This could shift focus away from Ripple’s efforts to lobby for more favorable regulatory treatment of XRP, especially with the ongoing legal battles Ripple has faced regarding whether XRP is a security or a currency.

3. Energy and Sustainability Concerns

Bitcoin is often criticized for its energy consumption due to its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Ripple and XRP use a more energy-efficient consensus algorithm, the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, which doesn’t rely on mining. Ripple has long emphasized the lower environmental impact of XRP. A BTC reserve would seemingly contradict global efforts toward sustainability, which Ripple actively promotes as part of its branding and mission.

4. Philosophical Differences

Ripple’s mission has focused on integrating digital assets with the traditional financial system, working closely with banks, payment providers, and financial institutions to facilitate cross-border payments. Bitcoin, by contrast, was created with the intention of decentralizing financial power and reducing reliance on institutions. Ripple may oppose the idea of centralizing Bitcoin into a reserve because it aligns more with their competitors’ (e.g., Bitcoin maximalists) philosophy than Ripple’s vision of working within the existing financial framework.

5. Diversion of Institutional Interest

If the U.S. establishes a BTC strategic reserve, it could redirect institutional interest toward Bitcoin, reinforcing its narrative as a digital gold or a hedge against inflation. Ripple has made significant efforts to attract institutional partners for cross-border payment solutions and liquidity management using XRP. A BTC reserve could undermine these efforts by drawing attention, investment, and resources toward Bitcoin instead.

In summary, Ripple would likely be concerned that a BTC strategic reserve in the U.S. would bolster Bitcoin’s status as a global reserve asset, divert regulatory and institutional focus away from XRP, and further entrench Bitcoin’s dominance, which would be counterproductive to Ripple’s objectives."

Peer-to-peer or server-based?,ClearlightStudios,1i86roy,2025-01-23 11:06:14,21,1.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearlightStudios/comments/1i86roy/peertopeer_or_serverbased/,Mean_Lychee7004,,"I’ve been researching the idea of making this app peer-to-peer (p2p like BitTorrent) rather than server-based in order to lean into the decentralized, people-led concept. I thought I would share my notes for discussion:

P2P-based architecture decentralizes content delivery and storage, shifting reliance away from centralized servers. Here’s how we could approach it:

Core Components
	1.	Video Storage and Distribution:
	•	Use a P2P file-sharing protocol like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for video storage and retrieval.
	•	Videos are split into chunks, distributed across peers, and retrieved using unique Content Identifiers (CIDs).
	•	Ensure efficient caching and replication to improve availability and reduce latency.
	2.	User Discovery and Networking:
	•	Implement a distributed hash table (DHT) for user discovery, where each user has a unique identifier (similar to BitTorrent).
	•	Use protocols like WebRTC for real-time peer-to-peer communication between users (e.g., for live video streaming).
	3.	Metadata Management:
	•	Store video metadata (title, description, hashtags, etc.) in a distributed ledger or a lightweight decentralized database (e.g., OrbitDB or a blockchain for immutability).
	•	Use cryptographic signatures to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
	4.	Content Moderation:
	•	Use a decentralized voting system where peers can flag inappropriate content.

The Algorithm:

Adding a machine learning (ML)-based “For You Page” (FYP) recommendation algorithm to a TikTok clone built on a P2P infrastructure would be challenging due to decentralized data storage, but it’s feasible with the right design. Here’s how you can integrate an ML-based FYP algorithm into your P2P system:

1. Core ML Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm would analyze user preferences to suggest personalized content. Popular models include:
	•	Collaborative Filtering: Based on similarities between users and their interactions.
	•	Content-Based Filtering: Based on video content features (tags, categories, etc.).
	•	Deep Learning Models:
	•	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): For analyzing sequential user interactions.
	•	Transformer models: For sophisticated context analysis of metadata, captions, and hashtags.
	•	Vision Models (e.g., CNNs): For understanding video content (visual patterns).

2. Training the Algorithm

Training a centralized model isn’t possible in a fully P2P setup. Instead, you can use Federated Learning:
	•	Federated Learning Process:
	•	Each user’s device trains a local version of the ML model using their interaction data (e.g., likes, comments, watch time).
	•	Only model updates (gradients) are shared with other peers (or a coordinating node), not raw data.
	•	Updates are aggregated to create a global model while maintaining user privacy.

3. Real-Time Recommendation in a P2P Network

Real-time recommendations on a P2P infrastructure can be achieved by:
	1.	Local Model Execution:
	•	The trained model runs locally on the user’s device to provide personalized recommendations.
	•	Input data: Metadata from nearby peers’ shared videos, user’s watch history, and preferences.
	2.	Distributed Metadata Retrieval:
	•	Use a DHT to query metadata of videos across peers.
	•	Rank these videos using the local ML model based on predicted engagement.

4. Handling Model Updates in P2P
	•	Global Aggregation:
	•	Select a “coordinator” node (could be dynamic) to aggregate model updates and broadcast the improved model back to peers.
	•	Alternatively, leverage distributed aggregation frameworks like Gossip Learning.
	•	Versioning:
	•	Use a version control mechanism (e.g., hash-based) for model updates to ensure consistency across peers.

5. Addressing Challenges
	1.	Limited Compute Resources:
	•	Use lightweight ML models (e.g., MobileNet, TinyBERT) that can run efficiently on edge devices.
	2.	Privacy:
	•	Federated learning inherently protects raw user data, but additional measures like Differential Privacy or Secure Aggregation can prevent information leakage.
	3.	Cold Start Problem:
	•	For new users, recommend trending videos or globally popular content based on non-personalized metrics.
	4.	Network Latency:
	•	Cache frequently recommended videos locally for faster access.

6. Example Workflow
	1.	Video Metadata Sharing:
	•	Users upload videos, and metadata is stored in the P2P network.
	2.	Local Interaction Data Collection:
	•	Each peer logs user interactions (e.g., watch time, skips, likes) locally.
	3.	Model Inference:
	•	The local ML model scores available videos in the P2P network for recommendation.
	4.	Model Update:
	•	Periodically, peers exchange encrypted model updates to improve the global recommendation system.

Technologies to Use
	•	ML Frameworks: TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile, or ONNX for edge inference.
	•	P2P Frameworks: IPFS, libp2p, or WebRTC.
	•	Federated Learning Tools: TensorFlow Federated, PySyft.

This architecture combines the decentralized nature of P2P systems with the personalization power of ML, ensuring scalability, privacy, and efficiency."
Is Web3 Changing Everything About Design? Unpacking the Decentralized Revolution,Design_WATC,1i83cgu,2025-01-23 08:28:59,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1i83cgu/is_web3_changing_everything_about_design/,weandthecolor,,"https://preview.redd.it/d6jf2g9nwqee1.jpg?width=1068&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdf2e68e430fb58154ec9c4ae34238708951dc25

Do you actually know how much of the internet is controlled by just a handful of companies? It's like we're all living in a digital world built by someone else. But what if that changed? What if we, the users, had a real say in how the internet works? What if we could own our data and participate in the evolution of the online world?

That's the promise of [Web3 and decentralized design](https://weandthecolor.com/web3-decentralized-design-revolutionary-impact/195153). It’s not just a tech buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how we think about the internet. Design, at its heart, is about crafting experiences. And when the power to shape those experiences shifts from centralized entities to the collective, well, that’s a game changer.

You've probably heard whispers about blockchain technology – yes, the same tech behind cryptocurrencies. But it’s so much more than that. Blockchain is the bedrock of this new, decentralized vision of the internet. It enables secure, transparent, and user-controlled systems. And this bedrock is shaking up the world of design in some pretty exciting ways. Imagine a world where your online interactions are more transparent and your data is truly yours.

Are you curious about how this new internet will change the look and feel of things? Are you ready to explore how this is impacting your work or your online life? Then let’s dive in (well, not literally, we promised to avoid that!).

**Demystifying Web3: It's About Taking Back Control**

Let’s get down to basics. Web3, at its core, is about decentralization. Forget the mega-servers owned by a few tech giants. Web3 uses a network of computers (the blockchain), working together. It’s like a shared, transparent ledger, where everyone can see and verify what's going on. It's about shifting the power from the center to the edges, to you and me.

This decentralized approach has huge implications. It affects everything from how we handle our data and interact in online communities to how we create and own digital assets. For designers, this means a total rethink of traditional processes. It means more collaboration and a stronger focus on community. It’s a shift towards design that's made with the user, not just for them.

**The Blockchain Impact: How Tech is Remaking Design**

The blockchain is like the engine that drives the Web3 revolution. It enables records that cannot be tampered with. It's a kind of digital notary that's open for everyone to see. It establishes trust in this decentralized system.

So, how is this changing design? For starters, it's creating new models of ownership. It's making digital scarcity a real thing, not just a theoretical concept. This is reshaping how we value digital art, and, by extension, digital experiences. These ideas are pushing the design process in totally new directions.

**NFTs: Owning the Unique in the Digital World**

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are a prime example of this new reality. Each NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital token that represents ownership of a particular item. That item could be a piece of digital art, a virtual collectible, or even a piece of metaverse real estate.

NFTs have completely changed the way we think about digital ownership. Artists can now sell their work directly to the audience without relying on traditional galleries or intermediaries. Think of the creative possibilities! This bypasses the gatekeepers and creates a more direct connection between the creator and the collector.

For designers, this provides new ways to control their creations. It’s a direct link to the consumer. It can even mean embedding unique designs within the NFT itself. It opens doors for a more intimate design experience that was previously not possible.

**Decentralized Platforms: Building a More Democratic Internet**

Beyond NFTs, Web3 is bringing about a new era of decentralized platforms. These platforms are built on open-source, community-driven principles. They're not controlled by one single entity. Instead of a Facebook-style giant, imagine a social media platform governed by the people who use it. This is the promise of decentralization in action.

A key example of this is **Ethereum**, the blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). This is a space where all sorts of platforms are being built. From marketplaces to social networks, Ethereum is a crucial piece of the puzzle. It enables all this decentralized innovation to take place.

Another example would be **Mastodon**, a decentralized alternative to traditional social media. Instead of a single, central server, Mastodon runs on a network of independent servers (called ""instances""). Users can choose an instance that fits with their interests and values, and interact with others in the wider network. It’s a real-world example of a platform owned and run by its users.

Decentralized platforms present designers with both exciting opportunities and challenges. How do you create a platform that is both easy to use and also respects the principles of decentralization? How do you create interfaces that encourage collaboration and community engagement? These are the key questions for design in this new era.

**Community-Driven Projects: Design Powered by the People**

One of the most exciting aspects of Web3 is this emphasis on community-led initiatives. In the past, design was often handled by a small team, behind closed doors. Web3 changes that. It involves the community in the design process from the get-go.

Imagine a design project where the users themselves are helping to shape its direction. This idea is fundamental to Web3. Community-driven design can look like DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), where decisions are made through community votes. Or, it can look like open-source projects where anyone can contribute.

This collaborative approach leads to designs that are more inclusive and diverse. It also makes sure the end product truly meets the needs of the community. It’s a step towards a more participatory design future.

**Navigating the Challenges of Decentralized Design**

Of course, this new world is not without its hurdles. Decentralized systems can be complex, and sometimes difficult to use. User interfaces have to be both accessible and secure. There is a learning curve for designers and users alike.

Another major challenge is educating the wider public about Web3. Many are still unfamiliar with blockchain and its potential. Clear, user-friendly design is essential to bring users onto these new platforms. Bridging that gap between technology and everyday life is crucial to widespread adoption.

**The Future of Design: Embracing Decentralization**

Despite these challenges, the possibilities of decentralized design are undeniable. As Web3 continues to evolve, expect to see more creative solutions emerge. Imagine a more transparent, accessible, and truly empowering online world.

Web3 isn't just a tech shift; it's a cultural one. It's a movement toward a more collaborative and equitable internet. Decentralized design is at the heart of it all. It's about crafting experiences that are genuinely owned by the people who use them.

So, is Web3 changing everything about design? Yes, absolutely. It's already having a big impact and will continue to reshape how we interact with the digital world. It’s time to get on board with this new era of creativity. What do you think? Are you ready to be part of this decentralized revolution?

Deepdive: Hala Systems x Hedera,Hedera,1i808p5,2025-01-23 05:14:14,35,0.98,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1i808p5/deepdive_hala_systems_x_hedera/,SrijanK,Use Case/DApp,"Hala Systems is a known Hedera [use-case](https://hedera.com/users/hala-systemsshowcased). It is a solid project which perfectly embodies the benefits of using a public network for data provenance and integrity.

**Hala Systems: an Introduction**  
Hala Systems builds unclassified remote AI and IoT sensing technologies that protect civilians in conflict zones. By collecting and analyzing data from multiple sources, the company generates actionable intelligence to predict, prevent, and respond to threats. Hala Systems enriches and disseminates alerts in real-time to protect communities. Their technologies also securely document war crimes evidence. By delivering early warnings and evidence trails, Hala Systems helps safeguard vulnerable populations through ethical, transparent monitoring.

Sentry is Hala’s early warning system that generates credible, real-time, situational awareness of threats in the toughest places on earth. Sentry uses artificial intelligence (AI) to instantaneously validate information from multiple sources, allowing stakeholders to detect, identify, and predict threats. \[[Source](https://hedera.com/hh_hala-systems-case-study_v3.pdf)\]

With 3.8 billion smartphones worldwide, each with a camera, Hala Systems can use Sentry to empower civilians to place undeniable truth in their own hands. For that to be possible, each image and video capture must be armed with immutable, tamper-proof data.

**At scale, Hala Systems can register millions of events per day consisting of video, photo, and audio files. With each click, metadata is emitted that provides powerful context including the originating device, the time it was captured, location, and more.**

When it comes to important events, like the very ones Sentry is monitoring, the team wanted to ensure this data was trusted between the civilians first capturing the image to its potential use in a court of law.

  
**Use of Hedera Public Network**  
Hala Systems uses Hedera to manage the metadata of user inputs and media produced in conflict zones. This provides external parties wanting to verify the information with credible details surrounding the who, what, where, and when of an event.

Each event logged to Hedera Consensus Service is signed by the issuing device’s keys and receives a consensus timestamp by the whole of the Hedera network. Hala Systems uses the IBM Blockchain Platform to act as their internal repository, preserving additional metadata to augment the auditable hash data sent to Hedera Consensus Service.

  
**Key Grants and Partnership** \[[Source](https://reliefweb.int/attachments/202f132a-7687-46f4-9b08-a7352b8b4316/Hala-Systems-Outcome-Case-Study.pdf)\]

currently I am in discussion with someone from the Cardano-community who told me that I have to delegate my voting-power to a DRep in order to be able to withdraw my staking-rewards. Since I have my ADA on a ledger, I cannot really do this directly but I have to use the cardano - gov - web  -app  - page and there to type in my seed-phrase.

I cannot believe that this is the only way. I will not type in my seed-phrase there since it would be my seed-phrase for my ledger which secures also other assets.

I don't really want to move my ADA anywhere else. What can I do instead or can I withdraw my staking-rewards anyway? I couldn't really find and clarifying ressources out there.

The Auditor’s Apocalypse,FreeWrite,1i7p5ni,2025-01-22 18:21:26,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeWrite/comments/1i7p5ni/the_auditors_apocalypse/,LeviZendt,,"The year is 2050, and good and evil have stopped pretending they weren’t in cahoots. Angels LLC was restructuring for the fourth time that fiscal quarter and Legion Incorporated had launched *HellCoin*, the world’s most volatile cryptocurrency. However, forensic accountants like Sarah Chen didn’t care about divine mergers or satanic ICOs—they cared about the numbers. Numbers, after all, never lied. They screamed.

Sarah was a Senior Forensic Accountant at Definitely Not Evil Tech Corp, a sinister company whose mission statement included “probably ethical, mostly legal.” She stumbled upon the world's end while auditing a spreadsheet flagged *AX\_Report\_Q2\_DEATHS\_FINAL\_NO\_REVISIONS.xlsx.* It was, ironically, the kind of Excel file that made her wish she’d chosen a more straightforward career, like lion taming or competitive knitting.

The file led to President-Elect Barron Blackmore, a man so blatantly evil that voters dismissed his campaign slogan, ""Making Apocalypse Great Again,"" as postmodern satire. Unfortunately, satire dies the moment it’s sworn into office. Sarah’s investigation uncovered that Barron wasn’t just metaphorically the spawn of evil. His parents were the Black Death Witch and the Red Snake, a power couple that redefined the phrase “toxic relationship.”

Her findings were buried in a PowerPoint file titled *Totally Not Evil Plans for World Domination.pptx,* complete with animated transitions and a jaunty slide about “Population Optimisation Through Climate-Sensitive Annihilation.” Here’s the kicker: the plan was working. Greenhouse gases were dropping. Coral reefs were regrowing. Nature was thriving. Humanity, meanwhile, was *not*.

As both brilliant and annoyingly ethical, Sarah tried to expose the scheme. She quickly learned that righteousness is far less practical than bulletproof vests. The government's *Department of Inconvenient Truth Suppression* classified her as a “Level 4 Threat to Order.” Her crime? Knowing too much and being gay, which apparently clashed with the regime’s “heteronormative end-of-the-world chic.” Her last act of defiance was an auditor’s final flourish: filing her assassination expenses under ""Miscellaneous Overhead.""

Meanwhile, resistance was forming in the Australian Outback, where even the flies were unionising for better working conditions. Known as the *Wasteland Warriors,* they were a mismatched team of climate refugees, disgruntled IT professionals, and Rita, an angry librarian who wielded a chainsaw like it was overdue.

The group’s leader, Dr. Alice “Mad Dog” Martinez, had three PhDs—quantum physics, interpretive dance, and motorcycle maintenance—which she claimed gave her ""multidisciplinary problem-solving skills."" She planned to infiltrate Barron’s government via its weakest point: middle management. Barron’s AI overlords had outsourced the day-to-day human oppression to humans themselves, assigning them the title of *“Change Agents.”* The job came with a mediocre salary, dental benefits, and the soul-crushing irony of maintaining a system designed to eradicate you.

Surprisingly, the infiltration went smoothly. The AI were too busy arguing about who deserved credit for the declining carbon emissions. (“It was my neural net!” “No, it was *my* machine learning model!”). The Warriors made it all the way to Barron’s office, where they found him practising evil monologues in a mirror.

“You’re too late,” Barron sneered, swirling a glass of wine. “My plan is flawless. The planet heals, the unworthy perish, and I, Barron Blackmore, become a *god!*”

“Alright, mate, but where’s the receipts for all this?” Dr. Martinez asked, scanning the room. “This is chaos. Is there no filing system? Rita, thoughts?”

“It’s a bloody mess,” growled Rita, hefting her chainsaw. “I’ll alphabetise his *face.*”

Barron tried to counter with mind control, but his efforts shattered against Dr. Martinez’s triple-layered psyche. “Nice try,” she said. “But I’ve defended three theses and survived interpretive break dance critiques. Your spooky mind tricks are amateur hour.”

The battle ended with a well-thrown stapler severed Barron’s jugular artery, a move Rita later described as ""worth more than the overdue fees.""

The Warriors stared at Barron’s lifeless body. Around them, screens showed the planet’s miraculous recovery: stabilising temperatures, retreating deserts, even dolphins smugly returning to Venice. The problem? The recovery required a death toll that made medieval plagues look restrained.

“This is awkward,” muttered Geoff, a former barista turned Resistance IT guy.

“Not if we spin it,” said Martinez. “Barron stapled himself to death. Tragic workplace accident.”

“And us?” Geoff asked.

“We’re the new government,” Martinez declared. “Congratulations, team. You’re now the Department of Sustainable Future Planning.”

The Warriors rebranded Barron’s eugenics program into the *Voluntary Entropy Management Initiative,* a kinder, gentler population control approach involving mandatory mindfulness apps and composting workshops. Killer robots were repurposed into therapy bots, delivering passive-aggressive life advice like, *“Maybe if you recycled properly, we wouldn’t be in this mess.”*

The death rate remained steady, but now people were dying from embarrassment at being scolded by a robot named *Therap-E.*

In the end, humanity survived. The remaining population lived in harmony with the AI overlords, whose passion for recycling bordered on obsessive. And somewhere in the great cosmic accounting ledger, Sarah Chen’s ghost was still trying to file the apocalypse under the correct tax year.

A plaque in the new government’s office read:

""In honour of those who balanced the planet's books. The final audit was brutal, but at least the accounts are now reconciled."""
AI Wave On MultiversX: New Breed of AI Agents Ready to Redefine Web3,MultiversXOfficial,1i7hazb,2025-01-22 12:58:39,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiversXOfficial/comments/1i7hazb/ai_wave_on_multiversx_new_breed_of_ai_agents/,AxedLens1,Announcements,"We’re used to LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok acting as savvy assistants. They can summarize protocols, brainstorm governance proposals, or explain technical concepts. But that always felt like a half-step. The true potential of AI in Web3 is unlocked when these models can directly access and update on-chain data. Picture a scenario where a DAO relies on an AI agent to not just draft a spending proposal, but actually implement it once it passes. Or a user asking a smart AI agent to dynamically adjust parameters based on real-time user behavior—without a human flipping switches behind the scenes. 

[MultiversX | Eliza ](https://preview.redd.it/ceckxbop3lee1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a25e89aae3692275ecfe035dcbd71a891d8fd6c3)

In other words, this framework doesn’t just let AI “see” what’s on-chain; it empowers AI to become an on-chain actor. It’s like giving an LLM arms and legs in the blockchain world, enabling it to perform trusted, verifiable operations that used to require complex manual intervention or custom-coded middleware.

**Why It Matters**  
Today’s Web3 space is still too siloed. Information gets stuck in corners—data might be on-chain, but your AI tooling is off-chain. The result is a constant friction between analyzing blockchain data and doing something meaningful with it. Now, by letting AI agents operate on-chain, developers can build dApps that are not just automated, but intelligent. We’re talking about systems that react to changing conditions, optimize parameters on the fly, and make the user experience simpler and more intuitive.

This evolution is about more than fancy features. It’s about trust and verifiability. Because everything on-chain is transparent and immutable, these AI-powered decisions aren’t guesswork happening behind a curtain. Instead, they become part of a shared ledger that anyone can verify. We’re demonstrating a new layer of accountability, where AI actions are as auditable and tamper-proof as any smart contract.

**MultiversX unveils AI Agents integration Today – Cook with Eliza and AI16z**

So what does this all mean today? 

1. The number #1 trending agent framework in the world is live on MultiversX  – [link](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza)

4. The tools are here, MultiversX Growth Games will accelerate this movement – [start building and apply here](https://multiversx.com/growthgames)

**The Start of a Big Wave**  
This first step is just the foothold—what we do next will define where this goes. Today, it might seem cutting-edge that an agent can run a few on-chain instructions or manage a liquidity pool autonomously. Tomorrow, it’ll be table stakes. We’ll see entire ecosystems of agents that compose and interact with each other, forming an intelligent, adaptive Web3 layer.

This isn’t just adding another tool to the belt; it’s planting a flag in a new territory. It signals a shift where the blockchain isn’t just a ledger we periodically poke for data, but an environment for dynamic, AI-driven workflows. A place where agents can live and breathe, continuously adjusting and building toward new goals, without human micromanagement.

We’re at the beginning of a wave. The infrastructure to connect AI and on-chain logic just came online, and the pioneering builders are about to show what’s really possible. 

Over time, these capabilities will define the user experience of blockchain-based apps: always-on, always-learning, and always improving. For anyone who’s ever looked at the gap between AI smarts and blockchain power and wondered when they’d finally come together—this is it. 

The future we’ve been speculating about is taking shape, and it’s going to be a wild ride.

Build mode on!

Seamless Blockchain Integration with Expert Consultancy: The Future of Business Innovation,Spydra_Blockchain,1i75d6a,2025-01-22 01:57:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spydra_Blockchain/comments/1i75d6a/seamless_blockchain_integration_with_expert/,MarketingModrator,,"

https://preview.redd.it/ixhqwuvuthee1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=89c7c39d42ee1033c9db27ae859546844f2a32ac

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way businesses operate, providing unprecedented transparency, security, and efficiency. With an increasing number of industries looking to integrate blockchain solutions, *seamless blockchain integration* has become a top priority for forward-thinking organizations. From finance to healthcare, asset tokenization, and supply chain management, blockchain's versatility is its strongest suit. However, the complexity of integrating blockchain into existing systems can pose significant challenges. This is where *Blockchain Consulting Services* play a crucial role. By leveraging expert consultancy, businesses can navigate this intricate process more effectively, ensuring that blockchain integration is not only smooth but also scalable and sustainable.

# The Power of Blockchain: Why You Should Integrate It

In 2023, the global blockchain market was valued at $11.7 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 82.4% from 2023 to 2030. This rapid growth is a testament to blockchain's transformative potential across various industries. By utilizing *blockchain consulting services*, businesses can ensure they harness this potential efficiently. Blockchain's decentralized nature allows for increased transparency, security, and immutability, all of which are crucial for sectors like finance, healthcare, and even government services.

# Asset Tokenization: The Next Big Thing

One of the most promising applications of blockchain is *asset tokenization*. By converting real-world assets like real estate, stocks, and even artwork into digital tokens on a blockchain, businesses can create new markets, streamline transactions, and enhance liquidity. According to a report by PwC, the tokenized assets market is expected to reach $24 trillion by 2027. This presents enormous opportunities for businesses, but successful implementation requires careful planning and expert guidance from blockchain consultants.

By leveraging expert consultancy, organizations can explore the full potential of *asset tokenization* while ensuring that compliance, security, and market readiness are addressed. Tokenizing assets on a blockchain simplifies transactions, reduces fraud, and enhances operational efficiency. Blockchain consulting services provide crucial insights into selecting the right blockchain platform, ensuring interoperability, and ensuring that the tokenization process is seamless and secure.

# The Role of Blockchain Consulting Services

While blockchain has vast potential, its integration into existing business systems isn't without challenges. Companies often encounter difficulties in adapting to new technology, understanding how to structure blockchain-based solutions, and ensuring that the solution fits with their business model. This is where blockchain consultants come into play.

[Blockchain consultants ](https://www.spydra.app/blockchain-solutions-consultancy)offer tailored solutions that align with your business objectives. They help companies with everything from selecting the right blockchain technology to training employees and ensuring ongoing support. Their expertise ensures that businesses achieve a smooth integration and avoid common pitfalls that can result in project delays or failure.

Here’s how [blockchain consulting services](https://www.spydra.app/blockchain-solutions-consultancy) can ensure seamless integration:

1. **Strategic Planning**: Blockchain consultants help businesses define clear objectives and develop a roadmap for integrating blockchain into their existing infrastructure. This strategic planning minimizes disruptions and maximizes the value of blockchain solutions.
2. **Platform Selection**: The blockchain ecosystem is vast, with numerous platforms available for different use cases. Whether it’s Ethereum, Hyperledger, or Solana, choosing the right platform is essential for long-term success. Expert consultants assist businesses in making informed decisions based on their specific needs and goals.
3. **Custom Development**: Blockchain solutions are rarely one-size-fits-all. Consultants work with businesses to develop custom blockchain applications that address unique challenges while integrating with existing IT systems. This ensures that businesses get a solution that is both practical and scalable.
4. **Security & Compliance**: Blockchain is often seen as a highly secure technology, but integrating it improperly can introduce vulnerabilities. Consultants ensure that your blockchain solution adheres to industry standards and regulations while mitigating potential risks.
5. **Ongoing Support and Optimization**: Blockchain integration doesn’t stop at implementation. Expert consultants provide continuous support, helping businesses optimize performance, troubleshoot issues, and evolve with changing market conditions.

# Benefits of Seamless Blockchain Integration

A seamless blockchain integration can transform a business in several ways, offering immediate and long-term advantages:

* **Increased Efficiency**: Blockchain’s automation of processes reduces manual intervention, streamlines workflows, and accelerates transaction speeds. This efficiency can lead to cost savings and a more agile business model.
* **Improved Transparency and Trust**: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides transparency and trust, which is particularly important for industries such as finance and healthcare, where data integrity is critical.
* **Enhanced Security**: The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it highly resistant to data breaches and fraud. Transactions are cryptographically secured, which enhances overall cybersecurity.
* **Faster Transactions and Payments**: Through tokenization and smart contracts, blockchain reduces the time and cost associated with traditional transactions. Cross-border payments, for instance, can be completed in minutes, rather than days.

# Conclusion

As the blockchain market continues to grow, businesses that embrace seamless blockchain integration will be better positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Whether through *asset tokenization* or enhancing business processes, the potential benefits are immense. However, to ensure that blockchain integration is both efficient and secure, expert *blockchain consulting services* are crucial. By partnering with experienced consultants, businesses can navigate the complexities of blockchain technology and implement solutions that deliver tangible, long-term results.

Don’t let the complexity of blockchain integration hold your business back. Start your journey toward seamless integration today with the help of trusted blockchain consultants, and unlock the future of business innovation."
Blockchain based shared token for emergencies only.,myideasforhumanity_80,1i72z4w,2025-01-21 23:27:50,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/myideasforhumanity_80/comments/1i72z4w/blockchain_based_shared_token_for_emergencies_only/,Nvestnme,,"Your idea outlines a blockchain-based decentralized financial ecosystem designed to foster mutual trust and shared resources. Here’s how this concept could work in detail:

1. System Overview:
	•	Structure: A decentralized, blockchain-powered platform where members contribute funds into a common pool.
	•	Tokenization: Each member receives a token representing their stake and participation rights in the system.
	•	Purpose: The pool acts as an emergency fund, accessible to members under specific conditions.

2. Key Features:

a. Membership and Contribution:
	•	Initial Contribution: Members invest an equal amount (e.g., $20) to join.
	•	Probation Period: New members are vetted by existing members, ensuring transparency and trust before being granted full access to resources.
	•	Community Vetting: New members’ applications are subject to a majority vote.

b. Borrowing and Fund Access:
	•	Emergency Loans: Members can request access to funds for emergencies, subject to community approval.
	•	Borrowing Limits: A member cannot request additional funds until prior debts are repaid.
	•	Voting System: Token holders vote on whether to release funds to a requester. A majority or predefined quorum is needed for approval.
	•	Repayment Mechanism:
	•	Profit Sharing: Members can contribute profits from investments to repay debts.
	•	Manual Repayment: Members may upload funds to clear their debt.
	•	Flexible Repayment: The system allows gradual repayment over time, tailored to members’ financial situations.

c. Governance:
	•	Decentralized Voting: Token holders collectively decide:
	•	Fund disbursements.
	•	Approval of new members.
	•	Amendments to rules or protocols.
	•	Smart Contracts: Automate processes like fund allocation, repayments, and voting results, ensuring transparency and immutability.

d. Security and Transparency:
	•	Blockchain Ledger: Tracks all transactions and fund movements.
	•	Auditability: Members can view the status of the pool, outstanding loans, and repayment schedules.
	•	Identity Verification: To prevent abuse, members are required to verify their identity.

3. Benefits:
	•	Shared Responsibility: The system encourages accountability and fosters a sense of community.
	•	Accessibility: Members have a financial safety net for emergencies.
	•	Autonomy: Decentralized governance ensures no single entity controls the pool.
	•	Trustless Transactions: Smart contracts reduce the need for intermediaries.

4. Challenges and Solutions:

a. Abuse of Funds:
	•	Solution: Implement a reputation score for members and limit borrowing frequency.

b. Non-Repayment Risks:
	•	Solution: Pool reserves to cover unpaid debts and penalize defaulters (e.g., revoke voting rights or participation privileges).

c. Decision-Making Delays:
	•	Solution: Set predefined voting periods for quicker decision-making.

d. Probation Vetting Fairness:
	•	Solution: Use identity verification and require contributions to be locked during probation.

5. Technical Implementation:

a. Blockchain:
	•	Choose a blockchain network supporting smart contracts (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).

b. Token System:
	•	Use a fungible token to represent stakes (ERC-20 standard).
	•	Optionally, integrate a reputation-based NFT system for member profiles.

c. Smart Contracts:
	•	Design contracts for:
	•	Contribution locking.
	•	Voting mechanisms.
	•	Fund disbursement and repayment tracking.

d. User Interface:
	•	Create a simple, intuitive app or web portal for members to:
	•	Monitor funds.
	•	Submit loan requests.
	•	Vote on proposals.
	•	Track repayment progress.

6. Long-Term Vision:
	•	Expand the pool’s capabilities to support investments, such as:
	•	Venture funding.
	•	Interest-based lending.
	•	Profit-sharing opportunities.
	•	Introduce staking or yield farming options to grow the pool reserves.
	•	Build partnerships with external financial ecosystems for added liquidity and benefits.

*Hurdop Prime*

A'kifab frowned as he read the message on the tablet. Minister Aa'Porti as well as Minister of War Aa'tebul had been effusive in their public praise with respect to Commodore A'drapir - what he'd been told already differed from the stories broadcast on the news. The Hurdop newscasts were grimly pleased at the death of the Savager of Bardeen. The Vilantians by contrast were in mourning garb extolling the virtues of the final actions of the Liberator of Bardeen - his fleet outnumbered, he piloted a small shuttle into the midst of the pirate fleet and detonated a pulse bomb, disabling the pirate fleet at the cost of his shuttle life support and ultimately his own life.

This version was somewhat sanitized from what he'd been told - of course there was some difference from the War Ministry's version of events. What he received was a thinly-veiled warning, indicating that the Commodore had attacked the Nameless Captain and was overwhelmed. With the choice of honorless defeat or honorable death, the Commodore selected the latter after naming his successor. This was in keeping with the Clan Way - and his life would be held as an example to the nobles while comforting the commons. Of course, A'kifab would need to do his part in comforting the commons.

A'kifab considered his options for a moment. He and his fellow unlanded Lords had a new option - he glanced up over to the door of his study.

""Jojorn? Do you have a moment?""

The girl came in quickly, looking serious. ""Yes, sir.""

""Have you been able to speak with your crew and the Ensign Nhoot?""

""Yes to both, sir.""

""Did they say anything of importance?""

""My crew is grateful for the food and employ; we wish to earn our way as quickly as possible.""

""Do not worry – that opportunity will come soon. What of Nhoot?""

Jojorn read from a tablet. ""She said that Captain Papa was in a fight and that XO Rosie said many of the Bad Words to someone who said they were doing what the Minister of War and the Clan Way wanted them to do. And then she opened the door a little to smell what was going on and Captain Papa smelled very scared and serious and everyone else smelled a little scared but angry. And then other ships showed up and the fighting stopped and then they went home and they were worried but happy. And then she said that as soon as they got home Papa got news and they had to go fast.""

There was a slight smile at the report. ""Thank you Jojorn. Go back to your studies and study hard. We will have need of your skills soon – my friends and I will be contracting with the Terran Foreign Legion soon, you along with your crew be flying one of the ships we send to Terra. However, the ship we have lacks a name. Consider it well.""

Jojorn nodded solemnly. ""I will ensure the crew has a name for our ship.""

*Homeplate, Headquarters of the 7th Cavalry and the Terran Foreign Legion*

The *Twilight Rose* made its way to their newly assigned permanent berth. Not quite as far away from their company area as the dry-dock, but it would still allow the crew to indulge themselves in their rope-climbing skills. They had no sooner docked and opened the hatch for exit when an announcement was made through Rosie.

""On behalf of the Colonel, we of the 7th congratulate the entire crew of the *Twilight Rose* for successful escort and subsequent action. Normally there would be a ceremony attending such things, however the Captain's wife is currently in labor. Therefore Captain Gryzzk is to report to medical. Quickly.""

Gryzzk blinked, checked the calendar on his tablet, and blinked again as he realized that yes, the due date was a few days prior. He tapped his tablet for directions and ran as fast as he could to the medical bay, where a nurse was waiting with an apron and mask.

""Congratulations, Captain."" The nurse's eyes held a smile as he was escorted to the labor and delivery area - not that it was precisely needed, as he could follow Grezzk's scent through the corridors despite the overwhelming antiseptic permeating the walls.

He arrived to see his wife panting heavily with her hands gripping a metal frame while her lower half was submerged. A doctor coaching her calmly while a nurse checked her vitals. The frame had bent slightly, which was a touch concerning to Gryzzk.

Grezzk looked up to see him, and her scent changed from birthing pain to birthing anger.

""**YOU**. Let me out of this so that I can stab him in eyeball! I want to stab him for this! He deserves to be stabb-yiiiieaagh!"" The rest of whatever she was going to say was cut off as another contraction hit and the frame bent perilously. The contraction subsided, leaving Grezzk panting again and the frame was left slightly more misshapen.

For his part, Gryzzk remembered when Gro'zel greeted the world – it wasn't much different on the face of it, save the frame being sturdier. As soon as he got near, Grezzk grabbed his wrist with frightening strength.

""We will have four children. No more. Our family is enough. Soon. I will - "" Another contraction hit and whatever else she was going to say was subsumed in a wave of agony and Gryzzk had to clench his jaw to keep from letting out a cry of pain as she clamped down on his wrist hard and a final cry before the doctor leaned into the pool quickly. ""One...and two sons. Congratulations to both of you.""

The newest yowling members of the family were placed in warm towels and presented to their parents. Gryzzk ignored his aching wrist to hold his son in his arms before speaking softly. ""Hello Ghabri.""

The infant looked up at him and stopped howling before blinking all of his eyes. Then the newest member of the family peed on his overjoyed father.

There was a soft chuckle of sorts, as the infants were exchanged, and Gryzzk was able to hold Glaud for a moment. Unlike his brother, Glaud seemed to be quiet and watching everything with a sort of fascination. Gryzzk hummed softly to them both before the infants were taken to be weighed, named, and all the necessary entries made to ensure that the children were in fact healthy.

Gryzzk leaned over to give his wife a soft nuzzle as she leaned into him for a moment.

""I need to rest now, my handsome hand. The children have been very active the past few days knowing you were coming home."" She exhaled softly as the tank was drained.

""My rose, we are home and safe. We will have the home in order when you bring the twins to greet their sisters.""

They shared a quiet moment while her legs were dried and Grezzk was lifted onto a gurney to be taken to recovery. Gryzzk smiled a little before he was able to exit. He glanced down and realized that Grezzk had squeezed his wrist *very* hard. He wandered to find an aid station, where the nurse lifted an eyebrow until Gryzzk explained what had transpired. After that there were congratulations and a coldpack for his wrist.

As he exited the medical facility he was greeted by a sea of purple in the form of the entire company waiting for news. He smiled gently as they went quiet. ""Two sons. Mother and children are doing well.""

This statement was greeted with cheers that morphed into howls as a crowd of nearly two hundred celebrated and jumped up and down – it was as if they'd all won a sporting match or something. Gryzzk managed a small smile as Nhoot and Gro'zel both ran up and sat on his feet. Finally Gryzzk waved for quiet.

""Everyone, listen. Please, I thank you but this is still the medical area and we need to disperse. You are dismissed but I will expect reports tomorrow morning so we can repair the ship and get ourselves ready for our next job. If you'd like to celebrate, we have the company area. I will be there later, but for now my daughters need a healthy meal.""

There was a bit of laughter at that, but they still clapped and cheered even as they dispersed themselves. Gryzzk found himself walking carefully to his quarters, with the door opening to him.

He somehow felt very relaxed, even as Nhoot told Gro'zel about everything that had happened and her new friends from the ship and all the things that had happened. He moved through the evening in a daze of sorts as he was able to find that Grezzk had prepared a homecoming meal of sorts. He found in the refrigerator a large bowl of landis'og and a reminder to warm it up. He was able to manage that much, and Gro'zel was listening in rapt attention as Nhoot was telling stories about Jonesy, the crew, and the battles they'd fought since they left. Once they finished eating, Gryzzk settled on the couch to catch up on the news. As New Casablanca was mostly a Terran mercenary outpost the news was Terran, with a business section for the aspiring leaders of tomorrow to learn more about new tactics, weapons, and - most importantly - maximizing profit margins.

The latest item was regarding the tactical engagement between the Third Vilantian Warfleet/Sword of the Light Gods company and the Terran Foreign Legion. This was analyzed in detail as if it were a sporting match, with long-range sensors and close-range sensor logs pulled from as many ships as they could. The 7th Cav's commanding officer had released their sensor and sanitized communication logs, and gave a statement of praise to the crew and especially the Captain of the *Twilight Rose*. It seemed to be one part truth, one part advertising monologue. Both of the girls giggled and leaned on Gryzzk while watching, while several analysts around a table pointed out various flaws in each side's tactical plan. The Vilantian flaws were obvious in that while they moved as a unit, a single error would seem to cripple their fleet - it was noted that there was no movement on their side, even though they still appeared to have some capability to maneuver.

The performance of the *Twilight Rose* was praised, however they noted how certain shield systems would have helped them with damage and they also commented that Gryzzk's performance was heavily dependent on the actions of his bridge staff. Overall, he was graded as smart enough to know when he wasn't smart enough - which was enough to give him a pass with a caution that he wasn't going to be that lucky every time. They advised that Gryzzk was going to have to spend some time in a command simulator before they'd give him a better grade - that gave the commentators an opportunity to pitch their favored systems to any listening mercenary interested. Their final judgment seemed to paint Gryzzk as a promising rookie with a lot of potential in ""The League"" as the mercenary companies were known.

The other thing that was noted was an aside that when the Sword of the Light Gods was asked for comment, the reply was simply that Commodore A'Drapir was no longer in command. The lack of communication was seen as a bad sign, as other mercenary companies would put out statements that doubled as advertisements after failure. Gryzzk had seen enough things happen to know that the Commodore had been given a choice based on his station. With either choice, the Commodore would not be seen again. He found himself focusing in order to keep his thoughts from drifting to Grezzk.

Overall, it seemed to be a casual night – and Gryzzk found himself nodding off a bit before snapping awake to put the girls to bed. They were only slightly argumentative before bedtime stories and then falling asleep, leaving Gryzzk to nuzzle them both for a moment before he took himself to bed.

Morning arrived with a soft alarm. Today was going to be a busy day, but Gryzzk launched himself at the day. In theory, Grezzk would be bringing the children home. He checked to ensure their room was prepared and ready, and smiled softly at the surprise he had for Gro'zel. He caught himself looking for Rosie and Chief Tucker for a moment before catching himself and remembering that he wasn't on the ship. He checked his tablet to ensure that the status paperwork for the married couples had gone through the proper command channels, and that his award and bonus recommendations had gone through. Finally, he checked the ledger and nodded as their first cruise had turned a bit more profit than expected. It seemed that life as a mercenary wasn't the worst occupation, particularly when he checked his own balance.

The girls were able to take care of themselves and took being pride in their independence – or at least their ability to make breakfast. Gryzzk grabbed his tablet for a very fast call with his wife to ensure that Grezzk was going to be escorted to the company area once she was deemed fit to do so in a few hours. There was also some additional administrative details that he had to confirm and send to the ship's printer. Gryzzk smiled softly and kept that tidbit to himself as he had the printer make two sets of ensigns tabs that were going to be part of the celebration – along with the other awards that he was going to be handing out during the course of the day. Then he sat both of the girls down.

""Alright, Mama's coming home today, and we're going to be doing things. I have a special question for both of you. When I go out to work, I need one of you to stay home and one to come with me. This time it was Nhoot and next time it's going to be you Grozel - if you want to. It's going to be a few weeks before we're ready to go out again, so you don't have to answer now. But you would be the Morale Officer while on the ship, and you have to learn things - and make sure that people who are sad have someone to talk to."" Nhoot was nodding furiously, jumping up and down.

Gro'zel seemed to be considering it deeply before she also nodded. ""I can do that Papa.""

Gryzzk smiled softly. ""Very well. Your first job is to get into proper uniform, because we will be having a day with the company at lunch to let them know.""

Their eyes both lit up as they ran into their room to change. Gryzzk took a satchel and put all the various items he'd had printed in them for distribution. They came out with their uniforms unadorned with rank tabs, and allowed Gryzzk to fuss over them for a few moments to ensure that they were clean and ready to be seen before he took their hands to walk from Officers' Country to the company area.

As they walked to the company area, Gryzzk found himself being accompanied by his department heads, each trailing behind and looking appropriately serious, but his nose caught the scent of gleeful anticipation. There appeared to be something amiss that was probably going to be amusing – to the Terrans at least.

They climbed the stairs up to the company area for the first surprise. The entire area had been repainted in the company colors, with several murals in gold and red depicting the ship colors and twilight rose decorations surrounding the entryways. Gryzzk stopped to take it all in and gave a slight smile at their work. The area proper had been reset with benches for everyone to sit on and relax. While the air was formal, there was also some happiness there. The day looked to be shaping up quite nicely.

As he and his officers passed around to the head of the table, Gryzzk felt a measure of pride in his chest. They'd managed it. All of them. And as the captain, the responsibility was his. It felt odd, as if he was receiving some unearned glory. Certainly everyone he asked would say otherwise, but Gryzzk was resolved to ensure that those who had done their parts received their due as well.

O'Brien and the NCO group were at the head of table, as everyone settled in. Slowly, until O'Brien raised her voice.

""OI! You lot settle down, Captain's got something to tell your raggedy asses!""

That settled them down almost immediately. Gryzzk's fur fluffed a bit in amusement as he set the satchel down. It was still unnerving to address everyone, but it was his duty and privilege to do so. He made certain that the small tuft of his fur from his initial rallying speech was in front of him.

""Everyone settle down. First off, congratulations to everyone here. We had a successful shakedown, and the powers that lie above us are pleased with this. I'll be handing out awards and other things at this time. Since this is a mercenary company, I must stipulate that each of these awards does come with a monetary bonus. First off, the whole company has been awarded the Shakedown Medal with a combat cluster – not every ship comes back from their first cruise. And seeing action like we did on a first assignment is unusual, or so I'm told. Secondly, the armory squad will be receiving additional awards for the successful boarding action. Thirdly, we are going to be stood down for a few weeks while the damage to ship is assessed and repaired, we'll be using that time well to apply what we've learned and improve. Lastly, Private Prumila - step forward.""

Prumila looked around nervously as she scuttled forward. Her injuries had been mostly healed, but she was walking around.

There was a barely hidden smile on Gryzzk's face as he spoke. ""For conspicuous gallantry in your actions, placing the lives of others above your own, you are hereby awarded as follows: The Shining Star, third class along with a Purple Heart for wounds received during said action. Finally, you are hereby promoted one step to Private, First Class."" With each award, Gryzzk placed a small medal on her uniform, and finally placed a new rank tab on her collar. ""Let her actions be an example to us all."" With that he gave small howl of approval that was quickly taken up by the company at large.

Prumila, for her part was very surprised and overjoyed by this. She quickly returned to her place where her squadmates ruffled her fur and gently elbowed her in praise.

""Next item for the company – as a result of brevet ensign Nhoot's actions, she is hereby promoted to full ensign. In addition to this, she will be partnering with Gro'zel as they each take turns as the ship's Morale Officer."" Upon saying this, Gryzzk gave both of his daughters their gold bars for their rank. They saluted him as best they could, and he returned the salutes with a smile.

""Last item on the agenda. As a result of the various fines as issued by the First Sergeant and XO, tomorrow night we will be having a company party at Sparrows in New Casablanca. The bar will be open, with music and entertainment. Don't overdo it though. That is all I have for you today, however if you stay in the area we will have special guests arriving shortly. First Sergeant, the company is yours."" As Gryzzk settled in, part of his mind was complimenting him, and the other part considered the possibility that he'd rather face the Third Warfleet again before doing another one of these.

O'Brien smirked as she stood up. ""Alright you lot. Not so long ago, Captain challenged every twisted nipple among us. Time to answer."" After saying that, she tugged at the end of her hair and with a small blade she trimmed off a small piece and set it next to Gryzzk's. Unlike when he first came in, the company area was dead silent as the entire company took some hair from arms, faces, and in the case of the Vilantians and Hurdop fur from their chest with hidden trimmers and added it to Gryzzk's fur. When it was Prumila's turn, Gryzzk placed the fur she had already given him next to his - which caused a bit more fur-ruffles and elbows from her squad.

Once it was done, Gryzzk swallowed and looked around. ""I know that normally, I'm supposed to say something. But it is difficult to form words. I can only say that this is not just...a company. This is a family that we have forged. It is an oath to each other. Wherever the stars take us, we are among brothers and sisters.""

There was cheering and howling jubilantly, which only increased as Doc Cottle pushed Grezzk into the company area. She had a small bundle tucked into each elbow, and was smiling brightly despite the apparent exhaustion. Grezzk whispered something to the doctor, who shrugged and pushed her sedately forward.

Grezzk took a small pair of scissors and discretely trimmed some fur from herself and the children, twisting it into a cord that she used to bind all the donated hair and fur into a single bundle. Then she turned to face the company, speaking softly.

""We will keep this safe. For us, and for those that come after us.""

Gryzzk was fairly certain that the response to Grezzk's simple words was heard by the entirety of Homeplate."

My Answers To The People That Claim End Of Masters Kyoya Is > or = End of Masters Gingka ,BeybladeMetal,1i6dpus,2025-01-21 02:58:00,2,0.67,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeybladeMetal/comments/1i6dpus/my_answers_to_the_people_that_claim_end_of/,JmisterYT,🌀Competitive🌀,"*I Know This Is A lot But Please Read*

Now why do I say this? When gingka and kyoya’s beys evolve in the beginning of fury it looks like they’re equal on power as when there upgrades beys clash they both pass out(a mirror to there fight in masters). But i think the Ryuga fight gives a clear indication that gingka was just stronger than kyoya at the end of master/begining of fury.

When kyoya fights Ryuga it’s one kyoya that has to challenge him Ryuga tells him to go away and dismisses him but later he accepts kyoya challenge since Ryuga is Ryuga and he won’t back down from anyone. During the fight Ryuga is just playing with. There is no sign of struggle on Ryuga end aside from suprise that Leon could have this much attack power. But once ldrago is knocked into the volcano it’s like the battle completey changes Ryuga just bullies kyoya and then yells and flexes ldrago power and kyoya is knocked out 

Now let’s compare this to gingka, Ryuga is the one who initiates the challenge to gingka(now this could just be a respect thing but it’s still good to post it out) as soon as they launch it’s immediately clear that Ryuga is having to put more effort when battling gingka both are yelling in a similar manner and are knocking each of back. Ryuga is even taken back by the power pegaus holds and has worried look on his face. Then once Ryuga changes modes unlike kyoya who gets completely destroyed by the increase in attack power gingka with his mode change knocks back Ryuga and pushes him to the point where he has to use FS since Gingka was over powering him. Then it’s heavily implied that if Ryuga didn’t unleash his specials move gingka in FD would’ve Rammed right though Ryuga FS defense mode 

So when you compare both of these battle you get these points 

.Ryuya was forced to use a special move gingka but not on kyoya 

.Gingka can push back ldrago in his full offensive mode mean while kyoya could not 

.Ryuga was forced into final survive with gingka while Ryuga didn’t even feel the need to go into his full defense stance with kyoya 

.its heavily implied that final driv would sent ldrago flying if Ryuga didng use his special move to counter 

To me this proves that gingka was stronger than kyoya at the end master/ beginning of fury. If they were were truly equal gingka should’ve preformed the exact same way kyoya did and no better. But that didn’t happen which mean despite the conditions being equal(starfragment and seasonal legendary blader) the base of which these power where to increase where not the same. Basically Full Powr Galaxy >> Full Powe Rock Leon. This is the only explanation to why gingka prefomrs better than kyoya, pre starfragment there bases where not equal at all.

This to me is concert evidence againt the crowd that likes to say end of masters kyoya and was stronger or equal to end of master gingka when it’s clear this is not even the case "
ACHR: Explaining my 1.17.2025 Post In Detail - TLDR: Looking for The Bulls To Regain FULL Control - Why the next TTM Squeeze -> Fire can be the mother load!,ACHR,1i6dfdb,2025-01-21 02:35:49,39,0.85,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1i6dfdb/achr_explaining_my_1172025_post_in_detail_tldr/,Xtianus25,Bullish🚀,"Now, that 1.17.2025 is behind us and the new administration has completed the inauguration and transition back into the White House let me explain what the 1.17.2025 post and my fan made video was all about. 

Simply, it was about the Bulls accumulating more shares from a gargantuan open call options expiry. Now, it wasn't a total blow out win but it was a massively HUGE win!. Let me explain. On 1.17.2025 there were $.5 Billion options that were in the money. At various points there were probably much more than this. By the close of last Friday on the 17th there was probably a little less than this. Still, it was one of the largest concentrated call OI's I have ever seen for one particular date. 

What this means is that come market open there are people and institutions that will suddenly have many many more shares than they had on Friday. Everyone and every entity that exercised those options is now holding a lot more ACHR shares. To be clear there will be people who will sell those new shares at some point. BUT, the hope is that they won't want to or have to depending on any bullish continuation from Archer Aviation and the mountain of news we expect in the near term. 

The other thing is, like was mentioned here by NO LOSS, is that instead of taking gains now through closing the options and or selling shares in the green is that tax hit you would expect from a short term gain. This is also very important. So in all, what you hope happens is that a large influx of BULLS that are now positioned well in ACHR and not looking to sell. 

Don't get me wrong, with every wind event there is turbulence and you may see that in the interim while the true bulls take their footing. Essentially, you are looking for a new hard floor. Thanks to JP Morgan they slightly pushed the floor lower but that's ok. I think the floor could be between $6 and $9. What this means to me is anything approaching $6 plus seller exhaustion is a rush to calls and $9 or above is a watching for volume and a wait and see for news events depending on your share positioning for how you may want to play any options activity. Low volume = spreads you just have to figure out which direction you want to go. 

BUT, there is the fact that we do expect news to pick up here in a major way. For holding shares that easy but for call options you are really really wanting to see what is a good entry point that you are comfortable with before purchasing an option of any sort. The KEY to call options is calling the bottom. The KEY to put options is calling the top. Shares are forgiving options are not. So if you're not familiar or comfortable with options don't do it. Just stick with shares and keep diversified. 

For shares, the reason why buy and hold and in Jim Cramer word's own it don't trade it is so important is because it leaves out timing the tops and bottoms. Dollar cost averaging is another useful strategy because you get a relative average bottom pricing without the pain of trying to time anything. 

So how close are we to a bottom? Great question. 

Here is the latest chart and these are the most interesting things I can see from this chart. 

https://preview.redd.it/9iewddublaee1.png?width=3439&format=png&auto=webp&s=99b71a3bebd378765206a1241c5e83cdbb04dffa

The focus here are some obvious things like for one ACHR is very oversold at this point. The OBOS has completely fell below and off the charts. The OBV is trending upward but took a damn break on my super bowl 1.17.2025 days :(. But over all we are in a healthy retracement. Would hate for news to drop (seems like it already is BTW). 

The most interesting parts in this chart are the KC and Bollinger bands. What's very interesting here is that we seem to still be in the original bullish squeeze fire from November 13, 2024. No it's not a short squeeze because the shorts are still there, Albeit a little lower than before, but rather a TTM (Trade the Markets) Squeeze. What you can also see is that we had another fire scenario right around this past December 23, 2024 timeframe which worked the price up higher to the 12 month high of 12.50 I believe. But if we are tracking this 90 day 20 day chart scenario you can see that the real November fire is still in the bullish expansion. Technically, we never left the original TTM Squeeze. 

Now, what is obvious is that volume has ticked down. What we notice in this downturn is that at this stage it seems that sellers are becoming exhausted and accumulation is starting to take hold. the MOM is severely diminished but it has a pulse. The PMO is ever so slightly starting to find it's bottom. And the most positive here is that the SAR is ALMOST heading towards another bullish flip. 

None of that however, is paramount to finding a new TTM SQUEEZE -> FIRE setup like the 2'ish we have had before. 

What is a TTM SQUEEZE -> FIRE? A TTM Squeeze is when both top and bottom Bollinger bands contract inside the Keltner Channels. That's the two purple/magenta rings on the top graph with the later not technically it but had the effect nonetheless. It means a ""squeeze"" occurs by the bands thing mentioned indicating low volatility and potential breakout conditions. A TTM FIRE refers to when the Bollinger bands expand out of the KC bands signaling the end of the squeeze and the start of a significant price move (breakout or breakdown). 

In short: Squeeze and then POP. Again, this doesn't mean a short squeeze nor is it really related. 

So from what I see in the chart, recent price activity, and how the fundamentals of the KC / Bollinger bands work this would be what I would expect. Meaning, how would we get a potential TTM Squeeze -> Fire setup  from this point forward. 

A. the KC bands would need to show a sharp decline by over taking and engulfing the Bollinger bands specifically the higher to higher and lower to lower i.e. fully engulfed. The Bollinger is based on standard deviations of the price and is more sensitive to overall price movements and in general likes to see less volatility. Whereas, the KC channels are more sensitive to intraday and general price range movements and in general likes to see more price volatility. Seeing a sharp decline in price is not how I would like to see the KC channel engulf the Bollinger bands. Nor, would I expect this with the recent price declines. 

B. The price action would need to become less volatile and recapture the Standard Deviation so that it is lessened dramatically. This can be achieved with relatively flat price action and thus further contracting the Bollinger bands more meaningfully. This is more likely and what you would expect is further contraction by that lower Bollinger band coming towards it's MA of $9.78. 

The risk here is no longer on the Bulls but is rather squarely on the Bears. They have to be very careful here. Nobody selling means more buyers can come in an accumulate shares strengthening the bull base. And, impending news can only serve as a drastic catalyst to the upside. In short, the bears/shorts are fighting against time. If people / entities aren't selling then the risk to them grows each and every day. If that lower Bollinger band contracts significantly and is engulfed by the lower KC channel then we could have a squeeze and fire all over. Depending on what news comes to serve that best is debatable but for me it would be 1. piloted flight and 2. any more large deals with international entities. 

Again, the SAR speaks to exactly this exactly as it is about to flip. Another danger for the shorts that is related to time is that they have an inherent built in time to value decay similar to options. the more you are losing no matter how cheap the short borrowed shares are the more one risks locking in more loss over the course of time. Meaning, are you going to wait until Midnights are flying 1000's of people before you decide to exit your shorts? At some point the risk and losses become to great to Bear <- see what i did there. 

It's probably why your not seeing powerful shorting in the dark pool at this level of volume. Somewhere in that short bag holder ledger there are short sellers that are thinking don't lower the price too much or Cathie Wood might decide to LOAD UP again. What they are probably hoping for is more of a black swan event or something they perceive as a market risk to Archer and Joby or just an opportunity to quietly get out of as much institutional shorts as they can and leave the retail traders holding the short-bag that are shorting the stock but probably not reading this post or paying attention to any real market conditions or dynamics of the company. Pigs get slaughtered on the way up and on the way down... Especially on the way  down because news and or events can come at any moment. 

Instead, what the short sellers are desperately afraid of now is volume returning at this stage. Admittedly it is also what I am most concerned with as well. If we Bulls don't see volume then we know we are either consolidating or losing share price. 

The perfect setup would be drips of some news. More consolidation... More accumulation... Even more accumulation and then BOOM piloted flight, earnings... Anything noteworthy and positive. These price levels are critical over the next 2 weeks. If we can go flat or slightly up and accumulate more and more buyers the next potential fire could be the really really big one. At $12 - $16 I can't imagine the older shorts maintaining such a position without significant losses. This too puts more risk on the newer shorts to exit their positions quickly and give way to an even more significant real short squeeze / and or gamma squeeze. 

In the end 1.17.2025 wasn't necessarily wrong ;) - It just may have been a few days early! To the short sellers beware - Don't let the OX/institutional short seller dark pools rug pull you. You can't get out early if you want to. "
GPT reply to trump’s coin future,antiwork,1i64ji0,2025-01-20 18:31:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1i64ji0/gpt_reply_to_trumps_coin_future/,Witty_alexa,Discussion Post 🗣,"
January 2025 was when it began—when the world tipped over into darkness disguised as progress. It wasn’t a war, a virus, or even an economic collapse. It was a meme coin.

Donald Trump, days before his return to the presidency, unveiled the $TRUMP coin, calling it “America’s currency for the future.” Initially dismissed as a vanity project, the coin gained momentum through Trump’s cult-like following. It was marketed as a way to “take back power from the elites,” and for many, it felt like the first step toward economic freedom. But freedom is a funny word—it’s only real until someone redefines it.

Within weeks, the $TRUMP coin became the fastest-adopted cryptocurrency in history. The administration leaned into its success, announcing that all federal payments would soon be made in $TRUMP. The value of the coin skyrocketed. People scrambled to convert their savings, sell their assets, and buy into what was being called “the revolution.” Banks, already struggling with declining trust, began collapsing as fiat currencies lost relevance. The dollar wasn’t just dead; it was erased.

But $TRUMP wasn’t just a coin. Its blockchain wasn’t just a ledger. It was a web—a network of surveillance so intricate that it saw not just your transactions but your life. Every wallet required identity verification, including biometric data. Every purchase was tracked, categorized, and analyzed. On the surface, it was about “transparency and trust.” In reality, it was about control.

By mid-2025, $TRUMP wasn’t just a currency—it was the backbone of society. Businesses that refused to accept it were blacklisted. Schools required students to pay tuition in $TRUMP. Even charitable donations had to pass through the coin’s blockchain, where the government decided which causes were “worthy.” A parallel social score system, called the “Patriot Index,” was quietly introduced. The score determined your access to healthcare, housing, and even internet bandwidth. Those who spoke out against the system saw their scores drop. Protests were met not with arrests but with digital erasure—wallets frozen, identities wiped. You didn’t just lose your voice; you lost your existence.

Globally, chaos erupted. Other nations tried to ban $TRUMP, fearing its spread, but it was too late. The coin’s adoption forced the world to bend. Economies were fractured as the U.S. refused to trade with any country not onboard with $TRUMP. Alliances dissolved. Wars broke out—not over resources, but over control of the blockchain infrastructure. In one chilling address, Trump called it “the ultimate weapon.” He wasn’t wrong.

By 2027, the U.S. was unrecognizable. What was once a democracy became a corporate autocracy, with the Trump Organization at its helm. Congress was dissolved in favor of “blockchain voting,” where only high-scoring Patriots could participate. Military funding skyrocketed as dissenters were labeled “cyberterrorists” and hunted down. Every citizen’s wallet displayed not just their balance but their loyalty score, visible to anyone. Neighbors turned on each other. Parents disowned children. Survival meant silence, compliance, and constant self-surveillance.

And Trump? He didn’t need rallies anymore. He didn’t need votes. The blockchain was his podium, and through it, he spoke to every corner of the world—his words unavoidable, his face inescapable. The $TRUMP coin wasn’t just currency; it was the foundation of a new feudalism, where the peasants were digital slaves, and the king ruled unchallenged.

But there were whispers of rebellion. In the shadows of the deep web, a movement began. Hackers, exiles, and the disenfranchised formed a coalition to destroy the $TRUMP blockchain. They called themselves “Null.” Their mission wasn’t just to dismantle the system but to expose the horrifying truth: the coin was a Trojan horse, co-developed with rogue tech giants and foreign adversaries. It wasn’t about freedom. It was about consolidation—a global reset, where power was transferred from governments to corporations, and then to one man.

Null’s work was dangerous. The blockchain’s AI defenses hunted them relentlessly. Members disappeared—some arrested, some erased, some… worse. But Null pressed on, building an offline network of resistance. They began publishing fragments of the truth, leaking evidence that the Patriot Index wasn’t just monitoring citizens; it was rewriting them. Memories, histories, even DNA records were being altered in real time. Humanity was no longer just controlled—it was being rewritten.

By 2030, the resistance had reached a critical point. Null discovered a flaw in the blockchain’s architecture, a single line of code that could trigger a collapse. But the cost would be unimaginable. The collapse would wipe out every wallet, every score, and every identity tied to the system. Society would be plunged into chaos. Yet Null believed it was a risk worth taking.

The night of the collapse was apocalyptic. As the blockchain unraveled, cities plunged into darkness. People panicked as their digital lives disappeared in an instant. Governments, already weakened, fell apart. The world was thrown into a new kind of dystopia—not one ruled by control, but by anarchy.

And Trump? He vanished. Some say he fled to a private island, others believe he uploaded himself into the very AI that once powered $TRUMP. His face became a ghost, a memory burned into the ruins of a society that had been promised freedom but delivered only chains.

The $TRUMP coin was gone, but the scars it left behind would last for generations. In the end, it wasn’t just a meme coin. It was a mirror, reflecting humanity’s greed, complacency, and blind faith in progress.

And in that reflection, we saw the end of the world as we knew it.

In light of recent events his people had begun thinking of him as a guardian, a symbol. Slowly but surely he was beginning to like it. Since ascending he had begun to recognise the perks of being the God of Freedom, such as powers over connections. He decided to start the journey slow, he taught how to make and break physical bonds, mostly to repair broken tools.*

*He wouldn't teach how to break or form mental bonds however. After all he's always had a burning hatred of mental magic, altering the minds of others disgusted him.*

""Focus on your freedom, your detachments. Channel that freedom into the outside world like so.""

*With a flick of the wrist all the branches, leaves, and roots of a nearby tree fell apart. The fragments scattered around it's trunk, leaving a giant stick jutting from the ground, toppling over shortly after. The people did the same, Alaric felt the power flow from him to them. He saw varying results, including a trimming of the grass, a rock splitting in half, and someone's shirt loosing its sleeves.*

""Okay, good results. Continue to practice for a few hours.""

*He set off to leave, then paused.*

""Oh and quick thing, I will feel it every time you try. Do with that what you will.""

*After giving the final message, Alaric leaves to check on Freetown's newest arrival. He found the Astral Elf wearing recently cleaned silk robes on the edge of the town, putting some kind of enchantment on the boarder.*

""Mormon. How goes your time here?""

""Pretty good, people are nice. I'm happy money doesn't exist here, this place will stay off the radar, at least for a while.""

""Is that what you're doing? Making sure this place stays off the radar?""

""Ha, not exactly. I'm making sure the people inside the town's borders have good dreams. My way of saying thanks for having me.""

""I'm thankful, you don't need to but I'm thankful.""

""It may have side effects, honestly I'm not sure the spell even works, first time I've tried this one.""

*Suddenly Alaric spots something in the distance, there's movement where he massacred a slave auction a few days ago.*

""I'm sure it'll be fine. I have to go, nice chatting though.""

*With that, Alaric was off to investigate. Disguising himself as a raven once more he flew over to the site. Twelve or so humans milled about, piecing together what happened.*

""Okay! Let's avoid this area in the future yeah?""

""Gary spitting facts. I don't feel like getting cooked. You feel like getting cooked?""

""Nope.""

""Okay, I say we leave, head back to the boss, and get off early today. Who's with me?""

*Eleven voices sounded in agreement. Alaric watched as one elderly human in a big hat stuck some strange dance moves, opening a portal in the process. He saw the twelve humans walk through, and flew in after them. When he emerged on the other side he saw a huge mansion, caravans traveling in and out of a door in the floor, probably leading to a dungeon. As was to be expected, some rich person was heading the operation.*

*He flew up to get a good view of the place. One big mansion, an arsenal of caravans, one road in and out. The beginnings of a plan was forming in his mind. He flew through an open window in the attic, no one there. He changed form into an ant, then looked for the rich person who owned the place.*

*Eventually he found a very fancy office with a very well dressed noblewoman and the same twelve people as before. He heard them give a report on what happened, then he heard the noble let eleven of them leave, the twelfth she gave the order to go to her chambers in a few hours, once the sun went down. The more important thing was Alaric saw a ledger, conveniently with the number of people involved written in it. Who knew what other secret It held, the buyers names and delivery locations by chance? He needed to acquire it. Then, he'd deal with the people here.*

*A few hours went by, Alaric took the ledger, stashed it in a rift, then did something devious. Using his incredible shapeshifting ability he mimiced the bosses voice perfectly, no one even questioned the order for all employees and assets to be brought to HQ. Which just so happened to be the mansion. Then, silent as a shadow, he cast a binding spell around the site, preventing anyone from leaving. After all what is imprisonment if not the absence of freedom? He could give it, and he could take it away.*

*Now all he had to do was deal with the people here. The ledger counted 380 employees, and 873 'assets'. He knew exactly how he'd execute his plan. The question was, how would he execute the slavers? Alaric is a  creative creature. There are a lot of slavers. Why not have some fun?*"

Why Investing in Quality Accounting Services is Crucial for Your Business,u_theonlineforyou,1i5t1kl,2025-01-20 10:43:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1i5t1kl/why_investing_in_quality_accounting_services_is/,theonlineforyou,,"Running a successful business requires a careful balance of many moving parts: managing operations, leading teams, delivering value to customers, and, of course, keeping your finances in check. While business owners often focus on product development, marketing strategies, and customer acquisition, one critical aspect can sometimes be overlooked—accounting.

Accounting services might seem like a back-office task, but they are the foundation of your financial health and long-term growth. From tax compliance to financial planning, budgeting, and cash flow management, quality accounting services play a pivotal role in ensuring your business thrives and scales effectively.

In this article, we will explore why investing in high-quality accounting services is crucial for your business. We'll look at the numerous benefits, key considerations, and how expert accounting can drive profitability and protect you from potential pitfalls.

# 1. The Importance of Accounting Services in Business

In the early stages of a business, you might feel that accounting services are unnecessary or a luxury you can’t afford. However, this is a misconception that can lead to significant challenges down the road. Accounting is more than just tracking your income and expenses—it is the language of business. Proper accounting helps you understand your financial position, make informed decisions, and strategize for the future.

A skilled accountant provides insights into every financial aspect of your business, from the health of your cash flow to the most profitable areas of your operations. As your business grows, the complexity of your finances also increases, and having a professional team by your side ensures you don’t miss key opportunities or fall victim to costly mistakes.

By investing in quality accounting services, you gain a proactive approach to managing your business's finances. This can ultimately help you avoid financial pitfalls and allow you to focus on what you do best—running your business.

# 2. How Accounting Services Help with Tax Compliance

Tax compliance is a significant concern for any business owner. With ever-changing tax laws, regulations, and deadlines, it can be difficult to keep up. Many business owners make the mistake of handling their taxes on their own, only to find that they’ve missed deductions, overpaid, or failed to comply with regulations.

Accountants are experts in navigating tax codes and ensuring compliance with federal, state, and local tax laws. They stay updated on tax changes and can help you minimize your tax liabilities while maximizing deductions and credits. Furthermore, accountants will ensure that all tax filings are completed accurately and on time, avoiding penalties, fines, and unnecessary audits.

Whether you are a small business or a larger enterprise, having an accountant who understands tax compliance is essential for staying on top of your responsibilities and making the most of available tax benefits. When your taxes are handled by a professional, you can have peace of mind knowing that everything is done correctly.

# 3. Understanding the Role of Accountants in Financial Planning

Financial planning is an ongoing process that helps your business set clear goals, manage risks, and make strategic decisions about its future. Accountants play a crucial role in this area by providing the data and insights necessary to inform sound financial planning.

Through financial statements, cash flow projections, and analysis of past financial performance, accountants help you understand where your business stands financially. They assist in budgeting for future expenses, investing in growth opportunities, and managing capital effectively. They can even offer advice on how to allocate resources, reduce costs, and increase profitability.

A well-thought-out financial plan helps you anticipate challenges and ensures that you are prepared for both opportunities and setbacks. It’s not just about surviving the next quarter—it’s about planning for long-term sustainability. Having a professional accountant on your team provides invaluable expertise in shaping a financially sound roadmap for your business's success.

# 4. Cash Flow Management: Why It Matters

Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business. Without sufficient cash flow, your business cannot pay its employees, suppliers, or meet other critical operational costs. Effective cash flow management ensures that you have enough liquidity to keep operations running smoothly and invest in opportunities for growth.

Accounting services help by providing real-time insights into your cash inflows and outflows, identifying potential shortfalls before they become a crisis. By accurately forecasting cash flow needs, accountants can help you avoid late payments, missed opportunities, and the need for last-minute loans. They can also help you manage accounts receivable and payable, improving collection efforts and reducing the strain on your finances.

A well-managed cash flow strategy allows you to focus on the more strategic aspects of growing your business, rather than constantly worrying about paying bills or meeting payroll. Quality accounting services can keep your cash flow steady, so you never find yourself caught off guard.

# 5. Financial Reporting and How It Helps Your Business

Financial reporting is another critical area where quality accounting services can make a difference. Regular and accurate financial reports give you a clear picture of how your business is performing. These reports include balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements—each of which tells a different story about your business’s financial health.

With timely financial reporting, you can track revenue, expenses, profitability, and assets over time, giving you the data you need to make informed decisions. Financial reports can also be used to analyze trends, identify potential problem areas, and make adjustments to improve your business’s financial performance.

Beyond internal use, these reports are also important for external stakeholders such as investors, lenders, and potential partners. If you’re seeking funding or planning to expand your business, having accurate and detailed financial reports on hand will be critical in building trust and demonstrating your company’s viability.

# 6. Budgeting and Forecasting: Preparing for the Future

One of the most important roles of an accountant is to help businesses create and maintain a budget. Budgets are essential for setting financial goals, allocating resources, and ensuring that the business doesn’t overspend. A budget isn’t just a number on a piece of paper—it is a powerful tool that helps you track your financial performance and guides your decision-making.

Accountants work with business owners to create a realistic and practical budget based on historical data and future projections. They can also help with cash flow forecasting, which involves predicting future income and expenses over a set period. This allows you to plan for any potential shortfalls in advance and avoid financial surprises.

Accurate budgeting and forecasting also give you the ability to make informed decisions about investments, hiring, and other business activities. By understanding your financial limits, you can allocate funds to the areas that will provide the highest return on investment. In addition, regular monitoring of your budget will help you stay on track, adjusting your spending and plans as needed to ensure that you meet your financial targets.

In essence, budgeting and forecasting help you avoid the chaos of financial uncertainty and give you a clear path forward, especially when navigating periods of growth or economic fluctuations.

# 7. Protecting Your Business from Financial Fraud and Errors

While the prospect of financial fraud is often associated with large corporations, small and medium-sized businesses are just as vulnerable—if not more so. Fraud, theft, and financial errors can have devastating consequences, both financially and reputationally. That’s where quality accounting services come into play.

Accountants implement internal controls to prevent fraud and ensure that all transactions are accurate and legitimate. This includes creating policies for handling payments, managing access to financial information, and performing regular reconciliations. They also monitor for any discrepancies in financial records and can quickly spot any signs of potential fraud or embezzlement.

Moreover, accountants help businesses avoid costly errors in their financial reporting. Simple mistakes, like misclassified expenses or missed deductions, can result in significant financial losses and legal consequences. By hiring professional accounting services, you reduce the risk of making costly errors, ensuring that your financial records are always accurate and in compliance with regulations.

Protecting your business from fraud and errors is crucial for maintaining trust with stakeholders, ensuring long-term profitability, and safeguarding your business’s reputation. Accounting services offer peace of mind by identifying and preventing these risks before they turn into serious problems.

# 8. Outsourcing Accounting vs. In-House Accounting: Which is Best for Your Business?

As your business grows, the decision between outsourcing accounting services or hiring an in-house accounting team becomes a crucial one. Both options have their merits, but each comes with its own set of challenges.

**Outsourcing accounting services** offers several benefits, such as cost savings, access to a team of professionals, and the ability to scale your accounting efforts without increasing overhead. With outsourcing, you only pay for the services you need, and you can tap into the expertise of accountants who specialize in different areas of finance. Outsourcing also frees you from the burden of managing an internal team and allows you to focus on your core business activities.

On the other hand, **in-house accounting** can provide more control over the accounting process and may be beneficial if your business requires more personalized, day-to-day financial management. Having an in-house team can foster closer communication and alignment with your company’s goals, as well as enable more immediate access to financial data.

Ultimately, the choice between outsourcing and in-house accounting depends on the size of your business, your specific needs, and your financial goals. Smaller businesses or those with more straightforward financial needs might benefit from outsourcing, while larger companies or those with complex financial structures may prefer the control and consistency of in-house accounting.

# 9. How Accounting Services Support Business Growth and Scalability

Every business dreams of growing and expanding, but sustainable growth requires careful financial planning and management. That’s where professional accounting services come into play. As your business grows, so do the complexities of your finances. Accounting services ensure that your business remains financially healthy, even as you scale up operations.

Accountants help you manage multiple revenue streams, handle new expenses, and navigate the challenges that come with growth, such as scaling operations, hiring new employees, and investing in new technologies. They also assist in securing funding for expansion, whether through loans, grants, or private investors, by preparing detailed financial reports and projections that demonstrate your business’s potential.

In addition, accountants help you identify areas where you can increase efficiency or profitability. For instance, they can advise you on cost-cutting measures, optimizing pricing strategies, and improving operational processes. By working with a professional accounting service, you ensure that your business has the financial infrastructure it needs to scale effectively and sustainably.

Quality accounting services are a key enabler of growth. They provide the financial insights, strategic planning, and operational guidance necessary to take your business to the next level.

# 10. How to Choose the Right Accounting Firm for Your Business

Choosing the right accounting firm is one of the most important decisions you’ll make as a business owner. The right accountant will not only keep your finances in check but will also be a trusted advisor who helps you navigate complex financial situations and grow your business.

When evaluating potential accounting firms, consider the following factors:

* **Experience and Expertise**: Does the firm have experience working with businesses in your industry? Are they knowledgeable about your specific needs, whether it’s tax planning, auditing, or financial forecasting?
* **Reputation**: What do other business owners say about their services? Check for online reviews, references, and any industry awards or certifications that demonstrate their credibility.
* **Range of Services**: Does the accounting firm offer a comprehensive suite of services, from bookkeeping to tax planning and financial consulting? A firm with a broad range of services can adapt to your changing needs as your business evolves.
* **Technology**: Does the accounting firm use modern software and technologies to streamline financial processes? Look for firms that are comfortable with cloud-based accounting platforms, as these can improve efficiency and data security.
* **Communication**: Does the firm offer transparent communication and accessible support? You should be able to easily reach your accountant and have your questions answered promptly.

Taking the time to select the right accounting firm is essential for your business’s long-term success. The right partnership can provide you with financial clarity, strategic insights, and the confidence to make decisions that drive growth.

# 11. The Role of Technology in Modern Accounting Services

In today’s fast-paced business world, technology plays a pivotal role in streamlining accounting processes, enhancing accuracy, and improving efficiency. The days of relying solely on manual ledger entries, calculators, and paper-based processes are long gone. With the rise of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and sophisticated financial software, modern accounting has become much more advanced and accessible.

By leveraging the latest accounting technologies, businesses can track financial transactions in real-time, automate routine processes, and improve the accuracy of their financial data. For example, cloud-based accounting software allows business owners to access financial reports and data anytime, anywhere, making it easier to manage your finances from any device. This accessibility is particularly important for small business owners who may be juggling multiple responsibilities.

Additionally, many accounting services now incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to automate complex tasks like data entry, invoice matching, and expense categorization. AI can also analyze historical financial data to predict trends and offer insights that can inform future decisions. With this level of technology integration, accounting services are not just about tracking what’s already happened—they can provide forward-looking advice that helps businesses stay ahead of the competition.

Moreover, technology improves security. Online financial platforms are equipped with multiple layers of encryption and security protocols to protect sensitive data. By using modern accounting services that rely on secure technologies, businesses can rest assured that their financial information is safe from cyber threats.

# 12. How Proper Accounting Helps with Securing Funding

When seeking investment or financing for your business, the first thing that lenders or investors will ask for is your financial information. Proper accounting plays a critical role in helping you secure funding, as accurate and well-organized financial records are essential to proving your business’s credibility and potential for growth.

Whether you’re applying for a bank loan, approaching angel investors, or seeking venture capital, your financial statements, tax returns, and projections will be scrutinized. Having a professional accountant prepare these documents ensures they are clear, accurate, and reflect the true state of your business. Well-prepared financial reports provide potential investors with the confidence that you understand your business’s financials and have a solid plan for the future.

Moreover, accounting services help you create financial forecasts and cash flow projections that are vital when seeking funding. Lenders and investors want to know that your business can repay loans or generate a return on their investment. With accurate forecasting, accountants demonstrate how you plan to manage funds and ensure that your business remains profitable.

In essence, proper accounting makes your business appear more attractive to potential financiers. It shows that you have a well-organized, transparent financial operation and increases the likelihood of securing the funding you need to grow and expand your business.

# 13. Improving Business Decision-Making Through Financial Insights

Good business decisions are based on data—and that data often comes from your financial reports. Accounting services not only help you keep track of your numbers, but they also provide valuable insights that drive smarter decision-making. A solid understanding of your financial position can guide you in making important choices related to pricing, investments, hiring, and expansion.

For example, accountants can provide you with cost analysis reports to help you identify inefficiencies or areas where you might be overspending. They can also track profitability by product line or department, allowing you to focus on the areas of your business that generate the most revenue. In addition, financial analysis helps you assess the potential risks and rewards of business decisions, such as launching a new product or entering a new market.

By working with an accountant, you can receive actionable advice that improves your business’s financial health. Instead of making gut decisions based on intuition or incomplete information, you’ll have accurate, data-driven insights that lead to better outcomes.

Having access to financial insights gives you a competitive edge. You’ll be able to forecast challenges, seize opportunities, and make decisions that will drive sustainable growth. Whether it’s managing resources more efficiently or capitalizing on emerging trends, accounting services provide the clarity and support you need to make the right choices.

# 14. The Legal and Regulatory Importance of Accounting Services

In any business, staying compliant with legal and regulatory requirements is essential for avoiding fines, penalties, and potential legal issues. Proper accounting ensures that your business adheres to all applicable laws, from tax filings and payroll requirements to industry-specific regulations.

Accountants help businesses understand the legal and regulatory framework in which they operate. They assist with tax planning to ensure that your business is in compliance with local, state, and federal tax laws. They also help with payroll compliance, ensuring that employees’ wages are reported correctly and that taxes are withheld appropriately.

Moreover, accounting services help you stay up-to-date with any changes to tax laws, accounting standards, or industry regulations. Tax codes, financial reporting rules, and business regulations can change frequently, and an accountant ensures that you are always operating within the boundaries of the law.

Failure to comply with financial regulations can result in audits, legal actions, and fines that can severely harm your business’s reputation and profitability. By investing in quality accounting services, you ensure that your business remains legally compliant and avoids costly mistakes that could put your operations at risk.

# 15. Conclusion: Why Quality Accounting Services Are an Investment, Not an Expense

Investing in quality accounting services is one of the smartest decisions a business owner can make. While many entrepreneurs might view accounting as an optional expense, the truth is that it is a long-term investment in the health and success of your business. Quality accounting services provide you with the financial expertise, tools, and strategies necessary to manage your finances effectively, optimize profitability, and scale your business for future growth.

Whether it’s tax planning, budgeting, forecasting, or ensuring compliance with legal regulations, accounting services are crucial for maintaining financial stability and preventing costly errors. Additionally, accountants provide valuable insights that support informed decision-making and guide you toward sustainable business practices.

The role of accounting services goes beyond number-crunching. They act as financial advisors, helping you manage risk, secure funding, protect your assets, and grow your business over time. With the right accounting partner, you can confidently navigate the complexities of finance, make smarter decisions, and position your business for long-term success.

Quality accounting services are not just a cost—they are a vital investment that pays dividends in the form of financial clarity, improved business performance, and a stronger foundation for future growth."

# PROGRESS

*Kura wanders around a classroom, observing the students sitting in front copying what’s on the blackboard while the teacher went to the bathroom.*

**Kura:** *""This place seems depressing.""* *She comments in a melancholic tone.*

*Kura hears a commotion at the back of the room and walks over. In that corner, no one is copying from the blackboard. Instead, they’re talking nonstop, including Gutsu, who seems to be very sleepy.*

**Miyuki:** *""I-I’m serious! Gutsu stole more than 10,000 yen from me! Y-you have to believe me!""* *Miyuki says, desperate for someone to believe her story.*

**Isao:** *""Give it a break, Miyuki! Who’s going to believe you? You don’t even have any evidence!""* *Isao retorts, lightly pushing the girl back.*

*The students at the back laugh at Miyuki's story.*

**Gutsu:** *""This just sounds like a failed attempt to get 10,000 yen for free, Miyu. Why would I steal from you in the first place?""* *He says, laughing. Inside, he just wants to annoy Miyuki even more.*

*Gutsu and Miyuki stare at each other. She clearly looks furious, while he just smiles.*

*At lunchtime, Gutsu sits on the grass, as far away from the other students as possible. He has the Life Ledger on his lap and a mini LCD TV next to him. Kura watches Gutsu from above, noticing the bags starting to form under his eyes.*

**Kura:** *""You look tired.""*

**Gutsu:** *""Well, can you blame me for filling my nights so full?""*

**Kura:** *""What did you do last night?""*

*Gutsu looks at Kura, surprised.* **Gutsu:** *""You don’t remember? I told you my plans.""*

**Kura:** *""I guess I didn’t pay much attention.""*

*Gutsu takes a sip from his energy drink before continuing.*

**Gutsu:** *""Last night I studied how Kira kills.""*

**Kura:** *""Didn’t you say he was killing criminals?""*

**Gutsu:** *""Yeah, but we have to look at HOW and WHEN he kills, instead of just WHO. Nowadays, he's killing criminals minutes after they're shown on the news.""*

**Kura:** *""So that’s why you brought this mini TV.""*

**Gutsu:** *""Exactly. But I noticed something while I was studying yesterday. When Kira started, the times of the killings were different. Based on that, it’s very likely that he’s a student. However, later, the times changed, which makes me think he learned to control when people die.""*

**Kura:** *""Not a bad hypothesis. What are you going to do now?""*

*Gutsu looks at his mini TV, where faces and names of newly arrested criminals begin to appear. He starts writing in the Life Ledger.*

**Gutsu:** *""I’m going to save the criminals as soon as they appear on the news today. After all, I don’t need to write before Kira, just within 20 seconds after him. This will also be an experiment to see if the Life Ledger works when I write before Kira. I think it will.""*

**Kura:** *""But how is saving these criminals going to help?""*

**Gutsu:** *""To confuse L. Kira kills every day, so it’d be odd if criminals stopped dying on random days. L probably already has suspects. I’m doing this to make him question, change his suspects, and, with some luck, arrest the wrong person. Haha! Wouldn’t that be funny?""*

**Kura:** *""I don’t see the humor in someone being falsely accused of murder.""* *She says, in a neutral tone.*

**Gutsu:** *""Wow, you’re really no fun, huh? Go enjoy yourself.""* *He replies, pretending to be irritated, but with a smile.*

*The TV announces more names of criminals, and Gutsu resumes writing.*

***Gutsu: ""This is going to be great. L will definitely wonder why no criminals died today. I’ll make sure to be unpredictable: saving criminals at irregular intervals, between one and five days, to overload L with information. Let’s see how he handles this.""***

*Kura looks around the school yard. She sees Miyuki in the distance, glaring at Gutsu. Kura looks back at him.*

***Kura: ""This kid... Is he naïve or just carefree?""***

***Gutsu: ""Now that I think about it... why did Kira decide to change the timing of the killings? Does he know that L is suspecting him? It's a possibility...""***

**Teito Hotel, Room 487. 11:40 PM**

*Watari enters the room, this time without any papers in hand.*

**Watari:** *""Ryuzaki. According to the news, none of the criminals shown publicly were killed today.""*

*Soichiro, sitting next to L, stands up, surprised.*

**Soichiro:** *""No criminals died today? Are you sure, Watari?""*

**Watari:** *""I’m sure, Mr. Yagami.""*

**Soichiro:** *""But that doesn’t make sense. Why would Kira stop killing today?""*

***L: ""Great question. It wouldn’t make sense for Kira to stop killing today, unless something happened. Light watched the news today... Could he have decided to take a break? Unlikely. Or maybe he’s trying to prove his innocence? But that would mean Light knows we’re watching him, and he never rearranged his room or looked at the cameras...""***

**L:** *""Better not to jump to conclusions. Let’s wait a few days to gather more information.""*

**8 DAYS LATER**

**L:** *""In the last few days, I’ve reviewed all our audio and video recordings. I’ve done this countless times. The recordings from the Kitamura and Yagami houses revealed... nothing.""* *L speaks as he opens a piece of candy and puts it in his mouth.*

*Soichiro sighs in relief.*

**L:** *""Let’s remove all the cameras and bugs.""* *He chews.*

**L:** *""The criminals stopped dying regardless of whether the Kitamuras or Yagamis watched the news. And the days were random. I compared them with important dates for the suspects, but nothing matched. It doesn’t make sense, since this doesn’t benefit Kira.""*

*L takes a sip of his coffee.*

***L: ""This doesn’t make any sense. It almost makes me think Kira is just a vengeful god, but, well, it’s ridiculous to think that gods need a name and face to kill, and even more absurd to think that they can 'fail' at it. It’s obvious Kira is just someone with a god complex.""***

*L places the cup on the table.*

***L: ""Kira wasn’t having problems killing criminals before, but something changed. Maybe his powers or even another person in his way...""***

**L:** *""Alright, from now on, I want recordings from the cameras in the prisons around the Kanto region.""*

*L looks at Soichiro.*

**L:** *""Can you arrange that, Soichiro Yagami?""*

*Soichiro, surprised, clears his throat before speaking.*

**Soichiro:** *""Ah, yes, Ryuzaki, I can handle that.""*

**L:** *""Great. I want to monitor Kira's actions in real-time...""*

*Gutsu sits on the bed, twirling a pen between his fingers while eating chips. He looks frustrated. Kura is floating in the air, eating grapes that Gutsu had given her. She watches him with a neutral expression.*

**Kura:** *""Something wrong?""*

*Gutsu sighs, closing his eyes.*

**Gutsu:** *""I don’t know what to do. I need to find Kira and L... Only then will I know how to act.""*

*He chews the chip, staring into space.*

**Gutsu:** *""But how? They both must be extremely cautious. I’ve researched a lot, but I haven’t found anything on L. I discovered some suspects for being Kira, but there’s nothing confirming it. It’s not like I can just investigate and question people out of nowhere. And even if I find Kira, all he has to do is write my name in the Death Note, and I’ll die.""*

*Kura grabs another grape without changing her expression.*

**Kura:** *""But you can write your own name in the Life Ledger.""*

**Gutsu:** *""Yeah, but then Kira will realize something’s off and never trust me.""*

*Gutsu lies down on the bed, staring at the ceiling with a defeated look on his face.*

**Gutsu:** *""Trust... That’s all I need.""*

*The silence fills the room. The only sound is the bag of chips.*

**Kura:** *""Do you know why we shinigamis kill humans?""*

*Gutsu stays silent for a moment before looking at her.*

**Gutsu:** *""Why?""*

**Kura:** *""Because we’re afraid of dying. When we kill a human, the remaining lifespan of that person is added to our own time. But that doesn’t work when a human kills another using a Death Note.""* *She speaks in a more melancholic tone now.*

**Gutsu:** *""And... what’s your point?""*

**Kura:** *""I can give you shinigami eyes, Gutsu.""*

*Gutsu’s eyes widen for a moment as he sits up in bed.*

**Gutsu:** *""Shinigami eyes?""*

**Kura:** *""Our eyes are different. I can see not only your name, but also the remaining time of life floating above your head. You can have them too, if you want.""*

**Gutsu:** *""I... don’t see how this will help me.""*

**Kura:** *""With shinigami eyes, there are only two situations in which you cannot see someone’s remaining time: your own, and the time of other humans who possess a Death Note.""*

*Gutsu’s eyes widen for a moment.*

**Gutsu:** *""I-Is that serious? I can... tell who has a Death Note just by looking at them?""*

**Kura:** *""Yes. But there’s a price... Normally, I would charge more, but... you intrigue me.""*

**Gutsu:** *""What’s the price?""*

**Kura:** *""Give me 40% of your remaining lifespan, and the shinigami eyes will be yours. Deal?""*

*Gutsu stares at Kura for almost a minute... then, he smiles.*

**Gutsu:** *""I’d even let you charge the full price, Kura... Haha!""*

*He laughs, standing up from the bed.*

**Gutsu:** *""I have no reason to want to live long in this shitty world. If I can gain an advantage and end this faster, it’s like killing two birds with one stone!""*

*He laughs again.*

**Gutsu:** *""Let’s go, Kura. I accept!""*

*Kura remains silent, though internally, she’s surprised.*

**Kura:** *""...You accept your death so easily... But will you accept what comes before it?""*

*Gutsu doesn’t respond; he just laughs. For the first time, Kura feels curiosity and intrigue for a human.*

**Kura:** *""...You’re interesting...""*

**Gutsu:** *""And you’ll see something even more interesting! I promise you that!""*

X

**Yume Road, 33**

*Light walks back home with a shopping bag. Earlier, he watched the news, memorizing the names and faces of criminals. Now, away from L’s cameras, he begins writing the names in the Death Note. Ryuk flies beside him.*

*While writing, something catches his attention. The same criminal was shown both yesterday and today on the news. Light notices this because the name of this criminal was already written in the notebook.*

***Light: ""What?! If the name was already written, this criminal should’ve died from a heart attack! I didn’t write wrong. It’s exactly the same as what was shown on the news. What’s going on?""***

*Light thinks for a moment.*

**Light:** *""Ryuk, is there any way to avoid being killed by the Death Note?""*

**Ryuk:** *""Look, Light, even we shinigamis don’t know everything the notebook can or can’t do. But I think as long as you write the right name and have the person’s face in mind, the death is guaranteed. I’ve never seen any human escape the Death Note.""*

*Light sighs, frustrated.*

**Ryuk:** *""Hehehe! Don’t tell me you couldn’t kill someone?""*

**Light:** *""L can’t be doing this... It’s impossible and makes no sense. Could there be some other rule or detail about the Death Note I don’t know? Or is it something beyond that?""*

*Light reflects for a few more moments.*

**Light:** *""Anyway, this can wait. I’ve got more important matters to solve now.""*

***Light: ""I can’t let this throw me off... Maybe it’s a test from L. Somehow.""***"

# Kody (Johnson)

He's 22 years old, works as an assassin, lives with a dragon (Orthus) and has already had a pretty convoluted life.

Born as the 3rd son to a noble family in the New Erigian Empire, he had little chance of properly inheriting the family title. His family are so-called rogue assassins, going against the designs of The Coalition (the joined leadership of Assassins and Rangers), and got their noble title by betraying the Coalition.

After 2 sons, they wanted a daughter, with plans of having her be a strong magic user, so they prepared by consuming large amounts of magic potions before trying for their 3rd kid. When it turned out they were twins, the decision was made. Jane, Kody's twin sister, was raised as a powerful time magic user, her name even following the family naming tradition (all J-names), while Kody was forbidden from learning into his own (space magic). Instead, his training focused on the physical, and due to him being a surprise, it was especially demanding.

His older brothers might have called their father strict, but what Kody experienced was plain cruel. He had too train with weights woven into his clothes, had to perform perfectly or was punished for it, and was often not given the top-quality gear the family had access to, but rather had to learn to make use of the old(er), not quite fitting, shed training gear of his brothers. This has left him with a lot of unresolved trauma, which he's yet to properly process. It has also left him with notable talent in working with little, thinking in the moment, and a very strong sense of justice, which he was denied growing up. His physical prowess is among the highest, with his success rate hovering close to 80% as opposed to the more usual 65-70% for other assassins.

Despite being raised so differently, the twins have developed a close bond, and Jane regularly gave Kody backyard lessons in magic use, which, while far from as good as the private tutors she was afforded, prevented him from becoming completely detached from his magic.

It was this bond that eventually saved him a lot of hardship (on top of the hardship he was about to experience) when at age 14, they were both sent by their father on a rite of passage, to perform their first kills. Jane was given a pretty middle-of-the-bunch target whom she killed with relative ease, while Kody was sent to confront and dispatch a notorious mage against whom (mages) he only received second-hand training through Jane. He naturally failed to kill the mage, and was forced to flee the scene while his observers got discovered and killed by the mage.

Failure meant disownment, and being stripped of the family title entirely. To prevent this through a technicality, he took a family heirloom; a dagger, which, as it turns out, has some unique magical properties on top of just being an expensive weapon. Jane aided him in this, pre-packaging the dagger for him to take before he was discovered in the Johnson hold. Without the dagger, his father lacked the credentials to enter a few of their vaults, one of which held the official list of family members. Kody saw it when their younger sister Judy was born and added to the ledger, and knew he had to either gain access to it or prevent his father from accessing it once this day came.

After having left the family, he spent a year or so drifting, covertly entering his family's vaults, and taking what he needed to survive. This was when he met Lexie (Alexandra Nyma), who also just so happened to be a space magic user. She taught him a lot of how to use his magic (but also proved to be an abusive lover, which Kody only later realized) before her death to an accident. At the time, it left Kody lonely and feeling abandoned again.

In a state of depression- and trauma-fueled suicidal haze, he wandered up into the mountains, hoping to find some creature or monster which would kill him. Instead, he found a cave where his future partner, Orthus slept. The dragon is also a powerful space magic user, so Kody being drawn to the general area is not much of a surprise, but their bond is. They clicked very fast, and decided to build a home together. Some of the Johnsons' architectural style has rubbed off on Kody, and so, they built something vaguely resembling his old family hold, except for the fact that all but the front door resides in a group of extradimensional spaces, making it easily concealable, mobile, and internally non-euclidean.

After the house was done, Kody signed up with the Assassins, leveraging his existing training, intense dislike of a particular rogue assassin, and offering to work as a spy for them, as his Noble Imperial title let him access areas where not many members of the Coalition were ever allowed. Since then, he's spent his time killing the odd enemy of the Coalition, working from inside the Empire to help destabilize it on a low level, while passing time with Orthus, looking for magical artifacts as a hobby. He likes to gather up magic crystals, carefully carve them into intricate shapes, or sometimes even fashioning them into some small magical contraption, then either passing them onto someone else, or placing them into the Storage, an extradimensional museum of sorts which he discovered, abandoned, when he and Orthus were building the house. They linked it to the house, and have been using it as part Storage, part fast-travel system, setting up alternative exits to it throughout the Erigian Basin.

# William (Wolf)

He's 23, a Ranger, more specifically a Patron, which is one rank down from Master, which in turn is roughly analogous to a Jedi Master's status. He too has a dragon companion (Xini).

He was born into a small community of magic user families, with some innate, low-level magic of his own. The reason his family lived there was Violet, his older (3 years his senior) sister. He's always been into ranged weapons, and idolized Rangers since he knew how to pronounce the word, with a mentor figure in his life Halt(en Haywood - the inspiration for their parents to give them alliterative names), the master of a nearby ranger camp shadowing him from an early age.

When he was 6, their village was raided by imperial soldiers. They burned the village to the ground, and massacred its people, taking some of the young magic user girls back to the capital to be trained as Valkyries - something William did not learn until he was reunited with his sister Violet 17 years later, who had just narrowly avoided being captured that night.

William survived the raid (and the subsequent fire) by hiding in their home's basement under a rotten floorboard, where he happened upon a dragon egg, forgotten there some millennia (or even longer) ago, hatching from the emotional intensity of the situation and the fire, keeping William cold while it burned. The hatching dragon, Xini, became William's adopted sister and has been staying with him ever since.

Having lost his family, friends, and home, he headed to the next town over, whee he knew Halt would be waiting for him. He was formally adopted by Halt as his son, and raised among the other rangers, quickly advancing through the ranks as both his dad's favorite kid, and as a very capable ranger. At 23, he and Xini were sent on a pilgrimage, the rite of passage for Patrons to become Masters, which involves a visit to the Aquilans, the northern elves who are responsible for having founded the Rangers some few hundred years ago. It is on this pilgrimage that they run into Kody, and thus starts the first major story arc of my setting.

As a ranger, he's a ranged expert, his low-level telekinetic ability allowing him to gently guide his arrows into his target. He often asks Xini to freeze some moisture into arrows for him when he runs out.

# Orthus

He's **old**. Older even than he is assumed to be by most, and is actively keeping his true age a secret. He was born over 40000 years ago (≅40 if he was human), near the end of the previous Cycle, right into the middle of a cataclysmic war fought with magitech weapons. Most notably, he hatched in similar circumstances to Xini, although his mother ended up incinerating herself around the egg to protect it. He was found by a young human girl, and hatches in her arms. Because of the bond to this human, he's been very fond of humans ever since, and has taken many companions and partners from among them.

Some 3000 years ago, one of his partners caught a severe case of the wizard's hubris, and ended up annihilated by an eldritch crystal (a supercharged magic crystal universally known for their tendency to become hubris catalysts, then crack and explode) in a way that got the gods' attention. Orthus was held partially responsible, and was basically put on house arrest, only able to visit a few pre-negotiated locations, the Aquilans being one of them. He is not to mention his life pre-house arrest, nor the fact that he was on house arrest, only being formally released when he met Kody, the young assassing being deemed a good probation exercise for him.

He has a large bundle of magical powers, chief among which being his space magic, fire magic, and earth magic. He has traces of time and darkness magic as well (for details, check out my [post](https://redd.it/1i1u3nw) on r/magicbuilding), and is a generally stoic figure, who can nonetheless throw some (magically empowered) punches when necessary.

He's a full-fledged shapeshifter, being able to take any living form, mimic any living thing, or choose to adjust any of his taken forms indefinitely. Given his propensity for liking humans, he most often takes the form of a dark-skinned male, with an apparent age consistent with his current mood.

He is transgender. He lived most of his life as either a female dragon or human, or in some androgynous form, not really thinking about it. His strong magic and resulting near-sterility meant that sexual activity did not result in anything, up until one day it did. Some 400 year or so ago, he got pregnant, and grew immensely dysphoric about it. He ended up abandoning the egg (as is sadly the case for most dragon parents), and has only taken male-presenting forms since then. During the story, he rediscovers the egg, and decides to take care of it, hoping to raise his daughter Lexie when(if) she hatches as her father. In the meantime, through Kody and William's meeting, he met Xini and has adopted her as a surrogate daughter, learning into the role of fatherhood through her, all the while helping the young dragon learn into what it means to be a dragon.

# Xini (formerly Zeenie ^[\[1\]](https://redd.it/1ep20lw),[\[2\]](https://redd.it/1f00u41) )

I've mentioned her before over on r/CharacterDevelopment, but haven't truly fleshed her out here yet. As mentioned above, she hatched in William's arms as his family's home was burning to the ground above them. The intense emotional spike triggered her hatching, and bound her and William together for life.

Growing up with him, she'd always felt like a bit of an accessory to him, being treated always as William's sister (or even worse, pet) rather than her own person, and was never truly given the kind of agency she desired. As they leave for William's pilgrimage, her annoyance at the situation grows, and starts her off on a journey of self-actualization.

She's a so-called shapeswitcher, being further down the line of descent from her most recent godly ancestor than Orthus, being only capable of switching between two set forms; her ""true"" dragon self, and a so-called vern form. The vern are a short-statured, timid lizardfolk, who have evolved together with dragons so that they look alike and dragons can hide among them in vern form. Dragons gain community and the vern gain protection from the arrangement. She has a potential 2-3 more forms left in her, which Orthus helps her achieve at the Aquilans, once the party splits and he accompanies William and her to the elves.

Part of her self-actualization journey is realizing they're trans, more specifically feminine-presenting (she/they) nonbinary. This is also the time of their name change from her original (Zeenie) to the similar(same)-sounding, but more androgynous Xini. It's an overall small step that means a lot to them. William does not properly understand this, which works to drive them further apart, but eventually he'll be forced to realize she's her own person.

She's 17 as the story starts, spending most of their time in vern form. They're nimble, fast, and her tail gives some extra maneuverability which she exploits to great effect. They're a pretty good close- and hand-to-hand combatant, complimenting William's more range-oriented approach. On her own, she can be pretty stealthy as well, which makes her a perfect thief, which is why she meets Kody in the opening scene (they're after the same artifact and happen to be there for it at the same time).

# Ezon (Athor)

Ezon is an unrelated outsider at the start, only meeting the party once the acquire the artifact they all were after. He's somewhere in his 60's in terms of raw years, though based on his physical state it would be hard to tell he's older than 25. He's there for the artifact too, as part of his life goal to kill a god. He's not some hubristic idiot chasing glory, but has a very specific grudge to settle with a very specific god. He needs the power from the artifact (and many more like it) to become strong enough to defeat Nefest, his godly nemesis. The nex (name for the group/type of gods active in Eldara) are largely with him on this, though not directly. Nefest (he/they) is a very low-tier nex who'd been causing trouble for millennia. The other nex won't let him do any major harm on a civilizational level (anymore), but they're allowed to keep at whatever low-grade thing they are doing at the moment. Ezon comes into the picture because of his (somewhat) unique ability to absorb power from Nefest, thus being able to disable them from doing any more harm.

Ezon has gained his ability through unnatural means, being kidnapped by cultists at a very young age, believing him to be a vessel for one of the Elder gods (he is). They experimented on him, managing to magically skew his perception along time, so that now he can see the most probable future up to around 20 seconds ahead in his immediate vicinity, and infecting him with a kind of magical fungus that allows him to forcefully draw magical power out of crystals, artifacts, people, and even the nex, should one of them get within melee range in a physical form. He's become extremely durable, and regenerates even faster than the baseline for Eldara (which is still extremely fast compared to IRL healing). Any injury that does not kill him instantly is just a momentary obstacle, with deep gashes and broken bones healing within seconds, even near-fatal injuries only taking him a few minutes at most to recover from. He can regrow lost limbs and digits within an hour, and further accelerate his healing by actively draining power from something (or someone) else.

After his initial, combative meeting with the group concludes, and he is forced to work along them for a few days, he develops a crush on Kody, and starts pursuing him romantically. The relationship takes a while to develop, but by the time he meets Nefest again (after Nefest tried to drive them against eachother with Violet, whom they recover in the meantime), he is well and truly defensive of Kody, almost succeeding to drain all of Nefest's power during the encounter.

Given that he is basically a sanctioned godly warrior, my long-term plans with him is to become a kind of linchpin for the high-er level godly conflicts. He will eventually become powerful enough that he can meaningfully sacrifice himself to allow a resolution to the godly conflict.

# Violet (Wolf)

Violet was born to the Wolf family somewhat unexpectedly, her magical abilities manifesting very quickly afterwards. The family moved outside the New Erigian Empire to let her learn into it instead of being killed or kidnapped for it. She was 9 when the raid came, and managed to get away with 5 of her friends for about a day before being found. They took refuge in the next town over at one of the friends' aunts and her family. A group of rogue assassins (>!led by Kody's father at the time!<) killed the family, and kidnapped the 5 magic-user girls, missing Violet by sheer chance. She was forced to flee and lay low for the next few years.

She was eventually taken in from the street by an old mage, who taught her some basics about how to access deeper parts of her magic, but turned on her when they discovered she was a blood mage. [Blood magic](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1i4jlia/what_is_an_unconventional_form_of_magic_in_your/m7ylurp/) is associated with a social stigma, and blood mages are hunted even in communities that are otherwise inclusive of magic users, because how dangerous they think the magic type is. Rangers have a kill-on-sight order against blood mages, and even non-ranger-discovered blood mages can basically expect to be lynched if outed publicly. Because of this, she got even more isolated from general society, and was basically chased out of every community she ever tried joining. By the time she discovers the party (initially trying to avenge herself on Ezon, who at some point took a bunch of magic crystals off of her), she is truly and well an outsider.

She's independently mastered Conjuration, the ability to manifest weapons and simple tools out of pure magical energy, which lets her use her magic without it easily outing her. She's also learned how to disguise it as nature magic (the healing-type magic) and is living mostly alone, taking occasional partners when she fancies. A couple of her boyfriends turned out to be either Empire informants or ranger spies, so she lately mostly only gets together with women, whom she'd found are less likely to try to stab her in the back.

She's also acquired a daemon sometime in the intervening years. It is a (mostly) benevolent, symbiotic dark spirit which feeds off of her emotions, and defends her in combat, as well as warning her or impending danger in some cases.

After she joins the group again, she realizes William is a ranger, and panics. When the party splits, she joins Kody and Ezon, whose will they/wont they routine is starting to drive her mad when Nefest arrives, taking away her daemon temporarily, and goading her into attacking the two men. In the middle of it, Nefest strikes, and is only stopped from killing the group by Ezon's power of absorption, which still leaves all of them greatly exhausted by the time they realize they've been played for fools.

# Elvira

I've talked about her [before](https://redd.it/1hlba6p) in detail over on r/CharacterDevelopment so I'm not gonna rehash a lot of it here. The main points are: She's a dragon, individually pretty powerful, trans, and most importantly, an anarchist.

She enters the story right after the above described fight between Violet, Kody, Ezon, and Nefest. She collects all three of them as prisoners of war, as the New Erigian Empire is continually attacking her homeland, the Haraevaneum. The fact that they are fighting against the Empire gives her little pause as she knows the Coalition is merely another hierarchy seeking to replace the Empire (in a coup later dubbed ""The Takeover""). Kody is actively working for the Coalition, Ezon is pretty defensive of him, but Violet doesn't seem to belong to any particular hierarchy, and so, she manages to convince Elvira that letting them go (and helping them temporarily) is a better course of action against the Empire than keeping them there.

She joins the group, and only leaves when later on they're recruited into carrying out a part of The Takeover, which she wants nothing to do with, as it goes against her entire ideology.

She is seen again, roughly 3000 years later, when, due to another lost battle against Nefest, the group gets frozen in time and experience what the world had become after The Takeover, she turns up again, having lived through that time manually, and having carved out an anarchist niche with her people within the new world for themselves.

Dragons have ended up as kind of an allegory for trans people, and she's no exception to this. She's 655 years old (≅30 if she was human) when she initially turns up, and by then, she'd live most of her life as a woman. Her transition came about at the same time as her ideological turnaround, initially having hatched into a human, noble family, and ruled as a tyrant for about 20 years before she realized she was perpetuating the same system that led to the collapse after which she and her adopted family ended up ruling. She put a rather drastic end to that kingdom herself, and has joined up with the (largely) anarchist society of the Haraevaneum, calling it her homeland ever since.

She is tangentially responsible for the existence of the New Erigian Empire through the power vacuum she created, and the Empire keeps sending mercenaries and rogue assassins after her, which has prompted her to move back into the Erigian Basin, and work a bit more actively on aiding its collapse.

Her later (re)appearance in the new world as a 3600 years-old dragon puts here at roughly the equivalent age of a 35 years old human. In the meantime, she'd changed roughly as much as you can expect a 30-35 years old human to change with such drastic changes in circumstances."

# Kody (Johnson)

He's 22 years old, works as an assassin, lives with a dragon (Orthus) and has already had a pretty convoluted life.

Born as the 3rd son to a noble family in the New Erigian Empire, he had little chance of properly inheriting the family title. His family are so-called rogue assassins, going against the designs of The Coalition (the joined leadership of Assassins and Rangers), and got their noble title by betraying the Coalition.

After 2 sons, they wanted a daughter, with plans of having her be a strong magic user, so they prepared by consuming large amounts of magic potions before trying for their 3rd kid. When it turned out they were twins, the decision was made. Jane, Kody's twin sister, was raised as a powerful time magic user, her name even following the family naming tradition (all J-names), while Kody was forbidden from learning into his own (space magic). Instead, his training focused on the physical, and due to him being a surprise, it was especially demanding.

His older brothers might have called their father strict, but what Kody experienced was plain cruel. He had too train with weights woven into his clothes, had to perform perfectly or was punished for it, and was often not given the top-quality gear the family had access to, but rather had to learn to make use of the old(er), not quite fitting, shed training gear of his brothers. This has left him with a lot of unresolved trauma, which he's yet to properly process. It has also left him with notable talent in working with little, thinking in the moment, and a very strong sense of justice, which he was denied growing up. His physical prowess is among the highest, with his success rate hovering close to 80% as opposed to the more usual 65-70% for other assassins.

Despite being raised so differently, the twins have developed a close bond, and Jane regularly gave Kody backyard lessons in magic use, which, while far from as good as the private tutors she was afforded, prevented him from becoming completely detached from his magic.

It was this bond that eventually saved him a lot of hardship (on top of the hardship he was about to experience) when at age 14, they were both sent by their father on a rite of passage, to perform their first kills. Jane was given a pretty middle-of-the-bunch target whom she killed with relative ease, while Kody was sent to confront and dispatch a notorious mage against whom (mages) he only received second-hand training through Jane. He naturally failed to kill the mage, and was forced to flee the scene while his observers got discovered and killed by the mage.

Failure meant disownment, and being stripped of the family title entirely. To prevent this through a technicality, he took a family heirloom; a dagger, which, as it turns out, has some unique magical properties on top of just being an expensive weapon. Jane aided him in this, pre-packaging the dagger for him to take before he was discovered in the Johnson hold. Without the dagger, his father lacked the credentials to enter a few of their vaults, one of which held the official list of family members. Kody saw it when their younger sister Judy was born and added to the ledger, and knew he had to either gain access to it or prevent his father from accessing it once this day came.

After having left the family, he spent a year or so drifting, covertly entering his family's vaults, and taking what he needed to survive. This was when he met Lexie (Alexandra Nyma), who also just so happened to be a space magic user. She taught him a lot of how to use his magic (but also proved to be an abusive lover, which Kody only later realized) before her death to an accident. At the time, it left Kody lonely and feeling abandoned again.

In a state of depression- and trauma-fueled suicidal haze, he wandered up into the mountains, hoping to find some creature or monster which would kill him. Instead, he found a cave where his future partner, Orthus slept. The dragon is also a powerful space magic user, so Kody being drawn to the general area is not much of a surprise, but their bond is. They clicked very fast, and decided to build a home together. Some of the Johnsons' architectural style has rubbed off on Kody, and so, they built something vaguely resembling his old family hold, except for the fact that all but the front door resides in a group of extradimensional spaces, making it easily concealable, mobile, and internally non-euclidean.

She was 9 when the raid came, and managed to get away with 5 of her friends for about a day before being found. They took refuge in the next town over at one of the friends' aunts and her family. A group of rogue assassins (>!led by Kody's father at the time!<) killed the family, and kidnapped the 5 magic-user girls, missing Violet by sheer chance. She was forced to flee and lay low for the next few years.

She was eventually taken in from the street by an old mage, who taught her some basics about how to access deeper parts of her magic, but turned on her when they discovered she was a blood mage. [Blood magic](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1i4jlia/what_is_an_unconventional_form_of_magic_in_your/m7ylurp/) is associated with a social stigma, and blood mages are hunted even in communities that are otherwise inclusive of magic users, because how dangerous they think the magic type is. Rangers have a kill-on-sight order against blood mages, and even non-ranger-discovered blood mages can basically expect to be lynched if outed publicly. Because of this, she got even more isolated from general society, and was basically chased out of every community she ever tried joining. By the time she discovers the party (initially trying to avenge herself on Ezon, who at some point took a bunch of magic crystals off of her), she is truly and well an outsider.

She's independently mastered Conjuration, the ability to manifest weapons and simple tools out of pure magical energy, which lets her use her magic without it easily outing her. She's also learned how to disguise it as nature magic (the healing-type magic) and is living mostly alone, taking occasional partners when she fancies. A couple of her boyfriends turned out to be either Empire informants or ranger spies, so she lately mostly only gets together with women, whom she'd found are less likely to try to stab her in the back.

She's also acquired a daemon sometime in the intervening years. It is a (mostly) benevolent, symbiotic dark spirit which feeds off of her emotions, and defends her in combat, as well as warning her or impending danger in some cases.

After she joins the group again, she realizes William is a ranger, and panics. When the party splits, she joins Kody and Ezon, whose will they/wont they routine is starting to drive her mad when Nefest arrives, taking away her daemon temporarily, and goading her into attacking the two men. In the middle of it, Nefest strikes, and is only stopped from killing the group by Ezon's power of absorption, which still leaves all of them greatly exhausted by the time they realize they've been played for fools.

# Elvira

I've talked about her [before](https://redd.it/1hlba6p) in detail over on r/CharacterDevelopment so I'm not gonna rehash a lot of it here. The main points are: She's a dragon, individually pretty powerful, trans, and most importantly, an anarchist.

She enters the story right after the above described fight between Violet, Kody, Ezon, and Nefest. She collects all three of them as prisoners of war, as the New Erigian Empire is continually attacking her homeland, the Haraevaneum. The fact that they are fighting against the Empire gives her little pause as she knows the Coalition is merely another hierarchy seeking to replace the Empire (in a coup later dubbed ""The Takeover""). Kody is actively working for the Coalition, Ezon is pretty defensive of him, but Violet doesn't seem to belong to any particular hierarchy, and so, she manages to convince Elvira that letting them go (and helping them temporarily) is a better course of action against the Empire than keeping them there.

She joins the group, and only leaves when later on they're recruited into carrying out a part of The Takeover, which she wants nothing to do with, as it goes against her entire ideology.

She is seen again, roughly 3000 years later, when, due to another lost battle against Nefest, the group gets frozen in time and experience what the world had become after The Takeover, she turns up again, having lived through that time manually, and having carved out an anarchist niche with her people within the new world for themselves.

Dragons have ended up as kind of an allegory for trans people, and she's no exception to this. She's 655 years old (≅30 if she was human) when she initially turns up, and by then, she'd live most of her life as a woman. Her transition came about at the same time as her ideological turnaround, initially having hatched into a human, noble family, and ruled as a tyrant for about 20 years before she realized she was perpetuating the same system that led to the collapse after which she and her adopted family ended up ruling. She put a rather drastic end to that kingdom herself, and has joined up with the (largely) anarchist society of the Haraevaneum, calling it her homeland ever since.

She is tangentially responsible for the existence of the New Erigian Empire through the power vacuum she created, and the Empire keeps sending mercenaries and rogue assassins after her, which has prompted her to move back into the Erigian Basin, and work a bit more actively on aiding its collapse.

Her later (re)appearance in the new world as a 3600 years-old dragon puts here at roughly the equivalent age of a 35 years old human. In the meantime, she'd changed roughly as much as you can expect a 30-35 years old human to change with such drastic changes in circumstances."

TL;DR for the world, [because apparently the text below the second line is not enough context](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1i4zzug/eldara_character_showcase/m80t1lp/):

# The World

The world is medieval high-fantasy, with a powerful, [soft magic system](https://redd.it/1glmx1q) comprised of an [elemental](https://redd.it/1i1u3nw), [nonelemental](https://redd.it/1i2w6zv), and [symbolic](https://redd.it/1ggfml6) subsystem, all intertwined through the raw magical energy that makes it all move together.

Eldara is inhabited by many sapient species, who, for the time being, are mostly concentrated into species-based nation states, with their own politics, economies, forms of government, and overall effect on the planet as a whole.

# Context

* The **New Erigian Empire** is a despotic, patrilineal hereditary monarchy with the royal family being specifically bred to remove as much inherent magic from them as possible in their pursuit towards perfection. This stance is reflected in the oppression, genocide, and slavery of magic users throughout the Empire, and has spawned a number of organizations dedicated on the long run to replacing the Empire's leadership and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity. These are the following:

* **Rangers** were founded by [Aquilan Elves](https://redd.it/1h9lhvz) with a primary goal to aid magic users, then left to their own devices to derive that The Empire needed to be overthrown. The function as the formal military of The Coalition, and are generally regarded as peacekeepers throughout the Erigian Basin. They also did the equivalent of The Witch Hunts against blood magic users, and are still a major contributor to the low frequency of visible blood mages.

* **Assassins** Started out as an Imperial black ops unit, initially to hunt down Elvira, then repurposed and revamped to be a hopeful replacement of the Rangers, ""keeping the peace"" by functioning as state-employed thugs and actual assassins. They instead left The Empire and joined with the rangers to for The Coalition, the two organizations merging at the top, sharing a [High Council and Grand Master](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=author%3A_Ceaseless_Watcher_+""high+council""&type=comments).

* **Valkyries** are an exclusively female group of elite magic-users, who were all kidnapped as children and brainwashed, or just plainly forced to work for The Empire by keeping their fellow Valkyries as hostages each time a group is sent out on a mission. They are also paraded about as an example of what ""good"" magic users can do, as opposed to the genocide and general oppression that ""bad"" magic users get.

* **The Takeover** is the grand coup the entire story and the below listed characters' lives are working towards, wherein the entire New Erigian aristocracy, and all Imperial officials and military leaders are murdered, to be replaced by people loyal to The Coalition.

TL;DR for each character and their role, just in case the text is still not enough context:

* Kody:

 Works as an assassin, leveraging his noble family title to get into otherwise harder-to-access areas of The Empire; vaults, political targets, etc.

* William:

 Ranger on a pilgrimage to meet the Aquilans, their founders, to become a ranger Master and be able to offer his help in a more managerial position.

* Orthus:

 Ancient dragon living with Kody, helping him in whatever he is doing; stealing powerful/valuable artifacts from Imperial vaults, dispatching the odd Imperial official, massacring an Imperial military outpost, or just going out to find new magical trinkets for Kody to use.

* Xini:

 Young dragon, adopted sister to William, helping him in his role as a soon-to-be ranger master, all the while trying to self-actualize in a way that doesn't entirely destroy her and William's relationship.

* Ezon:

 The physical embodiment of revenge against a specific god, having dedicated his entire life to killing Nefest - a low-tier nex (god) who's responsible for the collapse of an entire elven civilization to the south of the Erigian Basin.

* Violet:

 Long thought-lost sister of William, blood mage, trying to resolve this while stalked by Nefest, eventually becoming a major asset to the group as a whole, and thus to The Takeover.

* Elvira:

 Young/Middle-aged dragon, anarchist, and one of the indirect reasons the New Erigian Empire exists at all. She is in the Erigian Basin because The Empire keeps trying to kill her personally, knowing that she has been one of their major enemies since before the Empire even really existed. She does not approve of The Takeover, but sees the need to replace The Empire with basically anything else, hoping that she may be able to carve out a niche for people like her in the new world.

# Kody (Johnson)

He's 22 years old, works as an assassin, lives with a dragon (Orthus) and has already had a pretty convoluted life.

Born as the 3rd son to a noble family in the New Erigian Empire, he had little chance of properly inheriting the family title. His family are so-called rogue assassins, going against the designs of The Coalition (the joined leadership of Assassins and Rangers), and got their noble title by betraying the Coalition.

After 2 sons, they wanted a daughter, with plans of having her be a strong magic user, so they prepared by consuming large amounts of magic potions before trying for their 3rd kid. When it turned out they were twins, the decision was made. Jane, Kody's twin sister, was raised as a powerful time magic user, her name even following the family naming tradition (all J-names), while Kody was forbidden from learning into his own (space magic). Instead, his training focused on the physical, and due to him being a surprise, it was especially demanding.

His older brothers might have called their father strict, but what Kody experienced was plain cruel. He had too train with weights woven into his clothes, had to perform perfectly or was punished for it, and was often not given the top-quality gear the family had access to, but rather had to learn to make use of the old(er), not quite fitting, shed training gear of his brothers. This has left him with a lot of unresolved trauma, which he's yet to properly process. It has also left him with notable talent in working with little, thinking in the moment, and a very strong sense of justice, which he was denied growing up. His physical prowess is among the highest, with his success rate hovering close to 80% as opposed to the more usual 65-70% for other assassins.

Despite being raised so differently, the twins have developed a close bond, and Jane regularly gave Kody backyard lessons in magic use, which, while far from as good as the private tutors she was afforded, prevented him from becoming completely detached from his magic.

It was this bond that eventually saved him a lot of hardship (on top of the hardship he was about to experience) when at age 14, they were both sent by their father on a rite of passage, to perform their first kills. Jane was given a pretty middle-of-the-bunch target whom she killed with relative ease, while Kody was sent to confront and dispatch a notorious mage against whom (mages) he only received second-hand training through Jane. He naturally failed to kill the mage, and was forced to flee the scene while his observers got discovered and killed by the mage.

Failure meant disownment, and being stripped of the family title entirely. To prevent this through a technicality, he took a family heirloom; a dagger, which, as it turns out, has some unique magical properties on top of just being an expensive weapon. Jane aided him in this, pre-packaging the dagger for him to take before he was discovered in the Johnson hold. Without the dagger, his father lacked the credentials to enter a few of their vaults, one of which held the official list of family members. Kody saw it when their younger sister Judy was born and added to the ledger, and knew he had to either gain access to it or prevent his father from accessing it once this day came.

After having left the family, he spent a year or so drifting, covertly entering his family's vaults, and taking what he needed to survive. This was when he met Lexie (Alexandra Nyma), who also just so happened to be a space magic user. She taught him a lot of how to use his magic (but also proved to be an abusive lover, which Kody only later realized) before her death to an accident. At the time, it left Kody lonely and feeling abandoned again.

In a state of depression- and trauma-fueled suicidal haze, he wandered up into the mountains, hoping to find some creature or monster which would kill him. Instead, he found a cave where his future partner, Orthus slept. The dragon is also a powerful space magic user, so Kody being drawn to the general area is not much of a surprise, but their bond is. They clicked very fast, and decided to build a home together. Some of the Johnsons' architectural style has rubbed off on Kody, and so, they built something vaguely resembling his old family hold, except for the fact that all but the front door resides in a group of extradimensional spaces, making it easily concealable, mobile, and internally non-euclidean.

After the house was done, Kody signed up with the Assassins, leveraging his existing training, intense dislike of a particular rogue assassin, and offering to work as a spy for them, as his Noble Imperial title let him access areas where not many members of the Coalition were ever allowed. Since then, he's spent his time killing the odd enemy of the Coalition, working from inside the Empire to help destabilize it on a low level, while passing time with Orthus, looking for magical artifacts as a hobby. He likes to gather up magic crystals, carefully carve them into intricate shapes, or sometimes even fashioning them into some small magical contraption, then either passing them onto someone else, or placing them into the Storage, an extradimensional museum of sorts which he discovered, abandoned, when he and Orthus were building the house. They linked it to the house, and have been using it as part Storage, part fast-travel system, setting up alternative exits to it throughout the Erigian Basin.

# William (Wolf)

He's 23, a Ranger, more specifically a Patron, which is one rank down from Master, which in turn is roughly analogous to a Jedi Master's status. He too has a dragon companion (Xini).

He was born into a small community of magic user families, with some innate, low-level magic of his own. The reason his family lived there was Violet, his older (3 years his senior) sister. He's always been into ranged weapons, and idolized Rangers since he knew how to pronounce the word, with a mentor figure in his life Halt(en Haywood - the inspiration for their parents to give them alliterative names), the master of a nearby ranger camp shadowing him from an early age.

When he was 6, their village was raided by imperial soldiers. They burned the village to the ground, and massacred its people, taking some of the young magic user girls back to the capital to be trained as Valkyries - something William did not learn until he was reunited with his sister Violet 17 years later, who had just narrowly avoided being captured that night.

William survived the raid (and the subsequent fire) by hiding in their home's basement under a rotten floorboard, where he happened upon a dragon egg, forgotten there some millennia (or even longer) ago, hatching from the emotional intensity of the situation and the fire, keeping William cold while it burned. The hatching dragon, Xini, became William's adopted sister and has been staying with him ever since.

Having lost his family, friends, and home, he headed to the next town over, whee he knew Halt would be waiting for him. He was formally adopted by Halt as his son, and raised among the other rangers, quickly advancing through the ranks as both his dad's favorite kid, and as a very capable ranger. At 23, he and Xini were sent on a pilgrimage, the rite of passage for Patrons to become Masters, which involves a visit to the Aquilans, the northern elves who are responsible for having founded the Rangers some few hundred years ago. It is on this pilgrimage that they run into Kody, and thus starts the first major story arc of my setting.

As a ranger, he's a ranged expert, his low-level telekinetic ability allowing him to gently guide his arrows into his target. He often asks Xini to freeze some moisture into arrows for him when he runs out.

# Orthus

He's **old**. Older even than he is assumed to be by most, and is actively keeping his true age a secret. He was born over 40000 years ago (≅40 if he was human), near the end of the previous Cycle, right into the middle of a cataclysmic war fought with magitech weapons. Most notably, he hatched in similar circumstances to Xini, although his mother ended up incinerating herself around the egg to protect it. He was found by a young human girl, and hatches in her arms. Because of the bond to this human, he's been very fond of humans ever since, and has taken many companions and partners from among them.

Some 3000 years ago, one of his partners caught a severe case of the wizard's hubris, and ended up annihilated by an eldritch crystal (a supercharged magic crystal universally known for their tendency to become hubris catalysts, then crack and explode) in a way that got the gods' attention. Orthus was held partially responsible, and was basically put on house arrest, only able to visit a few pre-negotiated locations, the Aquilans being one of them. He is not to mention his life pre-house arrest, nor the fact that he was on house arrest, only being formally released when he met Kody, the young assassing being deemed a good probation exercise for him.

He has a large bundle of magical powers, chief among which being his space magic, fire magic, and earth magic. He has traces of time and darkness magic as well (for details, check out my [post](https://redd.it/1i1u3nw) on r/magicbuilding), and is a generally stoic figure, who can nonetheless throw some (magically empowered) punches when necessary.

He's a full-fledged shapeshifter, being able to take any living form, mimic any living thing, or choose to adjust any of his taken forms indefinitely. Given his propensity for liking humans, he most often takes the form of a dark-skinned male, with an apparent age consistent with his current mood.

He is transgender. He lived most of his life as either a female dragon or human, or in some androgynous form, not really thinking about it. His strong magic and resulting near-sterility meant that sexual activity did not result in anything, up until one day it did. Some 400 year or so ago, he got pregnant, and grew immensely dysphoric about it. He ended up abandoning the egg (as is sadly the case for most dragon parents), and has only taken male-presenting forms since then. During the story, he rediscovers the egg, and decides to take care of it, hoping to raise his daughter Lexie when(if) she hatches as her father. In the meantime, through Kody and William's meeting, he met Xini and has adopted her as a surrogate daughter, learning into the role of fatherhood through her, all the while helping the young dragon learn into what it means to be a dragon.

# Xini (formerly Zeenie ^[\[1\]](https://redd.it/1ep20lw),[\[2\]](https://redd.it/1f00u41) )

I've mentioned her before over on r/CharacterDevelopment, but haven't truly fleshed her out here yet. As mentioned above, she hatched in William's arms as his family's home was burning to the ground above them. The intense emotional spike triggered her hatching, and bound her and William together for life.

Growing up with him, she'd always felt like a bit of an accessory to him, being treated always as William's sister (or even worse, pet) rather than her own person, and was never truly given the kind of agency she desired. As they leave for William's pilgrimage, her annoyance at the situation grows, and starts her off on a journey of self-actualization.

She's a so-called shapeswitcher, being further down the line of descent from her most recent godly ancestor than Orthus, being only capable of switching between two set forms; her ""true"" dragon self, and a so-called vern form. The vern are a short-statured, timid lizardfolk, who have evolved together with dragons so that they look alike and dragons can hide among them in vern form. Dragons gain community and the vern gain protection from the arrangement. She has a potential 2-3 more forms left in her, which Orthus helps her achieve at the Aquilans, once the party splits and he accompanies William and her to the elves.

Part of her self-actualization journey is realizing they're trans, more specifically feminine-presenting (she/they) nonbinary. This is also the time of their name change from her original (Zeenie) to the similar(same)-sounding, but more androgynous Xini. It's an overall small step that means a lot to them. William does not properly understand this, which works to drive them further apart, but eventually he'll be forced to realize she's her own person.

She's 17 as the story starts, spending most of their time in vern form. They're nimble, fast, and her tail gives some extra maneuverability which she exploits to great effect. They're a pretty good close- and hand-to-hand combatant, complimenting William's more range-oriented approach. On her own, she can be pretty stealthy as well, which makes her a perfect thief, which is why she meets Kody in the opening scene (they're after the same artifact and happen to be there for it at the same time).

# Ezon (Athor)

Ezon is an unrelated outsider at the start, only meeting the party once the acquire the artifact they all were after. He's somewhere in his 60's in terms of raw years, though based on his physical state it would be hard to tell he's older than 25. He's there for the artifact too, as part of his life goal to kill a god. He's not some hubristic idiot chasing glory, but has a very specific grudge to settle with a very specific god. He needs the power from the artifact (and many more like it) to become strong enough to defeat Nefest, his godly nemesis. The nex (name for the group/type of gods active in Eldara) are largely with him on this, though not directly. Nefest (he/they) is a very low-tier nex who'd been causing trouble for millennia. The other nex won't let him do any major harm on a civilizational level (anymore), but they're allowed to keep at whatever low-grade thing they are doing at the moment. Ezon comes into the picture because of his (somewhat) unique ability to absorb power from Nefest, thus being able to disable them from doing any more harm.

Ezon has gained his ability through unnatural means, being kidnapped by cultists at a very young age, believing him to be a vessel for one of the Elder gods (he is). They experimented on him, managing to magically skew his perception along time, so that now he can see the most probable future up to around 20 seconds ahead in his immediate vicinity, and infecting him with a kind of magical fungus that allows him to forcefully draw magical power out of crystals, artifacts, people, and even the nex, should one of them get within melee range in a physical form. He's become extremely durable, and regenerates even faster than the baseline for Eldara (which is still extremely fast compared to IRL healing). Any injury that does not kill him instantly is just a momentary obstacle, with deep gashes and broken bones healing within seconds, even near-fatal injuries only taking him a few minutes at most to recover from. He can regrow lost limbs and digits within an hour, and further accelerate his healing by actively draining power from something (or someone) else.

After his initial, combative meeting with the group concludes, and he is forced to work along them for a few days, he develops a crush on Kody, and starts pursuing him romantically. The relationship takes a while to develop, but by the time he meets Nefest again (after Nefest tried to drive them against eachother with Violet, whom they recover in the meantime), he is well and truly defensive of Kody, almost succeeding to drain all of Nefest's power during the encounter.

Given that he is basically a sanctioned godly warrior, my long-term plans with him is to become a kind of linchpin for the high-er level godly conflicts. He will eventually become powerful enough that he can meaningfully sacrifice himself to allow a resolution to the godly conflict.

# Violet (Wolf)

Violet was born to the Wolf family somewhat unexpectedly, her magical abilities manifesting very quickly afterwards. The family moved outside the New Erigian Empire to let her learn into it instead of being killed or kidnapped for it. She was 9 when the raid came, and managed to get away with 5 of her friends for about a day before being found. They took refuge in the next town over at one of the friends' aunts and her family. A group of rogue assassins (>!led by Kody's father at the time!<) killed the family, and kidnapped the 5 magic-user girls, missing Violet by sheer chance. She was forced to flee and lay low for the next few years.

She was eventually taken in from the street by an old mage, who taught her some basics about how to access deeper parts of her magic, but turned on her when they discovered she was a blood mage. [Blood magic](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1i4jlia/what_is_an_unconventional_form_of_magic_in_your/m7ylurp/) is associated with a social stigma, and blood mages are hunted even in communities that are otherwise inclusive of magic users, because how dangerous they think the magic type is. Rangers have a kill-on-sight order against blood mages, and even non-ranger-discovered blood mages can basically expect to be lynched if outed publicly. Because of this, she got even more isolated from general society, and was basically chased out of every community she ever tried joining. By the time she discovers the party (initially trying to avenge herself on Ezon, who at some point took a bunch of magic crystals off of her), she is truly and well an outsider.

She's independently mastered Conjuration, the ability to manifest weapons and simple tools out of pure magical energy, which lets her use her magic without it easily outing her. She's also learned how to disguise it as nature magic (the healing-type magic) and is living mostly alone, taking occasional partners when she fancies. A couple of her boyfriends turned out to be either Empire informants or ranger spies, so she lately mostly only gets together with women, whom she'd found are less likely to try to stab her in the back.

She's also acquired a daemon sometime in the intervening years. It is a (mostly) benevolent, symbiotic dark spirit which feeds off of her emotions, and defends her in combat, as well as warning her or impending danger in some cases.

After she joins the group again, she realizes William is a ranger, and panics. When the party splits, she joins Kody and Ezon, whose will they/wont they routine is starting to drive her mad when Nefest arrives, taking away her daemon temporarily, and goading her into attacking the two men. In the middle of it, Nefest strikes, and is only stopped from killing the group by Ezon's power of absorption, which still leaves all of them greatly exhausted by the time they realize they've been played for fools.

# Elvira

I've talked about her [before](https://redd.it/1hlba6p) in detail over on r/CharacterDevelopment so I'm not gonna rehash a lot of it here. The main points are: She's a dragon, individually pretty powerful, trans, and most importantly, an anarchist.

She enters the story right after the above described fight between Violet, Kody, Ezon, and Nefest. She collects all three of them as prisoners of war, as the New Erigian Empire is continually attacking her homeland, the Haraevaneum. The fact that they are fighting against the Empire gives her little pause as she knows the Coalition is merely another hierarchy seeking to replace the Empire (in a coup later dubbed ""The Takeover""). Kody is actively working for the Coalition, Ezon is pretty defensive of him, but Violet doesn't seem to belong to any particular hierarchy, and so, she manages to convince Elvira that letting them go (and helping them temporarily) is a better course of action against the Empire than keeping them there.

She is tangentially responsible for the existence of the New Erigian Empire through the power vacuum she created, and the Empire keeps sending mercenaries and rogue assassins after her, which has prompted her to move back into the Erigian Basin, and work a bit more actively on aiding its collapse.

Her later (re)appearance in the new world as a 3600 years-old dragon puts here at roughly the equivalent age of a 35 years old human. In the meantime, she'd changed roughly as much as you can expect a 30-35 years old human to change with such drastic changes in circumstances."

Government Backed Crypto and other crypto based use cases for GOOD,myideasforhumanity_80,1i53t4l,2025-01-19 12:31:11,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/myideasforhumanity_80/comments/1i53t4l/government_backed_crypto_and_other_crypto_based/,Nvestnme,,"A government-backed cryptocurrency (central bank digital currency, or CBDC) could serve as a powerful tool for economic transformation, but it also carries risks. Here’s an analysis of how it could be used for good and bad, whether it would be suitable for paying citizens, and its potential role in creating a universal basic income (UBI):

How a Government-Backed Cryptocurrency Could Be Used for Good
	1.	Streamlining Payments
	•	Efficiency: Instantaneous, low-cost transfers could make government payments (e.g., pensions, unemployment benefits) faster and cheaper.
	•	Inclusivity: Unbanked populations could gain access to financial systems through mobile wallets, bypassing traditional banking barriers.
	2.	Improving Transparency
	•	Blockchain technology offers an immutable ledger, reducing corruption and ensuring accountability in public spending and aid distribution.
	3.	Facilitating Universal Basic Income (UBI)
	•	A CBDC could enable a government to distribute UBI directly to citizens’ wallets, bypassing bureaucratic hurdles and ensuring funds reach recipients without intermediaries.
	4.	Combatting Tax Evasion and Money Laundering
	•	Transactions could be designed to be traceable (while still respecting privacy to some extent), ensuring compliance with tax laws and reducing illicit activity.
	5.	Stabilizing the Economy
	•	A government could implement monetary policies like distributing stimulus payments quickly during economic downturns, targeting specific demographics or regions.
	6.	Encouraging Financial Literacy
	•	Adoption of a government-backed cryptocurrency could encourage citizens to better understand digital finance, fostering greater engagement with the economy.

How a Government-Backed Cryptocurrency Could Be Used for Bad
	1.	Loss of Privacy
	•	Governments might monitor every transaction, leading to potential misuse of financial data and an erosion of personal privacy.
	2.	Overreach and Control
	•	Authorities could freeze accounts, limit spending on certain goods, or impose “expiry dates” on currency, forcing citizens to spend rather than save.
	3.	Financial Exclusion
	•	If poorly designed, a CBDC could disadvantage those without internet access, digital literacy, or compatible devices, deepening inequality.
	4.	Increased Surveillance
	•	A CBDC could be used as a tool for surveillance, allowing governments to track citizens’ spending habits, potentially leading to authoritarian control.
	5.	Destabilization of Traditional Banks
	•	Widespread use of a CBDC might draw deposits away from banks, undermining their ability to lend and destabilizing the broader financial system.
	6.	Economic Coercion
	•	In extreme scenarios, governments could use CBDCs to restrict access to funds or punish dissenting groups by cutting off their financial lifelines.

Is Crypto a Good Way to Pay Citizens?

Pros:
	•	Direct and Fast Payments: Cryptocurrencies enable governments to pay citizens directly and instantly without intermediaries like banks.
	•	Reduced Costs: Lower transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems.
	•	Inclusivity: A CBDC could reach citizens in remote areas or those without traditional bank accounts.
	•	Global Reach: Cross-border payments could be simplified, benefiting expatriates and cross-border workers.

Cons:
	•	Infrastructure Barriers: Many citizens may lack the technology or digital literacy to effectively use cryptocurrency.
	•	Volatility Risks: While CBDCs would likely be pegged to a stable fiat currency, other forms of crypto might suffer from price fluctuations.
	•	Cybersecurity Concerns: Digital wallets could become targets for hackers if security measures are inadequate.

Using a Government-Backed Crypto for Universal Basic Income

A government-backed cryptocurrency could be an effective tool for implementing UBI:
	1.	Automated Distribution
	•	Smart contracts could automatically distribute UBI to citizens’ wallets on a regular basis, ensuring consistency and reliability.
	2.	Targeted Stimulus
	•	A CBDC could allow governments to adjust UBI amounts based on economic conditions, demographics, or regions in need of greater support.
	3.	Global Scalability
	•	Countries could collaborate on international CBDCs, allowing for seamless cross-border UBI for displaced populations or global crises.
	4.	Transparency and Accountability
	•	Every transaction could be publicly recorded (while anonymized), ensuring funds reach their intended recipients without misuse.
	5.	Expiration or Spending Controls
	•	Governments could design UBI payments to expire after a certain period, encouraging spending and stimulating the economy.

Challenges:
	•	Potential for Abuse: Governments might tie UBI to behavioral conditions, such as restricting funds for certain purchases or penalizing dissent.
	•	Dependence on Digital Infrastructure: UBI would require robust systems, and outages or cyberattacks could disrupt the distribution of funds.
	•	Inflation Risks: If not managed carefully, the widespread issuance of UBI in a digital currency could contribute to inflation.

Key Recommendations

To maximize benefits and minimize risks:
	•	Protect Privacy: Ensure that a CBDC respects individual privacy through robust encryption and optional anonymity features.
	•	Promote Accessibility: Develop user-friendly platforms and provide digital literacy training to ensure everyone can participate.
	•	Foster Accountability: Use transparent blockchain technology to track funds while preventing misuse.
	•	Engage Citizens: Involve the public in the design and implementation process to build trust and address concerns.
	•	Mitigate Risks to Banks: Ensure the CBDC is designed to coexist with traditional financial systems, avoiding destabilization.

A government-backed cryptocurrency has immense potential to drive positive change, particularly for implementing universal income and improving financial inclusivity. However, careful design and regulation are critical to prevent misuse and ensure it serves the greater good."

**Solar Farm is currently has the highest rising TVL’s, it’s based around three assets.: BNB, Solar Panels and Power (in Gigawatts). Deposit BNB in exchange for Panels. Your Panels will go to work earning Power. You will earn 14.28% of your Panels per day in the form of watts shown under “Manage Solar Farm”.**

**Daily percentage is up to 14.20%. This depends on claiming habits, time of day you compound or deposit, TVL fluctuation. The contract is written to provide an optimal entry for any and all users, new or old.**

**This is the reason the Panels per BNB amount changes frequently with TVL fluctuation to provide an even playing field for any new user coming to Solar Farm and not giving the first user a head start.**

HOW DOES MINERS WORK?**The way it works is pretty simple - you deposit your funds into the miner rewards pool and you earn daily interest. Your deposit is locked forever and you cannot withdraw it. However, you can always Claim or Compound your pending rewards. You can earn up to 12% Daily depending on the project you decide to invest in.**HOW DOES DEFI WORK?**Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology. It is based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. The system eliminates the control banks and institutions have on our money, financial services, and financial products.**  


[SolarFarmMinerOffical](https://app.solarfarm.finance/?ref=0xC95556dF4535A1C0372D40A8dE0CCAEeeE48c677)

\-

**Quick recap to the overall solution:** 

This automates backing up Reports, Models, and Dataflows across all your workspaces…. extracts the metadata from each…. and outputs a Power BI report that gives an easy all-in-one view of your Power BI environment, how and where you visualize all aspects of your model, and the lineage of your visuals, models, and dataflows.

\-

**Below are the new features since November’s post:**

1️⃣ Semantic Model Refresh History: Monitor semantic model refreshes across all workspaces in one place. 

2️⃣ Table Lineage: view the steps in how all tables are built within a model via Power Query, including dataflow steps, for a complete lineage view.

3️⃣ Full Measure Lineage: See the DAX behind a measure, its dependencies, and every measure impacted by changes.

4️⃣ API Time Limit Handling: Automatically renews connections to avoid expired authorizations during long processes.

\-

**This ‘mostly’ one-click solution is accessible to anyone developing in Power BI—no admin access or elevated permissions required!**

\-

If you have any ideas or feedback to make it better, please send my way - it’ll help everyone who uses it!

Much of me, Captain…” Lord Hirak’s voice was but a whisper, fearful eyes locked onto the red-soaked fabric wrapping Benjamin’s left palm. “And you claim the Queen Mother Victoria knows and vouches for him?”

 

“Ulioorin does. I trust the old SeaMaster with my life, or I would have attempted to dispose of Benjamin long before we arrived.. Had I succeeded, I would also have failed to rescue you, My Lord.” Olioorin answered formally before shifting uncomfortably, “Lord Hirak, there is more… forgive me, but I have come to suspect your uncle’s hand aided in your kidnapping.”

 

To Benjamin’s surprise, Hirak did not react in shock and was about to speak when the door opened, and Veiran entered, fluttering over to Benjamin, and began attending to his hand without so much as a flinch at the sight of red. “You know as well?” Hirak had noticed the same. Veiran simply nodded, never halting her attentions, “I do, Lord Hirak” 

 

Hirak hummed deeply, “So easily, tell me, It is not easy to earn the trust of the Vin. What has this being done to earn such favor.” Veiran froze, it was half a heartbeat, but it was noticed. Benjamin sighed heavily, “It is ok, go ahead.” Veiran nodded, her wings still glowing slightly with her healing aura as she finished sealing Benjamin’s wound. “He… he is blessed, by the goddess. I have seen him wield forbidden power far stronger than any warrior maje from the H’mure wars. I was there, at the end… I can assure you, that if Benjamin was facing us, we may not have prevailed.” 

 

Benjamin inhaled deeply in surprise. Intellectually, he understood that the Vin were functionally immortal, but outside of Vilora and Victoria, he assumed that not many of them had survived until now. Veiran looked up at Benjamin sincerely, “Benjamin, your power is terrifying; and I suspect you are holding back, but you are no H’mure. The treatment of your women alone proves that, but the way you fight is another mark in your ledger. H’mure hold little weight in the worth of a life. Their Majik reflected that, often willingly unleashing their power on friend as well as foe, if the situation would result in their favor. You do not. You take great care to avoid wounding a friend, even while wielding power many would call heretical.” 

 

With that, the Vin healer bowed to Hirak, and departed. “A powerful testament, I...

**Solar Farm is currently has the highest rising TVL’s, it’s based around three assets.: BNB, Solar Panels and Power (in Gigawatts). Deposit BNB in exchange for Panels. Your Panels will go to work earning Power. You will earn 14.28% of your Panels per day in the form of watts shown under “Manage Solar Farm”.**

**Daily percentage is up to 14.20%. This depends on claiming habits, time of day you compound or deposit, TVL fluctuation. The contract is written to provide an optimal entry for any and all users, new or old.**

**This is the reason the Panels per BNB amount changes frequently with TVL fluctuation to provide an even playing field for any new user coming to Solar Farm and not giving the first user a head start.**

HOW DOES MINERS WORK?**The way it works is pretty simple - you deposit your funds into the miner rewards pool and you earn daily interest. Your deposit is locked forever and you cannot withdraw it. However, you can always Claim or Compound your pending rewards. You can earn up to 12% Daily depending on the project you decide to invest in.**HOW DOES DEFI WORK?**Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology. It is based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. The system eliminates the control banks and institutions have on our money, financial services, and financial products.**

I have to first say I really appreciate the mods of this sub for not taking the post down, which is what happened basically everywhere else.

I appreciate the attention that post got, but **I NEED HELP IN ALERTING AS MANY PEOPLE IN POWER AS WE CAN ABOUT THIS** so we can get at the news media and law enforcement to investigate this.

I don't need upvotes, don't need karma, don't need nice pleasant comments (although ty for all that, its really nice of you all).

**I NEED YOU TO REACH OUT TO RELEVANT MEDIA OUTLETS, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND POLITICIANS ABOUT THIS.**

# Media outlets/investigative journalists

D&E Media is headquartered in East Orange, NJ (also has a listed headquarters in South Plainfield, NJ). Reach out to any and every relevant news media outlet you can and copy the email draft I have given you below. If more and more people bug them, they won't be able to ignore it (as they currently seem to be doing now that it's just me).

Hello,

A couple of years ago, [Paul Mulholland wrote an article on Medium](https://paulm989.medium.com/porn-studio-accused-of-ignoring-consent-and-inflicting-injuries-on-models-9f390e2a4a78) detailing extremely violent abuse and racially targeted rape of young women at ""Ghetto Gaggers"", ""FacialAbuse"", (abusive porn sites under parent company D&E Media headquartered in East Orange, NJ).

The article goes into horrifying, graphic abuse of young women, including being brutally abused to the point of vomiting, enduring a bowl of the resulting vomit and urine from male co-stars to be poured on their head, discussing dos/donts pre-shoot and then completely disregarding them. One of the performers featured in these videos is convicted white supremacist Paul Kryscuk.

**I am appalled that not one single news media outlet has reported on this at all.**

It seems like the evidence for this racial and sexual abuse as well as trafficking is overt and online in the form of hundreds of hours of videotape. They themselves brag about their borderline assaults on these women on their websites. How is this company not shut down and the conspirators (Donald Emil Vollenweider, David Bryan Horter, Ernie Rossi) under criminal investigation?

Ownership & Governance  🫶,ClearlightStudios,1i3q6ij,2025-01-17 15:40:55,34,1.0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearlightStudios/comments/1i3q6ij/ownership_governance/,NoWord423,revenue & ownership,"# How Do We Ensure the App Stays in the Hands of the People?

There’s been a lot of discussion around how to ensure this app could never be sold and would always remain in the hands of the people. It’s a critical question because the moment an app like this becomes vulnerable to acquisition by billionaires or corporations, its original mission is at risk.

**So...what if we removed equity entirely?**

# No Equity = No Asset to Buy or Sell

Without equity, there’s no tradable ownership, and therefore, no asset to buy or sell. The app becomes something more like a **public utility**—a tool that belongs to everyone, cannot be taken away, and is immune to the profit motives that dominate most tech platforms.

Initially, I was thinking more along the lines of a **worker’s co-op** (which u/GlassShark has has posted some thoughtful ideas about, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearlightStudios/comments/1i1xvum/worker_cooperative_maybe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) mixed with equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding is where everyday people (you, me, and all our neighbors) invest small amounts to collectively own the platform. And while that sounds democratic, there are some flaws:

1. **Human Nature and Selling Out:** If 30,000 people invested, it would only take 15,001 of them—just over half—to sell their shares to a billionaire. Suddenly, control of the app would shift, and everything we worked for could be destroyed.
2. **Conflict Between Shareholders and Users:** In traditional systems, shareholders often prioritize profits, which can lead to decisions that harm or ignore the user base. Think of how many platforms start out user-friendly, only to become ad-saturated or exploitative as shareholder interests take over.

By **removing equity entirely**, we eliminate those risks. But this introduces a new challenge: **governance.**

# Governance Without Equity

The solution is to **put control back in the hands of the users.** Imagine a true, direct democracy where **every decision about the platform is made collectively**:

* No middlemen.
* No conflict between what users want and what shareholders demand.
* A system where the app truly belongs to the people who use it.

This kind of governance hasn’t been feasible before—but now it is. **Blockchain technology** is the missing piece that makes this possible for the first time in modern history.

# Republic vs. Democracy: Why This Matters

To understand why this approach is revolutionary (and so appropriate for the times), it helps to clarify the difference between a republic and a democracy:

* **Republic:** A system where people elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The U.S. is a **constitutional republic**, meaning we elect officials to represent us, but those officials often act in their own interests—or in the interests of corporations and lobbyists—rather than the will of the people.
* **Democracy:** A system where every individual votes directly on decisions. For example, in a true democracy, all 300 million Americans would directly vote **yes** or **no** on whether to go to war. 

But we aren't a democracy. We aren't even really a republic anymore. Because in reality, the U.S. has mutated from a constitutional republic to what many describe as an **oligarchy**—a system where power is concentrated in the hands of a wealthy few.   
  
True democracy has never been achievable at scale because of **logistical and technological barriers.** But with blockchain, this changes.

# Why Blockchain Makes True Democracy Possible

Blockchain solves the major issues that have prevented true democracy:

1. **Scalability:** Blockchain can securely handle millions or billions of votes.
2. **Transparency:** Every vote is recorded on a tamper-proof ledger, ensuring trust and accountability.
3. **Decentralization:** Decisions are made collectively, not controlled by a central authority.
4. **Real-Time Participation:** People can engage in governance without delays or intermediaries.

(Also waxing real big picture here for a moment...this isn’t just a better way to run an app—it’s a small-scale blueprint to test out how societies could function in the future. And, synergetically and synchronistically, u/11WordsofWisdom11 has already put some considerable thought into what something like this looks like, [thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearlightStudios/comments/1i1cs9z/comment/m77v4ab/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)).

# More than a Social Media App; A Precedent

Yes, designing this kind of governance system will be challenging, but if we can get it right on this platform, it could set a powerful precedent for tech, venture, and beyond. 

**Imagine if countries adopted a system like this. We’d have world peace overnight.**   
  
Why? Because the overwhelming majority of everyday people would never vote to send their loved ones to die for wars driven by lies, profit, and power.  
  
It’s not people who hate each other—it’s governments. Look at the cultural exchange happening with the Red Note migration. It’s warm, hilarious, and deeply human. Chinese and Americans are quickly becoming friends across borders. And that's because the issue is never between people; it's always between our governments, who fail to represent us. 

If we nail down a governance model that works here, it could show what's possible with blockchain technology."

Crypto 101: Cryptocurrency Essentials Explained,thelucrefoundation,1i3krx2,2025-01-17 11:50:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelucrefoundation/comments/1i3krx2/crypto_101_cryptocurrency_essentials_explained/,richlucre,,"**Introduction:**  
Welcome to the first post in our *Crypto 101* series! Today, we’re taking a deep dive into the fascinating world of cryptocurrency—a revolutionary concept reshaping finance and technology. Whether you’re interested in investing, exploring blockchain applications, or simply curious about this trending topic, understanding cryptocurrency is essential in today’s rapidly evolving digital economy.

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a clear grasp of the fundamentals and be ready to start your journey into crypto with confidence.

**Section 1: What is Cryptocurrency?**  
Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency designed to function as a medium of exchange. The word “crypto” refers to the cryptographic techniques used to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Unlike physical money, cryptocurrencies exist only in digital form and are powered by innovative technology.

What sets cryptocurrency apart from traditional currency?

1. **Decentralization**: Most cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, meaning no single authority (like a bank or government) controls them. This independence ensures that cryptocurrencies remain free from interference.
2. **Transparency**: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, accessible to anyone, ensuring accountability.
3. **Limited Supply**: Many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have a capped supply, protecting them from inflation.

Popular examples include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB), each serving unique purposes in the ecosystem.

**Section 2: Why is Cryptocurrency Important?**  
Cryptocurrency has gained global attention because it offers solutions to many challenges faced by traditional financial systems.

Here’s why crypto is making waves:

* **Financial Inclusion**: Crypto empowers individuals without access to traditional banking services by providing a digital wallet and direct access to financial tools.
* **Faster Transactions**: Cross-border payments that used to take days can now happen in minutes, often at a fraction of the cost.
* **Ownership and Control**: Unlike traditional banks, which hold your funds, cryptocurrencies allow you to have full ownership and control over your digital assets.
* **Innovation**: Blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies, is driving advancements in industries like supply chain management, healthcare, and gaming.

Cryptocurrencies are more than just digital money—they represent a new era of decentralized finance (DeFi) that eliminates intermediaries and democratizes financial systems.

**Section 3: What is Blockchain Technology?**  
Blockchain is the revolutionary technology that makes cryptocurrency possible. At its core, a blockchain is a distributed ledger or database that records all transactions across a network of computers in a secure and tamper-proof way.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Blocks and Chains**: Data is grouped into blocks, which are linked together in chronological order to form a chain. Each block contains a record of transactions.
2. **Decentralization**: Instead of being stored on a single server, the blockchain is maintained by a network of participants, ensuring no single point of failure.
3. **Security**: Cryptographic techniques secure the data, making it nearly impossible to alter or hack.

Blockchain’s transparency and immutability are why it’s trusted for uses beyond cryptocurrency, like voting systems, supply chain tracking, and smart contracts.

**Section 4: Getting Started with Cryptocurrency**  
Ready to enter the crypto world? Here’s how to begin:

1. **Choose a Digital Wallet**: A digital wallet is where you store your cryptocurrency. There are two main types:
   * **Hot Wallets**: Connected to the internet for quick access (e.g., mobile or web wallets).
   * **Cold Wallets**: Offline storage options (e.g., hardware wallets) that offer higher security.
2. **Select a Cryptocurrency Exchange**: These platforms allow you to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Popular exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.
3. **Start Small**: Begin with a small investment while you learn the ropes. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
4. **Prioritize Security**: Always use two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts, and never share your private keys.

While the crypto market can be volatile, proper research and cautious investing can minimize risks and maximize rewards.

**Section 5: Conclusion and Next Steps**  
Now that you’ve learned the essentials of cryptocurrency, it’s time to take the next step. Explore different cryptocurrencies, understand their unique use cases, and experiment with small transactions to build your confidence.

In our upcoming *Crypto 101* posts, we’ll cover topics like how to analyze cryptocurrencies, understanding DeFi, and the role of NFTs. Stay curious, stay informed, and start building your crypto journey today!

**Key Takeaways:**

* Cryptocurrency is digital, decentralized, and powered by blockchain.
* It offers financial independence, faster transactions, and global innovation.
* Blockchain ensures security, transparency, and trust in the crypto ecosystem.
* Start your crypto journey with a secure wallet, trusted exchange, and small investments.

**Chapter 25**

•Pancheck states in his memoir that there are no plans to invade enemy territory, but if there were, he suggests targeting Zolya as the first target as that is where Cliffsbane Academy is located and take Cliffsbane out, you take out years worth of gryphon fliers. 

•Caroline Ashton asks how 2nd Squad escaped. They don’t tell her. 

•Tairn felt Sgaeyl get *very* angry last night. 

•Is Pancheck venin? Or working with them? Associated with them in some way? Or did the venin have the same thought as he? Zolya has fallen to *blue dragon fire* (wyvern) with an estimated 10,000 lives lost. Including General Fenella, commander of Braevick’s gryphon fleet. All trade routes to the city have been barricaded. 

•Violet suspects Devera is good. 

•The ink on the leaflet smears so these handouts are fresh. 

•Markham says something to Caroline and she jumps up, leaving class. Wonder who she’s running after? 😒 

•Devera pockets her leaflet. 

•Markham takes away the handouts before discrediting them. Instead of mentioning blue flame dragons, he says blue dragons. It’s close enough to the truth that people would see how they could mess it up. 

•And our favorite character has returned! Jack Barlowe is oh so graciously back in the RQ. Yay. 😀 

**Chapter 26**

•Healers are bound to the Code of Chricton and are to do no harm. Menders are riders and they are bound by the Codex. They can and they do, harm. 

•Yesterday evening, there was an unprecedented attack on one of Navarre’s largest outposts (Samara) and one rider was severely wounded (Xaden). 

•Devera’s eyes snap to Violet when she relays that last bit of information. 

**Chapter 27**

•Riders can be controlled by their dragon’s emotions if the rider doesn’t learn how to shield properly. 

•There has been an increase in security in Samara due to the attack. 

•According to Mira, Xaden is the reason Samara still has an outpost. 

•I love how before they leave the bathing chambers, Xaden makes a point of getting Violet into his flight jacket so she doesn’t use Bodhi’s again. 😂

**Chapter 28**

•Gryphon riders cannot produce signets but have honed lesser magic, especially mindwork. 

•Who is Garion Savoy? 

•Tairn instructs Violet not to dismount once they land in Poromiel. 

•Does Xaden have bad dreams about Resson and losing Violet? 🥺

•Oh yay, we get to meet Cat. 🙃

•Xaden was injured because he hesitated thinking he may know the gryphon flier that attacked him at Samara. 

•Xaden threatens to cease weapon shipments if the Poromish continue invading and risk weakening the wards. 

•If venin reach Basgiath’s hatching grounds, the raw magic there would be enough for Venin to feed off them for centuries. 

**Chapter 29**

•Violet gets angry with Xaden later on about not telling her about his engagement to Cat but…he offers to talk about it and she shoots it down. Though he did deliberately avoid using the word when she initially asked. Which feeds into *both* of their points— she isn’t asking the right questions but he isn’t offering full-disclosure when she does ask a question. He’s beating around the bush whereas she’s avoiding going too deep. 

•Xaden is repetitious in his declaration that he would rather lose the war than lose Violet…will it ever actually come down to that? Will he have to choose between Aretia and Violet at some point? 

•Xaden admits to having bad dreams. 🥺 He gives Violet an imbued dagger. 

•Violet states that if she can get her hands on the signet-blocking elixir, her or Brennan could likely find an antidote. 

•I *love* Emetterio in this moment. Though he *definitely* does not have a favorite student. At all. 

•Violet begins to panic and gestures to Rhi to help her. 

•Violet proves to be more knowledgeable regarding what the Codex says compared to Varrish. 

•Kaori sticks up for Violet. 

•Kaori accuses Varrish of abusing power. 

•Kaori has already reported to Pancheck about Violet so that she is cleared of departing without leave. -Is Kaori aware of what Varrish is after/his intentions involving Violet? 

•Varrish is venin. He has to be. He says he does not bow to the whims of his dragon but rather *influences* him. 

•Kaori suggests that Varrish influenced his dragon to set fire to third squad of bonded riders. A scorching that almost killed Violet. 

•*Rhiannon summons Violet’s dagger through the wall*. A feat she couldn’t do until now. 

•Violet tells Rhiannon, Ridoc, and Sawyer about the venin. 

**Chapter 30**

•Only riders and designated scribes are permitted into the RQ. Others who enter without invitation will be killed. 

•Why such a harsh welcome? 

•Violet tells them about what happened in Resson but does not speak on Brennan or Aretia. 

•Rhiannon and Ridoc’s dragons are surprised that they and Violet know about venin. 

•Violet tells them that the Empyrean is split on whether to act or not and that the dragons don’t want to risk informing their rider unless the rider already knows. 

•Sawyer states that living in Luceras, the only news they received came from the scribes that put out official announcements. They aren’t even open to trading vessels from the isle kingdoms. 

•Ridoc initially struggles to believe leadership would/could hide news this book. 

•Violet tells Rhiannon she needs to tell her family to move as far away from the border as possible. 

•Ridoc is so proud to know something about the Archives that Violet doesn’t. 😂

•Ridcoc read a classified ledger in General Sorrengail’s office last year  during Squad Battle stating that Lyra’s and Warrick’s journals are in the Archives in a sublevel vault. 

•Violet doesn’t know that there are sublevel vaults in the Archives. 

•Jack is suddenly being nice to everyone. 

•Violet told Imogen that her friends know about venin which led Imogen to tell Quinn. 

•Visia bonded a brown daggertail. 

•Aaric bonds a blue clubtail. Second royalty member with a blue dragon. First Xaden now Cam/Aaric. 

•Salome bonds a red daggertail just like Liam did. 🥹

•The academic wing is oddly empty when Violet goes up to begin her watch duty. 

•Four infantry cadets rush out of the doorway stating they have express permission to be in the RQ to deliver a message: secrets die with the people who keep them. 

•Eya is killed and Violet almost falls from the roof. 

**Chapter 31**

•Damnit, don’t make me laugh Jack! I don’t like you! 

•Why did Jack come running? He says he heard someone scream while on dorm watch for First Wing  but Jack in FW would have laughed and sat there. Is it strictly because he’s been instructed to keep Violet alive (I’m assuming he has been told this)?

•Ridoc comes to the tower after meeting with Jesinia who said she knows where the vault is but it requires someone of King Tauri’s bloodline to get in. 

**Chapter 32**

•Why are Ridoc and Sawyer creeping outside Violet’s door? 😂 

•Xaden admits to having killed Aric’s brother, Alic. And Xaden being Xaden…say she couldn’t care less. I wonder if Alic was his first kill? 

•The only person Aric hates more than Xaden is his own father. So….thats comforting. I guess. 

•Nasya is asleep again. Is this on purpose? Are they just that bad at his Archives duty or is someone poisoning him? 

•Xaden is capable of almost disappearing completely into shadows. 

•Jesinia and Nasya are the only two on Archives duty. 

**Chapter 33**

•The complex magics in place to preserve the Archive’s texts are not compatible with life. 
Ironic that their lives weren’t compatible with texts…so the texts were destroyed. 

•Xaden calls out to Violet just as Aaric grabs her to pull her into the warded vault. 

•King Tauri doesn’t ward anything that is worth shoving off according to Aaric. 

•Knot-like lines are carved into the decorative ceiling of the vault. Runes? 

•Who informed Aaric of Alic’s death? Xaden says if the king knew, Xaden wouldn’t still be alive. So how does Aaric know? 

•Violet comes across two books: The Study of Winged Creatures and A History of the Island Wars. Are either of these two books going to come into play in the future? Or at her very least hinting at what is to come in our storyline? 

•Healers, infantry, and scribes could all be General of the Armies until about 200 years ago with the second Krovlan uprising. After that, the commander of the riders commanded all Navarre forces. 

•Imogen states that no rider has ever been named king but Violet starts to contradict her until Aaric interrupts. 

•Halden knows about what is happening behind the wards and isn’t doing anything to help. 

•Violet is reciting from the Scribe Manual while Aaric talks about how he once heard her recite the entire unification agreement while climbing the battlements in Calldyr. 

•Aaric doesn’t hate marked ones. He agrees with them and what their parents did. He hates Xaden for the death of Alic. 

•Aaric starts guessing at where Violet and them are trying to establish wards. He guesses Draithus as it is the most logical choice as it is close to the Navarrian border and the sea. 

•Aaric reaches through the protective wards to grab the journals and leaves with blisters coating every inch of skin that went through. 

•Xaden declares that if Violet gets stuck in the Archives, he does, too. 🥹

**Chapter 34**

•The last words Xaden spoke to his father were in anger as his father sent him away for his own safety. Xaden has not forgiven himself for that but likes to think his father would have forgiven him. 

•Violet tells Ridoc to take Aaric to his room and for Rhi to grab Dyre as he owes her a favor? Why does he owe her? 

•Quinn can project as multiple people. She can also distort her own features a little. Her signet is stronger because Cruth was her great-aunt’s dragon. 

•Violet gives Xaden Warrick’s journal to take back to Brennan. 

•Nolon poisons Violet stating he doesn’t like to see her hurt but he will do what must be done in order to keep Navarre and its citizens safe. 

**Chapter 35**

•Major Afendra states that the only signet more terrifying than an inntinnsic is a truth sayer, yet they’re allowed to live. 

•Lilith is currently in Calldyr and isn’t slotted to return for another week. 

•”Clear this up quickly and we can return to treating each other”. Fuck that Nolon, you drug me one time and put me at the mercy of Varrish???? That trust would be gone quicker than Dylan’s death off parapet. 

•It is not outright stated that Nora is a truth sayer, only that she can detect lies. 

•Hi, Liam. 🥺

•Liam is a reflection of Violet’s subconscious. Is telling her was she really needs. Violet’s logical side declares he won’t know she’s missing for another five days when she doesn’t show in Samara. But Liam (Violet’s subconscious) asks if she really thinks he isn’t out there losing his shit. She needs Xaden, and deep down knows that he would do anything for her. Included rescuing her from the brig. 

•Varrish can see one’s weaknesses with his signet. Varrish expected to see pain when he met Violet. Pain from broken bones and shame from never living up to her mother’s expectations. But he didn’t see anything because of her excelling in shielding. 

•Now that she has been cut off from her power she has no shields and he can see the people she loves are her weakness. 

•Varrish witnessed Xaden fumble his shields once. When? In chapter 22 when him and Violet were speaking through their bond? 

•Xaden is who Varrish is really after. Violet is just the tool to get to him. 

•Why would they bring Jack in to interrogate Violet? 

•Jack has been oh so nice since his resurrection but Nora and Varrish state that he is starving for retribution against Violet. 

•Xaden deserted his post days ago. 

•”I make no such promises.” Our favorite shadow daddy coming to save the day. 🥳 

**Chapter 36**

•Is…is Xaden crying? 🥺

•How is Xaden speaking to Violet through the bond? Is this his signet coming into play? Continuity error? Can he speak to her because he’s physically close? 

•Violet’s squad was put under guard in the interrogation classroom for trying to mount a rescue mission for her. 

•Violet’s hallucination of Liam is forgotten then later fades as Xaden comes in. She is no longer in need of her dead protector, but has her living one by her side who *finally* told her how he feels about her. 

•Lilith pulls out the antidote to the signet blocking serum she just oh so happened to be carrying around. 

•Xaden left Samara to hunt down wyvern and kill them just to have them dropped along the borders forcing leadership to evacuate in an attempt to contain the problem so he could save Violet. 

•Markham daughter after Violet not just because of her wit, but because he figured her to be easy to manipulate. She would be the one to weave the lies long after he was gone. Lilith knows her daughter and knew Violet would never do such a think…so the RQ it was. 

•Xaden wanted the marked ones to have a chance after the execution of their parents. They would have been dead otherwise. Not just marked physically but figuratively as well. He went to Lilith to give the marked ones a chance in exchange for whatever favor Lilith may need at a future date. Violet became that favor. The marked ones entered the RQ and Xaden protected Violet against others and herself her first year. 

•Markham is still in Calldyr. What is happening there that her and Markham have been there for several days? 

•Lilith states that Violet is all that is left of her father. 

•The Empyrean has decided to leave it up to the individual dragon whether they tell their respective rider or not. Dragons will not interfere nor will they punish those who choose to leave and their clutches and hatchlings with them. 

•Tairn lost Solas in a network of caves whilst he was hunting him. 

•In the last five days, Xaden gathered every graduate who bears a rebellion relic and a good share of their classmates. 

•Carr attempts to stop them with his signet which Bodhi counteracts. Devera steps up and says they won’t stop them from leaving and have actually been waiting to join them. 

•Devera is the one who left the Zolya pamphlets in Battle Brief. "
