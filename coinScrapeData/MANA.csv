I've traded mana but never really gotten into the ecosystem.

My career background is a bit of a mix between engineering, fabricating/maker stuff, and archtiecture. I've worked for big firms primarily running 3d printers, cnc machines, laser cutters, and VR googles for client presentations. I just got a job teaching VR/AR rendering at a local university of applied sciences and thats gotten me to wonder....

With all of this talk about AI agents, crypto, the digital world becoming a paralell and ideas like decentraland - I'm wondering if I can translate these Architecture and rendering skills into some asset dev that might be a nice side hustle. 

Does anyone have any resources about doing this sort of thing? are there people who dev assets for VR and the crypto community full time? no idea how to take this seriously but figured this wouldn't be the worst place to ask"

# üí° My Strategy and Considerations

* **No Bitcoin Exposure:**¬†I'm a big fan of Bitcoin but decided not to invest while it's under $50k. Instead, I've focused on altcoins with the intention to sell my holdings in 12 months and then reinvest in Bitcoin. I believe this long-term strategy might help stabilize my portfolio after a period of growth.
* **Amateur Investor:**¬†Being new to crypto, I've adjusted my portfolio multiple times as I learn more about different projects and market trends. My aim is to balance between high-risk altcoins for growth and some stability by holding larger projects like ETH and ADA. However, I'm still getting to know most of the projects in my portfolio.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights, especially since I'm still learning about many of the projects I hold.

* 3.NFT Integration: Coins with utility tied to NFTs or digital assets in games (e.g., Karrat) will likely see increased demand.

# New:  Example of what to project for the next bull run. How a new gaming crypto Karrat Might Compare. There are many new coins in the gaming ecosystem!

# If Karrat follows similar growth trajectories:

* \-	Current Price: \~$0.50.
* \-	Speculative Peak Price: $10‚Äì$30.
* \-	Market Cap Implication: $3‚Äì9 billion (assuming \~300M circulating supply by 2025).

Karrat‚Äôs growth potential depends heavily on the success of \*My Pet Hooligan\* and the adoption of AMGI‚Äôs broader ecosystem, including Studio Chain and NFT integration.

# Conclusion:

Gaming tokens in the next bull run could experience significant growth, but their performance will hinge on real utility, adoption, and timing. Coins tied to strong gaming ecosystems or major narratives (like NFTs and metaverse) are positioned to outperform speculative projects. If history repeats or rhymes, coins like Karrat and others in the gaming sector could see explosive growth, particularly during the final stages of the bull market. üöÄ

Crypto History: Gaming Timeline for the 2021 Bull Run,KARRATCRYPTO,1heic5d,2024-12-14 20:57:49,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1heic5d/crypto_history_gaming_timeline_for_the_2021_bull/,tracksta6,,"In the 2020‚Äì2021 bull run, specific cryptocurrency genres (e.g., meme coins, gaming coins, DeFi tokens) experienced surges of interest at different times. These shifts were driven by evolving market narratives, trends, and hype cycles. Here‚Äôs an analysis of when each genre gained major inflows of capital:

https://preview.redd.it/as32vw0t5x6e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c862be8aa72bf4354664f5f98b5d0f9c9a208d7

>**1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - Initial Surge: Mid-2020**

* The DeFi boom began in summer 2020, often referred to as ""DeFi Summer.""
* Key drivers included platforms like Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP), and [Yearn.Finance](http://Yearn.Finance) (YFI), which introduced yield farming and liquidity mining.
* DeFi tokens dominated attention from mid-2020 to early 2021 as users chased high returns and DeFi total value locked (TVL) surged.

>

>**2. Gaming and Metaverse Coins - nitial Surge: Mid-2021**

* Gaming and metaverse tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (MANA) gained traction during Q2‚ÄìQ3 2021.
* Axie Infinity drove the narrative with its play-to-earn (P2E) model, which saw rapid adoption in emerging markets.
* The metaverse hype reached its peak in late 2021, fueled by Facebook‚Äôs rebranding to Meta in October 2021.

>

>**3. Meme Coin** \-  Initial Surge: Early 2021

* Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged in popularity during Q1‚ÄìQ2 2021.
* Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets and the broader retail investor craze (e.g., Reddit-driven pumps) contributed to the explosive growth of DOGE, which peaked in May 2021.
* SHIB followed in Q2‚ÄìQ3 2021, fueled by its community-driven growth and listing on major exchanges.

>

>**4. Layer-1 Protocols**

* Initial Surge: Late 2020 to Early 2021
* Layer-1 tokens like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) saw significant inflows as Ethereum faced scalability issues.
* From late 2020 through Q3 2021, investors sought alternatives to Ethereum, driving the growth of competing blockchains.

>

>**5. NFT -  Initial Surge: Q1‚ÄìQ2 2021**

* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in early 2021, driven by projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and major auctions like Beeple‚Äôs $69M NFT sale in March 2021.
* The NFT craze aligned closely with the gaming/metaverse hype in Q3‚ÄìQ4 2021, expanding into broader cultural and entertainment sectors.

>

* **6. Privacy Coins -  Initial Surge: Early to Mid-2021**
* Coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) saw renewed interest in Q1 2021, as concerns about regulatory scrutiny and privacy grew during the bull run.
* This genre's surge was smaller compared to others but aligned with broader crypto adoption.

>Observations and Takeaways:

>Rotational Capital:

1.  Money rotated through genres as the market narratives shifted.
2.   Early adopters of each genre benefited the most as capital inflows surged.
3.   Gaming as a Late-Stage Winner: Gaming and metaverse coins often peaked later in the cycle, especially during the altcoin season after Bitcoin and Ethereum had their major runs
4.    Meme Coins Thrive on Hype: Meme coins tend to surge during periods of retail euphoria, often spurred by social media campaigns.
5.    DeFi Pioneered the Bull Run: DeFi projects laid the groundwork for mainstream crypto adoption in mid-2020, establishing foundational protocols.

Looking Forward to the Next Bull Run - If historical patterns repeat, gaming/metaverse tokens like Karrat could see their major inflows in the latter stages of the next bull run, likely around Q3‚ÄìQ4 2025. Meme coins and NFTs might see earlier retail-driven pumps, while DeFi and Layer-1s could kickstart the cycle.

What is an utility token?,CapitalistExploits,1h4ugpk,2024-12-02 08:02:37,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1h4ugpk/what_is_an_utility_token/,kayakero,,"The tokenization of assets is rapidly changing the reality of the investment world. And, in the midst of this new reality, questions arise about what each type of asset is.

In this article we delve into utility tokens: what are they and how do they work?

# What are utility tokens?

Utility tokens are¬†a form of digital asset that represents future access to a product or service provided by a specific blockchain network. Utility tokens are therefore nothing more than a specialized way of representing digital assets, which allow access to a variety of products and services within a blockchain.

Unlike other digital assets such as a¬†security token¬†or a stablecoin, whose value can be backed by physical assets or fiat currency, respectively,¬†utility tokens do not have a direct backing and their value is intrinsically linked to the utility they offer within the¬†blockchain network or platform for which they were created.

Typically, these tokens operate in parallel with the blockchain's native currency. For example, on the Ethereum network, the native currency is ETH or Ether, while utility tokens such as DAI or MKR (part of the MakerDAO ecosystem) offer access to exclusive products and services within that network.

# How do utility tokens work?

Utility tokens operate within a specific digital ecosystem, where they can be used to access exclusive services, products, or features within that platform. For example, a utility token can allow access to premium features of an application, the acquisition of goods or services within a digital marketplace, or even participation in the governance of a decentralized network.

The value of a utility token is determined by the demand and supply within its ecosystem, as well as the perceived utility it provides to users. As adoption and usage of the platform increases, the value of the utility token can increase, providing growth opportunities for investors who are betting on a specific blockchain ecosystem.

With the increasing adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, utility tokens are going to play a very important role in the future of finance and technology.

# Types of utility tokens

Although there is no clear categorization by use, utility tokens could be classified into several types depending on their function and utility within the platforms or networks for which they were created. Here are some common types of utility tokens:

* **Access or membership tokens:**¬†These tokens grant users access to premium features, exclusive services, or special content within a platform or network. For example, they may provide access to advanced features in an app, exclusive content on a digital media platform, or membership in an online community.
* **Operational utility tokens:**¬†These tokens are used as a medium of exchange within a network or platform to pay for goods, services, or transactions. For example, they can be used to pay transaction fees (such as Ether, the currency within the Ethereum ecosystem), data storage costs, or cloud computing services.
* **Governance Tokens:**¬†These tokens give holders the right to participate in the decision-making and governance process of a decentralized network or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Holders of these tokens can vote on proposals for changes to the protocol, elections of administrators, or important decisions related to the direction of the project. These tokens are already considered a separate category, since although they are utility-granting tokens, their utility is¬†
* **Utility-specific tokens:**¬†These tokens have a specific utility within a particular context, such as tokens that represent access rights to digital resources such as storage, bandwidth, or computing power. For example, they can be used to access distributed storage services, distributed computing, or decentralized network services.
* **Incentive Tokens:**¬†These tokens are used to incentivize and reward certain behaviors or contributions within a platform or network. For example, they can be used to reward users for participating in activities such as content creation, transaction validation, or contributing to the growth and development of the network.

# Advantages of investing in utility tokens

Including utility tokens in an investment portfolio can offer a number of benefits. Here are some of them:

* **Diversification:**¬†Utility tokens can provide exposure to emerging sectors and technologies within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, helping to diversify portfolio risk.
* **Growth potential:**¬†By investing in promising projects backed by utility tokens, investors can benefit from the growth potential of new technologies and innovative business models.
* **Access to exclusive opportunities:**¬†By owning utility tokens, investors can access exclusive features or participate in special events within the platforms or networks they are involved in.

# Risks of utility tokens

However, while utility tokens can be a valuable tool for financing projects in development, their use entails certain significant risks, mainly linked to the fact that they are digital assets created by and for a specific project.

In fact, in 2017, during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom, these utility tokens reached their peak of popularity, as part of the investment in blockchain projects. The main problem is that many cryptocurrency projects promised unrealistic goals, added to the fact that these utility tokens operated in an unregulated space (something that is slowly changing, for example with regulations such as MiCA).

This lack of oversight resulted in lost investments for many stakeholders and utility token holders, especially when projects failed to meet their funding goals or failed to offer real utility.

It should be noted that¬†utility tokens, outside of a blockchain project, have no value. The value lies in the value of the project itself and the network economies it generates.

Each type of utility token serves a specific function within its digital ecosystem and can offer different participation and investment opportunities for users and investors, as they can be exchanged within a specific blockchain network.

It is therefore important to understand the nature and utility of each type of token when considering its potential as part of a specific digital asset investment strategy.¬†

**Some examples of utility tokens are:**

* **Filecoin or Sia**:¬†They allow their holders to digitally store their data on remote computers¬†
* **Golem**:¬†Allows you to rent computing power¬†
* **MANA**:¬†It is the native token of Decentraland, an important metaverse¬†
* **SAND and AXIE**:¬†Used for transactions and interactions in the web3 gaming ecosystem¬†
* **Cronos (CRO)**:¬†It is a cryptocurrency that can be used for payments, trading and blockchains.¬†

Today, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the backbone of countless blockchain-based applications. Whether you‚Äôre new to crypto or looking to deepen your understanding, this comprehensive guide to Ethereum will break down everything you need to know about this revolutionary innovation.

# The Basics of Ethereum

# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily designed as a digital currency and store of value, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain with broader applications.

Launched in 2015 by a group of developers led by¬†[Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.eth.limo/categories/general.html), Ethereum‚Äôs primary objective was to go beyond simple digital payments. By introducing a platform that enables complex applications, Ethereum paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other innovations in the blockchain space.

# Who Created Ethereum?

https://preview.redd.it/eyhsvinuo03e1.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6355f150b898031d8f52ac0873fdc1d1fb1818

Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and crypto enthusiast who was actively involved in the Bitcoin community. Vitalik‚Äôs vision for a more flexible and programmable blockchain led to the conceptualization of Ethereum. He collaborated with several other co-founders, including Gavin Wood, who created Ethereum‚Äôs programming language Solidity, and Joseph Lubin, who later founded ConsenSys, a major Ethereum development firm.

The Ethereum whitepaper, published by Buterin in 2013, outlined the concept of a blockchain capable of running decentralized applications and executing smart contracts. After a successful crowdsale in 2014, Ethereum officially launched on July 30, 2015.

# The Difference Between Ethereum and Bitcoin

# Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Purpose

Bitcoin and Ethereum often get compared due to their market positions, but they serve distinct purposes. Bitcoin is primarily designed as a digital store of value‚Äîoften referred to as ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù Its main objective is to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, focusing on security and immutability.

On the other hand, Ethereum was designed to be a world computer. It provides a decentralized platform for running code and applications, allowing developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications, from financial services to digital art marketplaces.

# Technological Differences

The key technological difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum lies in their scripting abilities. Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting language is deliberately limited, focusing on maintaining a secure and immutable record of transactions. Ethereum, however, uses a Turing-complete language that enables developers to create complex smart contracts capable of automating tasks and managing assets programmatically.

# Market Position and Utility

Bitcoin‚Äôs utility lies in its role as a digital currency and store of value. It‚Äôs widely accepted and held by individuals, institutions, and governments. Ethereum, on the other hand, functions as a platform for the entire decentralized ecosystem, hosting applications that range from DeFi protocols to NFTs. While Bitcoin‚Äôs value is tied to its role in financial transactions and as a hedge against inflation, Ethereum‚Äôs value is linked to the utility of its blockchain and the applications running on it.

# How Does Ethereum Work?

# The Ethereum Blockchain

The Ethereum blockchain functions as a global, decentralized platform for executing smart contracts and running decentralized applications (DApps). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum operates on a distributed ledger technology, where a network of nodes collectively maintains and validates a record of all transactions. However, Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain goes beyond simple peer-to-peer currency transfers, introducing a programmable layer that allows for a wide range of applications to be built on top of it.

At its core, Ethereum is a decentralized network that follows the same basic principles as Bitcoin, ensuring that no central authority controls the data or network operations. Each node stores a copy of the entire Ethereum blockchain, which contains all historical transaction data and smart contracts. When a transaction or smart contract is executed, nodes work together to validate the transaction and reach a consensus on its state, updating the blockchain accordingly.

Ethereum‚Äôs block time, the period it takes to create a new block, is typically around 12 to 15 seconds, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 10-minute block time. This faster block creation rate allows Ethereum to process more transactions per second, although it still faces limitations regarding scalability, which are being addressed with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and Layer 2 solutions.

# Smart Contracts Explained

https://preview.redd.it/wegemctwo03e1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a7e776cdccd7d9790e51393e5b3d83008b84a8

One of Ethereum‚Äôs most revolutionary features is its support for smart contracts. A smart contract is essentially a self-executing code that enforces an agreement or set of rules without needing intermediaries. These contracts are written in Solidity, Ethereum‚Äôs native programming language, which is Turing-complete, meaning it can perform a wide variety of computations.

Smart contracts are stored on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and transparent. Once deployed, they automatically execute the conditions written in their code. For instance, a simple smart contract could facilitate an escrow service, where funds are automatically released to a seller once the buyer confirms receipt of goods. The potential applications are nearly limitless, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that allow users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies to complex supply chain tracking systems.

The execution of smart contracts is validated by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which runs the code on every node in the network. This ensures that smart contracts produce the same result regardless of which node executes them, establishing a universal standard for DApps.

# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the heart of the Ethereum network. It acts as a runtime environment for executing smart contracts and deploying decentralized applications. The EVM is Turing-complete, which means it can handle complex instructions and perform nearly any computation that a traditional computer can execute.

What makes the EVM particularly significant is its universality. Developers can write smart contracts and DApps in various programming languages, including Solidity, Vyper, and others, and the EVM will execute them consistently across all Ethereum nodes. This consistent execution is crucial for ensuring the integrity and reliability of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.

The EVM also plays a key role in calculating gas fees, as it determines the computational resources needed to execute transactions and smart contracts. This standardization of execution and fees enables developers to create diverse applications on a secure and scalable platform.

# Gas and Fees

Every transaction or smart contract executed on Ethereum requires computational power, which is quantified in units of gas. Gas is the fuel that drives the Ethereum network, enabling it to execute transactions and run DApps. When a user initiates a transaction or deploys a smart contract, they must pay a gas fee in Ether (ETH), which incentivizes miners or validators to include their transaction in a block.

The amount of gas required for a transaction depends on its complexity. Simple transactions, such as transferring Ether between wallets, require minimal gas. In contrast, more complex operations like executing a DeFi trade or deploying an NFT contract consume significantly more gas. Users can also set their gas prices, with higher gas prices offering faster transaction confirmations during periods of high network congestion.

Gas fees have been a significant challenge for Ethereum, especially during periods of high demand. When the network experiences congestion, gas prices can skyrocket, leading to prohibitively expensive transactions. To address these issues, Ethereum developers have introduced various scaling solutions and upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 technologies such as¬†[arbitrum](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/arb/).

# Ether (ETH) as Ethereum‚Äôs Native Cryptocurrency

# What is Ether?

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as the lifeblood of the entire ecosystem. While many people think of Bitcoin when they hear the term ‚Äúcryptocurrency,‚Äù Ether plays a fundamentally different role. It‚Äôs not just a digital currency, but the fuel that powers the execution of smart contracts and transactions within the Ethereum network.

Ether‚Äôs importance goes beyond its monetary value. It‚Äôs required to perform any action on the Ethereum blockchain, from deploying a new smart contract to sending a simple transaction. This makes Ether essential for all activities that occur on the Ethereum blockchain, earning it the title of ‚Äúgas‚Äù within the network‚Äôs ecosystem.

**How Ether is Used?**

Ether has multiple use cases within the Ethereum network, and each of them contributes to the overall utility of the cryptocurrency:

* **Paying for Gas Fees**: Every interaction with the Ethereum blockchain requires computing resources, which are paid for in Ether. This includes deploying smart contracts, executing functions within a contract, transferring tokens, and more. The cost of these computational tasks is denominated in gas, which users pay for using Ether. The gas system helps prioritize and allocate resources within the Ethereum network, incentivizing miners to process transactions based on the amount of gas fees offered.

* **Staking**: With the transition to Ethereum 2.0,¬†[ETH holders can stake their tokens](https://blog.netcoins.com/how-to-stake-ethereum-in-canada-a-comprehensive-guide-to-eth-staking-rewards/)¬†to participate in the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. By staking Ether, users help secure the network and, in return,¬†[earn staking rewards](https://www.netcoins.com/staking/). This passive income opportunity has encouraged many investors to lock up their ETH, reducing the circulating supply and further increasing demand.



* **Collateral and Lending**: In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), Ether is often used as collateral for loans and financial instruments. For instance, platforms like¬†[MakerDAO](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/mkr/)¬†allow users to lock up their ETH to mint¬†[stablecoins](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-are-stablecoins/)¬†like DAI. Additionally, lending protocols such as¬†[Aave](https://blog.netcoins.com/how-aave-is-leading-the-way/)¬†offer users the ability to earn interest on their ETH holdings.



* **Medium of Exchange and Digital Currency**: Beyond its role within the Ethereum ecosystem, Ether also functions as a digital currency. It‚Äôs used for payments and transactions between individuals and businesses, similar to Bitcoin. ETH‚Äôs liquidity and market capitalization have made it one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies across exchanges and payment platforms.

**Market Position of ETH**

Ether‚Äôs market position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, next to Bitcoin, is no accident.

**Ethereum 2.0 and the Transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**

**The Move from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake**

Ethereum initially operated on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which required miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. While effective, PoW came with several downsides, including high energy consumption, scalability issues, and the centralization of mining power.

[The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0](https://blog.netcoins.com/ethereums-dencun-update-a-deeper-dive-into-decentralized-finance-and-ethereum-2-0/)¬†marks a significant upgrade to the network‚Äôs consensus mechanism. Under PoS, validators replace miners, and instead of solving puzzles, they secure the network by staking their Ether. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the amount of ETH they have staked, making the process more energy-efficient and decentralized.

# Key Improvements in Ethereum 2.0

https://preview.redd.it/kaok8j22p03e1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=f48526e14102719264899e1af317656c13fbbe80

The move to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to bring a host of improvements to the network, addressing the limitations of the original Ethereum blockchain:

* **Energy Efficiency**: One of the most significant benefits of PoS is its drastically reduced energy consumption compared to PoW. PoW requires massive amounts of computational power, leading to high electricity usage and environmental concerns. By transitioning to PoS, Ethereum aims to become a more sustainable blockchain.

* **Scalability**: Ethereum 2.0 introduces sharding, a technique that splits the network into smaller chains called shards. Each shard can process transactions and smart contracts independently, increasing the overall throughput of the Ethereum blockchain. Sharding aims to allow Ethereum to handle thousands of transactions per second, alleviating congestion and reducing gas fees.

* **Security Enhancements**: PoS brings additional security benefits by increasing the cost of attacking the network. In PoS, validators must put their ETH at stake, and if they behave maliciously, they risk losing their staked funds. This economic incentive discourages malicious activity and enhances the overall security of the blockchain.

**The Roadmap and Challenges**

With the successful implementation of ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù and the rollout of sharding, Combined with the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions like rollups, Ethereum‚Äôs scalability has significantly increased.

SEC Risk-Free Coins to Watch ,cryptoddler,1glgirm,2024-11-06 21:48:32,2,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1glgirm/sec_riskfree_coins_to_watch/,Actual_Ad_5440,,"As Donald. J. Trump is now officially elected as the 47th president of United States, there are crypto tokens we should put on our lists. 



President Trump has publicly mentioned that if he gets re-elected, his first job in the office, is to fire Gary Gensler, Chairman of U.S SEC, from the position. 



Gary Gansler has been hated by Crypto investors, as he has been trying to put a harsh regulation on the Crypto industry and is well-known for his conflict with the Ripple, XRP token. 



Due to this issue, XRP token has been suppressed with the price action and the token has been mocked for a long time. 



Including XRP, there are more tokens that have been flagged as securities, by the U.S SEC, and let me list them, because those tokens will skyrocket when the new president reclaims the White House. 



**Crypto Tokens flagged as securities, by the SEC** 



**-Ripple ($XRP)** 



**-Cardano ($ADA)** 



**-Solana ($SOL)** 



**-Polygon ($POL)** 



**-Cosmos ($ATOM)** 



**-Internet Computer ($ICP)** 



**-Filecoin ($FIL)** 



**-Near ($NEAR)** 



**-Algorand ($ALGO)** 



**-Sandbox ($SAND)** 



**-Decentraland ($MANA)** 



**-Axie Infinity ($AXS)** 



**-Flow ($FLOW)** 



**-Uniswap ($UNI)** 



**-Chiliz ($CHZ)** 



**This is not financial advice, and I am not encouraging you to buy these tokens.** 

However, as they are being risk-free from the SEC now, the tokens can be in your watchlist for upcoming bullrun.

Best Play-To-Earn cryptocurrency games compared,CapitalistExploits,1f4tp0k,2024-08-30 08:12:22,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1f4tp0k/best_playtoearn_cryptocurrency_games_compared/,kayakero,,"Online gaming has seen a dizzying growth over the past decade, reaching a valuation of close to¬†$207 billion¬†by 2023, according to MarketWatch. At the same time, blockchain technology has also seen a boom and is now making it possible to host games. According to CoinMarketCap, there are currently¬†over 300¬†active blockchain games.

Blockchain gaming¬†has¬†captured the attention of both fans and detractors. Supporters believe it is a¬†revolutionary technology¬†that will make gaming even more accessible. On the other hand, skeptics see it as a house of cards that will eventually collapse.

Before you choose a side, we'll explain¬†what Play-to-Earn (P2E) games are¬†and give you some examples to try out for yourself.

# What is a Play-to-Earn game?

As the name suggests,¬†Play-to-Earn¬†games allow users to earn rewards by playing games. This is nothing new, as gaming tournaments like EVO have become more common in recent times. The difference, however, is that the Play-to-Earn games we are talking about are based on a blockchain and therefore their ecosystem is decentralized.

The rewards given for playing these games can be¬†cryptocurrencies or NFTs¬†in various forms (cards, functionalities, etc.). These rewards can then be used in the game ecosystem, for example to upgrade a character, or sold for cryptocurrencies and cashed out. For example, in an interview with Euronews, gamer Dominic Lumabi from the Philippines revealed that¬†he earned between ‚Ç¨136 and ‚Ç¨170 per month by playing Axie Infinity¬†for two hours each day.

This is a new economic model where players not only enjoy playing the game, but are also rewarded for it. This model is different from previous games, such as The Sims or World of Warcraft, where players can buy in-game assets, but which have no real-world value. Thus, the¬†Play-to-Earn system¬†places value on a player's time and skills to encourage them to continue playing and promote the community.

By the way, if you want to invest in non-fungible tokens, read our¬†guide to buying NFTs¬†.

# What is the difference between a Play-to-Earn game and the metaverse?

The term¬†metaverse¬†primarily refers to an alternate universe that can be unique if it exists on the blockchain. It is simply a virtual world where visitors can perform a variety of activities such as buying real estate, purchasing products, attending shows and concerts, and also playing games. Imagine that you live in another life where you can do the same things as in real life.

Thus,¬†P2E gaming may evolve into a metaverse. As you can imagine, this has become very popular as people look for alternative revenue streams. Blockchain-based gaming companies have also seen a boom, with over $4 billion invested in this industry as reported by [EveryRealM.com](http://EveryRealM.com) in 2022.

The concept of¬†Play-2-Earn¬†was not born with cryptocurrencies. Before blockchain, there were games that rewarded players. But¬†the added value of blockchain is decentralization and ownership of¬†game assets. The game publisher does not exclusively own the game assets, but they are distributed among the players.

# Best Play-To-Earn Cryptocurrency Games

As we mentioned earlier, there are over 300 Play-to-Earn games out there. In this article, we will simply highlight¬†the top 5 Play-to-Earn games¬†that we recommend you try.

# Axie Infinity

https://preview.redd.it/cf13yg9phsld1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fe003429f94242ff84374c1b80069002b644af5

Axie Infinity is¬†one of the most popular Play-to-Earn games, boasting¬†over eight million¬†registered players. Of these, approximately one million play every day, especially in Southeast Asia and the Philippines, where 35% of the network traffic comes from. This shows how lucrative this game has become.

This game involves¬†*Axies*, NFTs that players collect, breed, and farm. A player can then battle other players using their¬†Axies¬†or trade them with each other. The player who wins a battle is rewarded with¬†*Smooth Love Potion*¬†tokens that can be exchanged for the¬†AXS token, the native token of the Axie Infinity network. At the time of writing, each AXS token was worth ‚Ç¨5.74, according to CoinMarketCap.

To start, you'll need to purchase at least three Axies, each unique and with a specific set of skills and characteristics. You can then breed your Axies to create unique ones, or take on other players. Axies can then be traded for other Axies or sold if you wish to cash out your investment.

# Decentraland

https://preview.redd.it/r3gx9he3isld1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=a148900439377e27f2ff72483d6ef3060b5b4fc2

Unlike Axie Infinity, Decentraland is a 3D virtual world where players primarily engage in real estate. In Decentraland, you can purchase a plot of land and develop it as you wish. Some players have created or hosted games on their virtual land or even opened a store to sell digital assets.

Although the game had a shaky start after its 2017 ICO, which raised 86,206 ETH (roughly $26 million at the time), it has since become a phenomenon. Companies such as Samsung, PwC, Adidas, and JP Morgan all own land in Decentraland. Sotherby's hosted its first virtual auction on the Decentraland platform. Land prices skyrocketed, with the cheapest plot selling for $11,000 in January 2022.

If you want to become a land owner as well, you‚Äôll need to purchase the network‚Äôs native token, M¬†ANA, which is worth $2.71 at the time of writing. With very little MANA in circulation (the Decentraland Foundation owns 20% of the supply), the token‚Äôs value is quite volatile.

# The Sandbox

https://preview.redd.it/9bp8zpknisld1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=7708ea920c06d68fd546f1ddc32ce89643542fd1

The Sandbox¬†was an already popular mobile and PC game, but it can now be monetized since it was launched as a Play-to-Earn blockchain game. Players create¬†avatars called ASSETS¬†that are issued as NFTs. ASSETS can also be other objects such as trees, vehicles, buildings, etc. They can then be traded and sold on the platform‚Äôs marketplace using the native SAND token. The latter can be stored in any¬†Ethereum¬†wallet.

In The Sandbox, you can create your own game for free without any coding knowledge. But to publish the game and make it accessible to others, you will need to purchase LAND. It is also an NFT and is issued through public auctions. In total, 166,464 LAND will be available on the¬†OpenSea¬†secondary marketplace.

# Zed Run

https://preview.redd.it/biamm433jsld1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb308fa073d0f325904b8be8afe46c880c33ad4

It works similarly to Axie Infinity, the main difference being that¬†players own horses¬†instead of Axies. Horses are NFTs, so they can be issued, sold, and traded on the platform's marketplace. It's also possible to breed and improve existing horses, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.

The aim of the game is to compete against other players' horses to earn rewards. Naturally, the better your horse is, the easier it will be to win races and earn rewards.

# Alien Worlds

https://preview.redd.it/3rf83atbjsld1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=073c5689c009f7f2f75300d257b083c5cc826148

This is perhaps¬†the second most popular blockchain game¬†today, with a claimed 7 million all-time players and over 700,000 monthly active users, according to Business Wire. It involves alien species in the form of NFTs that can be captured and traded.

In the game,¬†players go on quests to other planets¬†and find different items that they can then trade. The game‚Äôs native token,¬†Trillium (TLM), can also be staked for additional rewards or used to vote in the game‚Äôs DAO.

The Metaverse and Cryptocurrencies: Building Virtual Economies,u_fxdatalabs_Yp,1f37dy2,2024-08-28 07:07:16,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_fxdatalabs_Yp/comments/1f37dy2/the_metaverse_and_cryptocurrencies_building/,fxdatalabs_Yp,,"# Introduction

Imagine stepping into a world where the physical and digital blend seamlessly, where your daily life activities, from socializing to shopping, are done entirely in a virtual space. Welcome to the Metaverse, a rapidly evolving concept that's capturing the imagination of tech enthusiasts, investors, and gamers alike. But what fuels this expansive digital universe? The answer lies in cryptocurrencies. In this article, we‚Äôll explore how the Metaverse and cryptocurrencies are intertwined, creating vibrant virtual economies that might one day rival our physical world.

# What is the Metaverse?

So, what exactly is the Metaverse? The term, originally coined in Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel¬†*Snow Crash*, refers to a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space. In simpler terms, the Metaverse is a digital universe where users can interact with each other and digital objects in real-time. Think of it as an expansive online world, but with much more depth and complexity. Today, examples like¬†*Fortnite*,¬†*Roblox*, and¬†*Decentraland*¬†offer glimpses of what the Metaverse can be.

# The Rise of Virtual Economies



As the Metaverse has grown, so too have its virtual economies. These economies function much like those in the real world, with supply and demand, goods and services, and even employment opportunities. Users can earn, spend, and invest digital currencies, creating an entire financial ecosystem within these virtual spaces. Whether it‚Äôs buying a virtual outfit for your avatar, purchasing land in a digital world, or trading rare in-game items, the Metaverse is giving rise to new forms of economic activity that are set to redefine our understanding of commerce.

# Cryptocurrencies: The Backbone of Virtual Economies

At the heart of these virtual economies lie cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional money, which is controlled by central banks and governments, cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies that operate on blockchain technology. This decentralized nature is crucial for the Metaverse, as it allows for secure, transparent, and instantaneous transactions without the need for intermediaries. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and newer tokens like MANA (used in Decentraland) are the lifeblood of the Metaverse, enabling users to buy, sell, and trade goods and services within these digital worlds.

# Blockchain Technology and the Metaverse

But it‚Äôs not just cryptocurrencies that make the Metaverse tick‚Äîblockchain technology itself plays a vital role. Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures the data cannot be altered retroactively. In the context of the Metaverse, blockchain enables decentralized ownership of digital assets, ensuring that users truly own the items they purchase. Whether it‚Äôs virtual land, art, or in-game items, blockchain ensures that these assets can‚Äôt be duplicated or tampered with, adding a layer of security and trust to virtual economies.

# NFTs and Digital Assets in the Metaverse



Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a buzzword in recent years, and for good reason. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content, and they have found a natural home in the Metaverse. In these virtual worlds, NFTs can represent anything from digital art and music to real estate and virtual goods. Because NFTs are built on blockchain technology, they provide proof of ownership and authenticity, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets with confidence.

# Virtual Real Estate: Owning Land in the Metaverse

Speaking of real estate, did you know you can buy land in the Metaverse? Virtual real estate is becoming a hot commodity, with plots of digital land selling for thousands‚Äîeven millions‚Äîof dollars. Platforms like¬†*Decentraland*¬†and¬†*The Sandbox*¬†allow users to purchase, develop, and sell virtual land, creating a new frontier for real estate investment. Just like in the real world, location matters‚Äîprime spots near popular areas or with unique features can command high prices. And with blockchain ensuring ownership, your virtual property is just as secure as your physical home.

# Gaming and the Metaverse

Gaming is a major driver of the Metaverse‚Äôs growth, and cryptocurrencies are playing a key role in this evolution. In many virtual worlds, players can earn cryptocurrency by completing tasks, participating in events, or trading items. These in-game currencies can often be exchanged for real money, blurring the lines between virtual and real-world economies. Games like¬†*Axie Infinity*¬†have popularized the concept of ‚Äúplay-to-earn,‚Äù where players can make a living by participating in the game‚Äôs ecosystem. It‚Äôs a revolutionary concept that‚Äôs changing the way we think about work and entertainment.

# Social Interaction and Digital Communities



The Metaverse isn‚Äôt just about transactions‚Äîit‚Äôs also a place for social interaction and community building. Cryptocurrencies facilitate these interactions by providing a medium of exchange that is both accessible and secure. Whether it‚Äôs tipping a virtual performer, donating to a community project, or buying virtual goods from a friend, cryptocurrencies make it easy to engage with others in the Metaverse. These interactions help foster a sense of belonging and community in virtual spaces, making the Metaverse not just a marketplace, but a social hub as well.

# The Economics of the Metaverse

The economies of the Metaverse operate on principles similar to those in the physical world, but with some key differences. In the Metaverse, supply and demand still drive prices, but the concept of scarcity is digital. For instance, virtual land or unique digital items are limited by design, creating a market for rare and valuable assets. Cryptocurrencies serve as the medium of exchange, and decentralized platforms ensure that these economies are not controlled by any single entity. This creates a truly free market where users have control over their assets and transactions.

# Investing in the Metaverse

As the Metaverse continues to grow, so too does the opportunity for investment. From virtual real estate to NFTs, there are numerous ways to invest in the Metaverse‚Äôs burgeoning economy. Companies are also getting in on the action, with tech giants like Facebook (now Meta) and Microsoft investing heavily in the development of virtual worlds. For individual investors, the Metaverse offers a chance to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative market. However, as with any investment, there are risks, and it‚Äôs important to do thorough research before diving in.

# Challenges and Risks of Virtual Economies



While the Metaverse and its virtual economies offer exciting opportunities, they also come with challenges and risks. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can make regulation difficult, leading to potential legal and financial pitfalls. Additionally, the volatility of cryptocurrencies can pose a risk for investors and users alike. There‚Äôs also the challenge of ensuring that these virtual economies are accessible and inclusive, rather than becoming exclusive playgrounds for the tech-savvy and wealthy.

# Regulation of the Metaverse and Cryptocurrencies

Regulation is a hot topic when it comes to the Metaverse and cryptocurrencies. Governments around the world are grappling with how to regulate these emerging technologies while fostering innovation. The decentralized nature of the Metaverse and cryptocurrencies presents unique challenges for regulators, who must balance the need for security and consumer protection with the desire to promote growth and innovation. As the Metaverse continues to evolve, we can expect to see more regulatory frameworks being developed to address these challenges.

# The Future of the Metaverse and Cryptocurrencies



So, what does the future hold for the Metaverse and cryptocurrencies? It‚Äôs clear that these technologies are here to stay, and they‚Äôre likely to play an increasingly important role in our lives. As the Metaverse continues to develop, we can expect to see even more integration of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and blockchain technology. Virtual economies will become more sophisticated, offering new opportunities for commerce, investment, and social interaction. The Metaverse has the potential to reshape not just the digital world, but the global economy as a whole.

# Conclusion

The Metaverse and cryptocurrencies are more than just buzzwords‚Äîthey‚Äôre the building blocks of a new digital frontier. As we continue to explore and develop these technologies, we‚Äôre creating virtual economies that offer unprecedented opportunities for innovation, investment, and social interaction. Whether you‚Äôre a gamer, an investor, or just someone curious about the future of technology, the Metaverse is a space worth watching.

As we move further into this digital age, the lines between the virtual and real worlds will continue to blur, creating a future that‚Äôs both exciting and full of potential.

# Understanding Web3 Marketing Funnels

**Marketing funnels**¬†in the Web3 context represent a transformative approach to user engagement and conversion.

Unlike traditional marketing funnels, which follow a linear path from awareness to action, Web3 funnels are designed with decentralization, community engagement, and user ownership at their core.

# Definition and Structure

In traditional digital marketing, a funnel typically includes:

1. **Awareness:**¬†Capturing the interest of potential customers.
2. **Consideration:**¬†Engaging prospects with valuable content.
3. **Conversion:**¬†Encouraging actions such as purchases or sign-ups.
4. **Retention:**¬†Maintaining customer relationships post-conversion.

Web3 funnels build on this structure but incorporate decentralized elements:

* **Community Engagement:**¬†An essential stage where users become active participants rather than passive consumers.
* **Tokenization:**¬†Introducing economic incentives through tokens to enhance engagement and loyalty.
* **Decentralized Decision-Making:**¬†Allowing users to influence project direction via governance tokens.

# Key Differences Between Traditional and Web3 Funnels

Traditional and Web3 funnels differ significantly in several aspects:

* **Ownership:**¬†In Web3, users often own part of the platform through tokens, contrasting with the customer-centric model of traditional funnels.
* **Trust and Transparency:**¬†Blockchain technology ensures immutable records, fostering higher trust levels among users.
* **Community Dynamics:**¬†Communities drive engagement in Web3 projects, becoming a critical component of the funnel.

# Importance of User Journeys



Creating effective Web3 marketing funnels involves understanding user journeys well. A user journey outlines the stages a person goes through, from first contact to becoming an active community member. Important factors to consider include:

* **Onboarding Process**: Making the onboarding experience smooth is essential for newcomers to decentralized platforms.
* **Engagement Touchpoints**: Finding and improving touchpoints that keep users involved is crucial for growth.
* **Feedback Mechanisms**: Adding feedback loops so community members can share ideas and suggestions.

Projects can develop marketing strategies that boost conversions and build strong communities. This all-encompassing approach is essential for success in the decentralized Web3 world.

# The Role of Community in Web3 Marketing

# The Significance of Communities in Driving Engagement and Loyalty

Community building is paramount. Unlike traditional marketing funnels that focus primarily on individual user conversion, Web3 projects thrive on collective engagement and loyalty.

Communities are not just a collection of users; they are ecosystems where members interact, share knowledge, and contribute to the project‚Äôs evolution.

# How Community Dynamics Shape User Behavior in Web3 Projects

**Community involvement**¬†is key in influencing user behavior. In Web3, users often have a stake in the project's success, leading to:

* **Encouraging active participation**¬†through voting and proposal systems.
* **Building trust and transparency**¬†through peer-to-peer interactions.
* **Using feedback loops**¬†for ongoing improvements based on community input.**The Concept of Community as an Economic Moat**

A strong community acts as an economic moat, providing competitive advantages that traditional businesses may find hard to replicate. Key aspects include:

* **Lower Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)**: Engaged communities reduce the need for expensive marketing campaigns by driving organic growth.
* **Enhanced User Retention**: Loyalty programs and token rewards keep users invested long-term.
* **Innovation Driven by Users**: Crowdsourced ideas lead to innovative solutions tailored to community needs.

Communities not only drive engagement but also create a robust foundation for sustainable growth in the evolving digital landscape of Web3.

# Designing Effective Web3 Marketing Funnels

Designing Web3 marketing funnels requires a nuanced approach that leverages decentralized technologies and the unique user behaviors they foster. Here are steps to create an effective funnel:

# 1. Identify Your Audience

Understand the demographics, interests, and behaviors of your target audience within the Web3 ecosystem. This forms the foundation for tailoring your marketing strategies.

# 2. Map Out the Funnel Stages

* **Awareness**: Use educational content and thought leadership to introduce users to your project.
* **Interest**: Engage with potential users through community channels like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram.
* **Consideration**: Provide detailed resources, such as whitepapers or AMAs, to help users evaluate your offering.
* **Conversion**: Make it easy for users to participate in token sales, staking, or other engagement activities.
* **Loyalty**: Retain users by continuously adding value through updates, exclusive content, and rewards.

# 3. Create an Engaging Onboarding Process

The onboarding experience is crucial for user retention. Here's how you can make it compelling:

* Simplify registration processes with minimal steps.
* Offer interactive tutorials or walkthroughs to familiarize new users with your platform.
* Utilize gamification elements like badges or rewards for completing tasks during onboarding.

# 4. Implement User Retention Strategies

Keeping users engaged over time is key to a successful Web3 project. Consider these strategies:

* **Regular Updates**: Keep the community informed about new features, partnerships, and improvements.
* **Incentivization**: Use tokenomics to reward active participation and contributions from community members.
* **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish channels for users to provide feedback and feel heard; this fosters a sense of ownership.

# 5. Analyze and Optimize

Continuously analyze user behavior data to identify drop-off points within the funnel. Use A/B testing to experiment with different approaches and optimize for better results.

By following these steps and focusing on creating a seamless user experience from awareness through loyalty, businesses can design Web3 marketing funnels that not only attract but also retain engaged users in the decentralized landscape.

# Leveraging Tokenomics in Marketing Funnels

**Tokenomics**¬†plays a crucial role in the Web3 ecosystem, fundamentally changing how community-driven projects operate and thrive. Tokenomics refers to the economic systems and incentives built around digital tokens, which are integral to many crypto marketing strategies.

# Understanding Tokenomics and Its Relevance

In Web3 projects, tokenomics is essential for fostering user engagement and participation. Digital tokens represent ownership stakes, rewards, or voting power within a decentralized platform. This creates a sense of¬†*ownership incentives*¬†among users, driving active involvement and long-term commitment.

# Incentivizing Contributions Through Tokenization

Tokenization can significantly enhance user loyalty by providing tangible rewards for contributions:

1. **Participation Rewards**: Users earn tokens by participating in community activities, such as governance votes or content creation.
2. **Staking Mechanisms**: Users stake their tokens to support network security or liquidity pools, earning additional tokens as rewards.
3. **Exclusive Access**: Holding specific tokens can grant access to premium features, events, or content.

These mechanisms ensure that users are not just passive participants but active contributors who benefit from the platform's success.

# Examples of Successful Tokenomic Integrations

Several Web3 projects have successfully integrated tokenomics into their marketing strategies:

1. **Uniswap**: Users earn UNI tokens by providing liquidity to trading pools. This has created a robust community of liquidity providers who are financially incentivized to support the platform.
2. **Decentraland**: LAND owners in this virtual world receive MANA tokens for participating in governance decisions, encouraging a vested interest in the project's future.
3. **SushiSwap**: By staking SUSHI tokens, users earn governance rights and additional rewards from protocol fees, fostering continuous engagement and loyalty.

Understanding and effectively implementing tokenomics can transform marketing funnels into powerful tools that drive sustained user engagement and growth.

# Utilizing Press Releases and Newsletters in Web3 Marketing

# Crafting effective press releases that resonate with the Web3 audience:

Creating a compelling¬†*web3 press release*¬†requires an understanding of the decentralized audience's values and interests. Authenticity and transparency are key. Highlight the project's unique value proposition, technological advancements, and community benefits. Use clear, jargon-free language to make complex concepts accessible. Incorporate quotes from key team members to add credibility and a human touch.

# Best practices for developing engaging crypto marketing newsletters:

1. **Targeted Content:**¬†Tailor your newsletters to specific segments within your community. Personalized content resonates more effectively.
2. **High-Quality Information:**¬†Deliver valuable insights, updates on project developments, and exclusive offers.
3. **Clear CTAs:**¬†Encourage actions such as participating in governance votes or joining community discussions.
4. **Visual Appeal:**¬†Utilize visuals like infographics and charts to simplify technical data.
5. **Consistency:**¬†Maintain a regular schedule to keep your audience engaged without overwhelming them.

Engaging¬†*crypto marketing newsletters*¬†foster loyalty by providing consistent, valuable content that keeps the community informed and involved in the project's evolution.

# Measuring Success in Web3 Marketing Funnels

To understand how well your marketing efforts are working in the Web3 space, it's important to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that are specific to this environment. While traditional KPIs like conversion rates and customer acquisition costs (CAC) still matter, Web3 also brings in new metrics that reflect how users engage in a decentralized way.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Web3

# 1. Token Distribution:

Keeping an eye on how tokens are distributed and circulated can give you valuable information about how engaged your community is and how much they are investing.

# 2. Smart Contract Interactions:

By tracking how frequently users interact with smart contracts, you can get a better understanding of how useful and widely adopted your decentralized application is.

# 3. User Retention Rates:

Looking at the number of users who continue to be active over time will show you how appealing your platform is to them.

# Community Health Metrics

Community health is crucial for the success of Web3 projects. In addition to regular engagement metrics, it's important to measure:

# 1. Active Participation:

The number of different people taking part in discussions, forums, and governance proposals can indicate how lively the community is.

# 2. Governance Activity:

When community members actively participate in voting processes, it shows that they are involved in making decisions and aligned with the project's goals.

# 3. Feedback Loops:

Getting regular feedback from community members through surveys or AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions) helps you understand their pain points and areas where improvements can be made.

By focusing on these KPIs and community health metrics, you can gain a deeper understanding of how successful your project is. This will allow you to continuously optimize both its technical performance and user satisfaction.

Web3 requires us to be flexible and open-minded when designing our marketing funnels. Instead of relying on traditional, linear models, we must shift our focus towards strategies that prioritize community involvement and interaction.

Building strong and engaged communities is crucial for the success of Web3 projects. These interactions go beyond simple transactions; they create lasting relationships that drive sustainable growth.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Adaptability:**¬†Marketing funnels must evolve in response to the decentralized and ever-changing Web3 environment.
* **Community-Driven Growth:**¬†Prioritizing community engagement over mere conversions paves the way for lasting success.
* **Tokenomics:**¬†Leveraging token-based incentives can significantly enhance user loyalty and participation.

*Now is the time for businesses to rethink their marketing strategies with a focus on community-driven growth.*¬†Engaging deeply with users and understanding their journey within the funnel will not only boost engagement but also ensure¬†*sustainable growth in Web3*."

It's a new project that I have to be honest, I haven't heard anything about.  I thought I'd drop some of my research on the project incase anyone was interested. Full disclosure, I do not have any affiliation with the project, but I did shuffle a few spaces.

The team seems to have an aggressive roadmap (could be good or bad) but seem to be in position to build the framework for an interesting metaverse. They've got a few Youtube videos and a functional website where they list their documents, shuffles, list collaborations, and a working market place. This could obviously go the way of the Dodo, but if it does pick up some steam, it could be an interesting project.

* Rxelms is a block-chain based Metaverse on the Algorand Blockchain
   * It will be cross-chain
   * It leverages NFT projects for the 99 ""Realms""
   * It can only ever have 99,999 ""Spaces""
   * It partners with chain NFT's
   * There will be ""Universal Basic Income"" meaning ""Space"" owners will get the native token
   * It uses the Unity Gaming Engine
      * Main competitors (Decentraland and The Sandbox use Unity as well)
* Tokenomics

Let's see their conditions now.

In November 2021, SAND touched $7.5, now trading at $0.4547, in May 2024. Current marketcap is $1.03 billion. (Peak marketcap in 2021 was $6.8B)

According to Dappradar data, Decentraland had 902 active users in the last 30 days, while Sandbox had just above 2K active users.

In the last 30 days, Decentraland dapp had only $14.4k transaction volume, but Sandbox had nearly $1 million tx volume.

Decentraland had 11,525 active users in February 2024, 12,763 in March 2024 and 9,879 active users in April 2024, according to the data from DCL-METRICS.

I haven't added GALA games into this comparison. It's more of a gaming-related project (shady as f\*) than a metaverse crypto project.

What's your opinion? Will MANA and SAND make a comeback in this year or next?

5. **Place an Order**: Decide on the type of order you want to place, such as market order or limit order, and specify the amount of MANA you wish to purchase. Review the order details and confirm the transaction.

6. **Securely Store Your MANA**: After purchasing MANA, consider transferring it to a secure cryptocurrency wallet for long-term storage. Hardware wallets or reputable software wallets offer enhanced security compared to keeping your tokens on the exchange.

"BTC and ETH come close to ATH, but what about the last bull run's favorite metaverse and gaming tokens: SAND, MANA, GALA, and AXS? Are they dead? Any chances of a revival?",ethtrader,1baqo7u,2024-03-09 15:01:22,38,0.85,75,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1baqo7u,Consistent-Revenue61,Sentiment,"Last time, in 2021, when BTC made an all-time high of ~$69K, four major gaming tokens were the center of attention and were receiving a flood of investments.¬†Those are AXS, SAND, MANA, and GALA.

The Metaverse and GamiFi narratives were at their peak, and to everyone's surprise, these tokens have grown bigger than many Fortune 500 companies raking in billions of dollars in market capital. 

What happened to them? Do you follow any of these projects?

Technically speaking, in my opinion, SAND and MANA can make a comeback‚Äîat least 50% of the last peak. That means these metaverse-focused tokens will have their day when BTC, ETH, and this memecoin frenzy end. If you check these charts carefully, you can see the volume has started to appear in the chart and the green candles as well.

Don't think that these tokens will reach another ATH. When the price of these coins reaches at least half of their all-time high, I will sell them.

Axie Infinity's token, AXS, peaked at $165 in November 2021. Right now, it's trading at ~$10.

Sandbox's token, SAND, peaked at $8.45 in November 2021. Right now, it's trading at ~$0.75.

Decentraland's token, MANA, peaked at $5.9 in November 2021. Right now, it's trading at ~$0.75.

Gala Games' token, GALA, peaked at $0.84 in November 2021. Right now, it's trading at ~$0.056.

What do you think about the chances of these game projects coming back? In your opinion, which new projects will spearhead the narrative of GamiFi and Metaverse this time around?"

Can you use ETH to buy on Decentraland without converting it to MANA?,decentraland,1b1zmox,2024-02-28 01:50:20,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland/comments/1b1zmox/can_you_use_eth_to_buy_on_decentraland_without/,trachtmanconsulting,,"Asking because I am not sure. Can I just use ETH to directly buy NFT on the platform? And if not, why not? (as it's a decentralized platform on the ETH BC)?

(I am not a player, this is for research purposes).

Thanks!"

above are my crypto assets (i have almost 1eth in an account i can‚Äôt find my login for‚Ä¶ rip) that i‚Äôve had for years. i was big into it in summer of 21, and (if you have been in crypto for any time, know the bull run was supposed to last until feb 22). it did not and all my shit TANKED, quickly too. since then, i haven‚Äôt touched any of this. it has grown quite a lot this last year and i‚Äôm happy with my earnings/gain back. i‚Äôm *wanting* to get into day trading penny stocks, or possibly just growing my portfolio with short term stocks. 
however, as ive started trading, they have not panned out how i expected, leaving me with some decent losses (30% on one currently, still holding on as i do believe in it, just somehow it went down ((LUNR)). with all of that being said, *ideally*, i put this into one of my investment accounts/brokers, and use it for capital to trade. my debacle comes in where i know if i put it in savings, i will get 4.35% apy with 0 risk. if i put it in my brokerage and trade, it‚Äôs basically up to me how risky i get. i also have an investment advisor / full service broker who manages one of my portfolios, so i‚Äôm also tempted to put it all there and let him do what he thinks is best. 

TLDR; i‚Äôve got $1,400 in crypto and not sure if i should keep it there, put in HYSA, my personal brokerage, or to my investment advisor / full service broker for him to invest on my behalf. 

thank you for all your suggestions/advice!"

MANA (Decentraland) not showing - did i miss something?,ledgerwallet,1appd5r,2024-02-13 04:16:28,2,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/1appd5r/mana_decentraland_not_showing_did_i_miss_something/,Efficient_Garlic4434,Official Support Response,"Hello everyone, 

I sent many tokens to my ledger about 1 year ago. 

Now i'm ""undusting"" it, and for some reason, i just cant seem to get my Mana tokens to show... I sent them from Binance, so was thinking they would appear in SmartChain account, but they dont. They actually dont appear anywhere which is..well..impossible :-) 

Is there a trick with MANA? 

Thank you"
