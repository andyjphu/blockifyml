I’ve had some luck with meme coins and decided to slowly start testing the waters with more stable coins. Essentially the plan is to put $10k more into my account this week. I’m not looking to withdraw anything anytime soon and am fine with being patient.

With that, if I distributed $10k more into these coins I currently have, what would you rate my current line up 1-10? Also, if you had to reco one to kill and another new coin, what would it be?

Note I put $10k into bitcoin, eth and litecoin through fidelity this week as well. Hoping I didn’t get in too late and beat any rush to crypto Trump might unlock in the coming years.

Goal: Hoping to beat the SP500 YoY gains. 

Thoughts?"

Does running a node with Stader/RocketPool etc. make sense?,ethstaker,1d01x3y,2024-05-24 22:31:12,7,0.89,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/1d01x3y/does_running_a_node_with_staderrocketpool_etc/,mojeeldorado1544,,"Hello,

So a couple of months ago I was interested in running a node. Two main tokens/services came to my mind, RPL and Stader. Since you need some ETH worth of their respective token, there was always a risk that you actually lose more with devaluation of those tokens, than you can make up with your ETH return.

I see that both the SD and RPL Tokens fell, resulting in some hundreds $ lost. Does anyone have a calculation or can give a comparision if its really worth the risk (considering there is also a additional smart contract risk)

Main reason is of course that I dont have 32ETH so liquid staking is the only other option.

TY"

I do have some minimal Blender experience but nothing really productive or fruitful, I'm more of a programmer as I'm sure my choice of first project suggests.  
Here's where I'm stuck atm:  
1. The barbes are a spiral curve which is then extended straight out to make the pointy bits. Is there way to deform the spirals such that they follow a path (i.e. wrap them around the center wires)? My current solution of just increasing the radius by an adjustable factor works fine, but improving on that would make it much more polished  
2. How could I shrink the tips of the barbes in a more precise way than with control points? I've seen ways to do that and had some success trying them, however I don't want to deform the entire straight bit, ideally just a set amount of it which can be changed   
Also, ideas on how to make it more like a rough cut / wedge shape than just a fine point would be much appreciated :)

Sorry about the massive node mess, I tried to keep things labeled but it got out of hand once I turned the variables into input parameters. It should still be organized, there's just random wires occasionally going in indiscernible directions

Top 3 Undervalued Gems on BNB Chain To Watch Out For in 2024,CryptoMoonShots,182pz84,2023-11-24 06:20:58,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/182pz84/top_3_undervalued_gems_on_bnb_chain_to_watch_out/,Siddy676,BSC Token,"The crypto market has started looking up. If you are still going long for only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a few blue chips, you are missing out on some great profit-making opportunities.   
  
With over 20,000 tokens, the crypto market is a cove of hidden gems with mind-blowing use cases and fundamentals. Here are the top 3 picks for undervalued gems on the BNB chain for you to explore before the whales do.   
  
DexCheck (DCK)  
DexCheck is an AI-enabled analytics platform providing intelligence tools and data-driven trading solutions for cryptocurrencies and NFTs.   
  
Over 500 visitors visit DexCheck daily, and continues to gain traction. Over 1200 new wallets add DCK to their portfolio every month. In November, DexCheck saw two significant milestones.   
  
Sniper bot, a Telegram bot for quick and profitable one-click purchases, was successfully launched in early November. The second is the DexCheck IPSO (Initial Private Sale Offering). IPSO will also act as an incubator for high-potential crypto projects.   
  
With a fully dedicated team and community-led growth, the token has the potential to climb up by 5x from its current price. Given the increasing demand for Telegram bots and AI-driven solutions, it is well-positioned. Price Prediction posits a 15x growth for the token in 2030.   
  
At a market cap of $3 million, DCK is highly undervalued. The technicals show the token is recovering and is ripe for a sharp rally.   
  
Stader (SD)  
Stader is a multi-chain liquid staking platform for Polygon, Hedera, BNB, Ethereum, and others. Stader raised $12.5m in funding from 3AC and other investors. It has a TVL of $51.8 million on Polygon, $10.5 million on BNB Chain, $34.38 million on Hedera, and $9.2 million on Fantom as of March 6.   
  
It has a user base of 70,000 stakers with over $138 million worth of staked crypto. Stader issues liquid tokens instead of staked tokens, which can be used to explore DeFi possibilities across chains.   
  
Stader is also slowly moving towards institutional adoption and holds great potential for an upside.   
  
Thena (THE)   
It’s a new DEX built on top of the BNB Chain. The DEX has a current TVL of $32 million and an average daily trading volume of $19 million. Thena is a black horse among the DEXes, given its list of innovative features.   
  
It offers smart routing, deep liquidity, and Automated Market Makers (AMM) for low slippage and high returns. There are no deposit or withdrawal fees. Users can stake their assets and earn instant passive income. No VCs are backing Thena. It is community-driven and governed by a vote escrow system via its ERC-721 standard token veTHE.  
  
There’s just one qualm – little information is available on the team and the founders. The token has begun its uptrend recently and is still 85% below its ATH. Being a low-cap token, Thena is undervalued and has growth potential.   
  
Which One Would You Invest In?   
Bitcoin halving is near. The market has sustained its gains, and investor momentum is building. Thena has partially recovered its bear market losses, while Stader looks forward to exploring more markets for liquid staking.   
  
DexCheck, particularly, ticks the AI narrative, smart trading tools, and analytics. It has gained a wider user base after its IPO and successful launches. Which one fulfills the criteria for your next investment? "

With over 500 daily visitors and 1200 new wallets adding DCK monthly, the momentum is real. November brought two major milestones – the Sniper bot for lightning-fast purchases and the DexCheck IPSO, a hub for promising crypto projects.   
  
Stader (SD): Stader is revolutionizing liquid staking across Polygon, Hedera, BNB, and more! With $12.5m funding, a TVL of $138 million, and 70,000 stakers, it's making waves. Hold your breath – liquid tokens instead of staked tokens, opening doors to DeFi exploration across chains.  👀💼  
  
Thena (THE): With a $32 million TVL, $19 million daily trading volume, and innovative features like smart routing and zero fees, it's catching attention. The catch? Limited info on the team, but don't let that overshadow its potential. The uptrend has started, and at 85% below its ATH, Thena might just be the underdog ready to soar.

These are our metrics milestones since the last update:

* 145 Node Operators, 139 of them being Permissionless Node Operators
* Surpassed the 20k staked ETH barrier, standing now at 20,267  ETH

On another note, we have 2 interesting protocol updates that some of you have been waiting for!

\- Firstly, there’s a Smart Contract Upgrade proposal to change the withdrawal address management. If this proposal were to pass, only the current withdrawal address will be able to set a new withdrawal address, removing therefore some security issues that could appear in our current system if the node address was compromised. [https://forum.staderlabs.com/t/ethx-smart-contract-upgrade-proposal/926/2](https://forum.staderlabs.com/t/ethx-smart-contract-upgrade-proposal/926/2) 

\- Second, a community member and DAO Delegate has shared his thoughts about how could our incoming SD borrowing and lending market look like.   
This new feature will allow people to run validators with 0 SD token exposure, as they would be borrowing it from willing SD holders. We know many of you might be interested in running staking pool validators with just ETH exposure, and therefore we’d love to see your thoughts and feedback on what you would like to see within this new module, whether it’s here in this post or in the forum.

Big news from Stader Labs and AVADO. As Stader Labs prepares for its imminent mainnet launch, they've teamed up with AVADO to provide a killer deal to the Ethereum staking community. 

Here's the rundown: For every validator activated on AVADO post-launch, Stader Labs will reward you with $100 in SD tokens. This applies to the first 400 validators and is on a first-come, first-served basis. That means you could potentially earn back your entire AVADO hardware investment in SD tokens!

A $900 AVADO i5 device? That's 9 validators. The $1600 i7 model? You'd need to activate 16 validators. 

AVADO is launching a new $900 device around the time of Stader's mainnet launch. To get notified when it's available, sign up here: https://forms.gle/rDyVzGBFzH1WVdeV7

With the launch of our  ""PowerUp Partnership"" with Avado, activating a Stader ETHx validator will now involve $100 in SD allocation for each validator activated. This means that with enough validators, you could potentially get an AVADO for free! 

Here's how it works: 

\- Purchase an i5 AVADO device for $900. Spin up 9 validators on Stader, and you've got yourself a free AVADO! 

\- If you're interested in the $1600 i7 model, run 16 validators and it's yours for nothing!

Please note this offer is on a first-come, first-served basis, so act fast!

AVADO’s yet-to-be-released $900 device is on its way! Be the first to know when it's available by signing up here: [https://forms.gle/rDyVzGBFzH1WVdeV7](https://forms.gle/rDyVzGBFzH1WVdeV7)

Can't wait? You can grab an AVADO device right now at [https://ava.do/shop](https://ava.do/shop)

Take advantage of this exclusive offer and join us in revolutionizing Ethereum staking!

Happy Staking!"

1/Interest-bearing tokens.

Did you know?

“Lock, Staked And Two Smoking Fantoms LP”  is set with two interest-bearing tokens:

yv-FTM, a boosted token in $FTM…

And $sFTMX, a liquid staking token.

Meaning?

You don’t only get swap fees and farming rewards.

You also get:

Yield boost on FTM thanks to yv-FTM…

And staking rewards on your sFTMX.

(Currently, adding 8.8% APR)

Yet, that’s not all.

2/ Dual rewards party. 

When you join this LP, you get dual token rewards:

Beethoven’s governance token, $BEETS…

And Stader's native token, $SD.

Quick Fact:

$SD token launched on CoinList a few months ago.

We got the highest registrations (1.1 M+) in CoinList history.

Now, you’ll get your hands on it through our rewards

And guess what…

3/ Anti-Impermanent loss LP.

The sFTMX - yv-FTM pool has little to no impermanent loss to worry about.

Why?

That's because the sFTMX represents your staked FTM plus staking rewards.

In practice this means…

sFTMX appreciates in a steady and predictable way.

Plus, yv-FTM follows the FTM price as well.

On top of that...

Currently, there’s a sweet 22% APR.

See for yourself here: 
https://beets.fi/#/pool/0xc0064b291bd3d4ba0e44ccfc81bf8e7f7a579cd200000000000000000000042c

LP swap fees..
Staking rewards on your sFTMX..
Dual token rewards: $BOO and $SD
Exposure to $FTM appreciation..
And NO impermanent loss

Plus, exclusive $SD rewards for the true Spooky fans.

Step #1: Get sFTMX on Stader.

Go to http://fantom.staderlabs.com and stake your FTM.

In return, you’ll get our brand new sFTMX token.

sFTMX gives you 13.5% APY, reserved for those who stake for 365
days…

Without actually locking in your FTM.

Step #2: Join FTM-sFTMX LP on @SpookySwap

Now that you have sFTMX…

It’s time to join the FTM-sFTMX LP on SpookySwap.

You can do it here:
https://spookyswap.finance/add/FTM/0xd7028092c830b5C8FcE061Af2E593413EbbC1fc1

Make sure to have the same amount of FTM to pair them up.

Then, hit “Supply”.👇

Congratulations!

You’ve joined the  FTM-sFTMX LP.

That means you're getting:

LP swap fees…
NO impermanent loss to worry about…
Staking rewards on your sFTMX...
And exposure to $FTM appreciation.

You can see your LP tokens at any time in the “My Potions” tab.👇

Step #3: Farm your LP tokens.

Now that you have your LP tokens…

It’s time to farm!

Click the “Farm” tab at the top and find the FTM-sFTMX one.

Currently, there’s a juicy 22% APR in dual token rewards.

That means you get $BOO, and our own token, $SD.

Now, all you have to do is click “Stake” and “Confirm”. 👇

Step #4: Stake your $BOO rewards.

You can boost even more your gains by staking your $BOO tokens.

In return, you get $xBOO.

A representation of your staked $BOO plus an extra 41.64% APR.

Just go to the “Stake Boo” tab on top.

Then, click “Approve Boo” and “Stake”.👇

Step #5: Stake your $xBOO tokens.

The last step is staking your $xBOO tokens

Why?

Currently, there’re extra $SD token rewards for the true spooky fans.

If you hurry, you can catch a sweet 53% APR.

Just hit “Approve” and then “Stake”👇"

I’ve watched a number of videos regarding LunaX on stader but in their steps they often gloss over what happens after depositing into the liquidity pool.

Can anyone point me to the most accurate APR for LunaX-Luna LPing? Massive discrepancy.,terraluna,tyvq53,2022-04-08 00:52:36,3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/terraluna/comments/tyvq53/can_anyone_point_me_to_the_most_accurate_apr_for/,Rhino8696,Discussion,"Hi there, 

On Stader's dapp they say the **APR** for providing LunaX-Luna liquidity is **28.92%** ([https://terra.staderlabs.com/lt-pools](https://terra.staderlabs.com/lt-pools))**.**   
I am then given two options: LP on Loop, or LP on Terraswap.  
If I go to Loop's dapp ([https://dex.loop.markets/farm2](https://dex.loop.markets/farm2)) you can see that they say their total **APR** for the LunaX-Luna LP is **19.75%.**  
Not sure how I would ever see the total APR (Tx fees + SD rewards) for LPing on Terraswap, but I don't assume its much different.

Why is there a discrepancy of almost 10% between what Stader claims is the APR of LPing and what Loop claims?"

I'm currently employing the Lido -> Astroport stLuna-Luna LP pool and getting around 16-20% (it has been fluctuating a lot). I like this strat because I am getting rewarded in ASTRO tokens and I am super bullish on ASTRO. 

However, I also like the LunaX-Luna strat offered from Stader and Loop at the moment... but I am not as bullish on SD as I am on ASTRO. The yield is a tad higher with this strategy, though. 

What are other people doing lately? There seems to be a new project/opportunity weekly these days in the Terra ecosystem and it is hard to keep up!"
