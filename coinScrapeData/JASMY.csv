Let’s dive into the evolving use cases and future potential of both Jasmy and XRP. We can look at how these projects are developing, their real-world applications, and how they could influence their respective sectors in the coming years.

1. Jasmy Coin: Evolution and Use Cases

Jasmy is primarily focused on empowering individuals with control over their data, especially in the context of IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It seeks to create a decentralized system where data generated by personal IoT devices (smartphones, wearables, connected cars, etc.) is controlled by the users rather than large corporations.

Current and Future Use Cases:
	•	Decentralized Data Storage: Jasmy aims to give people ownership of the data generated by their IoT devices. This is especially relevant in today’s digital landscape, where personal data is often controlled by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Jasmy’s blockchain provides a secure and private way to store and manage that data.
	•	IoT Ecosystem: As IoT devices become more ubiquitous (smart homes, smart cities, connected healthcare, etc.), Jasmy could serve as the underlying platform for data storage and transfer between devices. For example, your wearable fitness tracker or smart home devices could send and store data securely on Jasmy’s blockchain.
	•	Data Sovereignty: With concerns over privacy and surveillance, data sovereignty (giving users control of their data) is a growing concern. Jasmy is positioned to tap into this by allowing individuals to choose how their data is used, without it being exploited by centralized platforms.
	•	Tokenized Data Economy: Jasmy could help create a tokenized data economy, where users can earn tokens for sharing their data in ways that benefit them, rather than large corporations profiting off it.
	•	Enterprise Applications: Jasmy could eventually be used by companies to securely store and manage vast amounts of IoT data for applications in sectors like logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and smart cities.

Technological Development:
	•	Partnerships: Jasmy has already partnered with SoftBank, one of Japan’s leading tech firms, which could help accelerate adoption of its IoT solutions. SoftBank’s involvement in the telecom and tech space could enable broader access to Jasmy’s technology, particularly in the deployment of 5G networks and connected devices.
	•	Future Integration: As IoT adoption grows and blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Jasmy could see further integration into global IoT networks. This could position Jasmy as a leading platform for secure, decentralized data management in the rapidly expanding IoT sector.

2. XRP (Ripple): Evolution and Use Cases

XRP, created by Ripple Labs, is one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the financial space. It is designed to solve issues related to cross-border payments and financial transactions—specifically the inefficiencies and high costs of traditional international remittances.

Current and Future Use Cases:
	•	Cross-Border Payments: XRP’s primary use case is to facilitate cross-border payments. Traditional international money transfers (via banks or remittance services) are slow, costly, and inefficient. Ripple uses XRP to allow for near-instant and low-cost transactions between banks and financial institutions across borders. RippleNet is already being used by major financial institutions and banks globally, such as Santander, PNC, and Standard Chartered.
	•	Liquidity and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Ripple’s ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) service uses XRP as a bridge currency to facilitate instant payments between different fiat currencies. For example, an individual or business can send USD to a recipient in Mexico, where XRP is used to convert the USD into Mexican Pesos instantly and at a low cost. This can save banks and financial institutions millions in liquidity costs.
	•	Smart Contracts and Enterprise Solutions: Ripple has also been exploring smart contracts to enhance its payment solutions, potentially enabling programmable money and more efficient, automated financial transactions.
	•	Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Ripple is working on CBDC projects, collaborating with governments to integrate XRP into central bank digital currencies. This could be a significant long-term use case for XRP, as governments around the world explore creating their own digital currencies.

Technological Development:
	•	RippleNet and Ripple’s Network: RippleNet, Ripple’s global network, connects financial institutions and enables fast, low-cost international transfers. Over 300+ financial institutions are already part of the network, and this number is expected to grow as adoption of blockchain-based payment systems increases.
	•	Regulatory Challenges: Ripple has faced regulatory challenges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has raised concerns about whether XRP is a security. However, Ripple has continued to fight the SEC’s lawsuit, and a favorable resolution for Ripple could unlock even greater growth and adoption.
	•	Expansion into New Markets: As the global financial landscape continues to shift towards digital solutions, Ripple’s XRP is well-positioned to play a key role in the future of digital payments, especially as traditional banking infrastructure adopts more efficient blockchain solutions.

Potential Synergies Between Jasmy and XRP:

Though Jasmy and XRP serve different primary functions (data management for Jasmy and payments for XRP), there are potential synergies between the two technologies:
	•	Decentralized Payments in IoT: Jasmy’s IoT devices could use XRP for instant micropayments or for transferring value when interacting with different connected devices. For instance, Jasmy could enable a system where IoT devices like smart cars or smart homes could use XRP for transactional exchanges (e.g., paying for energy, services, or data usage in real-time).
	•	Cross-Border Data and Payment Solutions: If Jasmy gains traction in international markets, XRP could facilitate cross-border payments related to the IoT data economy. For example, data shared via Jasmy’s platform could have associated value, and XRP could be used to handle transactions across borders with minimal fees.
	•	Blockchain Integration: Both projects use blockchain technology to create decentralized ecosystems, and as both ecosystems mature, there could be future integrations or collaborations to support global decentralized data and payment solutions.

Conclusion:

Both Jasmy and XRP have distinct but potentially complementary roles in the future of blockchain adoption. Jasmy focuses on decentralizing data ownership and empowering individuals in the IoT space, while XRP is revolutionizing cross-border payments and financial transactions.

As blockchain adoption expands in both the IoT and financial sectors, there’s potential for these two projects to complement each other, particularly as the global digital economy grows and requires efficient solutions for data management and value transfer.

Would you like to explore more specific developments within each project or look into potential future collaborations between such blockchain technologies?"

Jasmy will store and protect the data for all kind of IoT devices. there is no limit to data storage. they will implement new protocols that will become international standard in the field. Sony does not fail. period. Jasmy will pump. it may take 1 month, 3-month, 1 year, 4 years. I don't care. I own 500 000 Jasmy. and I will be a millionaire when this thing turns into what I think it will turn into. any young person should by this project for the future. as a long-term investment. leave the money there and wake up in 2, 5, 10 years rich. it will turn into a bitcoin on its own...keep talking about it everywhere."

In this context, a Finbold analyst has highlighted four promising cryptocurrencies with prices below $0.10 for those who want to start 2025 with good investment opportunities.

Although these cryptocurrencies present positive indicators, short-term fluctuations are common. Investors should conduct detailed research and align their strategies with their financial goals. Opportunities exist, but diversification and planning are key to success.

# Shiba Inu (SHIB)

Initially only seen as a memecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has evolved into a highly-interested asset. The introduction of Shibarium, its layer-2 blockchain, marked a milestone by improving scalability and transaction efficiency. Since its launch, the platform has recorded over 700 million transactions.

Currently, the SHIB meme cryptocurrency is trading at $0.000022, with 55% of its holders in profit. Moreover, movements by large investors (whales) reinforce its short-term appeal.

Plans to launch a stablecoin and the TREAT token as a reward expand the possibilities within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

The data points to an increase in trading volume to $162 million, as well as a favorable long/short ratio on Binance of 2.2595 for top traders. These factors reinforce the reliability of JASMY as an investment option.

# Gala (GALA)

Focused on the gaming sector, Gala Games (GALA) has been gaining traction, even with some recent pullbacks. It is currently trading at $0.03, and is exhibiting a strong bullish bias. Binance data shows a long/short ratio of 4.4915 for prominent traders, indicating confidence in the token.

# Bitcoin and Ethereum historical contracts expiration

This Friday, the crypto market faces a historic event with the expiration of **$18 billion** in Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts, marking the largest volume ever recorded. This phenomenon can generate significant volatility and opportunities for traders and investors.

Of the total amount, approximately $14.38 billion is held in Bitcoin options, while $3.7 billion is tied to Ethereum. In terms of contracts, about 88,537 Bitcoin options and 796,021 Ethereum options are expected to expire, far exceeding last week’s volumes.

This increase reflects traders' anticipation to maximize profits or mitigate risks before contracts expire.

I’m not doing a personal case study yo see how much (or little) it’s worth in 4 years, as well as diversifying a little bit.  

I’m not going all-in or looking for the next to the moon alt coin.  But I am looking for a few speculative coins that have a promising future.  A few names I’ve read about are HBAR, JASMY, DOGE (obviously 😂), Shib, XRP, ADA, POLY, GRAPH and a few others.  

I’m curious to get the communities input on 1-2 alt coins that may benefit from the Trump admin.  I know we cannot predict nor see the future - just looking for educated suggestions to invest $500-1k max in each alt coin - or maybe $250 in 4-5 alt coins.  

This entire crypto position is something I’ll live with if it goes to $0 but obviously don’t want that so any suggestions on a few alt coins is very much appreciated.

Ironically today, after we've fallen, the walls that used to be at .045 are gone. 

I know people on here can track dev wallets. I'm curious to try and find out who's selling millions of coins as this climbs. And or in some cases is putting in walls to keep it from climbing it seems.  Typically 3 or 6 million at a time. 

I'm going to keep looking into this but just thought it should be out there. Perhaps someone else will have legit thoughts or evidence of these sales as well."

Why I went all in for Jasmy and not any other coin. Need validation.,JasmyToken,1heb0r8,2024-12-14 14:57:04,88,0.96,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/JasmyToken/comments/1heb0r8/why_i_went_all_in_for_jasmy_and_not_any_other/,Charming_Party_2052,:Jasmy_Spin_Logo_Clear_64: JASMY :Jasmy_Coin_-_Clear_64x64:,"I am a what you call a risk averse person so naturally I was late to crypto. When I jumped in this year, I invested some in BTC, ETH, SOL, all the trusted ones but as I learned more and more, Jasmy caught my attention.
Reasons I went all with Jasmy:

1- I trust everything that came out of Japan post WW. I know its very generic and there are exceptions but everything they do is authentic, better than the world. Sony, Toyota, Cameras and whatnot (also why I always buy a toyota)

2- I feel like the token has some utility and some partnerships could help boost it and the drivers are taking it slow and steady. Plus I’ve always liked the idea of IoT 

3- I like to steer clear of coins that everyone is talking about and frankly no one was talking about Jasmy

4- the calculation make sense for it to explode in the near future. Its low MC-Price combination makes sense.
Unlike XRP followers who claim it will go to $100 (which doesn’t make sense as much as I try to understand it)

Since I went all in (50% of portfolio), what do you guys think? Is it a wise decision?

Thankyou! "

Ive been playing around with a few coins over a few years, and this is my first time coming across this one!

To summarize this post: I’d love to know more about the coin, and I’d love to know why you chose to invest in it! I also want to know what makes you feel safe about this coin and its future? I showed it to a friend of mine who is heavily invested in crypto and he thinks I should tread lightly around this project.

Much needed reality check,Hedera,1hd969t,2024-12-13 05:11:37,51,0.92,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1hd969t/much_needed_reality_check/,m_e_sek,Discussion,"Hi all,

**TL:DR**; *For newcomers*: Hedera is a solid project and a promising long-term investment, however do not give in to FOMO. Treat HBAR as if it was a long term security you intend to hold several years at least. Current price action is not supported by fundamentals.

Note: This is not going to be an overall comprehensive analysis of the network. Nor is it a comprehensive list of use cases. I use some of the high profile projects to shed some light on the network fundamentals. I have not tried to balance my critical points with corresponding promising/positive news (which are plenty) as these are yet to materialize. The purpose of the below text is to provde a reality check only

**Fundamentals:**

Hedera is up 430% in the last 30 days (as per coinmarketcap). So yay!!! But in terms of network and market fundamentals Hedera is not in a better place than it was a month ago. In the past few months some worrying developments took place (as well as positive news we all are accustomed to)  

* It's star usecase [atma.io](http://atma.io) decided they will not use HCS. Over the last year [atma.io](http://atma.io) had averaged more than 1500 TPS and provided the proof of concept that a real work corporation can run a massive use case. However, this use case was subsidized (therefore the financial viability of a massive use case was never proven or tested). In an update, Hedera told the community that based on client needs [atma.io](http://atma.io) will no longer use HCS. This implies (no proof, just some indirect evidence) that atma.io's clients are not **YET**  demanding the tracking and logging [atma.io](http://atma.io) could provide using Hedera. Since [atma.io](http://atma.io) going offline Hedera network revenue and activity is less than 10% of when [atma.io](http://atma.io) was online. 
* There is a silver lining in the [atma.io](http://atma.io) developments. First of all Avery Dennison is still on the GC and they have not declared that their involvement with Hedera is at an end. While current situation does not require supply chain and (especially) carbon tracking, things are likely to change in 2025/26 when EU institutions will require more robust ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and tracking. [Atma.io](http://Atma.io) now has the ability to provide this service with a proven track record that they can deliver with almost 100% uptime.
* Other prominent (potentially huge, also) use cases like DOVU and NEURON have progressed in 2024 but they are yet to produce tangible impact on the network. IOT based use cases are still a solution in search of a problem. Right now there is no urgent demand for tracking IOT data. Every enterprise can utilize IOT data provately and DLT solutions on IOT data will only become viable when either public demands more transperency and accountability or lawmakers enforce new standards on how IOT data is collected, used, stored, and accounted for. Hedera **COULD** be a leader in this space but there is competition (like IOTA an IOT based project altogether, or Jasmy - especially their idea of personal data lockers). 
* Some prominent use cases like BankSocial and TuneFM have had a rocky year. BankSocial has several hundred thousand dollars missing from it's wallets and lack of transparency and owning up to their mistakes is not giving me much confidence. BankSocial wants to revolutionise lending through credit unions. It's an incredibly promising concept but the leadership of the project has a less than perfect reputation. [Tune.FM](http://Tune.FM) is also an interesting use case of decentralising music streaming. They promise 10-100X higher revenue to musicians (depends on whether you are an independent artist or represented by a major label). Problem is they cannot onboard any major labels and any spotify killer needs to have at least two of the big three to have the remotest chance. Their whitepaper had earmarked 2021 as the first major label to be onboarded. Also, team has been dumping JAM on the open market this year. Of the max supply of 92B they have already released around 28B (about 20B and several years ahead of schedule). This on itself may not be a problem, but this massive coin release implies that running the operations (despite millions of dollars in investment secured in late 2024) is not going exactly to plan. It's still  not certain if [Tune.FM](http://Tune.FM) can produce any significant traffic on Hedera at all.
* One of the most important use cases is expected to be the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE). There were news around TXSE filing on December 1 but as far as I know TXSE is yet to apply for registration. If TXSE materializes and if it uses Hedera, then this is going to be a massive use case (and a huge speculative boost as well). So far, there are not actual developments but only expectation.
* RWA (real worl asset) tokenization is likely to be a huge use case across many applications. ARCHAX and others have started to utilize Hedera to tokenize RWAs. However, late 2024 did not see a massive increase in actual use. RWA tokenization is also a neat solution that is still in search of a problem/need. Fractional real estate, financial derivatives, distributed land ownership, diamond tracking/registration/certification are likely to be easily implemented using Hedera (due to low and fixed fee structure and fair ordering of transactions - a must in establishing unambigous ownership)

**Conclusion**

In terms of its major use cases Hedera is not any different from where it was two months ago. Election results, expected crypto friendlienss from the incoming Trump administration are the only factors. These are important (especially for any asset that relies on sentiment and speculative price movement). This optimism around US based crypto projects is great but the network activity and use cases that are active or imminent does not support this huge bump in price. It's likely (not certain) that price goes back significantly as actual use cases are delayed and/or Trump optimisim proves to be more smoke than fire. (That being said holding around .30 over the last week with relatively high volume implies there is buying interest around this price. My suggestion to newcomers: Do not give in to FOMO. Proce has already appreciated significantly on nothing but sentiment and it can easily retract significantly on no major development at all (i.e. we do ont need major bad news for inflated price to go down). I think Hedera is going to be one of the handful of networks that will survive mainstream adoption (and regulation) but do not dive in an all-in kind of strategy. Perhaps adopt a DCA srategy, learn more about the network and start following developments. It's generally a poor idea to invest heavily in an asset that has balloneed 5x in a month. "

How in the world do I go about buying JASMY? I can't seem to find a good option. I tried using metamask to exchange ETH for some JASMY, but the application told me I'd have to pay USD $75+ in gas fees to be able to trade even just a little bit of ETH for JASMY.

Can someone please help? I need to find a way to buy JASMY, I can't get it and I know I have limited time before JASMY makes a move. I want to use a DEX or something for this, but that doesn't seem to exist. I'd even settle for an exchange like tradeogre which is not decentralized, but at least doesn't perform KYC.

So the longer we hold the higher chances of making big with Jasmy! Simple! Though, only thing that may not come true by April is $1 in April or even next year. That’s how I see it! "
