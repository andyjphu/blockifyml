# Speed and Performance: Breaking Speed Records

NordVPN has established itself as the fastest VPN service in 2025, with independent tests from AV-TEST confirming its exceptional performance. The VPN consistently demonstrates minimal speed loss, averaging just an 11% reduction in internet speed. In comparative speed tests, NordVPN outperforms competitors by a significant margin, with impressive download speeds across multiple countries:

\- USA: 417.0 Mbps  
\- UK: 255.9 Mbps  
\- Japan: 527.1 Mbps

The company's speed is attributed to several key factors:  
\- Advanced NordLynx protocol (an adaptation of WireGuard), which is approximately 59% faster than traditional OpenVPN  
\- A robust server infrastructure with 6,800+ servers in 111 countries  
\- Consistent investment in software architecture and network optimization

Notably, NordVPN's speed tests reveal minimal impact on user connectivity:  
\- Upload speed drop: \~4%  
\- Download speed drop: \~6%  
\- Latency increase: Approximately 2,500%

These performance metrics make NordVPN not just a security tool, but a high-speed networking solution for users seeking both privacy and performance.

 

# Security Features That Actually Protect You

NordVPN's security features in 2025 go far beyond basic VPN protection, offering a comprehensive suite of tools to safeguard your online presence:

\- Malware scanning for downloaded files  
\- Real-time protection against phishing attempts  
\- Ad and tracker blocking  
\- URL trimming for enhanced privacy  
\- Cloud-based threat detection

 

**Encryption Standards**

NordVPN employs cutting-edge encryption standards to ensure top-tier security for its users in 2025:

1. AES-256-CBC Encryption  
\- Considered the gold standard in data protection  
\- Used by the U.S. government for top-secret communications  
\- Virtually unbreakable with current technology  
\- Utilized in NordVPN's OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols

2. ChaCha20 Encryption  
\- Implemented in NordVPN's proprietary NordLynx protocol  
\- Optimized for mobile devices and high-speed connections  
\- Uses 256-bit encryption keys, providing robust security  
\- Offers improved performance compared to AES in certain scenarios

3. Quantum-Resilient Encryption  
\- NordVPN introduced post-quantum cryptography support in late 2024  
\- Currently available on Linux clients, with plans to extend to all applications by early 2025  
\- Employs the ML-KEM (Kyber) algorithm for quantum-resistant key exchange  
\- Adds an extra layer of encryption to protect against future quantum computing threats

4. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)  
\- Generates unique encryption keys for each session  
\- Ensures past and future sessions remain secure even if one is compromised

NordVPN's multi-layered encryption approach, combining traditional and quantum-resistant methods, positions it at the forefront of VPN security in 2025, offering users protection against both current and future cryptographic threats.

 

# Advanced Security Features of NordVPN in 2025

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)  
PFS is a critical security feature that generates unique encryption keys for each session.

Here's how it works:

\- Uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to create ephemeral keys  
\- New keys are generated for every connection or at regular intervals  
\- If one key is compromised, only data from that specific session is at risk  
\- Protects past and future communications even if long-term keys are breached  
\- Implemented in NordVPN's OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols

Double VPN  
This feature routes traffic through two VPN servers instead of one, providing:

\- Two layers of encryption for enhanced security  
\- IP address masking twice, making it harder to trace  
\- Separation of entry and exit points, increasing anonymity  
\- Protection against advanced tracking methods

RAM-only Servers  
NordVPN operates exclusively on RAM-only servers,

offering

\- Automatic data wiping upon server restart or power loss  
\- No persistent storage of user data or server configurations  
\- Increased resilience against physical server breaches  
\- Regular server wipes to ensure the latest software versions

Dark Web Monitor

This proactive security tool scans the dark web for compromised credentials

\- Continuously monitors dark web forums and marketplaces  
\- Alerts users if their email address appears in leaked databases  
\- Provides real-time notifications for immediate action  
\- Helps prevent unauthorized access to user accounts

These features, combined with NordVPN's no-logs policy and Panama jurisdiction, create a comprehensive security solution. However, it's important to note that NordVPN may comply with court-ordered data requests in specific legal circumstances, which users should be aware of when considering their privacy needs.

5 coins I would recommend buying right now (with explanations),WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i54bub,2025-01-19 12:52:45,27,0.78,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1i54bub/5_coins_i_would_recommend_buying_right_now_with/,InnerAbrocoma9880,DD,"I'm a day trader with a \~$300K portfolio and here's what I bought yesterday in preparation for the next (hopefully) bull run:

* **Sperax ($SPA)**: massively undervalued since its last pump where it was sitting comfortably at the $0.02 range. It's currently just at $0.014 which I'm confident is the bottom. The ATH of this coin was $0.24, so big potential.
* **Tezos ($XTZ)**: has likely hit the bottom at around $1.30. This coin has reached $10 on previous bull runs. Also on Coinbase, there is up to 7% staking with only a 2-day unstaking time, which is actually really good.
* **Ribbon Finance ($RBN)**: also undervalued. Currently at $0.34, but primed to lock back into the $0.40 - 0.50 range. In the 2024 bull run, it reached $1.80.
* **Pangolin ($PNG)**: undervalued at $0.29. This coin can pump to the $0.70 - 0.80 range on bull runs.
* **Kyber Network ($KNC)**: I've been tracking this coin for years. It tends to dart between the $0.50 and $1 range quite often, so is perfect for trading. But it also reached an instance ATH of $6 a few years ago.

Obviously I'm not a financial adviser, but hopefully these tips are at least useful food for thought. Good luck!"

I know the battery is under warranty through 100k miles this particular year, but this sub makes me comfortable with the battery life with everything I've read here. Are there any particular failures at the 100k-150 mileage mark to be aware of with the hybrid engine?

Social engineering attacks: What MSPs need to know,BarracudaNetworks,1hhozqk,2024-12-19 04:11:25,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarracudaNetworks/comments/1hhozqk/social_engineering_attacks_what_msps_need_to_know/,BarracudaRosey,Email Protection,"*The use of pretexting by hackers (creating a fake story to trick someone into giving out personal information) is increasing. Here's what you need to know.*

[Kevin Williams, Oct. 21, 2024](https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/10/21/social-engineering-attacks--what-msps-need-to-know)

As we kick off Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we are highlighting one danger that managed service providers (MSPs) must constantly monitor: social engineering.

According to Verizon’s [2024 Data Breach Investigations Report:](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:ea:na:8888855284_ds_cid_71700000082349844_ds_agid_58700006959928990&utm_term=verizon%20data%20breach%20report&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=GGL_BND_Security_Phrase&utm_content=Enterprise&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr9m3BhDHARIsANut04ZlMGyidqkWfGOEBZ_qjt_JA5L7R2ur2kUacYPeSaDcwm370skghn8aAtLrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

*Social engineering incidents have increased from the previous year largely due to Pretexting, commonly used in business email compromise (BEC), which almost doubled since last year. Compounding the frequency of these attacks, the median amount stolen from these attacks has also increased over the last couple of years to $50,000.*

The use of pretexting by hackers (creating a fake story to trick someone into giving out personal information) is increasing. According to the Verizon report, the most convincing social engineers can get into your head. They gather information about you and your loved ones to make you believe the message is genuinely from someone you know. Using this invented scenario, they play on your emotions to create a sense of urgency.

# MSP strategies to combat social engineering

“MSPs can create custom phishing detection and employee training programs that are designed specifically for their clients’ environments,” explains Jon Morgan, CEO & Editor-in-Chief of business consulting service, [VentureSmarter.com](http://www.venturesmarter.com/). “Instead of just relying on generic phishing simulations, MSPs can work with their Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to develop targeted simulations based on the specific vulnerabilities and workflows of the organization.”

Morgan explains that simulations can mimic high-level fraudulent wire transfer requests, using a client in the financial sector as an example, and says, “These tailored training programs prepare staff members for attacks that are directly relevant to their specific roles.”

Additionally, Morgan adds that MSPs provide actionable feedback by continuously assessing the simulation results. At the same time, CISOs can audit the effectiveness of these strategies and recommend adjustments.

“MSPs should also implement artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, real-time behavioral analytics systems that are specifically tuned to detect anomalies associated with social engineering tactics,” Morgan recommends. Furthermore, he adds that these tools can flag unusual activities, such as an employee accessing sensitive information they don’t normally handle or logging in from an unfamiliar location. “And CISOs can play a huge role here in auditing and validating these systems to ensure they are properly calibrated to catch signs of social engineering attempts.”

# Enhancing security through collaboration

This combination of an MPS working with an internal CISO allows for real-time monitoring and fast incident response. This is helping to prevent a phishing attempt or compromised account from escalating into a larger breach.

“MSPs can work closely with CISOs to perform detailed risk assessments that identify the most vulnerable entry points for social engineering within each client’s operation,” Morgan advises. “For example, employees who frequently handle financial transactions or HR data may be at higher risk. Based on these assessments, MSPs can design customized incident response plans tailored to each client’s specific needs.

Morgan also emphasizes that MSPs should enforce role-based access controls (RBAC). This practice limits employees’ access to only the data and systems necessary for their jobs. This significantly reduces the damage from social engineering attacks. “Social engineers often target low-level employees to gain access to higher privileges. MSPs can integrate advanced privilege monitoring tools that alert when unusual access requests or privilege escalations occur.”

# Additional measures MSPs should take

Meanwhile, Cache Merrill, founder of software developer Zibtek, offers [SmarterMSP.com](http://www.smartermsp.com/) readers some additional steps:

**Strengthen human weakness**: “There is a need for providing proper and continuing education of employees on active defense methods such as social engineering methods, as well as for performing periodic practice exercises with them,” Merrill says, adding that threats and attacks are always present. Testing keeps alertness high and helps maintain readiness.

**Social media awareness**: “Some attackers disguised as employees of an organization may use personal information and other details acquired from social network sites to persuade individuals to disclose sensitive information,” Merrill warns, urging policymakers to collaborate with clients and develop policies covering the ways of using social networking sites to avoid sharing of sensitive or personal information by employees.

**Incident response planning**: “An effective MSP incident response plan that is kept up-to-date and regularly revised and practiced enables both the service provider and their clients to be prepared from the moment that any breach occurs,” Merrill advises, adding that time is of the essence in responding to these sorts of attacks which way limits the damage from a social engineering attack.

**Creating a cybersecurity culture**: Merrill recommends that MSPs should establish a cyber safety culture within the client structures. This will help deter social engineering attacks. “Social engineering is a dynamic aspect of the threat landscape. It is important to cultivate a culture where every staff knows she or he plays a part in the security.”

# Prioritizing social engineering threats

As Cybersecurity Awareness Month unfolds, MSPs must prioritize the threat that comes from social engineering tactics. By implementing best practices and tactics, MSPs can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture. Adhering to these strategies will protect MSPs and their clients from financial and reputational damage. This proactive approach helps mitigate the risks associated with social engineering attacks. It will also strengthen the overall cybersecurity infrastructure against future vulnerabilities.

Vượt tường lửa / Mở chặn kiểm duyệt không dùng VPN,TroChuyenLinhTinh,1h9cnbu,2024-12-08 01:20:53,17,0.9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TroChuyenLinhTinh/comments/1h9cnbu/vượt_tường_lửa_mở_chặn_kiểm_duyệt_không_dùng_vpn/,DarJas,,"....
....

Xin chào các bạn, chắc các bạn cũng đã quá quen thuộc với việc bị kiểm duyệt nội dung khi lướt web, và việc vượt kiểm duyệt cũng không lạ gì nữa.

Có rất nhiều cách để vượt kiểm duyệt như: Đổi DNS, dùng VPN hay proxy, dùng DNS mã hóa... và dùng VPN dường như là cách thông dụng nhất để vượt kiểm duyệt.

Cũng có những cách vượt kiểm duyệt khác mà hôm nay mình muốn thảo luận ở đây là vượt kiểm duyệt ngay tại thiết bị mà bạn sử dụng, không cần phải ""du lịch"" sang các nơi khác/nước khác.

Xin lỗi một số từ có thể gây khó hiểu cho các bạn, các bạn có thể tra Google giúp mình với nhé!

1. Ép buộc sử dụng DNS chỉ định để kiểm duyệt: Hiện tại các nhà mạng (ISP) đã triển khai việc chuyển tiếp cổng 53 dùng cho việc phân giải tên miền sang địa chỉ IP sang các máy chủ phân giải tên miền (DNS) của họ. Nên việc các bạn sự cài DNS riêng như của Google/CLoudFlare/OpenDNS/Quad9... đều vô tác dụng. Để biết bạn đang sử dụng DNS nào thì các bạn có thể vào trang [https://browserleaks.com/dns](https://browserleaks.com/dns) hay [https://ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net) sẽ rõ.

Để giải quyết vấn đề này bạn nên sử dụng DNS mã hóa (DNS thường sử dụng cổng 53): Tham khảo chi tiết tại [HostsVN/NextDNS](https://github.com/bigdargon/hostsVN/wiki/NextDNS)

2. Kiểm duyệt bằng Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): Cách này thì hầu như các ISP đều áp dụng khi bạn đã vượt qua  kiểm duyệt ""1."" ở trên. Dù cho bạn dùng DNS mã hóa đi chăng nữa thì khi bạn kết nối tới máy chủ https thì vẫn phải ""say hi"" nó cái đã, và khi chào kiểu này lại không được mã hóa, và vì thế bị ISP kiểm duyệt.

Bạn gõ từ khóa DPI bypass sẽ ra nhiều cách, ở đây mình giới thiệu các bạn

a. DPYProxy: [DPYProxy](https://github.com/UPB-SysSec/DPYProxy) dùng được cho cả Android/Windows/Linux/MacOS
    
a1. Để sử dụng được DPYProxy bạn phải cài Python và dnspython: Bạn sử dụng hệ điều hành(OS) nào thì search cách cài tương ứng cho OS đó, Android thì chạy lên Termux

a2. Bạn tải và giải nén DPYProxy từ link sau: [DPYProxy.zip](https://github.com/UPB-SysSec/DPYProxy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
a3. Chạy lệnh bên dưới
>python3 main.py --port 1180 --record_frag
>
a4. Mở trình duyệt lên chỉnh proxy: máy chủ [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1) hay localhost, còn cổng là 1180.
P/s: Nếu bạn thích dùng cổng khác thì đổi cổng 1180 nhưng cổng proxy cài ở trình duyệt cũng phải đổi giống vậy. Bạn có thể thạy lệnh sau để tìm hiểu thêm các chức năng của scrips: python3 main.py -h

b. Dùng Kyber/MLKem: Cách này đỡ phải chạy scripts ngoài nhưng trình duyệt bạn phải hỗ trợ mới sử dụng được. Link tham khảo phiên bản trình duyệt đã hỗ trợ: [CloudFlare](https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com)
Trình duyệt phải sử dụng DNS mã hóa mới sử dụng được Kyber/MLKem nhé!
Bạn có thể xem hướng dẫn bật DNS mã hóa tại đây: 
Máy tính: [HostsVN/NextDNS](https://github.com/bigdargon/hostsVN/wiki/NextDNS#1-tr%C3%ACnh-duy%E1%BB%87t)
Android:
+FireFox: Nhập vào đường dẫn about:config dành cho FireFox trên PC, còn Android là > chrome://geckoview/content/config.xhtml
Nhập vào network.trr.mode và chỉnh giá trị thành 3
Nhập vào network.trr.custom_uri và chỉnh giá trị thành đường dẫn DNS mã hóa (Ví dụ như https://doh3.dns.nextdns.io)
Nhập vào kyber, xem đã bật (true) chưa, nếu chưa thì bạn bật lên.
+Chrome: Nên dùng Brave và Banana Browser hỗ trợ MLKem, còn Kiwi Browser chỉ hỗ trợ DoH+ECH
Nhập vào đường dẫn chrome://flags, nhập tiếp vào kyber/mlkem xem đã bật (enable) chưa, nếu chưa thì bạn bật lên và cài DNS mã hóa (Ví dụ như https://doh3.dns.nextdns.io).

Kiểm tra:
+Vào link [CloudFlare](https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com) xem dòng ""post-quantum secure"" màu xanh lá cây là ok.
+Tiếp theo bạn có thể vào các trang ở mục POLR hay HUMR ở link bên dưới để kiểm tra: [CitiZenLab/vn.csv](https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/vn.csv)

Ở mục 2a và 2b thì bạn vượt kiểm duyệt không cần dùng VPN, nhưng ISP vẫn biết bạn vào IP nào rồi có thể tra ngược lại tên miền nhé! Nhưng nhiều tên miền cùng sử dụng 1 IP thì cũng hơi mệt à. Hoặc máy chủ dùng của Cloudflare cũng vậy.

2a chạy tool bên ngoài trình duyệt mở máy chủ proxy, và trình duyệt kết nối vào máy chủ proxy đó. Tất nhiên máy chủ cũng chỉ nội bộ chứ không định tuyến đi đâu cả. Ngoài DPYProxy (DPYProxy bypass được vạn lý tường lửa của khựa) ra còn nhiều tool khác có chức năng tương tự: [DPI bypass Github](https://www.google.com/search?q=DPI+bypass+github)

2b dùng mã hóa lượng tử trên trình duyệt mã hóa luôn cả ""say hi"" nên ISP không kiểm duyệt bằng DPI được.

Mời các bạn thảo luận tiếp và đóng góp thêm đường dẫn hoặc liên kết bị kiểm duyệt vào [CitiZenLab/vn.csv](https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/vn.csv) để kiểm tra với nhé!

What cyberware would Darth Vader/Anakin (Star wars) or Luke skywalker choose (Cyberpunk 2020/2077)? Sandevistans or Cyberdeck or Sandevistan-CD hybrids?,whowouldwin,1h2kpfi,2024-11-29 07:27:24,5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1h2kpfi/what_cyberware_would_darth_vaderanakin_star_wars/,marco147,Challenge,"Because cyberware in star wars should be on par with Mekton zeta or Starblade battalion, JUST KIDDING. Imagine the Sandevistans or Cyberdecks basically have a mini Kyber crystal/lightsaber crystal to explain the time dilation magic.

(Kerenzikovs are there yes, but they're boosterware. not speedware. 2077 Zikovs also seem to behave like the sandevistan-presumably they have a constant slow-down mode. and a burst mode that acts like the Sandevistan but much shorter in duration and of less intensity-One could assume General Grievous to be running boosterware given his superhuman reflexes to the point of intercepting blaster bolts with his lightsabers or either running a sandy and a kerz together. albeit at exponential sanity/humanity damage)

For how common they would be (I.e if used by Ventress, Grievous. Maul.etc). consider the price of a sandi (including Cyberdeck-sandevistan hybrids like the MK3 and below Raven cybernetics, and MK4 Arasaka 'Nightmare' or MK5 Netwatch-QianT 'Rage) to be such that while they are considered 'rudimentary' by top-level mercs/bounty hunters like the Fetts. a Dynalar or Zetatech may be the only thing mid-level mercs or jedi knight equivalent or sith or other notable main or side characters paying out of pocket can afford. with Falcons becoming more common and QianT Warp Dancers and Apogees becoming widespread (Albeit still very expensive due to widespread need for natural and synthetic kyber crystals to manufacture these specific cyberware) at the top level.

For knock-on effects in regards to non-force sensitive Sandy or Zikov users with lightsabers and such. Consider lightsabers to be available for them but at a equally expensive cost (I.e Jango fett with a Falcon may use a lightsaber, but only uses it when activating the Falcon. Same thing with Cad Bane and a highly modified/upgraded Dynalar. and a low-level bounty hunter/merc may not even have one at all)

Militech/David's Apogee Sandevistan-Time is slowed down by 85%. Base cooldown of 30 secs. Final acceleration factor:Time is slowed down to 15%.

Kerenzikov (2077 era):MK2s slow down time to 70% constantly, while MK5s slow down time to 55% constantly. In burst/Sandy mode. slows down time to 40% for 2-3.75 secs. Cooldown 8-6 secs. Is especially jarring to adapt to since the user must cope with retraining their muscle hand-eye coordination and gait to cope with essentially Force speed/superhuman reflexes. Non-force sensitives using a lightsaber are considered to be for all purposes 'force sensitive' (i.e they can wield a lightsaber effectively) due to boosted reflexes. (Sandevistan users can also be effective in lightsabers too-i.e Jango fett with a Falcon keeping up with Mace windu and escaping alive in a sort of AU, but since a Sandi is not constantly on like a Kerenzikov, a Zikov lightsaber user will always be more experienced than a Sandy user)

Nanorelays/Boostmaster:Increase sandevistan duration by 2 secs. Increase Kerenzikov acceleration/time slowdown factor by 5%.

Heatsink-Refer to the TTRPG sourcebook or the 2077 stats

SX Smasher Sandevistan/Omagatoki Sandevistan- Time is slowed down to 10% for 10-20 relative seconds. 20 seconds of cooldown.

Tier 5/Legendary Cyberdecks- Allows wireless hacking or physical hacking (evil maid attacks) of technology (up to and including physical access to starships) and full net immersion/Deep-dive hacking. Consider it to be the same as R2-D2's evil maid hacking. and for quickhacks against droids (and any other robotic or AI targets with a wireless connection) to be on par with a netrunner V.

Netwatch-QianT 'Rage' MK5 hybrid sandevistan cyberdeck-Time is slowed down to 15% for 12 secs. Base cooldown of 20-25 secs. Cyberdeck is on par with a Tier 4. As such, consider it to be a somewhat worse version of R2-D2. or a highly leveled (but not endgame) Netrunner V.

Arasaka 'Nightmare' sandi-deck MK4- Time is slowed down to 30% for 8 secs. Base cool down 20-30 seconds. Cyberdeck on par with a Tier 3.

Militech 'RX' Blackwall Sandevistan -Time is slowed down to 10% for 15 secs. When active, Force Drain enhances all lightsaber or melee attacks (Sufficiently weakened targets will be insta-killed as if drained by Darth nihilius. while robotic targets get blackwall gateway or simply get fried with having their data scattered instead.   In essence, the RX Sandevistan's Force drain scatters a consciousness across several servers or the entire solar system turning them into a Distiributed Network AI, in effect reducing a organic target to a vegetative state or corrupting droid code into junk-code scattered across several servers. or against True AI driving them insane) Note that this requires a 'True AI' or a engram. so Anakin or Luke will end up with pretty much a Halo-esque Cortana or a Force ghost in their head.

Millitech Canto-Apogee RX Cyberdeck- Same as all MK5 cyberdecks. Same acceleration factor as the Apogee and same duration. seconds. Base cooldown 25 seconds. Requires either a True AI or a Engram or a Force ghost housed and living on it for its full potential just like the RX Sandevistan.  Against Robotic, Droid and AI targets. Blackwall Gateway scatters their data across several servers as far as possible. If this attack would destroy the droid or AI in question, Droids and other robot synths are shut down irreversibly while AIs are either turned into corrupt junk-code or driven insane (like what Bartmoss's RABIDS do). Against computers and databases, this instead irreversibly scatters their data into the HoloNET and any local NETs for everyone to see i.e Datakrash.

For damage to sanity from cyberware. consider it a question of whether deep down they want to be better than organics in seeing them as nothing more than a set of replaceable details. or hold it together with no superiority complex. with Sandevistan. slowing down time forces Anakin/Luke to focus in and soak every traumatic experience if they happen.

Note that Jedi and Sith or force sensitives can see and detect a active sandevistan from the motion trail/afterimages. to droids or normal targets they just appear as a blur instead.  
Funnily enough, this causes a situation in where sandevistan users pay attention to when the other is going to activate theirs cause they must be able to counter it as well. Consider this to be the same for a non-force sensitive with a sandevistan against a Force sensitive (Jedi/sith) using Force speed."

"Heard about Rivalz OCY DePIN? Developers, get ready for a new Hackathon...",altcoin_news,1gzg3x2,2024-11-25 05:46:11,5,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin_news/comments/1gzg3x2/heard_about_rivalz_ocy_depin_developers_get_ready/,TheFlamingoPower,Discussion,"Been geeking out on decentralized infrastructure lately, and I gotta say, Rivalz’s OCY DePIN has me seriously impressed. If you’re into AI, DePIN, or just curious about how data is evolving, let me share why I think OCY is crushing it.

**OCY DePIN** (Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure Network) is a revolutionary framework designed to transform how data is processed, stored, and retrieved in the AI era.

Okay, most projects talk about encryption, but OCY’s on another level. It uses fancy stuff like **Crystal-Kyber (post-quantum encryption)** and **FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)**, which means your data stays safe and private - even while it’s being processed. No prying eyes. Not even Rivalz can see it.

OCY will be used within all over modules in the Rivalz Abstraction Layer going forward.

With unrivaled security, AI-specific optimizations, and a commitment to scalability, OCY is **the future of decentralized AI infrastructure**.

Soon they will be announcing a Hackathon for builders to elevate OCY to a new level. 

I tried to explain it to you in brief. Have you seen this latest news yet? 

I admit, Rivalz Network is doing great things, they have a very promising future ahead of them."

Is Quarden Token Legit? Seeking Insights from the Community,Scams,1guekqi,2024-11-18 15:25:41,15,0.82,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1guekqi/is_quarden_token_legit_seeking_insights_from_the/,Imaginary-Ad-3965,⚠️ SCAM ALERT ⚠️,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently come across Quarden Token, which markets itself as a blockchain-enabled e-commerce and payment platform. Their whitepaper describes features like decentralized exchanges, instant currency conversions, and cross-chain compatibility. They also claim to support merchants and users with APIs and a ""Currency Looping Protocol"" to optimize exchange rates.

While the concept sounds promising, I’m cautious about investing. Here are some specifics:

* **They require a $270 minimum investment** during their pre-sale. I initially planned to invest $100 but was told that’s not possible.
* The project seems similar to others like Kyber Network and 0x. I’m unsure how Quarden is differentiating itself.
* Most articles I found about them, including ones on sites like StreetInsider, seem to be promotional or press releases rather than independent reviews.
* Their roadmap in the whitepaper mentions phases from 2017–2018, but I couldn’t find evidence of those phases being implemented.

I’m hoping someone here has experience with Quarden or knows more about their track record. Have you used their platform, or do you know if they’ve achieved any real-world adoption?

Also, are there any red flags I might have missed? I’m open to hearing both positive and critical perspectives.

Thanks in advance for your input!"
