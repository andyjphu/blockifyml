"🚀 Solana DeFi Weekly: Best APYs, New Farms & Alpha (Jan 25, 2025) 🚀",DeFiYieldClub,1i9vwm8,2025-01-25 15:15:42,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9vwm8/solana_defi_weekly_best_apys_new_farms_alpha_jan/,Solanafluent,,"Hey **DeFi Yield Club** fam! It's time for another Solana-only yield farming update! Whether you're staking, lending, or farming, here’s what's hot right now in the **Solana DeFi** ecosystem.

# 🔥 1. Best Solana Staking & Lending Yields This Week

# Liquid Staking & Validator Staking APYs:

* **JitoSOL** – **9.84% APY** (MEV-boosted staking)
* **Marinade (mSOL)** – **8.4% APY**, with auto-compounding options
* **Blazestake (bSOL**) **8.63 APY** with auto-compounding options
* **The Vault (vSOL)** \- **9.59 APY** with auto-compounding options

# Lending & Borrowing Yields:

* **Kamino:** 15%+ APY on auto-compounded SOL-stable pairs
* **Drift:** SOL perpetual funding rates fluctuate, sometimes hitting double-digit APY

💡 *These APYs shift fast! Always check on-chain before entering a position.*

# 🌱 2. New & Noteworthy Solana Farms

🚀 **Top Opportunities Right Now:**

* Meteora’s New Vaults – Optimized LP yields with 20%+ APY on SOL-stable pairs
* Kamino K-Lending Expansion – Higher TVL & better leveraged SOL yield strategies

💬 *Are you farming in any of these? Let’s hear your experiences!*

# 🧠 3. Community Insights & Strategies

🔥 **Top Strategy This Week: Looping SOL for Max APY**

💡 **How it works:**

* Stake SOL for vSOL or JupSOL (Jupiter’s liquid staking token)
* Use vSOL or JupSOL as collateral on Kamino’s Multiply feature
* Borrow more SOL → Restake → Repeat

**Why Kamino & Jupiter?**

* **Kamino Multiply** automates the looping process for max efficiency.
* **Jupiter** ensures optimal swap rates for rebalancing positions.

📌 **Risk Reminder:** Higher leverage = higher rewards, but also higher liquidation risk. Monitor your LTV and adjust accordingly.

# Final Thoughts

Solana DeFi is popping off right now with new vaults, better lending markets, and innovative staking plays. Whether you're compounding rewards or farming, maximize your strategy and stay updated!

Trading memecoins: A complete guide,Kraken,1i8zpx9,2025-01-24 11:43:03,2,0.55,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kraken/comments/1i8zpx9/trading_memecoins_a_complete_guide/,krakenexchange,Learn :Kraken_logo:,"# Key takeaways

1. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that pay tribute to memes, celebrities, animals and viral internet trends.
2. Successful memecoin trading requires thorough research to avoid scams, careful evaluation of community strength and liquidity factors, and adherence to best practices for risk management.
3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins 💻

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke. 

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars’ worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they’re highly volatile — even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them. 

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins 📍

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge), [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe) do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/) and [Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

[Download Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet)

# How to trade memecoins on centralized crypto exchanges 📝

As touched on above, Kraken boasts a wide selection of popular memecoins, which can be traded just as easily as any other asset. You can perform direct cash-to-crypto swaps in a few clicks, or set up more advanced orders (such as [recurring buys](https://www.kraken.com/learn/finance/dollar-cost-averaging) or [limit orders](https://www.kraken.com/learn/trading/trade-orders)) with ease.

At the time of this writing, Kraken supports [20+ popular memecoins](https://www.kraken.com/categories/meme), including:

* [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogecoin)
* [Shiba Inu (SHIB)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/shiba-inu)
* [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pepe)
* [Bonk (BONK)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/bonk)
* [Dogwifhat (WIF)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogwifhat)
* [FLOKI (FLOKI)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/floki)
* [SPX6900 (SPX)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/spx6900)
* [Popcat (POPCAT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/popcat)
* [Mog Coin (MOG)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/mog-coin)
* [Gigachad (GIGA)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/gigachad)
* [Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/peanut-the-squirrel)

To get started, all you need is a Kraken account and as little as $10.

# Key considerations for memecoin trading 🧐

As with any investment, [doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor) is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that **memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers — taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it’s easy for bad actors to ‘astroturf’ on social media — making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you’ll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength. 

An example of a potential red flag is an [LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens) that hasn’t been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide, [How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like [Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/) or [Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/) can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:** a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:** take a look at the project’s Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:** as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn’t, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:** can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading 📚

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders. 

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable. 

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading 📖

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that **the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space — ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

"Crypto to get Trump taskforce, Ross freed, AI coins soar",bitfate,1i8vkkx,2025-01-24 08:38:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i8vkkx/crypto_to_get_trump_taskforce_ross_freed_ai_coins/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨Just IN: Crypto Space Heats Up with Regulatory Shifts and New Developments

In a significant move, the SEC has launched a new crypto task force aimed at setting a sensible regulatory path for the cryptocurrency industry. Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as ""crypto mom"" for her supportive stance on crypto innovation, this task force marks a shift from the previous enforcement-heavy approach to clearer regulation and guidance[3].

Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has hinted at the possibility of delisting Tether's USDT if it fails to comply with upcoming U.S. regulations. The potential new rules could require stablecoin issuers to back their tokens entirely with U.S. Treasury bonds and undergo periodic audits. Armstrong emphasized Coinbase's commitment to compliance and helping users transition to more secure assets[1][5].

In other news, President-elect Donald Trump has launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, which saw its market capitalization soar to several billion dollars shortly after its launch. Despite initial skepticism, the coin's popularity has been fueled by announcements on Trump's official social media channels. However, experts caution against the speculative nature of meme coins[2].

On the legislative front, the new administration is expected to work with Congress on stablecoin and market structure reforms, further defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC in crypto regulations. A crypto council is also in the works to develop new regulatory policies, making 2025 a pivotal year for the crypto space[3].

In corporate news, Circle has acquired Hashnote for an undisclosed amount, and Solana's stablecoin supply has seen a 60% increase since Friday. Justin Sun has outlined a plan to push Ethereum to $10,000, and Jupiter is set to airdrop $630 million in JUP tokens. Bitcoin miners are enjoying tripled profit margins, and BTC mining has reportedly saved Texas $18 billion[3].

Riot Platforms is pivoting to AI data centers, and CLS Global has pleaded guilty to wash trading. CryptoCom has relaunched its US exchange, and KULR has bought another $8 million in BTC. Finland has launched its first-ever crypto ETPs, and the banking industry, led by BofA CEO, is ready to embrace crypto[3].

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, MicroStrategy shareholders have approved more BTC purchases, and Rex Shares has filed for ETFs related to $TRUMP, DOGE, and BONK. A Texas court has reversed sanctions on Tornado Cash, and there are plans to converge traditional finance and crypto, according to the Financial Times[3].

Jupiter announces $630 million JUP airdrop on Solana,CapitalistExploits,1i8vf1i,2025-01-24 08:30:44,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i8vf1i/jupiter_announces_630_million_jup_airdrop_on/,kayakero,,"Jupiter, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Solana network, is preparing to launch a massive airdrop of 700 million JUP tokens, valued at approximately $630 million at the current price.

According to the official announcement, the event will take place this Wednesday, January 22, and will allow around 2 million eligible wallets to claim their tokens.

https://preview.redd.it/pxnseum33lee1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae81e01894117cc1e1b57a99f07961bc94ac50c9

# Before the airdrop: JUP price drops

Prior to the airdrop announcement, the price of the JUP token fell by 4.5% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.86 at the time of writing, according to data from CoinGecko. This decline represents a 25% drop from its recent high of $1.20, which was reached following a surge in trading on Solana DEXs.

https://preview.redd.it/w9w4vj253lee1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1a64b64690fa25d1218b2b470532031698e62c7

# Airdrop details and how to participate

Jupiter has set specific rules for claiming JUP tokens:

* **Claim Period:** Users will have three months to claim their tokens, which seeks to avoid congestion on the Solana network and minimize gas fees.
* **Jupuary Profile:** Each wallet will need to create a Jupuary profile, providing an email address.
* **Abuse Prevention:** Users flagged as bots or Sybils will be able to appeal their cases after January 27.

Jupiter also warned against potential scams and fraudulent sites that could take advantage of the event, urging participants to always check official sources.

# Previous airdrops and their impact on the market

This is the second major airdrop organized by Jupiter. In January 2024, the platform distributed 1 billion JUP tokens, which boosted the token price to a record high of $2. However, since then, the token's value has seen a 55% correction, standing at $0.90.

The decision to conduct two new airdrops in 2025 and 2026 was taken after a vote in the Jupiter DAO, with 87% approval. In contrast, a previous plan for a $1.7 billion airdrop was rejected in December 2024 for not reaching the necessary 70% threshold.

With millions of eligible wallets, this event promises to generate a lot of movement in the market, despite the recent drop in the token price.

So I am eligible for only 210 JUP this drop. Is it worth it to set up Jupiter Mobile? How much more JUP will I get that way compared to claiming and staking on the desktop jup.ag? Are there any other benefits of the mobile version?

Also, if anyone can explain if I need two separate apps (Exchange and wallet) or if one app contains both features?

Edit: Thanks for the responses. I'll set it up now. I checked the megathread too. If someone could drop their invite code below, that would be nice."

How To Use BONKbot,bonkbotdegens,1i7pegm,2025-01-22 18:32:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bonkbotdegens/comments/1i7pegm/how_to_use_bonkbot/,AnxiousVanilla9097,,"**Beginner's Guide to Using BONKbot**

[***See full guide on the Official BONKbot Site***](https://bonkbot.io/library/how-to-use-bonkbot)

If you’re new to crypto or just looking for a straightforward guide, this walkthrough will help you get started with BONKbot in no time. From setting up your wallet to buying and selling tokens, we’ve got you covered!

# Step 1: Set Up a Solana Wallet

Before using BONKbot, you’ll need a Solana wallet like **Phantom** or **Solflare**. These wallets are user-friendly and secure, making it easy to manage your funds. Once you’ve set up your wallet, make sure to store your seed phrase in a safe place—it’s your access key to your funds and cannot be recovered if lost.

# Step 2: Fund Your Wallet with SOL

To start trading, you’ll need to add funds to your wallet. You can do this through popular exchanges like **Binance** or **Coinbase**. First, purchase USDC (a stablecoin) on the exchange, then send it to your Solana wallet. Be sure to transfer it on the Solana network, not Ethereum. Once it’s in your wallet, use [Jupiter Exchange](https://jup.ag/swap/USDC-SOL) to swap your USDC for Solana (SOL), which you’ll use for trading on BONKbot.

# Step 3: Start BONKbot on Telegram

Download the Telegram app and search for **Bonkbot\_bot** to get started. Tap **Start** or type **/start**, and BONKbot will initialize your wallet. You’re now ready to trade!

# Step 4: Deposit SOL to BONKbot

Send a small amount of SOL from your wallet to the address provided by BONKbot. Once the transfer is complete, type **/start** again to refresh your wallet and confirm your balance.

# Step 5: Buying Tokens

With your wallet funded, you can start buying tokens. Simply paste the token address into the BONKbot chat, and a **Buy** button will appear. Select the amount of SOL you’d like to spend and confirm the transaction. BONKbot processes the trade instantly, making it quick and hassle-free.

# Step 6: Managing Your Portfolio

After your first purchase, BONKbot will keep track of your portfolio and provide real-time updates. You can monitor key metrics like your current profit (both in percentages and USD), market cap, price changes over time, and net profit after fees. This makes it easy to stay informed and adjust your trading strategy as needed.

# Step 7: Selling Tokens

When you’re ready to sell, go to the **Sell & Manage** menu, select the token you want to sell, and choose the amount. BONKbot will handle the transaction and convert your tokens back into SOL. If you have multiple positions, you can navigate through them to buy more or sell as needed.

# BONKbot Settings

BONKbot is designed for simplicity, but there are customization options to enhance your experience. You can toggle features like auto-buy, adjust slippage settings, and configure buy/sell buttons to match your trading style. For more advanced settings, check out recommendations from the BONKbot mods and developers.

BONKbot makes crypto trading accessible and efficient, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced trader. Ready to dive in? Set up your wallet, fund it with SOL, and start trading today!

Jupiter Set to Drop $630 Million Worth of JUP in Solana Airdrop Claim,SolanaMemeDaily,1i7fzeo,2025-01-22 12:04:33,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeDaily/comments/1i7fzeo/jupiter_set_to_drop_630_million_worth_of_jup_in/,SpawneRisLit,,"https://preview.redd.it/o377o8f8ukee1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=db972a1c0dc6c530a353d13cb9ba402d2361fb01

JUP, the native token of the [Solana](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps)\-based decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter, has fallen by 3% in the last 24 hours to a current price of $0.90 as the platform prepares to open its latest airdrop claim. 

The token has dropped 25% from its local high price of $1.20 as the token jumped over the weekend as [decentralized exchange](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex)—or DEX—trading volumes exploded. Solana DEXs [more than tripled](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/solana) their previous weekly marks according to DefiLlama, boosted by the launch of President [Donald Trump’s Solana meme coin](https://decrypt.co/301691/donald-trump-drops-solana-meme-coin). 

After announcing its [airdrop eligibility checker](https://decrypt.co/301126/solana-defi-exchange-jupiter-airdrop-checker) last week, Jupiter signaled early Tuesday that it will open claims for its latest airdrop on Wednesday, January 22 at 10:30am ET. 

Approximately 2 million eligible wallets across three separate buckets of users will be able to claim a share of 700 million total JUP tokens, worth $630 million at current prices. 

But Jupiter is urging users to take caution, suggesting that [“Solana may be congested”](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1881685676087013741) and “gas can be expensive,” and indicating that eligible wallets will have up to three months to claim their tokens—so there’s no rush.

In order to do so, users will be required to create a Jupiter profile which requires use of an email address. Users with more than one eligible wallet will be required to claim each one individually.

  
This latest Jupuary airdrop was confirmed via a passed [DAO proposal,](https://decrypt.co/295635/solana-defi-exchange-jupiter-airdrops-1-7-billion) which achieved the support of more than 87% of voters who agreed to have Jupiter hold two separate airdrops of 700 million JUP tokens apiece in 2025 and 2026. 

Jupiter held its [first airdrop](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-jupiter-jup-what-you-need-to-know-about-its-airdrop-on-solana) of JUP in January 2024, granting 1 billion tokens to wallets that had interacted with its products. JUP hit an all-time high of $2.00 a week after launch, but has since retraced 55% to its current price of $0.90."

I installed Google Chrome web browser and added the coinbase wallet extension. (I had to link my CB Wallet using my 12 word security phrase). Now I have access to my wallet from my PC.

Next I opened Jupiter web site using Chrome. From Jupiter, I clicked on the ""Connect Wallet"" button. Proceeded to add my catch phrase again. Now I have the ability to find and swap / buy new projects as they are being listed. 

Went back a couple hours later and all my crypto is missing from my coinbase wallet. I am trying to find it. I'm not feeling too good about it. All the crypto was sent to the same address. Took about 5 minutes.

I suspect this was a Phish and it's all gone. Tough lesson to learn. All funds lost started with throw-away cash. No major financial impact. Just a gut punch.

I noticed I am missing any mention of Solana as a network in my wallet. I tried looking at the networks. All I now have is Ethereum, Base and Polygon. Within the settings area, Solana is unavailable anywhere in Mainnets or Testnets.

Do I have any recourse? Can I get access to Solana in my wallet?

Any help would be greatly appreciated  Thanks."

How to Buy,HegeCoin,1i60jq9,2025-01-20 15:44:33,16,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/comments/1i60jq9/how_to_buy/,UncleFred-,,"# How to Buy Hege

The most popular method for buying Solana-based memecoins is to use a a hot wallet. Hot wallets are applications that exist independent of a centralized exchange (CEX). The most popular of these for Hege buyers are [Phantom](https://phantom.com/) and [Solflare ](https://gamma.solflare.com/download)wallet. As an alternative, you can buy Hege on an ever-growing list of CEXs. These include: [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/HEGE_USDT?_from=search), [LBANK](https://www.lbank.com/trade/hege_usdt), [INDOEX](https://www.indoex.io/trade/HEGE_USDT), [AscendEX](https://ascendex.com/en/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/hege), [BitMart](https://www.bitmart.com/trade/en-US?symbol=HEGE_USDT), and [BVOX](https://www.bvox.com/exchange/HEGE/USDT).

# 1. Set up a Phantom Wallet

* Download the **Phantom Wallet** browser extension or mobile app from [phantom.app](https://phantom.app/).
* Create a new wallet and securely store your 12-word seed phrase offline. This is your key to accessing your wallet. **NEVER** share you seed phrase(s) with **anyone**.

# 2. Fund your Wallet

* Open Phantom Wallet and click Buy.
* Pick Solana, input your desired amount, and Phantom will load quotes from payment providers.
* Choose a payment provider (e.g., MoonPay, Transak, and many others depending on your region). Alternatively, you can load your Phantom Wallet from your preferred crypto exchange.
* **Payment provider:** Follow the instructions to purchase SOL using your credit/debit card or other supported payment methods. Once complete, the SOL will appear in your wallet.



https://reddit.com/link/1i60jq9/video/9zxw84qwacee1/player

* **CEX of choice:** You can buy Solana, USDC or USDT on an exchange like [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/prices/solana), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/en-ca/price/solana), or [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/solana) and transfer the tokens to your Phantom Wallet. Note that some exchanges require you to select the on-chain type of USDC or USDT. If so, pick Solana (SPL). Be sure to avoid USDC/USDT Etherium (ERC-20). The Etherium version requires extra steps to transfer to Phantom Wallet. Some buyers choose USDC or USDT as these tokens are pegged to the US dollar and may avoid regional purchase limits. It's recommended to stick to Solana for new users.
* Transfer from CEX: In Phantom Wallet, copy your wallet's Solana address. Select the receive button. On the new panel, select the copy button:

https://preview.redd.it/7d3fb09me7ee1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=92dc45592cec91690f6630c24f10937394a2c9ad

* Paste this address into the ""send"" or ""transfer"" address on your exchange. Always double check your address is correct. You may lose your money if you paste the wrong alphanumeric text.
* Your exchange may have additional verification steps. These may include an email confirmation or two-factor authentication step before it clears a transfer.

# 3. Exchange Solana for Hege

* You can exchange Solana for Hege directly in Phantom Wallet. However, this is not the recommended method. You can take advantage of larger decentralized exchanges like [Jupiter ](https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-HEGE)and [Raydium](https://raydium.io/swap/?inputMint=sol&outputMint=ULwSJmmpxmnRfpu6BjnK6rprKXqD5jXUmPpS1FxHXFy) to lower your transaction costs.
* Visit [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-HEGE), a decentralized exchange aggregator for the Solana network.
* Connect your Phantom Wallet by clicking the **Connect Wallet** button.

* The links above will take you directly to the SOL **→** HEGE pairing. However, it's common for scammers to add fake copy-cat tokens to exchanges. To ensure you are using the correct token, copy the official Hege contract address: ULwSJmmpxmnRfpu6BjnK6rprKXqD5jXUmPpS1FxHXFy

* A token's official address can be verified on its [official website](https://www.hegecoin.com/), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hege/) or [Dexscreener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/cjcu7cirhbhu4bdnplgaum1a6isp9ruhjmg36rjjrxnd).

* Enter the amount of Solana you want to swap for Hege. Jupiter will calculate the equivalent amount of Hege and show the best rate.
* Complete the transaction.
* You may get a transaction error. This can be any number of things, but it's typically either A) The transaction is no longer available and you need to try again, or; B) You don't have enough leftover Solana to cover the costs of the transaction. Likewise, it's also possible to get an error even though the transaction completed.

# 4. Verify the $HEGE Tokens in Your Wallet

* After the swap, Hege should appear in your Phantom Wallet. If it doesn't, manually add it by using the contract address.
* It typically takes 10-30 seconds to see the balance in your Phantom wallet. Note that high-traffic events may see additional complications. Centralized exchanges can be particularly vulnerable to purchase failures, delays, and balance display glitches. For example, Coinbase transactions have experienced hours of delays in past high-traffic events."

A simple guide for crypto newbies - all are welcome in HegeCoin!,HegeCoin,1i5odjq,2025-01-20 06:44:16,53,0.99,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/comments/1i5odjq/a_simple_guide_for_crypto_newbies_all_are_welcome/,HegeFaceAsh,Serious,"A Quick Step-by-Step Guide to Onboarding to Crypto and Buying $HEGE on Solana

*For ease of getting started this guide only explains using Phantom wallet, Jupiter exchange, and other basics. To sign up with centralized exchanges, look to popular ones like Coinbase or Binance.* 

*DYOR + NFA.*  


# 1. Set Up a Phantom Wallet

* Download the **Phantom Wallet** browser extension or mobile app from [phantom.app](https://phantom.app).
* Create a new wallet and securely store your 12-word seed phrase offline. This is your key to accessing your wallet. **NEVER** share you seed phrase(s) with **anyone**.

# 2. Fund Your Wallet

* Open Phantom Wallet and click Buy.
* Pick Solana, input your desired amount, and Phantom will load quotes from payment providers.
* Choose a payment provider (e.g., MoonPay, Transak, and many others depending on your region).
* Follow the instructions to purchase SOL using your credit/debit card or other supported payment methods. Once complete, the SOL will appear in your wallet.



[Phantom buy within app](https://reddit.com/link/1i5odjq/video/wanylhn4x4ee1/player)



# 3. Access Jupiter Exchange

* Visit [Jupiter](https://jup.ag), a decentralized exchange aggregator for the Solana network.
* Connect your Phantom Wallet by clicking the **Connect Wallet** button.



# 4. Swap for $HEGE

* In the token selection menu, set SOL as the input token and search for $HEGE as the output token. Use the official contract address for $HEGE to ensure you do not purchase a copycat token. $HEGE has a verified badge (see image below)
* $HEGE contract address: ULwSJmmpxmnRfpu6BjnK6rprKXqD5jXUmPpS1FxHXFy 
* This can be found and confirmed on HegeCoin's official socials.
* Enter the amount of SOL you want to swap for $HEGE. Jupiter will calculate the equivalent amount of $HEGE and show the best rate.
* Confirm the transaction in your Phantom Wallet, ensuring that the details match before approving.

# 5. Verify the $HEGE Tokens in Your Wallet

* After the swap, $HEGE should appear in your Phantom Wallet. If it doesn't, manually add it by using the contract address.



# Crypto Safety Tips

1. **Secure Your Wallet**: Never share your seed phrase or private keys. Store them offline and in multiple secure locations.
2. **Double-Check URLs**: Only interact with official websites like Phantom and Jupiter to avoid phishing scams.
3. **Enable 2FA**: For any exchange or related service, use two-factor authentication for added security.
4. **Start Small**: When transferring funds for the first time, send a small test transaction to ensure everything works correctly.
5. **Stay Informed**: Join the $HEGE community for updates and support, and always verify information from official sources.



By following these steps, you’ll be set up to enjoy the benefits of $HEGE securely and confidently!

Jupiter company am stealed my monies help me tell Presidong elect,jupiterexchange,1i5n20z,2025-01-20 05:11:56,7,0.82,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jupiterexchange/comments/1i5n20z/jupiter_company_am_stealed_my_monies_help_me_tell/,fairysquirt,Memes,"That is incorrect, Jupiter earns nothing on fees, failed tx or otherwise.

There are many moving parts in DeFi, you aren't trading fake order books in a CEX off chain database. There are many market makers (AMMs) and hundreds of liquidity pools on each, where anyone can provide liquidity decentrally, which is all real tokens on the real blockchain, at real prices and market depth.

Unlike other swaps on Solana like Raydium or Orca when you swap there its only to LPs on that Dex, where as Jupiter routes your request to over 43 AMMs and gives you the best priced tokens out of every LP even for one swap... and CORE POINT, it does this for you for FREE, no swap fees. 

The fees you're paying are to Validators and the Liquidity Providers, Jup is an agregator and has no Liquidity besides JLP for perps.

Bots DDoS Solana RPCs several times some months back as Solana charged no cost for a failed tx, so now the network charges to deter bots.

What you are experiencing has nothing to do with Jupiter or even your wallet (sometimes Phantom services have broken in the past). 

Jupiter in a Solana first just rewrote their code base to have lower compute to land even more transactions every slot. 

Your wallet holds your authority keys. The dapp you connect it to provides the instruction based on your input, the blockchain provides the requirements. Success is determined by many factors. 

Slippage is you tolerance for price change in between the quote you were given (based on available liquidity when simulating) and what the reality is when your tx actually lands on chain.

Price Impact is how much your volume will impact the price per the LPs it takes from and their unique curve or tick spacing and order sizes at each price point. 

Slippage then is how much others can impact price before your order executes compared to your quote.

If you have 10% price impact, someone would need more than 10% slippage for their order to go through if your trade lands after their quote but before their swap lands.

The mempool is public so bots can see your slippage end exploit is in sandwhich mev attacks. You can avoid this by using Jito only (private mem bundles) which requires an additional fee paid to Jito validators ie a Jito tip. 

In Jupiter you can select 'Jito only' which I recommend if using slippage higher than 3% for example. Jito Validator isn't allocated every slot time (block), so your tx might not get in the fastest block. 

Priority fee chains all have this front running issue. 

Avoid high priority fees as tx can fail anyway. 

Good luck and keep learning how DeFi and blockchains actually function. Atleast you're not exposed to Cex market manipulating by moving fake numbers around on their off chain order book.

Is free “money” if i sell it.
Jupiter couldn’t give nothing and i would use the dex the sameway. So i’m grateful.

But let me say my truth, if you are giving,airdrop’in jup i deserved much more. 
I recived 1000 JUP but a trade everyday, literaly everyday, i put manualy more than 50 trades a day, sometimes, and regulary 100 trades a day, everyday since February last year. Used jup app has soon as comeout, i voted…

I’m just sharing what i fell… i see people on twitter reciveng 10,000 thousend jup and more, maybe they trade more than me, maybe, but a guy who put 50-100 trades a day, for almost a year, everyday recive 1000jup… is unfair… maybe everyone think they deserve more, maybe a lot a people use more your product, i’m just a man but oh man looks unfair for the time i’ve spend in jupiter,for the volume, a for the consistency."
Changing staking wallet,jupiterexchange,1i55w6r,2025-01-19 13:56:29,3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jupiterexchange/comments/1i55w6r/changing_staking_wallet/,bryon575,Resolved,"i really like the jupiverse and am trying to put all the crypto investments I have through it For the purpose of maximizing asr and jupuary and other rewards. For example jupsol instead of sol; investing in Jupiter funded startups that I believe in like cloud and Zeus, and in investing in jlp.

 I started staking jup and voting for all proposals about a year ago When  I found out about voting. Then recently in a different wallet I started adding a lot of Jupiter products to liquidity pools.

So because the staked jup i have is in a separate wallet then all the liquidity pool jup products I want to change the wallet of the staked jup to the other wallet with the liquidty products. 

is there a way to do this without unstaking jup and restaking in other wallet?

but I’m thinking for asr and jupuary rewards does it matter if it’s in the same wallet? It seems like it does because for example For latest jupuary data if they see each wallet separately for swaps for example and separately each wallet had a score of say 250k points then each wallet would get 1000 jup but if both wallets were combined then the one wallet would have 500k points and get 2500 jup. an extra 500 jup. Am I right about this?

but then I’m thinking. A lot of people must have multiple wallets that they operate with in the jupiverse so maybe it shouldn’t matter to combine them for asr and jupiverse rewards purposes.

  
anyone have any idea about this?"

This time its an “all in-one” feature that combines all our efforts of the past months. Let me introduce you the **“Jupiter Governance Profile”**.

[https://catalytics.pro/jupiter/governance](https://catalytics.pro/jupiter/governance)

This feature contains 2 sections. The general statistics and the personal statistics.

**General statistics:**  
On the top of the page you can see how addresses staking $JUP are distributed and how their percentiles are.

https://preview.redd.it/4ozg0oz1fkde1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c062f815e824b1121a19e13e7287c2b53f4dbab5

Under this tables you are able to find the total staked $JUP in a history chart since inception

https://preview.redd.it/cx1mbk94fkde1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dc1b8b133413fb247013a0395f1edfdb20cbae

  
**Personal statistics:**  
At the top of the page you are able to type in your public address (a valid Solana address)  
If this address has interacted with the jupiter governance program at least once, then you will get a complete analysis of your profile.

*First tab (Voting profile):*  
Here you can find all your voting activity and your ASR rewards of the past and the actual ASR period including rewards in USD value.

https://preview.redd.it/eety7587fkde1.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&s=e26e33e579d3159c62a6fefc546d5813fd867367

  
*Second tab (Ranks):*  
Here you are able to see how your address (profile) ranks compared to other addresses in the space. Additional to that you can see in what percentile of the space you belong.  
The blue eyes are toggles that allow you to hide specific fields in case you want to share your profile on your social media. The icons you see in the example are mapped to the distribution and percentiles tables of the beggining.

*Third tab (Address History):*  
Last but not least we have the address history tab. This tab represents the history of your address in the jupiter governance program. Your entire activity. From staking, to voting, to unstaking and much more. These actions are not defined by us but are part of the official governance program.  
We are not here to invent things but want to make them as transparent and easy to access as possible. If you execute an action you should be able to see this action in your profile in less than 5 seconds. Since we are using the Helius webhooks for this, we rely on the solana network.

We hope you enjoy this features and we are already working on new   
If you find any inconsistencies or some data are off, please do not hesitate to contact us, we are not perfect and its not easy to handle blockchain data.

Meanwhile we also have a fresh: [Catalytics X-Account](https://x.com/catalyticspro)

Where stars of tokens drift and fly,
A beacon glows, both near and far—
Jupiter rises, the guiding star.

Paths once tangled, now crystal clear,
Swaps and trades draw ever near.
No walls, no gates, just open space,
A home for all in crypto's race.

Liquidity flows like rivers wide,
Bringing value from every side.
Best rates, smooth sails, no fear of loss,
Jup charts the course, no matter the cost.

Builders dream and traders roam,
Yet every wanderer finds this home.
Not just a place, but something more—
A world where DeFi starts to soar.

So let the markets twist and turn,
And let new lessons light and burn.
In every swap, in every roam,
We whisper softly, Jup is Home.

Have you been an active participant in the Jupiter community, or even casually interacted with the platform? If yes, Jupiter has something special for you: a **Good Cats Contributor Form**! This is your chance to highlight your involvement and let Jupiter know how much you’ve contributed to its growth.

# Tips for Filling Out the Form

1. **Be Honest and Thorough**: Mention everything you’ve done to support Jupiter, big or small.

3. **Include Media Presence**: If you run a Telegram channel, YouTube account, or Twitter profile where you’ve mentioned Jupiter, don’t forget to highlight this! Even casual posts count, as long as they’ve added value to the community.
4. **Collaborative Efforts**: If you’ve worked with the team or helped with innovative integrations, ensure to describe those as well.

# Why It’s Worth Your Time

Jupiter has always appreciated its community, and this form seems to be their way of giving back. Whether it’s through recognition, rewards, or both, this could be an excellent opportunity for anyone who’s helped the platform grow.

Whether it's career, relationship or finance, I'm not able to succeed in any of them. 

**Career**: Getting rejected from the last round of the interviews even after having a strong CV(said by seniors). I've acquired most of the skills required for job in my field and still somehow I'm not able to please the interviewers with my skills. Not to be compared but few people around me who haven't worked enough and just were chilling their whole college life, got placed.

**Relationship**: Lost the girl I loved(it was going all good at one moment and the next day everything was over), in the beginning of 2025 lost my friend circle who were with me for past 5-6 years(this started last year itself). Quarrels on very small topics and no more feeling spark I used to feel with them. 

**What I expect from this posting:**

I just need to know whether it is due to some issue in my kundali/dasha or it's just me who's the issue. If it's related to my kundali, then tell me how can overcome these very uncertain failures.

ps: I've seen posts with F in heading gets more attention than with M(gender bias), hence not mentioning anything:)"

Now I can't connect, it says ""Your address has been flagged as high-risk"", how did that happen?

I use this wallet mainly as fiat on-ramp destination, and some spot trading in multiple blockchains, it's a Trust Wallet.

I use a VPN.

They offer to go to the discord server to get tech support I guess. I'll try that if this continues.

In the meantime, I'm curious if anyone had this happen to them. What could be the reason for that? How long does it persist?

I tried the governance tab (https://vote.jup.ag/) and it's connecting just fine.

This is a bit discouraging, as I don't understand what they mean by my address being ""high-risk"". I don't trade a lot (5 swaps on jupiter in the last month).

I need to find out the reason for this to understand if I can rely on jupiter app going forward.

Did you know LSTs make staked $SOL accessible for other DeFi activities? No more choosing between staking, holding, or lending!

🎯 Traditionally, you'd have to pick one:
Stake $SOL for yields
Hold $SOL for price appreciation
Lend $SOL for interest

But with LSTs, you can do it all.

🎯 Shoutout to the team behind LSTs for pioneering this innovation!

🎯 Now, let's talk JUPSOL:

 It's an LST that represents staked $SOL tokens with Jupiter's Validator, earning yields and MEV kickbacks.

🎯 What sets JUPSOL apart?

0% management fee
0% validator commission
0% stake deposit fee
0.1% $SOL deposit fee
0% withdrawal fee

🎯 Benefits of JUPSOL?
Earn native staking yields
Participate in DeFi activities
Improve transaction rates on Jupiter products

🎯 Security is top-notch!

 JUPSOL is powered by the SPL stake pool program. Audited and secured by a multisig with multiple signers.

🎯 In summary, JUPSOL achieves the goal of an LST and more! Making DeFi accessible, flexible, and rewarding.

🎯 Ready to experience JUPSOL? 

Head to Jup.ag to swap your $SOL and start enjoying the benefits

🎯 Got questions about JUPSOL or LSTs? Ask away!

🎯 Want to learn more about Jupiter's ecosystem? Explore their docs and community!
