"Market trends indicate DEXs have replaced VC markets for token price discovery, while CEXs continue to serve as exit liquidity",Blockmandev,1i0qvq7,2025-01-13 17:41:10,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i0qvq7/market_trends_indicate_dexs_have_replaced_vc/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Binance’s latest token listings are hitting speed bumps, underperforming compared to the broader crypto market. Analysts suggest price discovery is now thriving on decentralized exchanges while centralized platforms are being used as exit liquidity. 

Take Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) and ChainGPT ($CGPT) for example—they’ve managed to stay somewhat afloat amidst the storm. As of now, $PENGU trades at $0.028, a 60% drop from its debut at $0.07, while $CGPT is down just 4.7% since its January listing. On the other hand, memecoins like Simon’s Cat ($CAT) and Magic Eden’s ($ME) token have taken a nosedive, losing approximately 70% of their value.

Market expert Ignas sees this as a healthy pivot. Previously, price discovery happened in private VC markets, with centralized exchanges acting as exit liquidity. The trend has shifted—decentralized exchanges are taking over as hubs for price discovery.

The story doesn’t end there. The Velodrome ($VELO) token also illustrates this dynamic, dropping nearly 70% after its Binance listing. It now sits at $0.1154. Traders—particularly those dubbed as “smart money”—are driving this shift by leaning toward decentralized platforms.

Interestingly, on-chain activity is heating up. December saw decentralized exchanges achieve a record-breaking $434.4 billion in spot trading volume. On-chain derivatives markets also marked a new peak with nearly $341 billion in traded volume. As of January, decentralized platforms have handled 16% of the total spot trading volume, with weeks still left to monitor.

Eyes are on decentralized exchanges as they outpace old-school VC markets for price discovery, while centralized players hold their ground as liquid exit ramps.

Let’s Dive into the Ethereum Ecosystem: Explore the Future of Decentralized Innovation!,ethtrader,1hj4szx,2024-12-21 02:23:36,6,0.75,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hj4szx/lets_dive_into_the_ethereum_ecosystem_explore_the/,kirtash93,Technicals,"Hello everyone! Today I bring to you an analysis of Ethereum Ecosystem site [https://www.ethereum-ecosystem.com/](https://www.ethereum-ecosystem.com/)

As I have mentioned before in other posts I consider this kind of sites the most important to make each blockchain ecosystem visible and most ""safe"" because if prevents you from having to search it by yourself on the browser and have to avoid phishing sites. Thanks Google.

Unfortunately in Ethereum case (maybe I just didn't click the right places) but I didn't found and official ETH site with it which I believe they should have one. Throwing this idea to your roof u/vbuterin, have an official page/site with the whole ETH ecosystem apps links like the one I am analyzing.

Lets dive in!

# Ethereum Ecosystem

This site main page is clean and shows some of the most important apps in Spotlight showing the chains they are available on, their social networks and a direct link to a bigger description.

[Main Page](https://preview.redd.it/61nbd8v2j58e1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d63e055b90646352fa6db6ca1fcbb04f29ac4e)

# Uniswap site

If you click on Uniswap it leads you to a page that deeper explains what Uniswap is, related apps and even reviews (which we know can be manipulated but sometimes they can be useful).

[Uniswap page](https://preview.redd.it/k5ogynrpj58e1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=464000ae4ac17b214bdb6b3f267cbb3a305fc25a)

# Filtering

One of the thing I liked most is that you can also filter between categories and blockchains making it a lot more easier to find what you are looking for.

[Filtering](https://preview.redd.it/uk7favx0k58e1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=0feb22b1094e97514aa3587638242fb79fbf4cce)

# Faucets

It also have a faucets section for those who need some coins to move. If I am not wrong understanding it you require to do something to be able to get some of those coins.

>1. Enter Your Ethereum Address

>Visit the PoW faucet of your choice and input your testnet wallet address where you wish to receive the ETH. Solve an hCaptcha to prove you are not a bot.

>2. Perform Computational Work

>Engage in a simple mining process by using your computer's processing power to solve a cryptographic challenge provided by the faucet.

>3. Claim Your Tokens

>Once you have accrued sufficient rewards, claim your ETH. The tokens will then be sent to your specified wallet address, ready for use in testing and development.

[Faucets](https://preview.redd.it/pt0ub2ack58e1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3c51b9b97ee6c6d5f6b9aec515ebd824d67d13)

# Wallet connection

The site also allows you to ""have an account"" connecting your wallet to the site so you can add your own reviews, fav apps list, etc. I tried it with a fresh hot wallet and I didn't notice any weird type of contract sign so looks safe to do it. However, my advice is to never connect your wallets with coins to this kind of sites, ONLY those wallet you use to play with crypto that should be not even your hot wallet where you hold some coins.

[Wallet connection](https://preview.redd.it/52ptyfcqk58e1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=e06b7df834e5be890cf461417a6a423918045adf)

# Opinion

I think this kind of apps should be mandatory and that each blockchain official site should have a place with something similar to this because it increase security, legitimacy of each project, etc.

"What happens when the emissions/development stops for ve(3,3) projects?",defi,1hexddl,2024-12-15 12:21:46,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1hexddl/what_happens_when_the_emissionsdevelopment_stops/,AvgBoyd,:discuss: Discussion,"Hey there. I tried posting this in a few places like r/cc and the appropriate ve(3,3) subs but it got removed from r/cc for not having enough karma, and had close to zero traction on responses in the other subs. I figured I'd try my luck asking here anyway. A few months ago after $AERO went from $0.90-ish to above a dollar I stumbled across another project offering a similar ve(3,3) model (Aerodrome Finance being forked from Velodrome Finance, which the project at hand is also forked from) on the chain it sits on and have done some LP-ing to get some emissions.

The LP earnings have been and are still fine for the most part given the current state of the chain having a constant inflated state of network activity, but I've recently come to know from one of the community members that the developer behind the project has been basically missing in action for a while now due to health issues. I've asked and got back a few responses from the community but have grown increasingly speculative that something might have halted the progress of the project altogether.

I'm nearing the conclusion that the lead developer of the project might no longer be with us (figuratively), but putting the whole farfetchedness aside I'd like to ask for anyone or everyone's opinions on a few questions I have about ve(3,3) projects in general since the responses in the sub/server have mostly been from the same one or two community members who more or less are in the same info-draught:

1. What should one expect from a project that's basically in the early stages of what Aerodrome (and Velodrome for that matter) was if its progress halts or stops completely in the absence of the developer, and therefore its continued development?
2. Assuming the chain's TVL increases and more funds get deposited into the project's pools, could the ve(3,3) model still function autonomously and fuel the flywheel effect as intended?
3. In terms of sustainability would the tokenomics model inherently allow the project to function normally as an exchange even without updates, assuming there are no security flaws and that the smart contracts are functioning properly?

At least to my understanding, the tokenomics in and of itself imply that vote-escrowed token holders basically provide governance on which pools get the rewards per epoch, this assuming the chain it's drawing liquidity from doesn't fail in the long run.

What happens if the emissions stop entirely? Especially if the developer behind the project theoretically isn't replaced, would the exchange/project work as long as the chain's TVL rises and more users/arb-bots use the exchange as a means to tap into the ve(3,3) model? I'd really like to hear everyone's thoughts or opinions on what might happen to the project and its token(s) in the future (assuming the project isn't forked) and if anyone has any experience dealing in any project that had a similar event described above and if any of such projects are still running to this day.   
  
Sorry if it's a lot to digest but I've tried asking around elsewhere and it's been challenging getting anything informative so I'm hoping I'd be able to get some questions answered and if possible, some perspectives/opinions here.  
  
Thanks in advance."
Velodrome Finance LPs,defi,1hekqc2,2024-12-14 23:18:39,0,0.38,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1hekqc2/velodrome_finance_lps/,SOL_ETH_BTC_XLM_XRP,:question: Help,"I recommend checking out the Velodrome Finance DEX (OP network). Check out the liquidity pools. Some offer 9,000-17,000% on pairs. Please try them out. I need a crash test dummy. PLEASE. I got interested because I saw a YouTube ad advertising Automated Market Maker liquidity pools. Then I saw on Coinbase that VELO was up 95% for the day 1-2 days ago. On the VELO whitepaper it states that the DEX has new AMM LPs. Your rewards for providing to a LP on Velodrome Finance are in VELO, which the creators of VELO can mint infinitely. You can sell the VELO right after you get the rewards if you don’t believe in the tokenomics of VELO or that it is too high price wise rn. The LP I saw with the highest APR was CL-200 USDC/VELO on the third page of LPs which was at 17,000% APR at one point in the day, then 11,000% at the low point of the day. This pool is able to provide such high APR since the TVL is only about $500,000. 
I invite all you from this DeFi Reddit space to test out the LPs on the Velodrome Finance dapp/DEX with a small amount of money. But please DM me your result and I can calculate your actual APY yield since the stated APR isn’t what you actually get. If you provide more liquidity you get a higher APR. I also want to see if anyone can figure out through research what the 200 of CL-200 means. I know CL means concentrated liquidity. I couldn’t through research."

Leading the charge today are Velodrome Finance ($VELO), Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), and Aerodrome Finance ($AERO) — and the buzz is real. 

$VELO skyrocketed a massive 125% after Binance announced its spot market listing. Trading at just $0.15 before the news broke, it’s now hovering around $0.33. With buying pressure building, analysts suggest $VELO could rally toward $0.44 — unless profit-taking holders flip the script.

$FARTCOIN also fired up the charts with a 25% surge, pushing its market cap to $655 million. The Solana-based meme coin is looking unstoppable, with strong support at $0.20 and a potential run to $1 in sight. But let’s be real, meme coins are forever a wildcard, so buckle up.

Meanwhile, $AERO — Velodrome’s sister token on Coinbase’s Base chain — finds itself in the mix. While its price dipped 2.5% today, rising Money Flow Index readings paint a bullish picture. If the bulls hold steady, $AERO could aim for $3, but any slowdown might sink it closer to $1.79.

Altcoin season heating up? Let’s watch how this unfolds.

Velodrome Finance: Velodrome is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub on the Optimism blockchain, focusing on efficient trading and liquidity incentives for the Optimism ecosystem. It uses an innovative ve(3,3) token model, combining governance with liquidity incentives, making it a core DeFi player on Optimism.

Aerodrome Finance: Aerodrome is a fork of Velodrome but operates on the Base blockchain (a layer-2 network built by Coinbase). While it retains Velodrome’s ve(3,3) mechanics, Aerodrome is tailored to support Base’s ecosystem, aiming to become the central liquidity hub for projects on Base.

Key Difference: Blockchain focus: Velodrome is Optimism-specific, while Aerodrome is designed for Base.

Ecosystem: Aerodrome leverages the same model but targets projects and liquidity needs unique to the Base blockchain.

Velodrome and Aerodrome Finance are developed by the same team, with Aerodrome being a fork of Velodrome. If you believe in Aerodrome’s potential, it’s worth considering Velodrome as both projects share strong fundamentals and similar growth opportunities in their respective ecosystems.

But Aerodrome has the advantage of tapping into Coinbase’s Base network, which attract obviously strong growth in the future.

Velodrome Finance (VELO) could be a good investment for high-reward seekers due to its low market cap (~$120 m at the time of writing the text) and its critical role as the leading DEX on the rapidly growing Optimism Layer-2 ecosystem, offering strong upside potential this bullish market.

I post this for newcomers to make sure everyone knows the connection and main differences to Aerodrome Finance. "

Can't see locked Velo in Velodrome...,AerodromeFinance,1gwgol1,2024-11-21 08:48:30,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1gwgol1/cant_see_locked_velo_in_velodrome/,thematthewtaylor,,"Hello,

Debank shows I have some Velo locked in a veNFT. I can't seem to find it in Velodrome. How do I interact with it?

Just looked on block explorer, it was locked 637 days ago.

Is this a v1 lock or something?"
I'm worried this female character is written incredibly sexist,writingcritiques,1gsteol,2024-11-16 13:20:55,3,0.8,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1gsteol/im_worried_this_female_character_is_written/,dimestorepublishing,Humor,"(So the plot is about Johnny, our MC, finding himself invited into the inner circle (The society) of a big time hollywood director's son whose known for debauched parties. He is trying to strike up a relationship with a female member of the Society, Lyla, who when he joined gave him cryptic warnings about how he doesn't know what he's getting into)

Johnny was surprised that Lyla wanted to meet at a coffee Jamboree, with all the money this woman was probably making through her various business interests he assumed that she probably knew all sorts of secret, password-only places where, even if she was just going out for a coffee, she could get some of that rare 30$ a cup coffee that only high society knew about.

“You’re probably wondering why we’re in Coffee Jamboree,” Lyla said. She was wearing a green halter top and black yoga pants. She had a high-end Petit-Velo purse and pure white kicks on her feet. She had her hair combed over and hanging off her left shoulder and god damn she looked so good, Instagram good.

“Little bit, not going to lie,” Johnny said, “I thought being in the…Society…would get me access to higher-end places,” he smiled.

“Oh, don’t worry, you’ll get those too, but I like to come to Jamboree every once in a while,” she said, walking up to place her order. “I would like a triple mocha iced frap, whip cream, sprinkles and caramel drizzle, and chocolate drizzle, extra large, and I would also like a small vanilla Latte with Skim milk,” she said, ordering two drinks. That was a little curious, why would she order two drinks, judging by how intense that first drink was, that would probably be enough for anyone.

Johnny went up and made his usual order, “Medium black,” he said. This had to be the most confusing set of three drinks this barista had ever made.

“So how are you liking it so far?” she asked, asking Johnny about his feelings towards the Society.

“I think this is a great opportunity, but that said, I can see needing an exit plan, I feel like things could get a little hairy if I’m not careful,” he said.

“They can, and they will, when Penny OD’d, I thought it was all over, I really did,” she said as they waited for their drinks.

“Whose Penny?” Johnny asked.

Lyla sighed, “Penny, cutest little girl, she was only 17, Zoe thought Zak was being a bit brash, bringing in an underage girl, but he swore he was going to keep her safe. He was helping her career, getting her jobs, saw potential in her. She was in the first season of Donner and Thalia, have you seen that?” she asked.

“No, I mean, that name sounds familiar,” Johnny said, “Sounds like maybe something I saw a commercial or billboard for,” he said.

“Oh it was totally scandolus, see, she got a job as a female lead on a really ambitious project on a kids network, the industry touted it as ‘Price of Kings’ for kids, she’s riding high, at the peak of her career, set and ready to have an amazing life as the new teen IT girl, and Zak didn’t keep the leash tight enough. We warned him that if he was going to take such a tender girl under his wing he should keep an eye on her, that he owed that to her, but he didn’t, and he brings this little girl into a world thats fine with little girls doing what little girls are want to do,” she said, “Fucking idiots, no business sense, makes me ashamed of my gender,” she said, “Zak got her the treatment she needed, but as per-usual, she had proven herself a liability to the Society, Zak will turn his eyes once, and he’ll bail you out once, but after that, you’re a liability, and then,” she tossed her thumb to the side, “That’s the biggest thing you need to look out for, if you fuck up, maybe you’ll get one pardon, if it’s not too bad, if it’s not fuck a fourteen year old bad, he might help you out, but if you find yourself in more than two misunderstandings, he wont want anything to do with you, and you’re back on the street,” she said. 

The names “J-honey and Lylac” were called out. Johnny took his medium black, and Lyla took her crazy insane order in one hand and her modest vanilla latte in the other as they found a booth at the back.

“Umm, elephant in the room, two drinks?” Johnny raised an eyebrow as Lyla was getting her phone out.

“Hold on, I got to clock in,” Lyla said as she opened her camera and held her phone up, putting on the fake affectations of a smile and bubbly disposition “Hey everyone, just at Jamboree my total forever fave place to go, and I’m treating myself, I mean, what’s the point of life if you don’t treat yourself a bit? And I got to admit, I was a little naughty today, and I aske for whole milk, because who cares, it feels good,” she smiled as she took a drink from the straw of the insane drink, making sure to get it in full view of the camera. “I love their whip,” she said as she took her finger and scooped up a bit of the whip-cream topping and seductively licked it off her finger, sprinkles and dressing and all, “Kisses everyone,” She took the video, posted it, and then closed her phone.

Her tone of face instantly changed to disgust, “Poison,” she said, as she found a nearby waste-bin and slammed the Nine-dollar drink right in the trash. She took a sip from her vanilla latte with skim milk, almost like she was washing her mouth out with it.

Johnny was very curious, “Got to ask, what the hell was that about?”

“Yeah, it’s good for clicks, people like seeing women like me indulge, more importantly other women like seeing women like me, women like they want to be, indulge,” Lyla said. “See, any stupid bimbo can get a hundred thousand guys following her on Instagram, it’s criminally easy to do that, but theres no money to be made there, the influencer economy is built entirely on the female audience. What would be the point of being an influencer shucking purses and make up if the only audience you see are men who don’t have the two braincells necessary to buy those products for their girlfriends, if they even have girlfriends, I’m successful because I know how this business works. I have cultivated an audience of young women who think…well, they think they can be me,” she said, smiling. “They can’t, but they don’t need to know that, they like treating themselves to some insane fifteen hundred calorie drink once a week, and if they see me do it once every two months, it makes it okay for them, that’s why my statistics show over sixty percent of my followers are female, they love living vicariously through me, I’m their para-social bestie, they want to be me, so they buy the purses I hawk, they buy the make up I hawk, it’s turned out to be very profitable,” she said.

Johnny found himself thinking of his MeTube scam, “I think I get it,” he said.

“So yeah, just business, good business to be in, better than stocking shelves at Wal-mart at least,” she said.

Johnny usually tried to play it cool when around women, but he just blurted out, “You are insanely interesting,”

“Wait till you see me at a party, a real Society party, not that little get together you were first invited too, one where it’s just us and the entertainment,” she grinned.

“Entertainment?” Johnny raised an eyebrow.

“Yeah, that’s the thing about the Zak, he loves prostitutes, like LOVES prostitutes, can’t get enough, and he’s so fucked in the head, he even invites a couple guys for us girls, I’ve never induldged, but I’m pretty sure Chastity has at least been double teamed, and that was while she was dating Tommy, so I don’t know what she’s going to get up to now,” Lyla took another drink of her coffee. Johnny took a sip of his.

“So you keep telling me how dangerous it is to be here, but you’re doing it,” Johnny said, “That’s kind of a mixed message, how did you even get involved in this?” he asked.

“I was an extra, still building my following, trying to pay my dues in the industry, was a great angle, everyone loves an underdog, bucky little girl from Montana trying to chase her dreams in the big city, I had about eighty thousand followers by then, and Zak was one of them,” she said. “Somehow, some way, he heard about me, I got a part in one of his projects, small part, but a part,” she said, “It was in Spiderman’s Divorce, I had one scene in it, I was Gwen Stacy,” she said, “Crazy shoot day, my only claim to fame was falling off a bridge and getting my neck snapped, had to go to a fucking chiropractor after it, but he saw I had a following, so he made sure to get a couple selfies with me, had me retweet the project, probably earned him another hundred thousand views all said and done,” She leaned in laying her head on her hand, “He’s got a great entrance plan, but when he’s done with you, he puts two slugs in the back of your head and leaves you behind the barn,” she said, “You’ve seen it first had, look at Tommy,” she said.

“Tommy fucked a fourteen year old, that’s the kind of behavior that deserves two slugs,” Johnny said.

Lyla smiled, “Yeah, but do you remember how he mentioned Thailand?” she asked.

“Yeah, said he looked the other way,” Johnny said, “Fuck, what kind of shit does the Society get up to?”

“The most fucked up shit, that was a boy’s trip, when Zak tells you, now that you’re a part of the Society, that you’re going on a boy’s trip, get ready, because you’re about to see something totally fucked, Zoe wouldn’t talk to him for like three weeks after they came back from that shit, and Zoe fucking loves Zak,” she said.

“He said it himself, shes his ride or die girl,” Johnny said.

“She is, remember what I told you, shes playing the long game,” Lyla said, “Behind every fucked up guy who finds success, theres a fucked up girl who turns a blind eye,” she smiled. “She got in early, met him in highschool, glombed onto him, deals with his bullshit in this kind and loving way, lets him know that no matter how debauched he gets he’ll always have a mommy to come back to, really says a lot about his relationship with his own mom,” she said.

“Oh, sounds like you’ve got some dirt,” Johnny smiled, taking another drink of black.

“Oh yeah, I got like an entire deposition built up, it’s my insurance policy, if the things that Zak is want to get up too, when he’s with the boys, ever comes to light, I will be able to present the most insane testimony, enjoy a nice healthy dose of immunity for my cooperation, and get away scott free,” she said.

“I do like getting away scott free,” Johnny said, remembering his own several run ins with the law.

“So you need to be smart about this, are you one for temptation?” she asked.

“Depends on the temptation,” Johnny said, trying to snap into this cool persona thight might be able to impress this bombshell he was on a coffee date with.

“That’s a bad sign,” Lyla said.

“Hey, I’m not going to do anything too crazy, trust me, I’ve had my run ins with the law, it’s the worst fucking feeling in the world, I pride myself on my instinct to avoid that all costs,” Johnny said.

“We’ll see how long you last,” Lyla said, “See, us women, in the Society, we go in with a clock, I got like a year left at most, before I’m traded in for the new model, Chastity, if she’s smart she’ll get out the minute her series is officially renewed, but she wont because she’s not smart, so obsessed with her status, stupid bitch, she’s only 18, if she goes down the path, she’s got to worry about 5 years worth of scandals the Society is going to find  itself in, but for you, for one of the boys, you’re either in this for life, or you’re in this until you fuck up so bad, Zak can’t even look at you, and if Zak doesn’t want anything to do with you have fucked up so bad, no one is going to want anything to do with you, just know, if you want to be in the industry, and you lock yourself in with Zak, you’re locked in, this is the path you chose,” she said.

“I’m just a bean counter,” Johnny said, “I’m helping him out with financing his next project, shit goes bad, I play the accountant card,” Johnny said, “Just a boring accountant, no part of that madness,” he smiled.

“You know, my mom always said I should marry an accountant,” Lyla smiled back.

“Really?” Johnny asked, raising his eyebrows, was she sending him a signal.

“Or a doctor, or a lawyer, or any other profession that every mom in this country desperately hopes her daughter marries,” she said.

“Do you want to get dinner?” Johnny asked.

“I have a shoot for Petit Velo tonight,” Lyla said, “But maybe I could pencil you in later this week, how free are your weeks?” she asked.

“It’s summer vacation, I got about week left on my internship, then I’m all free, how’s next friday?” Johnny asked.

“Well, I guess I could, but no pictures, no iBook status, I can’t have a boyfriend, for reasons, it’s important to my Instagram career,” she said.

“I dropped iBook after that One-ID bullshit, you don’t got to worry about me,” Johnny said.

“One-ID, don’t even get me started on that, total corporate fascism,” she said.

“Thank god that got broken, thank you President Markway,” Johnny raised his medium black and Lyla clicked her small vanilla skim latte to it.

“Thank you president Markway,” Lyla smiled."

Take your profits as you fly to the moon boys! Some aerodrome info if curious below.,AerodromeFinance,1gpadm9,2024-11-11 21:29:15,17,0.91,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1gpadm9/take_your_profits_as_you_fly_to_the_moon_boys/,Paul_Futz,,"Just a reminder and I guess personal advice for some, again you should do your own research and risk assessment's. If you have any thoughts to add please comment below. I am not an expert just an enthusiast and I am sure there are smarter people on this reddit and in this space than me but if you have any questions I am happy to answer.

*  Right now we are at 1.50 building support at this key level 1.45-1.55.
* Market capitalization of Aerodrome Finance (AERO) is currently $995,495,475
* Market capitalization of Uniswap (UNI) is Currently $5,544,363,375
* AERO price with the market cap of UNI (5.58x) = $8.14 Per Aero
* Price increase of 37.50% in the last 7 days, Aerodrome Finance (AERO) is outperforming the global cryptocurrency market which is up 28.50%
* If we see a small pull back it might touch 1.40 support level (OK short term buy chance)
* Warning that assets can crash and be affected by global events like wars. We could still see a $1.00 or .80 aero before the final up of this bull market its still early.
* Slipstream/Aero is in my opinion has more future potential than Uniswap and will continue to catch up to it.
* Aero is very likely to cement its support at 1.50 and then start reaching for 1.80 I don't expect too much resistance at 1.60 next will be tough at $2 depending on chart data I might make a short term sell at 1.98 and buy back at 1.80 if we retest support. I expect some bouncing from 1.80-2$ before we breakthrough.
* This is why among other reasons people believe in a 10$ plus Aero. I am more conservative for now but its clearly a incredible Risk to potential ROI ratio we are dealing with here.
* Price discovery beyond that I personally have no predictions or opinions but personally here are my selling/ take profit points at this time.

1. 2.00 25% of Bag
2. 2.50 25% of Bag 50% Sold
3. 2.90 30% of bag 80% Sold
4. 3.25 10% of Bag 90% Sold
5. 4.00 5% of Bag 95% Sold
6. 4.85 5% of Bag 100% Sold

this is my current exit strategy that I will try and stick to its always hard when you see it shooting up.

I will personally always have some aero as some is locked 4 years max lock so won't be selling that this bullrun although you could as NFT.







Here's some additional aero info for ya.

# What is Aerodrome Finance?

Aerodrome Finance (AERO) is a next-generation Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed to serve as the central liquidity hub on the Base network. It combines a powerful liquidity incentive engine, vote-lock governance model, and user-friendly experience, inheriting features from Velodrome V2. Aerodrome employs a dual-token system, with AERO (ERC-20) for liquidity providers and veAERO (ERC-721) for governance participation.

# How is Aerodrome Finance used?

* **Token Swaps**: Aerodrome enables users to swap tokens with minimal slippage and low fees, making it a preferred choice for traders seeking efficiency and reliability.
* **Liquidity Incentives**: Liquidity providers deposit trading tokens and receive AERO emissions as rewards. These emissions incentivize liquidity providers to contribute to the platform's growth.
* **Governance**: AERO holders can lock their tokens to receive veAERO NFTs, which grant voting power to influence emission distributions and receive trading fees and other incentives. This vote-lock governance model promotes a decentralized approach to managing liquidity incentives.
* **Epoch-Based Rewards**: Emissions and rewards are distributed in epochs, with liquidity providers receiving emissions based on the votes their pools accumulate.

Overall, Aerodrome Finance is a robust platform that combines advanced automated market maker (AMM) features with a robust governance model to create a compelling environment for users and investors alike.

Hey, As the title says I'm 17 years old and have been trying to get rich for the last couple years now. I am after some advice or opinions on my progress so far and just thought l'd list everything l've got so far.
I have an investment portfolio invested in Value/ Growth stocks which is worth around £28,000, it's made up of 10 stocks which I believe are of really high quality and are:

Alibaba	
Kering	
Paycom Software	
Baidu	
Concentrix	
Wise	
NetEase	
Kaspi Kz	
Weibo	
Global Payments	

I have £10,500 in cryptocurrency which is invested into 6 altcoins:

Velodrome Finance 
Aerodrome Finance
Immutable
Celo
Optimism
Internet Computer Protocol

On top of this I have £4,000 aside to put into a house deposit account in which the government will match with £1,000. This will be invested into ETFs.

I also have a £2,500 savings account and an additional £1,000 in my bank.
All of my stocks, savings are in tax free accounts with the only taxable assets being my crypto.

I'm working a part time job alongside my studies which I use to add about £200 a month into my stock portfolio and plan on keeping this up into the future.

Let me know what you guys think and if you'd change anything about what i've done/got. I personally believe that I have my money in all the perfect places but am open to feedback,

Thanks!"

He traded altcoins like The Graph (GRT), Velodrome (VELO), and Aerodrome (AERO). Notably, Collins bought and sold AERO multiple times, showing significant acumen by buying low and selling high.

"Hey, just some questions about the project",KodoExchange,1fr5otu,2024-09-27 23:43:17,6,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/KodoExchange/comments/1fr5otu/hey_just_some_questions_about_the_project/,AvgBoyd,💬 Discussion 💬,"Hey, first user post!  
  
Just checked out the documentations and I noticed a few things that come to mind:  
  
1. Behind the team, I'm able to look up ""the Narator (Aave & Cian)"", ""Nirry"" and ""Jonathan Herrera (Capa.fi & LaDAO)"", but can't find much or anything about the rest. Are the devs and the rest doxxed at the moment or is this a work in progress?  
  
2. Is there an easier way to check the price of the token? I don't see one anywhere, and the closest thing I could find from a search online is one on coingecko that just says ""Kodo Exchange Statistics"". 

3. Is the coin listed elsewhere on other exchanges? The only place I can find trading the coin is on the website ""Kodo Exchange"" itself, and referencing point no.1 the price for swapping is slightly different across multiple pairs (understood that liquidity plays a role and it being loose does not help).

4. Reading the whitepaper leads me to understand that the project mainly caters to Taiko's L2, but looking around there I still see it's a work in progress over there as well. How will Kodo Exchange compare to other ve(3,3) projects out there like Velodrome and Aerodrome? 

5. Reading the whitepaper also leads me to realise that this project is a fork of Velodrome (love the price action) and I feel hopeful as from what I'm looking around, this looks like a work in progress and it's looking really early. Will Kodo Exchange eventually go down the same roadmap and path of development as Velodrome and eventually introduce stuff like Slipstream (their version of concentrated liquidity pools)? 

6. Realised that there's a twitter handle on the sub's sidebar. Not much information on how it plans on aligning itself with Taiko there (apart from the docs), would be nice if the mods or team members (if any) come out about it. If the project's legit I don't see why it'd be an issue to clarify as it only brings more eyes to the project.   
  
7. Question for anyone who stumbled across this sub after going down the rabbithole when VELO did a 30% overnight over the last few days; are we too early for this one? I'm looking at the quotes on Kodo Exchange's swap rates and 1 KODO goes for $0.0002 on some pairs, and $100 sets you back at roughly 500,000 tokens if you ignore slippage. If this is anything close to what Velodrome is doing then I wouldn't mind throwing a hundred or two given how VELO's performing today. "

1. How much do you generate by doing this?

3. Which risks are there to know of before doing this?"

VeloXion Token on Initial Stellar Offering (ISO) — Phase 2 : Smart Contract Selling Begins!,CoinBase,1ekkla8,2024-08-05 06:39:59,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1ekkla8/veloxion_token_on_initial_stellar_offering_iso/,CarpenterLower1120,,"We are excited to announce the launch of the next phase in our presale journey: **Initial Stellar Offering (ISO) Phase 2: Smart Contract Selling**. This crucial phase will be hosted on the Stellar Launchpad Zone, developed by No Limit Token (NLT), and will run for 30 days starting August 2, 2024.

# What is the Initial Stellar Offering (ISO) Phase 2?

**ISO Phase 2: Smart Contract Selling** represents a significant step forward for VeloXion as we continue to build momentum within the Stellar ecosystem after Presale session ended on July 31st. This phase will leverage the Stellar Launchpad Zone to enhance our token’s visibility and credibility.

# Key Details:

* **Platform**: Stellar Launchpad Zone, developed by No Limit Token (NLT)
* **Token Release**: 100,000 VeloXion tokens
* **Duration**: 30 days
* **Start Date**: August 2, 2024

The Stellar Launchpad Zone provides a robust platform for showcasing VeloXion, offering a significant opportunity for broader exposure and engagement within the Stellar community.

# What to Expect:

* **Smart Contract Selling**: We are utilizing advanced smart contract technology to facilitate a seamless and transparent selling process.
* **Enhanced Visibility**: The Stellar Launchpad Zone will help VeloXion gain valuable traction and recognition within the Stellar network.

# Why the ISO Matters:

1. **Increased Exposure**: The ISO phase is designed to maximize VeloXion’s visibility across the Stellar ecosystem. By participating in the Stellar Launchpad Zone, we tap into a vast network of Stellar holders, increasing our token’s reach and recognition within the community.
2. **Strategic Growth**: This phase is a key component of our strategic approach to elevate VeloXion. It ensures that as we move towards our final public launch, VeloXion is well-positioned with greater market awareness and support.
3. **Enhanced Credibility**: Being featured on the Stellar Launchpad Zone adds a layer of credibility and validation to VeloXion. It highlights our commitment to growth and innovation, attracting new investors and stakeholders.

# Why VeloXion Stands Out:

✅ **Strategic Partnership and Projects**: VeloXion is supported by key partnerships, including our collaboration with AURAX. This partnership enhances our capabilities with advanced AI technology for on-chain monitoring. Additionally, our projects focus on mobile banking solutions to drive global financial inclusion, aiming to provide adaptive and accessible financial services worldwide.

✅ **Established and Transparent**: We provide comprehensive information on our launchpad listing, including a detailed executive summary, whitepaper, and links to our official website, Telegram community, and X account. This transparency highlights our commitment and credibility compared to other projects.

✅ **Compare and Decide**: We invite you to explore VeloXion alongside other projects listed on the launchpad. Our established foundation, strategic vision, and transparent approach make us a compelling choice.

# How to Participate:

To participate in this exciting phase, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Stellar Launchpad Zone](https://stellarlaunch.zone/launchpad) and scroll for VeloXion Labs.
2. [Ensure that all information matches with https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/VeloXion-GBO3D7L6KWB2X4WDLGLGSDTZSOMEM2SG3QTRRNEZE4FQB6Z7CZ7LO3R3-2](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/VeloXion-GBO3D7L6KWB2X4WDLGLGSDTZSOMEM2SG3QTRRNEZE4FQB6Z7CZ7LO3R3-2) (issuer, website address, etc.).

Please be cautious of potential imitators or irresponsible parties attempting to create confusion. Verify all details carefully before making any transactions.

# Conclusion:

Thank you for your continued support as we advance VeloXion towards a successful launch. Together, we are shaping the future of decentralized finance!"

Upcoming cycling events in August 2024,londoncycling,1eex3ks,2024-07-29 07:27:35,36,0.97,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/londoncycling/comments/1eex3ks/upcoming_cycling_events_in_august_2024/,wwisd,,"The summer weather is finally here, so time to get out on your bikes. Here's your monthly selection of upcoming events - please let me know all the things I missed (links in the comments so the post doesn't disappear in the spam filter).

- **27 July - 11 August** - Olympics watching at Herne Hill velodrome. You might have noticed the Olympics are on. If you want to watch any of the cycling events (from MTB and triathlon to road, BMX and track) HHV will have everything on in their club room. And have a cafe and good wifi to fullfill all your work from the velodrome needs (expect it to be busy for the men's road race as local boys Fred Wright and Ethan Hayter will be racing that). 
- **1 August** - Kew Gardens summer cycle. Tour the gardens at Kew on two wheels, and enjoy some sundowners, live music and face painters. Discounted bike hire available if you don't have your own bike. 
- **3 August** - Lewisham cyclists cycle to Faversham Creek via Hoo. A 70 mile/112km train assisted ride, taking the Thameslink out to Swanley, and back from Faversham. Easy pace, but it is a harder full day out due to the distance, and will include a lunch and pub stop. 
- **3-10 August** - London-Amsterdam David Eales Memorial ride. A 6-7 day ride over to the Netherlands to raise money for the London Cycling Campaign. 
- **3 August** - Oh! To be in Kent Audax - 210km, starting in Peckham Rye and finishing in Dulwich village. Audaxes are self-supported rides. You'll get a stamp card (digital or physical, your choice) and a route and have to get round it yourself. There's often some food at the start and finish and maybe a food stop with some limited options along the way, but generally you'll have to look after yourself. They're also very welcoming events. 
- **4 August** Croydon and Wandle trail. A nice relaxed 17 mile / 27km ride on some trails (though suitable for road bikes) from Queens Gardens in Croydon to Richmond via the Wandle trail, organised by LCC's Croydon chapter. 
- **10 August** - Big Ride for Palestine. An annual event that's been organised since 2015, but aiming to be a bit bigger this year what with the bombing happening in Gaza since October last year. There will be several rides in several UK cities, including London. 
- **10 August** - Park and picnic ride. LCC chapters from Bexley, Southwark and Lewisham are organisign some rides to Ladywell fields for a shared picnic (and maybe some blackberry picking as it is the season). 
- **11 August** - Tour of the hills audax. Another audax, 'only' 115km but you'll take in all the hills in Surrey going in and out of Shere the whole day. Beautiful, if challenging, route. 
- **11 August** - Free bike fixing and mechanics teaching. There's several LCC chapters who organise these events, just highlight the one in Leaside in the links. They're organised quite reguarly and can help you fix small things and teach you about some minor repairs such as fixing a flat tyre or tuning your gears. 
- **17 August** - an easy ride, aimed at beginners and families - from Brook Green in Hammersmith to Chiswick House for a coffee stop and back. It's about 7 miles, aiming for a steady 5-7m/h pace. The ride is free, but if you want to make a small (£1 suggested) donation, you can bring it in cash. 
- **18 August** - Cobham sportive (aka no feed 50). A new 50 mile / 78km sportive featuring some fun hils such as Barhatch, Leith Hill and Whitedown. 
- **25 August** - A short child-friendly 5 mile nature ride through Leaside. There's a few adult and children's bikes avaialble to borrow for the ride! Organised by LCC's Hackney chapter. 
- **27 August** - Women's social evening at Rapha. In preparation for their women's 100 rides (on 8 September), Rapha are organising a social evening, including a tube replacement workshop. All free and sponsored by Rapha and Fettle. 

Further out, but things to put on your calendar / get tickets for: 

- **1 September** - Rowlands Ramble audax. Cycle almost all the way to Porthsmouth and back in a day. Organised by Kingston Wheelers who are great at audax routes. 
- **8 September** - Rapha women's 100. Annual event when Rapha (and lots of other clubs) organise a 100km ride for women. 
- **22 September** - Box Hill Super climb. Hills are a theme for September. Box Hill isn't the hardest one, but you can of course make it difficult by just riding it as often as you can this day. Bit spenny at £39 (+ you're expected to fundraise at least £250 for Sense), but you do get to race up on closed roads. 
- **28 September** - Urban Hill climb. A race, but the shortest and most British version of a bike race as it's just going up Swain's Lane as fast as you can. Or on as silly a bike as you can. Fun to ride and to watch. 
- **25-27 October** - The London 6Day is back, but in a shorter 3 day version as it's got new organisers. Expect some big name cyclists (including Mark Cavendish who is rumoured to come down to celebrate his retirement, possibly as a record breaking TdF stage winner) and lots of hard and fast racing. But also a lot of fun. 
- **6-7 December** - The final two rounds of the UCI track champions league. Lee Valley Velodrome has hosted the TCL finale the last few years, and it's been a banger every single time. Sprinters and endurance riders race a short programme of the same races you'll see in the Olympics. 

Also, since the Olympics are on, here are some places to try out different Olympic disciplines yourself if you get inspired from watching the pros: 

- Mountain bike: [Redbridge cycle centre](https://visionrcl.org.uk/event/mountain-bike-skills/) up in the North East was set up in the run up to the London Olympics in 2012 and offers some nice MTB courses. There's also a road bike track used for races and general skills sessions. With a nice steep hill.  
- BMX riding: [Peckham BMX club](https://www.peckhambmx.co.uk/) are the place to be. They've got novice sessions on Thursday afternoons and Saturday mornings. 
- Track riding: [Herne Hill velodrome](https://www.hernehillvelodrome.com/track/#tasters), the OG London Olympic velodrome. Taster sessions for adults every Saturday at 1:30pm throughout summer, and lots of taster sessions and holiday clubs for kids too. Track bike hire included in the taster session price. 
- Road cycling: [Lee Valley VeloPark](https://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/lee-valley/velopark/road-cycling) have a nice pothole and traffic free circuit where you can hone your skills, or book some 1:1 learn to ride sessions (and LVV also offers some opportunities for all other disciplines!)."

Why hodling AERO is a bad idea,AerodromeFinance,1dqtjw2,2024-06-28 16:34:13,15,0.64,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1dqtjw2/why_hodling_aero_is_a_bad_idea/,inshallah-war,,"I have been studying the Aerodrome for quite some time now and tried to wrap my head around value of the project in general, and of the AERO token in particular.

In a first part, I crunch the current numbers to examine from where and to where value flows in the Aerodrome as is right now. I include the Velodrome in the analysis due to their close relationship, and to broaden the data basis.

In a second part, I discuss how these numbers may play out in the future and what dynamics this should incite.

**Current state**

Basic numbers from Velodrome from the current epoch/week:  
Fees and incentives (=""compensation"") of 1 week: $183.285,00  
Emissions of 1 week: 8805551 VELO  
Voting power: 943832685 VELO  
Price: $0.10

These result in the following KPIs:  
Compensation per emitted VELO: $0.02  
Inflation (annualized): 62%  
Average compensation per veVELO (annualized): 11%  
Total value of veVELO: $89,758,488

Basic numbers from Aerodrome from the current epoch/week:  
Fees and incentives (=""compensation"") of 1 week: $1,313,869  
Emissions of 1 week: 11,188,631 AERO  
Voting power: 612,906,900 AERO  
Price: $0.72

These result in the following KPIs:  
Compensation per emitted AERO: $0.12  
Inflation (annualized): 156%  
Average compensation per veAERO (annualized): 17%  
Total value of veAERO: $440,189,735

In summary, veAERO holders attract liquidity providers by paying them 6$ worth of AERO for every 1$ worth of fees and incentives.

As a consequence, the AERO that they pay out correspond to an annualized inflation rate of 156%, while the compensation that they take in corresponds to an annualized yield of 17%. From the perspective of a veAERO holder, the yield is visible via the weekly voting rewards. Meanwhile, the inflation is somewhat hidden: it drives the market price down, but other forces also act on the price, obfuscating the influence of the inflation.

Thus, liquidity providers are gettng decent returns, and protocols get deep liquidity cheaply, while veAERO holders are currently losing. At the same time, all APR numbers (voting APR and liquidity APR) look good, while all problems (inflation and impermanent loss) are hidden.

Sometimes, the AERO emissions to liquidity providers is likened to equity compensation in public companies. While this comparison may have some merit, the main point that veAERO holders overpay holds: paying in 6$ worth of AERO for 1$ worth of fees could be compared to a startup paying an junior software $50,000 worth of stock per month, and arguing this would be cheaper than debt. Obviously, such a strategy sells out the company and only makes sense if you consider the stock overpriced yourself.

**Future prospect**

A number of arguments are introduced in favour of the Aerodrome in the long term.

For one, the argument goes that volume will grow, fees will grow, and thus the value of AERO will grow. This has some merrit (although the volume numbers already seem to flatline), and there are a number of problems with it.

The argument implies that the current market cap anticipates future value. In a hypothetical end game in the future, the value of emissions will be below the value of fees and incentives, and thus holding veAERO would be actually profitable (not just as a speculation). However, why would liquidity providers still fuel the system in that scenario?

Further, even if the growth of volume, fees etc. leads to an increase in market cap, the price of a single AERO may still decline due to the exorbitant inflation.

Lastly, the volume on DEX generally does not follow an exponential curve, but rather hype cycles. Thus, once the ""on-chain summer"" and meme season are over, volume could come down crashing, taking the AERO market cap with it.

In summary, I am very sceptical of the future prospect of AERO. Pure AERO holders are all the way down in the food chain, but even veAERO voters are in a very risky position."
Rivo Points Program: Enhancing Engagement and Rewards,u_Educational_Home_665,1dpl4ah,2024-06-27 03:03:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Educational_Home_665/comments/1dpl4ah/rivo_points_program_enhancing_engagement_and/,Educational_Home_665,,"[https://www.rivo.xyz/points](https://www.rivo.xyz/)

In today's digital age, loyalty and engagement are pivotal for businesses looking to foster lasting relationships with their customers. Rivo, a pioneer in innovative customer engagement solutions, has introduced the Rivo Points Program, designed to revolutionize how businesses interact with their clientele. This program not only aims to reward customer loyalty but also to enhance overall engagement through a seamless and rewarding experience.

 The Evolution of Customer Engagement



Traditional customer loyalty programs have often been transactional, offering points or rewards based solely on purchases. However, Rivo understands that modern consumers seek more than just discounts—they crave personalized experiences and meaningful interactions with brands. The Rivo Points Program addresses these needs by offering a multifaceted approach to engagement.



How Rivo Points Program Works



The Rivo Points Program is built on the foundation of simplicity and inclusivity. Customers earn points not only through purchases but also through various interactions such as:



- \*\*Social Media Engagement:\*\* Liking, sharing, and commenting on posts related to the brand.

- \*\*Referrals:\*\* Inviting friends and family to join the program.

- \*\*Feedback:\*\* Providing valuable feedback through surveys or reviews.

- \*\*Community Participation:\*\* Joining online forums or attending brand-sponsored events.



These activities are designed to create a dynamic relationship between the brand and its customers, fostering a sense of community and advocacy.



### Personalized Rewards and Benefits



One of the standout features of the Rivo Points Program is its personalized rewards system. Rather than offering generic discounts, Rivo tailors rewards based on individual customer preferences and behaviors. This ensures that each reward feels unique and valuable, thereby strengthening the emotional connection between the customer and the brand.



The Rivo Points Program is seamlessly integrated with Rivo's existing ecosystem, including its mobile app and online platform. This integration allows customers to track their points in real-time, receive personalized offers, and easily redeem rewards—all through a user-friendly interface. Moreover, Rivo continuously innovates by introducing new features and rewards to keep the program fresh and engaging.

I want to apply to 10 reaches, 10 targets, and 5 safeties. My stats are kind of in the middle - so would love to hear about what kind of schools you may have gotten into with similar stats. 

Stats:

Research Post: What does it do?,AerodromeFinance,1c8fs4n,2024-04-19 23:12:56,1,0.67,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1c8fs4n/research_post_what_does_it_do/,Cooperivan1337,,"Hello all! I am trying to do as much research as possible on this Crypto, but sometimes its a bit harder to understand, so I figured I would ask on here... since we are all in this together.  


It says "" Aerodrome Finance is a next-generation AMM designed to serve as Base's  central liquidity hub, combining a powerful liquidity incentive engine,  vote-lock governance model, and friendly user experience. Aerodrome  inherits the latest features from Velodrome V2. Aerodrome NFTs vote to  distribute token emissions and receive incentives and fees generated by  the protocol. ""

what does that mean? I have seen posts saying that this coin is basically endorsed by Coinbase, and that you will essentially have to go through this coin to do stuff on the Base Network... but I didnt have to do that when I bought? I just purchased Ethereum, and then sent to my Wallet as BASE Ethereum... and then just swapped. I did the same thing for ALB.

&#x200B;

I do apologize for my ignorance on this... but I was hoping to find someone that could explain it a bit better to me. Thank you so much for any information and help! I really do appreciate it, and hope it can help anyone else that comes across this post."

Look, previous data shows that as we approach the halving event prices always dump significantly and rise back higher and higher in the upcoming months. So stop crying on Reddit or boards and start taking advantage of the low prices, try to gather liquidity to accumulate more Velo.

Don’t get shaken out, there is a reason you bought Velodrome in the first place.

Good luck to all of us.

How much do you believe needs to be invested in a portfolio to profit 100 000?,CryptoMarkets,1c4s1oj,2024-04-15 13:29:38,1,0.52,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1c4s1oj/how_much_do_you_believe_needs_to_be_invested_in_a/,Electronic_Shirt4279,DISCUSSION,"I've been accumulating for a couple of months, and I'm hoping to profit 100k+ by 2025, what do you believe my portfolio should be worth before halving to reach this goal? It depends on the cryptos you choose, but I'm just asking, for someone with a strong alt collection, a ton of research, and some experience so I beleive made some good choices. Im already pretty profitable. Im just curious about what my portfolio should be worth in general terms. Assuming average market returns in a bull run.

This is just speculation. I have a family member who is currently suffering from dementia and I want to support her as much as I can. Im in my late teens so I won't be devasted If i lose some money, I'm not stressed about any bills or anything. I also have plenty in savings and other assets, Ive been pretty successful last couple years, so this is just my high-risk asset money. 

edit, since so many are asking, here's most of my portfolio: Kas, Aero, Btc, sol, ada, fet, rndr, sei, sui, ponke, mochi, lcx, hbar, stx, icp, cgold, velo, eth, near, ocean, etc. Kaspa and Aerodrome finance being my two biggest bags."
Can't send VELO back to Coinbase,CoinBase,1c3u9m2,2024-04-14 10:01:34,0,0.5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1c3u9m2/cant_send_velo_back_to_coinbase/,Fluffy-Math2930,,"So I just sent about $500 of $VELO to my Coinbase Wallet from my Coinbase account using Coinbase Pay. And as I'm not the smartest, I didn't realize I would need ETH to send it back. I just wanted to test the sending and that's it.  
  
But once it was sent over I didn't have ETH to send the VELO back. So I sent about $20 of ETH to my Coinbase wallet using Coinbase Pay and tried to send it. Now it still says that I need ETH to be able to send or swap my VELO. I think this has to do because my ETH is on Ethereum Network and my VELO is on OP Mainnet.  
  
I am completely new to OP mainnet/Optimism network and had never heard of it prior to this experience. I just really want to know how I can send my VELO back to my Coinbase account. Should I first swap it to ETH? And how do I get ETH on the OP network so I can swap or send my VELO?

I also made a post about this on r/VelodromeFinancee with screenshots of my wallet and trying to swap and send it.

It seems to be unredeemable and the recent [velo.finance](http://velo.finance) dapps don't integrate it. You can use BNB or SOL. They offer warp and xchain to migrate your Velo tokens to these other chains.

I'm seeing lots of noise from velo holders promoting trading the token on the stellar dex and would love to hear from anyone better informed if Velo on Stellar is purely for speculation.

I can see their activity on twitter and within other chains. However, I haven't heard about Stellar from them in a long time.

Ive advised others against participating in Velo on Stellar but I'm happy to be wrong if they are still using the chain."
