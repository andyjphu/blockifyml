This information comes from [data collated by Messari](https://x.com/MessariCrypto/status/1874842491108900922), a company renowned for providing crypto research, reports, and real-time data.

https://preview.redd.it/f8mnh3eqjqae1.jpg?width=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=050df554cd065ac7ea19589929f185b63a05f2df

According to their analysis which excludes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum beat out competition from notable projects like Cardano (ADA), Sui Network (SUI), Ripple (XRP), Zcash (ZEC), and Filecoin (FIL) to secure its position as the second most favorite crypto project in the country, just trailing behind Solana by a few states.

What makes this data particularly interesting is the context of Ethereum's performance in 2024. It was not a stellar year for ETH, which failed to capitalize on an ETF to surge significantly, only managing a 45% increase over the year. In contrast, Solana had a remarkable run, hitting an all-time high in November and boasting a 92.9% increase over the same period.

Need i mention that [Solana saw more activity than ETH in 2024](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-beats-ethereum-economy-first-time-october) driven by its low fees and high throughput? There's also no need to stress the point that [it attracted more developers in 2024](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-flips-ethereum-top-ecosystem-new-developers) compared to our darling ETH.

The biggest takeaway from this data is the enduring belief in Ethereum's potential among residents of the United States, regardless of its price action. This suggests that ETH has the backing of a strong community with long-term vision and will no doubts finish strong in 2025 right?"
"Monthly Zcash Discussion - January 01, 2025 - Use this thread for general chatter, basic questions, and if you're new to Zcash",zec,1hr1mq2,2025-01-01 07:00:34,10,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/1hr1mq2/monthly_zcash_discussion_january_01_2025_use_this/,AutoModerator,,"# What is Zcash?

Zcash is a privacy preserving digital currency. It is the first blockchain to leverage a novel technology called Zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy and selective transparency. Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount. Selective disclosure features within Zcash allow a user to share some transaction details, for purposes of compliance or audit. 

Development work on Zcash began in 2013 by Johns Hopkins professor Matthew Green and some of his graduate students. The development was completed by the for-profit Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, LLC, led by Zooko Wilcox, a Colorado-based computer security specialist and cypherpunk. Over time, this company rebranded and converted to a non-profit org now known as the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Zcash development now occurs with support from ECC employees, the Zcash Foundation, and many community members through community elected funding streams that originate from ongoing Zcash mining rewards.

Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet unite to power everyday crypto payments,u_CoinsHome,1hm0s74,2024-12-25 08:31:52,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CoinsHome/comments/1hm0s74/flexa_and_nighthawk_wallet_unite_to_power/,CoinsHome,,"Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet Revolutionizing Everyday Crypto Payments

In a significant step forward for the use of digital currencies in everyday commerce, Flexa, a leading provider of digital payment solutions, has partnered with Nighthawk Wallet, a self-custody digital wallet. This collaboration aims to make using digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, simpler, faster, and more secure for both consumers and merchants. 😃

What are Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet?

- Flexa: Founded in 2018, Flexa specializes in creating tools for businesses to accept and process digital payments. Their platform allows merchants to accept digital assets like cryptocurrencies across various channels, ensuring instant authorization, complete fraud resistance, and flexible payouts.

- Nighthawk Wallet: This digital wallet allows users to manage and spend their digital assets securely. It is designed with a focus on privacy and control, enabling users to conduct seamless transactions while safeguarding their sensitive information.

How Does the Integration Work?

The partnership between Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet integrates Flexa's payment technology into the Nighthawk Wallet app. Here’s how it works:

- User Experience: Users of the Nighthawk Wallet can now make instant payments using their digital assets at over 41,000 retail locations across the United States and Canada. This includes places like restaurants, coffee shops, and other merchants.

- Payment Process: When a user wants to make a payment, they use the Nighthawk Wallet app, which now includes Flexa Components. These components ensure that transactions are processed quickly, privately, and securely. The user simply needs to open the app, select the amount to pay, and use the QR code or wallet address of the merchant to complete the transaction. 💸

- Merchant Benefits: For merchants, this integration offers several advantages. It provides guaranteed settlement of payments, meaning the merchant receives the funds immediately without the risk of chargebacks. Chargebacks are when a customer disputes a transaction, and the merchant has to return the funds. With Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet, this risk is eliminated, making the payment process more secure and efficient for businesses.

Key Features and Benefits

- Speed and Efficiency: Transactions are processed instantly, reducing the time it takes to complete a payment. This makes the experience similar to or even better than traditional credit card payments.

- Privacy and Security: The integration emphasizes privacy and security. Users' sensitive information is safeguarded, and the transactions are fraud-resistant, ensuring that both the consumer and the merchant are protected. 🔒

- Accessibility: This partnership expands the use of digital currencies in everyday life. Users can now spend their digital assets like ZEC (Zcash, a type of cryptocurrency) for in-person purchases, making digital currencies more practical for daily use.

Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite the advancements, there are still challenges to widespread adoption of cryptocurrency payments. Here are some of the key issues:

- Volatility: Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, meaning their prices can fluctuate rapidly. This can complicate transactions and affect profitability for both merchants and consumers. 📉

- Regulatory Uncertainty: There is still a lack of clear guidelines on the regulation and taxation of cryptocurrencies in many countries, including the US and Canada. This uncertainty can make businesses hesitant to adopt crypto payment solutions.

- Technical Barriers: Integrating crypto payment systems can be complex, and there are concerns about transaction speed and scalability. However, innovations like the Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet partnership are working to address these issues.

Growing Adoption

Despite these challenges, the adoption of cryptocurrency payments is growing. A recent study by Deloitte found that nearly 75% of US retailers plan to accept cryptocurrency payments within the next two years. Major retailers such as Whole Foods, Starbucks, and Newegg have already integrated cryptocurrency payment options, further legitimizing digital assets in the retail space. 📈

Conclusion

The collaboration between Flexa and Nighthawk Wallet marks a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. By making payments faster, more secure, and more accessible, this integration paves the way for a future where digital currencies are seamlessly integrated into the global economy. As technology continues to evolve and address the existing challenges, we can expect to see even more widespread adoption of cryptocurrency payments in everyday commerce. 🌐

Zcash: Privacy in the World of Cryptocurrency,CryptoForexSyndicate,1hlb0sj,2024-12-24 05:38:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoForexSyndicate/comments/1hlb0sj/zcash_privacy_in_the_world_of_cryptocurrency/,Axiik,,"Zcash (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency that stands out for its focus on privacy and anonymity, offering users the option to shield their transactions from public view. Launched in 2016 by the Electric Coin Company, Zcash was designed to address one of the primary concerns in the cryptocurrency space: the lack of financial privacy.

**What Makes Zcash Unique?**

Unlike Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, where all transactions are visible on a public blockchain, Zcash gives users the choice between transparent and shielded transactions. This dual-layer approach allows for privacy while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.

**Key Features of Zcash**

1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs):Zcash uses zk-SNARKs, an advanced cryptographic technique that allows transactions to be verified without revealing any details about the sender, receiver, or transaction amount.
2. Selective Disclosure:Zcash allows users to share transaction details with specific parties for auditing or compliance purposes while maintaining privacy for others.
3. Optional Privacy:Users can choose between transparent transactions, similar to Bitcoin, or shielded transactions for privacy. This flexibility makes Zcash suitable for various use cases.

**Practical Use Cases**

1. Private Transactions:For individuals and businesses concerned about financial confidentiality, Zcash offers a secure way to transact without revealing sensitive information.
2. Cross-Border Payments:Zcash's privacy features and low transaction fees make it a reliable option for cross-border payments where discretion is desired.
3. Regulatory Compliance:Zcash’s selective disclosure allows it to align with regulatory requirements while still providing privacy to its users.

**Challenges Facing Zcash**

1. Regulatory Pressure:Privacy coins like Zcash often face scrutiny from regulators due to concerns about potential misuse for illegal activities.
2. Competition:Other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, such as Monero and Dash, offer similar features, leading to stiff competition.
3. Adoption:While Zcash has made strides, wider adoption remains a challenge in a market where mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate.

**The Road Ahead**

Zcash continues to innovate, with ongoing updates and development focused on improving scalability, usability, and privacy features. The introduction of network upgrades like Halo 2, which eliminates the need for trusted setups in zk-SNARKs, demonstrates Zcash's commitment to staying at the forefront of blockchain technology.

For traders and analysts, tools like [TradingView Premium](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) are essential for monitoring Zcash's market trends and making informed decisions. Whether you’re an investor intrigued by privacy coins or a user seeking secure transactions, Zcash provides a compelling solution for the future of private digital finance."

In the digital age, anonymity has become both a virtue and a vice. Cryptocurrencies like Monero, Zcash, and Dash are at the forefront of this dual-edged revolution. While they promise privacy and freedom, they are also fueling the growth of the digital black market. In this blog, we’ll explore the rise of anonymous cryptocurrencies, their appeal in underground economies, and the challenges they present to law enforcement and society.  

---

#### **Understanding Anonymous Cryptocurrencies**  
Anonymous cryptocurrencies, also known as privacy coins, are designed to obscure transaction details, including the sender, receiver, and amount transferred. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where transactions are recorded on transparent, public blockchains, privacy coins use advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure discretion.  

**Key Privacy Coins:**  
- **Monero (XMR):** Utilizes ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions to provide unparalleled privacy.  
- **Zcash (ZEC):** Offers optional privacy through zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge proofs), allowing transactions to be verified without revealing details.  
- **Dash (DASH):** Features PrivateSend, a service that mixes transactions to enhance anonymity.  

These cryptocurrencies have become tools of choice for those operating in the shadows, particularly on the dark web.  

---

#### **The Digital Black Market: A Growing Economy**  
The dark web is a hidden layer of the internet accessible only via specialized software like Tor. It hosts marketplaces for illegal goods and services, from drugs and weapons to stolen data and hacking tools. Cryptocurrencies, particularly anonymous ones, play a pivotal role in facilitating these transactions.  

**Notable Dark Web Marketplaces:**  
- **Silk Road:** One of the first marketplaces to accept Bitcoin for illicit trade. Its shutdown gave rise to privacy coin adoption.  
- **AlphaBay:** A prominent dark web marketplace that integrated Monero to protect users from blockchain analysis.  
- **Hydra Market:** Known for its wide range of illegal offerings, emphasizing cryptocurrency payments.  

The ability to conduct transactions without leaving a trace has made anonymous cryptocurrencies indispensable in these underground markets.  

---

#### **How Privacy Coins Enable the Black Market**  
Anonymous cryptocurrencies offer several advantages that make them attractive to black market participants:  

1. **Untraceable Transactions:** Privacy coins obscure transaction trails, making it difficult for authorities to track or identify participants.  
2. **Protection Against Surveillance:** They provide a layer of security against governments, corporations, or malicious actors trying to monitor transactions.  
3. **Cross-Border Transactions:** Cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional banking systems, allowing global trade without scrutiny.  
4. **Decentralization:** With no central authority, there is no single point of failure or control, ensuring continued operation.  

---

#### **Challenges for Law Enforcement**  
Law enforcement agencies face significant hurdles in combating illicit activities facilitated by anonymous cryptocurrencies:  

- **Blockchain Analysis Limitations:** While tools like Chainalysis excel at tracking Bitcoin transactions, privacy coins resist such scrutiny.  
- **Jurisdictional Issues:** The global nature of the dark web and cryptocurrencies complicates enforcement efforts.  
- **Evolving Technology:** Privacy coins continually innovate, staying ahead of surveillance technologies.  

Efforts like Europol’s *Privacy Coin Task Force* and the U.S. Department of Justice’s crackdown on dark web marketplaces indicate growing awareness but highlight the challenges of regulating anonymous currencies.  

---

#### **The Ethical Dilemma: Privacy vs. Crime**  
Privacy advocates argue that anonymous cryptocurrencies are essential for protecting financial freedom and individual rights. For example:  
- Journalists and activists in oppressive regimes rely on privacy coins to evade censorship and surveillance.  
- Businesses use them to safeguard sensitive transactions from competitors.  

However, critics highlight their misuse for illegal purposes, including:  
- Drug trafficking and human exploitation.  
- Financing terrorism and organized crime.  
- Laundering money from ransomware attacks.  

The debate centers on balancing personal privacy with societal safety.  

---

#### **The Future of Anonymous Cryptocurrencies**  
As governments and institutions grapple with the rise of privacy coins, several scenarios are emerging:  

1. **Increased Regulation:** Authorities may introduce stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies targeting exchanges that support privacy coins.  
2. **Technological Arms Race:** Blockchain forensics companies are investing in new tools to analyze and de-anonymize privacy coin transactions.  
3. **Decentralized Ecosystems:** Privacy coins may shift entirely to decentralized platforms, making regulation more difficult.  

While the future remains uncertain, one thing is clear: anonymous cryptocurrencies are reshaping the digital economy and its darker undercurrents.  

---

#### **Conclusion**  
Anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash have empowered individuals to reclaim financial privacy but have also fueled the rise of the digital black market. Their dual-use nature presents a challenge for policymakers, technologists, and society at large. As we navigate this complex landscape, the conversation must balance innovation, privacy, and security.  

What are your thoughts on the role of anonymous cryptocurrencies? Are they a force for freedom or a gateway to chaos?"

Zcash is a privacy preserving digital currency. It is the first blockchain to leverage a novel technology called Zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy and selective transparency. Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount. Selective disclosure features within Zcash allow a user to share some transaction details, for purposes of compliance or audit. 

Development work on Zcash began in 2013 by Johns Hopkins professor Matthew Green and some of his graduate students. The development was completed by the for-profit Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, LLC, led by Zooko Wilcox, a Colorado-based computer security specialist and cypherpunk. Over time, this company rebranded and converted to a non-profit org now known as the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Zcash development now occurs with support from ECC employees, the Zcash Foundation, and many community members through community elected funding streams that originate from ongoing Zcash mining rewards.

"Privacy Coin Zcash (ZEC) Hits 2-Year High, Tops $175 Million Trading Volume,",Blockmandev,1h16pb4,2024-11-27 10:20:03,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1h16pb4/privacy_coin_zcash_zec_hits_2year_high_tops_175/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: $ZEC, the native token of Zcash, is on fire with a 23% surge in the past 24 hours, making it the best-performing crypto asset in the market today. While $BTC and $ETH saw modest gains of 1% and 3%, respectively, $ZEC has stolen the spotlight, trading at a two-year high of $56.93. The privacy coin’s rally is turning heads, and there’s more to this story than just numbers.

The boost comes off the back of a major US court ruling that overturned sanctions on Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused crypto service. This decision has sparked renewed interest in privacy tokens, propelling their market cap by 4% in just 24 hours. $ZEC's recent breakout isn’t just hype—trading volume has skyrocketed 68% to hit $175 million, signaling strong market participation and sustainable momentum.

Technical analysis further backs the bullish narrative. The Aroon Up indicator is at a blazing 100%, pointing to an undeniable uptrend. With minimal bearish pressure in sight, $ZEC could soon break past $57.20 and eye $66.98—its September 2022 high. However, traders should still monitor the market for potential profit-taking, which could cool the price to $49.29.

If privacy coins are part of your playbook, $ZEC is flashing all the right signals. Could this rally usher in a new era for privacy tech in crypto? Only time will tell.

Does Zcash Really Belong in the Monitoring Tokens List?,zec,1gzff2s,2024-11-25 04:57:10,12,0.94,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/1gzff2s/does_zcash_really_belong_in_the_monitoring_tokens/,ahmede2020,,"Placing Zcash (ZEC) under the ""Monitoring Tokens by Market Capitalization"" list due to its supposed higher volatility and risks raises valid concerns. While Zcash, like many cryptocurrencies, experiences fluctuations, labeling it as exhibiting ""notably higher risks"" seems unjustified, especially given the inherent volatility of emerging digital markets.

Zcash boasts a strong market capitalization and significant trading volume, yet this monitoring tag risks unfairly stigmatizing it. Such classifications can mislead investors and harm the reputation of a project that prioritizes privacy and security—innovations that deserve recognition, not unwarranted caution.

Rather than applying ambiguous tags, platforms should focus on educating users about genuine risks and fostering transparency. Zcash is more than just a cryptocurrency; it represents a vital step toward financial privacy that deserves balanced consideration, not reactionary labels.


To CZ (Changpeng Zhao) :

Hi CZ, as a long-time supporter of Binance and the crypto ecosystem, I’m curious about the reasoning behind adding Zcash to the 'Monitoring Tokens' list. Zcash is a well-established project with significant market cap and a focus on privacy—a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. Labeling it as notably risky seems to contradict the ideals of decentralization and freedom that Binance champions. Could you clarify how these decisions are made? Transparency in such cases strengthens trust with your community"

MiCA REGULATIONS (NOT A THREAT),zec,1gt5fbn,2024-11-16 23:15:39,3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/1gt5fbn/mica_regulations_not_a_threat/,One_Expression_7331,,"The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), adopted by the European Union, sets out comprehensive regulatory requirements for crypto-assets and related activities. To determine whether Zcash (ZEC) meets MiCA's requirements, it’s important to evaluate its key features against MiCA's framework. Here are some points to consider:

1. Transparency and Disclosure

MiCA Requirements: Crypto-asset issuers and service providers must provide clear, accurate, and non-misleading information, including white papers with disclosures about the project.

Zcash: Zcash's initial development and issuance were transparent, with a detailed white paper and ongoing updates from the Electric Coin Company. However, Zcash includes optional privacy features (shielded transactions), which may raise concerns under MiCA's emphasis on transparency.


2. Privacy Features

MiCA Challenges: MiCA does not explicitly ban privacy-focused cryptocurrencies but emphasizes compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) laws. Regulators may scrutinize Zcash's shielded transactions, as they can obscure transaction details.

Zcash: While Zcash offers optional privacy, it also supports transparent transactions. Compliance would depend on the implementation of mechanisms allowing regulatory oversight for shielded transactions if necessary.


3. AML/CTF Compliance

MiCA Requirements: Crypto-asset service providers must implement robust AML/CTF measures.

Zcash: Although Zcash itself is a protocol, service providers facilitating Zcash transactions (e.g., exchanges) may face additional compliance challenges if they support shielded transactions.


4. Classification Under MiCA

MiCA classifies crypto-assets into various categories, such as asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens, and others. Zcash would likely fall under the category of ""other crypto-assets"" as a decentralized payment token, subject to general rules and issuer/service provider obligations.


5. Potential Issues

Privacy Concerns: Regulators might consider privacy coins like Zcash as high risk, possibly restricting their use within the EU or requiring additional compliance mechanisms.

Custodial and Exchange Listings: Crypto service providers may restrict access to privacy-focused coins to avoid regulatory risk, impacting Zcash's availability within the EU.


Final Assessment

Zcash may face challenges meeting MiCA's requirements due to its privacy features and potential AML/CTF concerns. However, its compliance would depend largely on:

The transparency and disclosures by the Zcash community.

The ability of service providers to manage AML/CTF risks for shielded transactions.

The interpretation and enforcement of MiCA provisions by EU regulators.


If Zcash or its ecosystem can implement features or procedures ensuring regulatory oversight without fully compromising privacy, it may align with MiCA.

A medida do BC pode também afetar protocolos de privacidade para o Bitcoin, como o CoinJoin e até mesmo a Lightning Network (LN) que usa um sistema semelhante ao Tor, chamado Onion Routing, para proteger os dados durante o roteamento, impedindo que os nós (no caso de canais privados) conheçam o remetente ou o destinatário final das operações.

Shoutout to the Cryptocurrencies that haven't paid influencers to promote their coin but rather let their tech/ideas do the talking,CryptoCurrency,1g31p58,2024-10-13 18:35:12,96,0.75,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g31p58/shoutout_to_the_cryptocurrencies_that_havent_paid/,CriticalCobraz,PERSPECTIVE,"I just wanted to take a moment to appreciate the cryptocurrency projects that have stayed true to their roots and let their technology and community do the talking, without resorting to paid promotions like influencer marketing.  
(Protip: You know a coin is at least shady when it has been promoted by an influencer)

Here’s a list of **some** popular coins that didn’t pay influencers to push their coins but instead focused on building something people saw value on their own:

* **Bitcoin (BTC)** – The OG that never needed influencers. Bitcoin’s reputation as digital gold stands strong on the shoulders of its decentralized, community-driven movement.
* **Ethereum (ETH)** – The backbone of decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum continues to evolve without chasing influencer-driven hype.
* **Cardano (ADA)** – Focused on peer-reviewed research and scientific rigor, Cardano’s dedication to long-term goals has kept it away from paying for attention.
* **Monero (XMR)** – Privacy is power, and Monero has always stood by its commitment to privacy without paying for promotion. Its tech speaks louder than words.
* **Litecoin (LTC)** – ""The silver to Bitcoin’s gold"" has earned its place through utility and reliability, not paid promotions.
* **Tezos (XTZ)** – Focused on governance and self-amendment, Tezos is all about building a blockchain that evolves with its community—no influencer noise needed.
* **Zcash (ZEC)** – Another privacy-focused project, Zcash lets its zero-knowledge proofs and privacy protocols do the talking.
* **Algorand (ALGO)** – With a focus on solving blockchain trilemma (decentralization, scalability, and security), Algorand focuses on building a robust ecosystem without flashy marketing.
* **Cosmos (ATOM)** – The internet of blockchains is here, and Cosmos is letting its vision of interconnectivity take center stage—no influencer payments required.
* **Chainlink (LINK)** – Powering smart contracts with real-world data, Chainlink lets its use cases and partnerships show its strength, no influencer hype needed.
* **Polkadot (DOT)** – Focused on interoperability and multi-chain solutions, Polkadot continues to build out a solid tech foundation without paying for followers or hype.
* **NEO (NEO)** – ""The Ethereum of China"" has been quietly developing its ecosystem and bridging digital economies without shelling out to influencers.
* **Avalanche (AVAX)** – Promising high throughput and low fees, Avalanche is proving its worth with solid tech, not influencer endorsements.
* **Solana (SOL)** – While the project is known for its fast and low-cost transactions, it’s also worth noting that Solana has made waves through innovation rather than relying on paid promotions.

(I think the list is accurate based on my research, don't trust me, do your own research.  
In case I'm wrong, please correct me and I will update the list)

Also I don't like every coin I listed here, due to various reasons but gotta pay respect where it's due.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Edits:

-For people asking why a certain coin in not in the list, I added some coins, If you want to name others feel free to do so in the comments. There are thousands of coins, unfortunatly I can't put them all in a list and also verify every single one, which hasn't paid promoters.

**Grayscale's Institutional Reach**  
As a global leader in digital asset management, Grayscale introduces investors to diverse crypto assets. A listing opens the door for institutional investors—paving the way for increased exposure and demand for [$KAS](https://x.com/search?q=%24KAS&src=cashtag_click).

**Why Grayscale’s Interest Matters**  
Grayscale evaluates digital assets with high growth potential, and Kaspa being listed shows it’s recognized for its strong technology and market potential. Kaspa’s innovative blockDAG architecture means faster, more scalable transactions with true decentralization.

**The Impact on Kaspa’s Future**  
Grayscale’s approval could lead to institutional liquidity. This could significantly boost [$KAS](https://x.com/search?q=%24KAS&src=cashtag_click) adoption across more platforms and exchanges. Getting on Grayscale's radar is a big legitimacy boost for Kaspa's future!

Zcash is a privacy preserving digital currency. It is the first blockchain to leverage a novel technology called Zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy and selective transparency. Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount. Selective disclosure features within Zcash allow a user to share some transaction details, for purposes of compliance or audit. 

Development work on Zcash began in 2013 by Johns Hopkins professor Matthew Green and some of his graduate students. The development was completed by the for-profit Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, LLC, led by Zooko Wilcox, a Colorado-based computer security specialist and cypherpunk. Over time, this company rebranded and converted to a non-profit org now known as the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Zcash development now occurs with support from ECC employees, the Zcash Foundation, and many community members through community elected funding streams that originate from ongoing Zcash mining rewards.

You know, the coins that prioritize keeping your transactions anonymous and secure. I'm sure you're familiar with Bitcoin, but sometimes it feels like everyone and their grandma can trace where that money goes. So, I started looking into other options.

Monero: A Top Pick
------------------

Monero (XMR) is probably the most well-known among privacy enthusiasts. What I like about it is the way it uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to conceal both the sender and receiver. It's like having a digital cloak of invisibility for your transactions. Plus, it's been around a while, so it feels pretty stable as far as cryptos go.

Zcash: Another Strong Contender
-------------------------------

Then there's Zcash (ZEC). This one is interesting because it offers two types of transactions: transparent and shielded. The shielded ones use zk-SNARKs (fancy cryptographic thingamajigs) to keep everything under wraps. It's like having the best of both worlds—public when you need it, private when you want it.

So, I'm curious, have any of you tried using Monero, Zcash, or perhaps another privacy-focused cryptocurrency? What’s been your experience?"

>*... One thing is clear: Eight years in, few people actually use Zcash. The protocol earns about $30 a day in fees and processes just 3 transactions a minute. Its total fee revenue of 2023 was only $14k ... It’s not alone in its struggles. As Forbes pointed out in March, numerous billion dollar crypto zombies roam the digital landscape.

>*... the big question facing Zcash and others is* ***whether there is enough demand for privacy coins in the first place***. *Users value convenience over privacy. It’s one reason why most have shrugged off privacy breaches and concerns on mega tech platforms like Facebook or TikTok* ...

>*Fervent as ever, Wilcox likes to tell the story of a Syrian refugee who participated in the country’s pro-democracy protests early in the last decade. “He found out that he was on the enemies list of the government, they seized his bank accounts, and he had to flee. He used zcash to protect his wealth. He talked to me years later and said,” You Americans don't understand what Zcash means. Zcash is a way to have the rights of an American without being an American.”*

EDIT:

The number of XMR transactions is only 5% of BTC transactions (but about 6 times more than ZEC).

# Introduction

[Privacy](https://haveto.com/) coins have emerged as a significant [innovation](https://fxis.ai/) in the cryptocurrency space, offering enhanced privacy features compared to traditional [cryptocurrencies](https://fxis.ai/) like Bitcoin. These coins [prioritize](https://fxis.ai/) user anonymity, but they also face [challenges](https://haveto.com/), particularly around regulatory compliance.

This article delves into the world of privacy coins, exploring their technology, benefits, challenges, and the delicate balance between maintaining user privacy and adhering to regulatory standards.

# Understanding Privacy Coins



# What Are Privacy Coins?

Privacy coins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to provide [enhanced](https://fxis.ai/) privacy and anonymity for [transactions](https://fxis.ai/). Unlike Bitcoin, where transaction details are publicly visible on the [blockchain](https://fxis.ai/), privacy coins obscure these details to protect user identities and transaction histories.

# History and Evolution of Privacy Coins

The concept of [privacy](https://haveto.com/) in digital transactions isn't new, but privacy coins have taken it to new heights. The development of privacy-centric [cryptocurrencies](https://fxis.ai/) started with Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, but it wasn't until later that coins like Monero and Zcash introduced advanced [privacy](https://haveto.com/) features, setting the stage for a new era in [digital finance](https://fxis.ai/).

# Popular Privacy Coins



# Monero (XMR)

Monero is perhaps the most well-known [privacy coin](https://fxis.ai/), using technologies like ring signatures and stealth addresses to ensure transaction details remain confidential. It prioritizes [privacy](https://haveto.com/) above all, making it a favorite among those seeking [anonymity](https://fxis.ai/).

# Zcash (ZEC)

Zcash offers [optional privacy](https://haveto.com/) through its zk-SNARKs technology, [allowing](https://fxis.ai/) users to choose between transparent and shielded transactions. This flexibility has made Zcash a popular choice for those who value [privacy](https://fxis.ai/) but still want the option for [transparency](https://fxis.ai/).

# Dash (DASH)

Originally known as [Darkcoin](https://haveto.com/), Dash offers a feature called [PrivateSend](https://fxis.ai/), which uses CoinJoin to mix transactions and obscure their origins. Dash aims to strike a balance between privacy and [usability](https://fxis.ai/).

# Technology Behind Privacy Coins

# Ring Signatures

[Ring signatures](https://haveto.com/) are a cryptographic [technique](https://fxis.ai/) used by Monero to mix a user's transaction with several others, making it difficult to trace the transaction back to its origin. This [ensures](https://fxis.ai/) that the identity of the sender remains hidden.

# zk-SNARKs

zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive [Arguments](https://fxis.ai/) of Knowledge) is the technology behind Zcash's privacy features. It allows one party to prove to another that a [statement](https://fxis.ai/) is true without revealing any [information](https://haveto.com/) beyond the validity of the statement.

# CoinJoin

[CoinJoin](https://haveto.com/) is a method used by [Dash](https://haveto.com/) to mix multiple transactions together, making it difficult to determine which transaction belongs to which user. This mixing process enhances privacy by obfuscating [transaction](https://fxis.ai/) details.

# Benefits of Privacy Coins



# Financial Privacy

Privacy coins offer enhanced [financial](https://haveto.com/) privacy, protecting users from prying eyes. This is particularly important in a world where financial transactions are increasingly [monitored](https://fxis.ai/).

# Fungibility

Fungibility refers to the [interchangeability](https://haveto.com/) of assets. Privacy coins enhance fungibility by ensuring that each unit of the currency is [indistinguishable](https://fxis.ai/) from another, [preventing](https://fxis.ai/) coins from being ""tainted"" by previous transactions.

# Censorship Resistance

By [obscuring](https://haveto.com/) transaction details, [privacy](https://fxis.ai/) coins provide resistance to censorship. This is crucial in environments where financial transactions might be restricted or [monitored](https://fxis.ai/).

# Challenges and Criticisms

# Association with Illicit Activities

One of the biggest [criticisms](https://haveto.com/) of privacy coins is their [association](https://fxis.ai/) with illicit activities. The anonymity they provide can be misused for illegal transactions, attracting [regulatory](https://fxis.ai/) scrutiny and [public concern](https://haveto.com/).

# Regulatory Scrutiny

Regulators around the world are increasingly [focusing](https://fxis.ai/) on privacy coins due to their potential for misuse. This scrutiny can lead to regulatory [crackdowns](https://haveto.com/) and restrictions, posing a [significant](https://fxis.ai/) challenge to their adoption.

# Usability and Adoption Issues

While [privacy coins](https://fxis.ai/) offer significant benefits, their complex technology can pose usability challenges. This can hinder mainstream [adoption](https://fxis.ai/), as average users may find them difficult to use [compared](https://haveto.com/) to more straightforward [cryptocurrencies](https://fxis.ai/).

# Regulatory Landscape



# Global Regulatory Perspectives

Different countries have varying approaches to [regulating](https://fxis.ai/) privacy coins. While some countries have [embraced](https://fxis.ai/) them, others have imposed strict regulations or outright bans due to concerns over their potential [misuse](https://haveto.com/).

# Efforts Towards Compliance

Privacy coin developers and [communities](https://haveto.com/) are increasingly [engaging](https://fxis.ai/) with regulators to find a balance between privacy and compliance. This includes implementing features that allow for [regulatory](https://fxis.ai/) oversight without compromising user privacy entirely.

# Balancing Anonymity and Compliance

# Technological Solutions

[Technological](https://haveto.com/) solutions are being explored to [balance](https://fxis.ai/) anonymity and regulatory compliance. For instance, some privacy coins are developing features that allow users to provide [transaction](https://fxis.ai/) details to regulators upon request, without compromising overall privacy.

# Collaboration with Regulators

[Collaborating](https://haveto.com/) with regulators is [crucial](https://haveto.com/) for the future of privacy coins. By working together, privacy coin projects can develop [frameworks](https://fxis.ai/) that satisfy regulatory [requirements](https://fxis.ai/) while still providing enhanced privacy features.

# Future of Privacy Coins



# Trends and Predictions

The future of privacy coins looks [promising](https://haveto.com/), with ongoing [technological](https://fxis.ai/) advancements aimed at improving privacy and usability. As privacy concerns grow, the demand for [privacy coins](https://fxis.ai/) is likely to increase.

# Potential for Mainstream Adoption

For privacy coins to achieve mainstream [adoption](https://haveto.com/), they need to address usability challenges and regulatory [concerns](https://fxis.ai/). If successful, they could become a standard in [digital transactions](https://haveto.com/), offering users the privacy and security they desire.

# Conclusion

Privacy coins [represent](https://haveto.com/) a significant advancement in the world of [digital finance](https://fxis.ai/), offering enhanced privacy and security features. However, they face challenges, particularly around regulatory [compliance](https://fxis.ai/) and usability. By balancing these aspects, privacy coins have the potential to achieve widespread adoption and transform the [financial](https://haveto.com/) landscape.

Here are a few notable examples:

1. **Litecoin (LTC)**: Often referred to as the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold,"" Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee in 2011. It offers faster transaction confirmation times and a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt) compared to Bitcoin's SHA-256.

2. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**: A hard fork from Bitcoin that occurred in 2017, Bitcoin Cash was developed to address scalability issues. It has a larger block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed at a faster rate.

3. **Dash (DASH)**: Originally known as Darkcoin or XCoin, Dash focuses on privacy and fast transactions. It uses a two-tier network with miners and masternodes to enable features like InstantSend and PrivateSend.

4. **Zcash (ZEC)**: Zcash offers enhanced privacy features, allowing users to make transactions either transparent, similar to Bitcoin, or shielded for greater privacy. It uses a cryptographic tool called zk-SNARKs to secure transactions.

5. **Monero (XMR)**: Monero is another privacy-focused cryptocurrency that uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and RingCT to obfuscate transaction details, making it difficult to trace.

These cryptocurrencies share several characteristics with Bitcoin, such as decentralized networks and a focus on secure, peer-to-peer transactions. However, each has its own unique features and improvements to address perceived limitations of Bitcoin.

What is zec crypto?,cryptoQandA,1d1oenl,2024-05-27 06:23:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1d1oenl/what_is_zec_crypto/,maxikaz19,,"Zcash (ZEC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency focused on privacy and anonymity. It was developed by a team of cryptographers and released in 2016. The main feature that sets Zcash apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is its use of advanced cryptographic techniques to offer enhanced privacy for its users. Transactions in Zcash can be ""transparent"" or ""shielded"" using a zero-knowledge proof construction called zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), allowing for fully private transactions.

In a transparent transaction, the addresses of the sender and receiver, as well as the amount sent, are recorded on the blockchain. This is similar to how Bitcoin operates. However, shielded transactions obscure this information, providing greater privacy. The zk-SNARKs allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without revealing the parties or amounts involved in transactions. This is done without compromising the integrity of the blockchain or the ability to audit transactions for validity.

Zcash has a fixed total supply of 21 million coins, mirroring Bitcoin's scarcity model. It also features an optional feature called ""view keys,"" which allow users to share transaction details with trusted third parties, such as auditors or regulators, ensuring compliance with various regulatory requirements.

Due to its strong emphasis on privacy, Zcash has attracted attention from both privacy advocates and regulators. While some view it as a tool for financial privacy and freedom, others express concerns about its potential misuse for illegal activities. Despite these concerns, Zcash remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, continuing to evolve with technological advancements and community-driven improvements.

What crypto is worth investing in?,cryptoQandA,1d1aot6,2024-05-26 16:42:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1d1aot6/what_crypto_is_worth_investing_in/,maxikaz19,,"Investing in cryptocurrency can be a daunting task, given the volatility and ever-changing landscape of the market. However, there are a few cryptocurrencies that have shown promise and are worth considering for investment purposes.

One such cryptocurrency is Bitcoin (BTC), often referred to as digital gold. With its first-mover advantage, widespread adoption, and limited supply, Bitcoin remains a popular choice among investors looking for long-term value.

Another cryptocurrency worth considering is Ethereum (ETH). As the leading blockchain platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), Ethereum has a wide range of use cases beyond just being a digital currency. Its upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability and sustainability, could further enhance its value proposition.

Additionally, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have garnered attention for their potential to revolutionize traditional financial services. Tokens like Aave (AAVE), Uniswap (UNI), and Compound (COMP) are among the top players in the DeFi space, offering services such as lending, borrowing, and decentralized trading.

For those interested in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) are worth considering. These cryptocurrencies prioritize privacy and anonymity features, making them attractive to users who value financial confidentiality.

It's essential to conduct thorough research and consider factors such as technology, team, community support, and market trends before investing in any cryptocurrency. Diversification is also key to managing risk effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Remember that investing in cryptocurrency carries inherent risks, and it's essential to only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

Guide: Binance Futures Explained ,CapitalistExploits,1cwjyk6,2024-05-20 12:38:20,3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1cwjyk6/guide_binance_futures_explained/,kayakero,,"Among major cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance has quickly gained a dedicated user base. The exchange offers not only a wide range of trading instruments but also provides comprehensive glossaries and cryptocurrency trading tutorials through Binance Academy. 

Most importantly, the cryptocurrency exchange platform has an intuitive user interface so that crypto beginners and professionals can trade efficiently, even when using advanced cryptocurrency trading techniques like futures.

# What are futures?

Futures or futures contracts are trading instruments that can also be applied to cryptocurrency trading. A futures contract is an agreement between traders to buy or sell assets at a predetermined price and at a specific time in the future. The following example illustrates how futures work.

>

# Leveraged trading

Binance offers leveraged trading when you interact with Binance Futures. Consequently, there is a question: what is leveraged trading?

Leveraged trading (also known as margin trading) is a system that allows traders to open positions with a larger amount of funds than they currently have. “Margin” is an initial investment that a trader must provide, while “leverage” is a relationship between the value of a position and the margin (investment needed to open a position). Depending on the exchange and a traded asset, leverage is provided by an exchange or other traders.

**Example:**

You decide to buy 1 BTC at a price of, say, $10,000, but you only have $1,000. In this case, you can sta*rt margin trading with 10:1 leverage. Leverage is provided; You put your $1,000 in margin an*d start trading.

Leveraged trading can be used for both long and short positions. A quick reminder of what they are. A long position is opened when it is believed that the price of the asset will increase. As opposed to a long position, there is a short position when it is assumed that the price of the asset will decrease.

When opening a position, it is crucial to remember that your margin acts as collateral for leveraged funds. If market movements go against the position, brokerage firms have the right to sell their margin to cover losses.

Margin trading is generally applied to low volatility markets. However, the cryptocurrency market also offers opportunities for leveraged trading. Due to the highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, a trader must assume both risks and responsibilities. Margin trading is not recommended for novice traders.

# Leveraged Trading on Binance Futures

As you can see in the trading terminal, a trader can easily adjust the leverage. If you decide to use 50x leverage with 100 USDT provided as margin, the position will be opened at 5,000 USDT. Please also note that the maximum leverage for BTC/USDT is 125x. The rest of the altcoins have 75x leverage. Margin trading on Binance Futures is available for both long and short positions. Binance cares about its users and warns about high risks.

# Trade orders

There are several trading orders typed available on Binance. These are:

* Market order (reduction only).
* Stop market order.
* Profit market order.
* Stop-Limit Order.
* Profit limit order.
* A variety of limit orders including IOC (Immediate or Cancel), FOK (Fill or Cancel), GTC (Good Until Cancelled), and the Post Only order.

# Cross and Isolated Margin

Binance offers two types of margin modes: Isolated Mode and Cross Margin. According to Binance, *cross margin mode allows you to share your margin balance across all open positions to avoid liquidation* . If there is liquidation, a trader risks losing the entire margin balance and the rest of the open positions. Cross margin mode might be better able to withstand potential losses.

Isolated margin mode allows you to manage your trading risk by allocating your margin to a position restricted to a certain amount. Once your position margin ratio reaches 100%, your position will be automatically liquidated. While using this mode, you can adjust your margin, decrease or increase the margin before liquidating the position.

# Checks before trading on Binance Futures

1. Choose a trading pair and set a desirable margin mode.
2. Adjust the leverage. Keep in mind that the higher the leverage, the greater the risks.
3. Check the brand price. The mark price is the last price in your contract that is used to calculate margin. Clearances typically occur based on brand price.
4. Check the funding rate (the expected funding rate).
5. Set a trade order.

Binance Futures provides a trial mode for trading futures for those who want to practice before starting to trade cryptocurrencies in real mode.

# Binance Futures Trading Fees

Binance exchange provides a tiering system with nine tiers. Your trading fee level is 0 by default. To obtain level 1, a user needs to trade another 50 BTC on the spot trading market, as well as increase the BNB balance by 50 BNB. Binance Futures fees are as follows:

Which coins are delisted by Huobi?,cryptoQandA,1cteakp,2024-05-16 10:30:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1cteakp/which_coins_are_delisted_by_huobi/,maxikaz19,,"Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dash (DASH), Zcash (ZEC), and Monero (XMR) are among the coins that have been delisted by Huobi. Delisting occurs when a cryptocurrency exchange decides to remove a particular coin from its platform, usually due to various reasons such as low trading volume, regulatory concerns, security issues, or lack of developer support. 

Litecoin, often regarded as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, has faced delisting from several exchanges in the past due to its declining popularity and adoption compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Cash, a contentious fork of Bitcoin, has also encountered delisting from some exchanges amid internal disputes and lack of consensus within the community.

Dash, known for its focus on privacy and instant transactions, saw its delisting from Huobi as a setback, possibly due to regulatory uncertainties surrounding privacy coins. Zcash, another privacy-centric cryptocurrency, faced similar challenges with regulatory compliance, leading to its removal from the Huobi exchange.

Monero, renowned for its strong privacy features and untraceable transactions, has often been under regulatory scrutiny due to its potential use in illicit activities. This regulatory pressure has led to delisting actions by some exchanges, including Huobi, in an attempt to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Overall, delisting decisions by exchanges like Huobi can significantly impact the trading ecosystem of these cryptocurrencies, influencing their liquidity, market value, and investor sentiment. It underscores the importance of regulatory compliance, market demand, and project sustainability for cryptocurrencies to maintain listing on major exchanges.

Zcash is a privacy preserving digital currency. It is the first blockchain to leverage a novel technology called Zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy and selective transparency. Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount. Selective disclosure features within Zcash allow a user to share some transaction details, for purposes of compliance or audit. 

Development work on Zcash began in 2013 by Johns Hopkins professor Matthew Green and some of his graduate students. The development was completed by the for-profit Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, LLC, led by Zooko Wilcox, a Colorado-based computer security specialist and cypherpunk. Over time, this company rebranded and converted to a non-profit org now known as the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Zcash development now occurs with support from ECC employees, the Zcash Foundation, and many community members through community elected funding streams that originate from ongoing Zcash mining rewards.

1. **Wybierz odpowiednią giełdę kryptowalut**: Poszukiwania powinny rozpocząć się od znalezienia zaufanej giełdy kryptowalut, która obsługuje parę handlową ZEC/PLN. Upewnij się, że wybrana giełda jest regulowana i posiada dobrą reputację w branży.

2. **Zarejestruj się na wybranej giełdzie**: Po znalezieniu odpowiedniej platformy, zarejestruj się na niej, tworząc nowe konto użytkownika. Podczas rejestracji możesz być proszony o podanie danych osobowych w celu weryfikacji tożsamości.

3. **Wpłać środki**: Po zarejestrowaniu się na giełdzie, będziesz musiał wpłacić środki na swoje konto, które następnie będziesz mógł użyć do zakupu Zcash. Wybierz opcję wpłaty w złotówkach (PLN) i postępuj zgodnie z instrukcjami, aby przelać środki na swoje konto.

4. **Zlokalizuj parę handlową ZEC/PLN**: Po wpłaceniu środków na swoje konto, przejdź do sekcji handlowej i zlokalizuj parę handlową ZEC/PLN. Upewnij się, że wybierasz właściwą parę, aby móc dokonać transakcji.

5. **Zakup Zcash**: Po zlokalizowaniu pary handlowej ZEC/PLN, wprowadź kwotę złotówek (PLN), które chcesz wymienić na Zcash (ZEC). Następnie zatwierdź transakcję, a system automatycznie dokona wymiany według bieżącego kursu.

6. **Przechowuj Zcash w bezpiecznym portfelu**: Po dokonaniu zakupu Zcash, ważne jest przechowywanie ich w bezpiecznym portfelu kryptowalut. Może to być portfel sprzętowy, portfel mobilny lub portfel online, zależnie od Twoich preferencji dotyczących bezpieczeństwa.

Pamiętaj, że inwestowanie w kryptowaluty wiąże się z ryzykiem, dlatego zawsze należy dokładnie zbadać każdą transakcję i korzystać tylko z zaufanych platform handlowych.

Jak szybko i bezpiecznie kupić krypto Zcash (ZEC)?,kryptomaniak,1c2ehwy,2024-04-12 13:07:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kryptomaniak/comments/1c2ehwy/jak_szybko_i_bezpiecznie_kupić_krypto_zcash_zec/,Ujowo,,"### Szybkie i Bezpieczne Metody Zakupu Kryptowaluty Zcash (ZEC)

Posiadanie kryptowalut staje się coraz bardziej powszechne, a jedną z popularnych opcji inwestycyjnych jest Zcash (ZEC). Kupno Zcash może być zadaniem pozornie skomplikowanym, ale istnieje kilka szybkich i bezpiecznych metod, które warto rozważyć.

#### 1. Giełdy Kryptowalutowe

Giełdy kryptowalutowe są jednym z najpopularniejszych miejsc do zakupu Zcash. Platformy takie jak Binance, Coinbase czy Kraken oferują wygodny interfejs oraz różnorodne metody płatności, takie jak karty kredytowe, przelewy bankowe czy nawet PayPal. Przed zakupem Zcash na giełdzie konieczne jest jednak założenie konta i weryfikacja tożsamości.

#### 2. Platformy Handlu Bezpośredniego

Alternatywą dla giełd są platformy handlu bezpośredniego, takie jak LocalBitcoins czy Bisq. Na tych platformach użytkownicy mogą bezpośrednio kupować Zcash od innych osób, omijając tradycyjne giełdy. Jest to często szybsza opcja zakupu, jednak wymaga większej ostrożności, aby uniknąć oszustw.

#### 3. Kupowanie Zcash za Gotówkę

Dla tych, którzy woleliby zachować anonimowość, istnieje możliwość zakupu Zcash za gotówkę. Można to zrobić poprzez korzystanie z bankomatów kryptowalutowych lub spotykać się z osobami sprzedającymi Zcash osobiście.

#### 4. Kupno Zcash na Platformach Peer-to-Peer

Platformy peer-to-peer, takie jak Paxful czy LocalCryptos, umożliwiają użytkownikom kupno Zcash bezpośrednio od innych osób. Te platformy działają na zasadzie bezpośredniej wymiany między kupującym a sprzedającym, co może być wygodne dla tych, którzy szukają alternatywy dla tradycyjnych giełd.

Bez względu na wybraną metodę zakupu, ważne jest, aby zachować ostrożność i przestrzegać najlepszych praktyk bezpieczeństwa w zakresie kryptowalut. Należy również pamiętać o przechowywaniu zakupionego Zcash w bezpiecznym portfelu kryptowalutowym.

Zcash is a privacy preserving digital currency. It is the first blockchain to leverage a novel technology called Zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy and selective transparency. Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount. Selective disclosure features within Zcash allow a user to share some transaction details, for purposes of compliance or audit. 

Development work on Zcash began in 2013 by Johns Hopkins professor Matthew Green and some of his graduate students. The development was completed by the for-profit Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, LLC, led by Zooko Wilcox, a Colorado-based computer security specialist and cypherpunk. Over time, this company rebranded and converted to a non-profit org now known as the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Zcash development now occurs with support from ECC employees, the Zcash Foundation, and many community members through community elected funding streams that originate from ongoing Zcash mining rewards.
