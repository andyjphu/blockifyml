So what is chain protocol - long read - summarized by CHATGPT for those who don‚Äôt feel like doing the research.,XCN,1i9s4sd,2025-01-25 12:31:32,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/XCN/comments/1i9s4sd/so_what_is_chain_protocol_long_read_summarized_by/,UndevelopedSirius,,"Onyxcoin (XCN) utilizes the Chain Protocol, which is a blockchain infrastructure designed to facilitate highly efficient, secure, and scalable transactions. Here are some real-world applications and why this protocol can be useful:

1. Tokenized Assets and Digital Finance

Use Case: Businesses can tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments using the Chain Protocol.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Provides programmable and fractional ownership of assets.
	‚Ä¢	Reduces friction in asset transfers, making it faster and cheaper.
	‚Ä¢	Enhances transparency, which is critical for regulatory compliance in financial markets.

2. Decentralized Payment Systems

Use Case: Onyxcoin can support decentralized payment systems for businesses and consumers, allowing peer-to-peer transfers and cross-border transactions.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Offers near-instant settlement at lower costs compared to traditional payment systems.
	‚Ä¢	Eliminates intermediaries (like banks) while maintaining security and reliability.
	‚Ä¢	Allows for programmable payments, like recurring subscriptions or conditional payments.

3. Loyalty Programs

Use Case: Companies can create loyalty tokens or programs on the Chain Protocol.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Simplifies customer rewards by offering a unified digital token system.
	‚Ä¢	Provides interoperability between brands and systems, allowing customers to use tokens across multiple platforms.
	‚Ä¢	Enhances customer engagement by offering rewards that are easy to manage and redeem.

4. Decentralized Identity (Self-Sovereign Identity)

Use Case: The Chain Protocol can facilitate secure, blockchain-based digital identities for individuals and organizations.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Ensures privacy and data ownership by giving users control over their personal information.
	‚Ä¢	Reduces reliance on centralized databases vulnerable to hacking.
	‚Ä¢	Enables seamless verification processes for businesses (e.g., KYC compliance).

5. Supply Chain Management

Use Case: Businesses can use Onyxcoin‚Äôs protocol to improve transparency and traceability in supply chains.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Tracks the movement of goods in real-time, ensuring authenticity and quality.
	‚Ä¢	Reduces fraud and inefficiencies in complex supply chains.
	‚Ä¢	Creates immutable records of transactions for compliance and dispute resolution.

6. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Use Case: Chain Protocol supports the creation of DeFi platforms, including lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Removes intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing access to financial services.
	‚Ä¢	Enables smart contract-based transactions for trustless and automated execution.
	‚Ä¢	Supports interoperability between DeFi applications and assets.

7. Gaming and NFTs

Use Case: Gaming platforms can utilize Onyxcoin for in-game economies and NFT (non-fungible token) creation.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Facilitates seamless in-game transactions and asset trading between players.
	‚Ä¢	Allows for ownership of unique in-game items or collectibles via NFTs.
	‚Ä¢	Enables interoperability of assets between games, creating broader gaming ecosystems.

8. Enterprise Blockchain Applications

Use Case: Enterprises can deploy private or hybrid blockchain solutions using the Chain Protocol.
Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Ensures scalability and customizability for specific enterprise needs.
	‚Ä¢	Facilitates secure data sharing across multiple parties (e.g., within consortia).
	‚Ä¢	Improves efficiency in industries like healthcare, insurance, and logistics.

Why Onyxcoin‚Äôs Chain Protocol Stands Out
	1.	Scalability: The protocol is built to handle high transaction throughput, making it suitable for enterprise and global use.
	2.	Security: Uses robust cryptographic measures to ensure the integrity and security of transactions.
	3.	Interoperability: Can connect with existing systems and other blockchain platforms.
	4.	Cost-Effectiveness: Reduces operational costs by minimizing intermediaries and automating processes.

By focusing on efficiency, flexibility, and broad use cases, Onyxcoin (XCN) and the Chain Protocol aim to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, making it a valuable tool for enterprises and individual users alike."

J.P. Morgan launched its blockchain division, Onyx, to innovate in the world of payments and finance. XCN was introduced as part of this initiative, serving as a token designed to simplify cross-border payments and bring decentralized finance (DeFi) features, like peer-to-peer lending, to the table. It was a big move to show how blockchain could revolutionize traditional banking systems.

In late 2024, J.P. Morgan took things further by rebranding Onyx as Kinexys. This isn‚Äôt just a name change‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-scale expansion of what they‚Äôre doing with blockchain tech. Kinexys includes tools like real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments and asset tokenization, making global transactions faster and more efficient.

So where does XCN fit in now? XCN is still part of this ecosystem but operates under the Kinexys platform. Essentially, J.P. Morgan is leveraging blockchain to streamline how money moves and how assets are managed, and XCN plays a role in that.

What‚Äôs clear is that J.P. Morgan isn‚Äôt just testing the waters here. They‚Äôre betting big on blockchain and tokenization becoming a major part of the financial world.

TL;DR: XCN (Onyxcoin) was created by J.P. Morgan‚Äôs blockchain unit, Onyx, to improve payments and DeFi. In 2024, Onyx was rebranded as Kinexys, which focuses on real-time payments, tokenization, and bringing blockchain to traditional finance."

Trend Following Strategies in Cryptocurrency Markets: An In-Depth Analysis of Onyxcoin (XCN)  
  
Abstract  
  
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of trend following strategies applied to Onyxcoin (XCN), a prominent cryptocurrency within the volatile digital asset market. The study explores the effectiveness of various trend following techniques, including moving averages, momentum indicators, and breakout strategies, tailored specifically for Onyxcoin's market dynamics. Utilizing real-time data and historical performance metrics, we evaluate the profitability, risk management, and adaptability of these strategies in the context of Onyxcoin's unique market behavior. The analysis incorporates insights from both traditional financial theory and the emerging field of cryptocurrency trading, highlighting the challenges and opportunities presented by Onyxcoin's high volatility and market sentiment shifts. Our findings provide traders and investors with practical insights into optimizing trend following strategies for Onyxcoin, offering a nuanced understanding of how these strategies can be adjusted for maximum efficacy in the cryptocurrency space. This study not only contributes to the academic discourse on cryptocurrency trading strategies but also serves as a practical guide for market participants looking to navigate the complexities of Onyxcoin trading.

How meaningful or beneficial is the connection between XCN and Chain?,OnyxProtocol,1dgxyqt,2024-06-15 22:43:56,6,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnyxProtocol/comments/1dgxyqt/how_meaningful_or_beneficial_is_the_connection/,The3rdQuark,,"I can see that this community is quite small and not very active, so maybe I won't get a reply any time soon... but maybe some months down the road, newcomers will see this question and start some discussion.

So: **How meaningful or beneficial is the connection between XCN and Chain?**

It looks like Onyx Protocol (XCN) has undergone a fair amount of rebranding in its lifetime. Two years ago at least, XCN was pretty much synonymous with Chain. At that time, you could find XCN's CoinMarketCap page under the URL path ""/currencies/**chain**""‚Äîwhich, if you try to visit that URL now, it just redirects to Onyxcoin's page (path: ""currencies/**onyxcoin**"").

This feels pretty important, since Chain touted some impressive business connections, which unfortunately are no longer referenced on Onyx Protocol's website or CoinMarketCap page, or white paper. I'm not sure when it changed. But, back when the two were synonymous, this was in the Chain CMC page description:

>**WHO ARE THE FOUNDERS OF CHAIN?**

>Founded in 2014, Chain has raised over $40 million in funding from **Khosla Ventures,** **Pantera Capital, Capital One, Citigroup, Fiserv, Nasdaq, Orange, and Visa. In 2018, Chain was acquired by Lightyear Corp.**, the commercial arm of the Stellar Development Foundation, the organisation behind the Lumens cryptocurrency, which formed Interstellar. In 2020, Chain was re-acquired to continue its mission to build a more robust global financial system through blockchain cloud technology. Chain is now operating as a privately held corporation with a newly established board of directors, officers and shareholders.

Those are some goliath funders.

Again, though, this information is now nowhere to be found on XCN's CoinMarketCap page or even on the Onyx Protocol website. (But if you go to current website for *Chain,* which is just chain.com, it still has that information and lists Visa, NASDAQ, State Street, etc. as ""leading companies"" who ""trust"" Chain.)

However, even if the current XCN page on CoinMarketCap doesn't list those old connections and is no longer synonymous with Chain, the page *does* say, ""**Onyxcoin extends its utility beyond standard transactions, serving as a preferred medium for accessing Chain.com products with discounts**.""

So, what exactly has changed? Is it still accurate to say that enterprises like Capital One and Citigroup are more or less backers of XCN, or is that now one-too-many places removed? If those connections *are* still meaningful, how much will they actually benefit the project? Why hasn't there been more marketing?"

# [S&P 500 futures tick higher as all eyes are on key inflation reading: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/11/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose slightly Tuesday as investors await a key inflation report that could inform the path of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy.
*****
> S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures gained about 0.4%. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline.
*****
> All eyes are on the February reading of the consumer price index, which is set to be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast a monthly gain of 0.4% and a 3.1% year-over-year increase on headline.
*****
> The uptick in January‚Äôs CPI figure rattled the markets and prompted Fed officials to shift their rhetoric afterward to a more cautious tone about easing policy. The current market pricing indicates that the Fed won‚Äôt cut interest rates at its meeting on March 19-20 or the one on April 30 to May 1.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe CPI index likely ran hot in February on higher gasoline prices, but core inflation likely slowed further as car prices fell and rent increases moderated,‚Äù said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.
*****
> The technology-led market rally has lost momentum as of late as some of the biggest winners this year retreat. Nvidia lost another 2% Monday, after dropping more than 5% Friday, its largest one-day decline since May 2023.
*****
> Some of the other members of the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù also pulled back recently. Apple shares have lost 8.5% in the past month, while Alphabet has slid 7.6%. Microsoft has retreated nearly 4% during the same period and Tesla has fallen 8.2%.
*****
> ‚ÄúAs the market broadens beyond mega-cap tech names, investors can expect to see more consolidation and fairly modest returns in the high-level market-based indexes,‚Äù said Mark Hackett, Nationwide‚Äôs chief of investment research.

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose slightly Tuesday as investors await a key inflation report that could inform the path of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy.
*****
> S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures gained about 0.4%. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline.
*****
> All eyes are on the February reading of the consumer price index, which is set to be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast a monthly gain of 0.4% and a 3.1% year-over-year increase on headline.
*****
> The uptick in January‚Äôs CPI figure rattled the markets and prompted Fed officials to shift their rhetoric afterward to a more cautious tone about easing policy. The current market pricing indicates that the Fed won‚Äôt cut interest rates at its meeting on March 19-20 or the one on April 30 to May 1.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe CPI index likely ran hot in February on higher gasoline prices, but core inflation likely slowed further as car prices fell and rent increases moderated,‚Äù said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.
*****
> The technology-led market rally has lost momentum as of late as some of the biggest winners this year retreat. Nvidia lost another 2% Monday, after dropping more than 5% Friday, its largest one-day decline since May 2023.
*****
> Some of the other members of the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù also pulled back recently. Apple shares have lost 8.5% in the past month, while Alphabet has slid 7.6%. Microsoft has retreated nearly 4% during the same period and Tesla has fallen 8.2%.
*****
> ‚ÄúAs the market broadens beyond mega-cap tech names, investors can expect to see more consolidation and fairly modest returns in the high-level market-based indexes,‚Äù said Mark Hackett, Nationwide‚Äôs chief of investment research.

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose slightly Tuesday as investors await a key inflation report that could inform the path of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy.
*****
> S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures gained about 0.4%. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline.
*****
> All eyes are on the February reading of the consumer price index, which is set to be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast a monthly gain of 0.4% and a 3.1% year-over-year increase on headline.
*****
> The uptick in January‚Äôs CPI figure rattled the markets and prompted Fed officials to shift their rhetoric afterward to a more cautious tone about easing policy. The current market pricing indicates that the Fed won‚Äôt cut interest rates at its meeting on March 19-20 or the one on April 30 to May 1.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe CPI index likely ran hot in February on higher gasoline prices, but core inflation likely slowed further as car prices fell and rent increases moderated,‚Äù said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.
*****
> The technology-led market rally has lost momentum as of late as some of the biggest winners this year retreat. Nvidia lost another 2% Monday, after dropping more than 5% Friday, its largest one-day decline since May 2023.
*****
> Some of the other members of the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù also pulled back recently. Apple shares have lost 8.5% in the past month, while Alphabet has slid 7.6%. Microsoft has retreated nearly 4% during the same period and Tesla has fallen 8.2%.
*****
> ‚ÄúAs the market broadens beyond mega-cap tech names, investors can expect to see more consolidation and fairly modest returns in the high-level market-based indexes,‚Äù said Mark Hackett, Nationwide‚Äôs chief of investment research.

Fringe Finance is launching an incentive program for $XCN lenders,u_crypto-konstantin,1b2aec5,2024-02-28 11:35:45,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_crypto-konstantin/comments/1b2aec5/fringe_finance_is_launching_an_incentive_program/,crypto-konstantin,,"&#x200B;

[integrating XCN on lending and margin trading platforms](https://preview.redd.it/aj52ycawsclc1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0334f20a8312ef082590d0dd6ce4d1eea1c6cc7)

Fringe Finance has introduced its V2 platform and is initiating the incentive program to kickstart adoption. With this program, you'll be able to earn triple rewards: 

1) From $XCN token growth 

2) Lender interest 

3) Rewards from the program.

This post explores why depositing funds on Fringe Finance can be lucrative for $XCN token holders, drawing insights from the platform's incentive program and the new features introduced in V2.

## Incentive Program: A Catalyst for Lender Profits

&#x200B;

[Fringe Finance incentives program](https://preview.redd.it/wrey7i56tclc1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12ed3f60d8faf01fe0d2ca4fc0094489421e2a41)

This program directly rewards lenders for their deposits, creating a cycle that benefits all participants in the ecosystem.

The incentive program is structured around five lender Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones, with rewards issued as each target is met and sustained.

The rewards, issued in FRIN tokens, are calculated based on the proportion of interest earned by a lender's deposits relative to the total interest earned on the platform. This approach ensures that the more capital a lender contributes and the longer they participate, the greater their potential rewards.
