Help with eye makeup,MakeupAddiction,1i9xib1,2025-01-25 16:26:45,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xib1,Finehairdontcare,,"Hey everyone! I want to learn what eye makeup would look good on me for special occasions. I‚Äôm not a makeup wearer so I‚Äôm feeling a bit lost. Whenever I‚Äôve tried to apply eye makeup it doesn‚Äôt seem to work well for me, it looks muddy and looks off, unless I go for a simple black eyeliner, no eye shadow. 

As you can see I don‚Äôt have a lot of actual eyelid space to work with. My eyes are hooded and on the smaller side. Should I just keep it simple and avoid eye shadows? To make matters worse I wear glasses, so that hides my eye makeup even more. 

Any suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thank you! :)

Use of natural altars? + Question about divination,Semitic_Paganism,1i9xi1b,2025-01-25 16:26:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semitic_Paganism/comments/1i9xi1b/use_of_natural_altars_question_about_divination/,JaneOfKish,,"Shulmu íÅ≤íà¨, friends! As the title says, I'm curious about the idea of constructing ritual space for myself out of natural elements within a natural context. I won't dwell on details, but my living and financial situation aren't exactly in favor of me being able to establish something more ""formal"" in my home. Due to this, a lot of my faith has been focused on prayer and study which is of course very fulfilling. However, something actually occurred to me. You see, I gravitate specifically towards Canaanite/Phoenician/Punic tradition (not necessarily conflating the three). I remembered seeing how people of the ancient Canaanite city of Dan had some very simple ritual ""stone memorials"" (You can see them [here](https://www.generationword.com/Israel/dan.html) if you scroll down a little over halfway) and I wondered if I could apply the sort of thing myself.

I wanted to check in here, though, to make sure I wouldn't end up doing anything improper through ignorance. My idea would be to take, of course, the Standing Stone along with its base from natural stones. I'm not sure if it would be best to do the same for the altar, though. I could engrave both the Standing Stone and the altar and I would hope I can set aside a regular white glass bowl and plate for ritual purposes. Would it also be fitting to use a regular clean, fresh piece of wood as an Asherah if I'd like and to perform the ritual cleaning (face, hands, and feet as I understand it) at a stream? I'm not sure if afterwards it would better to keep the natural elements permanently as my ""kit"" or if one should somehow deconsecrate (and even deconstruct) them to be reclaimed by Nature and start over again next time.

I'm sure I'd be able to make some offerings like bread, water, grain, perhaps even incense (with proper safety precautions around lighting and all!) at least once a week. It's honestly an exciting idea to me since at this point I feel like my connection with the Deities is truly beginning to deepen and flourish. I still need to tear through *Whisper of Stone* and such, but I think I can get at least the Short Ritual Form therein down handily.

I was also curious what the best way would be to get started learning about divinatory practices like ancient Canaanites, Phoenicians, etc. knew them (at least as close as we could realistically hope)? It seems the ancient world had about as many methods of divination as there were blades of grass (wonderfully so, I must say), so I'd just appreciate being pointed in the right direction. I also have Senet sticks which I understand were common for divination and I've even been curious about the Roman augury tradition if anyone would happen to be familiar.

Thank you so much for reading :)"

Drunk maybe 2 drinks over the last week or so and then just completely dropped the ball and drunk and did a coke binge for 2 nights and a day straight. 
In that time I embarrassed myself, spent time with people that I don't even know or like and that wouldn't give a damn about me, called (actually txt) into work sick which i doubt my boss even believes, failed to turn up to check out of my hotel, lied to my husband / family.

Discord? Instagram? Literally just human interaction cause I'm a social person, had a lot of friends in school and now... nothing, for close to two years. No face to face, no other voices and genuine conversations despite my own thoughts. I'm going stir crazy. Tried everything else- from getting desperate and chatting with AI, to maladaptive daydreaming, to fantasy escape in lore, and world building, countless coping mechanisms, they all kind of end the same way-



 me being so immersive in the escapism of this one thing, and then getting drained, turning off my computer, and realizing I've been sitting in the same room for two years, rearranging the same furniture to simulate time passing, while the world rotates outside and my friends actually go through teenage milestones, first boyfriends, car, summer jobs, new friend groups, and schools, all that.



and the only measurable progress I have is the course of my schoolwork, on a computer screen... and at the very least- knowing I'll graduate soon and be off to college.  Still got around 6-8 months though, though time kind've lost its meaning to me now, I've still got a lot of work to do doing that period- academic, dsats, college prep, acceptance- and passion projects. 



So.... HMU?



To pass the time, I've started learning skills, exploring fields of interest, passion projects (Ways to develop multiple skills, and see actionable progress). Data science & visualization, web development, game development, webcomic, narrative story telling and character creation, scriptwriting, animation, drawing, 3d development, Blender, python, front & back end, GUI & UX.  Still beginner in most of these fields, my biggest challenges are motivation, because I develop better when I see progress, and for most of these fields the progress comes in small projects, increments, a bunch of small lightbulb moments for a big breakthrough, and consistent, usually guided  learning over months & years, so it's not the same, and though I'm ambitious, keeping momentum has been tough since being homeschooled. (its tough doing it alone, even when relying on other resources and online guidance.) 

But honestly, outside of these subjects, I'm still 17, down to literally talk about anything and everything, I just need like accountability, and consistent interaction... LMAO. But uh, yeah! Trying to maintain my sanity for the next year till freshman year of college! So...."

The only thing that might give him away is Nora, but I don't think they'd be lured to her either, since she's also frozen.

Joker was my biggest letdown, I really wanted to see what he was doing during this apocalypse. Would his insanity overload the Lanterns? Batman was dead at this time so maybe that had something to do with why he wasn't present.

I imagine someone like Hugo Strange would be **super** dead, with how much blood he has on his hands because of his work at Arkham.

Hell even Two-Face would be interesting, his split personality providing tension, Harvey trying to remain calm while Two-Face is emotional."

Help needed with Silicate/Silica test,ReefTank,1i9xgu0,2025-01-25 16:24:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReefTank/comments/1i9xgu0/help_needed_with_silicatesilica_test/,Kristov_12,,"What's everyone's advice on testing Silicate?

We have been dosing Brightwells SpongeExcel to raise our silicate as we are battling Dinos and are trying to encourage diatoms as one of the prongs of the attack. Our lfs told us to use the Salifert Si test to keep an eye on the levels.

And as of a few control tests tonight we've found out the Salifert Si test is wank. 

We tested; tank water, tap water, tank water we added more spongexcel to and the actual spongexcel straight. All results we 0ppm.

So right now our tank could either be 0ppm Silicates or 100ppm but we have no idea, the dinos do seem to be receding a little bit but not fully yet. 

Any advice? Or recommendations for other tests that are not ¬£50+?"

AIO: Are my friends bad friends or is it my anxiety?,AmIOverreacting,1i9xgpx,2025-01-25 16:24:43,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i9xgpx/aio_are_my_friends_bad_friends_or_is_it_my_anxiety/,Aware-Afternoon7416,üë• friendship,"I‚Äôm a 22F who recently graduated college, while most of my friends are still in school. I met them in college and have always looked up to them‚Äîthey‚Äôre cool, have their lives together, and inspire me. As an introvert, hanging out with them never drained me; it felt effortless and like I didn‚Äôt need a social battery.

Since graduating, though, things feel different. I still live in the same city, just a 4-minute walk from them, but I feel socially and physically isolated. Socially, I‚Äôm struggling because I don‚Äôt have structure or purpose in my life right now while they all do. I know it‚Äôs common for recent grads to feel this way, but no one in my immediate circle is in the same boat, which makes it harder. Physically, I feel distanced because my two best friends now live together with two other girls I know but am not close with. I didn‚Äôt move in with them‚Äînot because I wasn‚Äôt invited but because it wasn‚Äôt on my radar at the time. Now, when I visit their place, I feel like an outsider, even though my best friends insist I‚Äôm welcome. It‚Äôs hard to figure out my place in this new dynamic, and my anxiety kicks into high gear when I‚Äôm there. I can‚Äôt relax, be in the moment, or just be myself. I feel vulnerable and socially awkward. I think it‚Äôs because I compare how things are now to how they were in college‚Äîwhen more of my safe friends were around, the living arrangements were different, and I hosted more often, which gave me a sense of control. Now, I feel like I‚Äôm intruding on their lives.

For example, when I go over and they‚Äôre all watching TV, I panic. My mind races with questions like, ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre halfway through a show I don‚Äôt know, what do I say? Should I just sit down and try to engage?‚Äù I know it sounds minor, but it feels overwhelming. Because this discomfort has lasted for months, I sometimes wonder if it‚Äôs more than just my anxiety‚Äîif it‚Äôs my gut telling me something about the friendships. My best friends constantly reassure me that they love me and appreciate me, but part of me still doubts it.

For instance, I feel like I can‚Äôt rant to them about my problems the way I can with my hometown friends. I worry about being negative or a burden, especially because the past few months have been dark for me. This makes me feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells around them. One of my best friends, in particular, has said we have a sibling-like dynamic, which I appreciate, but she also makes jokes that insinuate I‚Äôm dumb. I‚Äôm already insecure about this, so I take it personally. When I‚Äôve tried to address it, she rolls her eyes and says she‚Äôs joking, but it still stings. She also thinks I‚Äôm one of the funniest people she knows, but the fact that I‚Äôm not trying to be funny makes me feel misunderstood.

Recently, I opened up to her about how I‚Äôve been feeling, and she told me I shouldn‚Äôt come over and be ‚Äúdeep‚Äù (e.g., sharing my depression) because the other two girls don‚Äôt know how to interact with it‚Äîespecially if I‚Äôm only directing it to my two best friends instead of the group. She said I should try to be more lighthearted and just ‚Äúbe myself.‚Äù This has left me feeling stuck. I don‚Äôt want to suppress my feelings around my friends, but I also don‚Äôt want to overwhelm them or come across as ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù 

I know this post will sound biased, but it‚Äôs hard for me to jump to the conclusion that they‚Äôre bad friends, because overall they‚Äôve been very supportive of me and have showed they care about me in so many ways. I guess I just feel insecure around them. I want to keep them in my life, but I find it very hard to trust my judgement. How do I approach this? I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs my anxiety or if it‚Äôs them or both!!! "

Hi! First off all, thank you for reading my prompt! I've been wanting to do an idea with Skrulls for a long time, but never really found a good idea, untill now (I hope haha). The basic idea is that after Natasha Romanoff's death, Fury recruits a skrull to take her place, so the public wouldn't find out. He injects the skrull with a serum that will keep them in that form, so there is no option of going back once in. I seek a fairly active player, creative, willing to write as the skrull for a literate-adv. Lit Discord RP (1-3 paragraphs minimum). Keep in mind, this doesn't mean you would play Natasha as she is, if you want to make any changes to their personality, feel free.

I am starting to notice a pattern with the animation. It keeps doing gimmicks to be able to keep up.,precure,1i9xghy,2025-01-25 16:24:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/precure/comments/1i9xghy/i_am_starting_to_notice_a_pattern_with_the/,LovelyFloraFan,General,"The animators are doing tricks to be able to keep up the quality for the animation, like the Delicious Field and now the Ire Field. I will put this right here, when I post asking about this premise I usually get downvoted, so I will say so be it, it doesnt bother me anymore, so go ahead. You wont prevent me from saying this out loud.

  
There is a legit problem with the animation, it has downgraded to a great degree.





Because I keep wondering why other Toei anime's battle animation DIDNT downgrade as much as Precure's did. One Piece and Dragon Ball Daima can keep half hour episodes constantly full of fight animation and other than some admitedly great animation on key episodes, only about 15 or 13 out of a 50 episode season get animation that is outstanding. This didnt use to be the case. I really wonder why, Go Princess I GUESS had the luxury of the CGI animated final blows SIGNIFICANTLY reducing the animators workload, allowing the animators to go crazy and do all that crazy Sakuga week after week. But Hugtto didnt have any gimmicks and could have the crazy animation it wanted so I dont know what they deal was with that.

  
To be fair, if these gimmicks allow for the battle animator to actually be more than mediocre, into astounding again. I welcome them. I legit teared up when I saw the battle in episode 1 of Mirai Days, I missed action and good animation SO MUCH. I was so happy at seeing it return."

A different way to look at fat burning and muscle loss,fasting,1i9xfzn,2025-01-25 16:23:49,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1i9xfzn/a_different_way_to_look_at_fat_burning_and_muscle/,PurpleCustomer9791,Discussion,"Hi,

I've been lurking here for a while, but wanted to share something that rang a clear bell in mind about how our bodies actually burn fat. I just completed a 15 day fast (longest fast I've done) and am down 19lbs, feeling amazing too after a couple rough days where i didn't have my hydration and electrolytes in check yet. Anyway, while doing my usual routine of obsessing about details and diving deeper into the subject, I stumbled onto something that I wish I'd known during my previous fasts.¬†

Turns out there's a scientific limit to how fast your body can actually burn fat, this feels kind of obvious in a way bit is rarely part of the discussion as far as I have seen. When I did a little math with this info the results surprised me and it changed how I'm approaching fasting.

¬†Quick background on me: I'm 260 lbs, about 40% body fat (working on it), and I keep seeing ¬†conflicting advice and practices about exercise during fasting. Some people seem to keep working out fairly hard, others tend to just rest or get low exercise and there are always tons of questions on how to handle it. I found that kernel of information really crystallized it for me, so I thought I‚Äôd share.

¬†Your body can only burn fat at a certain speed - like a pipe that can only let so much water through. For each pound of fat you have, you can burn about 31 calories from it per day (science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45, I believe the high end would be when you are very overweight and have plenty of easily accessible fat). That's not a ""daily allowance"" you can save up - it's more like a speed limit you can't break.

Here's how it breaks using myself as an example:

\* I've got about 104 lbs of fat (260 √ó 40%)

\* Each pound can release 31 calories per day maximum(assuming 31 as the rate)

\* That means I can burn up to 3,224 calories from fat per day

\* Breaking it down further: that's about 134 calories per hour(the speed limit, not a cumulative total), but this isn‚Äôt all available for you to spend, you have to subtract your basal metabolic rate first.

\* Or about 2.2 calories per minute

¬†**The Muscle Loss Warning**

Here's the important part - if you push past your fat-burning limit, your body doesn't just magically find more fat to burn. Instead, it goes ""Oh, you need more energy? Let me grab that from your muscles real quick."" Not exactly what most of us are aiming for.

¬†Think of it like this: Your fat stores are like a slow-drip IV that can only deliver a certain amount of energy per hour. If you suddenly need more energy than that drip can provide (like during an intense workout), your body has to find that extra energy somewhere. Guess what's protein-rich and full of energy? Your muscles.

¬†Some real numbers to put this in perspective:

\* Let's say I go for an intense workout that burns 600 calories in an hour

\* My fat can only provide 134 calories that hour

\* My base metabolism needs about 100 calories that hour(you need to figure this number out, calculators all over the internet)

\* That leaves a 366-calorie deficit

\* Those calories HAVE to come from somewhere - hello, muscle breakdown

¬†

It's actually worse than just losing muscle mass. When your body breaks down muscle for energy, it:

\* Is less efficient than burning fat

\* Can stress your kidneys (they have to process the broken-down muscle protein)

\* Makes you feel like garbage (that workout ""high"" quickly becomes a crash)

\* Can take longer to recover from

¬†

What This Actually Means

My body needs about 2,400 calories just to keep me alive each day (BMR). That leaves me roughly 824 calories (3,224 - 2,400) for extra activity. Spread across 24 hours, that's about 34 calories per hour for exercise or whatever. The 34 kcal per hour during sleeping is lost capacity.

¬†If I burn an extra 34 calories per hour during waking hours on top of my BMR (2,400 kcal/day), my total daily energy expenditure would be approximately¬†**2,944 calories per day**. This would result in burning about¬†**0.84 pounds of fat per day- anything above this means burning muscle.**

**It's important to remember that the less fat you have, the lower these thresholds become.**

¬†At first I was disappointed that this number is so low, it gives me a very minimal overhead for exercise. But it explains why:

\* People lose muscle when they exercise too hard while fasting

\* Some folks feel great with light walking but crash after gym sessions

\* You can't ""make up"" for a lazy day with one intense workout, you don‚Äôt get to ‚Äúsave up‚Äù unused fat energy, it‚Äôs an on demand system with a limt.

¬†

¬†The Numbers

For every pound of fat you have:

\* 31 calories per day(again, science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45)

\* 1.29 calories per hour

\* 0.022 calories per minute(realistically this is the most pertinent number)

¬†Multiply those by your pounds of fat to get your limits. Just remember your body needs its baseline calories first (BMR), and what's left is w

To be clear about the muscle thing: you'll always lose a tiny bit of muscle during any fast, but the goal is to minimize it. Staying under your fat-burning limit helps do that. The really aggressive muscle loss happens when you push too hard and force your body to break down muscle for fuel, I for one don't want to go lift weights just to lose muscle...¬†Exercise is important to let your body know to protect the muscle, because you are still using it, but there are clear limits.

I‚Äôve probably made some mistakes in here and obviously there are probably some more factors that could be accounted for, like a lower BMR while fasting, differences in BMR from day to night, and rounding to the hour not being super representational‚Ä¶ But I would love to hear what people think of this.

Thanks

I am always on top of everything and monitor everything super close and this morning, my 10 month old fell out of her high chair and her head hit the hardwood floor (possibly a small section of rugged area). She just finished eating and was playing with the cap from her bottle and she dropped it on a small step that keeps the high chair legs together. She kept trying to kick to get it as I was unbuckling her out of the chair, only unbuckled one side but the other side must have loosened as well - quickly half turned around to place the bottle cap on the table and in a split second she went down. 
It's been almost 6 hours and she is doing well and acting like herself, she just has a giant bruise on her forehead that is tender. 
I know these things happen but I feel absolutely terrible and it doesn't help my PPA either. I haven't been able to eat or keep my mind from reeling. We called the nurse hotline at her pediatrician and we have been monitoring her. 
Please help me feel better and not like the worst mom. I really can't believe it happened to me. "

But due to latency caused by the compression, we need to use the Direct Monitor on the Scarlett to hear ourselves.

However when I try to output my processed audio back to the Scarlett via Audio Hijack, it's essentially doubling the signal with the unprocessed audio, causing an awful echo on the Line Out.

They are docked there share of the tips because the kitchen staff also shares from the tip pool and it comes out of their share of the tips. I am half paying attention but nod along and acknowledge. 

Either the employee is misinformed or I am gapped on something. What's the scene here ? I had half a mind to point out we never got our waters but didn't want to seem petty and just left. 
Safe to say will not be returning.

Weve talked in the past. Big supporter of the Mdblist. Quick suggestion for you regarding the Stremio Addon.
Once I add all the lists I want to Stremio, every list is added as a separate Addon. Any chance that you can tweak the process and the lists appear as one Addon?
I know I can do it via Trakt (and I have done it in the past) but since their latest price increase in VIP, I wont be able to keep paying for it and that will limit my options.
Also Mdblist has an integration with Mdblist but once u do that, their Addon replaces the posters with their posters witch I don't wont to.
Your posters and info are more clean and appealing at least for me

i need meals as low-effort as one or two ingridients (not strictly lol, just note that the less the bigger the chance of me trying), no mixing, no nothing. the less cutting, the better. i am not capable of dicing onions, sorry. i typically can't stand upright for more than about two minutes without pain, so i would prefer not tending to the meal too closely. while i do have an oven, i prefer not to use it, but suggestions are still appreciated. 

also i live in eastern europe, so i don't know any names of american brands, so please just say what things are, not their brand names. i also do not have the stores that you have, please be mindful of that as well.

examples of the effort i can take on are putting something in a microwave, throwing something on a frying pan and covering with a lid and boiling something. i also don't have a lot of money, so keeping it as cheap as possible is appreciated.

The ‚Äúlast straw‚Äù for me happened recently. I was at the hospital with our son for three days, dealing with a medical issue. During that time, I had a heavy menstrual cycle and ended up bleeding through my clothes. I called my husband, asking him to bring me clean clothes and help out, but he never came. I felt abandoned.

What makes it worse is that he recently made over $200K in crypto. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm struggling with debt. I asked him for $6,000 to pay it off, and he refused. I don‚Äôt understand why he wouldn‚Äôt help me, especially considering how much I‚Äôve supported him and our family through everything.

I‚Äôm just over it. But part of me wonders if I‚Äôm being ungrateful. He‚Äôs not a bad person, but this marriage feels so empty. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting or if it‚Äôs time to move on.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How do you know when it‚Äôs time to walk away or keep trying?

Global X Uranium ETF: $URA and Atha Energy $SASK **Possible new selection,UraniumSqueeze,1i9xeob,2025-01-25 16:22:11,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/1i9xeob/global_x_uranium_etf_ura_and_atha_energy_sask/,Nuclear_Proton,Explorers,"This week we find out if ATHA Energy ($SASK.V in Canada or $SASKF on the OTCQB) made the cut for the world's largest Uranium ETF, $URA.   
  
Here is why this is a big deal: apparently Solactive determines what stocks get included in the URA Global X Uranium ETF. The selection is supposed to happen soon.   
  
If Atha Energy makes the cut like many people believe it will, URA will have to buy Atha Energy stock starting February 1. That means that between Jan 27 and Jan 31 (ie Mon-Fri) you can get in before URA starts buying $SASK.

Some people think that URA will have to buy about a month's worth of trading in SASK. They basically have to buy at the market which will push the price up if no one is selling.

Now, we won't know if SASK made the cut until Monday (maybe sunday Jan 26), so keep your ears peeled.

The $URA ETF trades about 10x the volume of the URNJ and URNM ETFs, so the stocks that are in this ETF are very liquid. Everyone likes liquidity. Cheers and GLTA

"Hands Shaking, Heart pounding, but have to share my truth anyway..need support.",comingout,1i9xemk,2025-01-25 16:22:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/comingout/comments/1i9xemk/hands_shaking_heart_pounding_but_have_to_share_my/,Inevitable_Truly,Story,"So my heart is pounding right now because this is my first post to a community like this. I've read so many of your posts and I can't say how much I appreciate the candid honesty and courage; Transparency, authenticity, vulnerability to share your truth about yourself. So thank you for that.

I'll try not to write a novel here, even though I love to read your long posts when you post them.

I'm a 44 year old man, married to an amazing woman (second marriage for both of us). We came together back in 2013 with 3 kids each and had 1 together - so we're a Brady Bunch plus 1.

I've been doing therapy with a sex positive LGBTQ positive (sorry if I got the acronym wrong- it‚Äôs all new) therapist. Started back in October of last year.
My purpose wasn't to discover my sexuality, or to even really talk about me any more than was necessary. I just needed help with discovering my sexuality, because no matter how hard Ive tried to ignore, resist, deny my same-sex desires they have always resurfaced - it's been ongoing since we've been together- 12 years - I've always hated and loathed myself for ""succumbing"" and then pushed it away again for a time, rinse, wash and repeat...

Last summer it happened again, and my wife begged me to get help to just know so that she could know as well and we could just be honest.  She's suspected that I am at least bisexual or gay for a long time, even though she admits that I've certainly ""conditioned myself to also be attracted to women, and her of course.""

I felt like owed that to her, with how patient and supportive she's been towards my behavior.

So through the process I discovered that I came out to my therapist and my wife, that I am a bisexual man.  When I did, I felt relief for sure, but I I felt at the same time like there was more to it..  I‚Äôve learned since then, that I am genuinely desiring not only a sexual encounter with another man, but that I'm actually desiring an emotional connection as well. Now I don't even know any men in that way, so this is all so difficult to understand for me; like how do you desire something to your core, but not even have anyone in particular in mind?  I‚Äôve never experienced that before..

I've had a fear my whole life that I am actually gay, I know now that this was given to me by my dad's deep disgust towards me surrounding some same sex encounters I had at a young age.. I learned in therapy that the guilt, shame, remorse and self hatred that I have had towards myself all my life were rooted in this reaction from him and the deep impossible hope desire to be accepted by him.

Anyway, apologies again for the length of this, but I suppose if you are reading it, then it's because you want to..

Anyway, apologies again for the length of this, but I suppose if you are reading it, then it's because you want to..I can hardly believe how badly my hands are shaking and my heart is pounding right now..forgive me..

So Michelle and I were talking late last night about everything and she told me that no matter what, she will stay married to me, that it's ok if I am gay, or bisexual or whatever, and that I have an open door to find a job where I can travel and explore and still come home and be with her and the family - my greatest fear..terror really is to lose my family - maybe that's something good the Mormon's gave me, such a deep love for family - my children are everything to me. I would truly die to save any of them, and I feel like I would die as well without them..

So you can imagine why I fought her on this open invitation at first when she shared it with me..like I didn't want her to give that to me.. because I‚Äôm like thinking what if she is secretly or even unconsciously giving me that open door to let me discover that I am actually gay, and that I will then somehow lose her and my family.  She has never even been dishonest with me..I‚Äôm the one who has been dishonest with her and myself, even with the best of intentions.  But I could hear it in her voice, that she needed me to accept invitation if I really desired it deep down..because she couldn‚Äôt keep living this shame and remorse cycle with me. I finally see that by not coming all the way out, I will unavoidably continue to hurt her - she is truly the love of my life, and I could never do that to her.

She also told me that she would stay married to me for the kids even if I am gay.  When I heard her say that it was like something released and opened up inside of me, and I suddenly felt myself allow that I could be gay, to exist, and I felt this feeling of being ok just being who and what I am for the first time in my life.  And I told her that, and then I knew and so did she..  even though it‚Äôs taken until today (the next day to actually admit it out loud to myself.)

I feel like I‚Äôm rambling and writing too much, but just know that it isn‚Äôt intentional- because for all of these words that I‚Äôve written it‚Äôs been with tears down my face and my trembling hand just to say this:

I believe I am truly a gay man.  I believe I always have been, from my first encounter at the age of 5 with a slightly older boy. Some may call what happened with me as sexual abuse, but I didn't feel abused in that moment, I felt that same warm peaceful feeling then that I feel now underneath all of the fear. The self hatred, judgement and loathing began after my forced confession to my father by my well-meaning mother. When I acepted the possibility last night that I am actually, truly a gay man, I felt such a relief
- even though a part of me was still saying ""don't do it, don't give in!"" I also realized that if I was truly Gay, then all of this resistance to admitting that I am Gay wouldn't be there in the first place - l'd be perfectly content and at peace with identifying as bisexual. But I'm not, because it's not the truth about my core..and I know it.

There's more to my story but I will spare you.   I just needed to say that much to you all, and thank you for your support and just being you, and being here.  I have no idea where to go from here - I feel like I can breathe a little better just sharing all this, even though I‚Äôm still shaking and terrified..lol.  I truly thank you, each of you again from the bottom of my heart- thank you for your courage and example of being true to yourself.  You‚Äôve given me the courage, an example, and a place here to do the same.  Sending peace and love to you all.  -J  üåà‚ô•Ô∏èüïäÔ∏è"

I‚Äôm in school so I‚Äôm busy as well so I thought it would all be okay. No matter how busy, I always try to include him in my day by talking about things that happened but he would always get back to me late because he was busy. For a while I‚Äôve been feeling sad and neglected cause we went from talking and seeing each other often when he was part-time to barely when he got the promotion. What solidified my feelings of neglect was one day I sent him a video snap (through snapchat) talking about my day and he was at work in the morning and didn‚Äôt come home till later in the evening; I understood that he couldn‚Äôt open the snaps cause he was busy at work but when he got home he just watched youtube instead and I noticed the next day he still hadn‚Äôt opened it. It felt like he didn‚Äôt care what I had to say. I would often send him my work schedules (I work 2 jobs) and school schedule to keep him in the loop but he would rarely do the same to the point where I had to ask him to send his schedule (I wanted it to see if he had any free days so I could coordinate w/ my free days). It feels like I‚Äôm always wanting to talk to him but he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me or it's a chore to talk to me. I brought this up to him and he apologized and said he will be better. I noticed that things were changing on his end (he was updating me on his day and talking to me more throughout the day) and I was really happy. We recently had another disagreement and he told me that he‚Äôs feeling depressed because all he does is go to work, eat, sleep, repeat. He said he wanted more ‚Äòme time‚Äô, it felt like a chore talking to me and that you're supposed to feel joy and happiness when talking to your S/O but he didn‚Äôt feel like that w/ me. He said it felt non-genuine and automatic (i used to get upset that he didn‚Äôt talk to me throughout the day) He didn‚Äôt want to mention it cause he didn‚Äôt want me to get sad but I wish he communicated how he wanted some alone time cause then I would give it to him instead of feeling like I‚Äôm bothering him whenever I called him when he's free and i'm free. He said the vibes are off between us and he doesn‚Äôt know how to fix feeling like this and he doesn't like that he feels like this.

I said I feel like I put more effort into the relationship and he said he feels like he‚Äôs more understanding. I put more effort into the relationship by talking to him whenever I can and seeing him whenever I can. And he said he‚Äôs more understanding cause he would be whenever I couldn‚Äôt hang because of school he would be patient and understanding. He says I‚Äôm not understanding of his busy schedule because I would get upset when would go for long periods w/o talking to me (I would tell him to tell me that he's busy and he‚Äôll message me whenever he could but he doesn't do that that's why I get upset). One time when he was part-time, he just said good morning and that he was leaving but didn‚Äôt even let me know if he got there and i didn‚Äôt hear from him for his whole 8 hr shift; i only heard back when he was leaving work. Am i the problem?

Along the way, I am trying learn as much as I can through books and YouTube (can be confusing at times). Many suggest SCHD to be a good income-generating investment to have in a brokerage account (as well as in a tax-efficient one such as a Roth IRA) due to their qualified-dividend distribution. From a tax perspective, that‚Äôs like 15% (depending upon the bracket of the investor), which is not much when you are just starting but can be a real burden after a while, especially if you are just reinvesting the dividends instead of using them to pay those taxes. I am already 50+ shares into SCHD in my brokerage account, would you recommend to keep them and do not put anything further into it, or dump them and move the funds into something more tax-efficient such as SCHB, etc..?

It‚Äôs convenient for both me and my customers. However, I‚Äôve come across some advice that suggested it might not be the best idea to have customers pay directly into my Trezor wallet because the wallet ID remains static.

From what I‚Äôve learned, this could pose a privacy and security risk. Having a static wallet ID might allow anyone to track transactions associated with that wallet over time, which could lead to unwanted scrutiny or reveal too much about my income or spending habits.

Currently, the way I handle payments is by directing my customers to deposit their payments into Binance using a secure link I provide. The link directs them to changelly.com, where they can complete the payment. Once the BTC arrives in my Binance account, I manually transfer the funds into my Trezor wallet for safekeeping.

I‚Äôve been considering whether it would be more practical or safe to use this method or let customers pay directly into the cold wallet instead. Would using the changelly.com method provide better security, or is there a way to streamline the process while keeping my cold wallet secure? I want to make sure I‚Äôm not compromising privacy or safety in the process.

Abusive wife and a child,Divorce,1i9xeat,2025-01-25 16:21:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1i9xeat/abusive_wife_and_a_child/,Positive-Cat1490,Mental Health/Depression/Loneliness,"Hi Reddit!  
I'd like to share my story and ask for your point of view.  
I'm M34, She's about the same age.  
We started dating with my STBXW a couple of years ago and married a year ago and had a child born recently. During the whole course of the relationship, she was quite abusive (I don't like labels, and didn't realise it back then. So below are the examples of what she did, let me know if it's abusive or not - I'd like to know what you think)

* Shouted at me for many hours (Usually starting when I got back from work, continuing up until 2-3am and in the morning, non-stop. (No exaggeration))
* Physically prevented me from leaving the flat (stayed in the doorway), while keeping shouting at me
* Forcefully pushed the door and entered the room to keep shouting at me when I tried to barricade¬† myself in a room to protect myself from her reaching me
* Tried to persuade me that I‚Äôm autistic and tried to make me to go to doctors
* Tried to force me to have sex by making me feel guilty that I don‚Äôt want to have it
* Called out sex organs directly when being angry (e.g. ‚ÄúI let you f\*\*\* my v\*\*\*\*a!‚Äù)
* She thrown an object at me
* Made me feel guilty for trying to have time by myself or tried to calm down after an argument
* Called me a child (and probably other words, but the memory is vague already)
* Constant false accusations of not wanting her in the flat, not being committed to the relationship, not liking her parents, etc. I was always in the position trying to prove the opposite
* Was angry at me for having pictures from my past
* Sweared in the conversations (f word)
* Held my wrists to not let me move or leave
* Won‚Äôt let me go to sleep, would keep being angry at me all over the night
* Called me on the phone just to shout at me
* She forcefully took out my phone, when I tried to record her insults towards me
* Generally often was rude and mean (I'm struggling to explain that, but when people are saying things that sound alright(no shouting or swearing) but intend to hurt you)
* Constantly denied any abusive behaviour of her (Being angry, shouting, rude etc), pretending it never happened (That literally drove me crazy, until our couple therapist told us that she IS angry. I believed that I'm sane after that)
* Talked non-stop and didn‚Äôt let me speak or share¬† my opinion
* There was never a space for my feelings. Got angry at me on many occasions when I tried to share that I‚Äôm sad about something
* Never were able to do something for me, unless I agree to do something for her in return
* Refused to contribute to household costs when we started living together

A few months ago we started living separately and agreed that we should start the divorce.

Since that, she:

* Tried to deceive me to transfer her my money by threatening me that it will cost me more later
* Tried to deceive me to transfer her my money by lying that it‚Äôs the court that wants it transferred (there's no any court involved yet)
* Falsely accusing me of being abusive in the relationship through legals
* Falsely accusing me of marrying her for a passport (I used to be a foreign citizen, the fact that I married gave me some discount but I could have done it without being married as well)
* Trying to limit me seeing the baby by falsely stating that I‚Äôm a threat to the baby
* Limiting communication by asking to contact her only by email

It looks like she's very angry at me because I left her and it just wants revenge.  
I'm feeling very bad because I've left the child. But I don't see me being with this person, she drove me crazy, I was all shaky and couldn't work.  
I'm trying to establish some contact with her, but I am very afraid of what she can do next. e.g. call the police when I'm next to the child and blame me of anything. I see the world is on a side of women and a man is an abuser by default, and nobody would believe me.

Am I a bad person for leaving the child?  
How to raise the child in this situation where it's not possible to negotiate anything with the mother?  
How should I help the child?"

As we approach the end of the austral summer, I hear more and more people talking about winter plans down here at McMurdo. I'm not planning to stay for it this year, but I am interested in potentially wintering over in the future and had a few questions. I guess I could ask people here I figured it might be a good idea to ask reddit as well.

1. In terms of the Antarctic Service Medal addon, what actually counts as winter? Would staying through may get you the little badge? Or do you have to stick through all the way to October?

2. What happens if someone quits during winter? I know you'd be medivaced, but could they force you too keep working until a flight becomes available? Most of the people I know have ""at-will"" employment status, so I don't know how they could force you to stay. At the same time, I guess housing and food are kind of employment benefits. How would that work?

I'd love to get some insight. Thanks!"

My gut tells me their regenerative ability will keep them from exploding, which will basically create a single sorcerer that‚Äôs able to fight on par with the enchanted blades. However, maybe there‚Äôs some Fire Punch-like situation where they‚Äôre able to live with the Datenseki in their body, but their body is in constant pain.

Also, something pretty noteworthy is the Datenseki stones don‚Äôt seem to get rid of your sorcery. It seems the enchanted blades are the only objects that have eternal contracts, while the Datenseki stones seemingly let characters keep, and maybe even enhance, their sorcery, through use of the stone."

When it comes to taking risks, you‚Äôll find Lena Oakley safely tucked away in her picturesque small town in Maine with her two best friends. Lena has spent years creating a perfect bubble free of tumultuous relationships, and anything anxiety inducing. But with a job she hates, no love life to speak of, and abandonment issues thanks to her mom, she is struggling to find her footing in adult life ‚Äì unwilling to change a thing, until she finds a for sale sign at her beloved childhood lake house and an acceptance into NYU PR program.¬†

Lena is faced with staying in her familiar territory Greenwater where the coffee shop knows her order, friends are family, and where the sound of crashing waves is the background music. She has to decide if her status quo is actually fulfilling, simply familiar, or if leaving to chase her dreams of working behind the scenes on Broadway is worth the anxiety that comes with change. Sitting in a dark corner of her favorite bar, Lena catches her celebrity crush‚Äôs gaze. Stunned, she starts making a plan about how to approach him, until he abruptly walks out, rudely calling her out for staring.

Callum Hayes, is popping up everywhere, even at work-where she is now forced to work with him on his ad campaign. He turns his attention to her, apologizing for being brash. He slowly worms his way into her life, befriending her favorite people in town, and showering her in attention she's been craving‚Äìeven if she‚Äôs not ready to admit it out loud. She is determined to keep him at arms length, fearful he‚Äôll use her heart until he leaves like her mom did. After quitting her job on a whim and feeling reckless, she decides to say yes to a date with Callum. Cruising the lake, sharing their biggest fears, and him revealing his plans to stay in Maine making her feel a connection she‚Äôs never felt, making her question whether NYC is still a dream worth chasing.

I‚Äôm a debut author living in west Michigan, originally from a small town near the great lakes in Michigan. I spend my days homeschooling my three boys. THE SUNSETS WITH YOU was inspired by my experiences in childhood and growing up on a lake."
Nvidia FrameView CPU Load - Uninstall/Disable FrameView,pcmasterrace,1i9xe4j,2025-01-25 16:21:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1i9xe4j/nvidia_frameview_cpu_load_uninstalldisable/,TeaAge,Question,"Since updating to the new Nvidia App (updated from Nvidia Experience) and updating my GPU driver (RTX 3080), I have noticed that there is a process called PresentMon that keeps popping up with high CPU load and has crashed my Windows system twice while I was only browsing. PresentMon (PresentMon\_x64.exe) is connected to nvfvsdksvc\_x64.exe, which runs the Nvidia FrameViewSDK. From what I can gather from other posts, this problem seems to be related to AMD CPUs (mine is a Ryzen 7 5800X).

**Is there a way to stop or uninstall FrameView?** I have tried disabling the Nvidia Overlay, but it didn't change anything.

As a last resort, I have only disabled the process. It's not pretty, but it works. For others having this problem:

1. Press Windows Key + R > type `services.msc`
2. Search for the `NVIDIA FrameView SDK` service
3. Right-click > Stop the process, then go to Properties and change the Startup Type to Disabled"

I had left Riften untouched for the longest time too, but I had to level up archery and pickpocket someday (although I never go to level archery, the dialogue option never came up). 

  
I started putting all my efforts into alchemy in the beginning. So I'm pretty comfortable fighting almost anything. I still get bored though. I wish I could mod my game to get frostfall or something, I enjoy the slowed down life. I don't enjoy being overpowered, and keep downgrading my bows and not wearing any special armors. 

  
Right now I'm into blocking, because I have found that I cant be good enough with enemies all up in my face. But even so, I don't know if I should be focussing my energies on block. I doesn't see satisfying. 

Anyone have any suggestions about this? "

And I tested this, if this happens and you QUICKLY slide the volume thing all the way down to a mute and then back to where it is, it's back to being suuuper quiet, but then, again, gradually goes back up.

Why does this happen? It's lowkey been happening for months now but it's starting to irritate me. It's incredibly annoying. I know I could just turn the volume on my PC itself down but I'm so used to using the little volume feature built into youtube (especially when I'm just scrolling shorts because they'll be all different volumes and it's quicker to do) that I keep using that instead."

My Battle with Porn Addiction,NoFap,1i9xdtp,2025-01-25 16:21:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1i9xdtp/my_battle_with_porn_addiction/,Character_Middle6416,,"**Trigger Warning**

This post is highly personal and may be triggering. It discusses porn addiction, ED, findom, and very very low points.

# TL;DR

Basically just sharing my story about porn addiction from when I first started puberty until now‚Äîhow it affected my ability to get erections, how I managed to overcome that problem (for the most part) through speaking to a therapist, and how the addiction reemerged. I‚Äôm looking for support, advice, and letting others know they aren‚Äôt alone.

**The Story**

Ok, a bit of a personal one here, and I‚Äôm not sure if it offers any help to anyone, but I thought I might as well try sharing my experience with porn addiction publicly, as it might help me on my recovery (make the journey feel a bit more real and not so lonely, you know?)

I‚Äôm a 22-year-old guy in my final year of university. I‚Äôve been addicted to porn for about 10 years, though I didn‚Äôt start masturbating until I was 13. For as long as I can remember, I never had much conventional attraction to girls in real life‚Äîporn basically dominated my sexual fascination from a young age. Going to an all-boys school probably didn‚Äôt help either.

To make things more complicated, I was never into ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù porn; it was always bdsm, femdom, and fetish porn. The first site I remember using extensively was a giantess fetish website. Because of the abnormal nature of what I watched (not that there‚Äôs necessarily anything wrong with having fetishes or kinks), it made it really hard for me to relate my attraction to real life. If I ever was attracted to someone irl, it was almost always an older woman, and it remained a very voyeuristic, fantasy-based thing‚Äîexceptionally insular and private.

As the years went on in school, I guess you could say I glowed up a bit‚Äîbecame more outgoing, less ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù (likely because I desperately wanted approval and changed my personality), and started hanging out with a different group of guys who actually knew and went out with girls. Of course, my habit of watching porn until 3am+ never disappeared. It was so shameful for me that my biggest fear was somehow being exposed, and everyone finding out I was a ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù with a foot fetish/obsession with kink and bdsm.

**Sex**

Obviously, this kind of porn doesn‚Äôt translate too well to real-life intimacy, especially if you‚Äôre not in a very trusting, open relationship. As I began going out with girls more and acting confident, I would regularly make out with different people, and even had a girlfriend in my second-last year of school. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily awkward; the issue was when we tried going beyond kissing, I couldn‚Äôt get hard. My ED (which I‚Äôm sure was linked to porn dependency) eventually led my first girlfriend to break up with me.

Fast forward to halfway through my first year of uni, I managed to have sex‚Äîthanks in large part to a therapist who helped me overcome my fear and pressure around sexual interactions. Since then, I‚Äôve had a couple of girlfriends and a few one-night stands. Most recently, I came out of a year-long relationship with a girlfriend who was actually very accepting of my kinks. We broke up for personal reasons (long distance, etc.), but during my time in uni and throughout that relationship, the porn addiction never truly left. I‚Äôd go through stretches without it, then fall into full-blown binges‚Äîspending all day in my room masturbating, and paying for OF models.

**Findom**

This is where it became impossible to ignore. After I started spending money on OF, the ‚Äúrush‚Äù of porn felt stronger‚Äîlike I had a real connection to these models. Then I got into findom (financial domination), an extremely risky form of porn where the dom encourages you to spend as much money as possible before climax. In the moment, you get a twisted thrill from the self-harm aspect, but afterward, you feel terrible. The self-hatred of going broke for this led me to amplified shame and despair, worse than anything I‚Äôd felt before.

Some forms of findom go so far as to push blackmail, where you send compromising info so they can keep you paying. Thankfully, I avoided that, but I‚Äôve seen accounts openly bragging about trapping people in these relationships. It‚Äôs truly disturbing.

I once shared my experiences on a findom-related subreddit, but discovered it was packed with people who prey on vulnerable users. Many would shame you for calling out unethical behavior. I‚Äôm honestly worried I could fall back into that trap if I don‚Äôt tackle my addiction. Like drugs, porn can require a bigger ‚Äúhit‚Äù over time. I tried a NoFap streak last week and made it four days. I'm not fully convinced by some of the claimed physiological benefits, but I do think quitting porn would help my mental health. The hard part is having a strong sex drive, and my addiction has definitely made physical intimacy tougher, especially in casual encounters.

**Final Thoughts**

Sorry for the rambling‚Äîjust writing this feels cathartic. Maybe I can use posting here as an accountability check and for motivation. This community is doing something good, and I fully support it. I know firsthand the extreme harm porn can cause to mental health (I literally went broke, had panic attacks, and major self-hatred).

Ultimately, I wanted to get this off my chest and let people know they‚Äôre not alone. If therapy is an option for you, please consider it‚Äîit boosted my confidence a lot, even if I still struggle with the core addiction. If you read this far, thank you. Feel free to message me privately if anything about findom or extreme fetish porn resonates with you, because that stuff is messed up. I‚Äôd love any advice or stories from those who‚Äôve overcome similar issues. A specific community for this ‚Äúgenre‚Äù of addiction would be great, since it can have a pull even stronger than conventional porn.

Cheers and good luck, everyone! xx"

(She pays me a very low salary and no health benefits). However, what has happened is that she has turned this into me being a csr for her insurance business, making $0 in commission. I have another side job to make ends meet, but after failing this again, I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll even want me there.
