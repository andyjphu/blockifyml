I'm trying to swap my ENJ (ERC) coins on kyberswap and have been running into errors/as in it won't work

their support is telling me that it looks like a RPC issue (no idea what this means)

They told me to go to chainlist to change my RPC

But when I connect I am getting these errors

[https://ibb.co/cgZNsRd](https://ibb.co/cgZNsRd)

[https://ibb.co/WtQxtd0](https://ibb.co/WtQxtd0)

And was told to then reach out to Ledger to ask how to change my RPC

What does ""changing your RPC"" even mean?

And why would I need to do it in order to do an ENJ (ERC) swap?

Why am I having this issue?

It's ridiculous

Saved my 2021 expectations of some tokens hope you enjoy ,CryptoCurrency,1hncqg7,2024-12-27 06:12:17,14,0.73,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hncqg7/saved_my_2021_expectations_of_some_tokens_hope/,BlazingJava,COMEDY,"In 2021 I had this portfolio which I added my expectations of price target of each.

Keep in mind I was still in my second year in this rodeo

To all those that say ""diversify is key"", It's not, It's trash. It's way more important to find good projects rather than throw money at +20 tokens and know not a single one.

Disclamer, I ended this portfolio in less than a month, as I realized I didn't understand these projects enough to hold them with certainty.

I've shifted my strategy so I can follow each investment and get to know the devs & the people involved. "

I am aware that whether I choose to withdraw to coinbase wallet OR migrate them... I require eth for gas. I have roughly 400 enj. Not a lot.

Would it be best to migrate the enj ? Are there any stand out benefits to keeping my enj and migrating them ?

OR

Is there no real benefit to holding onto them, in that case I will just transfer them out and sell.

Crypto Gaming - Past and Projections,KARRATCRYPTO,1hhfdy8,2024-12-18 18:48:36,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1hhfdy8/crypto_gaming_past_and_projections/,tracksta6,,"# Here’s an analysis of 5 notable gaming coins from the last bull run (2020–2021) and some speculative projections for the next final crypto bull run, likely in 2025–2026.

https://preview.redd.it/bp7mhlv94p7e1.jpg?width=2868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64fef3a4641c2550f522aa10c7d76cb35720cc6e

# 1. Axie Infinity (AXS)

* \-Peak Price: \~$160 in November 2021 (\~1,066x growth).
* **-Key Drivers:**
   * \-Axie Infinity\* became the leading play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain game.
   * \-Massive adoption in emerging markets, especially during the pandemic.
* **Projections for Next Bull Run:**
   * \-AXS may not repeat its exponential growth but could see a strong resurgence if the P2E narrative returns with improved game models.
   * \-Speculative Peak: $50–$80.
   * \-Market Cap Implication: $5–8 billion (assuming some dilution).

# 2. The Sandbox (SAND)

* **Projections for Gaming Coins in the Next Bull Run:**
   * **Key Trends to Watch:**
* 1.Massive Growth in Web3 Gaming: Games that blend Web2 and Web3 seamlessly (e.g., \*My Pet Hooligan\*) could drive mainstream adoption. Also, gaming tokens tied to playable, engaging games will likely outperform speculative coins.
* 2.Metaverse Re-Emergence: If the metaverse narrative gains traction again, coins like SAND and MANA could benefit significantly.
* 3.NFT Integration: Coins with utility tied to NFTs or digital assets in games (e.g., Karrat) will likely see increased demand.

https://preview.redd.it/bp7mhlv94p7e1.jpg?width=2868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64fef3a4641c2550f522aa10c7d76cb35720cc6e

**-Top Gaming Coin Projections:**

**-| Coin  --------- | Speculative Peak Price  --------- | Market Cap Implication |**

**-|---------------------------------------------------------------------|**

* \-| **AXS**  \-----------| $50–$80  --------------------| $5–8 billion |
* \-| **SAND** \---------- | $5–$10  --------------------- | $7–14 billion |
* \-| **GALA**  \----------| $0.50–$1.00  -----------------| $10–15 billion |
* \-| **MANA**  \----------| $3–$6  ----------------------| $6–12 billion |
* \-| **ENJ**    \-----------| $3–$6  ---------------------  | $3–6 billion |

# New:  Example of what to project for the next bull run. How a new gaming crypto Karrat Might Compare. There are many new coins in the gaming ecosystem!

# If Karrat follows similar growth trajectories:

* \-	Current Price: \~$0.50.
* \-	Speculative Peak Price: $10–$30.
* \-	Market Cap Implication: $3–9 billion (assuming \~300M circulating supply by 2025).

Karrat’s growth potential depends heavily on the success of \*My Pet Hooligan\* and the adoption of AMGI’s broader ecosystem, including Studio Chain and NFT integration.

https://preview.redd.it/bp7mhlv94p7e1.jpg?width=2868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64fef3a4641c2550f522aa10c7d76cb35720cc6e

# Conclusion:

Gaming tokens in the next bull run could experience significant growth, but their performance will hinge on real utility, adoption, and timing. Coins tied to strong gaming ecosystems or major narratives (like NFTs and metaverse) are positioned to outperform speculative projects. If history repeats or rhymes, coins like Karrat and others in the gaming sector could see explosive growth, particularly during the final stages of the bull market. 🚀

Help! Cashing out Enjin Coin,CryptoHelp,1hgczph,2024-12-17 10:24:54,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoHelp/comments/1hgczph/help_cashing_out_enjin_coin/,BWH44,❓Question,"Help please! I have a tiny amount of Enjin Coin (about $20 USD worth) that I received for free. I just want to cash it out to my bank account. After weeks of trying to figure this out I am stuck -- can somebody advise? I am a total newbie and don't understand wallets, exchanges, networks, etc... so I'll need plain language guidance. Here's the deal:

* I had it in the Coinbase app. Coinbase said they no longer support Enjin so I should transfer it to Coinbase Wallet instead
* I downloaded the Coinbase Wallet app, only to find it doesn't support cashing out Enjin, so I first need to swap ENJ for USDC.
* I try to swap the ENJ for USDC, but it says I need to buy over $100 USD of Ethereum to cover the network fees of converting $20 of ENJ to USDC? (I'm not going to do that)
* Then I read I should just transfer it to the native Enjin Wallet and that'll be easier -- so I downloaded Enjin Wallet, and couldn't figure out which address to use (my Enjin Relaychain, Enjin Matrixchain, or Ethereum address?) Either way, when I went to start the transfer in Coinbase Wallet, it said I need at least $2 USD of Ethereum to transfer on the Ethereum network, so I said screw it, whatever... I bought $2 worth. And now it says I need to buy another $12!

This now likely feels like a scam, where Coinbase will keep telling me I need to buy arbitrary amounts to cover fees. I already paid fees to transfer between Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet, which felt like a scam. Coinbase support has been useless. At worst its just a horrible user experience. This is driving me crazy. 

Please help with how I just get $21 of ENJ coin out easily without paying tons of fees?! Thank you!"

I tried to swap ENJ for ETH on kyberswap

Without notifying me they did an ""token approval"" and took $2 of mine for gas fees

Then when I clicked SWAP it gave me an error message.

I received NO ENJ and my ETH was deducted.

And when I emailed them they tell me that of course they can't refund the gas fee cause it pays to the network.

  
I know it's a small amount but these shady crypto sites annoy me

I want my ETH back or I want my ENJ swapped.

Stop saying ISO20022 is not a thing. It is THE big thing.,Hedera,1h4e6hj,2024-12-01 16:33:01,43,0.89,7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4e6hj,Longjumping-Bonus723,Discussion,"The banks and asset managers are actually going to use DLT. This requires ISO20022 compliance in order to use MX messages aka XML data. This will also include debt management and tokenization of real world assets. This is actually as big as the invention of E-Mail for example. Don't sell. If you read this you're lucky enough to be one of the first few thousand people to see this train coming. Forget the US tax, SEC chair, ETF, utility, undervalued etc. narratives. They are good but secondary.
