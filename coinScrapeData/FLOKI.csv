[Spoilers] Ragnar’s Return to Kattegat Hits Different,vikingstv,1i96v5k,2025-01-24 16:43:51,36,0.89,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vikingstv/comments/1i96v5k/spoilers_ragnars_return_to_kattegat_hits_different/,Icy_Job572,Spoilers,"I just finished rewatching Ragnar’s return to Kattegat after he disappeared, and wow, it hit way harder this time. His torture and death are obviously the standout brutal moments, but I realized there was so much before that which was just as painful to watch.

When he came back, his arrival wasn’t exactly celebrated (as you’d expect). The people hated him, openly disrespected him, spat on him—it was tough to watch. Ragnar must have felt completely abandoned, but here’s the thing: he knew this would happen and still came back. He could’ve stayed away, but he didn’t. Watching it now, it made me feel so bad for him. It was almost unbearable.

This time, I found myself focusing on the quiet moments in between all the bigger scenes—how Ragnar spent his time when he wasn’t with others. A lot of what we see are his interactions with his sons, Lagertha, or Aslaug, but there are these brief glimpses of him alone that really stood out to me. He seemed so isolated, which made everything feel even sadder.

One scene that stuck with me was when King Harald and his brother showed up to sail with Bjorn. Ragnar was just sitting alone in the mountains, far from everyone he cared about. It pissed me off to see him so isolated. But at the same time, there was something peaceful about it—watching him eat while looking out over the pier and the ships from a distance. It was like he’d accepted his loneliness, and it made me respect him even more.

Another moment was late at night before he talked to Ivar. Ragnar was sneaking food, probably starving because he’d been keeping himself out of sight to avoid the hate. Watching him eat, I couldn’t help but think, “I hope he gets enough.” Seeing the mighty Ragnar reduced to sneaking around just broke me.

And then there’s the moment when he visited Floki for the last time. He finally looked like he’d gotten some rest, which he deserved. Helga and Floki were some of the few people who didn’t look down on him, and I really appreciated that. I’d even include Aslaug here, which might be an unpopular opinion, but hear me out.

Aslaug gets a lot of hate, but in the end, I think she was a good mother. Yes, she cheated on Ragnar, but when it came to the kids (even Bjorn), she never turned them against him. She didn’t conspire against Ragnar, even when she had every reason to. She stuck by him in her own way. Compare that to Lagertha—who I used to love—by the end, she had completely turned on Ragnar. And by the time she realized it, it was too late. He was gone. I wanted so badly for them to share one last moment, but it didn’t happen.

For me, Floki, Helga, Aslaug, and Ivar were the only ones who stayed loyal to Ragnar. Bjorn is an exception because, while I love him, there was this one moment where he looked Ragnar up and down with so much disrespect that it still bothers me. (I tend to hold grudges, sue me) Otherwise he is cool.

The scene that really gave me chills, though, was Ragnar’s final conversation with Ivar. Ragnar knew exactly how to get into Ivar’s head, and he lit a fire under him that would never go out. That line—“Everyone will underestimate you. You must make them pay for it”—sent shivers down my spine. He didn’t name anyone specific, but in my head, I thought, “He means everyone—Lagertha, Bjorn, Ubbe, Sigurd (and screw Sigurd; he was a jerk).” Ragnar’s anger, his pain, his wrath—it all got passed down to Ivar.

Ivar was Ragnar’s rage in human form, and while I know how terrifying that is, I couldn’t help but root for it. Ragnar was a kind and loving man in his own way, but he was also deeply hurt by the people around him. Watching his downfall, I found myself siding with him completely. By the end, I wanted Ivar to destroy everyone, no questions asked. Keep in mind that Ivar showed some awareness to his anger when he spoke with Ragnar, but all that washed away when Ragnar finally said the magic words. Ivar the boneless, Ragnar’s rage incarnate. No one could have embodied Ragnar’s rage better than Ivar not even Bjorn imo.

Sorry if this post is a bit messy—I was just typing everything as it came to me. But I had to get it all out. What did you guys think of Ragnar’s return? Did you pick up on any little moments that hit differently on a rewatch?"
Trading memecoins: A complete guide,Kraken,1i8zpx9,2025-01-24 11:43:03,0,0.5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kraken/comments/1i8zpx9/trading_memecoins_a_complete_guide/,krakenexchange,Learn :Kraken_logo:,"# Key takeaways

1. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that pay tribute to memes, celebrities, animals and viral internet trends.
2. Successful memecoin trading requires thorough research to avoid scams, careful evaluation of community strength and liquidity factors, and adherence to best practices for risk management.
3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins 💻

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke. 

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars’ worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they’re highly volatile — even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them. 

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins 📍

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge), [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe) do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/) and [Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

[Download Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet)

# How to trade memecoins on centralized crypto exchanges 📝

As touched on above, Kraken boasts a wide selection of popular memecoins, which can be traded just as easily as any other asset. You can perform direct cash-to-crypto swaps in a few clicks, or set up more advanced orders (such as [recurring buys](https://www.kraken.com/learn/finance/dollar-cost-averaging) or [limit orders](https://www.kraken.com/learn/trading/trade-orders)) with ease.

At the time of this writing, Kraken supports [20+ popular memecoins](https://www.kraken.com/categories/meme), including:

* [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogecoin)
* [Shiba Inu (SHIB)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/shiba-inu)
* [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pepe)
* [Bonk (BONK)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/bonk)
* [Dogwifhat (WIF)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogwifhat)
* [FLOKI (FLOKI)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/floki)
* [SPX6900 (SPX)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/spx6900)
* [Popcat (POPCAT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/popcat)
* [Mog Coin (MOG)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/mog-coin)
* [Gigachad (GIGA)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/gigachad)
* [Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/peanut-the-squirrel)

To get started, all you need is a Kraken account and as little as $10.

# Key considerations for memecoin trading 🧐

As with any investment, [doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor) is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that **memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers — taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it’s easy for bad actors to ‘astroturf’ on social media — making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you’ll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength. 

An example of a potential red flag is an [LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens) that hasn’t been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide, [How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like [Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/) or [Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/) can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:** a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:** take a look at the project’s Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:** as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn’t, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:** can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading 📚

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders. 

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable. 

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading 📖

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that **the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space — ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

Why Thorfinn will never kill explained without the slippery slope theory,VinlandSaga,1i8q0aj,2025-01-24 02:21:47,23,0.85,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/VinlandSaga/comments/1i8q0aj/why_thorfinn_will_never_kill_explained_without/,theamiabledude,Manga,"I’ve seen a few discussions about Thorfinn’s commitment to pacifism and a lot of explanations of his refusal to kill Floki anchored in the idea that Thorfinn knows that once he kills one person he’ll start killing whoever he needs to. A common analogy given is that of alcoholism. The idea is that recovering alcoholics can’t ever risk having even one drink, because one drink leads to two, two drinks lead to four, and four drinks lead to a relapse. Complete sobriety is the only option they have unless they fall back into the same cycle over and over.

Alcoholism works well as a metaphor for violence, but only on the scale of societies, not individuals. Societies, like addicts, rely on violence when it's ingrained in their systems. Once a society justifies one instance of violence as necessary, it opens the door to further justification. This cycle perpetuates because the foundational reliance on violence makes it nearly impossible to break free without completely upending the system.

Thorfinn's case is different. There’s no slippery slope possible because there is no bend to the rule. He doesn’t choose pacifism because his only choices are pacifism or brutality, he chooses pacifism for the sake of it. He doesn’t kill because not a single person in the world deserves to get hurt. He has no enemies.

The ideas about relapsing simply can't apply to Thorfinn, since there's nowhere lower to slip to after killing the first time in order to make Vinland. The analogy isn't like an alcoholic relapsing; in my view, it's more like an alcoholic drinking a beer then instantly dying of alcohol poisoning. 

\------------------------------

The fact that a good analogy doesn't apply to him is what makes Thorfinn is the least realistic character in all of Vinland Saga. Even the most merciful leaders throughout all of humanity were like Canute or Einar; even at their most righteous, they understood that sometimes the quickest way to protect society as a whole was to eliminate those who threaten it. The reality that Vinland Saga shows us is that humanity has not and might never intend to grow beyond this. Societies of long ago would kill the soldiers of invading armies, the societies of the recent past went to war, and even in the most peaceful periods of our modern era we sentence the worst murderers and criminals of our society to death.

We’ve built a society that fundamentally has some tolerance for violence when we find it to be justified. 

\------------------------------

THIS is why Thorfinn is a tragic character, whether he kills or stays true to his convictions, whether Vinland prospers or dies out, no matter what he does, it’s long since been established that the real big players of history, King Canute and those like him, have decided to build the world by using violence to some extent. Thorfinn already had to limit his scope from making a world without slavery to building a society that can shelter the ones that don't fit into Canute's new utopia.

No matter how compelling Thorfinn's journey is or how much his character matters to me, it's sadly a fact that one person simply can't unroot the violence built into the foundation of society. I hope that Thorfinn can succeed in building Vinland, but Miskwekepu'j saw visions in their reality that were 1-to-1 predictions of what happened in our reality's past. Vinland might be doomed to fail, but I don't think that Vinland's fate is the point of the story.

If Thorfinn’s story teaches us anything, it’s that building a true Vinland, somwhere without violence where everybody has a place, requires more than individual resolve. It demands a collective reckoning with the systems and justifications we’ve built around violence. A society, like an addict, cannot allow ""just one drink"" (just one war, just one execution) without falling back into the cycle. To escape it, we would need to throw our weapons away completely and face the storm of rebuilding something wholly new.

The question Vinland Saga asks us is not whether Thorfinn is strong enough to live by his ideals (he is) but whether we as a society are strong enough to do the same. Are we brave enough to abandon violence? Are we strong enough to weather the storm that will bring? Is that even something we even have an interest in doing?

\------------------------------

TL;DR - Thorfinn doesn’t avoid violence because of a fear of relapsing to his past, he completely rejects the idea of enemies altogether. Therefore, there’s no chance of relapse; his morality is absolute, and the act of killing would contradict his fundamental beliefs."

My cat, Floki, needs help.

I will try to keep this short and sweet, but he is my world and this has been very hard for the both of us. I apologize if this rambles in parts. I will do my best not to.

Floki is 10 years old and has always been a healthy cat. It began as an Upper Respiratory Infection that has pretty much demolished his appetite. I have taken him to the vet, and have already paid over $760 on my not-yet-official-Mother-in-law's credit card--money neither of us currently have.

I have been force-feeding Floki \[approved by our veterinarian\] but he doesn't make it easy. But it's not enough. He does not let me get enough food in him to combat his weight loss. It's enough to keep him alive, and that's about it. I have been force feeding him for about two weeks.

I have done extensive research on options available, both for next steps with our Vet, and financing options. I do not qualify for anything, short of loansharks who want my car as collateral. A car that is under my dad's name; my family is financially at their limit, dealing with their own geriatric dog with alopecia. My credit is shot due to self destructive tenancies in my 20's \[fast food, movies, gas I didn't immediately pay off, and a lo/an I took out to pay off my partner-at-the-time's credit card debt. I was ""in a good place"" at the time, and then the pandemic hit after I had been perfectly on time/early for years and everything went to dookie from there.\] 

I have a job lined up, but it won't be officially on paper until next week, and I won't get paid until 2-3 weeks after that. Even then, I still won't have enough to pay immediately out of pocket.

This cat is my world. He's been with me for ten years, through what I believed to be the hardest points of my life. Little did I know... ***this*** is the hardest point of my life. And I'm at a loss. I am trying everything. I'm *still* sending out applications daily, *just in case*. I'm looking through the same lo.an/credit/veterinarian assistance programs daily. I feel like I'm courting insanity here. I'm desperate.

I have a GoFundMe here: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-help-for-flokis-lifesaving-treatment](https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-help-for-flokis-lifesaving-treatment)  
I have other means of donations I don't want to mention to respect this sub's rules. I appreciate the help this subreddit offers, and I don't want to mess anything up for myself, or for others. 

I have tried spreading the word on social media, but I do not have online friends, and do not post much, if at all, to have a following. I even *paid* for the cheapest promotional on TikTok and didn't have any luck.

I will be posting this to other subs in search of aid. I truly am desperate here. I want to save him. I don't want to lose him just because ***I'm poor***. I already know I'm to blame for the situation I'm in. I've learned my lessons, and I'm trying my best to do better, to fix the things I've messed up. I have payment plans set up to fix my debts, I have a new job with lots of potential for someone like me with management experience, I kicked my fast food/gam.ing addictions, and I'm actually keeping a calendar planner for the first time in my life. 

I need him. He's my boy. He's showing a lot of signs of promise. His bloodwork was *good*. He's active, he's interested in things, he still wants attention and stimulus. He just won't eat. I want to pursue the option of having an oesophageal feeding tube implanted until he has the strength to get on his feet again. It'll minimize the stress ordinary forcefeeding causes, and prevents them from becoming more food adverse than he already is. He's *telling* me he can make it through this just by the way he's acting. I ***know*** he can make it through this, but I need help. 

  
Any engagement is good engagement. Please keep him in your thoughts. Light a candle for my boy. 

Please and thank you.

Vet Assistance for Bad Credit? [I need real help here...],catcare,1i8aerm,2025-01-23 13:36:00,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/catcare/comments/1i8aerm/vet_assistance_for_bad_credit_i_need_real_help/,yeeee-throwaway,,"My cat has been going through a rough period of a hunger strike after what we suspect to be a URI.

Yes, we have taken him to a vet. We have had blood work done. His results have been promising with nothing on his blood work showing anything wrong. Our theory is that the URI just fucked up his eating habits. He's still boogery a little, and *occasionally* nauseated \[lip-smacking when wet food is around\].

Floki is 10 years old. I know he's considered ""senior"" but he's still *young*. He has a lot of life in him. Even after all of this, he's still pretty active. He's lost weight, and it's clear that his hunger strike is getting to him. We have been force feeding him \[vet approved\] best we can, but he doesn't make it easy. He isn't getting the nutrition he needs, but *anything* is better than nothing at this point.

I have had to put his vet bills on my unofficial mother-in-laws credit card because I was a self destructive fool in my 20's, and have nothing to show for it. I burned my credit to about 500-600something depending on where you look, and currently have active debt I cannot pay. \[Not for a lack of trying. Work here is hard to come by, and I'm awaiting word for an opportunity and should receive a job offer by mid next week. But it'll still be another 2-3 weeks after that before my first check.\] I have already put $800 on my MIL's credit, but I want to do more for him. 

Floki is my everything. He's my rock. He's been with me through what I thought were the worst points in my life--turns out ***this*** is the worst thing I've ever been through. The mere *thought* of losing him early simply because *I'm poor because of my own stupid self* has me crying every other hour for the past month. 

He's *strong*. He shows *interest* in food, and is drinking water. He just can't bring himself to eat. We tried anti-nausea medication, and an appetite stimulant; Nothing. He ate a little of the inside-meat of a rotisserie chicken about a week ago, and a few tiny pieces of ""unflavored"" deli ham. \[I know, don't feed regularly, I know. Again, *anything is better than nothing.\]* Tried to tempt him with some ""pizza"" \[made a little plate of shredded pepperoni and some cheese (again, *I know*, my *vet* recommended trying this stuff\], and still nothing. \[He used to straight up *harass* me when I ate pizza. Would try to steal it off my plate. Was somewhat successful when he was younger and I wasn't watching. He licked some of the cheese from his special ""pizza plate"" but that was it.

Force feeding him is hard on both of us, Floki and I, and I know it's added to his food aversion \[towards wet food especially\]. Our relationship is still good. He still cuddles with me, and doesn't run and hide immediately after. He actually stopped at the water bowl for the first time after a feeding session to wash it down.

I grew up with cats, helped rehab strays growing up, but with the dozens of cats I've met, I have ***never*** met a cat like Floki. There is a bond I have with him that's unlike anything I've ever had. He's a smart, loving, quirky boy and I love him with every fiber of my being. I would burn the world down for him.

My hate for myself is what's gotten in the way of his treatment. It's my fault we're in this situation, and I know that. I'm working on doing better, but I can't pull a miracle out of my ass.

I want to get an oesophageal feeding tube implanted, another round of subcutaneous fluid, and more anti-nausea meds for him, but that will likely run me upwards of $400+. I literally have $40 in my bank account. I am sending out applications daily. Everywhere. Anywhere. I have work experience as a supervisor/manager with multi-years with certain companies. It's the job market here that's the problem.

Honestly, I'm desperate. Desperate enough to consider the worst low credit loan sharks out there. Worst part is, I have nothing for collateral. My car is under my dad's name. My family has their own vet bills with a geriatric dog of theirs with alopecia. My in-laws are about to have even *less* money than they already have. I don't qualify for unemployment, or disability \[Despite being disabled. /shrug I'm lying on resumes and intend to work myself to death, tbh. Fuck me, and my pain. My boy needs me and there isn't a single thing on this earth I *won't* do.\]

I'd be out on a street corner right this very second, *if it were legal.* Might make an OnlyFeet or whateverthefck later after I pick up more pate food for him. Might even try to break into the over-saturated self-run ""adult entertainment"" markets. I don't care, I am *desperate.*

Yes, I set up a GoFundMe already and tried to spread the word on social media. The problem is, I never post on social media and have no online friends. I have no followers, and people don't want to see ""sob stories"" asking for help. They scroll right past. I even paid $10 to promote my TikTok video. Nothing.

I ***know*** Floki can bounce back from this. I know he can. Everything he's showing me *proves* that he can. He's active, alive, aware. Just losing weight. He's not jaundiced. He's just sick, and he ***can*** be saved. I'm just *poor*, and it's my fault, and if I lose him like this I'll never forgive myself. 



My Question is this:  
\- Are there any vet bill assistance programs that will give us a chance? I have bad credit, and am not currently employed. My partner is disabled and can't work, and unable to qualify for disability because we are not covered by medical insurance \[and do not qualify for govt assistance, we've tried\].  
\- Bad credit loans you'd recommend?  
\- I can't afford security deposits on a credit card, and I already have debt with Capital One. \[I have worked out a payment plan for this one once the new job is officially secure. I have the job, I just have to *wait*.\]



Dear Mods: Please let this be okay with the rules. I just want to help him. I'm not advertising. I won't share my GoFundMe, or any links. I just need help and advice. I'm not trying to turn this into a big ""oh woe is me"" pity party. I need him. He's my boy. He's the closest thing I'll ever have to a son. I know they're not with us forever, and I know I will lose him eventually. But not like this. Not when he still has so much life left in him. Not because ***I*** am a failure.

I genuinely wish it was me. It *should* be me. He's normally so, *so* healthy. This is my fault for trying to numb my 20's with fast food and short-lived dopamine. The only thing I can be proud of is at least I wasn't spending all that credit on drugs or alcohol. \[My liver can't process it properly. Alcohol, not drugs, and I'd be too afraid to try it. For multitudes of reasons. Main thing being jail time. I'm 4ft 11in, I'd perish in prison.\]

Any engagement is good engagement. Please and thank you for your time. I appreciate y'all. Please stay hydrated. Keep Floki in your thoughts. Witches, light a candle for him.

THE $MOG THESIS,mogcoin,1i76pjl,2025-01-22 03:37:17,57,0.99,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/mogcoin/comments/1i76pjl/the_mog_thesis/,bataillehack,,"MOG is the top meme for this cycle. 100bn is fud.

In our biggest, most speculative cycle (our dot com moment), MOG is objectively the best positioned to be at the top.

4 reasons...

MOG has:
1.  Complete hivemind saturation
2. The strongest ""shiny new thing"" factors
3. A favourable macro backdrop
4. The most attractive mcap perspective

I will lay out each reason and each reason will have sub-reasons that I will label as 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc etc. References to other tweets will be attached as comments. 

1. Hivemind saturation

MOG has complete hivemind saturation, it has permeated into every facet you can think of.

It has permeated:
1.1. Normie culture
1.2. Crypto culture

And the fact that its a(n):
1.3. Verb
1.4. Emoji

makes it incredibly sticky.

1.1. Normie culture

Unlike the vast majority of crypto memes, MOG started out as a normie meme. Starting out from the fringes of the internet, it has been evolved to become a mainstream phenomenon that zoomers and gen alpha has come to love.

Defined as essentially dominating in appearance, it has been highly associated with the ongoing looksmaxxing trend today. 

I have documented how pervasive this trend has been on tiktok. (see comment below)

Zoomers are the new market entrants, it makes sense to have something that they are familiar with. It is human nature to seek out what is familiar in an unfamiliar environment.

1.2. Crypto culture

The past several months have shown that MOG has developed a unique crypto culture as well. Revolving around the wearing of Pit Vipers and the assertion of dominance over other projects, it parallels the normie culture very well.

The Pit Vipers are a mark of tribe association and ""winning at everything you do"" is the culture of the tribe.

We have seen how everyone wants to be associated with this as it speaks to the inherent desire to do better and the Pit Vipers have become a symbol of ""coolness.""

Take a look around CT and the Pit Vipers on pfps are quickly becoming the lazer eyes of this cycle.

I also have documented how sticky this is in irl in my post about Art Basel below in the comments.

1.3. Verb

Imagine being able to bet on the proliferation of an evolving verb in the largest, most dominant language in the world.

I've said this in a prev post (see below in the comments) about how a trending verb can easily seep into the mainstream hivemind as it is used in everyday conversation/ context.

The constant use and it being new gives it a huge competitive advantage over other memes.

You can use the term ""MOG,"" in virtually any context, you cannot do so with others.
“That person mogs,"" ""That person's getting mogged,"" etc etc. Makes sense..
“That person bonks? doges? pepes?"" Doesn't really make sense..
You can only partially do it with WIF, only in the context of ""with."" 

Also MOG being a new verb is just that, new. It will literally stand out on its own given that there is an aura of excitement and relatedable-ness with its use (compared to other verbs/ words).

What's more sticky?
""I dominated that person."" or,
""I mogged that person."" 
Obviously mogged is more sticky, its the same reason why our millennial generation used the word ""owned/ pwned.""

1.4. Emoji

This is extremely simple. It's very similar to the joy cat emoji on your phone. 

The joy cat emoji is on every smartphone/ laptop/ computer/ ipad/ tablet.

The world approximately has: 
- 5 billion people with smartphones
- 7 billion smartphones
- 2 billion laptops/ computers
- 1 billion tablets

Talk about instant recognizability.

MOG has seeped into normie and crypto culture, is an evolving/ trending verb used by the youth, and has brand association accessibility on virtually every device in the world.

I think it is safe to say, MOG has complete hivemind saturation.

2. The strongest ""shiny new thing ""factors

There is a reason why each cycle's top performers are the new things. ""New"" is fresh, has less bagholders as sell pressure, and allows for speculators to look further into the future which results in higher levels of speculation.

MOG has THE STRONGEST new shiny factors.

Two specifically: 
2.1. V2 vs V1 meme evolution
2.2. Cats 

(the new verb aspect can also be included here but i will be excluding it as I've already gone through it above.)

2.1. V2 vs V1

I've mentioned it before, memes are evolving from a flat plain old dog meme/ memes of the past (V1) to something thats dynamic and revolves around an evolving culture and language (V2).

Theres simply more speech, statements, sayings, vocabulary, actions, etc etc associated with V2 when compared with V1. 

Theres just more content potential. This is a game of attention. Hence more content -> more attention -> higher mcap.

There is so much more space for activity given a cultural premise
- “tokenized winning”
- “this coin mogs all other coins”
- “be a winner at everything you do”
- mogged, mogging, mogs

A meme is a transfer of social information. By default, a culture around that will be greater than a simple meme. All you can do with V1 memes is just proliferate the meme itself. If its DOGE,  you say ""DOGE to a dollar"" or ""much wow,"" you can't do much else. You can't act upon it to show you DOGE or dress up as DOGE. Even if you put on a hat and use ""wif"" instead of  ""with,"" thats all you can do. There's not much else.

With MOG, you can literally MOG people, wear the Vipers and take a selfie, do the looksmaxxing stuff, do the gym bro stuff, if you think you look good show it off, make funny content, joke about it with your friends, you can bust ppl's balls.. there is just simply more stuff to do.

Why do you think countries/ ethnicities/ religions have culture? So the shit survives and thrives. Literally simple as that. It is no coincidence that countries with strong cultures are also the most relevant in the world stage. 

2.2. Cats

This one is extremely straight forward. Last cycle was the cycle of the dogs. This cycle will be the cycle of the cats.

In the US:
- 65 mil dog owners
- 46 mil cat owners

The mcaps simply don't reflect this. But, it will this cycle and imo, cats will overshoot given that it is ""new"" and ""new"" things tend to get a price premium.

The dogs are simply over done. There are mental ceilings to them.

I esp love WIF but its the 5th iteration of the main dog coin after theres been dozens of attempts.

Cats didnt get their attention last cycle and its so easy for a mental shift from dogs to cat, its perfectly familiar enough and new enough.

And guess what, MOG is positioned as the top cat.
- top cat = top dog
- MOG = DOGE
- add ""new"" factor premium + bigger cycle = MOG > DOGE imo

Don't mid curve it, this is the most left curve thing ever.
Dogs ran so cats will run, and like every time, ppl will get over exuberant which leads to an extra premium, simple as that. 

MOG is literally the new evolved form of ""memes"" and is the top cat coin. It is literally the top contender for checking for ""new"" factors, simple as that. 

3. Favourable macro backdrop

If you seriously assess the current macro backdrop, you will come to the conclusion that memes (and esp the TOP memes like MOG) will be the greatest opportunity for gen wealth.

Two things we'll go over:
3.1. Memes as THE macro trade
3.2. MOG as the counter culture trend

3.1. Memes as THE macro trade

We all know money printing. 
We all know our governments are over indebted. 
We all know a 9-5 isn't enough to make it. 
We all know things are becoming more and more expensive. 
We all know things aren't right and we're getting screwed.

Why do you think the normies are sports gambling?
Why did we had the memestock saga?

These are all symptoms of the same thing.
The masses just haven't fully figured it out, but they will.

Those of us in crypto understand that the solution is crypto, that you need to speculate on the most speculative asset class to get ahead. 

To zoom in even further, if you want true gen wealth, the large cap coins and tokens aren't enough. 
You need to go further out on the risk curve.
You need to go where ppl aren't looking/ taking it seriously. 
You need to get into the consensus trades before they become consensus.
You need memecoins.

Memecoins are THE macro trade.

But lets dig deeper... Why MOG?

3.2. MOG as the counter culture trend

Its bc MOG embodies the current counter cultural environment.

The current environment is a result of the sequence of the overall counter cultural trend thats been going on.

From the polarization of the left or right, BLM, Andrew Tate, identity politics, vax vs unvax, social/ wealth ineqaulity, Trump fandom, to our usage of memes/ adoption of alternative forms of media, they all speak to the same underlying theme...

We were told one thing but reality was another thing, so we wanted to diverge and rebel.

Most millennials and zoomers grew up in a cookie cutter world where, how we grew up and actual reality were two vastly different things. 

We were told to be extra nice to each other to get a gold star, and that following the given path of school and work will lead to us receiving the social and economic benefits prev gens got.

We all know that ain't the actual outcome.

So this leaves us in the current environment. And MOG embodies that environment perfectly. 

As silly as the mogging trend may be, it perfectly highlights the underlying reality of our culture. 

Its the realization that what cookie cutter world sold to us is not the reality. It is the manifestation of that realization as a cultural trend/ meme. 

Its the realization that it is a MOG or get MOGGED world.
You dominate or get dominated.

Its the realization that this primal set up has been the only persistent and reliable setup in all of human history and zoomers are merely adopting and memeing that outlook bc they are tired of the bs and happen to be masters of memes.

It's not just some silly tiktok trend. It speaks to the overarching reality of today's world.

MOG is literally a nod to the current ""big picture.""

Imagine being able to bet on the encompassing macro picture while everyone's not taking it seriously.

And also as a side note, it is important to note Pit Vipers themselves being counter culture. Most sunglasses are owned by EssilorLuxxotica, Pit Vipers remains privately owned. Even their biggest competitors such as Oakleys are under the Luxxotica umbrella. Pit Vipers do a really good job of going against the grain and imo is a primary reason why ppl love them so much. Just look at their marketing, branding, and design, they all deviate from what is the current culture in the realm of sunglasses.

4. The most attractive mcap perspective

MOG by far is has the most attractive upside from a mcap perspective.

It was mentioned in a prev post (attached as a comment below), but this will be our Dot Com moment. 

Adj for inflation, thats an overall total market mc of approx 10tn. 

BTC/ETH historically take 50% so that leaves 50% or 5tn for alts.   

This means the top 20 will range from mid 10s of bil to low 100s of bil. 

And with all the reasons I laid out above, its a no brainer to me that MOG will be at the top of this list.

Think about it, DOGE went to 88bn when the overall mc ceiling was just above 3tn.

If we get to the heights of 10tn, the top meme mcaps can double or triple DOGE's prev 88bn ceiling.

Most of are you in disbelief and won't believe what I'm saying despite the reasons laid out. 

But just look at where we are in the market cycle, BTC is literally consolidating at ATHs. Once we break out, which is imminent, that is when the REAL meme/ alt run starts.

This is where we get 6 - 12 months of PURE exuberance and outperformance. This is where targets like 100bn become a given.

And look at where MOG is in comparison to the other major memes. It has a DRASTIC discount that will be eaten up BEFORE the real run starts.

You cannot sit there with a straight face and tell me that the objectively strongest meme is at 400m mc when the others are well over 2bn.

- DOGE 25bn
- SHIB 17bn
- PEPE 3.5bn
- WIF 2.9bn
- FLOKI 2.5bn
- BONK 1.6bn

- MOG 600m 

The market will drastically reprice MOG upwards.

Cherry on top, MOG is available on the 2 chains with literally the MOST MONEY and is being actively listed on all exchanges for the normies (crypto dot com is a sleeper btw, see attached tweet below).

There are many more reasons as to why MOG is so poised to dominate everything else this cycle but this post is already long enough.

Conclusion

Fk all of your targets, they are still way too god damn low.

We are going so much higher you have no fking idea.

Literally put all of what I've said together and try telling me with a straight face that MOG is not the top meme.

Read line 6.

So much higher. 🫵😹"

Despite this, its value remains above $103,000 on Tuesday (21), and the long-term outlook remains optimistic.

On the other hand, Solana (SOL) recorded the biggest drop among major cryptocurrencies, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE), with losses of 8.8% and 8.5%, respectively. As for memecoins, the day did not start well for those linked to the Trump couple. The TRUMP memecoin fell by 26% to $36, while MELANIA suffered an even steeper drop of 56%, reaching a price of $4.58.

As a result, MELANIA dropped to 15th place in the ranking of memecoins by market capitalization, while TRUMP managed to hold on to third place, behind only Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, in the overall ranking, both fell outside the Top 100.

The market remains optimistic about the next Bitcoin bull run. According to one analyst, the cryptocurrency is “halfway” to reaching its all-time high in this cycle.

# Facts about the Bitcoin halving

The current Bitcoin model is based on its halving cycle, which halves the issuance of new BTC and generates a supply shock. According to analyst Ted Boydston, this cycle consists of four stages that explain the process of price increase.

The first stage, known as accumulation, marks the bottom of the market and is followed by the beginning of the bull market. This phase began shortly after the US presidential election and concluded with the first half of the cycle.

Next comes the consolidation phase, which likely occurred when Bitcoin struggled to stay above $100,000. Finally, the final bullish rally occurs, where BTC rises exponentially to set a new all-time high.

https://preview.redd.it/a5qs9y9urcee1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5d73b1b2c69e65f1616533806433e83414d804

This model compares the halvings of 2012, 2016, and 2020 to the current market. Boydston highlights historical similarities and trends, and estimates that Bitcoin could peak at $380,000 in this cycle. However, he cautions that this model is based on historical data and does not guarantee future results.

# What does this mean?

Bitcoin is currently trading at $103,010 after a slight correction, accumulating a drop of 4.8%. This correction occurred after Donald Trump's inauguration and could stabilize over time.

Despite the drop, the long-term outlook remains positive. According to the BTC price model, the current cycle is in its maturation phase, approaching its euphoric peak, where cycle highs are historically reached.

Overall, the model suggests that the price will continue its upward trend, testing higher standard deviation levels. Based on historical trends, BTC's peak could come in late 2025, reaching values ​​close to $300,000 or more.

>“Market manipulators, known as ‘stop loss hunters,’ triggered a long squeeze, resulting in significant volatility. The price oscillated around $7,000 in 15-minute intervals, highlighting the instability. In the coming days, volatility could remain high, with support at $100,000 and psychological resistance at $110,000,” commented Rafael Bonventi, analyst at Bitget.

I already knew about Ragnar's death and that the series would get worse later, but I watched it anyway. And I simply LOVED this series, it was one of the best experiences I've ever had with a series. Even though I knew about Ragnar's death, I was shocked by his outcome; It is, for me, the best conclusion for a protagonist.  



So, I went to the next episode, and I already miss Ragnar in less than one episode, because Crossings was horrible, in my opinion. It's not because the previous episode was the best or because I'm being annoying about not having Ragnar, but I really hated the writing in this episode.  



My main dislike is Rollo. Why did they ruin the character so much in just one episode? I found his arc fantastic. He changed A LOT. In season one, he was just a generic Viking who killed, raped, and screamed for no reason, but after he betrayed Ragnar for the first time in season two, he started to change a little. He went through a journey and stopped raping or just killing without purpose.  



However, he really changed after Siggy's death. He felt very empty and discovered that no one really cared about him. The only one who REALLY helped him was Bjorn, but Ragnar didn't care. After that arc, sunk into depression, he really changed. Then he betrayed Ragnar again, which in my opinion was the right decision as he would be much happier in France. His arc in France was really fun, becoming that man who saved Paris from the Vikings. For me, this arc was perfect, and I don't think they needed to show more of it, but that's okay. He came back. I didn't think I would go with them, but he came back.  



And... ok, so after ALL that, he's back to being a generic Viking who rapes and screams gibberish. 

Oh wow, Bjorn is also a rapist now, apparently. Literally, he was raised by Ragnar, and neither of them had been shown to be rapists, but Bjorn became one. This whole invasion didn't even make sense. They talk at sea about whether people in the region will think they are enemies, BUT OF COURSE THEY WILL THINK THAT! YOU ARE INVADING AND KILLING EVERYONE!  



I may be exaggerating, I know they are Vikings and that violence and aggression are part of them, but it's not the same without Ragnar. Not to mention how BORING his kids are, except for Bjorn and Ivar. I hope they improve Bjorn, because he still looks like a generic Viking, but Ivar... you're the GOAT!  

I hope the other children become more interesting, because I'm afraid the series will lose this protagonist issue, like what happened with The Walking Dead. Don't get me wrong, I like Lagertha, but not as much as the community usually does. I think it... I don't know how to explain it, very forced. I'm just not that big of a fan of hers.

I hope the series doesn't fall into a protagonist vacuum, anyway Floki, Egberto and Ivar, I'm in it for you, for me these are the best characters after Ragnar and Athelstan
