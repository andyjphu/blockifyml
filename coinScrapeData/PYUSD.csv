"Help with self employment earnings in USD, converting to AUD-GBP",UKPersonalFinance,1i9uu86,2025-01-25 14:28:45,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1i9uu86/help_with_self_employment_earnings_in_usd/,LunaaBby,,"Hello! I’ve started earning money through self employment while I’m in the UK, my earnings are deposited into my Australian PayPal account in USD.
I’m confused about how I should be obtaining the money and am hoping for some clarification on best practice, tax implications, and/or who I should talk to about it.

Since my PayPal account is in AUD I have been transferring my earnings out of my PayPal (which auto converts my earnings to AUD) to my Australian account, and converting the money to GBP in my Wise account.
I also have a USD wise account and am able to transfer my earnings from PayPal in USD to my USD wise account and then convert the money from USD to GBP.

I’ve been keeping track of the amounts I’m earning in USD and the conversion from AUD to GBP.
With tax in mind, I’ve been keeping 20% aside in AUD, by calculating 20% of the total earnings in USD, and converting it to AUD. 

I’m assuming I’ll need to log the earnings with HMRC, but do I need to do anything with the ATO (Aus Tax Office) since the cash is going through my AUD accounts? Should I be talking to a tax advisor in the UK or Aus? 

Thanks in advance :)"

You have received a sum of $30.00 USD from ()

But we have a problem crediting your account because () sent the money from a Business Account.

Your Account isn’t a Business Account which makes us put this transaction on hold, as the sender sent the money from a Business Account, so we won’t be able to release this payment into your Account.


This will make us hold the payment until you get credited by () with an additional $30.00 USD then you can receive the pending payment.

This won’t be visible to you on your PayPal Application, as you haven’t followed the requested instructions.

This is happening because you got credited from an upgraded Business Account user.

We won’t be able to credit your account until this account limit has been expanded and upgraded to a Business Account.

We will put you through some steps you need to carry out before you can solve this.

() is expected to send an additional payment of $30.00 USD to your account, then you can get upgraded.

Sending you an Additional amount will make us Upgrade your Account to a Business Account, as this will show that you are trusted by a Business Account by sending for the second time, then your Account will get upgraded.

The total sum of $60.00USD will be credited to your account after they upgrade is done 
An alert has been sent to ()
also as regards to the additional payment the sender have to make to your account.

The person offered to pay the extra 30$ as ling as i payed them back. but right now my account is still new so whatever transaction i get will put into money on hold until 21 days. What do i do. I saw that many people said this is a scam. But whos the scammer? i dont think its the person who is commissioning me. The gmail that sent this money is so suspicious.

The expected ship date was maybe March of 2024. The artist posted an updated on Feb of 2024 that there was an issue with the head backs and those needed to get redone. So I waited until July 2023 to reach out for an update was told they were still working on sending out a previous pre-order and they would ship out the doll I ordered in the next month or so. 
I understood let it go and waited. I followed their social accounts to look for updates and nothing, the artist has had different projects they have been working on and posted about them so in October 2023 I reached out again. Explaining they have a chronic illness and they can’t move as fast to get things out and they were working on getting dolls sent out. 
I understood and waited searching for updates and communication of the situation but nothing. And I’m out 485 usd I tried disputing it with PayPal but they told me I’m out of the purchased protection.  I really wanted the doll and I feel like a fool for being so kind and patient. "

Up for offer is a Montblanc Great Masters Pirelli with an incredibly smooth and forgiving bold italic grind.

I'm asking $3500 AUD (~$2200 USD) via PayPal Goods and Services, inclusive of shipping fully insured globally (I am based in Australia but am happy to ship). I am somewhat open to offers/partial trades, mostly for Nakayas or Montblanc 146-esque models.

Perfect condition externally, no scratches, dents or chipping of ruthenium plating - it has been inked with Montblanc inks only. The italic grind is very forgiving yet still provides very attractive line variation. It will come with all the original boxes and paperwork.

Pirelli rubber body, ruthenium coated accents, mother of pearl cap emblem, a very unique, well built yet functional writing instrument. 

From the Montblanc website: https://www.montblanc.com/en-us/fountain-pens_cod27086482324028509.html

Happy to provide more photos, writing samples, videos etc, just ask!

I'm looking to sell some photocards. I am US based and would prefer to only sell to those in the US as well (but please reach out if you're an international person who's interested). I accept payments through PayPal F&F or G&S (if you choose G&S, I will need you to cover the fees). Domestic US shipping for all orders starts at $6 USD.

For the first image, all PCs are $2. However, you must purchase at least 4 cards (minimum total $8 USD before shipping) so I can save on packaging supplies. If you'd like to purchase all of the remaining cards in the first image, I will sell it to you for $25 USD! Priority goes to those who claim more \^\_\^

For the second image (POBs), I have included price breakdowns below! Orders placed for singular cards will be considered, but I will prioritize those who claim multiple.

Price Breakdown:

Giveaway Time!,Paypal_Donations,1i97gy2,2025-01-24 17:09:30,8,0.84,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paypal_Donations/comments/1i97gy2/giveaway_time/,Cynnau,,"**Copy and pasted from my original post because I am too lazy to retype a lot of things.**

Some of you may have seen me in other subreddits doing crazy shit like this, and since this one is a new one, I thought let's do a giveaway!

I would like to give $25 to one or more people to celebrate 1,000 members!  Also because the mods here were accused of wanting donations all for ourselves, even though none of us have ever asked for anything, and we donate to others when we can.  Some people are just pathetic.  Anywho, this is $25 USD so based on your local currency it might be more or less. This is ONLY for PayPal this time, so others can get in on this.

Do I have any requirements? Yes, whatever the rules are in the subreddit are the requirements (I will also go through post history and the archive so no hiding shit!). I am not going to pick somebody that I personally have helped recently (THOUGH I might change my mind on that one). I do not need a sob story, I do not need to know that this would be such a blessing because if you're asking for help it would obviously be a blessing, so if I see the word blessing in your reply, I am ignoring you haha.

I would like to know what it is for, and I NEED to know the weather outside.  Is it raining?  Sunny?  Tell me! 

It goes without saying that if any of you message me privately, not only will I drag you through DM, I will report you to the mods, and I have a long memory. Is that kind of bitchy of me? Absofuckinglutely, but deal with it haha.

It is currently 2:08 pm Pacific Standard Time, and I will close this offer tomorrow January 25th when I wake up and get moving, most likely around 8:00 am PST. I will then go through everything and pick someone at that time, unless work is being a pain, it might take some time to get through everything..at the very least I will pick someone(s) at the end of the day for me, so like 3:00 pm PST. I have a team of trusted advisors that will assist me in choosing the person or persons, just as an FYI.

EDIT: Guys I can't believe I have to say this but do not send me a private message. Not only is it against the rules in the subreddit, not only is it stated here in this post, my profile literally says please do not message me unless I ask you to. Seriously the ones who are doing it are just outing themselves as a red flag and a scammer so stop. - I AM KEEPING THIS NOTE SINCE THE LAST TIME I DID ONE OF THESE PEOPLE STILL MESSAGED. JUST. DO. NOT. DO. IT."

Now, the city is a dismal urban wasteland contaminated by otherworldly magic and haunted by hideous monsters. Fantastic wealth, lost knowledge, and powerful artifacts lie ready for the taking by adventurers brave or foolish enough to venture into the ruins! Check out the cinematic trailer to get a vibe for the atmosphere: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wnGvCvIkq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wnGvCvIkq8)



What to Expect:

loration as you discover adventure sites that run the gamut from seedy back alleys where the real business of the city is done to the mysterious overgrown garden of the former queen to the wondrous gothic cathedral of the patron saint of the city and even a magical stronghold lost to it's former inhabitants who will do anything to get it back.

\-Social interactions and faction intrigue with important figures who are barely holding their own in the city. You as the players will make the difference and tip the scale in the favor of those seeking to restore order or those who revel in the chaos of the ruins.

\-Ferocious combat encounters with predatory beasts, mutated monstrosities, and terrifying aberrations caused by the mysterious meteor shower that destroyed the city, not to mention it's more human inhabitants who all have their own agenda.



This is an adventure that will take characters from 1st to 13th level.

Character creation will be done together to create a tight party with characters who fit the tone and setting of the adventure.

We will be using the 2024 ruleset, and I reserve the right as the DM to make any changes, adjustments, and rulings regarding things both RAW and RAI.

This is a dark fantasy setting, but be aware that I tend to run it a little more hopeful than grim.

We will be using Roll20 for the vtt + Discord for voice chat.
