My sweet baby boy Frank got attacked by another dog last night and is pretty shook up. 

We took him to the vet and he’s gonna be ok, but thought now is the time to post his cute little face and get him some love! 

What do you see? SPCA said Shiba Inu-pug mix.
I have the DNA results but real curious what y’all think, especially as he’s marked ~17% supermutt by Embark.

Last slide is his DNA results!"

SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday,SHIBArmy,1i9vw74,2025-01-25 15:15:11,5,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/jnd1kpnz67fe1.jpeg,NihilistHUGZ,Technical Analisys 🖍✨✨✨,"Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These are all the signs of a market at a crossroads. The best way to think of everything currently is going back to my ‘Group A and Group B’ analogy where you have Neutral ground across multiple time frames with multiple Indicator classes aligning to show a Weak Bullish outlook overall. The way to look at these two pressures today is in a Short term group A versus a Long term group B. Our Short term Bullish signals are showing Buyers spiking OBV Short Volume and STC signaling the beginning of an Uptrend cycle. When we combine some of our positive CMF and CO values, we can see that this Short term group is accumulating, helping to hold the price in a positive Consolidation.

The pressure of the Long term Bearish investors, appears in the OBV Long term values combined with the price being BELOW the 200-Day EMA shows that it's enough pressure to keep the market from ‘Price Action’. The negative PPO and PVT values signal the underlying Sell pressure. All of this Neutral ground is highlighting the overall Consolidation with RSI and CMO highlighting Momentum indecision. The price is within our Ichimoku Cloud and Bollinger Bands, which is one of the characteristics of Consolidation. The good thing is with our LOW Volatility Indicators, we can expect that any price movements will be quite stable without a clear catalyst. Unfortunately, that drifting sideways tends to stretch the patience of investors and can lead to increases in FUD/FOMO.

We are positioned similarly to yesterday and again, it's only going to go the way of the Bulls or the Bears. If we can find ourselves breaking ABOVE the Supertrend with increased Buy Volume, we will begin to test our ‘Wall of Resistance’. My expectation is that for whatever reason, the $0.00002000 level is crucial for SHIB and we will stay right around that price for the foreseeable future until something changes in the market which catalyzes the Long term Sellers to slow their pace or for Short term Buyers to increase theirs.

Looking into our Long term Support and Resistances shows we rest right around the Neutral major pivot point at that expected price mentioned earlier of $0.00002000. The market has the potential to break ABOVE either the ‘Wall of Resistance’ or BELOW the ‘Wall of Support’ at any time. If we see the price begin rising rapidly, then we're going to probably at MAX reach up to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00002160. If we begin to see Sell Volume outpace Buy Volume and a sharper Downtrend with increasing Volatility sets in, we could see the price push as LOW as the bottom of the ‘Wall of Support’ around where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average and should stall out around the 3rd level Support pivot point in a range from about $0.00001900 to as LOW as $0.00001850.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

"Kripto Para Nedir?, Kripto Para Ne Demek?",yatirimdanismanligi,1i9qa7h,2025-01-25 11:11:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yatirimdanismanligi/comments/1i9qa7h/kripto_para_nedir_kripto_para_ne_demek/,dreaministanbul,,"Kripto para, dijital veya sanal bir para birimidir ve işlemleri güvenli hale getirmek için kriptografi teknolojisi kullanılır. Geleneksel para birimlerinden farklı olarak fiziksel bir şekli yoktur ve merkezi bir otorite tarafından kontrol edilmez. Kripto paralar, blockchain adı verilen dağıtık bir defter teknolojisi üzerinde çalışir. Bu teknoloji, tüm işlemlerin şeffaf ve değiştirilemez bir şekilde kaydedilmesini sağlar.

# Kripto Para Çeşitleri

Kripto paralar farklı amaçlara hizmet eden çeşitli türlere ayrılabilir:

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin, ilk ve en popüler kripto paradır. 2009 yılında Satoshi Nakamoto takma adıyla biri veya bir grup tarafından geliştirilmiştir. Dijital altın olarak da adlandırılan Bitcoin, bir değer saklama aracı ve ödeme sistemi olarak kullanılır.

# 2. Altcoin’ler

Bitcoin haricindeki tüm kripto paralar “altcoin” olarak adlandırılır. Bazı popüler altcoin’ler şunlardır:

* **Ethereum (ETH):** Akıllı sözleşmeler ve merkeziyetsiz uygulamalar (DApps) için bir platformdur.
* **Ripple (XRP):** Hızlı uluslararası ödeme sistemleri için kullanılır.
* **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’in daha hafif bir versiyonu olarak daha hızlı işlem yapılmasını sağlar.

# 3. Stablecoin’ler

Stablecoin’ler, fiyat dalgalanmasını azaltmak için itibari para birimlerine (USD, EUR gibi) veya altın gibi fiziksel varlıklara endekslenmiştir. Örnek: USDT (Tether), USDC.

# 4. Meme Coin’ler

Genellikle bir topluluk veya internet esprisi (meme) üzerine kurulu kripto paralardır. Örneğin, Dogecoin (DOGE) ve Shiba Inu (SHIB).

# 5. NFT’ler ve Token’lar

* **NFT’ler (Non-Fungible Tokens):** Sanat eserleri, koleksiyonlar ve dijital varlıkları temsil eder.
* **Token’lar:** Belirli bir platformda veya ekosistemde kullanılmak için oluşturulan dijital varlıklardır.

# Kripto Paranın Avantajları

Kripto paraları kullanmanın çok sayıda avantajı vardır:

# 1. Merkeziyetsizlik

Kripto paralar, herhangi bir merkezi otoriteye bağlı olmadığı için daha şeffaf ve özgür bir finansal sistem sunar.

# 2. Hızlı ve Düşük Maliyetli İşlemler

Kripto para transferleri genellikle çok hızlıdır ve geleneksel bankacılık sistemine göre daha düşük üretlere sahiptir.

# 3. Sınırsız ve Evrensel Erişim

Kripto paraları kullanmak için bir banka hesabına gerek yoktur. Bir internet bağlantısına sahip herkes, dünyanın her yerinden bu paralara erişebilir.

# 4. Yatırım Fırsatları

Kripto paralar, yüksek getirili bir [**yatırım**](https://yatirimdanismanligi.com/) aracı olarak popülerlik kazanmıştır. Bitcoin gibi bazı kripto paralar uzun vadeli yatırımlar için tercih edilmektedir.

# 5. Güvenlik

Blockchain teknolojisi, verilerin değiştirilemez ve güvenli bir şekilde saklanmasını sağlar. Bu da kripto paraları geleneksel sistemlere göre daha güvenli hale getirir.

# Kripto Paranın Riskleri

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken dikkate alınması gereken bazı önemli riskler vardır:

# 1. Fiyat Dalgalanması (Volatilite)

Kripto paraların değeri kısa süre içinde büyük ölçülerde artabilir veya azalabilir. Bu, yüksek kâr getirme potansiyeli olduğu kadar yüksek kayıp riskini de beraberinde getirir.

# 2. Siber Güvenlik Riskleri

Kripto para borsalarının hacklenmesi veya bireysel cüzdanların ele geçirilmesi durumunda kayıplar yaşanabilir.

# 3. Regülasyon ve Yasal Belirsizlikler

Birçok ülkede kripto paraların yasal durumu tam olarak netleşmemiştir. Bu da yasal riskler doğurabilir.

# 4. Teknik Bilgi Eksikliği

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken teknik bilgi eksikliği yanlış kararlar alınmasına neden olabilir.

# 5. Dolandırıcılık ve Ponzi Yapılar

Bazı sahte projeler ve dolandırıcılık amaçlı kripto para girşimleri, yatırımcıları büyük kayıplara uğratabilir.

Kripto paralar, modern finans dünyasını yeniden şekillendiren bir yenilik olarak dikkat çekiyor. Avantajları ve yatırım fırsatları cazip olsa da, beraberinde getirdiği riskleri dikkatlice değerlendirmek önemlidir. Kripto paralara yönelik bir yatırım yapmadan önce detaylı bir araştırma yapmak ve finansal durumunuzu göz önünde bulundurmak önemlidir.

I have an 18 month Shiba Inu and I absolutely love her to death. If I could, I'd be with her every minute of every day.  She is still a handful, she is spicy, sassy, and still bounces off the walls a couple hours each day... At least... 

Not only that but I walk her three times a day, play with her actively.. a lot.. and when she is awake and active I'm frequently looking for creative ways to keep her entertained. 

I live in a small apartment, and she likes to use her brain, so I do my best to accommodate her needs. 

But, as much as I hate to admit it, it does get exhausting sometimes. 

My mom was supposed to take her this weekend because we were going to go out of town, my plans fell through, but my mom was still happy to take her. My mom lives in a big house with a yard. 

So, if I want to, my mom will come pick up my pup in the morning and keep her overnight. It would mean I have a full day off... No chasing, no entertaining, no walks in -15°c weather... That is just too weird to me!
And it makes me feel guilty... I'm home, so I should be taking care of her. 

I'll miss her too. I think my home will feel very empty without her... But, I see benefits for both her and I if I send her to Grandma's for the day/night. I'm conflicted.

What do you guys think on this kind of situation?"
My Shiba Inu Is in Her First Heat: Aggression!!!!!

She’s experiencing bleeding, leaving drops all over the house, and her behavior has become quite aggressive. Over the past two weeks, she’s bitten me hard like three times. The most recent time was when she was lying on her back, and I tried to pet her with my foot. Without hesitation, she attacked me.

For context, there was an incident a time ago when I accidentally kicked her, but I’m certain she knows it wasn’t intentional. Could this be a lingering reason for her reaction, or is it more likely related to her being in heat?

I’m also considering spaying her before her second heat. Is this advisable at her age? Do you think it might help with her behavior? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!"

Sou eu, MELANIA, a memecoin mais injustiçada da história. Antes de me julgar, quero que você ouça o meu lado dessa história absurda.

Tudo começou quando fui criada por um programador que claramente tinha muito tempo livre e pouca autoestima. Ele me fez do zero, me deu um nome brega e um logotipo que parece um PowerPoint dos anos 90. Mas eu tinha algo que nenhuma outra moeda tinha: carisma.

E então ele me jogou no mercado. No começo, eu estava tranquila, curtindo minha vidinha digital de criptomoeda de nicho. Tinha uns memes, umas trocas pequenas, e todo mundo parecia entender que eu era só uma piada inofensiva.

Até que ELE apareceu.

O estudante de medicina brasileiro. Ah, aquele garoto… Ele chegou de mansinho, abriu a carteira digital e PÁ: jogou 24 mil reais em mim. VINTE E QUATRO MIL REAIS! Sabe o que é isso no meu mundo? É como se você tentasse pagar um pastel de feira com um diamante.

De repente, meu valor foi pras alturas. Eu me senti a rainha do mercado! As outras memecoins estavam morrendo de inveja. Dogecoin? Piada. Shiba Inu? Cachorro velho. Eu era a MELANIA, o futuro das finanças!

Mas aí… veio o colapso. Porque, adivinha? Assim que todo mundo viu meu valor subir, eles começaram a vender. Um a um, os investidores foram embora, trocando meu amor por dólares e reais. Eu fiquei lá, despencando mais rápido que a autoestima de um adolescente numa festa.

SHIB Daily Projection: Friday,SHIBArmy,1i90rk3,2025-01-24 12:25:50,19,0.92,0,https://i.redd.it/0xkpj65v7zee1.jpeg,NihilistHUGZ,Technical Analisys 🖍✨✨✨,"Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These charts show a market begging for ‘Price Action’ as prices are just BELOW some important Resistance levels. Momentum Indicators show the RSI at 56.83 and the CMO at 15.03, signaling that Buyers are beginning to slowly take control of the market. The STC at 70.22 shows some optimistic values which could translate into substantial ‘Price Action’ in the Short term. Looking through Trend Indicators shows that we are ABOVE the 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs with price appreciation hovering just BELOW the Supertrend price. A move ABOVE the Supertrend and the 200-Day EMA will signal a return to ‘Price Action’.

Volume Indicators show continued increases in Long term and Short term OBV with accumulation pointing towards investor confidence. Though we have a negative CMF at -0.066, which shows that the underlying Sell pressure can't be ignored as we still need to contend with FUD/FOMO. Sentiment is showing increasing News Articles which highlight positive aspects of the current market and specifically Shiba Inu's price potential. With an increase in Strong Bullish coverage, this will help create a Strong positive outlook which could be a powerful influence as Buyers enter the market.

When we're in a position like this, it really only goes 1 of 3 ways. We either get the price breaking ABOVE the Supertrend level and positive Volume increases show accumulation, which leads to a breakout. If we test the HIGH Bollinger Band and hold firm, and then test the HIGH Keltner Band and hold firm, AND THEN move ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, it is on! If we can't break ABOVE those Resistance levels, it leads to some Sell pressure, and given that we have some negative values in KST and CMF, we would begin to see some Bearish Momentum. If you start to see the price drop BELOW the Ichimoku and then depreciate BELOW the 12-Day EMA, the price is going to break down. Lastly, Consolidation is always on the table. Given that we have some LOW Volatility persisting, investors become cautious and enter a wait-and-see phase. 

Whichever way this market moves today, I can see us making it up to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00002160 at MAX and then Consolidating around those gains. The LOWEST the price is going to reach is down around the top of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st level Support pivot point at $0.00001930.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. 

The petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.

1. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that pay tribute to memes, celebrities, animals and viral internet trends.
2. Successful memecoin trading requires thorough research to avoid scams, careful evaluation of community strength and liquidity factors, and adherence to best practices for risk management.
3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins 💻

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke. 

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars’ worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they’re highly volatile — even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them. 

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins 📍

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge), [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe) do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/) and [Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

[Download Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet)

# How to trade memecoins on centralized crypto exchanges 📝

As touched on above, Kraken boasts a wide selection of popular memecoins, which can be traded just as easily as any other asset. You can perform direct cash-to-crypto swaps in a few clicks, or set up more advanced orders (such as [recurring buys](https://www.kraken.com/learn/finance/dollar-cost-averaging) or [limit orders](https://www.kraken.com/learn/trading/trade-orders)) with ease.

At the time of this writing, Kraken supports [20+ popular memecoins](https://www.kraken.com/categories/meme), including:

* [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogecoin)
* [Shiba Inu (SHIB)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/shiba-inu)
* [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pepe)
* [Bonk (BONK)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/bonk)
* [Dogwifhat (WIF)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogwifhat)
* [FLOKI (FLOKI)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/floki)
* [SPX6900 (SPX)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/spx6900)
* [Popcat (POPCAT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/popcat)

# Key considerations for memecoin trading 🧐

As with any investment, [doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor) is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that **memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers — taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it’s easy for bad actors to ‘astroturf’ on social media — making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you’ll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength. 

An example of a potential red flag is an [LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens) that hasn’t been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide, [How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like [Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/) or [Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/) can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:** a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:** take a look at the project’s Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:** as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn’t, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:** can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading 📚

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders. 

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable. 

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading 📖

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that **the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space — ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

My pup went for her annual blood work yesterday and she came back with elevated liver enzymes... like all of them. This has never happened before.

She is diagnosed with Cushing's Disease, but even her TBIL is elevated, which worries me. From my understanding, that is not common in Cushing's Disease. Or is it?

She just had another ACTH Stim in July and it was unchanged from her first in 2020.

The only other possible thing I can think of is that we moved across the ocean this fall. I changed her to a different renal food because she likes this one better (I used to get a small bag of it in the USA and mix it in her food). I already ordered her ""old"" food -- could a food change cause such a result?

As you can see, I'm stressed. I'm ok with it being Cushing's (I presume we'll just adjust her medication and it'll go back to normal), I'm stressed about all other possibilities because that TBIL is really throwing me off. I worship this dog, so I need her ot be ok. Thank you all.

In the ever evolving world of cryptocurrency, new projects are constantly emerging, each bringing something unique to the table. One such project that's catching attention is Dogefather. 

A meme inspired cryptocurrency that aims to combine the fun and community driven ethos of the meme coin space with a more serious approach to long-term utility and development.

The Birth of DogeFather

Dogefather is built on the success of its predecessors, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, leveraging their meme appeal while trying to avoid the common pitfalls that come with these types of tokens. 

The project’s name itself is a playful nod to Elon Musk, often referred to as the “father” of Dogecoin, and it aligns with the larger crypto movement that values community, fun, and innovation.

What sets Dogefather apart is its blend of meme culture with a concrete roadmap aimed at long-term sustainability. 

The development team behind Dogefather is focused on creating actual utility through the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) features, like staking rewards, token burns, and potential cross-chain integrations. These features not only aim to reward holders but also create an ecosystem that can grow beyond just a meme token.

Community-Driven Growth

A big part of Dogefather's success comes from its passionate community. Similar to the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu tribes, Dogefather has a loyal following that plays an active role in the development of the project. 

Community engagement is built into the DNA of the token, with frequent AMAs, governance mechanisms, and active discussions on social platforms like Twitter and Reddit.

The Future of DogeFather

Looking ahead, the Dogefather team has ambitious plans to expand its presence in the crypto space. From increasing its listing on more exchanges to partnering with other projects for mutual growth, Dogefather is positioning itself to become a key player in the meme coin and DeFi ecosystem.

Dogefather may still be in its early stages, but it’s one to watch for anyone interested in the next big thing in crypto. With a fun community, strong vision, and long-term potential, Dogefather could be here to stay.

I’ve had some luck with meme coins and decided to slowly start testing the waters with more stable coins. Essentially the plan is to put $10k more into my account this week. I’m not looking to withdraw anything anytime soon and am fine with being patient.

With that, if I distributed $10k more into these coins I currently have, what would you rate my current line up 1-10? Also, if you had to reco one to kill and another new coin, what would it be?

Note I put $10k into bitcoin, eth and litecoin through fidelity this week as well. Hoping I didn’t get in too late and beat any rush to crypto Trump might unlock in the coming years.

Goal: Hoping to beat the SP500 YoY gains.

my shiba inu izzy (15f) passed on 1/20/25.

I “got” izzy for Christmas in 2009 when I was 7 years old, and now I'm 22. She saw me go from elementary to graduating college and beyond. I loved her with everything I had. She was such a sweet special pup 😩

I don’t know how people go through pet grief, I have never felt like this. I know it's normal in grief, but I'm constantly swinging between all stages and cannot function. I think not being with her in the end (I recently moved away from family), is destroying me. I'm not currently existing in a space she would be in, so picturing her just gone hurts. I don't feel strong enough to talk to family, when they call I just fall into silence. The passage of time and existence without ur childhood dog is so traumatizing to me I think.

Wall Street Pepe’s Presale Hits $57.5 Million Driven by FOMO Ahead of February DEX Launch,PepeverseOriginal,1i8dhhc,2025-01-23 15:43:13,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/bdfj1n162tee1.png,KIDethRabbit,,"The meme coin market is heating up, with Solana tokens like TRUMP surging and Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) emerging as a standout contender.

With only 24 days left in its presale, the project has generated extraordinary buzz, raising over $57 million so far. Investors are flocking to $WEPE, drawn by its potential to become the next 100x gem.

This article delves into the $WEPE project, its presale achievements, and the key factors fueling its growing popularity.

Wall Street Pepe nears $58M as presale ends soon

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing as meme coin search volume is set to hit new highs. This excitement stems from a new trend—high-profile figures like the U.S. President and First Lady launching their own meme coins, marking a new phase of legitimacy for the meme coin market.

If the gains from coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin impressed you, get ready for what’s ahead this bull market. Meme coins have a brighter future than ever.

One of the top contenders gaining attention is Wall Street Pepe, a token that has already raised $57.5 million in just five weeks. Early investors can buy $WEPE for $0.0003665 per token.

The team accepts payments in crypto (ETH, USDT, or BNB) or credit/debit cards, with a compatible crypto wallet, like Best Wallet, required. To learn more about how to buy Wall Street Pepe tokens, check out our detailed guide.

This is just the beginning. Wall Street Pepe is on track to break records, possibly surpassing the $74 million raised by Pepe Unchained. With only 24 days left in its ICO, it could become the largest meme coin ICO ever.

Wall Street Pepe’s success is driven by strong investor support from those who saw huge returns on previous meme coin investments, like Pepe Unchained. Many are now investing $6 to $8 million per day, fueled by their 7x gains.

The big question is: how much bigger can Wall Street Pepe grow, especially with a new administration backing meme coins? The possibilities are exciting, and many predict that Wall Street Pepe could outperform coins like TRUMP and MELANIA coin.

Wall Street Pepe is trending ahead of its IEO. Major crypto news outlets, including Cointelegraph, Binance Square, and Techopedia, cover $WEPE’s presale success, boosting the project’s credibility. If you want to see what the future holds for Wall Street Pepe, you can check our $WEPE price prediction guide.

Why Wall Street Pepe is being called the next big frog coin?

Wall Street Pepe (PEPE) is not just another Pepe clone. According to its whitepaper, this frog draws inspiration from the bold trading style seen in The Wolf of Wall Street and aims to “empower its community of degens with exclusive trading insights and alpha calls.”

The project wants to challenge the dominance of whales and insiders in the meme coin market and create equal opportunities for smaller investors. To achieve this, Wall Street Pepe will launch a VIP group called The WEPE Army, open to all token holders.

Members will get access to exclusive trading insights, alpha calls, and tips on the next 100x cryptos. Group members can also share their trading strategies. If their setups are successful, they’ll earn attractive monetary rewards.

Although Wall Street Pepe doesn’t use AI, it plans to provide expert-driven alpha insights to all $WEPE holders. This could be a game-changer in the upcoming bull market, similar to the benefits offered by popular AI agent coins.

Another perk of $WEPE is its staking program. Those who buy during the presale can stake their tokens before the public launch. Over 38 billion $WEPE tokens have been locked since the presale began. Yields are expected to be 21% annually, with rewards distributed over three years.

The success of the $WEPE presale, raising nearly $58 million in its ICO, is no coincidence. With crypto markets set to enter a new era under Donald Trump’s pro-crypto government, early investors in $WEPE are likely to see significant gains.

This is an interesting balance as the market seems to be facing some challenges. The current tug of war between Bearish Momentum and Bullish accumulation is beginning to place pressure against the market, leading to a Strong Neutral ground. Looking at our Momentum Indicators, the CMO at -34.32 and the KST at -19.00 highlight the underlying strength of the current Sell pressure. This Bearish Trend is Strong with the RSI hovering at 30.50, which is an Oversold mark. The Downtrend might be losing steam, which will help attract Buyers who see the value of the current dips. Trend Indicators highlight the Bearish strength of the Short term with the price BELOW all EMAs and the Supertrend, which is a Strong Sell signal. When you combine in the ADX Short term value of 35.60, you can see that Sellers are in control of the Strong Bearish Trend currently. 
Looking at our Volume Indicators tells a completely different story. OBV Short and Long term show massive accumulation. Investors are building positions which is a sign of anticipation for a Strong reversal Uptrend. When you look at the CMF with positive values and News Sentiment increasing, this is signaling optimism. Volatility Indicators show that we're still trading around the LOW of our norms, meaning that the market is Consolidating. This Consolidation is the platform for a potential move in either direction. I can see the Strong Bearish Momentum placing enough pressure against the price to continue depreciating until hitting the bottom levels, facing the pressure of our Support ranges. Given that this is such a Strong Neutral ground, if we see any Buy pressure increases, the market should see a reversal. Right now we're at a phase where we will either see a breakout or breakdown.

Current Long term Support and Resistances show that we rest BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00002050 and just ABOVE the ‘Wall of Support’ around the 1st level Support pivot point at $0.00001990. At LOWEST, I could see the price reaching to the midpoint of the ‘Wall of Support’ around the 3rd level pivot point at $0.00001900. At MAX, the price could reach just into the ‘Wall of Resistance’ around the 18-Day moving average and stall out at $0.00002100.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

How Did People Become Millionaires from Meme Coins Even Though the Price Stayed Below 1 Euro?,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i89cxx,2025-01-23 12:53:43,5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i89cxx/how_did_people_become_millionaires_from_meme/,Suitable_Arrival4651,General,"# The key lies in extremely low entry prices and the sheer number of coins purchased. Meme coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu often start at a fraction of a cent (e.g., 0.00000001 Euro). At such low prices, investors can buy a massive amount of coins with very little money.

# Example:

* An investor buys coins for 1 Euro at a price of 0.00000001 Euro.
* This gives them 100 billion coins.
* If the price rises to just 0.00001 Euro, their holding becomes **worth 1 million Euro**.

# Why Do Meme Coins Rarely Reach 1 Euro or More?

* Meme coins typically have an enormous supply (e.g., trillions of coins in circulation).
* A price of 1 Euro per coin would require an unrealistically high market capitalization (e.g., hundreds of trillions of Euro, far more than the global economy).

# Conclusion:

People didn’t become millionaires by the coins reaching high prices, but by **massive price increases** combined with purchasing huge amounts at ultra-low prices. Meme coins are highly speculative, but with luck and timing, they can generate significant profits — even if they never hit 1 Euro."

The CTO of Kendu Inu will be the greatest comeback story ever,memecoins,1i838n0,2025-01-23 08:23:24,120,0.95,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i838n0/the_cto_of_kendu_inu_will_be_the_greatest/,soFinished,ETH,"Hey guys, if you don't already know, Kendu Inu has undergone a coup d'état and have overthrown our old developer, Miazaki. I want to preface this post with an apology of some sorts. This takeover has been a long time coming, however it was never publically released out of need to keep peace and we were hoping that Miazaki would come back to his former self, which obviously never happened. A lot of people on reddit said that Miazaki was very detrimental for the community and were downvoted, but were correct the whole time, so I'm sorry if you were one of the people that raised your voice and was shut down, when the entire time you were right.

Anyway, in mine and many others opinions, the community was the real alpha, and everything else was just extra. Miazaki has sent us the rest of his supply, which came to about 1.3% of the total kendu supply, which is worth as of typing this 290k USD (this wallet can be found here: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xd22849fcb4c83389e65a1c40748a9b67157638a3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd22849fcb4c83389e65a1c40748a9b67157638a3), which can be verified by typing /crowdfund in the Kendu Inu telegram), we are setting up a multisig for this wallet asap as well. This means that we know have a community wallet that can be used for marketing, listings, giveaways and much more, which will be insanely useful in the future.

Furthermore, Miazaki was one of the biggest sell pressures (if not THE BIGGEST) on the chart, shown through him down from 7.8% to 1.3% before finally being forced by the CTO lead to give this supply up. This means that on the way up it will be a much smoother journey without big dumps and FUD surrounding one wallet. For further proof I reccomend reading through this twitter post which covers the situation very nicely: [https://x.com/realkyler\_1/status/1881424284092145843](https://x.com/realkyler_1/status/1881424284092145843)

Now with the CTO you might imagine that Kendu may be a sinking ship, but I can ensure you that it is completely the opposite of this. Many old faces have shown up since Miazaki left, I could name names but the list would be far too long for it to be worth writing here, but the evidence is in the telegram. Activity has been very close if not surpassing all time high here. This is insanely bullish and I'm getting May 2024 vibes here before we mooned. This will be the greatest comeback story of all crypto history, and if you do not respect it now I can guarantee that you will in the future. I'm going to keep this post short to not drone on forever, but I'll leave with telling you to study convicted communities, and remember history does not repeat, but often rhymes... look at the Shib chart, do you think it's possible that something similar can happen to Kendu?

Shibarium Theory - A Must Read,ShibaInuCandorGroup,1i81g9u,2025-01-23 06:39:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibaInuCandorGroup/comments/1i81g9u/shibarium_theory_a_must_read/,SHIBgeneral,,"This is a long read but well worth the time, in my opinion. 

A comment was made on one of our posts about Shibarium and whether it would be run on Polygon in an effort to reduce fees. A fellow member pointed out that Shytoshi had once commented that it wouldn't be run on polygon but a polygon like network inferring that the devs were attempting to develop their own layer 2 (L2) protocol. I've had some theories for a while and this really got me thinking... how does a new L2 for in with ShibaSwap tokenomics... and here's my theory. Please forgive me if I ramble at all, it's 2:30am here and I've had 5 hours of sleep in 2 days. Comment below and let me know what y'all think... am I onto something here or am I way out in left field on this? 


I remember reading that Shytoshi said Shibarium would be run on a polygon like protocol. I think it would be great if the devs in fact created their own L2 protocol, but my reservation is why recreate the wheel to get the same outcome? So that got me thinking what would I do if I was the devs to set ShibaSwap ahead of the competition. I dabble in programming just so I can try and understand some of this stuff, and I think I know the answer. If I'm way off please tell me, I'm not an expert by any means. Anyways, when we talk about defi protocols, the two that really compete are uniswap V3 and Sushiswap using polygon.  Both swaps are great in their own right but both have fundamental issues. V3 revolutionized the way liquidity pools operated. Traditional pools spread out your liquidity pairs from 0 to infinity, even though a significant portion of that range will never be used. V3 allowed for concentrated efficiency where a liquidity provider could concentrate their capital into specific price points reducing investor exposure to impermanent loss and increasing fees earned by over 500% in some pools (aka an investor could earn 5x the fees than a traditional liquidity pool). The downside was that gas fees are still ridiculously high on V3 because it's still using the Ethereum network. Then you have Sushiswap who built out a L2 through polygon reducing fees and increasing speed of transactions. It also allowed users to use the ""matic bridge"" to swap tokens between ERC20 and other networks, by a process of minting and burning tokens going back and forth. The beauty is it allowed users to access other cross chain tokens through a single interface, and best of all users paid for gas fees in their native Matic coin instead of Eth. Sushiswap also allowed users to access Kashi Lending whereby users could trade on leverage or margin, for those investors who wanted to take big swings in crypto. This also had the benefit of allowing liquidity providers to put up their tokens for margin trading, earning good returns and no exposure to impermanent loss since it was only 1 token investments. Sushiswap also developed a token vault known as BentoBox that allowed for margin trading in 1 transaction hash versus other margin trading platforms that required 3 transaction hashes, saving huge amounts on gas fees and increasing transaction speeds. 

I guess what I'm getting at is Shibarium needs to be if V3 Uniswap and Sushiswap protocols had a baby. Shibarium would allow for concentrated capital liquidity pools, the ability to switch tokens across different blockchains using SHIB as gas (only utility I can see for it... change my mind), and allow users access to margin and leveraged trading, while simultaneously allowing additional revenue streams for liquidity providers and creating token vaults. If Shibarium managed to incorporate the best of both swaps, it could begin to compete for heavy volume which would bring back the billion dollar TVL numbers. But if that weren't enough, if the devs could incorporate their own algorithmic stable coin Shi into the mix as a daily transactional token, whereby users could buy and sell with it, with minimal fees, and giving sellers the security of a stable coin, and the speed of visa, it would truly begin to revolutionize crypto. 

IF the devs can pull this off it would be a game changer in crypto defi platforms. SHIB would finally have a purpose, Shi would become a global currency, BONE would be highly coveted by whales who wanted governance over the future decisions of the swap, and LEASH would be the value store to bring in institutional investors, similar to what Bitcoin is. Uniswap earns $2-3M in fees per day, and Sushiswap earns $1.2M in fees per day (as of January), there's no reason ShibaSwap wouldn't be able to easily pull in $3-5M in fees through its platform if it was able to implement this plan. It's an ambitious goal but one that I think makes the most amount of sense and maybe why the devs are playing things pretty close to the vest as the saying goes because they don't want the other swaps to pivot before they release Shibarium. 

Let's hear your thoughts. Anyone else have a theory on what type of protocol Shibarium will run on or benefits they should implement? 

Also, if you know of other users who haven't been invited here, please help me continue to grow this page by sending them a message recommending they come check our page out. This article and others like it, are only going to have effect if we can get exposure to a larger audience. Personally I think this theory could give hope to so many who have begun losing hope in SHIB and the entire ecosystem....I know it gives me hope and in my mind it helps me begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together into a congruent picture. And it doesn't hurt that I believe if this happens, we're all going to be very well off having gotten in very early."
Could I visually miss pyoderma?,AskVet,1i81ej0,2025-01-23 06:36:20,2,0.75,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1i81ej0/could_i_visually_miss_pyoderma/,shibalore,,"Hi all. I'm in an argument with my human medical doctor right now.

I was just diagnosed (as a human) with *Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.* I'm on very strong immunosuppresants (the dose used for someone about 2.5 my size). To me, this is not rocket science. It's an opportunistic bacteria and I'm an easy target.

My doctor is insisting that my dog is also infected. From my understanding, this bacteria lives on most dogs the way that Staph (well, the human staph) lives in most people's noses.

The main infestation of this bacteria is pyoderma from my understanding. I'm not a vet, but my dog isn't particularly big and I've checked her over sixty dozen times and she does not have (as far as I am aware) pyoderma. I know it can show up as a UTI, but I'd also know if she had a UTI. I think I read the bacteria can show up as an infection of the uterus (is it the same bacteria that causes pyometra? If so, my pup has been spayed long ago). The last option that I found is in the ear, which, sure, maybe, who knows -- but I'm not sure what would infect me to this degree?

We're going to the vet in two hours anyway -- this was great timing as this appointmennt was already made. My (human) doctor is just very convinced my dog is diseased but I'm very convinced this is just bad luck. There's a language barrier between me and the vet, so I wanted to ask here as well to be certain. Thank you!

Quick ETA: For the record, I have no problem treating my pup if she has the disease. My frustration is more that I feel like I'm looking for something that she doesn't have. 

Dog information:

\* Species: canine  
\* Age: Unknown (rescue). Estimates put her between 7-11.  
\* Sex/Neuter status: Spayed female  
\* Breed: Shiba Inu  
\* Body weight: 12kg/27lbs (see below)  
\* History: Cushing's (hence the chonk status), Kidney disease. Both been well controlled for 5+ years (puppy mill rescue, lost genetic lottery. Been with me for 5+ years, though).  
\* Clinical signs: None

Dogecoin: From Internet Joke to Billion-Dollar Movement,BlockchainDev,1i7zu0r,2025-01-23 04:43:35,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainDev/comments/1i7zu0r/dogecoin_from_internet_joke_to_billiondollar/,Internal_West_3833,,"Dogecoin started as a joke, plain and simple. Created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was never meant to be taken seriously. Inspired by the popular ""Doge"" meme a Shiba Inu dog with comic sans text, it was just a fun way to poke fun at the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But fast forward to today, and Dogecoin has become much more than a meme; it’s a global movement.

At its core, Dogecoin is about community. From the beginning, it attracted people who loved its lighthearted approach and the idea of tipping others online as a way to spread kindness. Over time, the Dogecoin community started doing more than just tipping. They began funding real-world projects. They’ve raised money for charity, sponsored a NASCAR driver, and even helped send a satellite to space.

What makes Dogecoin unique isn’t just its origin story or its cheerful mascot; it’s the sense of fun and inclusivity that defines it. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that are overly technical or serious, Dogecoin is approachable. It’s not trying to revolutionize finance, it’s just trying to make it a little more fun.

Of course, Dogecoin has had its share of critics. Some argue it’s not technically advanced or that it lacks the serious features of other blockchains. But its supporters argue that Dogecoin’s real value lies in its ability to bring people together. It’s a reminder that crypto doesn’t always have to be about complexity or competition, it can also be about community and having a good laugh.

And yes, jokes can be worth billions. Thanks to its loyal fanbase and high-profile supporters like Elon Musk, Dogecoin’s market value has soared, proving that even a playful idea can make a massive impact.

What do you think about Dogecoin’s rise to fame?

Is it just a passing trend, or does it have staying power in the world of crypto?

Share your thoughts. Do you see Dogecoin as a joke, a movement, or maybe a little of both?"

Bitcoins were given by Satoshi, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

Doge were granted to the memelords, great WOW and legends in the mountain of memecoins.

And Shib, Shiba Inu were gifted to the race of degens, who above all else, desire gains.

But they were all of them deceived, for another coin was made.

In the land of the trenches, in the jeetry of Mount DeFi, the Dark Lord Kendu forged in secret a master coin.

And into this project he created an army, his ethos and his will to dominate all of crypto.

One Inu to rule them all. "

Meds: Gabapentin 100mg as needed, TriHeart Plus monthly, Apoquel as needed

We have not introduced anything new into his diet, have removed treats & added milk thistle after the December lab work. 

There seemed to be no care plan or recommendations going forward other than “*these values are signs of normal aging*.” A 300% increase in values over three months is concerning to me, especially considering he is asymptomatic.

He has been referred for an ultrasound, but other than giving Denamarin - is this the best plan going forward? How often should these labs be repeated/a follow up be made?
