Mein erster Totalshaden,automobil,1i9xkot,2025-01-25 16:29:45,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/automobil/comments/1i9xkot/mein_erster_totalshaden/,Roffel_I,Mein Sch√§tzchen,"Auto ist ein Totalschaden. √úber 36.000‚Ç¨ f√ºr die Reparatur laut Versicherung.

https://preview.redd.it/0lvqjxl8k7fe1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f12822cadfa95877f17f5a177d2ada219e36467

Eine kleine Hintergrundgeschichte: Eines Tages bekam ich einen Brief von BMW wegen einer R√ºckrufaktion bez√ºglich eines Abgasw√§rmetauschers oder so etwas √§nlichem. Ok, sagte ich und brachte den Wagen zum vereinbartem Termin zu meiner lokalen BMW Werkstatt.

Am n√§chsten Tag habe ich ihn wieder abgeholt. Alles war gut.

Einen Tag sp√§ter hatte ich eine l√§ngere Fahrt geplant wo es selbstverst√§ndlich auf die Autobahn ging. Wo mir aufgefallen ist, dass wenn ich stark beschleunige (ca. 4000U/min) das Auto sofort seine Leistung reduziert (maximal 2200U/min). Keine Fehlercodes wohlgemerkt. Ein Neustart des Autos hat das Problem behoben. Rief bei meiner Werkstatt an, sie sagten, es sei wahrscheinlich in Ordnung und ich soll bei n√§chster gelegenheit vorbeischauen. Nachdem wir am selben Tag zur√ºckgekommen sind, haben wir das Auto wieder bei der Wekstatt abgestellt.

Am n√§chsten Tag hat die Werkstatt das Auto auf Fehlercodes ausgelesen und es Probe gefahren. Alles ok keine Fehler oder Auff√§lligkeiten.

Am n√§chsten Tag nahmen wir den Karren zur√ºck und probierten es erneut aus. Wieder Leistungsverlusst.

Am n√§chstem Tag das Auto wieder abgegeben und sogar mit dem Werkstattmeister eine Runde gedreht. Worauf er das ganze Auto mit neuer Software bespielt hat. Auto wieder abgeholt.

Tag sp√§ter haben wir versucht wieder etwas weiter weg zu fahren. Wieder Leistungsverlusst. Auto Zuhause gelassen und ein anderes genommen. Am selben Abend wollten wir zur√ºck zur Wekstatt fahren, um ihn dort √ºber Nacht stehen zu lassen, damit die Werkstatt sich am Morgen wieder ran machen konnte. Auf dieser Fahrt ist es passiert.

Beim Beschleunigen erschien ein lautes Ger√§usch wie bei einer sich drehenden Turbine. Ich bin die letzten so 4km zur Werkstatt durch die Stadt sehr langsam gefahren. Wagen wieder √ºber Nacht da gelassen.

Am n√§chsten morgen hat der Chef uns angerufen und mitgeteit, dass die Werkstatt ein riesiger Fehler gemacht hat. Es stellte sich heraus, dass eine Schraube in den Turbo gesaugt wurde und ihn vollst√§ndig zerst√∂rt hat. Von den Turbinenbl√§ttern war nichts √ºbrig geblieben. Das fast schon Lustige daran ist, dass DIE SCHRAUBE NICHT EINMAL VON DIESEM AUTO WAR. Der Chef war sehr Einsichtig und sagte, dass sie alles reparieren werden, aber es wird etwa 2 Monate dauern (Ende November bis Mitte Januar). Etwa 9000‚Ç¨ sagten sie, w√ºrde es deren Versicherung kosten. Zum Gl√ºck hatte ich die M√∂glichkeit Autos von der Familie zu benutzen. Die Werkstatt bot ein Ersatzauto f√ºr die Zeit an, aber wir lehnten ab.

Habe diese Woche endlich einen Anruf bekommen. Aufgeregt nahm ich an und hoffte zu h√∂ren, dass ich mein Auto abholen kann. Stattdessen h√∂re ich ein ""Totalshaden"". Die Werkstatt sagte, es sind √ºberall Metallsp√§hne nachzuweisen und die Reparaturkosten belaufen sich auf von der Versicherung gesch√§tzen 38.000‚Ç¨ (gutachter von der Versicherung).

Mal schauen wie das alles zu Ende geht. Der Werkstattchef war schonmal sehr entgegenkommend.

Und wie lief euer Jahresanfang so."

Taking this evo out for the first time today and I just cannot get it to stop climbing. This is my 4th UMX so I'm not a total newb but am still learning!

The main issue is that with SAFE on I can get the plane to fly level by using the transmitter trim but the second I turn SAFE off the plane dives... If I use the transmitter trim to get the plane to fly level with SAFE off then it climbs like crazy the second I turn SAFE on.

Can you have separate trims for when SAFE is off and on? That would solve it if that's possible.

The other issue is that to manually adjust the elevator trim you have to unscrew the attachment but the screw faces the fuselage so I can't get my hex into it. What the heck?

I had such high hopes for this plane. Please help!"
AH's Finest: The Fleet that conquered Central Europe.,ultimateadmiral,1i9x4c4,2025-01-25 16:09:25,7,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x4c4,ClayEndfield,,"My fully modernized AH Fleet, pictured smallest to largest. In my opinion some of the best hulls of their type in the game. Numbers of hulls in service/building as listed:

DD Vordt Class: 123
CA Heilung Class: 43
BB Eternus Class: 34
BB Aldritch Class: 12
BB Gundyr Class: 3
BB Smough Class: 6
BB Ornstein Class: 7

A short overview of each Class

DD Vordt: One of my first attempts at building a Modern Destroyer. Snapped together like legos, though refining the design took some effort. 40 Knots, max Armor, 6x double 5.9"" superfiring turrets complimented by 10x triple 2.9"" mounts and 22x 24"" Oxygen Torpedoes. ASW Optimized. An absolute work horse of a design, these badboys compliment and strike force as 2nd line escorts and are the perfect submarine hunter/convoy raider. Made Light Cruisers completely redundant.

CA Heilung: Another workhorse. An ASW capable pocket battleship, this is the smallest ship in my fleet with 100% Gun Damage resistance. Thanks to its less than terrible speed, high firepower, and insane durability thanks to the Damage Control Buff from Crane Funnels, this CA has no issue fights capital ships 5x it's displacement. Similar to the Vordt, the Heilung's capabilities and armament made Battlecruisers redundant.

BB Eternus: A modernized Antique, the Eternus has served as the venerable backbone of my fleet since its inception in 1902. Since then, this storied hull has undergone 3 major refits/modernization efforts. There's a certain character to this hulk, a ship that's served three generations of sailors. The thought of fresh faced ensigns being trained by their grizzled fathers and grandfathers on the same boat has a narrative element that's made this play through feel far more organic. The first ship of the fleet to achieve -100% Gun damage resistance, the endurance of the hull prevalence of the design speaks for itself. 

BB Aldritch: THE unsinkable ship. Though comparatively lightly armed, the combination of Crane Funnels and Countermeasures with AH's iconic -100% Gun Damage stat has made the Wolverine of BBs. With a Veteran Crew, Damage Control is maxed at 500%, with improved Water Pumping, Extinguishing, and Engine Repair from Aux Engine, Turbo Electric Engine, Reinforced Bulkheads and Anti-flooding, it mends itself at a freakish rate. I've managed to reduce its flashfire chance to 0.03%. Overall a favorite of mine, and fully capable of defeating much larger ships through attrition.

BB Gundyr: A hypothetical design for a hypothetical nation. What if Austro-Hungary had attempted the Arsenal Ship concept in the 1940s? Fairly delicate, and reasonably fast (for an AH battleship) the Gundyr specializes in breaking up fleet formations with 114 Torp Salvos before falling back to second line to provide fire support with its 15.9"" guns. While not the most reliable powerhouse, it does a phenomenal job keeping escorts away from my slower 1st line warships and sending enemy capitals into evasive maneuvering, buying time to close on their fleet.

BB Smough: Another -100% Gun Damage boat, reinforced by the wild Watchtower Funnel Buffs. The Smough class plays 2nd fiddle to both ends my naval design philosophy's Spectrum. 2nd toughest Ship and 2nd most powerful, the Smough has more endurance than my flagship, and mire firepower than the Aldritch.

BB Ornstein: The powerhouse of my fleet. Designed to solo entire fleets, the Ornstein manages AH's -100% Damage reduction standard, and an immense arsenal for demolishing everything from Capital ships to their escorts. AH's 111,000 ton Modernized Dreadnought has made the pursuit of Super BBs redundant. Ample deck space and casemates allow for a phenomenal compliment of Mains and Secondaries. My favorite of the 100,000+ ton hulls for an obvious reason."
What are the best GUI noob friendly multilingual transcription options?,LocalLLaMA,1i9x3wa,2025-01-25 16:08:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i9x3wa/what_are_the_best_gui_noob_friendly_multilingual/,Bowbowjowjow,Question | Help,"To preface - most of the options I have found are locally hosted and seem to rely on some variation of open ai's whisper. My use case requires multilingual capability. Some of these options might work great in English so keep that in mind while Im sharing my experience.

The best options I have found are:

[Vibe](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/vibe) \- free / MIT license. It separates the text roughly based on the spoken sentences. Microphone mode seems to record your speech and transcribe it after you stop the recording.

[SpeechPulse](https://speechpulse.com/) \- 30 days free trial with 1 time payment (currently it's 60 bucks/ according to [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20240225205030/https://speechpulse.com/buy/) it was 20 bucks). it has diarization so the text is separated based on the speaker. Live mode allows you to write in the text fields of other programs on the fly. System audio mode allows you to transcribe audio coming out of your speakers.

My least favorite of the ones that managed to transcribe the audio file is [Buzz](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/buzz) because the options to separates the text were either based on words or no separation at all.

I couldnt get the following alternatives to work properly:

[Biniou](https://github.com/Woolverine94/biniou) \- it's all in one local AI hub GUI (includes text-gen, image-gen, audio-gen, ect) that has the option to load different versions of whisper v3. The problem was that the generated text was in an entirely different language than the one selected

[SoftWhisper](https://github.com/NullMagic2/SoftWhisper) \- I couldnt get it work at all.

[Whisper WebGPU](https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo-webgpu) \- I set the correct language but all it did is repeat the same 2 words over and over again. (it was using whisper-large-v3-turbo). It seems to use your GPU so maybe it is somewhat locally hosted? Naturally I wouldnt use it for sensitive data.

I would love to hear about more noob friendly alternatives. If you know any please share them!"
What is the likelihood that I can use a tuned ECU (ME221) from someone else's car?,Miata,1i9x3rp,2025-01-25 16:08:42,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/1i9x3rp/what_is_the_likelihood_that_i_can_use_a_tuned_ecu/,Puzzleheaded-Tax-810,HELP !!!,"Context: I Bought a complete turbo kit that came off a MK2.5, 1.6 Engine (Same as mine), the ME221 has been mapped and done 250bhp. 

The previous owner just had an uprated fuel pump, injectors, and I'm guessing a performance clutch, I have all that

Would it be safe for me to attempt to drive the car on this ECU and kit to a tuners without doing any tuning beforehand to it?, this will be when I fit the complete turbo kit

My mind is telling me it's unsafe, and I'm questioning even if my engine could handle roughly 250 BHP with it being just over half way through its lifespan

But then again it's came off the exact same car, so why wouldn't it be fine? I understand all engines perform slightly different but I don't know lmao.

Cheers in advance.

I currently have a GrimmSpeed J Pipe V1 and an R400. I absolutely love the low deep tone that the R400 gives, but it's a little too quiet for my liking.  I also want more of the exhaust whistle that these cars can have, which the R400 gets rid of.  I want this thing to whistle like a jet, but still keep the low tone of the R400.

I'm looking for a new exhaust and I am currently deciding between the Tomei, the AWE track or ETS Extreme (they seem similar), or the Hellfire Fabrications Bastard Pipe V2.  If there are other options that you would suggest, please list them!

I have also considered cutting the resonator out of my R400, if anyone has experience with this please do tell.  I know Nameless makes muffler deletes for the R400, there's just not many videos out there of this and idk how it would sound.

I already have an intake, turbo inlet, and bypass valve to hear the turbo from the engine bay, I want to be able to hear it from the exhaust too."

I didn‚Äôt see any notification saying they pulled that money out of our joint return from last year (2023s return) however we did have a very small return compared to what we were anticipating. He doesn‚Äôt see any notices on his Turbo Tax account (the platform he used to file his 2022 taxes where he owed) about still owing money. 

Did the IRS just take the previous money owed from him as a single filer from our married filing jointly return? 

I just want to make sure if they didn‚Äôt that I make sure they get paid this year to avoid anymore interest or penalties that I‚Äôm sure would be accruing. "

$1,300 autoloan

$405 travel trailer

$300 insurance

Approximate $75 ish to fill fuel tank and then $22 every 3 fills for DEF (diesel exhaust fluid).

Ideally an established business in any of the states below or others OK too:

Colorado  
Wyoming  
Nebraska  
South Dakota  
New Mexico

A lot of ‚Äúturbo granny is a hero‚Äù stuff, and it weirds me out. Yes, she it is commendable to save Momo, but she also sa‚Äôd and violated a young teen (Okarun) herself. That isn‚Äôt just glossed over but celebrated by people. That is what weirds me out, the way the show tries to make the audience feel bad for her, despite the fact that she very much could do those awful things to more young boys if she had the chance, or Seiko clearly making Okarun uncomfortable at the end of episode 4 etc. I do enjoy the show, but the discourse surrounding it is very strange to me.

Replacing thermal paste of a Asus tuf A15 gaming laptop,Asustuf,1i9wd8b,2025-01-25 15:36:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asustuf/comments/1i9wd8b/replacing_thermal_paste_of_a_asus_tuf_a15_gaming/,ChickenDinna007,,"Hi there, I have a Asus tuf A15 gaming laptop (2021) that has started heating up quite a lot where the GPU went up from max 75¬∞C to around 85¬∞C. For the CPU it keeps going to 90¬∞C + (without it turbo boosting) from a usual 80¬∞C. Because of this, I want to replace my thermal paste and I think I have found that Ptm7950 by Honeywell might be perfect. 

But I also want to replace the thermal pads of my laptop. I did consider K5 pro, but after reading about the mess it makes after boiling, I just completely reconsidered. Any advice here, because this is where I am mostly stuck... And also where can I buy the recommended pads/putty.

Also, for the ptm7950, where can I actually get the genuine stuff. I have found a few on AliExpress and some people say they are genuine, but I still have some concerns that these are fake. And if they are real, which seller?

Any tips will be greatly appreciated. "

Foam Clay advice.,cosplayprops,1i9vprn,2025-01-25 15:07:22,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplayprops/comments/1i9vprn/foam_clay_advice/,Shin_Matsunaga_,Help,"Hi all, I'm wanting to recreate something life sized and was thinking foam clay was a good idea to use, but I was wondering what the dos and don'ts are of using it. Should I have a foil core with polymer clay shell to stop potential sagging? How do you blend it? Does it have a maximum size you can make something before it collapses on itself without support? There's probably more I should ask, but I can't think of anything, so any help you can offer would be awesome.

For reference, what I want to make is a life sized upright on two legs version of Turbo Granny in Maneki Neko form. 

I've worked with polymer clay before, but never Foam clay.

Thanks in advance!"
"M440i, AMG GT, LC500, 991 Carrera S vs. RCF and why I got the RCF",LexusRC,1i9voxz,2025-01-25 15:06:22,7,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LexusRC/comments/1i9voxz/m440i_amg_gt_lc500_991_carrera_s_vs_rcf_and_why_i/,windmill09,,"I spent a year test driving and renting cars before I test drove and immediately bought an RCF.  I thought Id share my experience and thought.  I currently owned a 2015 RCF w/ carbon fiber tvd package (just bought) and a G37 IPL I am slowly modding up. I used to own a 987 Boxster, N55 335i M sport, 350z, e30 325i, Lexus GS350 and an NA Mx5. I also have driven a ton of other cars, like mustang GTs, s2000, and Mclarens. I am more of a drifter than someone that shoots for times at the track.

M440i - almost bought one. I used to own a 335i which I hated because it broke down every 2 months.  However everyone has been raving about the B58.  However, I didn't end up buying it because I didn't like (1) how it drove since it was AWD and it didn't like to slide, (2) how it sounded as I preferred a V8, (3) how it looked.  Launch control was amazing, but really impractical. Very cool car overall and high tech auto driving and parking features.

AMG GT - I was sure this was the one.  Turbo V8 sounded like a hot rod.  However it had too much grip.  I like to slide. Also I was seriously concerned about reliability. Based on reports, the V8 engine is stout, but not ancillary parts. It also looked a bit phallic.

991.1 Carrera - Beautiful car, but it really drove like my old 987 Boxster. It feels like the same car but a bit faster in the higher rpms. Makes sense since I found out about 80% of the Boxster parts are the same as the 911.  Again, too much grip. Screaming engine, but I'm more into v8s now.  

LC500 - very disappointing.  Cumbersome.  Didn't accelerate faster than my modded G37.  Didn't like to turn. And especially did not like to downshift.  It refused to let me down shift even if the lower gear had plenty of revs to go. Could not hear the exhaust in the car at all. Inside was too isolating even with the windows down. Beautiful car inside and out tho, but wow. I almost choose not to try an RCF because of this car.

GS350 - I owned it for awhile. I tried to make it handle by adding coilovers. Didn't work.  Center of gravity is too high.

RCF - I bought it right away. This has been the best GT sports car I've ever driven.  Its like driving a luxury drift car. Its tail happy but easy to control. People give it crap for having an IS interior but the Interior to me was better than the LC500.  The LC500 has more leather, but the RCF has carbon fiber.  It just looked less ""old man"" and more sporty without looking cheaper.  It's a beautiful interior and I'm sure it will hold up.  Almost all the interior plastics in my 987 Boxster broke and costed hundreds to replace (vanity mirrors, side mirrors adjustment motors, air vents, switches). Little road noise on the highway. The gears are a bit too tall and the engine feels like it has turbo lag, but when it pulls, it's exciting.  It breaks traction and the V8 roars.  Suspension is stiff, but acceptable for a car like this imo. Its heavy. It feels like it but somehow it handles great.  It doesn't handle like my G37 on coilovers tho, but V8 makes it much more of an occasion.  And it looks like a beast.  I really feel journalists have done an injustice on this car.  Sure the BMWs might be faster, but this is already way too fast for the road. It also sounds better and is way more fun to drive.  I haven't driven it on a track.  I heard it's impossible to shut off ABS and it interferes in long drifts, thus the journalist complaints (Clarkson and Throttle House) that were heard while track driving, but it's a GT road car and imo, it's one of the best ever made. It drifts well for short moments you want to take a left turn or bust a U turn like an idiot. Im sure the w205 C63 AMG may be close, but has anyone seen the Redriven mechanic's report on it's issues?  All the owners that said it was reliable only drove it 3k miles a year. Come on. It's like BMW owners saying the N55 was reliable. Those cars really are not. All the plastics will break and require taking out the engine endlessly.  I think people need to demand higher quality from car makers and it will only work if journalists would start reviewing the quality of the mechanics as well."

Enchantment Tier List - Jan 25 2025,PlayTheBazaar,1i9vkc1,2025-01-25 15:00:50,0,0.14,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayTheBazaar/comments/1i9vkc1/enchantment_tier_list_jan_25_2025/,nymusix,Discussion,"As of today, Jan 25, here is my enchantment tier list for The Bazaar with general explanations of each ranking. Of course, there is some variability, as different enchantments can be particularly strong with certain builds or item combos.

**S Tier**

* *Shiny:* One of the rarest enchants in the game is also arguably its most powerful. Having an item trigger twice can be enough of a mechanic on its own to turn a strong build into an insane one or turn a weak build into a strong one. Getting shiny on a heavy-hitting weapon, or an item that has some fast charge looping ability, can simply mean game over for your foes. The only downside to shiny? It's one of the hardest enchantments in the game to get. Unlike other enchantments, it's not available as a level-up reward or as an enchant from Fate's Crossroads (first death enchantment event). You can acquire an item already enchanted with this from Pearl's Dig Site or Serafina (enchanted item vendor), you can get this from the random enchantment interaction, or enchant a weapon with the Form event (rare weapon event). A fun cheese for this one is that there are a handful of items where shiny is the only enchant, perhaps most notably Robotics Factory, so dropping those items into the random enchantment event can guarantee a shiny Robotics Factory (+2 multicast on your friends! Insane!)
* *Icy:* Arguably as good or better than shiny, icy is almost as rare to come by, and potentially as powerful. The ability to get continuous freeze for an entire fight is broken against most boards, particularly if you are able to put this enchant on a fast item and even moreso if you are able to get Snowflake. Most freeze skills are now pretty heavily limited, making this enchant one of the only ways to lock your opponent's items in perpetuity. Particularly with the last patch removing Rapid Thaw, the only counter to this effect is the Radiant enchant. 


**A Tier**

* *Heavy & Turbo:* Grouping these two enchantments together makes a lot of sense as they do pretty similar things, and being able to impact the speed of a fight can have dramatic impact, particularly for more drawn out battles. Between the two of these, I have heavy as generally being just a hair better, for a couple of reasons; namely, there are two curio items that improve the heavy enchant as opposed to just one for turbo, and also because there are a fair number of skills that can provide internal haste without needing to spend an enchantment on it. But there are absolutely situations where turbo might be better for your board, and I'm basically never upset to see one of these enchants show up. 

**B Tier**

* *Radiant:* Radiant can be an incredibly strong effect on the right board, but it's often situationally not very valuable. For single weapon builds, or builds where one item running without being slowed is incredibly important to the board composition, radiant can mean the difference between life and death. Radiant is also incredibly powerful because radiant items can still be targeted by your enemy's slow, destroy, and freeze effects, meaning they effectively preserve your other items from those targets. However, radiant can be less useful on a wider board of smaller items, because there are so many targets for enemy slow/destroy/freeze. It's also worth mentioning here that radiant does not protect your items from having their cooldowns increased by effects like that of Fort, Chronobarrier, or Atomic Clock. 

* *Deadly:* Like radiant, the deadly enchant can be an incredibly powerful effect on the right board but sometimes just getting +50% crit on one item isn't all that powerful, particularly if you already have a lot of crit, or ways to scale crit separately (like Building Crescendo). Look to pair the deadly enchant with specific items that have unique effects - Crow's Nest, Miss Isles, Caltrops, and Crook all have particularly strong deadly enchants, and I'm sure there are others as well. 
* *Shielded:* The shielded enchant goes somewhat hand-in-hand with the C-Tier enchants, Restorative and Obsidian. Where shielded has a slight edge lies in three main details: firstly, that you can stack shield on top of your base health, secondly, in the fact that shield has a stronger protective effect against enemy burn, and finally, because there are builds utilizing items like Force Field or Crusher Claw builds where you can turn your shield into a weapon. 

**C Tier**

* *Restorative & Obsidian:* Obsidian is slightly more situational as it can only be used on weapons, which makes it useless in non-weapon builds; however, having a weapon with life steal can be situationally powerful with certain skills like the Death Knight Reaper's Hypnotic Drain. Neither of these enchants are particularly strong, but in some cases, having one of these enchants can be a life-saver. 

**D Tier**

* *Fiery & Toxic:* Whereas most of the higher tier enchants are basically never useless, Fiery and Toxic are two enchants that can tend to be useless in a lot of builds. If you're already running burn or poison builds, getting these enchants can dramatically increase your outputted damage, but often in those situations you're more looking to increase your item loop speed or control the board; and if you're not running burn or poison, these enchants often do very little to effectively improve your build, particularly as it can be very tough to scale these enchants to a point where they're useful. These enchants can still be situationally useful for non-burn/poison Pygs - putting any enchantment on a property item will dramatically increase the value of that item, and with a Fiery Lemonade Stand, Pyg can have a 100 burn infinite looping matchbox - pretty busted - but generally speaking these two will be the worst enchants you'll usually see.

**F Tier**

* *Golden:* We started with one of the rarest enchants in the game, and now we're ending with another. The Golden enchant is an enchant that is most relevant to economy-based items. As a result, there are absolutely situations where Pyg can utilize these items to improve board-based effects or where they can give your build much-needed econ. However, usually by the time these enchanted items start being available to you, you should have a pretty strong economy going already, and a lot of the effects of this enchant are so situational as to be practically useless. Basically the only ways to get this enchant are to either buy an item with this enchant already on it, or get the enchantment from the ""Random Enchantment"" event, so thankfully you don't have to worry about running into this enchant on the Fate's Crossroads event. 


Hope to hear what you all think and maybe you'll find this helpful in some way!"

Is my training method cruel?,Dogtraining,1i9vg0p,2025-01-25 14:55:31,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1i9vg0p/is_my_training_method_cruel/,analogvape,constructive criticism welcome,"Hey everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster. Recently, a few friends of mine commented on how my method of training my dog to stay out of the kitchen was ""cruel"". I would love to get outside opinions because I absolutely want to make sure that I'm not traumatizing my dog in some way. 

about 9 months ago I adopted a 5 month old lab/GSD mix. I always had dogs in the house growing up, and my grandma ran a doggy day care. This is my first doggo as an adult as I finally purchased a house and have time and space for one. So this is my first go round of training a dog all by myself. 

I adopted my boy ""Turbo"" from someone who got in way over their heads. When I got him he was this insane mass of energy which is why I gave him his new name lol. 

We have put in so much work together, and he has grown in to an amazing dog. I spent a lot of time socializing him, and breaking bad habits he had picked up in his previous home. His recall is amazing, he knows all the basic commands, and even some fun ones, my favorite being ""turbo spin"" which is him spinning in circles faster than what should be possible. 

Anyways, here's the actual story. My little guy loves food. The hardest thing for me to break was him coming in to the kitchen and begging while I was cooking. I used to be a chef so I kind of go all out when I cook. My kitchen isn't huge, and my main concern was that it was simply just dangerous for him to be in the kitchen while I'm cooking. At first I would kinda just ""shoo"" him out of the kitchen but pretty quickly he learned that he could just quietly sneak in while I was distracted which is even more dangerous. I would hate to trip on him while holding a hot pan or a knife. 

One day I was making a sandwich and dropped a pickle slice on the floor. Turbo snuck in and tried to swoop the pickle up except he absolutely hated the pickle. He sniffed it, scrunched his face up, and left. That's when I had my lightbulb moment. For the next couple of weeks every time I was cooking I would bring out my pickle jar and put it on the counter. When he would come in and start begging I would offer him a pickle and he'd be repulsed and leave. Eventually he just gave up, and he no longer comes in while I'm cooking. I want to preface, I never did any of my pickle offerings in malice. He would come in to start begging and I would hold my hand out with the pickle. There was no trickery involved.

A few days ago I had a couple of friends and their dogs over and I was boasting about how I got Turbo to stay out of the kitchen while I'm cooking and both of my friends told me that I was cruel and that what I did was traumatizing and that he's just scared of going in to the kitchen now. 

In my head I really don't see it that way. The way I see it is that he's begging because he wants something, I offer to him what im willing to share, and he does not like what I have to offer. I believe that we came to an understanding that all I can offer him from the kitchen is a pickle and he does not want it. 

I don't yell at my dog, everything we've worked on together has been done with positive reinforcement, and lots of patience. He's a great boy and we have worked so hard together. The thought of him being traumatized from my actions breaks my heart. 

I also want to note that after the pickle offering he shows no body language or signs of being fearful, he just despises pickles and wants nothing to do with them, he has no reaction to me at all but only to the pickles.

I seem to do pretty well against some players on Live up until a certain point and then I just get destroyed.

I don‚Äôt want to be the person who does something to the car voids the warranty and has to pay a crazy amount to fix the turbos if they blow. I‚Äôve read about catch cans, heat exchangers, and jb4s.

My Forte has been great and I like the design on the new K4 but it's a bit more expensive than some of the other options and has a bit worse fuel economy now with it's turbo model which is the one I'd get. I spend about 1.5 hours in it commuting every day so fuel economy is important which is why I've been looking into my other options. 

Based on what research I've done so far I'm currently considering the K4, Elantra, Mazda 3, Jetta and Civic. I've never been a huge fan of Toyota's designs so aren't currently considering them. I don't love the Mazda design either for some reason but see that they're always highly rated so am open to considering them.

I was surprised to see that the Jetta is actually the cheapest for what I'm looking for but then also saw they haven't had the best reviews lately so that's probably why.

I'm curious to get some other opinions on these models."

looking to set a more aggressive fan curve, The Internet says it can be set in bios but [this is the only thing I've found](https://ibb.co/xmGC2MC)

I don't even think these trip points are working. my laptop easily pushes into 88-93¬∞c and I don't hear the fans getting to full speed. I know what full speed sounds like but during gaming & benchmarks it's often not going that high. 

is this the wrong bios menu for what I want?

I'm aware I can try Dragon Center to adjust fan curve but I don't like having any unnecessary apps if possible. maybe I can set it then delete Dragon Center?

-

Edit: I made the changes in Dragon Center. it also had gaming mode on which I disabled. my fans were set to never go above 85%! and it can go to 150%, some Spinal Tap bs really. I've been fighting thermal throttling with undervolt, reduced turbo freqs, and almost ordered ptm7950, I just had to intstall this damn app to turn my fans on.. sheesh. the young guy I bought it from had this app installed (even though it had been ""factory reset"" I think he did a few things..) so it seems my laptop was running off some settings even though I had uninstalled this when I first booted up.

it also did not have discrete graphics mode enabled so it was using cpu to use integrated graphics for some tasks.. "

Roth Tax Question,fidelityinvestments,1i9u102,2025-01-25 13:54:17,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1i9u102/roth_tax_question/,Obvious-Cry-9710,,"Hello,

For year 2024, my wife and I got married. I botched the first Roth contributions that we did (I know). I‚Äôve scoured resources and was curious about the scenario:

Deposited $100 to open the account directly into a Roth IRA. Then deposited $500. Time went by, this gained about $30 in profit. I realized we were over the limit (MFS). I rechristened the entire amount to a traditional IRA. I then added $3400 to the traditional IRA. I converted this as a back door to a Roth. There is now about $4030 in the Roth IRA. We decided to pull the $3400 back out of the Roth (transferred into bank account) due to personal situations. $630 has been left in the Roth which is all technically backdoored. TurboTax is saying we owe about $340 on this money for taxes. 

Does this sound about right? I‚Äôm fine paying taxes on it. I just don‚Äôt want to leave money in there that will continue to accrue the 6% annually and am curious if I need to do  anything with the remaining $630 in the account, or can I just pay the tax bill and it‚Äôs all kosher. Thanks in advance "

1.6 to 1.8 questions,Miata,1i9txgn,2025-01-25 13:50:00,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/1i9txgn/16_to_18_questions/,TemkeF,,So I‚Äôm swapping to a 1.8 for a turbo drift car but I have poly engine mounts all gaskets for a 1.6 clutch and flywheel and trans and all accessories and I‚Äôm wondering what I need to return or I can use.
"Dash lit up like a christmas tree, any advice?",civic,1i9twzl,2025-01-25 13:49:28,1,1.0,4,https://i.redd.it/ss6uzmrlr6fe1.jpeg,bbflockin,,"Vehicle is a 2018 civic hatchback 1.5T FK7, 140k miles, battery just replaced 8 months ago, only major repair was a transmission replacement at 67k, other than that just routine maintenance. 

Got ready to leave this morning and the dash was lit up with almost every light, I stupidly did not grab a pic but it included Emissions warning, TPMS, ABS, Hill Start Assist, Brake System, Low Battery etc. Did a hard battery reset and lights were still there, drove for about 20-30 minutes and the car is functioning and sounding normally. Stopped at auto zone to get it scanned and battery checked, when turned back on all the lights were cleared and back to normal. Battery test showed a failing alternator, scanner picked up two codes P0134, and U3003-16. 

Obvious answer feels like, swap the alternator since I know that is failing, and very well could be the cause of low voltage triggering those two codes. Looking for any other input or advice, just in case this is another known issue that I am not aware of. I have seen the potential fuel injector issues but according to the scan and from driving around it does not appear to be misfiring. I appreciate any help/insight! "
