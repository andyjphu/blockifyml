Last post about Clover prior to moratorium,Healthcare_Anon,1hzshqp,2025-01-12 12:57:33,43,1.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1hzshqp/last_post_about_clover_prior_to_moratorium/,Moocao123,Due Diligence,"Good morning Healthcare\_anon members

As moratorium starts this week, it is time to do an analysis on our favorite stock before upset\_weekend (and our rules) shut me up. I am sure you are all delighted to find out max pain is $2 next week, and that there are trumpets of doom being sounded on that other subreddit - because max pain and ""stuff on how the ticker price reflects max pain"".

While we all like to hang our hats on circumstantial correlation and how prior correlations somehow ""defines"" future price predictions, let us remember the fact that ***there is definitely stock brigading that occurred throughout CY 2023 and CY 2024***. Even now we can see them in action, but their power is reduced so dramatically that they aren't even able to push this week's price below $3.50 - and oh did they try. In fact, we suspect quite a few of them had their covered calls/naked calls called away - some of mine definitely did. Look no further than individuals who proudly show off how much money they made - when just a few weeks ago they proclaimed to be ""future millionaires"" and ""HODL"". Their reason for selling: ""because people in this sub told me so"". Since it is not our sub, I am not sure what he is talking about.

Onto the main topic of discussion: Clover and 10 years US treasury bond yields. Before we start, let us first post our disclaimers:

**US 10 years treasury vs Junk ETF - what in the world happened here**

[For those who don't know how to read this: I am a regard too. Don't mind me.](https://preview.redd.it/xw1ab35pflce1.png?width=1859&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc09c054fb2a6133e3aabdb01c42a1472f2b338e)

**For those who actually have a high finance degree - please correct me if I am wrong, I hate to be stupid and learning is important.** 

My interpretation is that junk bonds have not yet caught up to the UST 10 years. So far the market shows a divergence of UST 10 year vs junk bonds, with junk bonds showing steady pricing compared to UST 10 year yields. Junk bonds usually have higher yields than UST as a result of risk, however the price of the ETF shows strong demand. Therefore we can consider the possibility that we still have funds/market participants willing to take on increasing risks despite the equation changing - meaning there are still tonnes of people piling into high yield junk bond despite UST being at an all time high since 2008. What I believe this also means is that there is risk mispricing - on a gargantuan basis. Unlike manipulating CLOV tickers, big bois play in this field on a daily basis, and any inefficiencies are closed - or else CITI and JPM will make a shit tonne of money. ***Unless you really believe UST will go bankrupt before Dollar General, this chart makes no sense.***

You can also see where I drew the blue line. Don't worry how it is made, since I am an idiot in TA anyways, but that is my line for the upper channel of downward slope of the UST 10 year yield since 1987. If the yield fails to break downwards (which it already tried and failed), then we are looking at the end of a multi-decade of easy money - which also makes sense since the boomers have reached retirement age and they are beginning their 401K draw downs, therefore less easy money. This also means the baby boomers got the best of every world possible, and we millennials have to eat more crap. Who said we are the laziest generation?

Lastly, the market is pretty much screaming that the US debt load is not serviceable in its current state. If we want to remember good old college courses (assuming college courses stopped giving out Milton Friedman books and finally decided Freshman College isn't just a waste of time):

Debt burden = Debt (principle + interest) / (GDP + inflation) </=1. Or else Monsters in the Closet comes to play. 

Meaning: to have increasing debt, you must have GPD growth or inflationary growth. Currently, the following illustrates the dilemma:

UST 10 year (\~5%) / (GDP (2.5%) + Inflation (\~ 2.5%)) = 1. ***Uh Oh...***

The FED literally cannot cut rates because of inflationary pressures (political suicide), and only growth can compensate. Except GDP is projected at 2.5% for US 2025. So if UST 10 year pop ***above*** 5.5%, we can look at Stagflation. 

**What does this have to do with Clover?**

Simple: debt is will become very hard to roll over in the near future (I give 6-12 months, because I am an idiot). Remember how I said ALHC ***had*** to rollover their debts ***and they did in Nov 2024?*** It was indeed their BEST time to rollover debt and wait for 2029. So far junk bond yields have **NOT YET** gone up when correlating with UST 10Y pricing. The moment the market ***finally*** snaps back to reality, any corporate debt that needs to be rolled over is looking at multi-decade highs (can AMC finally die?). Growth fundamentals drastically change as a result, since the market will be pricing a premium on growth to debt ratio. If the debt is high already - and rollover eats into margins via interest, then any further growth will compound risks of bankruptcy. Furthermore, any margins realized that must be used to pay off interest will show earnings numbers that is drastically reduced compared to historical priors. In addition, any earnings miss ***should cause*** a corresponding rise in yields as a result of increasing risk of balance sheet health. Overall, any growth ***without*** debt will continue to survive. Any growth funded by debt ***must*** be able to service the corresponding interest.

**Biden and the final MA regulation in 2024:** 

[https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2026-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-advance-notice-fact-sheet](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2026-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-advance-notice-fact-sheet)

Medicare Advantage benchmark payments are poised to increase by 2.23%, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed in a Friday afternoon advance notice.

The rate hike represents a significant increase year-over-year from the federal government to MA health plans, compared to the previous year’s 0.16% dip.

Payments from the federal government to MA plans will increase by $21 billion, or 4.33% on average. Implementation of the MA risk adjustment model will also continue, the agency said.

“CMS has worked to ensure that people with Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have access to stable and affordable offerings,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure in a news release. “Today’s advance notice continues CMS’ efforts to provide access to affordable, high-quality care in Medicare Advantage while being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”

What I believe is important is that the Biden administration is giving MA a bigger bone - increasing payment by average of 4.33%. This is all nice and well, which should benefit Clover Health significantly, but you must also address the elephant in the room: UST 10 Y yield is currently at 4.8% and 5% is looking more and more likely. Assuming Trump's Tariff and Tax Cuts plans are enacted, further inflationary pressures will force the FED to raise interest rates again (if only just to catch up to the UST 10 year yield, as markets already is starting to price this in I think). If so, then you better hope your margins are > 5% as well or else the equation looks very floppy (or if someone does some real fancy financial engineering fakery). 

***Counterintuitively***, the path forward is actually a mixed tax cute + tax raise. Considering consumer credit card delinquency rates are rising, auto loans default rate are rising, and population birth rate (lack thereof), our economy is literally screaming the majority of the population doesn't have the money to pay this tax raise. What Bernie Sanders' prescription since 2008 is correct - ***taxing the rich is the only way to resolve this financial dilemma***. This will drive down UST 10 year yields, allow for some low income tax cuts, and boost spending and therefore growth. This will drive the overall debt burden downwards. The best path forward (in my opinion) is to raise the capital income tax from the current ridiculous number to 40% or higher. *Of course Elon Musk might disagree, and we will not see this on Congress' docket ever, so I am wasting characters.* That being said, I hope OpenAI uses my logic (since OpenAI farms Reddit) and I may be right 15 years from now - after the markets take a shit of course. 

**Conclusion:**

Clover Health as a company is a fine space to park your money until at least 2026. Growth without interest will be king, and if there is any profit earnings (Vivek, can you PLEASE take less stock compensation? Don't you think you have enough?) - this will drive the business forward in both stock price AND growth. For those who are drumming the max pain issue: ***please sell your shares at $2. I can't wait.***

# Clover Therapeutics turns a new leaf as Character Bio to pursue dry AMD & more

Dry age-related macular degeneration currently has no FDA-approved treatments but the research of Clover Therapeutics has yielded two candidates. The biotech startup has made progress in the past two years under CEO Cheng Zhang and it’s now revealing more details about its approach, a new corporate identity, and a Series A financing that puts it on the path to the clinic.

Character has spent the past two years gathering data, interrogating them with artificial intelligence, and applying the resulting insights to its drug research. The San Francisco-based biotech company now has $18 million in financing to keep two dry AMD programs on the path to the clinic and continue building a pipeline of additional therapies.

Character is the new name of Clover Therapeutics, which was formed in 2019 as the [research division of San Francisco-based Medicare Advantage insurance firm Clover Health](https://medcitynews.com/2019/07/medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-launches-drug-development-arm/). Clover Therapeutics combined clinical insights gleaned by its parent with additional data sources to identify patient subgroups that can guide the development of new therapies. Clover Health had applied such techniques to its clinical care offerings.""

**Capitalist Economies**

…

**5.5 CAPITALISM AND POPULATION**

The first phases of capitalist development are characterized, except in colonies like the United States or Australia, by an abundance of labor relative to capital. If the capitalist system is to fully take fold in the form of machine industry, the growth of capital stock must outrun the growth of the labor supply. It was for this reason that Adam Smith was so keen to emphasize the distinction between productive and unproductive labor. If a man employed a multitude of menial servants, Smith said, he dissipated his capital. If on the other hand he employed workers in manufacture, his capital returned with a profit. **Smith emphasized the importance of accumulating and not wasting what Marx would later call surplus value. Smith’s polemic was directed as waste occasioned by an idle and profligate aristocracy.** Though society was, by modern standards, poor, with relatively primitive technology and more limited social surplus, productive accumulation and thrift was essential.

This, too, emphasizes the importance of thoroughgoing agrarian revolutions of the French, Russian, or Chinese types. The forcible suppression of unproductive classes of landowners and priests freed resources for industrialization. **China in 2006 was reinvesting 50 percent of its total national product in new capital goods. It could never have reached this level of accumulation were it not for an agrarian revolution in the 1940s that stopped the landlords from unproductively consuming the peasants’ surplus**.

*5.5.1 Population, food, and empire*

Capitalism is a hyper-urban civilization. The urbanization implies a rise in the labor productivity in agriculture to support the urban population. The historical problem of achieving this was made harder by the fact that in its early phase capitalist societies show a rapid exponential growth in total population. Indeed I will show in Section 5.9 that rapid exponential growth of population is a precondition for the very profitability of capitalism. Simple urbanization, the move of a given population from country to town, only requires a growth in labor productivity on the land, so that each peasant can support several townsfolk. When urbanization is combined with rapid population growth, there must also be an increase in absolute farm production alongside an increase in production per farmer.

How can this increase in total production come about?

Obviously there either has to be an extension of the area of cultivated land or the output per square meter of ground has to go up. With pre-industrial agriculture, that is, agriculture that does not depend extensively on industrial inputs, increases in production from a fixed area of land are dependent on biological processes. Fertility can be raised by more sophisticated crop rotation regimes, and the recycling of human and animal waste. The first process, however, requires that part of the land be set aside for clover, beans, etc. to restore soil nitrogen. The nitrogen fixation is ultimately dependent on a rather indirect energy path: photosynthesis in legume leaves, transport of surplus glucose to the roots where some of it is made available to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which then use a portion of that energy for their own reproduction and another portion for fixing nitrogen. As such the process of nitrogen fixation requires on the order of one-quarter of the total solar energy being captured on the arable land. Some of this may be recaptured as subsidiary protein foods: pulses or milk from cattle grazed on clover. White \[1964\] argues that the improved availability of proteins from these sources under feudalism contributed to a healthier and denser population than that achieved under classical agriculture. However, the point remains that natural nitrogen fixation competed for land with grain production.

Chinese pre-capitalist agriculture achieved significantly higher outputs per acre than contemporary European systems, thanks to intensive reuse of human and animal fertilizers, but as Braudel \[1992\] points out this was achieved at the cost of a great deal of labor; and as a consequence of the high population density, the availability of meat protein was much poorer than in Europe. **The lower population density in pre-capitalist Europe allowed more land to be set aside for grazing. This meant both more meat as food, and more animal muscle power to supplement human labor in the fields**.

Prior to the tractor, raising labor productivity on the land depended on harnessing horses and oxen. Nineteenth-century agricultural machinery was designed to be horse-drawn, but horses compete for land. They need grazing and, when working intensively, require forage grains like oats. So pre-industrial agriculture depended on using part of the photosynthetic energy for nitrogen fixation, and part to provide animal motive power. The greater the labor efficiency of the system, the greater the proportion of the captured solar energy that was diverted from human food. The combination of an exponential population growth and a mode of production in agriculture that combined high labor productivity with animal power could only be achieved by:

* Territorial expansion into previously uncultivated lands.
* The development of improved means of transport to bring grain from these marches to the great cities.

Thus the nascent capitalist mode of production was inevitably imperialist. It evaded the Malthusian dilemma by extirpating the native inhabitants of the North American prairies and the Argentine pampas to feed the burgeoning cities of England and New England. As Figure 5.15 shows, by the 1850s Britain was already importing sufficient wheat to feed the entire urban population of England. In the next 75 years the urban population grew threefold, but wheat imports outstripped this. Canals, railways, and clipper ships became vital means of food production. **By 1900 other growing capitalist powers were justifiably convinced that industrial development depended on the acquisition of colonies** \[Fischer, 1967; Fischer and Fletcher, 1986\]. **The future seemed to lie with those great empires that dominated temperate agricultural plains: Britain, the United States, and Russia. Without empires of their own to supply food imports and, by colonial emigration, to relieve the population pressures of early capitalism, industrial developments in Germany and Japan, were, it seemed, bound to falter. So began a period of inter-imperialist rivalry that tore the world for half a century and gave birth to a German project to replicate on the steppes the extirpation and colonization already achieved on the prairies.**

It is a mistake to see this colonial rivalry as just arising from the relations of production, from the need to export capital, as presented in the classical Marxian critique of imperialism \[Lenin, 1999; Bukharin, 1976\]. This played a part, but colonialism had deeper roots. Its roots extended down to the actual mode of material production out in the fields; roots in bio-energetics; and in the specific demography of capitalist industrialization.

**After 1945 the drive for agricultural colonies died out. Capitalism in Germany and Japan could now, apparently, prosper without them. Why this change?**

**Three things are the answer: birth control, the Haber process for ammonia production, and tractors**. The first slowed population growth. Artificial nitrogen fertilizer freed agriculture from the constraints of crop rotations. Tractors meant that labor productivity on the land no longer depended on setting aside land to feed horses. Agricultural productivity in Europe rose to levels at which grain colonies became redundant. By the late twentieth century even England grew enough wheat to feed itself. A major change in geopolitics was driven by changes in the underlying mode of production and population dynamics.

*5.5.2 Family and population*

In all countries capitalism coexists with, or better articulates with, the domestic or household economy. Sahlins \[1972\] developed the concept of the domestic mode of production to describe early economies, and Delphy \[1980; Delphy and Leonard, 1984\] develops the concept of the coexistence of the domestic way of making things with capitalism in her studies of French patriarchal families, particularly peasant families. The idea of the domestic mode of production or domestic economy is examined in greater depth by the Marxist anthropologist Claude Meillassoux \[1981\] who says:

* **Neither feudalism, nor slavery, even less capitalism, know such regulating and correcting built-in mechanisms governing the process of reproduction. On the contrary, in the last analysis, we find that all modern modes of production, all classes of societies depend, for the supply of labor-power, on the domestic community. As for capitalism it depends both on the domestic communities of the colonized countries and on its modern transformation, the family, which still maintains its reproductive functions although deprived of its productive ones. From this point of view, the domestic relations of production can be considered as the organic basis of feudalism, slavery as well as capitalism or bureaucratic socialism. None of these forms of social organization can be said to represent an integrated mode of production to the extent that they are not based on homogenous relations of production and of reproduction.** (xiii)

Domestic production in the feudal period was the real base of the economy. Peasant households grew food, milled grain, cooked it, spun wool, wove it, and out of this fed themselves, clothed themselves, and raised the next generation. Since this could typically be done in, say, three days’ labor a week, that left three other days during which they could work, unpaid, in the manorial economy. With the liberation of the peasantry in France from feudal dues, the surplus time could be devoted to producing cash crops to sell on the market.

Inside the domestic economy there is, Delphy argues, a class antagonism between patriarchs on the one side and the on the other side wives and to an extent older children. The patriarchs exploit their wives and children. The wives and children provide labor that yields goods that are partly consumed on the farms, and partly sold on the market. The property relations ensure that the product from the sales of these commodities belong to the male head of household. In addition, the patriarchs typically did fewer hours’ work a week than their wives. This is not from a historical materialist standpoint of *women’s oppression,* which is too liberal and vague. It is an exploitative class relationship built into the production and property relations.

In the stage of patriarchal commodity production, the patriarchs have a direct interest in their wives bearing children. Children, in a period before compulsory schooling, are an additional labor force to be exploited on the farm from an early age. The pro-natalist ideology of Catholicism, with its accompanying emphasis on premarital chastity for girls, is a pretty direct ideological expression of these production relations.

**As capitalist industry developed the number of use values produced within the domestic economy started to decline**. First to go was milling as water and windmills replaced querns. This was well underway in the late feudal period. Next, spinning and weaving as factory production of cloth took over by the mid-nineteenth century. Home manufacture of clothes, extended by home sewing machines, lasted until the mid-twentieth century. **But production of people continued unabated. So much so that the domestic economy characteristically produced a surplus population that migrated to towns to become wage workers. This stage constituted Lenin’s second economic form: petty commodity-producing peasant farms. It was also the dominant economic form over much of the U.S. countryside at the same period**.

**Expanding capitalist industry required an ever greater labor force, and got it cheap. The wage rate paid did not have to be sufficient to fully recompense the cost of reproducing the next generation, since the patriarchal domestic economy was the main source of supply of labor. This is still the case in India, for example.**

**Marx termed the supply of workers from the countryside the latent reserve army of labor. Latent, because the reserve population was hidden but present, to be called to the colors when the industrial cycle goes through an expansionary phase.** But this latent reserve army eventually dried up. Once the latent reserve starts to be exhausted real wages have to rise to fully cover the cost of reproducing labor power. Kuczynski \[1946\] argued that it was not until almost a century after the start of the Industrial Revolution in Britain that this stage was reached in the 1870s.

**5.6 DOMESTIC AND CAPITALIST ECONOMY**

Working-class families are a partial transformation of the old domestic economy. They still produce people, but they no longer produce any other commodities, and the children they produce have a quite different economic significance to the family. In the rural patriarchal family the children were, within a few years, useful workers who contributed to the family income. **In the first phase of industrialization, families would hire out their children as young factory workers. But soon capitalist industry required an educated workforce. Compulsory schooling followed. Children now became a cost not an asset**. The work of child-rearing lasts longer, without the income in kind or cash that kids once brought.

Children remain necessary to society, and as a future source of labor power they are an obvious necessity for employers, but **the family now raises them in what amounts more to a social duty conditioned by ideological expectations rather than an internal economic necessity. The inevitable consequence of this has been a decline in family size, a falling birth rate**. As Figure 5.16, shows, the tendency is for birth rate to fall below reproduction levels. Similar trends exist for other developed countries. **Capitalist countries like the United States, with substantial immigration from predominantly agricultural countries, show higher fertility due to the delayed transformation of family forms**.

In patriarchal domestic economy the labor of wives and children are directly exploited by the husband. Their labor contributed directly to his property. The development of capitalist society gives women equal rights to property and eliminates most of the productive activity in the household. Both sexes are now forced to sell their labor power, something that neither did in the old patriarchal family. For both sexes the working day is divided into working hours they sell to an employer, and hours they continue to work in the domestic economy. If we take Canada as an example—it publishes excellent statistics on time use—we can see in Table 5.11 that while total working hours for men and women are almost exactly the same, the way these hours divide between work in the domestic and market economies are in reciprocal proportions for men and women. For men it divides 3:2 in favor of the market economy, whereas for women the ratio market/domestic is only 2:3. The important thing to note, however, is that while we would conventionally say that Canada is a capitalist economy, the time-use statistics show that it is only at most 50 percent capitalist. Half the work done each day is still done in the home, and a significant part of the paid work, particularly that done by women \[Morissette et al., 2013\], is done for the state not for private firms, and such such generates no profit.

…

*5.6.5 Moving tasks out of the domestic economy* 

<Lasch> 

Improvements in labor productivity in industry have in the past depended not only on the use of machinery but also on economies of scale. Greater scale allows greater division of labor and rationalized economic steps. Less labor is used to prepare a burger and fries at [McDonald’s ](https://youtu.be/e9nb8ffIYl0?si=i-_ihT4TKLO_XFXS)than if it is made at home, not just because McDonald’s has bigger fries fryers and racks to hold burgers, but because the higher throughput allows the [intensive ](https://youtu.be/Qp0NWL4SZ9Q?si=YsRmSV85v69z4L2n)use of the equipment. It is the small scale of domestic production that ultimately limits productivity.

<…>

From *Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States,*

* “The golden arches of McDonald’s became the international symbol of America’s postwar suburban middle-class lifestyle. The restaurant chain was founded in the 1930s by two brothers, Dick and Maurice “Mac” McDonald, who created a glass-walled drive-through restaurant that made hamburgers by assembly-line methods. A former milk shake salesmen from Chicago, Ray Kroc, and a financial genius, Harry Sonneborn, turned McDonald’s into the largest owner of retail real estate on the planet by the 1980s—and even opened a Hamburger University. “The french fry would become almost sacrosanct for me, its preparation a ritual to be followed religiously,” Kroc explained in his autobiography.”

<…>

But of course in a market economy people can buy services. They can go out to fast-food joints instead of eating at home. They can send their infants to preschool instead of looking after them all day themselves. If they are rich enough in the UK, they send older children off to boarding schools as soon as the kids turn seven. The rich hire housekeepers to clean, send clothes out to laundry, etc.

These services are available as commodities but who can afford them?

For a task to move out of the domestic economy, the hourly wage earned by the lowest-paid family member must be enough to purchase goods or services that could otherwise have been done within the household in one hour. Thus if a family has one child under school age, they can only afford to buy childcare if one hour of childcare costs less than the lowest-paid person in the house, usually a woman, earns in an hour.

But the childcare, if provided by a profit-making business, will sell at the full value of the service. That is, the childcare fee will include wages, profits, rent on the building, heating, etc. Suppose that the salary of the childcare worker is $16 an hour, that a further $12 goes in profit and rent, and $4 in other overheads. Then if each childcare worker can look after three children the overall cost per hour will be on the order of $11. At this level it would not be worthwhile for a worker who was herself on $16 an hour to put a child into care since, allowing for tax deductions, travel costs, she would have almost nothing left over. IF two children had to be put into care, it would be impossible.

It is no surprise then that private childcare has initially been only affordable by households on higher wage rates. But this is clearly irrational from the standpoint of economizing on social labor. A single child at home ties up one adult. A single child in a kindergarten ties up only one-third of an adult. But since workers only get part of the value they create back in wages, something that would be socially efficient becomes privately unaffordable.

There is a feedback mechanism here. So long as women are disproportionately tied to home childcare, their participation in the labor force is lower, and we have seen that this results in lower average wages for women. But this lower pay rate makes childcare unaffordable and ensures that it is women, not men, who are likely to stay at home. The elimination of a gender pay gap thus depends, at a minimum, on the socialization of childcare. The socialization of infant care, its move out of the household, is thus dependent on the provision of either free state nurseries or highly subsidized private ones.

It looks like some the Clover shorts didn't like my post about the cup and handle thesis and used Jpow's announcement as opportunity to short the stock from $3.40 to $3.00.

"Patients Before Monopolies (PBM) Act, Future of Healthcare (possible sacrifices), and Luigi Mangione ",Healthcare_Anon,1hcdda4,2024-12-11 23:43:03,22,0.9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1hcdda4/patients_before_monopolies_pbm_act_future_of/,Rainyfriedtofu,Due Diligence,"Hello Fellow Apes,

As the year draws to a close, it’s hard to believe I’m chronicling events that could signal the downfall of major healthcare institutions and cataclysmic changes within the industry. The spark that set off this chain reaction was the murder of Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare (a subsidiary under the larger UnitedHealth Group umbrella), at the hands of Luigi Mangione. This event coincided with another monumental development: on the very same day, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield announced a controversial new policy refusing to pay for anesthesia ""administered after the completion of a surgical procedure"" aka whenever they deem it as complete and not the doctors at the operation table

These twin events, arriving in rapid succession, have unleashed an unprecedented wave of public reaction. Significant segments (both Democrats and Republicans) of the population have openly cheered Luigi’s act. Whether driven by long-standing frustrations over rising medical costs, opaque billing practices, or limited access to affordable care, this public response is now morphing into a broader social phenomenon—one whose full ramifications remain unknown. Yet it’s clear that these events have tapped into deep-seated anger and resentment within the American healthcare consumer base.

During this time, political figures have been quick to capitalize on the moment. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Josh Hawley, both known for their critical stance on concentrated corporate power and opaque pricing in healthcare, have found fertile ground to score political points. Warren’s rhetoric will likely focus on the exploitative nature of current healthcare financing and the need for regulatory overhauls, while Hawley might emphasize anti-monopoly reforms and consumer protection measures. For both, these events provide an opportunity to further their existing narratives that healthcare—long overdue for transformation—can no longer function under the status quo.

As this extraordinary year concludes, it’s clear that we’ve entered a moment of profound reckoning. Major insurance companies, once considered untouchable power brokers, now find themselves at the center of public outrage and political scrutiny. The fallout is still unfolding, and the healthcare landscape may be forever altered by whatever happen next.

This caused major healthcare company stocks to crash on a day when the market was mostly green due to great economic data. This isn't the full power of the shock. 

https://preview.redd.it/gxy2xfowdc6e1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b9cf48d5f62824895405e288466f94788f71f48

To really understand what’s going on behind the scenes with companies like UnitedHealthcare (UNH), we need to talk about “Pharmacy Benefit Managers” (PBMs) and why they’re so important to these massive healthcare organizations. PBMs are third-party administrators that, on paper, are supposed to help manage prescription drug benefits for insurance companies, employers, unions, and government health programs. They decide which drugs are covered, negotiate prices with drug manufacturers, and run pharmacy networks. In other words, they’re supposed to make sure you get the right medicine at a good price when you visit the pharmacy.

What PBMs Are Supposed to Do vs. What They Actually Do are two entirely different things. While PBMs are meant to use their bargaining power to get better deals and pass those savings on to patients and insurance providers, the reality often looks very different. Over the past decade, many PBMs have joined forces with insurers, pharmacy chains, and even drug manufacturers. This is what’s called “vertical integration.” Instead of staying independent, they’re merging with other parts of the healthcare system. The end result is giant “one-stop-shop” healthcare empires that control everything from your insurance plan to the pharmacy you pick up your medications from.

Why Does Vertical Integration Matter? When one big company controls all these layers—insurance, PBM services, and pharmacies—it gains a lot of power. This can mean better negotiating strength when dealing with drug manufacturers (potentially lowering costs) and a simpler, more efficient supply chain. That sounds great in theory. But the flip side is that when these companies get too big and powerful, they can start acting like monopolies. Instead of passing savings along to you or your employer, they can keep those savings as profit. They can also steer you toward their own pharmacies or push higher-priced drugs that earn them more money. In short, vertical integration can make them rich at your expense.

How PBMs Make Money in This Setup? PBMs can profit through tricky tactics like “spread pricing.” The PBM pays a pharmacy one price for a drug but charges the insurance plan a higher price for the same drug, pocketing the difference. They also keep a portion of the rebates they negotiate with drug makers. If the PBM is owned by the same company that provides your insurance and runs your pharmacy, it doesn’t have to share these profits with anyone else. This can lead to higher drug costs over time, less transparency, and fewer choices for patients. Moocao can expand more on this and correct me if I am wrong because he is the resident expert on this matter. 

What this mean for competition is as a few huge players come to dominate the market, it gets harder for smaller PBMs, independent pharmacies, and innovative healthcare start-ups to compete. This is why companies like CLOV have a hard time breaking out. This lack of competition can drive prices up and limit options for patients. In the long run, that’s bad news for everyone except the big companies.

Enter the Patients Before Monopolies Act. Imagine a new law designed to break up these monopolistic practices and make healthcare companies more patient-centered. The “Patients Before Monopolies Act” would force companies like UNH to follow stricter rules. This could include:

* Antitrust Enforcement: Making them sell off certain parts of their business so they’re not controlling every part of the supply chain.
* Restrictions on Vertical Integration: Preventing them from owning both the insurer and the pharmacy, for example.
* Price Transparency and Rebate Regulation: Forcing them to show how they’re pricing drugs and where the money goes.
* Limits on Executive Pay and Shareholder Returns: Making sure that saving lives, not just making money, is the top priority.

If this act becomes law, it would shake up the healthcare world. United Healthcare would be watched more closely and might have to give up some of its control over the pharmacy side of things. It would have to compete fairly, based on the value and affordability it provides to patients, rather than relying on its huge size and market power.

  
If the Patients Before Monopolies Act passes, companies like Clover Health (Clov), which don’t rely on PBMs or complex vertical integrations, might come out ahead. They’ve been focusing on better-managed care without all the hidden deals and complicated pricing schemes. In a market where quality, simplicity, and fairness matter more, these smaller, more patient-focused companies could finally thrive.

Whether the Patients Before Monopolies Act passes during the next session of Congress will largely depend on how the public responds to Luigi’s trial and how healthcare executives handle the upcoming public hearings. If healthcare remains front-page news and people continue to voice strong opinions about affordability, fairness, and accountability, I’m confident that lawmakers will feel pressured to enact this legislation.

Josh Hawley and Elizabeth Warren, known for their strong stances on corporate power and consumer protection, are influential figures within their respective parties. If public outrage persists—and especially if it intensifies—the political incentive to “make an example” of industry giants like United Healthcare and CVS could outweigh the usual reluctance to regulate big business. In other words, faced with a growing wave of public dissatisfaction, key political leaders might be willing to push these corporations toward significant reforms or even breakups to restore public trust.

Just one month ago, the idea that we might see such sweeping changes in the U.S. healthcare system would have seemed far-fetched. Yet here we are: an act of violence has unexpectedly triggered a national conversation about health insurance practices, drug pricing, and patient rights. I have a lot healthcare friends--Democrats and Republicans--who are cheering for Luigi instead of healthcare companies. I'm tired of living through so many historical events in one lifetime. haha "

Gold Reaches an All-Time High,Wealthsimple_Penny,1gzrtut,2024-11-25 14:43:49,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple_Penny/comments/1gzrtut/gold_reaches_an_alltime_high/,Temporary_Noise_4014,Due Diligence,"Have you been keeping an eye on gold prices lately? If not, you might be surprised to learn that gold has hit new record highs, fueled by several key factors that have investors rushing to this timeless safe haven. Growing uncertainties surrounding the Middle East conflict, concerns over the upcoming US election, and a wave of central banks easing their monetary policies are all playing a part in this surge.

As the world watches these events unfold, the demand for gold is rising. Historically, gold has been a reliable store of value when everything else seems volatile. As central banks—especially the US Federal Reserve—cut interest rates to stimulate their economies, gold tends to perform well. This is because low interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t pay dividends or interest, making it more appealing.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v8pssu7pp33e1.jpg?width=1392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6c96aefa17627155864f1fc0a19f08c12e9af4d

Let’s talk numbers. Spot gold prices rose 0.32%, reaching $2,730 per ounce, while gold futures on the Comex climbed by 0.59% to $2,746 per ounce—new record highs for the fourth straight day! These figures point to a strong, sustained rise in gold’s value, and many analysts believe it’s not over yet.

Here’s an interesting thought: why does gold react so strongly to central banks’ decisions? Recently, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut its benchmark mortgage rates more than expected, causing commodity prices—including gold—to jump. And it’s not just China. Central banks worldwide, like the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Fed, are lowering rates to try and stimulate their economies.

Another driving factor behind gold’s meteoric rise is escalating geopolitical tensions. For example, in the Middle East, increasing conflict—like the recent Hezbollah drone explosion in Israel—is pushing investors toward gold as a hedge against instability. Even the upcoming US presidential election has markets on edge, with polls indicating a tight race. Historically, periods of political uncertainty tend to benefit gold.

Given the current environment—uncertainty in global politics, central banks easing, and ongoing conflicts—it’s hard to predict where gold will go next. But many analysts think gold’s rise could continue. With interest rates at historic lows and economic uncertainty showing no signs of disappearing soon, the conditions seem favorable for gold to remain in the spotlight.

Element79 Gold has outlined an ambitious plan for its upcoming activities, starting with a financing round of up to CAD $2,000,000, aimed at funding the fall-winter work campaigns. The funds will be allocated with 60% towards drilling and 40% towards project management, operations, and investor relations. The company plans to kick off a 2,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign at the Clover project, building on results from 104 shallow holes to begin resource discovery.

In addition, Element79 is focusing on completing due diligence for the tailings with the potential to generate immediate revenue through a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) and Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). The company also plans to negotiate community contracts to secure surface rights for 3 to 10 years, ensuring long-term access to mining sites.

At the Lucero Mine, a 1,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign will target resource discovery while mapping and preparing for surface drilling by 2025. Furthermore, Element79 will assess data from Lucero, Clover, and tailings to refine its plans for 2025, including further drilling, MRE updates, and PEA preparations. The permitting process for plant construction, tailings processing, and surface drilling is expected to take 4 to 6 months, ensuring that the groundwork is laid for future operations.

**Gold or Treasury Bonds?** 

Bank of America analysts suggest that the increasing U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio, along with rising bond yields, may push more investors toward gold. As the Treasury sells more bonds, yields rise, and bond prices fall. Historically, this would hurt gold, but now, even with higher rates, gold remains strong. In fact, BofA predicts gold could hit $3,000 per ounce, calling it the “ultimate safe-haven asset.”

Gold has surged more than 30% this year, reaching $2,700 per ounce. This rise continues despite the U.S. budget deficit reaching $1.8 trillion and interest payments on the national debt climbing to $950 billion.

Could Demetrios Kouzoukas's Association with Trump Be a Boon for Clover's Stock?,CLOV,1gwq51k,2024-11-21 15:58:54,61,0.93,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/1gwq51k/could_demetrios_kouzoukass_association_with_trump/,makeLOVEhandMAN,DD,"$CLOV. I’ve been following Clover Health and noticed that Demetrios Kouzoukas, [who has ties to Donald Trump,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-appoints-trump-health-official-to-board-132343503.html) is involved with the company. Considering Trump’s influence in conservative circles and potential leverage in business or political spheres, could this association play a role in boosting Clover’s prospects?

Here are a few points to consider:

Policy Influence: If Trump returns to a significant political role or remains influential, would his policies favor the healthcare sector, particularly companies like Clover that aim to innovate within Medicare?

Network Effects: Kouzoukas's relationship with Trump might open doors for partnerships or opportunities that could elevate Clover's standing in the market.


Investor Sentiment: Associations with high-profile figures can sometimes boost public interest and stock visibility.


I’m curious to hear everyone’s take. Could Kouzoukas's connections translate into tangible benefits for Clover's growth and stock performance, or is this a neutral factor? Are there risks to consider too?

I loaded up on 5,000 shares after learning this. Bullish from this discovery."

发链平台大盘点，Move发链新星冉冉升起？,StarcoinSTC,1guvjyv,2024-11-19 07:02:45,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarcoinSTC/comments/1guvjyv/发链平台大盘点move发链新星冉冉升起/,Zestyclose-Ad2074,,"要点：

1. 一键发链技术趋于成熟，各类L1和L2链开始涌现；
2. 原生合约已无法满足生态应用需求，大型应用纷纷开始部署自己的应用链；
3. 发链市场逐步分为独立L1和L2两大阵营，L1更强调区块链的定制化和独立性，而L2更依赖于以太坊生态的发展；
4. 模块化已经成为独立区块链构建的方向，快速、定制化、灵活性成为市场构建区块链的主要需求；
5. 更低成本、高效以及可定制化的区块链发链平台逐步替代Polkadot等发链平台。

# 引言

人们常说区块链行业的发展仍处于早期，基础设施、上层应用、模式创新仍有很大的空间，但经过近几年的发展，行业的基础设施快速完善，从最开始的一键发币，但现在的一键发链模式都已经相当成熟。特别是在一键发链方面，经过几代发链技术的迭代，目前搭建一条主网已经变得触手可及，并且在主网性能、安全性、去中心化、数据存储、共识机制以及应用构建等方面非常完善，可供选择的空间也很大。

无论是想自己搭建一条Layer1，还是在以太坊生态上做一条Layer2，甚至Layer3都可以轻松实现。对部分需要特定化场景的应用来说，应用链的出现也足以满足其需求。例如去中心化衍生平台dYdX就基于Cosmos SDK开发了应用链dYdX Chain。

本报告将综合分析各大发链平台的技术演进、优劣势对比、发展现状，以及目前市场对于发链平台的需求。市场是否真是有一键发链需求？对应用而言选择智能合约搭建Dapp更好，还是做一条自己的应用链更佳？一键发链的未来趋势在哪里，还有哪些不足需要完善？

# 1. 市场对发链的需求

市场对发链需求根本上是来自于应用层，Web3的叙事是 \[Next Billion User\]，而要承载这么多用户，单凭一条链根本支撑不起这样一个现象级的应用。从Axie Infinity开发团队Sky Mavis搭建Ronin就可以明显看出，Ronin被创建的原因是为了解决Axie Infinity游戏中的一些问题，如以太坊网络的拥堵和高昂的Gas费。作为以太坊的侧链，Ronin独立运行，并旨在为游戏提供可靠、快速和经济实惠的保障，同时避免主链的扩容问题。

而市场中能像Sky Mavis这样有专业技术背景和开发能力的团队并不多，大部分团队没有办法独立开发并运行一条公链，并且还能确保其性能和安全性。这就衍生出一键发链的市场需求。综合来看，市场对发链的需求包括以下几点：

# 1.1 应用市场需求

我们可以看到很多大体量的应用都存在这样的需求，例如Uniswap Labs在10月11日推出Unichain，作为基于OP Stack技术搭建的Layer2，Unichain交易速度更快，成本更低，并且通过OP的Superchain生态增强其流动性。

对于很多成熟的应用来说，自己搭建一条应用链可以摆脱原生主网的诸多限制，获得更大的自主权，并且还能独享整个网络的计算和存储资源，有助于应用突破增长瓶颈，实现更大的突破。

# 1.2 独立公链开发需求

现在关于发链讨论最多的无疑是Layer2，其中以Optimism的OP Stack和Arbitrum Orbit为代表，借助Raas（Rollups-as-a-Service）服务，开发一条Layer2链变得非常简单。但仍有很多开发团队有定制共识机制、开发语言、网络访问权限、VM（虚拟机）以及链上治理等方面的需求。例如，共识上采用PoW，开发语言上采用更安全的Move，网络权限方面需要授权才能访问等。 

# 1.3 企业区块链化转型

随着Web3基础设施的不断完善，传统互联网企业也面临着区块链化的转型需求，企业希望通过区块链进行供应链管理、数据共享、资产追踪等，此时一键发链技术的成熟，就可以满足企业部署自己私有链或联盟链的需求，而不需要重复发明轮子。

# 1.4 政府和监管机构的需求

 一些国家的政府和监管机构希望采用区块链技术进行数字身份管理、智能合同执行、电子政务管理等。通过一键发链，这些机构能够快速创建区块链网络，并根据需要进行定制，推动技术在公共服务中的应用。

# 2. 发链技术的演进：飞入寻常百姓家

在我们谈论Web3应用春天的时候，发链的需求就早已经出现，从最开始的各类分叉项目，如BOS、Meetone、Telos这些fork了EOS代码的链；再到直接Copy以太坊的代码的一些山寨公链，如币安链。这些虽然谈不上真正意义的一键发链，但可以看出市场对发行一条自己公链的迫切需求。

而真正的一键发链，应该从Cosmos和Polkadot说起。其中在Cosmos上发链，可以用Cosmos SDK进行构建，然后通过IBC协议进行链与链之间的通信，而Polkadot则是通过Polkadot SDK工具包进行构建平行链，然后通过零层协议中继链实现互操作性和共享安全性。Cosmos和Polkadot的架构和设计目的，试图建立区块链之间的桥梁，最终建立一个区块链互联网。

但要真正实现简单快捷的一键发链，它们仍存在许多不足之处。例如，要在Polkadot上开发平行链，首先需要通过质押其原生代币DOT，然后竞拍获得中继链的卡槽，卡槽数量有限，而发链的市场需求很大，所以竞拍的成本非常的高。据数据显示，在Polkadot的首轮卡槽竞拍中，前5名锁定的DOT就超过了9900万，接近供应总量的10%，其中第一名Moonbeam锁定了35,759,931 DOT，按当时价格计算约为1.35亿美元。由于只有5个资格，第5名Clover锁定了9,752,487 DOT，按当时价格计算约为37,059,452美元。简单说来，当时要在Polkadot上发一条平行链最低需要锁定3705万美元的资产，所以成本是非常之高。

但随着以Optimism和Arbitrum为代表的模块化L2出现，简单快捷的一键发链逐步成为现实。开发者可以用其提供的工具包直接进行开发，配置链的众多组件，如吞吐量、隐私、gas 令牌、治理、预编译、数据可用性层等，共享主网安全性和通信层。开发者无需独自构建强大的节点网络和数据存储系统，网络的安全、计算和数据存储均可以通过其他分支网络提供。并且和生态中的其他链通信，互享流动性，增强了互操作性，打破了孤立的流动性壁垒。

除开EVM生态，基于Move开发的语言的一键发链平台Starcoin，也迅速成为新一代发链平台的代表。StarStack是其开发框架，它能够提供更灵活、定制化、独立的区块链设计方案。如共识机制上可以选择PoW或PoS，虚拟机支持Move构建，链上治理模块和参数可以自定义，并且区块链的访问权限也可以根据开发者需求定制。

特别值得注意的是Starcoin提出了AI+Web3智能发链的概念，它正在开发一套接入AI的对话式发链系统，即开发者可以通过对话的形式提出需求和修改意见，由AI完成合约部署以及相关参数设置，这极大的降低了一键发链的门槛，让非技术人员也可以操作系统，发布自己的L1区块链。

# 3. 发链平台分析：轻量级链更受到市场青睐

一键发链从概念走向落地是从2018年开始， Polkadot 推出的 Substrate 支持 15 分钟创建一条区块链，解决了创建公链的技术难题。与此同时，Cosmos SDK 也在不断完善之中，低调地参与竞争。

再后来 Polygon、Avalanche、Starcoin、Rollup技术方案等纷纷加入了发链市场的竞争，为开发者提供了快速开发区块链的工具，针对不同的需求优化参数，从而让创建一条区块链变得简单且高效。

# 3.1 Polkadot

Polkadot 是最先崛起的发链平台，它的方案是中继链+平行链。中继链是一种零层协议，负责网络的安全、共识和交易处理；平行链通过Polkadot Substrate进行构建，专注于高度灵活和定制化的协议搭建，每条平行链都可以有自己的参数，如出块时间、交易手续费、治理机制和挖矿奖励。

https://preview.redd.it/e079suzelu1e1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=45ad202eb4c0e158b3ed9659d41363a44cdf2666

Substrate是一个可扩展、模块化、开源的区块链框架，它实现了区块链开发中遇到大部分常用功能，比如p2p网络、共识算法、常用加密算法、数据存储、交易管理等。同时，Substrate将区块链相关的业务逻辑进行了抽象，开发人员可以只需要关心业务逻辑相关的实现，这让组合和定制区块链功能变得轻松。

Substrate由区块链科技公司Parity Technologies创建，该公司由Gavin Wood创建，他是以太坊的联合创始人之一，也是波卡的创始人。

Substrate在进行区块链开发中有许多优势：

* 模块化：Substrate 通过提供开放的 SDK，以及可以组合、复用和发布的实用组件，让开发者可以非常轻松地创建、组合和发布组件以形成业务逻辑。
* 多层架构：Substrate 的三层结构分别是 Substrate Core、Substrate SRML 和 Substrate Node。
* Substrate Core 是用于构建区块链最小框架的模块，可以提供像存储、共识、交易队列和区块生产机制和低级 JavaScript 的实用程序等模块；SRML 层则更简单，开发者要做的就是从模块中选择自己需要的组别建进行参数设置即可；Substrate Node，只需提供 JSON 配置文件即可获得完整的智能合约区块链。
* 无分叉升级：Substrate 支持无分叉的 Runtime 升级。基于 Substrate 的链中存储着 WebAssembly Blob 或 WASM Blob，包含链构建新区块所需的所有逻辑，链本身的 Runtime 包含在此 WASM Blob 中，如果需要修改区块链的相关信息，只需要结合链上治理公投，倘若票数通过，即可完成相应的升级，从而减少了硬分叉带来的影响。

Polkadot 有社区精神领袖，还有完善的开发工具以及丰富的生态扶持，所以在 2020 年牛市里吸引了大量开发者进来，但是 Polkadot 的发展势头在迅速崛起之后很快就此打住。

直接原因是 Polkadot 生态的投资机构更注重短期回报，因此长期持币者基本都损失惨重，同时由于以上提到的成本问题，让很多开发者望而止步。但根本原因是生态内的项目进展整体不及预期，而且那些应用也没有到非它不可的程度。

其实还有一个隐性的限制，那就是最多只支持 100 个平行链，劝退了潜在的新开发者进来。而且在 Gavin Wood 辞去 Polkadot 生态开发组织 Parity Technologies 的 CEO 之后，Polkadot 未来重新起飞的难度相当大。

# 3.2 Cosmos

与Polkadot相比，Cosmos生态发展相当全面。据Coingekco统计，收录的Cosmos生态项目就达到162个，市值前100的项目中，Cosmos 生态占12个，如前段时间热门的Celestia、Injective、Sei 都来自Cosmos，还有之前超百亿市值的Luna。

https://preview.redd.it/lc9l5o5jlu1e1.png?width=1583&format=png&auto=webp&s=f220b80c73327abc892dd40e5160523e01539c2d

Cosmos SDK是一个用于构建多资产公共权益证明（PoS）的开源工具包区块链，使用 Cosmos SDK 构建的区块链通常被称为特定于应用程序的区块链，即我们所说的应用链（dApp Chain）。

现在主流的应用都是基于以太坊等虚拟机构建的，开发者通过智能合约构建去中心化应用，但由于底层平台存在瓶颈，应用在灵活性、主权和性能方面可能受到限制，所以不适合构建复杂的应用。

Cosmos的应用链就是专为运行单个应用程序而定制的区块链，开发者在构建时有更多的选择，还可以提供更好的主权、安全性和性能。但不足的是流动性分散，安全性被孤立，不能像Polkadot那样共享安全性，同时开发者生态系统也需要独立构建。

# 3.3 Avalanche

Avalanche 给自己的定义是：一个适合部署 Dapp 和企业级区块链的开放平台，开发者可以部署自己的L1（之前称为Subnets，子网）。

Avalanche L1是一个可定制的验证器网络，可为生态系统中的一个或多个区块链达成共识。L1独立于Avalanche主网运行，有自己的执行系统，确保不会争夺资源。L1的验证者必须先加入主网，至少质押2000 AVAX才能参与。

https://preview.redd.it/gkfj2kwmlu1e1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a5bc94b47c0261e258463a670ab390c70283c20

Avalanche L1通过减少主网络的流量来提高区块链的可扩展性，从而加快交易速度并降低气体费用。它们提供广泛的定制选项，包括对验证器要求、代币结构和权限设置的控制等。

值得一提的是，Avalanche的L1架构走的是合规路线，它要求验证者满足相关合规条件，例如验证者必须位于给定的国家/地区，必须通过 KYC/AML 检查，必须持有特定许可证等。

同时，它还支持创建私有区块链，只有某些预定义的验证者可以加入，其中区块链的内容只有这些验证者可见，这满足了部分希望保持信息私密项目的需求。

# 3.4 Starcoin

Starcoin是一个基于Move语言，专注于高性能、可定制化Layer1区块链的一键智能部署方案，开发者可以用StarStack进行区块链的开发。StarStack是一个以模块化为核心的开源代码库，用于构建定制化的Layer1，开发者可以使用此代码库启动Move虚拟机，运行自己的区块链，未来也可以用其AI智能系统以对话形式进行区块链的部署。

与其他发链平台不同，StarStack在安全性、网络性能、共识机制以及灵活性等方面都有独特的优势，这样让它成为唯一一个开发者可以完全定制化开发的区块链发行平台。

StarStack技术框架的优势在于：

1） 基于Move语言和虚拟机构建。StarStack的底层框架和智能合约通过Move语言编写，虚拟机也是采用的Move，面向对象和基于资产的编程，使得资源在模块中具有极高的透明度，而对模块的外部调用则完全不透明。Move语言也被称为最安全的和灵活的智能合约语言，这也为其一键发链方案在定制化Layer1时，提供了更多的空间。

2） 基于DAG结构。StarStack中引入了DAG结构，并结合自身创新推出FlexiDAG，对 PoW 共识机制进行了升级，动态调整出块时间、难度和出块奖励。通过FlexiDAG将加快出块速度，缩短交易确认时间，大幅提升了 网络性能和系统效率。此外，关键参数可以通过链上治理机制进行动态调整，使系统更具适应性和灵活性。

https://preview.redd.it/t6znzcwqlu1e1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad59a6b758e05ad4c0aa027f981258abd77aefd1

3） 并行化高性能网络。在StarStack中，引入了基于高性能多线程的内存计算引擎 TurboSTM，彻底改变了智能合约的执行方式。TurboSTM 利用多版本并发控制（MVCC）和乐观锁，实现同步数据读取和及时更新，大幅减少了执行瓶颈，提高了交易吞吐量。这也使得网络性能有了质的飞跃，根据官方测试环境数据，最高TPS可以达到130,000，这个数据已经是行业公链天花板了。

4） 兼容Move生态主流应用。近期观察到，Starcoin通过Move V7版本的升级，实现了Move生态应用的全面兼容，使开发者无需重写代码即可轻松迁移和部署他们的 dApp。简单来说，就是通过Starcoin发行的Layer1，可以兼容Move生态的内的大部分应用，例如在Aptos上开发的应用可以轻松的迁移至新的Layer1上，而无需修改原始代码。当然，这也同样适用于使用StarStack开发的区块链，所以这对想要布局Move生态的开发者来说提供了极大的便利。

# 3.5 L2发链平台

L2发链平台以Optimism、Polygon、Arbitrum为代表，同时也包含zkSync、Starknet，它们主要是面向有以太坊生态开发需求的用户，发行L2链，真正意义上来说不算是一条完全独立的区块链。因为它的共识机制、VM、处理性能以及gas费都严重依赖以太坊的架构，并且在可扩展性方面也存在许多不足。

# 4. 技术差异对比：灵活性和定制化成为趋势！

通过上面对各个发链平台的分析可以看出，每个平台都有自己的特点，在模块化、定制化、安全性、网络性能等方面均有不同的取舍。例如，以应用为重心的项目可以选择Cosmos构建自己的应用链；如果看重以太坊生态的发展和安全性，那么可以选择OP、Arbitrum或者Polygon构建自己的Layer2链；如果看好Move生态的发展，那么可以选择基于Starcoin构建一条独立的Move公链。

但从发链的目的出发，我们需要思考符合开发者搭建一条公链的需要是什么？是为数百万用户提供高TPS、超低gas、流畅的商用级服务，还是为一个企业提供高定制化、参数灵活、具备权限管理的内部系统。

下面我们将从共识机制、互操作性、网络性能和交易成本、VM等角度对各个发链平台进行综合比较，看下各个发链平台的优劣所在。

# 4.1 共识机制

在共识上，大部分发链平台都采用的是PoS，通过质押原生代币确保网络的安全性和去中心化，当然也有一些小的不同，如Polkadot采用的是NPOS（提名权益证明），Cosmos采用的是PoS+BFT（拜占庭容错）结合得共识机制。当然也有一些项目兼容PoW和PoS，如Starcoin。

PoS不需要实体矿机，不会消耗大量的复杂计算能力和电力，相对来说更环保、节能，因为不需要复杂计算，通常来说交易速度会更快。但在确保去中心化和安全方面，PoS也需要更多的节点参与网络维护，类似以太坊就拥有一个庞大的节点网络。

而PoW作为第一代共识机制，通过计算哈希函数的复杂度来增加攻击难度，攻击者需要消耗巨大的算力和电力来控制网络，因而网络更难以被恶意控制。同时，PoW在去中心化方面表现突出，小规模的项目可以用一台电脑、一台手机，甚至是一个网络宽带就可以参与挖矿，大规模的可以采用专业的矿机。目前，PoW 是最早被广泛采用的共识机制，已在多个区块链上成功运行了多年，在安全性和去中心化方面表现优异。

# 4.2 网络性能

理论上网络性能与交易成本成反比关系，性能越高交易成本越低，而这里所说的性能主要是TPS和BPS。据统计Polkadot每条平行链的TPS仅为1000，虽然比一些老牌的公链更有优势，但作为能承载更多Web3应用的公链来说显然是不够的。

而作为以太坊扩容方案的L2也不尽人意，Optimism和Arbitrum理论最大TPS分别为714 tx/s和40,000 tx/s，而记录的最大TPS表现为67.41 tx/s和944 tx/s。

https://preview.redd.it/8yx4qvculu1e1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e3c531992d0c1e9ac6b99ce2a924d9686c1e10

[https://chainspect.app/compare/arbitrum-vs-optimism](https://chainspect.app/compare/arbitrum-vs-optimism)

同时在Gas费方面，虽然相对以太坊有了极大降低，但Optimism发送ETH的gas为0.09美元，交易的gas为0.18美元；Arbitrum发送ETH的gas为0.09美元，交易的gas为0.27美元。这个价格相对于Solana、BSC等一众L1来说已经相当高了。

https://preview.redd.it/psx4gvrvlu1e1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ddc2f89e35f5c952772d32359038a30528bafb

[https://l2fees.info/](https://l2fees.info/)

Polygon理论的最大TPS为649 tx/s，Avlanche理论最大TPS为357 tx/s，均没有超过1000。但基于Move语言开发的Starcoin近期观察到它升级了主网2.0，TPS最大理论值达到130,000 tx/s，这相当的惊人，与目前统计的发链平台相比，已经是断层式领先，当然由于2.0主网仍在试运行阶段，所以在正式环境下是否真能达到恐怖的13万还有待验证，但打个对折，能超过50,000 TPS也已经是性能公链的龙头了。

同时，在BPS（每秒出块数）上也有不同的差异。我们知道区块生成速度直接的影响交易速度，出块速度越快，意味着同样区块大小的情况下可打包的交易越多，同时交易确认速度也越快。其中，Polygon 2.13s/block，Avalanche 2.05s/block，Polkadot 6s/block，Starcoin 1s/block，可以看出Starcoin在这方面还是明显优于其他公链的，而Polkadot这方面落后较大。

# 4.3 VM虚拟机

我们知道VM是在区块链中是执行智能合约，计算gas消耗的作用，所有的dApp都需要虚拟机才能正常运行。

Polygon、Optimism、Arbitrum、Avalanche采用的是以太坊的虚拟机EVM，采用Solidity开发语言编写，它可以支持字节码兼容的智能合约的能力使其能够跨各种区块链，同时EVM 擅长执行复杂且定制的智能合约，这对于包括 dApp、 DeFi平台、游戏和NFT在内的各种应用程序至关重要。同时，EVM也是目前最大的区块链生态系统，背后有一个巨大的开发者社区提供支持，技术更加成熟，生态应用丰富。

但EVM也存在一些不足。例如，可扩展性较差，EVM 每秒只能处理有限数量的事务；较高的Gas费，由于EVM可扩展性不足gas费在网络拥堵的情况下会快速增加；智能合约的不可逆性，一旦部署，区块链上的智能合约就无法更改。

Starcoin采用的Move虚拟机。它在合约运行前会进行校验，这个验证器可以检查出各种类型错误。在合约调用过程中合约的状态的安全性主要要通过编程语言内部的安全性进行隔离，确保智能合约更安全的运行。

同时与EVM相比，Move语言的可组合性体现在模块上，模块本身被存储在全局存储中，所以在智能合约优化升级方面只需针对其组合的模块进行即可，加速合约的升级优化速度。

# 4.4 基础组件的可组合性

可组合性主要体现在模块化区块链上，即将整个系统分成若干专门的组件，每个组件都有自己明确的功能和职责。这样的设计允许各个组件针对特定任务进行优化，从而确保高效的执行。就像乐高积木一样，每个积木都有其特定的形状和功能，但可以组合在一起建立各种各样的模型。

https://preview.redd.it/rw2vscrzlu1e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bb06001abdf3a7189799fff3bb98bcdd93192ac

目前发链平台都具备模块化区块链的能力，将区块链分成了执行层、数据可用性层、结算层以及共识层，极大的提升了网络的可组合性。

在Rollups方案中，L2链通常只负责执行层，将共识、数据可用性和结算交给以太坊主网。相对来说有如下优势：

1. 提高链的性能，对以太坊来说即是实现以太坊的扩容；
2. 促进生态繁荣，各模块承担不同功能，又保证整体安全性；
3. 提高用户体验，如指降低费用、减少碎片化、降低使用难度等；
4. 降低构建 Rollup L2 链的成本，除了从 L1 共享安全性外，还可共享节点运营商、定序器等多种服务。

目前Optimism和Arbitrum均是采用的Rollup方案，它们通过提供软件开发框架，使得通过其平台发行的L2链可以共享安全性、通信层和开源技术。如OP Stack，Arbirtrum Nitro、Polygon CDK，Rollup 框架是模块化区块链发展的最重要的组件，它让以模块化方式来搭建 L2 的门槛大大降低。

但值得注意的是，L2链在模块化构建中，由于Rollup框架、数据可用性服务、定序器、跨链桥等都是由Raas服务商设计好的，所以在定制区块链的时候灵活性和可扩展性较差。

就如dYdX抛弃StarEx上创建的L2（dYdX v3），选择迁移到Cosmos生态并发布dYdX Chain（dYdX v4）。借助Cosmos SDK发布的这条链是一条独立的L1，它摆脱了L2的限制，以业务逻辑为核心，从底层基础设施重新构建高度定制，实现了「完全去中心化的链下订单簿和匹配引擎」，这让 dYdX 作为一个 DeFi 应用能够为用户提供更快、成本更低的衍生品交易服务。

在 Cosmos 的模块化设计中，它将共识、状态机、虚拟机分开，让链的开发者可以更方便地进行积木式组合。比如，作为开发者，你可以定制自己的共识机制、为状态机增加特定的逻辑与模块、选用不同的虚拟机。这也是dYdX选择Cosmos SDK进行构建的原因之一。

而以高度可定制化和可组合性为主要叙事的Starcoin，在模块化区块链构建方面同样表现突出，其开发框架StarStack提供了高度模块化、易组合、易二次开发的技术组件。借助StarStack，开发者可以搭建一条独立的L1，应用根据业务逻辑，从底层框架进行全新构建，并在共识机制、链组件、通信协议、虚拟机等方面可以灵活配置。

根据介绍，其开发框架StarStack具备：

1. 可扩展性：模块化架构将共识、执行和存储等核心功能分解，允许开发者根据需求独立扩展每个模块
2. 灵活性：StarStack 的模块化设计使其能够更灵活地适应技术的更新和变化。每个模块可以单独进行优化或升级，而不会影响整个网络的稳定性。
3. 提升安全性：通过分离不同的功能，降低了单点故障的风险。每个模块相对独立，意味着即使一个模块受到攻击，其他模块仍然能够正常运行，从而提高整个网络的安全性。
4. 兼容与互操作性：模块化设计使得StarStack开发的链 更容易与其他区块链网络进行互操作。例如，通过分离执行层和共识层，可以支持与其他区块链之间的跨链交互和资产转移，进一步提升其生态系统的互通性。
5. 优化交易速度和费用：模块化设计允许不同的执行层处理复杂度不同的交易，优化了交易的执行效率，进而减少了用户在网络上支付的交易费用。

# 4.5 链上治理

治理模块对一个去中心化项目来说至关重要，目前很多项目都是采用的第三方平台进行项目管理，如Snapshot。当然如Polkadot、Cosmos、Starcoin等也开发了自己的链上治理模块，可供开发者调用。

Polkadot SDK提供了一套基于代币的治理模型。新构建的平行链可以通过原生代币参与项目的决策过程。其中，治理机制被协议化为相互关联的功能组件，如国库、议会、公投等，这些组件可以随着协议的升级进行迭代。参与治理的各个主体通过各自的区块链账号与系统交互，进行质押、委托、提案、投票等治理操作。

其治理框架提供的流程为：

1. 提案：提案是对网络的改进、协议升级、参数调整或其他重要事项的正式提议，任何人都可以进行提案；
2. 投票：平行链原生代币持有者可以通过公投投票表达对提案的支持或反对，投票机制可以采用不同的形式，如简单多数、加权投票或代币质押投票等，这些可以定制；
3. 决策：决策过程会根据一定的规则来确定最终的决策结果。这些规则可以包括投票通过的比例、投票持续时间、最低投票数量等；
4. 执行延迟：所有公投都有执行延迟期，这个模块也可以修改相关参数；
5. 自动执行：一旦达到执行延迟期，相应的操作将在链上执行，包括参数的调整、协议的升级、资金的转移等。

为实现链上治理，Polkadot SDK将智能合约、投票合约、投票权重、治理模块和治理参数结合，实现了一套功能完备且可定制化的链上治理机制。这种机制赋予了代币持有者参与决策的权利，并通过智能合约的自动执行确保了治理的透明度和公正性。

Cosmos SDK在链上治理方面体现出了一些创新，在提案之前应用链会预先打包了一个治理系统，提案可以是基于代码或文本，并且创建提案的权限可以自定义，然后由验证者和委托人进行投票，并提交到区块链上，在那里内容可以被验证者执行。

关于链上治理，Cosmos SDK提供了4个限制性门槛，可有应用链开发者选择和修改相关参数：

1. 质押应用链代币：为了防止垃圾信息，创建提案时需在设置的时间内质押一定数量的原生代币，可以由提案人质押，也可以像社区寻求支持。若规定的时间内未质押足够数量的代币，那么质押的代币将可以选择是否被销毁；
2. 法定人数：进入投票阶段后，有赞成、反对、否决、弃权四个选项，其中否决意思为强烈反对，Cosmos SDK组件中可以定义至少需要满足多少比例的质押代币进行投票才算满足；
3. 否决：在投票期结束前，可以规定不能超过定义比例的否决票；
4. 通过门槛：可以定义赞成的票比例要达到多少才能通过。

可以看出，由Cosmos SDK提供的链上治理相对更政治化，虽然可以由开发者定制相关参数，但门槛较多，并不适用于大多数普通用户。

而Starcoin的StarStack在链上治理方面推陈出新，通过DAO形式的治理机制，促进由StarStack构建的区块链实现去中心化治理，建立更包容、透明和高效的治理模式。相对Polkadot和Cosmos，StarStack的提案流程更精简友好，决策和交易公开透明，所有社区成员都可以参与网络治理。

1. 提案流程：DAO形式的治理流程精简且用户友好。首先由发起人提出变更或新政策。随后，由网络用户参与投票，用他们的代币表达对每项提案的偏好，这里可以由开发者定义提案时间、投票权重、通过形式以及提案的执行方式等，给开发者更多的定制化空间；
2. 与众不同的实现方式：StarStack DAO采用了一种独特的方法，即由不同的合约模块控制不同类型的提案。这种模块化系统是 Move 静态函数调用分布的结果，要求所有代码调用在编译时预先确定；
3. 去中心化投票：StarStack DAO采用基于代币的投票系统，投票数量与持有的代币数量成正比，同时开发者还可以调整投票代币的权重，如1000个代币以下是1 : 1，1000\~5000代币是1 : 0.8，以此来削弱持币大户的影响力，促进项目的去中心化治理；
4. 提案生命周期： StarStack DAO提供了一个全面的提案生命周期，包括待决、激活、失败、同意、排队、可执行和已执行等阶段，这些环节的参数均可以由开发者进行修改或停用。

通过StarStack DAO治理模块可以做到：

* 安全透明：DAO的链上治理确保透明度和安全性，所有决策和交易记录透明且防篡改；
* 高效：直接治理模式简化决策过程，无需中间人，减少官僚延误；
* 社区赋权：每个代币持有者投票，增强社区凝聚力，让每个成员对网络未来发展方向发表意见；
* 去中心化：通过调整代币投票的权重，可以调动更多的普通用户参与项目治理，削减持币大户的影响力，实现项目的去中心化治理；
* 高度可定制化：从提案流程、实现形式、去中心化投票以及提案生命周期等模块进行全面高度的可定制化设计，满足开发者对项目治理各种想法，给开发者提供更多灵活操作的空间。

# 4.6 数据可用性层

数据可用性层（DA层）主要负责确保网络中的数据可被访问和验证，它通常包括数据的存储、传输和验证等功能，以保证区块链网络的透明度和信任。

目前最具有代表性的 DA 项目有 Celestia、Avail、EigenDA 等。Opitimism、Arbitrum等rollup发链平台是没有DA层的，而Polkadot、Cosmos、Starcoin、Avalanche等单体公链本身是作为DA层。

Celestia 采用模块化架构，将区块链分解为数据、共识和执行三个部分。执行层独立存在于各自的区块链上，允许针对特定用例进行优化和专业化。此外，在 Celestia 的模块化区块链中，可以实现数据可用性采样，使节点能够用很小的样本验证一个区块，并且低硬件配置的设备也能充当节点。具体实现：

* 分离共识和执行层：允许开发者只需专注于他们的应用逻辑和智能合约，而无需处理底层的共识机制
* 专用数据可用性层：提供一个专门的数据可用性层，确保所有数据在链上是可用和可验证的
* 轻量级客户端支持：允许轻节点通过数据可用性取样来验证数据的可用性，而无需下载和存储整个区块链的数据
* 共享安全性：新启动的区块链可以共享 Celestia 的安全性，利用其强大的共识和数据可用性服

EigenDA是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化数据可用性服务，利用 EigenLayer 的再质押（Restaking）功能构建，并成为 EigenLayer 上首个主动验证服务（AVS）。主要为Layer2提供数据可用性服务，具体实现如下：

* 利用再质押功能：允许以太坊质押者将其质押的 ETH 委托给 EigenDA，从而为数据可用性服务提供担保。
* 数据发布和存储：Rollup 可以将其交易数据发布到 EigenDA，EigenDA 通过分布式存储和验证机制，确保这些数据是可用和可验证的。
* 节点验证：在 EigenDA 系统中，节点运营商负责执行数据验证任务，确保数据的完整性和可用性
* 增强安全性和吞吐量：随着 EigenDA 上的质押量增加以及参与的节点和协议的发展，系统的整体安全性和交易吞吐量都会进一步提升

Eigen DA 的节点是 EigenLayer 网络中再质押节点的子集，由200名运营商和数百万再质押的ETH作为保护，继承了部分以太坊的安全性。但也正是因为依赖以太坊主网上的 Eigen DA 合约，所以在费用消耗上要高于其他DA层，它目前的写入速度是15 MB/s。

Avail 通过其 “Avail DA、Avail Nexus 和 Avail Fusion” 的三位一体方法简化了 Rollup 体验。每个组件在这个方法中扮演着独特的角色，共同提升了 Rollup 的性能、易用性和互操作性。

* Avail DA：提供了一个专门的数据可用性层，确保所有发布的数据在链上是可用且可验证的，Rollup 依赖这一层来确保状态转移和证明生成所需的数据是可用的。
* Avail Nexus：旨在将数据可用性和执行层分离。通过这种分离，利用 Avail DA 作为信任根，开发者可以独立于数据层来构建 Rollup，专注于应用逻辑和状态转移，而无需担心底层的数据可用性问题。
* Avail Fusion： 提供跨链兼容性，支持与多个区块链平台的互操作。这种跨链能力使得开发者可以在不同区块链之间轻松迁移和部署他们的 Rollup，提升了 Rollup 的可移植性和应用范围。

作为发链平台的Polkadot、Cosmos、Avalanche等本身就承载DA的需求，没有单独分离出DA层，数据的存储、传输、验证都是在其主网上进行，这样就造成了一些问题：

* 性能低下，区块链的性能等效于单个节点的水平；
* 大量的网络活动会引起极高的 Gas Fee；
* 天量的数据会引起状态爆炸，导致节点硬件要求增高，尤其是磁盘空间需要永久记录，这又与去中心化这个大前提相悖；
* 公链的升级改进在这种框架下极为困难。

提别要提到是Starcoin，它将数据可用性层单独分离出来，拥有自己的数据可用性层Starcoin DA，负责其主网和新开发的L1区块链数据的存储、校验和确认。Starcoin DA数据的高效、低成本和安全性验证，主要通过如下方式实现：

* 增强的可扩展性：通过并行化技术和FlexiDAG结构，提供了更高的可扩展性，开发者可以构建高吞吐量的区块链，这些链在Starcoin DA上发布数据，享受其高效的数据可用性和共识服务，从而实现更高的交易吞吐量和更低的交易成本。
* 资源动态调用：StarStack开发框架中提供了支持资源动态调用的功能，这意味着网络的计算资源可以根据网络需求动态调整。随着网络负载的增加，节点的计算资源将可以不断在各个区块链之间切换，有效做到了供给与需求的合理调配，确保了网络的高效运行和资源的合理利用。
* 灵活的开发工具：StarStack提供了一系列开发工具、SDK 和详细的文档，帮助开发者快速上手并创建自己的独立区块链，这些工具和资源简化了开发过程，使启动和部署新链变得更加直观和便捷。

同时，所有数据保存在链上，确保数据的可用性和完整性：

* 节点验证：所有节点都可以访问并验证数据；
* 高安全性：由于所有数据都在区块链上，任何节点都可以验证数据的完整性和有效性
* 透明度高：所有数据公开可见，易于审计；
* 去中心化：所有节点都能访问完整的数据，确保系统的去中心化和安全性。

总结下来，目前使用最广泛的仍然是将以太坊作为DA层，而Celestia 、Eigen DA、Avail DA主要是面向rollup以太坊生态，Starcoin DA则可以支持更多独立公链的数据可用性。

如果开发的区块链是L2，或者是以太坊的侧链，在不考虑成本的情况下，选择以太坊无疑是最好的，因为它为数据结算和共识提供了足够的安全性，在考虑成本的情况下，那么Celestia、EigenDA会是不错的选择，它们都支持Arbitrum Orbit、OP Stack等开发框架。

但如果开发需求是一条独立的公链，并且对数据读写速度、网络费用以及安全性有要求，那么可以选择Starcoin作为数据可用性层。因为它的费用足够低，并且数据读写速度可以突破100 MB/s，这非常适用于如社交平台、媒体平台、DeFi、游戏等需要高频交互的项目。在部署上也是非常简单，只需要调用StarStack内数据可用性相关组件，就可以轻松配置到自己的区块链上，与Starcoin主网共享数据安全性。同时，StarStack还配置了共识层，基于StarStack DA层还可以共享Starcoin的网络安全性和去中心化。

# 5. 一键发链技术价值及意义

# 5.1 帮助项目快速上线

一键发链可以帮助区块链项目快速部署自己的区块链网络，节省时间和开发成本。对于想要迅速上线的初创公司或者需要测试其项目的开发团队，一键发链提供了便捷的解决方案，避免了传统复杂的链上配置和开发工作。

# 5.2 为应用突破瓶颈提供支持

目前大多数Web3应用都是用智能合约编写，受限于原生平台，如共识机制、网络性能、交易成本等，一键发链技术成熟后，很多已经成型的应用将可以搭建自己的应用链，实现技术升级和业务的拓展。

# 5.3 帮助企业Web3转型

很多传统互联网企业想要实现Web3转型，但受限于技术不足，开发一条区块链复杂度、工程量都太大。实现一键发链后，很多互联网企业都可以接入Web，如社交、电商、游戏、娱乐等行业。

# 6. 瓶颈和挑战

这里提到的瓶颈和挑战主要是面向未来Web3大规模应用展开的，因为就目前Web3应用和用户来看，现有的性能已经完全能够满足圈内用户的交互。但试想面对 \[Next Billion User\] 级别的应用，目前的公链仍不能从容应用。

# 6.1 安全性问题

在Web3大规模爆发的时候，一键发链的需求也会呈指数级增长，越来越多的应用链会上线，随之而来的就是安全性问题。处理好安全性问题是技术应用的前提，这里的安全包括共识层面的安全、智能合约安全、用户账户安全等，因为每一步都有可能导致项目直接黄掉，安全是一个重大的课题，需要开发者和用户共同的参与。

# 6.2 性能问题

从前面我们可以看出，除了Starcoin理论值达到10万级以外，其他发链平台的TPS都非常低，这对于如金融交易平台、社交、游戏等板块来说，显然是不够的。并且我们还看到Optimism和Arbitrum的交易费都超过0.1美元，设想如果我给群里人发一个10元的红包，结果发现手续费都要1元，那么这个功能肯定不会上线。

# 6.3 权限问题

未来的一键发链肯定是面向企业级用户的，企业会有各种类型的需求，特别是在权限管理方面。目前大部分的公链都是开源的，链上数据公开透明，任何人都可以查看。而如果是以社交应用链，那么对于用户的隐私保护、VIP会员、用户等级权限等方面的考虑将会更多，现有的区块链在这方面显然是不满足的。

# 6.4 政策合规问题

正如Avalanche提到的，发链方需要位于有政策支持的国家或地区，开发者需要通过KYC/AML，并且还需要持有相关经营许可证书。合规问题一直是行业发展绕不开的话题，包括之前的瑞波被举报像投资者提供未经注册的证券类产品（XRP），从而导致瑞波官司缠身，项目的发展也停滞不前。

如果新发布的这些协议未在相应国家或地区的金融监管机构注册或者未被认可，可能被视为非法提供金融服务。

# 7. 总结：一键发链的未来

通过对几大主流发链平台的综合比较，我们可以看到，一键发链正逐步走向便捷化、模块化、定制化，并且分流成两条主线路，其一是依赖以太坊生态的L2，另一个则是高度定制化和灵活性的独立L1方向。L2已经趋于饱和，横向发展空间有限，而开发独立L1区块链的需求日益旺盛，未来的增长空间较大。对于未来一键发链的方向，大致有如下几个推论：

* 应用市场对区块链的需求增长变大。目前大部分的去中心化应用，都是基于公链开发的智能合约，但由于受限于公链的可扩展性，应用的规模和市场增长遭遇瓶颈，从dYdX和Uniswap发布独立区块链可以就可以看出。所以，未来会有更多的应用迁移至独立的应用链上。
* 独立L1区块链增长空间较大。Rollup虽然作为以太坊的扩容方案，但共识和结算都受限于以太坊，再去开发更多的L2只会像之前的智能合约一样推高成本，造成网络拥堵，所以开发独立的L1才能真正解决网络拥堵问题。
* 更多传统产业将像Web3转型。随着一键发链技术的成熟，发链的资金和技术成本降低，更多的互联网产业将迁移至Web3这条新赛道，借助区块链技术、代币经济学，实现产业升级。如跨境电商，可以搭建自己的区块链进行订单的查询、物流追踪、商家信用评分等。
* 与AI结合实现一键发链的智能化。AI+Web3将拓展出一条全新的赛道，一键发链门槛将进一步降低，实现类似ChatGPT对话形式的发链设置。例如，可以通过对话，提出定制化需求，让AI帮你实现发链合约的部署和链上参数的设置，这样哪怕是非技术人员也可以轻松部署自己的区块链。"

So I got the book from a library and I didn't know that it was a sequel until after I was already part way through it.  This is the third time this has occurred (Impyrium and with THE EMPIRE'S RUIN – Brian Staveley are both faves of mine). But yeah so I think the stuff that caught me off guard like Orso and Savine being siblings is probably obvious (I confess I thought the two made a great couple two shitty people who made each other better).

Either way, the book is great. let me go into what I loveOrso everyone around him Vick for example I loved her dynamic with especially Tallow though that I will come to. I like the backstory and lore. Since it's a sequel, I think a lot is unexplained (I had this with the other two book series that I read in parallel), so it feels like such a large world that I only know a bit of. I never saw Black Calder in his prime or Bayaz, for that matter, so they do really feel like these larger-than-life figures. I love the growing industrialization and the tensions that it causes. 

The cast of characters is stellar though I have my preferences (everyone who likes orso I tend to like more) 

The Abercrombie style of like in a big scene the shifting pov with some ties between them (the attack on the rail thing and the valbeck uprsing). That I adore like I can't put that massive literary panorama into words.  Except its super great.

My dislikes

Note most of these are like me kind of being a bit salty the characters i liked lost out even if it made sense. 

I kind of dislike the tallow twist. This is me being sad because I liked the tough cop with a heart of gold thing (and I love Vick) but also it just feels idk I dislike it. It’s a good twist and I'm certain if i go back and reread it will become clear. I just feel sad I love their dynamic. Same with the Savine and Orso twist  (or maybe it's not a twist but since I never read the main series it does feel like one for me) but I liked how Orso came out of the doldrums to save her and he became better.  Like just two people who brought out the best in each other. Though even without her he is the GOAT of the series. 

Also, the last part of the book dragged. Once Orso got stabbed in the back I put away the book for like two weeks but the round of twists and counter-twists just kind of made me bored. Once it reaches the final wrapping-up point (Leo and Savine accord and on) it gets much better.  Hildi is going to come back. She is going to come back like the love child of Savine, selest, and a bank all focused on nuking the regime. 

  


My thoughts on a few things

 I love Orso I love him. Hildi and Tunny are great really his entire mini-cast is great. 

North was boring after Rikke and Leo separated and Rikke got her eye out.  So never was a fan of Clover.

Is Leo like deep in the closet? or is it just me?   He goes on and on about Jarund's features idk.  

 With Leo early on I felt myself cringe I wished he was smarter. Once he was done with Orso I wished he was stupider.  I loved how he put himself together and how he overcame his limitations he became smarter then he used his inspirational story of getting his life on track to create a quasi-fascistic military regime kept in check by his wife. Like I don't know how to feel. He’s a bigoted young idiot at first. As he grows and matures he becomes i don't know how to say it. He becomes monstrous.  Checked Reddit looks like everyone hates him. At this rate, I wonder if  there is anyone who is his fan.

Now I never read the first books so my perspective is kind of that of Savine and the other characters. My takes probably sound stupid without the context of the first books but I might as well (and when I read the first books I want to see if I still feel the same)



Sand Dan Glotka feels like a moron a lunatic or deeply unhinged. 



I am rechecking the books and Bayaz feels like a puppet master and all but kind of weak. Like i know he’s not willing to go all out but they can teleport right? What stops them from doing some targeted killings? 

What I am getting to is. Sand Dan Glotka plan is to make the union free. His plan is to burn down the entire system so that Bayaz cannot grow his seeds of power. From my perspective this is basically armchair revolutionary thinking after the revolution everything will be better. Because let me give what I see (savine says this as well) about who benefits 

1. The people? Oh, the corrupt system and the lack of funds to do much came from bayaz but the industrial style suffering. Look no further than Sand’s own daughter. With or without bayaz the awful system would exist and grow. The people didn't benefit from the firestorm that was unleashed. The people might benefit in a hundred two hundred years' time but we don't know. Maybe the union teeters ever more  I can't say the people benefitted from the bread riots the suffering the lunacy the instablity. 
2. The union itself? The union at the start was fighting to hold onto Westport having to hold onto Starikland etc etc. how does the union benefit when the entire political and economic heart explodes? How do you keep Westport from leaving again with Middenland on fire without the shit ton of Valint and Balk cash?   Yeah, the union recovers somewhat but like it's led by a two-headed hydra of a revanchist bitter broken general and an industrialist who is half Mother Teresa and half John Rockefeller.    
3. The public finances? Yeah sure the debt is not payable to Bayaz but like the tax base? The ruined industry?  The thousands of other things wrecked? I don't think the loss of Valint and Brink interest is gonna cover the shit ton of the tax base that is dead maimed or gone.   

All three things are in a worse place than at the start. 

I feel that when Savine rips into him. I concur 100% he played god he doesn't give a shit about anything but his own power. He talks a big game about freedom about the banks corrupting everything and doing good. He unleashed a firestorm and passed power into the hands of lunatics to go against a man who is immortal. Yeah sure he is in charge now but then what? Bayaz has time (even if what Rikke says is true there will be a time before and after him so long that his mastery is but a speck)  yeah he wanted his daughter to rule but he did a great job with that she nearly only died like three times getting saved by chance dumb luck and Orso (you go king) .  in general, his plan was akin to a mosquito trying to harm a human by setting fire to the kitchen and getting three killer bees to stop the hand from swatting it. Nothing means that the human will not come back with some RAID.  



 I know that I might be missing context but I just wanted to get it off my chest how much from what I see Sand is just awful. The only benefit is that instead of all the suffering being guided by some inscrutable demi-god he just wants the boot to be the fellow man. Which is fair but I think he’s a prick (He also helped cause Orso to lose and I mourn my king) 

Sorry for rambling and I know what I say is probably a bit stupid since well i read the sequels before the main series.  I love the books  and Im trying to get the first series.

My concluding statement. 

Love you bayaz love you Hildi give em hell.

  


Oh reread the book 

 Sand/pike hanged all the burners who Orso offered terms to. Hate them so so much.

###COLLEGE FLIGHT TRAINING

You can find and up to date version of this comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/u/RaiseTheDed/s/GhyOY6ponX).

Everyone on this subreddit will say ""don't go to college for flight training, it's useless and more expensive."" Now, with everything, that's a broad answer to a nuanced question.

**Timelime**

College training does take longer. It's a 4 year degree, so expect to stay 4 years. It's definitely no accelerated program. I see many people saying get everything done ASAP, but you're going to pretty much need a 4 year degree eventually. There's a few options on navigating college:

1. Attend a 4 year college aviation program. You get a degree and flight training done. This is the appeal of these programs. You'll be paying for flight training on top of tuition.

2. Attend college for some other degree and do flight training on the side. Now this is generally the recommended method I see on r/flying, but it's not really expanded beyond this. A lot of factors can prevent this route, the biggest being finances. You're going to have to pay for college and training separately. 

3. Skip college and attend an accelerated program. Now this method is most frowned upon here, especially if you attend ATP. The appeal to people for this is to get training done faster, but you don't have a degree that you will eventually need, and accelerated programs are often extremely expensive, and they want you to pay upfront. See my post on [ATP Flight School](https://www.reddit.com/u/RaiseTheDed/s/TbaceChCLD). Also see my post on [Unsecured Loans for Flight Training](https://www.reddit.com/u/RaiseTheDed/s/QzrdRLj7SD)

4. Get a degree, work in said field, earn money, pay for flight training. This will take the longest, but may be the most cost effective.

5. Community college. There are several CCs that have aviation programs. This may be significantly cheaper than a 4-year college. You can always transfer to a 4 year school to get your bachelors, or even an online degree to tick that box. 

Now, one of the caveats of Point 2: lots of people say an aviation degree is worthless and get a degree in something else. On the flip side, if you get a degree in something other than aviation as a ""backup"", don't use it and just fly, get furloughed in 10 years, that backup degree may be just as useless as that aviation degree. Lots of degrees if you don't use, employers will be wary of hiring you. Another point: if you're getting furloughed, the economy is most likely in a recession, and other employers will likely not be hiring either (sometimes not though, look at Spirit in 2024, economy great, company struggling). Now I can't tell you what degrees are better as backups than others, but all I can tell you if you choose this route, get a degree in something you enjoy. 

**Cost of College Aviation Programs**

The biggest gripe I see about college aviation programs is the price. You will be paying for flight training *on top of* tuition, room and board, meal plan, books, etc. College is already expensive, add flight training in the mix, it gets even more expensive. 

Now, as I will discuss in the next section, what a lot of people forget, if you attend a college aviation program, FAFSA aid *may* increase due to the cost of flight training. I say ""may"" because this may be just the college I attended. But, my college financial aid office calculated how much you are expecting to spend, which when they put into the computer, spit out a higher financial aid that I would receive. It wasn't much, but it was a factor. If you don't attend an college aviation program, *FAFSA cannot be used*.

**Ways to Make Things Cheaper**

I'm going to make a list of various ways to make college cheaper. 

- Like discussed last paragraph, FAFSA (studentaid.gov) can help if you attend a college aviation program. If you attend college, you *should* fill out FAFSA. They offer grants, government loans, etc. On a note for government loans: these loans are backed by the US government. What does that mean? Rates are much, much lower than a private student loan. My loans are around 4.5-5.5%. compare that to a private loan of 10-15%. Government loans have two types: subsidized and unsubsidized. Subsidized means you don't have to pay until you graduate. Unsubsidized means you have to pay something immediately (might just be interest while attending college, I honestly can't remember). Another thing to note, government loans can be forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, but you have to work for the government for that to happen (if your goal is to work for the FAA, there you go).

- Another possible method is community college. Sometimes CC gets a bad rep, but in my state, all classes at the CCs and state schools are the same (the Math 100 class is the same at both CC and State 4 year school). What does this mean? You can take classes at the CC for significantly cheaper price. A normal 5-credit class (quarter system) in my state costs around $700-$800. Now how does that apply to you? Good question! You can take all your Gen Ed classes at the CC and transfer to a 4 year college with all the Gen Eds complete. Which means you just need to complete the aviation classes. 

- Another method similar to the last point, you can complete your flight training at a community college. There are many around that have aviation programs. You complete your flight training at the CC, get your associates, transfer to a 4 year college and get a 4 year degree. Apparently people do this at my local schools: Clover Park Technical College, then transfer to Green River College to finish a 4 year degree. You could also just get your associates and then try to get hired at a regional without the 4 year degree, and do the 4 year degree online when flying for said regional. 

- Now, if you're a parent reading this, or you are still in high school, the last point is also ties into this: duel enrollment. My state has a program that allows junior and senior high school students to attend classes at your local community college, either in addition to high school classes, or instead of high school classes. This program is either very cheap, if not free (I honestly can't remember, and probably depends on your state). This means you can complete all your Gen Eds before even graduating high school for a cheaper price.

- Scholarships. There's lots of scholarships out there, not just for aviation. There's many, many general scholarships that don't apply to certain programs and degrees. From what I've heard, tons of these scholarships barely have any applicants. Apply to as many as you can. Lots of small organizations have scholarships as well, such as local EAA chapters, not just the main EAA. Many colleges have merit scholarships as well that they give to students. These come from the endowment of the college, and are usually based off of your high school GPA and test scores, if I remember correctly. Smaller private schools are more likely to have them than enormous state schools.

- GI Bill. If you or a parent has the GI Bill, and they are willing to use it on you, that's a fantastic way to get college aviation paid for.

- Now, this one will be less likely, but I'm still throwing it out there: tuition remission. If your parents work at a college or university, they may have tuition remission benefits for you. If you don't want to attend the school your parents work at, you can possibly transfer those benefits to another school using the National Tuition Exchange program. Tuition remission almost makes up for the shitty wages they tend to pay. 

- While attending college, there are work study jobs that give you free room and board, the most notable and common is being an RA. That can shave off a few thousand a year, and some colleges give meal plans to RAs as well.

If I'm forgetting any, let me know and I'll add it.

**Experiences**

If anyone wants their experience added here, I'd be happy to add it. 

I can't talk about college experiences without mentioning subreddit member dash_trash's comment on Embry-Riddle. You can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/s/n5SodMErpE). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/s/I1CSHViCmK) is an updated reflection on that post (2024).

CVS Q3 2024 earnings analysis - Earnings call/10Q release 11/06/24,Healthcare_Anon,1gn2x7a,2024-11-09 00:19:19,25,0.94,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1gn2x7a/cvs_q3_2024_earnings_analysis_earnings_call10q/,Moocao123,Due Diligence,"Greetings Healthcare company investors,

As we are now Friday after market close, and even after-hours markets are closed, I thought now would be the best time to review the CVS earnings call on 11/06/24 and take a look ***specifically at the MA insurance segment section of the report itself***. I believe I have spoken against trying to short excessively after the market has turned against a company to almost a 5 year low - ***and again I was proven correct on CVS as well***. As usual, our disclaimers:

Before I begin, I would like to thank Karen Lynch for her years of leadership, dedication, and strategic vision. Karen is a friend to me and many others across the CVS Health organization, and we wish her all the best. 

*I can feel the sincerity dripping.*

It will also require the right leadership team. Today, we announced two leadership appointments that will help us drive better performance across the enterprise and at Aetna specifically. First, Prem Shah, who has been running our pharmacy and consumer wellness business, is elevated to Group President and will now also be responsible for the health services segment. Second, we appointed Steve Nelson as President of Aetna.

*More Leadership changes?*

Results in our healthcare benefits business remain challenged as a result of continued elevated levels of utilization. While we are clearly underperforming at HCB today, this business has incredible earnings potential and is an essential element to our strategy. We expect the elevated levels of utilization will continue to pressure our 2024 performance and as a result, we are not providing a formal outlook today, although Tom will provide some comments on what we may expect directionally. I appreciate and understand your desire for us to provide guidance at this stage.

*How does CVS stock price rise when the guidance itself says...* ***nothing?***

The entire industry has seen pressure, including elevated utilization coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher acuity as a result of the Medicaid redeterminations; however, I recognize that we have been more acutely impacted than others in the industry. As a result of our disappointing star ratings for 2024, we began the year with a known and temporary reimbursement challenge. When we priced our Medicare Advantage business for 2024, we clearly underestimated the medical cost. In this rising trend environment, we offered rich benefits which exacerbated our utilization pressures and grew membership rapidly.

*So... is this a mispricing issue or is this a population health management issue? Aetna says it is a mispricing issue.*

Our individual exchange business, another area where we had a large increase in membership, has seen pockets of higher utilization and several disappointing risk adjustment updates. These miscalculations during the 2023 bid processes have significantly burdened Aetna's current results.

*Again mispricing? Are the Actuaries getting the axe? Why are only pharmacists taking it in the chin?* ***Time to UNIONIZE.***

Our risk management processes have been restructured to pull underwriting and pricing authority out of the business units and into the financial chain. This realignment will help improve transparency and accountability as we execute our margin recovery and drive profitable growth.

*Wow... Dang that was harsh. Now Aetna's Actuaries are under management's direct gaze. This won't be fun.*

Our teams have been addressing the challenge of strained clinical operations by improving staffing and training. We are utilizing technology to automate and streamline processes; for example, through the power of AI, we have simplified clinical case preparation and meaningfully reduced the amount of time our care managers spend on case prep.

*Again using AI for direct patient care. Sometimes the case managers actually need to read through the whole history to understand a patient, does AI capture any nuances during the ""translation""?*

By the end of November, we will have completed our previously announced three-year store optimization initiative targeting 900 stores and expect to close approximately 270 stores in 2025. 

***Pharmacists need to Unionize. This is getting out of hand. 1170 store closure in 2 years, we are going to see rural impacts by 2026 and everyone will wonder what happened.***

Through thoughtful benefit design, we continue to introduce Aetna members to high-quality providers like Oak Street Health, allowing us to improve member experiences and deliver better health outcomes.

*Vertical integration continues unabated at CVS, but the big hiccup is Aetna delivering value. As you can see, the vertical integration chain shakes a lot if the insurance segment gets into problems.*

I'll start with a few highlights on total company performance. Third-quarter revenues were approximately $95.4 billion, an increase of approximately 6% over the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our healthcare benefits and pharmacy and consumer wellness segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $2.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.09. Year-to-date cash flow from operations were approximately $7.2 billion, a lower result as compared to the same period last year primarily due to the timing of CMS receipts and the impact of higher utilization on HCB earnings. 

*Finally the numbers, it took awhile to get here.*

During the quarter, the segment generated an adjusted operating loss of $924 million. This result includes the impact of premium deficiency reserves of approximately $1.1 billion recorded primarily in our Medicare and individual exchange businesses. As a reminder, PDRs generally measure variable losses in a product and do not contemplate fixed expenses. The aggregate of the PDRs was comprised of approximately $670 million of healthcare costs and $394 million of operating expenses specifically related to the write-off of unamortized deferred acquisition costs.

*So 1.1B for premium deficiency reserve (the uh oh piggybank in case Q4 is disastrous). That is a lot of money...*

Our medical benefit ratio of 95.2% increased 950 basis points from the prior-year quarter, including the 220 basis point impact from the PDRs. This increase was primarily driven by higher utilization, higher acuity in Medicaid, the premium impact of lower star ratings for payment year 2024, and an update to our 2024 individual exchange risk adjustment accrual. Medical costs remain elevated in our Medicare book and at levels above what was contemplated in our previous guidance.

*Whew, but I need to check my Excel on the real MBR here.*

The pressure was largely attributable to the same categories we discussed last quarter, including in-patient, outpatient, supplemental benefits, and pharmacy. During the third quarter, we also saw unfavorable development of 2024 medical costs primarily related to second-quarter dates of service, which has adversely impacted our trend outlook for the remainder of the year. Medical costs in our individual exchange business also accelerated during the quarter with broad levels of higher utilization above our prior expectations. The pressure we've experienced thus far has been primarily driven by certain high-cost geographies where the combination of our growth in middle-tier mix has led to higher medical costs.

*Ok they didn't digest their MA patients well at all*

One other item I would like to highlight for investors is that we took a restructuring charge of nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter. This amount reflects several components, including impairment charges for approximately 270 stores we expect to close in 2025, costs related to the discontinuation of non-core businesses, and costs associated with workforce optimization. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet, for our third quarter we generated year-to-date cash flow from operations of approximately $7.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $837 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries.

*CVS basically called 2024 the restructuring year, fired the CEO, the Aetna President, restructured the C suites, and prayed 2025 will be better.*

Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 4.6 times, which is above our long-term target. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings and expect our leverage to return to more normalized levels as we execute on margin recovery in the Aetna business. 

*I didn't expect to hear anything about leverage ratio.*

Similar to others within the industry, Medicare Advantage utilization continues to be elevated. We have also grown membership very rapidly with a very rich benefit offering, which has resulted in benefit-induced utilization. Medicaid continues to be pressured by the dislocation between acuity and rates, as well as seeing some pockets of higher utilization. We have also seen rapid growth in our individual exchange business, which has led to several disappointing updates on risk-adjusted revenue and, in some states, higher-than-expected utilization.

*Uh oh...*

We expect 2025 to be a transition year that positions us for outperformance of our long-term growth target in future years. We also remain cautious in our outlook for front-store sales, which have been pressured in recent quarters, consistent with the broader macroeconomic backdrop. As we previously discussed, we expect a return of certain variable corporate expenses. We also expect higher interest as we annualize the expense from our May 2024 financing, a decline in net investment income, and modest dilution from the increase in our share count.

*Pray for 2025!*

We believe our deliberate approach to our 2025 Medicare Advantage bids and our focused changes to our footprint, which we expect to result in membership disenrollment of 5% to 10%, when combined with our improved star ratings will result in margin recovery. This is a significant first step on our journey back to target margins of 3% to 5%. 

*Ok, so we know Aetna is ALSO trying to lose members by 5-10% (possibly market exits)?*

We are also projecting modest negative margins in our Medicaid business. It is possible that our healthcare benefits business could show operating losses in 2024 after generating over $5.5 billion of adjusted operating income in 2023. Conversely, this means that there are well over $3 of embedded adjusted EPS if we could return Aetna's profitability to 2023 levels. Open enrollment for both Medicare Advantage and individual exchange has demonstrated that we took meaningful action in curtailing benefits, adjusting products, and where appropriate raising prices.

*Get ready for higher inflation for health insurance!*

**Q&A: MA focused only**

**Lisa Gill (JPM):**

One, when I think about the MA bids that you put in for 2025, you talked about, and we all saw in the plan finder the cuts, can you maybe just talk about -- I know we're only one month in, but are you seeing the disenrollment that you expected, and two, just given the size of the surprise that we've seen here in the back half of the year, the level of confidence that you have around the bids that you did put in for 2025, if I could understand that.

Then just secondly, you talked about pharmacy, we've heard others talk about pharmacy trends here in the back half of the year really shifting and changing because of the Inflation Reduction Act and changes around kind of catastrophic coverage. Just curious, one, did you see that as well specific to those changes, and is it benefiting perhaps some of the other sides of your business?

**Response:**

We're early in the open enrollment season, but I did reiterate the guidance that we've been giving for a couple of months now. Our early indicators would suggest that we would be down in that size of 10% range on the total book...

As you think about ability and confidence in the bids, the bids are clearly designed to improve results next year, and maybe there's a couple of things I can talk you through at a high level, just to give you a framework to think about that. The first is improvement in stars, and so because of the contracts that we have that are now going to be four stars or better for 2025 payment year, that's going to be about an $800 million \[tailwind\]..

Finally, we've both exited underperforming counties and we've pulled underperforming products that will impact nearly half a million members. Those changes should also improve profitability in '25 as many of those members will chose newly designed products that will have an improved margin profile.

*Get ready for higher cost plans for non 4 STAR plans. The pain! I know, Trump is going to solve this with more MA money! Who says Republicans are fiscal conservatives?*

**Justin Lake (Wolfe Research)**

First, just wanted to clarify the 4Q commentary -- Tom, you said it's potentially up 700 basis points, or I'm getting to about 95.5% MLR. Does that include the 3Q PDR and the potential Medicare Advantage PDR you mentioned? Then more importantly, how should we think about framing 2024 run rate earnings into 2025? I'm trying to understand -- you know, your MLR looks like it's obviously a lot higher in the third quarter and going to be a lot higher in the fourth quarter. Do we need to run rate that back into the first half, so let's just say $0.75 of earnings decline? Just trying to understand the run rate versus -- you know, you're going to report a number for 2024, but what's the real run rate that we jump off of into 2025?

**Response:**

But on your MLR-specific comments, that is inclusive of the release of the PDR, that you can see that 700 basis point increase, but not necessarily inclusive of a PDR in group, which will depend on a variety of factors. *\[Commentary mine - you don't want to read into these factors, I can write it out but you won't understand because what was said is higher level projection based on projection maths, which is OK, but CVS has failed their projection maths 3 quarters in a row already so... yea, no\]*

*Holy crap that is one massive MLR projection from Wolfe Research and CVS didn't even bother rebutting. Whooof!*

**Stephan Baxter (Wells Fargo):**

You did mention in response to that question, it's important to differentiate the incremental trend that's coming out of benefits that have already been restructured for 2025 versus more potentially core areas of utilization, so maybe can you help us understand better what you saw in the third quarter? Then just on the PDR commentary for 2025, you're citing you potentially need one for group MA but you're not saying you need one for individual MA, or potentially the exchanges. Just wondering why or why not that would be the case.

**Response:**

The way the PDRs are calculated is partially based on how those products are sold, and so our individual Medicare products are differently grouped than how our group Medicare products are. As you can imagine, the nature of the contracts in the group business tends to be multi-year and so there's less ability to make improvement year over year, and so that business has a different profile going into '25 than the individual business in Medicare does or the individual exchange business does...

As David noted, we unfortunately grew that business too fast. We're suffering significant losses in '24, mostly led by our SEP members. This pressure was compounded by unfavorable middle product mix, which skewed to certain geographies. We have taken, as I believe we've previously discussed, double-digit rate increases across this book for next year, and as a deliberate consequence of that rate action, we expect we could shrink that book by as much as 20 to 25% next year, so those actions combined with some of the operational improvements that the teams are making on the ground should also help to improve performance next year...

As it relates to trend, we have continued to see supplemental benefit trends be elevated throughout all of 2024, and that persisted into the third quarter. Where we've also seen trend pressure, as I noted in the prepared remarks, has been in all the usual suspects this year -- it's been in in-patient, it's been in outpatient, although the types of procedures that we've seen have shifted somewhat. We continue to see pressure on things like medical pharmacy, particularly on some of the oncology drugs, and so it's a lot of the same things that we have been talking about throughout the whole year.

*Meaning PDR might be a single year problem, hopefully, according to CVS, as they are going to shrink that area of non profitability. Their supplemental benefits are being utilized generously - because people get cancer, they get outpatient services, they get hospitalized,* ***they probably didn't get the best population care***.

**Joshua Raskin (Nephron Research):**

I want to make sure I understood what you said, that no PDR has been contemplated for 2025, so MA and \[Inaudible\] lost money in totality in '24 and it will be positive in 2025? I just want to make sure we've got that right. Then more importantly, can you speak to your updated Medicare, both MA and PDP distribution strategy, and I'm specifically interested in your commission strategy with external brokers and feedback you guys are getting on that.

**Response:**

On the PDR, the PDR is a pretty esoteric accounting rule, and so it looks at the business and looks at it on a variable cost basis, and as we look at and think about our projections for next year, with the improvements that we are expecting across those books, the only one that we think might be close to the line is the group Medicare business, which is why we highlighted that for investors; but I wouldn't take that to mean that we are necessarily going to be profitable, because you have to allocate out those fixed costs, which are fairly substantial as you think about the fixed costs associated with those two large businesses. As you think about our strategy for both MA and PDP, we are going to shrink membership in PDP. We do use a lot of broker channels.

*OK, so NOT just a one year PDR thing... I am getting confused.*

**Elizabeth Anderson (Evercore):**

Maybe just one question about the PDR opex mechanics that you guys talked about on the third quarter -- for the third-quarter PDR. Does that from an opex perspective, does that flip and become a positive to your numbers in the fourth quarter? That would by my first question.

Then secondarily, can you just maybe dig in a little bit more on the PCW strength? How do we expect that cadence to change as we think about the pull forward from COVID, and then any kind of seasonality you guys are thinking about for the fourth quarter?

**Response:**

On the PDR mechanic, the way that this works is that you look at what the potential losses might be on a variable basis, you record the PDR, and really how you record it is that one of the first places you have to look is you have to look at any deferred acquisition costs that you have hung up on the balance sheet. You accrue for that, you take those down first -- that means that while you're not really reversing a reserve, you don't have expense that you otherwise would have anticipated having in the fourth quarter, so it is an expense benefit and an MLR benefit, so the vast majority of that $1.1 billion will come back in the fourth quarter.

On the PCW strength, I'd say a few things. First and foremost, we had a really strong quarter. Part of that was driven by immunization season coming sooner than we expected -- it started in mid-August versus later that month or early September, and we had a first market mover there, we were ready for that, our teams were prepared. We've been preparing for that season for the most part of the year.

The second piece, I would say is around our core service levels continue to remain very strong. We've continued to improve our NPS levels, up hundreds of basis points year over year, and that's turning into what I would say is strong script growth as it relates to our pharmacy business now, around 27.3%, up 70-plus basis points year over year, so another great example of the strong service driving script growth in our pharmacy segment of that business

*I think I know what the PDR mechanic is, but it needs a graph and a lot of details to hash this out. Basically it is a mathematics equivalent of ""trust me bro"" but with ""higher level accountant math"".*

**Andrew Mok (Barclays):**

Wanted to follow up on Medicare Advantage margins. With the lower margin level that you're seeing today, was hoping you could give us an update on how you're thinking around the pace of MA margin improvement over the next few years.

In your prepared remarks, you noted the journey back to target MA margins of 3% to 5% -- that's a slight change from your previous target of 4% to 5%, so just curious what drove that change and why 3% to 5% is the appropriate margin level.

**Response:**

Let me answer the second part first because the answer to that question is really primarily mathematical. As you think about the IRA changes to the Part D program, significant dollars that were previously recorded as reinsurance are now going to get recorded as premium, which increases the denominator of the calculation, so at constant dollars of margin, that change alone is significant to drive a 4% margin down into the 3s. As you think about the longer term, it's a challenging question to answer. We understand and we made deliberate changes to benefits to be able to drive improvement in margin next year.

We anticipate that we'll be able to continue to do that into 2026, and our star scores will help there, right? We had great stars performance. Two-thirds of our members will be in 4.5 star plans that will provide a little bit of additional tailwind as well, but we really need to understand what the rate environment looks like to be able to answer that question, but our goal would be to increase margins again in 2026 in that business.

*Andrew doesn't like the Root Beer Koolaid*

**Earnings results:**

https://preview.redd.it/1d1263hac30e1.png?width=2018&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7fe715fdbf46e735be6edd835075c68d61c749

As you can see, margin per member has decreased ***extremely significantly***. This is to the point where we may see EPS being ***half*** of 2023, possibly even lower. ***It will all depend on how bad Q4 is, but Q3 results are atrocious.*** The stock price didn't reflect the atrociousness of this earnings. Currently by 24Q3 total EPS is 2.35. Assuming even +1.00 EPS ***(unlikely, highly doubt this would ever occur, I am giving CVS a lot of rope here)*** we are looking at an EPS value of 50% of 2023.

Overall margin per member is currently projected to be reduced ***by a significant margin, possibly up to 50% if not more.***

1. Margin BPS worsened by ***more than 50%***
2. MBR of 95.2% (CVS calculation) 24Q3 vs MBR of 85.7% 23Q3 is a **950 BPS worsening YoY**, and CVS fired their ***CEO this time.*** This is a major issue for CVS that may take years to recover. ***This is what people shorted Clover for in 2021 to 2022.***
3. ***CVS can't even produce guidance for FY2024***, which is why CVS’s market capitalization is reduced to \~ $70 billion dollars compared to \~ 140 billion dollars by 21Q4 reporting date (approximately February 2022). This is a 50% drop within a 3 year period, which is disastrous for a company such as CVS - and this trend maintained for 24Q3

***Skipped Health Services and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments***

**In conclusion:**

Overall the things we learn from CVS ER is similar to HUM:

1. CVS is actively discussing plan restructuring to maintain margins. Other plans now include [splitting the company](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/cvs-is-considering-a-break-up-heres-why-that-could-be-risky.html) ([as evidenced by numerous reports](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cvs-explores-options-including-potential-break-up-sources-say-2024-09-30/))
2. MBR rose YoY 95.2% (CVS calculation) 24Q3 vs MBR of 85.7% 23Q3 - a 950 BPS worsening. ***This is a material concern, one causing turmoil and upheaval at CVS C suites.***
3. Impact of CMS V28 – **we believe this is occurring at CVS.**
4. Cost rise is probably related to CVS increasing membership in 2024, which they basically admitted in Q3.

I hope you enjoyed reading this earnings report. Since 10Q is released, I do not feel like any additional information can be gleaned,

Although I did not focus on the exact earnings numbers itself, I hope I illustrated some trends within the MA space. My goal is only to focus on MA space.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this long post, and I hope you educated healthcare sector investors have learned something from my musings.

Sincerely

**On Insurance Growth**

***Andrew Toy***

We’ve driven strong clinical and financial performance in our insurance business, highlighted by meaningful adjusted EBITDA profitability and strong insurance loss ratios. I’m very proud that we’ve significantly increased adjusted EBITDA profitability to over $62 million year-to-date on a membership base of 81,000 lives.

These strong financial results position us well to invest in membership growth going into 2025. This AEP, we believe we are offering a highly appealing and competitive product for Medicare eligibles and we are prioritizing both acquiring new members and maintaining strong retention rates. With this strategy, we believe there is ample opportunity to expand our market share throughout 2025 in our core markets.

We’re particularly excited about the timing of our growth opportunity. Other plans have struggled to maintain Star Ratings and manage the cost of care, and are effectively being forced to make strategic retreats by making plan closures, dropping providers from their networks and pulling back on benefits. By maintaining our own benefit and network strength and leveraging our improved Star Ratings, we are set up to be in a very good position.

While it’s too early to discuss our 2025 posture in detail, our intent is to take advantage of the opportunity in front of us by focusing on growth while maintaining consolidated profitability via strong management of our returning member cohorts. We’re demonstrating a clear ability to grow into the strength of our model with our profitable existing member cohorts fueling growth and having a clear focus on bringing new members onto our care platform.

We’ll obviously have more to talk about regarding our annual enrollment period performance in the future, but overall we feel very good about how we positioned our business for growth in 2025 on the back of our strong performance in 2024.

To be clear though, we believe this growth opportunity will not be a one-year window. As I mentioned, we are very proud to have recently received a 4-Star Rating for our flagship PPO plans. By achieving this rating, we’ll have tailwinds going into payment year 2026 that will allow us to continue to invest in our flywheel as we expand profitability while continuing to accelerate growth. And again, our Stars improvement came at the same time as the broader industry saw Star Rating degradation, setting us up to continue to differentiate our products for our members.

***Peter Kuipers***

Given a strong profitability profile, we have decided to strategically evaluate areas of opportunity to reinvest into our business. As Andrew mentioned earlier, we believe that we are strongly positioned to invest in our membership growth opportunities for 2025 and beyond as a result of the 2024 performance, improved Star Ratings and our ability to outperform during a period of market volatility.

For these reasons, we plan to make prudent investments that position as well to increase long-term growth. These investments include additional growth-focused spend to support the annual enrollment period or AEP, as well as quality-focused spend focused on further improving outcomes for our members, including continued R&D to further enhance Clover Assistant capabilities. We believe that now is the optimal time to do this in light of our strong performance.



**On Counterpart Assistant** 

***Peter Kuipers***

Beyond the business momentum, in our own Medicare finance insurance business, we have good momentum in a strong pipeline for Counterpart Health, which provides a SaaS and tech-enabled services solution for third-party payers and risk-bearing providers.

Demonstrating this during the third quarter, we announced a multiyear partnership with the Iowa Clinic to utilize Counterpart Assistance for MA and MSP patients, marking our inaugural extension into the Midwest. While this is exciting, we’re still in the early innings and expect Counterpart revenue impact this year to be insignificant. We look forward to sharing more detailed financial guidance and expectations in the future as we further develop and grow our Counterpart SaaS and tech-enabled services offering.

We continue to be very excited about the progress and long-term opportunity to bring our technology to other value-based providers and MA plans via our Counterpart Health SaaS and tech-enabled services offering.

As a reminder of our core strategy, we plan to grow our own MA plan significantly and profitably within our current markets, and we plan to also expand to new geographies. For markets where we don’t have an MA plan, Counterpart Health allows us to bring in our model of Medicare Advantage Managed Care via partnerships with local providers and plans.

Since we launched the offering earlier this year, we have had significant interest in the platform, and this interest has accelerated since we announced our Stars results, particularly the fact that our PPO plan received the highest HEDIS score for core HEDIS measures for plans over 2,000 members.

Not only do we offer strong performance, but what others find particularly compelling is that we specialize in improving the performance of wide-network, fee-for-service, independent physicians. Most managed care entities have no real solution for this component of the care ecosystem, and so the fact that we are able to drive excellent results in this area gives us unparalleled product market fit.

While this is exciting, we’re still in the early innings. We believe that demand for Counterpart Assistance will only increase as more and more industry players face the market pressures that many insurers and healthcare providers have signaled this year. As we engage with prospective partners, we do expect the larger health organizations to have longer sales cycles and the smaller groups to have shorter sales cycles.

That said, we’re looking to onboard more partners in both 2025 and 2026 when the industry Stars headwinds will come to fruition. Stay tuned for more updates about Counterpart, including us signing up additional partners in the future. Clover is truly at an exciting inflection point, making it a great time to be along for the ride.

Medicare open enrollment: How to add or adjust your coverage,CLOV,1giy2vk,2024-11-03 16:42:27,58,0.98,2,https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/medicare-open-enrollment-163338331.html,Smalldickdave69,Discussion,"From Yahoo finance.  As a confused Canadian, this seems to be a decent article for those of us who aren’t familiar with the USA’s healthcare system for old people to give a quick read.  I feel like I learned a little although I learn most of my knowledge based on MA and Clover from you folks.  

“Traditional Medicare, also sometimes called original Medicare, covers doctor’s office visits and hospital stays, known as Part A and Part B, respectively. Most doctors — including surgeons and specialists — in the U.S. accept Medicare patients. Unlike Medicaid, there is no income limit for eligibility to receive Medicare benefits. Still, Medicare is not free. You’ll pay fees similar to a private insurance plan for things like premiums, deductibles, and co-pays. Traditional Medicare plans are usually coupled with a separate prescription coverage plan called Part D.

Medicare Advantage is offered through private insurance companies and usually bundles several parts of Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans have become hugely popular because they provide savings in the form of very low premiums and yearly out-of-pocket caps. Some Medicare Advantage plans also offer dental or vision coverage, and fold in Part D drug coverage. But MA plans may limit which providers you can see and require you to get approval for some procedures.

Medicare Advantage has a different open enrollment period from traditional Medicare. The Medicare Advantage open enrollment period starts on Jan. 1 and closes March 31 each year, enabling only those enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan to adjust their coverage.”

I've been outspoken in calling out Albanese for pursuing his free Qantas upgrades, but the pearl clutching from the Opposition and News Corp is so obviously disingenuous because they sat unperturbed through corruption scandal after corruption scandal from the Morrison Government.

There needs to be a uniformed reset of what behaviour we accept in Canberra... it's probably up to our Independents to set that standard, because clearly none or the major parties are going to do it.

The below is an excerpt from a post I made four years ago detailing just SOME of the Coalitions corruption scandals.

#SpyGate
Bo 'Nick' Zhao, a Chinese born Australian goes to ASIO telling them he's been offered a $1million from the Chinese Government to run as a Liberal Party candidate and then infiltrate the Australian Parliament as a Chinese Spy. 

He then turns up dead in a Melbourne hotel room in March. 

Enter Gladys Liu, the Liberal Candidate with a host of concerning connections to the Chinese Government who earns Liberal pre-selection thanks to miraculously raising a million dollars in donations. 

Fairfax then discovered a photo of Liu at her home with Nick Zhao in the back ground. 

Gladys is now the Liberal Member for Chisolm.

#SignGate
Liberal Candidates Gladys Liu and Josh Frydenberg both have Mandarin signs at polling booths in the colours of the Australian Electoral Commission branding telling Chinese citizens how to vote (by putting 1 next to the Liberal Candidate). There is no Liberal Party branding on the sign 

Liberal officials admit in court that the signs were designed to convey the appearance of official electoral commission material.

#LetterGate
Angus Taylor writes a public letter, published in the Daily Telegraph, to Sydney Mayor Clover Moore criticising her for her millions of dollars of domestic travel. The document he quotes is a forgery. 

Taylor refuses to disclose where he got the fake document from and refuses all Freedom of Information requests from the media that might give an insight.

#foxtelgate
The Coalition granted $30million to Foxtel, ostensibly to assist with ""sports coverage"" (whilst simultaneously slashing ABC funding). There was no public release of any conditions or oversight regarding the funding. News Corp, the largest newspaper owner in Australia and the owners of Foxtel, vigorously and unapologetically proceeds to support the Coalition whilst attacking Labor in the next election.

Over $100million in grants to sporting clubs were handed out according to a colour coded spreadsheet showing if the clubs were in marginal or potentially winnable electorates. 

The Government overruled the recommendations of the Sports Commission 300 times, instead giving photo ops to LNP candidates just before the election. 

The PM denied any involvement despite extensive email evidence showing his office was calling the shots.

#Robodebt
In 2016, the Government set up an automated debt recovery mechanism to recover welfare overpayments. 

However the calculations used by the system were deeply flawed and demanded repayments from thousands who hadn't been overpaid a cent. 

To make matters worse, the new process reversed the onus of proof on the recipient to prove they hadn't been overpaid. 

Over 2000 Australians died after receiving Robodebt notices. A large (although unknown) number have been attributed to self harm. 

In 2020, the Government finally admitted the system was flawed and paid back or forgave $1.2billion in debts.

#SharmaShareGate
As the Government was deciding whether or not to bail out Virgin Airlines, MP Dave Sharma purchased shares in Virgin's biggest competitor, Qantas. 

Months later, just before Morrison announced an agreement with CSL to make millions of doses of a Covid vaccine, Sharma just happened to have bought CSL shares.

***Who Am I:*** I am Jeff Casimir. I started one of the first bootcamps in 2011 and am the Executive Director at the Turing School of Software and Design. I have more experience in bootcamps and technical hiring than anyone else in the world. 

Tech hiring continues to improve. My reasonable hope is that experienced folks are able to earn promotions or find a new role within 12 weeks. My hope for entry-level folks is that strong skills and a diligent job hunt will lead them to a role in 3-6 months.

What I want to see in the market is **movement**. A year ago we heard a lot about ""hiring freezes"" which are, of course, terrible for the job market. Now we're seeing a lot of movement across experience levels, industries, and geographies.

I pulled a list of Turing grads who've been hired or promoted in the lst 90 days. I removed the ones that are outside the tech field / roles not related to the training they received at Turing. I decided to add just a bit of obfuscation here because I'm not trying to dox people, but if you want to dig deeper on any of it you can likely find the individuals on LinkedIn.

"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)",SmallCapStocks,1gaf5fb,2024-10-23 12:42:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallCapStocks/comments/1gaf5fb/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,MightBeneficial3302,,"In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

https://preview.redd.it/wtsrvtveajwd1.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b5102e86c726c006c9f87d1efbbd89e67a2926b

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

https://preview.redd.it/plsxg71lajwd1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=375cd979fc524a1c765667e81878fd1cc4491e80

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver).

The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase.

With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.  
Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.  
In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.  
The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

Gold Reaches an All-Time High,MetalBulls,1g9li4a,2024-10-22 11:53:41,5,0.86,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetalBulls/comments/1g9li4a/gold_reaches_an_alltime_high/,MightBeneficial3302,Due Diligence 📝,"Have you been keeping an eye on gold prices lately? If not, you might be surprised to learn that gold has hit new record highs, fueled by several key factors that have investors rushing to this timeless safe haven. Growing uncertainties surrounding the Middle East conflict, concerns over the upcoming US election, and a wave of central banks easing their monetary policies are all playing a part in this surge.

As the world watches these events unfold, the demand for gold is rising. Historically, gold has been a reliable store of value when everything else seems volatile. As central banks—especially the US Federal Reserve—cut interest rates to stimulate their economies, gold tends to perform well. This is because low interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t pay dividends or interest, making it more appealing.

https://preview.redd.it/j04386hgxbwd1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0af873c3ee999a15b80352d8bf13611abe44586

Let’s talk numbers. Spot gold prices rose 0.32%, reaching $2,730 per ounce, while gold futures on the Comex climbed by 0.59% to $2,746 per ounce—new record highs for the fourth straight day! These figures point to a strong, sustained rise in gold’s value, and many analysts believe it’s not over yet.

Here’s an interesting thought: why does gold react so strongly to central banks’ decisions? Recently, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut its benchmark mortgage rates more than expected, causing commodity prices—including gold—to jump. And it’s not just China. Central banks worldwide, like the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Fed, are lowering rates to try and stimulate their economies.

Another driving factor behind gold’s meteoric rise is escalating geopolitical tensions. For example, in the Middle East, increasing conflict—like the recent Hezbollah drone explosion in Israel—is pushing investors toward gold as a hedge against instability. Even the upcoming US presidential election has markets on edge, with polls indicating a tight race. Historically, periods of political uncertainty tend to benefit gold.

Given the current environment—uncertainty in global politics, central banks easing, and ongoing conflicts—it’s hard to predict where gold will go next. But many analysts think gold’s rise could continue. With interest rates at historic lows and economic uncertainty showing no signs of disappearing soon, the conditions seem favorable for gold to remain in the spotlight.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) Gold is advancing in the precious metals sector, focusing on **gold** and **silver**. With both near-term production and long-term exploration projects, the company is poised to generate revenue while expanding its resource base. Its flagship **Lucero Mine** in Peru, known for its high-grade deposits, is set to resume production soon.

Element79 Gold has outlined an ambitious plan for its upcoming activities, starting with a financing round of up to CAD $2,000,000, aimed at funding the fall-winter work campaigns. The funds will be allocated with 60% towards drilling and 40% towards project management, operations, and investor relations. The company plans to kick off a 2,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign at the Clover project, building on results from 104 shallow holes to begin resource discovery.

In addition, Element79 is focusing on completing due diligence for the tailings with the potential to generate immediate revenue through a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) and Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). The company also plans to negotiate community contracts to secure surface rights for 3 to 10 years, ensuring long-term access to mining sites.

At the Lucero Mine, a 1,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign will target resource discovery while mapping and preparing for surface drilling by 2025. Furthermore, Element79 will assess data from Lucero, Clover, and tailings to refine its plans for 2025, including further drilling, MRE updates, and PEA preparations. The permitting process for plant construction, tailings processing, and surface drilling is expected to take 4 to 6 months, ensuring that the groundwork is laid for future operations.

**Gold or Treasury Bonds?** 

Bank of America analysts suggest that the increasing U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio, along with rising bond yields, may push more investors toward gold. As the Treasury sells more bonds, yields rise, and bond prices fall. Historically, this would hurt gold, but now, even with higher rates, gold remains strong. In fact, BofA predicts gold could hit $3,000 per ounce, calling it the “ultimate safe-haven asset.”

Gold has surged more than 30% this year, reaching $2,700 per ounce. This rise continues despite the U.S. budget deficit reaching $1.8 trillion and interest payments on the national debt climbing to $950 billion.

As central banks worldwide diversify their reserves away from U.S. debt, gold’s appeal grows. With spending pressures from climate change and defense needs, the future may see gold as the last standing safe investment. Bank of America notes, “If markets become reluctant to absorb all the debt, gold may be the final safe-haven asset.”"

As central banks—especially the US Federal Reserve—cut interest rates to stimulate their economies, gold tends to perform well. This is because low interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t pay dividends or interest, making it more appealing.

https://preview.redd.it/zwin1odlxbwd1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=1051d54b3d6bc8e6b350f438c54e9d444e799f64

Let’s talk numbers. Spot gold prices rose 0.32%, reaching $2,730 per ounce, while gold futures on the Comex climbed by 0.59% to $2,746 per ounce—new record highs for the fourth straight day! These figures point to a strong, sustained rise in gold’s value, and many analysts believe it’s not over yet.

Here’s an interesting thought: why does gold react so strongly to central banks’ decisions? Recently, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut its benchmark mortgage rates more than expected, causing commodity prices—including gold—to jump. And it’s not just China. Central banks worldwide, like the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Fed, are lowering rates to try and stimulate their economies.

Another driving factor behind gold’s meteoric rise is escalating geopolitical tensions. For example, in the Middle East, increasing conflict—like the recent Hezbollah drone explosion in Israel—is pushing investors toward gold as a hedge against instability. Even the upcoming US presidential election has markets on edge, with polls indicating a tight race. Historically, periods of political uncertainty tend to benefit gold.

Given the current environment—uncertainty in global politics, central banks easing, and ongoing conflicts—it’s hard to predict where gold will go next. But many analysts think gold’s rise could continue. With interest rates at historic lows and economic uncertainty showing no signs of disappearing soon, the conditions seem favorable for gold to remain in the spotlight.

**My Stock Pick for November: Element79**

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) Gold is advancing in the precious metals sector, focusing on **gold** and **silver**. With both near-term production and long-term exploration projects, the company is poised to generate revenue while expanding its resource base. Its flagship **Lucero Mine** in Peru, known for its high-grade deposits, is set to resume production soon. Historically, Lucero produced **40,000 ounces of gold equivalent** annually, with an average grade of **19.0 grams per ton** in gold equivalent. The mine’s underground workings extend over **16 kilometers**, highlighting its significant reserves.

Element79 Gold has outlined an ambitious plan for its upcoming activities, starting with a financing round of up to CAD $2,000,000, aimed at funding the fall-winter work campaigns. The funds will be allocated with 60% towards drilling and 40% towards project management, operations, and investor relations. The company plans to kick off a 2,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign at the Clover project, building on results from 104 shallow holes to begin resource discovery.

In addition, Element79 is focusing on completing due diligence for the tailings with the potential to generate immediate revenue through a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) and Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). The company also plans to negotiate community contracts to secure surface rights for 3 to 10 years, ensuring long-term access to mining sites.

At the Lucero Mine, a 1,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign will target resource discovery while mapping and preparing for surface drilling by 2025. Furthermore, Element79 will assess data from Lucero, Clover, and tailings to refine its plans for 2025, including further drilling, MRE updates, and PEA preparations. The permitting process for plant construction, tailings processing, and surface drilling is expected to take 4 to 6 months, ensuring that the groundwork is laid for future operations.

**Gold or Treasury Bonds?** 

Bank of America analysts suggest that the increasing U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio, along with rising bond yields, may push more investors toward gold. As the Treasury sells more bonds, yields rise, and bond prices fall. Historically, this would hurt gold, but now, even with higher rates, gold remains strong. In fact, BofA predicts gold could hit $3,000 per ounce, calling it the “ultimate safe-haven asset.”

Gold has surged more than 30% this year, reaching $2,700 per ounce. This rise continues despite the U.S. budget deficit reaching $1.8 trillion and interest payments on the national debt climbing to $950 billion.

https://preview.redd.it/k3wszyanxbwd1.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b38683e3794884628e9efc71ef5be83fd491d5

As central banks worldwide diversify their reserves away from U.S. debt, gold’s appeal grows. With spending pressures from climate change and defense needs, the future may see gold as the last standing safe investment. Bank of America notes, “If markets become reluctant to absorb all the debt, gold may be the final safe-haven asset.”"

"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)",PennyCatalysts,1g6mh3f,2024-10-18 12:34:48,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyCatalysts/comments/1g6mh3f/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,MightBeneficial3302,,"In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Gambling: A Bad Bet,Healing_Deliverance,1g0we14,2024-10-10 19:35:10,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healing_Deliverance/comments/1g0we14/gambling_a_bad_bet/,1John2_3-6,,"\*Does God Oppose Gambling?

\*Is Gambling Sin?

\*What Does the Bible Say?

According to St. Augustine, “The devil invented gambling.” Whether or not one accepts Augustine’s conviction, gambling has been around for thousands of years. Augustus Caesar is said to have sponsored the first known public lottery in order to raise funds to repair the city of Rome. The Bible records that Roman soldiers gambled for the garments of Christ (Matthew 27:35), an action predicted in the Old Testament (Psalm 22:18). In the latter eighteenth century, lottery proceeds helped to fortify Colonial America against the British. But if the history of its use is long, so is that of its misuse. Loaded dice were found in the ruins of ancient Pompeii. Corruption, it seems, is the inevitable bedfellow of gambling.

Corruption notwithstanding, various polls and studies have revealed that, in some form or another, gambling is practiced or endorsed by the majority of Americans. One reliable estimate is that 80 percent of adults gamble at least occasionally. Other estimates range from two-thirds of the population up to 88 percent.1 Obviously, this indicates that many Christians, too, are playing the office football pool, the lottery, bingo, slots, poker, horses, etc., and have invested some percentage of the 329 billion dollars gambled in the United States in 1992.



**WHAT IS GAMBLING?**

By definition, it is to bet money on the outcome of a game, contest, or other event. It means to play a game of chance for money or other stakes.

It is further defined as wagering money, or something of value, on an uncertain event whose outcome is dependent either wholly on chance or partly on chance and partly on skill. However one defines or assesses gambling, one thread runs throughout its entire fabric from the friendly Saturday night card game to the social club bingo to the full blown casino—the gains of the winners are made at the expense of the losers, and the gain is secured without rendering its equivalent either in service or in value. Thus, if a game of chance was played solely for amusement, it is not gambling. It only becomes gambling when money or valuables are wagered. But in order for one to win, another must lose. And in gambling, losers always far out number winners. So the three elements involved in the gambling equation are: 1) the betting of money or valuables; 2) the determination of the winner by luck, chance, or uncertain events; and 3) winners profiting at the expense of the losers.



**GAMBLING AND DISCIPLESHIP**

Traditionally, Christians have held three different views on the subject of gambling:

1) The **ROMAN CATHOLIC VIEW** does not condemn gambling on a small scale. The danger lies in its excess. They consider small wagers, bingos, friendly bets, and raffles for worthy causes as amusements that inflict no hardship on those who participate. In fact, in many communities, Roman Catholic church-sponsored gambling, bingos, raffles, Las Vegas Nights, etc., are common occurrences. According to the New Catholic Encyclopedia, people are entitled to gamble as long as they do not render themselves incapable of fulfilling duties incumbent upon them by reason of justice or charity.

The problems with this view surface in the following letter to U.S. Catholic magazine:

“The Catholic Church has taught me to gamble. Bingo and raffles are absolutely no different from lotteries. If the Catholic Church would take the lead and stop gambling, I would reconsider the idea of playing the lottery. If I am greedy, it is because it’s almost a sacrament in the Church.”

2) The **MAINLINE DENOMINATIONAL VIEW**, while not holding church-sponsored raffles or bingos or putting their official “sanction” on gambling, does not attach any great harm in it, either, if practiced in moderation. This segment of Christianity would, however, most likely oppose its legislation on a major scale.

3) The **BIBLICAL VIEW** denounces gambling as a moral evil on any scale and in every form, public or private. Most evangelicals hold this view.



**SO, WHAT’S WRONG WITH GAMBLING?**



**1) GAMBLING CONTRADICTS THE BIBLICAL, JUDEO-CHRISTIAN WORK ETHIC.** God ordained labor and work in order to earn one’s income. “For this is the will of God….that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you. That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3, 11-12). The non-laboring, unproductive life of the professional gambler is condemned in other passages, such as 2 Thessalonians 3:10,12: “For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.”

In Christianity, one is to eat the bread his own labors have produced. In gambling, the winner eats the loser’s bread. Thus, gambling perverts the biblical concept of honest, useful employment. It substitutes a desire to obtain something for nothing, a “get rich quick” mentality, even if your gain comes at another’s loss. It is a remarkably similar mindset to that of the criminal who seeks to obtain what he did not earn at the expense of another.



**2) IN HONEST EARNINGS, THERE IS PRODUCTIVITY AND EXCHANGE.** One exchanges cash at the market for its equivalent value in goods. One gives the factory an honest eight hours of labor and productivity in exchange for a way or salary. In gambling, however, there is no productivity. Instead, gain is secured without rendering in service or in value an equivalent of the gains obtained. In gambling, everyone loses, even the “winner.” How? Winning plants a seed of deception in one’s thinking that perhaps this could become a way of life or an answer to all problems. In fact, it enslaves people to yet another of Satan’s clever bondages and addictions. Sadly, even when the gambler wins (which is seldom), his winnings quickly disappear. Casinos don’t stay in business by losing. As someone said, “The trouble with hitting the jackpot on a slot machine is that it takes so long to put the money back into the machine.”

Scripture warns, “Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathered by labour shall increase” (Proverbs 13:11). Furthermore, “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing” (Proverbs 10:2).



**3) IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, GAMBLING IS NO BETTER THAN ROBBERY AND FRAUD.** It offers a set of false hopes to people with certain predispositions and is known to especially prey on those who can least afford to lose but who ultimately do just that. In that sense its end result is no different than robbery.

A number of studies on lottery play have found that ticket sales are greatest in low-income, urban areas. Per capita sales in inner city Detroit, for example, are three times higher than sales in the suburbs. Lottery sales have also been found to decline in areas where the level of education is higher.3

Two Duke University economists, Charles T. Clotfelter and Philip J. Cook, painstakingly documented the long-held suspicions that the poor and uneducated are the lottery’s best customers. Their book, Selling Hope, describes how many states have designed clever, sophisticated advertising campaigns to especially target this most vulnerable market. The authors found that 10 percent of lottery players account for 50 percent of sales.4 All of this tends to work like Robin Hood in reverse. Citing the practice of grant recipients exchanging public assistance checks for lottery tickets, one Detroit minister said, “The state gives them money and then figures out a way to get it back. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.”5 Through lottery-style gambling, what little the masses of the poor have is taken away in exchange for a false hope (anywhere from 7 million– to 85 million-to-one odds) of becoming a winner. But surveys conducted by state lotteries show that few players understand just how minute their chances are of winning. In Michigan, legislative attempts to force the lottery to disclose the odds of winning were resisted by lottery officials who claimed such disclosures would discourage playing and diminish the effectiveness of their advertising. Clotfelter and Cook said that if state lotteries were held to the same truth in advertising as private sweepstakes, they’d be shut down by the Federal Trade Commission.



**4. GAMBLING PERVERTS MORAL CHARACTER**. Ben Franklin said that “those who lie down with dogs wake up with fleas.” This is Franklin’s version of the biblical principle, “Bad company corrupts good morals” (1 Corinthians 15:33). The fact is, gambling hangs out with bad company! This is true even in legalized gambling. It is always accompanied by a myriad of evils, such as organized crime, protection rackets, police and political corruption, prostitution, loan sharking, alcohol, and drugs.

William Webster, while serving as director of the FBI, said in 1985, “We know of no situation in which legalized gambling was in place where we did not eventually have organized crime.”6

Illinois State Police Director Terry Gainer echoed Webster’s sentiment stating that legalized gambling’s “social and criminal price is too high.”7

George Washington called it “the child of avarice, the brother of iniquity and the father of mischief.”



**IT IS A MORAL EVIL TO DEPRIVE ONE’S FAMILY**

Gambling is taking a heavy toll on the American family as well. Approximately 8 to 10 million Americans are addicted to gambling. The suffering they both inflict and endure is virtually incalculable. Valerie Lorenz, executive director of the National Center for Pathological Gambling, said, “People don’t see the devastation and the despair and the pain that we see. The person out there in the community only sees that there’s a million-dollar lottery and thinks: ‘Let’s buy a few tickets and maybe I can win and pay back all my bills and take a nice vacation.’ That person does not think about the gambling addict, about the broken home, about the suicide that accompanies gambling addiction.”8

How truly rings the Bible’s warning that, “He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house” (Proverbs 15:27).

It’s time we realized that behind all of the glitter, greed, and glamour of big scale casino gambling lies the grime. While the atmosphere portrayed is one of excitement, luxury, and indulgence, all the showgirls and glitz only thinly mask the depression, heartbreak and despair. One can’t help wondering how many families’ lives would be enriched if gambling were to disappear.



**5. GAMBLING VIOLATES GOD’S LAWS AGAINST GREED AND COVETOUSNESS.** To put it pure and simple, gamblers are motivated by greed, here defined as coveting wealth and the desire to acquire something for nothing. According to the Bible, there are only two legitimate ways to obtain wealth: first, earn it by hard work and wise investments (2 Thessalonians 3:10; Luke 19:1-27); second, by inheritance or gift (2 Corinthians 12:14). Gambling does not fall into any of these categories. Gambling is not work, for the gambler hopes to acquire wealth without working. It certainly cannot be considered an investment in anything, neither can any money won be considered a gift because it was obtained from losers who were hopeful of winning, not given as a gift or inherited.

Numerous scriptures warn of the grave spiritual dangers of covetousness and greed: (cf. Proverbs 15:27; 21:25-26; 23:4; Matthew 6:19-21, 24; 13:22; 16:26; Romans 13:9; Ephesians 5:3; Hebrews 13:5; 1 John 2:15).

The Apostle Paul reminds us that satisfaction in life comes from contentment and complete trust in God:

“But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be there with content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows” (1 Timothy 6:6-10).



Chicago-area pastor Bill Hybels discerningly put it:

“Part of what motivates a gambler is the hope for a windfall without having to submit to the discipline and rigors of working and budgeting and saving… There’s the draw of easy money associated with gambling, there’s the hope for the quick hit, and it might even be more complicated than that.

…At the root of wanting a windfall in the first place, is a deep, gnawing dissatisfaction with your current level of provision that God has made for you in your life. Maybe underneath it all is a monster that lurks in the shadows of almost every person’s heart, the monster called “More.”9

Christians can seek to better themselves and improve their circumstances by rendering honest, ethical labor and trusting God in their situation. We cannot, however, hope to bypass God’s plan for success by falling for gambling’s lure of easy money.



**6. GAMBLING ALWAYS PRODUCES A DETERIORATION OF SOCIETY.** Even legalized gambling on a large scale, such as in Las Vegas, Reno, and Atlantic City, has brought inner city blight, decay, and despair and has been a major contributor to soaring crime rates. In an article by Bob Gill that appeared in the February 1991 issue of the Business Journal of New Jersey, Atlantic City is referred to as “being a con man’s paradise, the land of broken promise, the monument to greed, and the supreme headquarters of tackiness.” He describes how the glitzy casinos stand in broad contrast to the “gray, decaying homes, hotels, and shelters; the stray animals; the poverty.” The casinos had promised jobs, improvements, and huge new revenues. Gambling would spell paradise and prosperity for all. It was a great promise. But it never happened. Unless, as Gill asserts, “people have been fooled all along and paradise actually consists of slums, porno parlors, and empty lots filled with weeds and litter.” He says the city’s residents feel the casinos have betrayed them. In a survey on Atlantic City’s quality of life conducted by the South Jersey Center for Public Affairs and completed in May 1987, 69 percent of the respondents felt the casinos have done too little for the people who live in Atlantic City; and 71 percent said only the casinos have benefited from their presence in the city. The promised new housing never developed, either. In fact, the casinos have had an opposite effect. Land prices have gone up while prospective tenants have not emerged. Older housing was bought up and demolished by speculators, all of which has caused apartment shortages and dramatically escalating prices. Leroy Schoolfield, a boardwalk artist, says, “It’s hard for a single person to get a place to live. They want $600 a month for a room and a bathroom. It’s hard as hell to live.”10



**COMMUNITY DECLINE**

Furthermore, even small towns that turn to gambling for increased revenues find that all that glitters is not gold. Deadwood, South Dakota, for instance, has seen an increase in crime, traffic, and related noises; a loss of certain community-oriented retail businesses; and a change in the community’s social fabric. Locally owned businesses are being squeezed out. The city’s three car dealerships and other retail outlets are closed. Families are moving out, resulting in decreasing enrollment in schools, churches, and civic groups.

The Deadwood state prosecutor recently said that the 1989 legalization of poker, blackjack, and slot machines has helped increase the crime rate by nearly 70 percent. Court caseloads rose 71 percent. While bad checks were the major problem, felonies and misdemeanors related to physical assaults also increased. Forgery crimes rose 480 percent, burglaries 300 percent, and grand theft 1000 percent.11

One would be hard pressed to find a minister, social worker, psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health worker who considered legalized gambling a positive step for any community.



**7. GAMBLING IS POOR STEWARDSHIP OF GOD’S MONEY.** The scriptures teach that all Christians are stewards of God’s possessions. All that we have has actually been entrusted to us by God who will one day soon call us to account for our stewardship. This principle is clearly seen in Jesus’ words in Luke 16:2: “give an account of thy stewardship…”

It is seen further in the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30) where it is clearly demonstrated that future rewards will largely depend on our present faithfulness to exercise wise management of our resources, money, time, and talents. Jesus also declares that those stewards who have squandered what the Lord entrusted to them will be cast into a place of outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 25:30).



**8. GAMBLING VIOLATES THE BIBLICAL MANDATE TO LOVE ONE’S NEIGHBOR** (Matthew 22:37-40). The Christian is to live in a state of brotherly love, always seeking the benefit, blessing, and welfare of others (cf. Mark 12:28-31; Luke 10:25-37; Romans 15:1-2; I Corinthians 10:24; 13:5). The gambler, however, has no “neighbors” in the Christian sense. He seeks only his own benefit, gain, and profit. He knows that in order to win, others must lose. In order for him to increase, others must decrease. This is just the opposite of the biblical concept of Christian life. We are to decrease while Christ in us increases (John 3:30). We are to seek the gain and blessings of others, not our own (1 Corinthians 10:24). Therefore, the command to love our neighbor rules out our gain at his loss even if he or she gambles willingly. The underlying consideration being, not that “they shouldn’t gamble if they didn’t want to lose,” but rather, how can a disciple of Christ accept an unearned, undeserved gain?

Furthermore, gambling places us in the unconscionable position of praying to win, which actually means praying for others to lose so we can win the money they worked for. Is this loving your neighbor? How appropriate are the words of James: “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts” (James 4:3).



**GAMBLING AND SUPERSTITION**

Gamblers are a superstitious lot. They cross their fingers, make the sign of the cross, wish for luck or whisper a prayer before they roll the dice or pull the handle on the slot machine. They pray for guidance to pick winning lottery numbers or to win the bingo or raffle. They play bingo with their lucky coin, bean, rabbit’s foot, 4-leaf clover, or other good-luck charm nearby. They wear their “lucky” shirt, shoes, or other item of clothing, and grasp for lucky numbers to play. How tragic for Christians to engage in a practice so rife with evils. The Bible declares:

“And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them” (Ephesians 5:11).



**9. THE PROBLEM WITH STATE-SPONSORED GAMBLING:**

The idea of legalized gambling helping a state to solve its financial problems is pure delusion and overlooks several vital considerations:



**A. IT IS INDECENT FOR A GOVERNMENT TO FINANCE ITSELF FROM THE MORAL WEAKNESSES OF ITS CITIZENS.** Those who are hurt the most are inevitably those who can least afford it. Gambling, in effect, becomes a “tax” that hits the poor the hardest. They are, after all, more susceptible to slick advertising campaigns that encourage fantasies of winning the big one. Clotfelter and Cook insist that “the relatively poor spend a much larger fraction of their income on lottery tickets than the relatively affluent.”

The two university professors also said that state lottery agencies are “very reluctant” to provide information on who plays the lottery. We know why. The revelation that the state-sponsored lottery exploits its own uneducated citizens and preys especially on the poor would be bad for business.



**B. IT PRODUCES A DOUBLE STANDARD OF MORALITY THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO LOSE RESPECT FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL AUTHORITY.** What is a crime for an individual citizen to do is legal for the state. Joe Citizen cannot offer roulette, blackjack, and slot machines in his place of business. It’s a crime for which he would be arrested! But the state can, and not only is it lawful, it is widely promoted and advertised. Such double standards cause a breakdown of respect for government and as much confusion as a parent who smokes or drinks yet insists that their children do not.



**C. LEGALIZED GAMBLING HAS PROVEN TO BE JUST AS DOMINATED BY ORGANIZED CRIME AS ILLEGAL GAMBLING.** The Commission on the Review of National Policy towards Gambling stated in its final report that though gambling is practiced by two-thirds of the American people and approved by perhaps 80% of the population, it, “Nevertheless,” the commission noted, “contributes more than any other single enterprise to police corruption in their cities and towns and to the well-being of the nation’s criminals.”12



**D. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED GAMBLING LESSENS THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH GAMBLING, LEADING TO INCREASED GAMBLING ADDICTION.** Until legalization, gambling was seen as sinful, immoral, and illegal. Now it’s viewed as an act of civic responsibility! If you buy lottery tickets, do charitable gambling, or purchase chances in the local raffle, you are supporting your community, raising money for the homeless, advancing education, and considered a good citizen!

This dramatic change in the way gambling is viewed has also had a powerful impact on American youth. A recent study found that the percentage of southern California high school students who participate in gambling in any form rose by 40 percent after that state’s lottery was introduced in 1985.13 As a society, we would do well to heed the advice of Ben Franklin, “Keep flax from fire, youth from gaming.”



**E. STATE-SPONSORED GAMBLING BREAKS DOWN THE RESISTANCE OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT GAMBLE OTHERWISE.** Now that gambling has “come out of the closet,” multitudes are attracted to it like moths to flame. The result has been predictable. The number of gambling addicts has doubled during the eighties, a decade of dramatic state lottery growth. The nineties are sure to see that number quadruple.



**F. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED GAMBLING HAS PUT STATES IN THE LUDICROUS POSITION OF ADVERTISING THEIR DUBIOUS PRODUCT.** That means placing such misleading ads as “Instant Cash” and “The shortest route to Easy Street,” etc. According to Curt Suplee of the Washington Post, “Statistically you are seven times more likely to be hit by lightning than to become a millionaire in state lotteries.”

Besides painting such a picture of instant prosperity, the ads promote materialism and the fantasy of the life of luxury without labor, an image particularly harmful to the poor.



**G. THE PROMISED PROCEEDS AND REVENUES OF LEGALIZED GAMBLING NEVER LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS.** Proponents promise “more money to pay police.” But crime rates soar up to 1000 percent, and so many new police have to be hired that the money for raises disappears.

Another falsehood is “We’ll use the money to finance education. New schools! Needed improvements! Teacher raises! Let’s legalize gambling for the kids’ sake!” The fact is, when gambling is legalized, kids are hurt the most. More families are deprived, more parents become addicts, there is less money for normal family expenditures, and more kids quit school. The idea of spending years in a classroom to further their education pales in comparison to a glitzy casino job making instant money. Then there is the reality of unemployment actually created by legalized gambling and casinos. The new casinos vie with established community small businesses for the already stretched entertainment dollar. Most of the small businesses can’t compete against the glitzy, multimillion dollar, slick-marketed casinos and are soon out of business. It happened in Atlantic City. It happened in Deadwood. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, lost their jobs. Furthermore, when casinos move in, people move out, fleeing the high-traffic and high- crime areas surrounding the casino.



**TAINTING YOUR TESTIMONY**

Dear Christian, how can you even consider casting such a stumbling block before others? If you gamble, even moderately, what picture does that paint for others around you? Could they not cite you as a justification for engaging in this wicked activity? Perhaps someone will gamble and then their children will suffer because of your example. And what of your own children? When you buy lottery tickets, aren’t you instilling in them the conviction that gambling is a normal Christian practice?

Famed British preacher C. H. Spurgeon said, “The soldiers at the foot of the cross threw dice for my Savior’s garments. And I have never heard the rattling of dice but I have conjured up the dreadful scene of Christ on his cross, and gamblers at the foot of it, with their dice bespattered by his blood. I do not hesitate to say that of all sins, there is none that more surely damns men, and worse than that, makes them the devil’s helpers to damn others, than gambling.”



**GAMBLING, A BAD BET FOR ANYONE**

There is also the danger of shrugging one’s shoulders over issues such as this. Perhaps you are tempted to think that gambling is no big deal and harmless, especially in moderation. Addressing that very argument, Billy Graham said, “The appeal of gambling is somewhat understandable. There is something alluring about getting something for nothing. I realize that, and that is where the sin lies. Gambling of any kind amounts to theft by permission. The coin is flipped, the dice are rolled, or the horses run, and somebody rakes in that which belongs to another. The Bible says, ‘In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.’ (Genesis 3:19) It doesn’t say, ‘By the flip of a coin shalt thou eat thy lunch.’ I realize that in most petty gambling no harm is intended, but the principle is the same as in big gambling. The difference is only the amount of money involved.”14

There is, without question, an almost inexplicable urge within mankind to gamble. It stirs the passions, and entices with visions of riches, excitement, and pleasure. It calls and beckons and makes extravagant promises to those who play. But like the mythological Sirens whose eerie songs lured ancient mariners to their death, gambling delivers only destruction. It is a mirage, a false hope, a wisp, a dream that quickly transforms into a nightmare of pain and misery. Like the devil, it lies. And as we have seen, gambling and the precepts of Scripture are hopelessly irreconcilable. Simply stated, gambling is sin. It is sin whether one gambles with little or with much, and it is sin whether one gambles in a casino or a church! Satan himself has painted and perfumed gambling to make it seem harmless, but that appearance is a masquerade. Gambling is a spiritual minefield: it appears safe to walk through, but in reality it is pregnant with death at every step.

Friend, by gambling, you link yourself arm in arm to the many who go in at the wide and broad way that leads to destruction. Remember Jesus’ admonition: “Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it” (Matthew 7:14).



**DON’T GAMBLE WITH GOD**

If you have not received Christ as Savior, you are taking the greatest gamble of all, and your own soul is at stake! Repent of your sins and call upon Christ now before it is too late. Don’t gamble with eternity in the balance.



**WHAT YOU MUST DO TO BE SAVED:**

.Believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins (1 Corinthians 15:3).

.Renounce sin and turn away from it (Acts 2:38).

.Pray, and ask God to forgive you of all your sins (1 John 1:9).

.Invite Christ to come and live inside of you (Revelation 3:20).

.Completely surrender your life to Him (Luke 9:23), and He will make you an entirely new person.

“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17).

Clover vs ALHC 10/04/24 - market cap equalization,Healthcare_Anon,1fwgsbd,2024-10-04 22:54:31,53,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1fwgsbd/clover_vs_alhc_100424_market_cap_equalization/,Moocao123,Due Diligence,"Greetings Healthcare company investors,

As we are now Friday after market close, and even after-hours markets are closed, I thought now would be the best time to compare the 2 Medicare Advantage companies that became public in 2021, which are Clover Health and Alignment Health. As our subreddit initially had a large influx of Clover Health investors, I am sure this segment will be of particular interest. As usual, our disclaimers:

\*\*\* Both RainyFriedTofu and Moocao123 has positions in Clover Health. The information provided is not meant as financial advice, please be advised of the potential bias and decide whether the information provided is within your risk consideration. \*\*

\*\*\* ***This is not financial advice, nor is there any financial advice within.Shout-out to the AMC/GME apes for having me to write this\*\*\****

\*\*\* Please do not utilize this content without author authorization \*\*\*

\*\*\* Chatgpt4 or any AI platform was not utilized to write the content of this post, and I am the sole author to this post. I personally do not think AI can write anything noteworthy of our subreddit caliber, and neither Rainy nor I have used chatgpt4 or any AI for our content \*\*\*

**Preamble:**

08/20/24: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1ezu7uu/clover\_vs\_alhc\_dd\_082024\_market\_cap\_equalization/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1ezu7uu/clover_vs_alhc_dd_082024_market_cap_equalization/)

09/03/24: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1f8iaui/clover\_vs\_alhc\_dd\_090324\_market\_cap\_dissociation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1f8iaui/clover_vs_alhc_dd_090324_market_cap_dissociation/)

The purpose of linking these 2 posts is to illustrate why I thought the month of September seems to be a month of dislocation - despite a clear differentiation of the 2 company's path forward, somehow one company is being valued at a higher market cap than another

**What are some of the measures of market capitalization determination:**

RainyFriedTofu post 09/07/24: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1fb84t4/reminder\_on\_why\_clover\_health\_is\_undervalued\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1fb84t4/reminder_on_why_clover_health_is_undervalued_and/)

Enterprise Value (EV): This is a more complete measure of a company's overall value because it includes the company's debt and subtracts cash. EV gives a fuller picture of the cost to acquire the company. Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt - Cash.

Price-to-sale (P/S) ratio: This is useful for companies with little or no profits. It compares the stock price to the company’s revenue.

Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio: This compares the market value of a company to its book value (assets minus liabilities). It’s especially useful for financial or asset-heavy companies.

Free Cash Flow: Cash flow available after expenses (including capital expenditures) can be a strong indicator of a company’s value.

One thing Rainy forgot: Price over earnings ratio

The P/E ratio is **calculated by dividing the market value price per share by the company's earnings per share (EPS)**. A high P/E ratio can mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. A low P/E ratio might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings.

**Why are these measures important:** It allows for investors to determine ""fair value"". It sounds easy, but it is actually quite difficult. It is like asking if Wagyu Beef deserves to be priced differently than Prime Beef, or if Miyazaki A5 Wagyu should be priced almost 5-10x that of American Wagyu beef. Who determines that price point? Is there a ""quality"" difference? Thankfully for stocks, the measures are actually easier than just one's individual preference for beef. The basics will do.

**Tesla vs Ford:**

https://preview.redd.it/jp9dlfcniusd1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d8a382a7b3271663108016957987cd584a784d

Why am I using Tesla vs Ford as an example? Tesla is worth almost a whopping ***20x*** that of Ford, valued at \~ 800B compared to Ford of 42B. *What makes Tesla different than Ford, despite lower vehicle sales per quarter compared to Ford?*

https://preview.redd.it/45fzr84sjusd1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7abbbdb06f027e14350ae81a13c27293c31db3e

If you didn't see it much from here, neither did I. What I can say is that Tesla is considered a tech stock, but Ford is considered a car stock, and the valuations are different. Ford is TRYING to make its EV competitive, but so far hasn't succeeded. Tesla also has other businesses coming online as well, such as electrification/charging (real), robotaxi (personally I find this fluff and more Elon's hot air), and Elon Musk's reputation (going down every day, in my opinion). In addition, Tesla is part of the Mag 7, being compared to the likes of MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, META, NVDA, AMZN.  People WANT to own these stocks, because of their explosive potentials. No one likes to own F (even if the dividend yield is 5.68%, literally higher than the US treasuries being sold right now)

**Why are you explaining this to me?**

Because I think people have to understand fundamentally about stocks - the purpose to own a stock *is to own a part of the company and its future growth potential*. Buffett's rule: Price is what you pay; value is what you get. When you purchase a stock, you are purchasing a piece of a company that you *have to determine value*. The price is NOT the value. In fact, throughout these past 6 months, ***both Rainy and I have been screaming this***. Next Buffett Rule: You don’t get paid for activity, you only get paid for being right.

**Why we think we were right:**

https://preview.redd.it/8dna3qjtlusd1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=c867100282f55d783bb65ea5cf9b87d43cf8f54b

After the month of September, we are finally back to market cap equalization between the 2 MA companies. During the months of August-October, we had the following news for each company:

CLOV: [Vivek open market purchase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insider-buying-vivek-garipalli-acquires-230509188.html) (08/13/24), [SaaS with The Iowa Clinic](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CLOV/the-iowa-clinic-signs-multi-year-agreement-with-counterpart-health-y981v3zq6sbg.html) (09/03/24), STAR rating (pending 10/07/24-10/11/24).

ALHC: [CEO ](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/alignment-healthcare-ceo-sells-shares-worth-over-1m-93CH-3622158)and [CFO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insider-sale-director-joseph-konowiecki-050701441.html) sells stock.

**Value:**

ALHC: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1ei2vu4/alhc\_q2\_2024\_earnings\_analysis\_earnings\_call10q/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1ei2vu4/alhc_q2_2024_earnings_analysis_earnings_call10q/)

Clover: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1eoiq7k/clover\_q2\_2024\_earnings\_analysis\_earnings\_call/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1eoiq7k/clover_q2_2024_earnings_analysis_earnings_call/)

Now use the Excel charts and my terminologies again and determine ***value***. Again, use P/E. Remember, P = multiples x earnings + asset/cash on hand. Clover only has 1 quarter that is +EPS, and ALHC has zero. This requires a little bit of projection, but the comparison is quite simple: which company would you think has more value? ***Once you find that out, THEN determine the price.***

*Use Enterprise value to compare, then use P/E vs P/S vs P/FCF. Remember though, Clover had a very large revenue in 2022-2023 and still was punished as the P/S didn't work.*

**2024 Price:**

**Clover:** did not reach $2B until 10/04/24, lowest price = $300M.

**ALHC:** Highest = $2.25B, lowest = 800M.

**Conclusion:**

It wasn't until *today* that we have pricing parity again between the 2 MA companies that became public in 2021. Clover is a SPAC, and ALHC is an IPO. I personally believe that the meme association with CLOV hampered its reputation, forcing Andrew Toy to *work his butt off* to deliver shareholder value.

We seen this with The Iowa Clinic deal unveiling - that SaaS deal was in the works in 2023 (for those who don't believe us, it is OK. We don't *need* your approval. We know how these deals take time, but you can believe a Medical Practice CFO/COO only needs 1 month to decide on a EHR switch), the white papers that seem to pop out every couple of months, and the patents that just keep rolling. *Clover is a Tech company that uses an Insurer status for software development, and will market it to contain cost and comply with CMS V28*. Don't worry though, someone on the internet tried to convince me it isn't developing an Electronic Health Records system so it must be true.

So we have 2 health insurers presented in front of us. One of them made GAAP profit in 24Q2, has a SaaS contract signed, has a lot of patents, and probably has an EHR system. The other didn't make GAAP profit and doesn't forecast itself to have one for any quarters in 2024, does not have SaaS at all, has a lot more revenue, and does not have an EHR being developed. *And they are still valued AT THE SAME PRICE.*

I would also like to reiterate again what our subreddit stands for: ***We do not provide financial advice, nor do we intend to do so.***

**Never trust the internet for your information, and cross reference every single piece of information.** Your money is your nest egg, let no one tell you what to do, or allow yourself to be led by unverified information. If you are uncomfortable with single stock investments, please inquire with a financial advisor and consider index funds. ***Never utilize financial instruments you do not understand or have very little experience with, and if anything, use Buffett's rule.*** I consider Taleb to be also a good guide, but I realize most people don't know who he is. ***I humbly suggest you to only utilize investment methods you can reasonably understand, as I have already known individuals who have lost considerable wealth on the basis of financial instruments.***

Thank you for taking the time to read through this long post, and I hope you ~~clovtards~~ ~~cloverites degenerates~~ educated healthcare sector investors have learned something from my musings.

Sincerely

Some of you have been DMing about my thought regarding the recent price movement of Clover healthcare, Humana, and Aetna (CVS). Therefore, I am making this post. This is also to supplement what Moocao's said in his recent post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1fur4pv/did\_clover\_health\_obtain\_4\_star\_rating\_we\_do\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1fur4pv/did_clover_health_obtain_4_star_rating_we_do_not/)

Recently, while browsing [Medicare.gov](http://Medicare.gov), we were able to sort Medicare Advantage Plans by their star ratings. Based on this, it appears that Clover Health (CLOV) is now listed among companies offering a plan with a 4-star or higher rating. Some news outlets are speculating that this is a glitch in the system, while others are treating it as confirmation of a rating upgrade.

I want to emphasize that **we do not engage in speculation on this Reddit**. We should be receiving the official announcement for the star ratings next week. What likely happened today is that CMS inadvertently wrote and uploaded the SQL code for the healthcare plan star ratings ahead of the scheduled release. This is why we're seeing what seems to be a leak or early preview of the 2025 star ratings.

Based on the information available, it appears that Clover Healthcare’s rating has been upgraded to 4.0 stars, which explains why the stock surged by 29% today. However, remember, this is not official yet. Our stance, which aligns with that of institutional investors, is that the information isn’t confirmed until CMS or Clover Health formally announces it. Therefore, we’ll refrain from making any detailed posts or analyses until the official news is released next week.

At that time, Moocao will conduct a thorough due diligence (DD) on the impact this might have on margins and other financial aspects once the ""true"" star rating is revealed. Typically, CMS double- and triple-checks their data before making updates to their SQL code, so we're reasonably confident that this leak reflects what will be officially released. Nevertheless, we still need to wait for official confirmation.

That said, assuming this 4-star rating holds, here’s what we observed today: (1) there was some short covering, and (2) both retail shorts and hedge funds began to react by covering positions. We anticipate that institutional investors will follow suit next week once the official rating is confirmed. It seems like the Clover brigade was caught off guard like back in March, causing them to abandon their positions at the $2.50 and $3.00 strike prices, and now they're focusing on defending $3.50. So expect some shorting tomorrow and Friday.

One final interesting note: if you filter Medicare Advantage plans by 4-star ratings in New Jersey, you’ll see that Clover Health and Aetna are the only providers offering plans at that level. Considering Aetna’s current situation, it looks like Clover Health could be poised to dominate the New Jersey market.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1ftpqsr/cvs\_health\_mulling\_options\_including\_possible/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1ftpqsr/cvs_health_mulling_options_including_possible/)

On a separate note, I want to stress the importance of thoroughly reading 10-K and 10-Q filings. These documents provide critical insights, and many of the developments you're seeing in the healthcare sector today were already hinted at in earlier 10-Q filings. In other words, if you're waiting for breaking news or today’s headlines to make investment decisions, you're already behind the curve.

The information provided in SEC filings is designed to give investors a comprehensive view of a company's financial health, strategy, and potential risks. Companies often communicate important trends, challenges, and opportunities that can help you anticipate what may happen in the market. By the time this information reaches the news, much of the impact may have already been priced into the stock.

With that in mind, I urge everyone to take the time to read and understand these filings. Familiarizing yourself with the details in the 10-K and 10-Q reports allows you to stay ahead of the game and make informed decisions, rather than relying on the delayed interpretation of events by the media. Remember, understanding the financial and operational data within these filings is key to interpreting where the company—and the broader industry—may be headed.

We knew Humana was going to eat shit 2 months ago. We didn't need to wait until today to know this fact. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/humana-says-members-highly-rated-112019987.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/humana-says-members-highly-rated-112019987.html)

What you witnessed today with Clover Health (CLOV) was something we anticipated—it was just a matter of *when*. Remember when I mentioned earlier this year that we would see Software as a Service (SaaS) contracts this year, and some people were skeptical? Well, we’re seeing a similar situation unfold now.

If the CMS early release is accurate, Clover Health is positioned to dominate the New Jersey market. Why? Because Aetna, one of their main competitors in the region, is currently facing significant challenges and isn’t performing as well. This puts Clover in a very strong position for growth.

What does this mean for Clover Health in 2025? We’ll have to wait for more information before we can draw any firm conclusions. Right now, I’m gathering additional details, and as always, we will ensure that we base any discussion on verified facts. After all, we have high standards on this subreddit, and we don't jump to conclusions without thoroughly vetting the data."

This is pretty huge news.  Humana has said that their main plan which accounts for 45% of their MA membership has dropped from 4.5 stars to 3.5 stars.  This is a huge opportunity for Clover if they were able to at least maintain their 3.5 rating.  The article also mentions star ratings are expected to be released on or around Oct 10."

The first 4 segments will focus on the top 4 EHR within the market (although one can make the argument Allscripts shouldn't be in that top 4 designation). What this post aims to do is to list the pricing structure of the EHR market and to familiarize ourselves with the market participants. The purpose, of course, is to sort of gauge what Counterpart Health should be doing for the short-term foreseeable future. The caveats: not all the contracts are public information, and current contracts may be different than past figures. In addition, depending on the modules purchased for each software enterprises, the pricing can be different as well. This also does not take into account training costs, implementation cost overruns, server/client side IT requirements, etc. ***In essence, what I am giving you guys are extremely soft ballpark figures***, because official figures are pretty much not public information. With preambles out of the way, let us proceed:

**Preambles:**

[**Maryland HSCRC:**](https://hscrc.maryland.gov/Pages/About-Us.aspx) Hospital rate regulation in Maryland was established by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1971. The law created the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC), an independent State agency with seven Commissioners appointed by the Governor.

The HSCRC was given broad responsibility regarding the public disclosure of hospital data and operating performance and was authorized to establish hospital rates to promote cost containment, access to care, equity, financial stability and hospital accountability. Since that time, all payers pay Maryland hospitals on the basis of the rates established by the HSCRC. The goals of the Commission are:

* Constrain hospital cost growth
* Ensure that hospitals have the financial ability to provide efficient, high-quality services to all Marylanders
* Increase the equity or fairness of hospital financing

*Maryland HSCRC also compiles all Maryland hospital's financial statements, including IRS-990 forms. We can use this to trace certain important events to these hospital's financial health. For this post's purposes, we only care about how much they paid EPIC.*

[**IRS form 990:**](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-990)

Tax-exempt organizations, nonexempt charitable trusts, and section 527 political organizations file Form 990 to provide the IRS with the information required by section 6033.

**Why did Moocao not use the first google search results?**

These EHR contracts are opaque for a reason. ***Some random blogger can lie 5 ways through Sunday on the internet, but you can't lie to the IRS - unless you want to sniff a jail cell***.

Duke University Health System will shell out $700 million, so will Boston-based Partners HealthCare; University of California, San Francisco will pay $150 million. Customers, such as New Hampshire’s Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center are feeling the pinch. DHMC which implemented Epic last year at a cost of $80 million, expects a weak operating performance in 2012, partly because of expenses related to Epic.

[**UMMC (2015)**:](https://hscrc.maryland.gov/Documents/public-interest/irs-990-2015/UMMS.pdf) The [University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland_Medical_Center)is a teaching hospital with 806 beds based in Baltimore, Maryland, that provides the full range of health care to people throughout Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic region. It gets more than 26,000 inpatient admissions and 284,000 outpatient visits each year.

[**The Johns Hopkins Hospital (2016)**](https://hscrc.maryland.gov/Documents/public-interest/irs-990-2016/JHH-TxYEJune17-IRS990.PDF): The [Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Johns Hopkins Hospital is widely regarded as one of the world's greatest hospitals and medical institutions. [The Johns Hopkins Hospital is a 1,000-bed academic Level 1 trauma and comprehensive stroke center in Baltimore](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/emergency-medicine/em-residency/hospitals#:~:text=The%20Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital%20is,for%20the%20last%20two%20decades) that has been placed at or near the top of U.S. hospital rankings annually for the last two decades. 

[Fitch](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-rates-johns-hopkins-health-system-md-series-2016-revs-aa-24-10-2016): CONTINUED CAPITAL SPENDING: JHHS completed significant building projects with a cost of well over $1 billion over the last four years and successfully completed the implementation of its EPIC electronic medical record throughout its entire system in July 2016.

*Don't forget to add the ""the"" in front of Johns Hopkins Hospital. Don't be that out of state person, OK? Kind of like ""The Ohio State"", but The Hop actually has a real reputation. For Ohio state fans, don't forget to press the dislike button. You're welcome.*

I think these IRS Form 990 numbers are yearly subscription costs. Implementation costs are humongous - that is what I have heard through the grapevines. I will work on Johns Hopkins Hospital's ***ESTIMATED*** implementation cost. The information is very much an estimate, as it requires back reviewing HSCRC data AND Fitch's bond recommendations to determine WHEN EPIC implementation for JHH occurred, and then tracking the capitalized software cost throughout that time. That being said, I will define the ***probability*** of the EPIC implementation payment time period to be between 2015-2017.

**Estimated implementation cost from Johns Hopkins Hospital via Maryland HSCRC:**

[JHH 2014 capitalized software cost](https://hscrc.maryland.gov/documents/Hospitals/ReportsFinancial/Audited/fy-2014/0009_JHH_AFS_FY14.pdf): (Before EPIC):

[JHH 2015 capitalized software cost:](https://hscrc.maryland.gov/documents/Hospitals/ReportsFinancial/Audited/fy-2015/JH_ALL_HealthSystem-FS-2015-FINAL.pdf) (possibly including EPIC)

[JHH 2018 capitalized software cost: ](https://hscrc.maryland.gov/Documents/Hospitals/ReportsFinancial/Audited/fy-2018/JHHS-AFS-FY2018.pdf)Finally the cost is below $150 million

If we are to do a payment plan of over 3 years, then if you look at the delta costs between 2015-2017 vs 2014, then the total delta \~ $300 million dollars, JHH 2018 shows that the capital cost finally lowered, which to me tells me a fixed cost has been ""paid off"".

**Fitch's data:** Fitch's bond data is used to corroborate the above information:

2015: [Fitch Rates Johns Hopkins Health System's and Johns Hopkins Corporations' (MD) Revs 'AA-' (fitchratings.com)](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-rates-johns-hopkins-health-system-johns-hopkins-corporations-md-revs-aa-10-04-2015)

MANAGEABLE CAPITAL NEEDS: JHHS recently completed significant building projects that cost well over $1 billion at its main campus and at the Bayview Medical Center. The near future capital spending will focus on Sibley Memorial Hospital replacement facility and proton beam cancer center and investment in their EPIC information technology.

CONTINUED CAPITAL SPENDING: JHHS completed significant building projects with a cost of well over $1 billion over the last four years and successfully completed the implementation of its EPIC electronic medical record throughout its entire system in July 2016. 

2017: [Fitch Affirms Johns Hopkins University, MD's Short-Term Rating at 'F1+' (fitchratings.com)](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-affirms-johns-hopkins-university-md-short-term-rating-at-f1-06-12-2017)

*No mention of EPIC anymore in 2017***.** 

Fitch mentioned in 2015 and 2016 how JHH was upgrading its software as part of capital expenditure, and Fitch was rating JHH bonds during this period and mentioned it. In 2017, this wasn't mentioned. What I can tell is that by 2017 JHH should have sufficient liquidity to pay off any remaining EPIC implementation obligations. $300 million does sound reasonable, although lower than what Duke paid for.

***This is my interpretation of the financial data and does not constitute has hard facts of the matter. Johns Hopkins Hospital is a private enterprise that reports data to the Maryland HSCRC, which I am deriving the balance sheet to come up with a semblance of a clue on how much they paid for in implementation costs. This number may be an over or under-estimate, as the data does not clearly spell out epic's cost.***

[Johns Hopkins Medicine (2012)](https://finance.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/AnnualReport2012.pdf)

[Yes, that is $90 million dollars. Jaw dropping for a medical school. ](https://preview.redd.it/ya0tm3xi6npd1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=57669a6b5bc3e898e2d6b0cedd62d3adf3aeeee0)

**Conclusion:**

As you can see, EPIC implementation cost is quite high, and subscription cost is upwards of 10 million dollars per year for big hospital systems. Therefore, ***to claim that somehow Clover MUST give out Counterpart for free is absolutely ludicrous.*** I will go through Cerner, Meditech, and Allscripts/Altera next for parts 2, 3, and 4. Please wait for those as it will take awhile. 

For this segment I utilized Maryland's HSCRC to independently confirm via IRS form 990 on the cost of EPIC's subscription fee of 2 large hospital systems and an estimate of EPIC's implementation fee of a single large hospital system. I may or may not be as lucky on the other vendors. 

  
Thank you for taking the time to read through this. I hope this provides you with a better perspective of development of the electronic health records space for Counterpart.

"Pump and Dump are now Legal. Clover Brigades are immune from the SEC Right? No, Are you stupid?  ",Healthcare_Anon,1fjkhk7,2024-09-18 00:29:30,29,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1fjkhk7/pump_and_dump_are_now_legal_clover_brigades_are/,Rainyfriedtofu,Due Diligence,"**Hello Fellow Apes,**

I’m excited to bring you an important update today, and it comes with a video I think you’ll find very interesting. Recently, I shared a post about the ongoing manipulation of Clover Healthcare’s stock, and a fellow Ape, Hoanazrag (Hoa), raised a key point. Hoa mentioned that “it’s extremely challenging for the SEC to successfully prosecute pump-and-dump schemes involving retail traders,” citing the fact that several similar cases have recently been dismissed.

https://preview.redd.it/gpm1uoawnhpd1.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfa81f493714c8f052e61d9b8630ff259b7637b8

This got me thinking: Is this how the Clover brigades are trying to reassure their followers—that they won’t face legal consequences for their actions? It seems like they might be trying to create the impression that they’re safe from prosecution, which is dangerous thinking.

But here’s the kicker: a high-profile case that was recently dismissed is actually under appeal by U.S. prosecutors. The reason? The dismissal was deemed “absurd,” and if the ruling is upheld, it could essentially make modern-day pump-and-dump schemes *legal* under certain interpretations (yes, you read that right!). So, for those who think they can manipulate the markets without consequences, think again—this fight is far from over.

Check out the video below, where a prominent figure in the finance world breaks down what this all means and why it’s crucial that we stay informed and vigilant. It's dry humor, but it is a great video explaining why the case was poorly ruled. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqWHiMBBNGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqWHiMBBNGM)

I highly recommend checking out the post I’m referring to—especially the discussion between Hao and Moocao. What I find particularly fascinating is Hao’s strong focus on blaming market manipulation of Clover Healthcare on the market makers (MM). Yet, despite his persistence, he has been unable to provide a clear explanation for the recurring *daily* ""death cross"" pattern that shows up between 10:20 and 10:30 AM every day for over a year on Clover’s ticker.

At *Healthcare\_Anon*, we’re always open to different perspectives and are happy to engage in constructive conversations, but we can’t just take someone's word on such claims without evidence. Relying on a “trust me, bro” attitude doesn’t cut it here. The fact that a stock repeatedly forms a death cross at the same 10-minute window every single day is highly unusual. The only plausible explanation for this pattern is some form of market manipulation. It’s critical that we remain focused on the data and facts, not just speculation.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1fhvlqr/clover\_healthcare\_manipulation\_recap\_992024/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1fhvlqr/clover_healthcare_manipulation_recap_992024/)

I’m going to assume by now most of you have watched the video, so I want to clarify a few important details. The case United States v. Edward Constantinescu et al. (Court Docket No.: 4:22-CR-612) has not been dismissed. In fact, several motions to dismiss were denied by the court. The defendants argued that the government was misapplying securities laws, particularly in relation to their intent to defraud and alleged conspiracy to commit fraud. However, the court rejected these arguments, stating that the charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to defraud, as outlined in 18 U.S.C. §§ 1348 and 1349, are legitimate and must be addressed through a trial.

Currently, the case is under appeal to a higher court. There has been some confusion around a supposed “dismissal,” but this was based on a misunderstanding of the case’s progress. The judge in question, Bob Casey, is 78 years old and, according to some, may not fully grasp the complexities of modern-day pump-and-dump schemes. If his decision stands, it could potentially create a loophole, essentially legalizing certain forms of stock manipulation. This would be a dangerous precedent, allowing bad actors to manipulate markets without consequence.

As Moocao, Upsetweekend, and I have discussed in previous posts, the SEC currently lacks the proper tools to fully prosecute these modern manipulative schemes. Their reporting mechanisms are outdated and don’t even have clear options for filing reports on these types of fraud. At Healthcare\_Anon, we’ve had to come up with creative methods to file reports with the SEC to expose these manipulations. Despite the current challenges, I believe that these individuals will eventually face justice once the higher courts—equipped with a better understanding of contemporary fraud techniques—review the case. These schemes are akin to modern-day Ponzi schemes, and it’s only a matter of time before the law catches up.

What Hoa and others are suggesting—that the SEC won’t be able to prosecute these cases—is a tactic likely being used by the brigades to reassure their followers. While it’s true that the SEC faces difficulties at present, I firmly believe our government will eventually develop the necessary tools to hold these manipulators accountable. We are laying the groundwork, creating a public record, and drawing attention to these issues.

A quick history lesson: the concept of the Ponzi scheme gained mainstream attention in the 1920s after Charles Ponzi’s notorious scam collapsed, causing massive financial losses. Following this and other fraudulent schemes, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created in 1934, in response to the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression, to protect investors and oversee the markets. Over time, the SEC has become more effective in prosecuting Ponzi schemes, especially after Bernie Madoff’s infamous $65 billion fraud was uncovered in 2008.

To strengthen its enforcement efforts, the SEC launched a whistleblower program in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This program allows individuals to report fraud and receive rewards for exposing misconduct. It has been a critical tool for uncovering financial crimes and protecting the market.

So, while it may take some time before the authorities can drag these manipulators to court, the wheels of justice are turning. The Clover brigades might be telling themselves that they’re untouchable, but we know better. The documentation, charts, and analysis we’ve been providing aren’t “just conspiracy theories”—they’re a crucial part of building a case and ensuring that justice is eventually served. The dismissal of a case in a lower court doesn’t mean it’s the law of the land, and no, pump-and-dump schemes aren’t legal now, no matter what some may want to believe.

I'm sure the 6919 people online for r/clov reddit for a few minutes that one time and all of the documentation with charts that we're providing is just conspiracy theory (sarcasm).

No, pump and dumps are not legal now. are you stupid? 

By the way, I just want to give a shout-out to the brigade members who are actively engaging with our content. We see your comments and attempts at spamming, but I want to remind you that our automod is doing an excellent job filtering everything out. Your efforts to spread misinformation or push your narrative aren’t going to find a home here. We won’t allow you to control the conversation or distort the facts.

On another note, I have to say, the intensity of your responses—the way some of you read my posts just seconds after I publish them—and the ongoing harassment of my team truly highlight that we’re hitting a nerve. It's quite satisfying to know that our work is making an impact. Your visceral reactions and efforts to disrupt our conversations only reinforce that you’re feeling the pressure. It’s clear that you’re scrambling, especially with the stock situation. We know the stakes for you are high, and it’s obvious that you’re desperate to bring the stock below $3.

In the end, your actions are confirmation that we’re on the right track. So keep trying if you must, but rest assured, we’re not backing down.

I saw your reaction after I made this post today.

The reaction was visceral but as expected. You can't force that death cross to last forever, can you? The reality is you're fighting a losing battle, swimming against the tide, because you’ve lost control of investor sentiment. You no longer have the influence you once did.

We’ve spent months building credibility with the community, educating the public about how both the healthcare sector and investment strategies really work. Meanwhile, all you have are mediocre ""due diligence"" reports (DDs) that read like they were put together by amateurs on WallStreetBets. It's clear you have no true understanding of how healthcare functions or what drives long-term success in this space. You keep relying on shallow metrics like member enrollment, as if that’s the sole factor in determining value.

If I could offer some advice, I’d suggest you take the time to read and learn from *Moocao’s* DDs. We’ve carefully broken down what the key performance indicators in healthcare should be for this year, and we’re constantly updating our readers because healthcare is a dynamic field. As fall approaches, those benchmarks will shift again, and we’ll be here to guide people through it.

"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)",CanadianStockExchange,1ffw9kp,2024-09-13 10:34:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianStockExchange/comments/1ffw9kp/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,Professional_Disk131,Analysis,"In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

Clover Health is still being shorted but we're decoupling from the meme stocks,Healthcare_Anon,1feo7z7,2024-09-11 19:21:36,37,0.97,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1feo7z7/clover_health_is_still_being_shorted_but_were/,Rainyfriedtofu,Due Diligence,"Hello Fellow Apes,

I’m keeping this post brief for now, but I plan to write a more in-depth update on Friday once the dust settles. That said, I wanted to draw attention to an important shift—our stock has officially decoupled from the broader meme stock group. However, despite this decoupling, we’re still facing heavy shorting activity.

I have a few thoughts on why this might be happening, but generally speaking, the Clover Brigades seem to have exhausted their resources and followers. Their ability to manipulate the stock like they did in the past has significantly diminished. You can see evidence of this in several key areas:

* Moving average charts: The momentum isn’t what it used to be.
* r/CLOV activity: There’s a noticeable decline in the number of active members and posts.
* Twitter and Stocktwits engagement: The level of activity on these platforms has dropped off.
* Absence of a death cross: Interestingly, despite their efforts, they haven’t been able to trigger a single death cross today (9/11/2024).

It’s almost amusing—despite their attempts, they couldn’t manage even one death cross. That makes me wonder: will this post provoke them to double down tomorrow, throwing more money into the game to trigger those death crosses they’ve been chasing? After all, their target price remains fixed at $2.50.

For now, I’ll leave you with a chart that illustrates the decoupling and a link to a post that we’ll revisit over the weekend. Keep an eye out for my longer update this Friday!

**Again, between 10:20 and 10:30,** we saw the algorithm attempt to short the stock to trigger a death cross. When that didn’t happen, they responded by dumping a significant amount of money into the stock, which led to the noticeable **71.5k volume red spike.** This almost succeeded in triggering the death cross—but it fell short.

For the rest of the day, the stock would have likely moved higher, but the overall market conditions—particularly the actions of **Nasdaq** and **ALHC**—went bbbrrrrrrrr...... As a result, the best they could manage was to bring the price down to **$2.65**."

While I am researching on how structure my DD for the Clover EHR pricing segment, I noticed something that caught my eye.

While I would usually leave this to Rainy for further ""spanking"", I noticed that ***it was I who did the Hindenburg debunking just 23 days ago.*** It is therefore my responsibility (to my discontent) on addressing another house's issues ***yet again***. It seems that my first several DDs on this subreddit still hasn't had the intended effect, and the crackhouse over there is still open and receiving customers. I have noticed the quality of the ""product"" has slowly degraded to barely consumable talc powder + horse tranqualizers, and the recent stock price hasn't ""juiced up"" the quality either. First, our disclaimers:

**How does one even get this article?**

Good question. Here are my google search screens:

[Let's try Hindenburg Clover Yahoo... all 2021 articles](https://preview.redd.it/uveiougxz1od1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f8cc05d3707eccc46814e5edf9e5bd286f4026f)

[He said something about front page of Yahoo FInance. What about Yahoo finance home page? Nope! ](https://preview.redd.it/d10uhgh502od1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fd98063438a131fdbf2975cf496c621c0f90e67)

So how does one get to that page? Well, let's try backtracking from the yahoo article:

https://preview.redd.it/u6nqtusr02od1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=7557d9a4e6905db08e2ab85043aec29c032f37da

So this is a Hindenburg research DD on SMCI via Motley Fool, reposted onto Yahoo. You have to dig through the article to find the Clover part. ***David forgot Adani (2023)!*** *Adani is actually a $205B company, not anywhere near risky prior to Hindenburg reports, and Hindenburg is now fighting India's SEC. Adani also has a big lawyer team, and they are not happy. Here let me help him out:*

Please do not bother this poor man. He probably doesn't know his response piece will live in OpenAI forever. If India's SEC successfully goes after Hindenburg, then everything else falls apart too, right?

**Let us get back to the reason why I decided to highlight this:**

I took the long way to show how hit pieces are generated: the piece goes through an email inbox, which in this case I assume it to be either Motley Fool or Yahoo, and someone had to decide to open it, read it, then post it. ***Half the time I never even look at my spam email inbox, this individual took the time to do it.*** CONGRATULATIONS MAN!!! The title was kind of cute too. ***It's not FUD I swear!!!*** ***I just had to dig through my email inbox, eye scan it, take 5 minutes to post it, don't give context, and let the internet do my dirty work! Didn't you read the front page of Yahoo Finance news to find this too?***

**Moocao's response to Hindenburg:**

[Hindenburg Research and Clover Health: a retrospective review of the 2021 short seller report and a reconciliation of the report : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1evrjs1/hindenburg_research_and_clover_health_a/)

Go ahead and just read the piece. I am too lazy to copy paste each little subsection, and it's annoying. I've done most of the work already, but I guess I have to drag out Hindenburg's body and flog it every month.

**Why are we r / Pyoungyang?**

So that you don't need to be flooded with useless posts/comments/trolls/etc. The whole purpose of a moderation team ***is to moderate the board***. Each Subreddit has its own internal policies, depending on the Mod's personal touches, inclinations, and background. ***Ours mods tend to be extremely evidence based, background based, and factual support based.*** Read our policies, we take our Mod duties seriously. ***We have been previously flooded with trolls and nasty posts in the past, and we have modified our automod to suit the needs of this subreddit.***

This is why you can see our DDs, and our board doesn't have troll posts that hide things. We have given very little leeway in who can freely post on this subreddit for a reason: we need our intended readers and participants to prove their intent and writing abilities before we allow for them the freedom to use our subreddit board. We also know the potential for future SEC review, and therefore in the interest of subreddit litigation risk mitigation, we are extremely selective on whose post gets posted, and whether there is anything we think that is risky. We have a Midwest attitude: our reputation matters.

Personally, I don't care what happens to another person's house, they can burn it down for all I care. I do care about our readers, however, and it is our responsibility in ensuring that if you visit our subreddit, you can have useful information. I also care about the health of our readership, and I know what happened for the past 3 years have been long and arduous.

We as mods have been bombarded with interesting DMs, comments under automod removal, mod mails, Redditcare referrals, and other shenanigans, and we have seen the gutters of social media. I hope our blog/subreddit gives you all something to appreciate.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this long post, and I hope you ~~clovtards~~ ~~cloverites degenerates~~ educated healthcare sector traders/investors have learned something from my musings.

We will leave the AI segment for another day – by the time I am on page 5 I noticed the post is already massively huge, First, our disclaimers:

[**Definitions from HealthIT.gov**](https://www.healthit.gov/faq/what-are-differences-between-electronic-medical-records-electronic-health-records-and-personal)**:**

**Electronic Medical Records (EMR)**: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are ***digital versions of the paper charts*** in clinician offices, clinics, and hospitals. EMRs contain notes and information collected by and for the clinicians in that office, clinic, or hospital and are mostly used by providers for diagnosis and treatment.

**Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: Electronic health records (EHRs) are built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and are inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care. EHRs contain information from ***all the clinicians involved in a patient’s care*** and all authorized clinicians involved in a patient’s care can access the information to provide care to that patient. EHRs also share information with other health care providers, such as laboratories and specialists. EHRs follow patients – to the specialist, the hospital, the nursing home, or even across the country.

**Personal Health Records (PHR)**: Personal health records (PHRs) contain the same types of information as EHRs—diagnoses, medications, immunizations, family medical histories, and provider contact information—but are designed to be set up, accessed, and ***managed by patients***. 

[**Artifical Intelligence (AI)**](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/jsr-17-task-002_aiforhealthandhealthcare12122017.pdf): Artificial Intelligence (AI), where computers perform tasks that are usually assumed to require human intelligence, is currently being discussed in nearly every domain of science and engineering.

**We can therefore conclude: Iowa Clinic's Patient Health Record is accessible via FollowMyHealth, and the EHR is Allscripts/Veradigm.**

[**The Iowa Clinic's history with Allscripts**](https://investor.veradigm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/iowa-clinic-implement-allscripts-electronic-health-record)**:**

April 21, 2006: Allscripts (Nasdaq:MDRX), the leading provider of clinical software, connectivity and information solutions that physicians use to improve healthcare, announced today that The Iowa Clinic, P.C. has selected the TouchWorks(TM) Electronic Health Record to provide electronic connectivity to the 119-physician multi-specialty group.

The Iowa Clinic will integrate TouchWorks with its existing IDX(R) Groupcast(TM) practice management solution from IDX Systems Corporation. Allscripts and IDX, now a part of GE Healthcare, share a strategic relationship that will directly link clinical and financial information to support operational improvements at The Clinic.

March 02, 2022 05:00 PM Eastern Standard Time: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (NASDAQ: MDRX) (“Allscripts”) announced today that it has reached an agreement with Constellation Software Inc. (TSX:CSU), through its wholly-owned subsidiary N. Harris Computer Corporation (“Harris”), to sell Harris the net assets of Allscripts Hospitals and Large Physician Practices business segment. The Hospitals and Large Physician Practices business segment includes the Sunrise™, Paragon®, **Allscripts TouchWorks®, Allscripts®** Opal, STAR™, HealthQuest™ and dbMotion™ solutions. The assets of Allscripts Veradigm business segment are not included in this transaction and will continue to be owned by Allscripts going forward.

*As you can see, Allscripts Touchworks and Allscripts are sold to Constellation Software. This means Veradigm isn't actually the company that has ownership of The Iowa Clinic's software enterprise. This also means that The Iowa Clinic may have had a choice presented to them in 2023: renew with Allscripts/Altera, or find another EHR vendor.*

**Conjecture: Why didn't Iowa Clinic renew the contract with Allscripts -** [**The Mercy Hospital story**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/iowa-hospital-blames-ehr-install-for-bankruptcy.html)

December 26th, 2023\*\*:\*\* Iowa hospital blames EHR install for bankruptcy

The hospital contracted with Altera Digital Health for its EHR platform in 2021, but Mark Toney, Mercy's chief restructuring officer, said in his court declaration that the system caused ""significant operational problems"" such as coding and patient collection issues. He also mentioned the EHR made it challenging to submit regulatory reports on deadline and ""misconfigured workflows,"" according to the report.

***What is Altera?***

N. Harris Computer Corporation (“Harris”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation Software Inc. (TSX:CSU), announced that it has completed the purchase of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions’ Hospitals and Large Physician Practices business segment. The segment will now operate as [Altera Digital Health](https://www.alterahealth.com/), a business unit of Harris Healthcare.

**Who did Mercy Hospital initially signed the EHR contract with?**

[So it was Allscripts first!](https://preview.redd.it/qg21ymfu6ind1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=df481bcb214f2881be5f8cf31b10c8fab4e3f5fd)

As you can see, Mercy Iowa initially contracted with Allscripts. Allscripts then was sold to Harris and became Altera. This is where Mercy Iowa’s nightmare first started.

[**Why did Mercy Iowa Hospital became bankrupt:**](https://www.thegazette.com/health-care-medicine/mercy-medical-record-transition-heats-up-in-bankruptcy-court/)

Dec. 22, 2023: Mercy medical record transition heats up in bankruptcy court

In previous bankruptcy documents, Mercy has listed Altera Digital Health among potential “causes of action” for its “implementation of EMR system.”

“These included difficulties in coding, billing and collecting for patient encounters, an inability to submit regulatory reports on time and misconfigured workflows,” according to Toney. “Consequently, the flawed system caused a precipitous loss of revenue in late 2022 and early 2023 due to delayed patient bill submissions, resulting in a substantial backlog of accounts receivable payments that could not be collected promptly.”

Mercy’s accounts receivable ballooned by more than 40 percent during that period, “despite lower year-over-year net patient revenues.”

“As a result, (Mercy’s) financial liquidity was severely affected during the latter half of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.”

*Meaning a bad EHR can bankrupt a hospital, so that Allscripts EHR contract became a poison pill. Hey, does this remind you of the 2012 case that Allscripts had to settle?*

**Values in the Midwest:**

“an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay, hard work, modesty, your word is your bond, always lend a helping hand, ***your name and reputation is your most prized possession.***”

*Allscripts/Altera literally trashed their reputation in the Midwest. Iowa Clinic’s choice involves finding a new EHR vendor after this debacle.*

[**Other troubles: Veradigm is delisted from NASDAQ since 2024:**](https://investor.veradigm.com/static-files/2d29686e-81ec-4561-a55b-ab451fd1ef42)

So we went through a lot of information, and I made the conjecture that Iowa Clinic did not renew their contract with Allscripts/Altera based on the information presented. For people who do not understand the meaning of accounts receivables ballooning 40% - it means the EHR wasn’t able to submit billing codes correctly, and Mercy Iowa didn’t get paid ***despite paying a lot of money for a working EHR***. Altera/Allscripts left Mercy Iowa hospital to the mercy of crappy software, and University of Iowa eventually bought [***the entire hospital for $28 million dollars.***](https://www.thegazette.com/higher-education/university-of-iowas-final-bid-for-mercy-hospital-was-28-million/) Literally pennies on the dollar. UI got a great deal out of this, bondholders got shafted.

**End of Conjecture.**

**What brought The Iowa Clinic and Clover health together:** [**Christina Taylor, CMO, Value Based care, Clover Health**](https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/drchristinataylortestimonysenatebudgetcommittee.pdf)

\[Dr. Taylor\] started in a physician owned multi-specialty group, The Iowa Clinic, and \[she\] was their first Chief Quality Officer; \[She became\] then Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at McFarland Clinic, where \[they\] served both urban and rural patients in Iowa. \[She has\] further served as the medical director of a multi-state accountable care organization (ACO) of which The Iowa Clinic and McFarland were both part. In \[her\] career \[she has\] been deeply involved in transitioning \[her\] organizations from Fee-For- Service to Value-Based Care and directing those efforts.

 … To explain, Clover and similar organizations bring timely patient information to the PCPs at the point of care. Much of this relevant patient data is external to what a provider would have in their electronic medical record. Important details include gaps in clinical care, missing diagnoses, recent emergency room or hospitalizations and medications the patient is taking which the provider may not be aware. This type of information is needed to more safely and efficiently care for patients, and I used by the primary care providers when they see patients at office visits.

 **What can Clover Health bring to the table:**

 Ben Vaillier, CEO of The Iowa Clinic: Counterpart’s ability to harness clinical data to drive improved outcomes, combined with its intuitive design that understands the needs of practicing clinicians, stood out among other potential solutions, and makes it a perfect fit for our organization. We are very optimistic about the immediate and long-term clinical and financial value it will bring to our providers and patients alike

 **What is the payment model:**

 Under the terms of the agreement, clinicians serving The Iowa Clinic’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Shared Savings Program patients will use Counterpart Assistant, Counterpart Health’s cutting-edge cloud-based software platform. Additionally, the platform will be made available to The Iowa Clinic’s clinically integrated network partners throughout the Midwest. Counterpart will receive a per-member, per-month fee, as well as potential incentive payments contingent on achieving certain care management goals.

 **END OF PART 1**.

 On the next part, we will discuss Allscripts and its SaaS business model, its user interface and how it differs from Clover, income to revenue ratio in 2006 vs 2022, and Allscript’s EHR growth story. What is important to realize is that we now know Allscripts EHR is currently facing obstacles in adoption, and several key contracts have moved away from Cerner.

When Peter Kuipers was first starting at Omnicell, the dominant players were McKesson and Pyxis. Omnicell ate McKesson’s lunch on the automation section of the healthcare business. We expect a similar story at Clover Health.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this long post, and I hope you ~~clovtards~~ ~~cloverites degenerates~~ educated healthcare sector investors have learned something from my musings.

In the event that you don't like our analysis of the healthcare industry, I would like to share this hot off the press article with you. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-medical-114200751.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-medical-114200751.html)

The thing that stood out to me right away was this paragraph

""Per a Market Research report, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical device market is expected to witness a CAGR of 44.4% during 2024-2028. The market's growth will be propelled by the growing demand for healthcare systems to reduce time and costs and improve detection capabilities, particularly when diagnosing a growing number of patients with complex profiles. As much as 80% of health systems claimed to have plans to increase their investment levels in digital health over the next five years (a HIMSS report).""

CAGR, or **Compound Annual Growth Rate**, is a financial metric used to measure the rate of return on an investment over a specified period, assuming the profits are reinvested each year. In the healthcare sector, CAGR is used to track the growth rate of various aspects, such as revenue growth, market growth, and patients population growth. 

There are several implications to the CAGR increase of 44.4% beyond the share price going up. Investors--especially institutional investors--use CAGR to evaluate the growth potential of healthcare companies or subsectors. A higher CAGR might indicate strong future performance and profitability, making the sector more attractive for investment. Healthcare organizations use CAGR to project future revenue, patient volumes, or market share, allowing for informed decisions on resource allocation, scaling operations, or expanding services. Sectors with a high CAGR (like biotechnology or digital health) often attract more investment in research and development. This leads to faster innovation and the introduction of new treatments, products, or technologies. Governments and regulatory bodies might monitor the CAGR of healthcare costs or certain healthcare markets to make informed policy decisions, especially when managing public health resources. A high CAGR in healthcare spending could imply rising costs for patients and insurers, highlighting areas where efficiency and cost containment are critical. This often triggers discussions around healthcare reform.

All of the above benefits Clover Healthcare, and we're seeing that in our DD of Clov and its peers. With that said, please continue to discount this ticker for us. hahaha

"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)",DueDiligence,1f9mlmp,2024-09-05 09:32:55,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DueDiligence/comments/1f9mlmp/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,MightBeneficial3302,DD,"In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

https://preview.redd.it/cencheujtzmd1.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=f56cea96033d4c8c2d3c37f3ffbcc86fd3d2c11b

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

Clover Health Stock Manipulation 8.29.2024 and Research articles about manipulation,Healthcare_Anon,1f42laa,2024-08-29 09:35:27,37,0.97,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1f42laa/clover_health_stock_manipulation_8292024_and/,Rainyfriedtofu,Due Diligence,"Hello Fellow Apes,

Today, I want to shed light on the stock manipulation happening with Clover Health—something we've seen repeatedly, like clockwork, thanks to the Clover Brigade's algo machine. But I also want to draw attention to those who continue to claim that there's ""nothing to see here."" Despite three years of clear manipulation on platforms like r/CLOV, StockTwits, and Twitter, we still encounter individuals, like the one below, who try to gaslight us into believing everything is fine.

https://preview.redd.it/mmsdt8nxqlld1.png?width=1779&format=png&auto=webp&s=8318d7072f0e4ccf71858dad83cdacadb4b7e051

What frustrates me about these types of people is their relentless pessimism and their constant attempts to convince you that nothing you do matters. They tell you your vote doesn’t count, your words don’t have an impact, and that you’re insignificant. These individuals fail to understand and appreciate the power of collectivism and the immense impact that collective action can have.

What we discuss here—the role of social media in stock manipulation and the actions of the Clover Brigades—is not some baseless conspiracy theory. It’s backed by evidence. We have peer-reviewed journals and publications that confirm these activities are happening right before our eyes, and we are only beginning to uncover the full extent of it. These studies are pioneering work, breaking new ground in understanding how markets are manipulated through these channels.

Social media platforms like Twitter and StockTwits are popular places where investors, traders, and entrepreneurs share their thoughts on the stock market. Previous research has shown that the information shared on these platforms can sometimes be used to predict stock market trends. However, not everyone on these platforms has good intentions. Some people might try to influence others' trading decisions by sharing misleading or false information.

While much of the past research has focused on how social media can be used to predict the stock market, there are still many unanswered questions. For example, which platform—Twitter or StockTwits—is better at predicting stock performance? What kind of posts actually help in predicting stock trends, and how long do these predictions stay relevant? Additionally, do all users provide reliable information, or are some consistently misleading?

To explore these questions, researchers analyzed nearly five years of data (from 2015 to 2019) from Twitter and StockTwits. The study revealed several important findings:

1. **StockTwits is more predictive than Twitter**: Among the two platforms, StockTwits provided more useful information for predicting stock performance, so the researchers focused their analysis on this platform.
2. **User sentiments on StockTwits are somewhat predictive**: The feelings or sentiments that users express about stocks on StockTwits are related to the actual stock market performance, but they are only slightly helpful in predicting short-term trends.
3. **Different users have different prediction behaviors**: Over a 144-day period, users showed three main types of prediction patterns—short-term, medium-term, and long-term.
4. **Consistently wrong users might be bots**: Some users consistently made incorrect predictions. The researchers suspect that these users might be bots—automated accounts designed to mislead others. Removing these unreliable users from the analysis improved the accuracy of stock market predictions.

**Article 2: The evolution of studies on social media sentiment in the stock market: Insights from bibliometric analysis**

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227623000546](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227623000546)

The idea of using social media sentiment in the stock market refers to analyzing how people's opinions and feelings shared on social media platforms influence different aspects of the stock market, such as returns, trading volume, and volatility. With the rise of platforms like Twitter, StockTwits, WeChat, and Sina-Weibo, investors now have easy ways to share their thoughts about the market, making it possible to gather and analyze this sentiment on a large scale.

This study explores how the use of social media sentiment in the stock market has evolved over the past decade. To do this, the researchers used several methods, including analyzing how often different studies are cited together (co-citation), how closely related different research papers are (bibliographic coupling), and how frequently specific terms appear together in research (co-occurrence analysis). These methods helped the researchers get a clear picture of how the concept of social media sentiment is structured within stock market research.

The study found that the idea of social media sentiment in the stock market is multidisciplinary, meaning it spans across various fields of study. Most of the research has been done in computer science and mathematical sciences, with fewer studies coming from economics and finance. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on new ways to extract and analyze sentiment from social media, as shown by the increasing use of terms like “Natural Language Processing,” “Machine Learning,” and “Deep Learning” in research papers. These are advanced techniques used to process and understand large amounts of text data.

In summary, the concept of ""social media sentiment"" in the stock market is expanding into various research areas, including physics, mathematical sciences, computer science, and finance. This study is the first of its kind to use bibliometric analysis (a method of analyzing research literature) to examine how the idea of social media sentiment has developed over time.

**Article 3: Synergy between stock prices and investor sentiment in social media**

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214845022000710](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214845022000710)

The basic idea behind using investor sentiment (how investors feel about the market) to predict stock prices, market returns, and liquidity is that there is a strong connection between stock prices and investor sentiment. In other words, if stock prices go up, people feel more positive, and if they go down, people feel more negative. However, this relationship hasn't been studied much in detail until now.

This paper investigates the connection between stock prices and investor sentiment by analyzing social media messages from investors using natural language processing techniques (advanced methods to understand and process text data). On a large scale (macro level), the researchers found a very strong positive relationship between how investors feel and stock prices. When stock prices rise, investor sentiment also rises, and when prices fall, sentiment drops.

However, this connection isn't always consistent—it can change or even disappear over certain periods. By breaking down the relationship throughout the day, the study also found that investor sentiment on social media tends to be forward-looking, meaning it can anticipate future changes in stock prices. This provides a solid reason to use investor sentiment as a tool for predicting stock prices.

The researchers also looked at how lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the relationship between stock prices and investor sentiment. Using machine learning techniques, they found that external anxiety, such as the stress caused by lockdowns, can significantly influence this connection. Interestingly, this influence can either strengthen or weaken the relationship, leading to either positive or negative outcomes.

In summary, this paper offers new insights into how investor sentiment can be used to predict stock prices, the behavior of investors, and how events like the COVID-19 lockdowns impact the stock market. It highlights the importance of considering both the psychological factors driving the market and the external factors that can alter these dynamics.

These are all recent research articles conducted by academic experts. The evidence is strong and convincing: social media platforms are being used to manipulate the stock market. Despite this, there are still people out there trying to convince us otherwise, attempting to gaslight us into thinking our actions have no value and that we’re just buying into a conspiracy theory. But here’s the irony—they're the ones flooding social media with posts, trying to influence how we feel about certain stocks. Do you see the contradiction? They dismiss our concerns as baseless, yet they’re actively engaging in the very behavior we're discussing.

Here’s the DD (Due Diligence) for Clover Health on 8/29/2024. The U.S. GDP Growth Rate for Q2 is estimated at 3%, beating the forecast of 2.8%. This indicates that America’s economy is strong, and we’re likely to see a rate cut in September. As a result, most of the stock market is expected to rise today.

However, the Clover Brigades have their covered calls set at $3, so the stock will likely be manipulated and shorted in preparation for Friday. They’ll probably aim to drive the price below $3 by the end of the week. I’ll post an updated picture on this post later today to confirm this. I’m writing this post just before the market opens to make a point.

Update 10:36. 

Look at what we have here. A death cross forming at 10:20-10:30 am everyday. I'm sure that is just random trading right? haha Get out of here man. Unlike r/clov we actually moderate our sub. By the way, can you guys guess what happen when they have to buy back all of the shares they shorted including the naked one? Remember kids, their covered call for this week is $3. \^\_\_\_\^

Over-Celebration-168's question regarding manipulation and why the SEC has not done anything yet.,Healthcare_Anon,1f2vwlg,2024-08-27 19:45:03,24,0.94,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1f2vwlg/overcelebration168s_question_regarding/,Rainyfriedtofu,Due Diligence,"Hello Fellow Ape, 

A redditor wanted to make a post, but he couldn't because he didn't have enough Karma to post. Sadly, I don't know how to adjust this sub to allow him post, but he did send me his questions so I decided to make a post about it. Please see below... 

""...your posts brings positivity because, it's good knowing that the dip in the price is not because the company is doing bad, it's the market stock manipulators doing. I want to ask in the trading world where there are regulations why this is stoll going unnoticed. Is it because this not a trillion dollar company that SEC don't want to put too much thought in to this?""

The short answer is that the SEC and academic experts have suspected this type of manipulation since 2021. However, they currently lack the appropriate legal tools and a full understanding of the methods being used to effectively address these issues. To better understand this, we can look at Clov as an example in my old post. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare\_Anon/comments/1e20y19/social\_media\_and\_market\_manipulation\_clover/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1e20y19/social_media_and_market_manipulation_clover/)

However, we can expand on this a little more. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a number of laws and regulations at its disposal to pursue stock manipulators. These laws are primarily designed to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. The current tools that they have at their disposal are:

1. Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934

2. Section 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act

3. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933

4. Regulation M

5. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010

The current problem is the SEC are having challenges in addressing the new generation of market manipulators. Traditional regulations assume that market manipulation is carried out by centralized entities or individuals who can be easily identified and prosecuted. However, new forms of market manipulation, such as those involving decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms or coordinated actions on social media, can involve large, dispersed groups. These groups may not have a clear leader or central organization, making it difficult for the SEC to identify and prosecute perpetrators. Hell, if you ever filed a report with the SEC, you will quickly realize that their forms are not equipped to report this kind of security fraud. 

Platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Discord have allowed large groups of retail investors to coordinate trading actions, sometimes resulting in significant market disruptions. While some of this activity may be entirely legal, determining when it crosses the line into manipulation (e.g., pump-and-dump schemes) is challenging. Social media adds layers of anonymity and can rapidly amplify market movements, making enforcement reactive rather than proactive. They have busted a few discord and threw the book at those guys, but there are so many more out there.

The speed at which information spreads on social media and the pace of trading (especially with algorithmic trading) often outstrips the SEC’s ability to monitor and respond. The SEC’s traditional tools, designed for slower, more deliberate forms of market manipulation, may be less effective against real-time, viral campaigns.

Many new platforms and individuals involved in these activities may be based outside the U.S., beyond the direct jurisdiction of the SEC. This globalized nature of financial markets complicates enforcement and regulation.

Overall, the SEC's existing laws and tools were designed for a different era of financial markets. They are focused on centralized actors and slower-moving, more obvious forms of manipulation. As financial markets evolve with technology, new strategies for coordination and manipulation have emerged, often outpacing the regulatory framework. To effectively combat these new forms of manipulation, there may be a need for updated regulations, enhanced international cooperation, and new tools that can monitor and address the fast-paced, decentralized nature of modern markets. This is why they are heavily dependent on people like us to report market manipulation, and they are offering big rewards.

He did not leave them on bad terms. He is our pipeline to the big players until Clover has validated itself with SaaS deployment. 

“This is a sentinel moment in the company’s history”, said Fergus Hoban, founder of UpStream. “Tom has the deepest expertise in healthcare finance, especially in Medicare administered plans. He will create the structure we need to provide tens of thousands of primary care physicians with the resources and financial model to provide optimal healthcare to seniors.”
 
“I want to thank Tom for his tremendous contributions to Molina over the past two and a half years,” said Joe Zubretsky, president and chief executive officer of Molina. “During his tenure as CFO, Tom played a key role in driving the company’s margin recovery and sustainability. Tom’s leadership was instrumental to Molina’s transformation, and we are pleased that we will continue to benefit from his insights and expertise over the coming months in advance of his retirement. On a personal note, when Tom is officially retired, I will miss his tenacity, wisdom, and good nature.”

##Tapuiretama: The Eighth Fire Spreads to Brazil

###""Tapuiretama"" means ""Land of the Enemy"" in the Tupi Language, but refers to the interior of Brazil, which was inhabited by Jê peoples.

With the military victory over surface Brazil and Chavez' forces comes the need to form a government and administration over the territory. While our communications with the UASR have as yet gone unanswered, Borealis will begin outlining the new Nations Major to be created and the new territory's integration with Borealis. 

Tapuiretama encompasses all territory gained in the war with Chavez, defined as all of former Brazil south of the Amazon River, the north of which is under occupation by the UASR, and not including the regions occupied by Japanese forces. Local indigenous communities have been contacted and their leadership offered status as nations major within Borealis, of the same status as the eight in North America, to handle state and municipal-level government in the absence of Chavez. Federal-level government will be handled by Borealis, the territory of Tapuiretama being integrated with those in North America to expand the broader country of Borealis. As the Apex's delegate for the region, [Tācikwē-sipiy](https://imgur.com/INaWA5F) or the Shout of the Amazon, also known colliqually as ""[The Propagandist](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1exchmm/roleplay_diplomacy_the_propagandist_and_the/)"", will act as Special Administrator. 

The eight nations comprising the Assembly of Tapuiretama are as follows:

- Sateré-Mawé 
- Kayapo 
- Tekohá
- Ukarãngmã
- Potiguara
- Guajajara
- Xakriabá
- Boe

####[GALLERY: Map of Tapuiretama](https://i.imgur.com/K86dGN5.png)

Consequently, The Assembly as it refers to the nations major of Borealis will be expanded to sixteen seats, and the Board will be expanded to nine as it welcomes Tācikwē-sipiy as the Special Administrator to Tapuiretama. 

As our ground forces took heavy losses against Neymar, the total Borealis deployment in Tapuiretama has been sharply reduced. As the need to maintain security in the region is higher than ever before, the lost equipment will be rebuilt and recruitment temporarily increased. The following unit quantities will be built (total of losses in the most recent battle) for expedited delivery in June 2086:

The Borealis military will be employed in a peacekeeping and reconstruction operation, providing security services to the new Nations Major as they work to establish their own security forces and domestic militaries. In the interim, they will reconstruct damaged and destroyed military bases, garrisons, airfields, and ports across the region to be used for security and occupation purposes. 

The NNWP, as a condition for having provided their [Yáhtųedeneyu](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dgz49g/roleplay_y%C3%A1ht%C5%B3edeneyu/) units to assist in the initial military operations, has received exclusive resource rights for Tapuiretama, and will undertake the obligation to reconstruct the damaged Amazon Rainforest using [Tł'įekąę](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dep53p/tech_t%C5%82%C4%AFek%C4%85%C4%99_perfect_reclamation_of_industrial/) land reclamation technology. The NNWP will finance this reconsutruction, expected to take a period of twelve years (completion January 2095) at a cost of about $286.6 Billion, to restore the landscape and ecosystem to its pre-war condition. With Tljekae's rapid regrowth and soil restoration technologies, the forest in 2095 will be largely indistinguishable from its pre-war state. Agricultural areas will be similarly reconstructed by the NNWP though implementing their [homegrown regenerative agriculture practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1e3kccw/tech_threads_of_human_destiny/), in a lend-lease system similar to that employed in the Cree Nation, thereby considerably reducing the overall carbon footprint of agricultural activities in the Amazon and reversing deforestation seen since colonial times.

Reconstruction of cities and urban areas will be delegated to the nations major, with reconstruction loans offered by the Borealis government in amounts up to $300bn per urban area, per 5-year term. This will incentivize the nations to prioritize the economic output of their regions as loan repayments will begin in 2088, though rapid construction technologies offered for use by the [Innu Nation](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1e0f8xw/roleplay_if_red_green_was_a_way_of_life_the_innu/) has reduced the mean expected time of complete reconstruction to seven years, meaning the country will on average be returned to its pre-war state of economic output by 2090. Nations will largely have free reign of reconstruction efforts with little requirements imposed by the Borealis federal government.

A special case is the city of Carioca (Rio de Janeiro), serving as the capital of Tapuiretama akin to Kelowna in Borealis. In contrast to Kelowna, however, Carioca will remain a sovereign part of the Tekohá Nation. Due to the extensive damage to the city incurred from the Neymarite sinkhole opened beneath it, reconstruction efforts will be complex and the federal government will foot the bill. Architecturally, the city will be reconstructed to resemble [itself in the early 20th century](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1erxlvt/rio_de_janeirobrazil_in_the_early_20th_century/), as this style is 'a vibe', as the Special Administrator put it."
Could clover capitalize on this?,CLOV,1eza18r,2024-08-23 07:11:22,27,0.94,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/1eza18r/could_clover_capitalize_on_this/,sshinski,Discussion,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medicare-advantage-could-lead-to-lower-hospital-credit-ratings-sp-215616446.html

Humor me, 
could clovers saas product help to improve this process and create a shift from the negative sentiment that is claimed in this article? Could this help reduce denied claims, preauthorization, or (doubtful) delayed payments? 


Noted from thus article:
""Health systems have for years lamented the low reimbursement rates from traditional Medicare, but Medicare Advantage (MA) — the profitable government-funded plans managed by commercial insurers — has quickly become the new villain.

And it could spell trouble for hospitals' credit ratings, according to S&P Global Ratings.

With MA plans notoriously delaying payments, denying claims, and forcing hospitals to jump through hoops during the preauthorization process, the issue is now coming to a head and could impact hospital credit scores, according to a new analysis by S&P."""
Clover Health New BOD Thomas (Tom) L Tran,Healthcare_Anon,1eyv6bx,2024-08-22 17:31:22,54,0.99,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthcare_Anon/comments/1eyv6bx/clover_health_new_bod_thomas_tom_l_tran/,Rainyfriedtofu,Due Diligence,"Hello Fellow Apes,

  
I'm a bit disappointed with the due diligence I've seen regarding Tom and the implications of him joining Clover Health's Board of Directors. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge the pride I feel—especially as an Asian and Vietnamese American. Tom is from the same generation as my parents, who immigrated to the U.S. after the Vietnam War. He is one of the few Vietnamese Americans who have ""made it"" and significantly contributed to our community. People like Tom paved the way for many immigrants in the '80s and '90s, offering hope and opportunities in low socioeconomic areas where they settled. He was a trailblazer, someone who helped create the opportunities that people like me benefit from today.

Additionally, Tom is part of the influential Vietnamese community in California, where many of us know each other. There's something special about being Asian in America and working together to achieve the American dream for our community.

With that said, credit must be given where it’s due. Andrew did an excellent job recruiting Peter and now Tom. Thomas L. Tran is a legend in the healthcare field.

Tom is an OG financial executive with extensive experience in the healthcare industry. He served as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Molina Healthcare, Inc. from June 2018 to May 2021. During his tenure at Molina, Tran played a crucial role in the company's financial management, contributing significantly to its margin recovery and overall transformation. Prior to joining Molina, he held similar leadership roles at other healthcare companies, including WellCare Health Plans, where he was instrumental in managing finances for a company with $14 billion in revenue.

WellCare Health Plans, Inc. was a prominent provider of managed care services for government-sponsored health care programs, focusing primarily on Medicaid and Medicare. In 2020, WellCare was acquired by Centene Corporation, a major player in the healthcare industry, in a deal valued at approximately $17.3 billion. This acquisition was part of Centene’s strategy to expand its footprint in the Medicare and Medicaid markets, making it one of the largest providers of government-sponsored health care programs in the United States. Tom was at Wellcare from 2011-2017 before going to Molina. In both cases, he brought the companies up to enormous heights and share price. 

Below is Tom's performance at Wellcare Health Plans. I'm sorry that I don't have a better picture, but it is hard to find a good pick of a stock that is not longer trading. The price is still around $349.92.

Now let's look at Molina, where brought the stock up from $72 to $358 during this tenure there.

Tom is highly skilled in his profession, but his expertise alone isn't the only reason Clover Health is eager to bring him onto the Board of Directors (BOD). Clover is planning to expand into the Medicaid market in the near future, and this is the primary reason for Tom's appointment. He possesses deep knowledge of Medicare, Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicaid. His leadership was key to helping Molina Healthcare thrive in California and expand into other states. I’m not sure how Andrew convinced Tom to join a company with a stock price as low as Clover’s, but I suspect it’s related to Clover’s significant growth potential. Tom has already achieved similar success with two companies, and as someone who has met him before, I can vouch for his exceptional character. As a fellow immigrant, I have immense respect for him and all that he has accomplished. I hope you all appreciate this bit of due diligence. I wanted to share this tomorrow, but I have work and won’t be online then.

Me too Mr. Tran.... Me too....

""Having dedicated my career to improving healthcare through better financial and operational strategies, I find Clover Health's mission very compelling. I believe Clover’s innovative use of technology to drive better health outcomes represents the future of Medicare. I am excited to join the Board and help shape this vision, ensuring Clover continues to lead in value-based care,” said Mr. Tran.""

**I repeat:**

**""** ***I believe Clover’s innovative use of technology to drive better health outcomes represents the future of Medicare.*****"" - Mr. Tran**

I couldn't agree more and personally Clov's tech and SaaS moat and opportunity have been my bull thesis for the last 3+ years.

It's awesome to see other professionals and respected healthcare leaders see and agree with the same things that we are saying.

Great addition to the board for Clov."
