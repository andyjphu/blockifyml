Buy GitHub Account,WhatsAppBeta,1i9od0c,2025-01-25 09:42:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsAppBeta/comments/1i9od0c/buy_github_account/,Spiritual-Tip-3859,,"**What Is GitHub?**

[Buy GitHub Account](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-github-account/). GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store their code in repositories, track changes to the code, and collaborate with others. GitHub is built on top of Git, a version control system created by Linus Torvalds (the founder of Linux), which allows multiple people to work on the same project without overriding each other’s work.

**Key features of GitHub include:**

* **Repositories:** A repository (or repo) is a place where all the files of a project are stored. It can be either private or public.
* **Version Control:** [GitHub](https://github.com/) tracks changes to code using Git. This enables developers to revert to previous versions, see a history of changes, and manage branches.
* **Branches:** Branches allow developers to work on different features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase. Once the work is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch (often called “main” or “master”).
* **Pull Requests:** When changes are made in a branch, a pull request is created to propose these changes to be merged into another branch (usually the main codebase). Pull requests allow for code reviews and discussions before merging.
* **Collaboration:** GitHub is widely used for open-source projects, where developers from around the world can contribute to a project by forking repositories and submitting pull requests.
* **Issues:** GitHub provides an issue tracker, where bugs, feature requests, and other tasks can be reported and tracked.
* **Actions:** GitHub Actions is a feature that allows automation of workflows, such as running tests, building code, or deploying applications every time code is pushed.
* **Wiki:** GitHub repositories can have a Wiki, which is useful for documenting the project.

GitHub has become the default platform for many developers and organizations because of its collaboration features, version control, and large community. It also supports integrations with other tools and services, which makes it a central hub for development workflows.

# How GitHub Account works ?

GitHub is a platform used primarily for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store and share code, track changes, and collaborate with other developers on projects. Here’s how a GitHub account works:

**Creating a GitHub Account**

* **Sign up:** You start by creating a free or paid GitHub account onGitHub.com. After signing up, you’ll have access to repositories (repos) where you can store your code.
* **Profile Setup:** You can personalize your profile by adding a bio, profile picture, and links to your portfolio or social media accounts.

**Repositories (Repos)**

* **Creating a Repo:** A repository is like a project folder where your code and related files are stored. You can create a public or private repository. Public repositories are visible to everyone, while private ones are only accessible to people you grant access.
* **Clone and Fork:** You can clone a repository to your local machine to work on it. You can also fork a repository, which creates your own copy of another user’s repository so you can make changes without affecting the original.
* **Commit Change:** After making changes to your code, you commit them to the repository. A commit includes a message describing the changes made.
* **Push Changes:** After committing your changes locally, you push them to GitHub, making them available on the cloud.

**Branching and Merging**

* **Branching:** GitHub allows you to create branches to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main code (usually the \`main\` or \`master\` branch). Each branch is like an independent workspace.
* **Merging:** Once changes in a branch are ready, you can merge the branch back into the main branch. This is done using pull requests (PRs), which let you review and discuss the changes before merging them.

**Collaborating with Others**

* **Pull Requests (PRs):** Pull requests allow other users to suggest changes to your project. You can review, comment, and merge changes from contributors.
* **Issues and Discussions:** You can create issues to track bugs, tasks, or features. GitHub also offers Discussions where collaborators can chat, ask questions, or plan the next steps of the project.
* **Collaborators:** You can add other users as collaborators on your repository, allowing them to make changes, manage issues, and perform other actions.

**GitHub Actions and CI/CD**  
GitHub also supports [GitHub](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-github-account/) Actions, which allows you to automate tasks such as testing, building, and deploying code whenever changes are made to a repository. This is part of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

**GitHub Pages**  
GitHub offers a feature called GitHub [Pages](https://usaitsell.com/) to host static websites directly from your repository. This is useful for personal websites, portfolios, or project documentation.

**Security Features**

* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** GitHub supports 2FA for additional security.
* **Private Repos:** You can restrict access to your code with private repositories.

**GitHub for Version Control**  
GitHub uses Git, a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code over time. Every time you commit and push changes, Git records the version. You can compare versions, roll back to previous ones, or explore the history of changes in your project.

**Integration with Other Tools**  
[GitHub](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-github-account/) integrates with various tools, such as project management tools (Trello, Jira), code editors (VSCode, Sublime), and deployment platforms (Heroku, AWS).

**Summary of Key Features:**

* **Repositories:** Store and manage your code.
* **Branching and Merging:** Manage different versions of your code.
* **Collaborations:** Work with other developers on the same project.
* **GitHub Actions:** Automate tasks like testing and deployment.
* **GitHub Pages:** Host websites from your repository.
* **Security:** Protect your code with authentication and access controls.

By using GitHub, you can efficiently manage your coding projects, collaborate with others, and keep track of every change made to your codebase.

Why is cooperative ownership so OP?,victoria3,1i9lwhg,2025-01-25 07:27:30,0,0.3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1i9lwhg/why_is_cooperative_ownership_so_op/,Jaded_Car8642,Question,"Cooperative ownership has Government Dividends Reinvestment double that of Interventionism (50%) and equal to to that of Laissez-Faire (100%), while allowing you to have almost twice the SOL (literally more if you are a GP), and making farmers and shopkeepers invest 25% more while literally none other get a similar bonus, except Laissez-Faire which gets its to goddamn capitalists. It also gives Foreign Collectivization for good measure.

It may be just the others being really weak as well, but this sh\*t is ridicilous. You can eaisly have double the SOL and a similar GDP at the same year by simply choosing CO over others. I don't want to roleplay as a IRL USSR improving the world, well aware that the most optimal strategy to go with this is to also go socialist for trade union clout.

Playing both PS4 and PS5 at the same time?,PS_Workshop,1i9hrbi,2025-01-25 02:25:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS_Workshop/comments/1i9hrbi/playing_both_ps4_and_ps5_at_the_same_time/,noah99212,,"It’s not uncommon for households to have both a PS4 and PS5, especially when upgrading to the latest console while still enjoying the older one. However, this setup can sometimes lead to conflicts when trying to use both systems at the same time. A question frequently asked by gamers is, *“Why can’t I play games on my PS4 while someone else uses my PS5, even with PS Plus?”*

**▮ The Question: Why do conflicts arise when using two consoles simultaneously?**

The issue lies in how PlayStation accounts, licenses, and PS Plus subscriptions work across devices. Your PlayStation Network (PSN) account is tied to both consoles, and when trying to access certain games, it can create conflicts if both consoles are logged into the same account.

In the example above, the user explains that they are trying to play *Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (BO6)* on their PS4 while their son plays *Rocket League* on their PS5. Unfortunately, they encounter issues where one of them is kicked off with a message about a conflict. This happens despite *Rocket League* not requiring PS Plus, adding to the confusion.

**▮ Answer: What causes this issue and how can you resolve it?**

1. **PSN Account Restrictions:** PlayStation only allows one active primary account per console at a time. If both consoles are logged into the same account and accessing different games or services, this can lead to conflicts, as the system sees it as an attempt to use one account on multiple devices simultaneously. Even if *Rocket League* doesn’t require PS Plus, being logged into the same account might still cause disruptions.
2. **Game-Specific Licensing:** Some games, such as *Rocket League*, may check for ownership or licenses linked to the PSN account being used. If the primary account is in use on one console, the secondary console might not have the proper permissions to access the game, even if it’s free to play.
3. **Network-Based Authentication:** Online multiplayer games often communicate with servers to authenticate access. If one account tries to access two different servers at the same time (e.g., *BO6* on the PS4 and *Rocket League* on the PS5), the server might register this as an error and disconnect one of the devices.

**▮ How to Fix the Problem:**

* **Set One Console as Primary:** Designate the PS4 as your primary console. This allows other users, like your son, to access your game licenses and PS Plus benefits without needing to log in to your account. On the PS5, log in with a secondary account for *Rocket League*.
* **Create Separate PSN Accounts:** If your son doesn’t already have his own PSN account, set one up for him. Free-to-play games like *Rocket League* don’t require PS Plus, so he can play on his account while you use your PSN profile on the PS4.
* **Game-Specific Solutions:** Some issues might be tied to specific games, like *Rocket League*. Contact Epic Games Support if the problem persists to ensure there are no account-specific restrictions or known bugs.
* **Check Network Configuration:** Ensure your network setup supports multiple devices. Use separate Wi-Fi frequencies (e.g., 2.4GHz for one console and 5GHz for the other) or Ethernet connections to reduce any network-related interference.

**▮ Conclusion:**  
  
While the PS4 and PS5 can technically be used at the same time, conflicts arise when one PSN account tries to manage both systems. By designating primary consoles, creating separate accounts, or optimizing network settings, you can enjoy a smoother gaming experience without interruptions."
Network Connection Issues on Video Games,ITSupport,1i9ejrt,2025-01-24 22:59:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITSupport/comments/1i9ejrt/network_connection_issues_on_video_games/,MoldyVortex16,Open ,"Been encountering some connection issues lately and would like some help or be directed to a better place to post this.  My roommate got a new router for our WiFi (TV couldn't connect) and I also bought a new PCIe WiFi adapter for my computer (better speeds). WiFi has been fine, great speeds and online gaming has been totally fine, regardless of connection load. I could stream movies or play Call of Duty while my roommate watches YouTube on the TV.  
  
However recently my roommate and I both tried to play Black Ops 6 together and I was experiencing the worst packet-loss I've ever seen, the game was completely unplayable but he was having no issues whatsoever. I left the private match and went to a regular multiplayer game without him and had the same issues. The weird part is we were able to play another online game, together, with no issues at all. Not sure if this is a Call of Duty issue (it is known for badly optimized servers) or if this is an odd issue on my end with my hardware or software setup, or congestion on our network. Any help is greatly appreciated, or direction to a better subreddit or forum to post this issue.

Ideas on making all tribes more interesting and/or balanced,Polytopia,1i9ckx1,2025-01-24 21:11:48,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polytopia/comments/1i9ckx1/ideas_on_making_all_tribes_more_interesting_andor/,John-Green223,Discussion,"This is a list of ideas to ""spice up"" boring and weak tribes while slightly nerfing the strongest OP tribes; such changes would be great cause there would be much greater diversity of tribes in online games instead of currently seeing mostly OP/strong tribes

so the thread is for those who like to dream of redesign/mods; some ideas may seems to be radical, but please just think how more fresh and interesting game would be and if it would cause any real imba! overall I think there should be more ""special stuff"" about tribes, just like right now there are only 4 special tribes; my intention was not to cause any general imba, but I acknowledge some ideas could make certain tribes very strong/specialized for certain contexts/maps. Note I'm speaking mostly from the perspective of high level 1v1 online random live games although I do consider team games 2v2 3v3.

digression: A few months ago I made on discord some posts about Aquarion and I'm so glad the things I suggested were actually implemented! Not sure if it's because I wrote them or devs came to same conclusions independently, but the fact remains! I suggested: shark attack 3.5 or movement 4; tridention hp 15 or movement 3. and its done! except with the case of Tridention movement=3 is conditional on bubble.

each entry is in the same order:

tribe shortname / stars it starts with / other changes

aq 5

pol 5

cym 4 / funghi cost 6 stars instead of 5 / 2 spores in capital instead of 2-3

ely 2 / sanctuaries: if there are animals on all adjacent trees to sanctuary then when u spawn poly respawn of new animal always takes 2 turns after spawning poly instead of how it is currently on even/uneven turns depending on when u placed sanctuary (so 1 or 2 turns since spawning poly); this applies only to a situation when all trees already had animals before spawning poly because otherwise the animal spawning counter (counting 2 turns till animal pops) may be applied to empty trees; so that means that spawning poly in a situation where sanctuary was saturated (all trees had animals) will always effectively cost 4 stars per poly (2 stars to spawn and 2 stars of lost income until new animal pops); right now effective cost is 3 or 4 stars depending on which turn you spawn poly; so this is a slight nerf to animal attraction speed and also it eliminates annoying way of optimization to have poly cost 3 stars by remembering even/uneven turns of each sanctuary

imp 2

kicko 2 / starts with raft on nearby random water field (closest to city) instead of warrior

zeb 3

bard 2

veng 5 / possession of maps: can see villages through the fog with special indicator (same way as Ely can see ruins); indicator is still visible (do not disappear) in the fog even after village was turned into city by non-visible enemies; can see lines of water vs land (bold lines with different colour in the fog of war), but not detailed terrain resources / 1.2 mountain spawn instead of default / 0.2 fruit spawn instead of 0.1 / 0.2 animal spawn instead of 0.1

aimo 5 / starts with Mind Bender instead of warrior / Meditation tech unlocks Mind Bender / Philosophy tech unlocks building unique unit Scout for 3s with stats 0-1-2, 2x vision, sneak, creep, independent ability and new 'tiny"" ability that makes it immediately visible only if enemy is standing on nearby field; its abilities are retained on Raft / metal spawn rate 1.2 instead of default

hood 5 / self-growing forests on the whole hood territory that is visible (so not under fog): each group of at least 2 connected tree fields causes growth of new trees on a random adjacent empty field (and farm field) every 3 turns (this could be rebalanced to 4-5 turns if too OP); so for example if there is group of 6 connected tree fields then this group will grow +1 tree field each 3 turns (so the more connected forests there are the slower the pace of new growth, though it can be managed through chopping to break connections and speed up new growth); diagonally connected trees also count as a group / expanded chopping ability: hood can chop one field more outside its city territory (if this territory is visible); so that includes stealing forests from nearby enemy cities) / removed “grow forest” ability from Spiritualism tech / optional balance change if it turns out that forest autogrowth is too strong (and if it also impacts too much other factions when they build on hood territory, eg how it could boost ely too much): if enemy builds or conquers city on hood territory then inside it’s borders terrain graphics turns into this factions graphics (same way as when Polaris freeze terrain) and forest auto-growth is stopped permanently; but when hood conquers any city the terrain remains as it was (so for hood enemies there would be additional benefit to build/conquer city on hood territory to disable hood's forest autogrowth even if for example enemy knows he may not keep this city and will lose it next turn)

yad 5 / cost of each road or bridge that creates city connection gets refunded by 1 star (example: if u build 2 roads to connect 2 close cities you will pay 6 stars and immediately gets refunded by getting 1 star) / can build double length bridges for 10 stars total

xin 6 / 1.5x attack bonus from mountains (in addition to defence bonus; if it’s too OP in testing then eg +1 attack bonus instead) / can build on mountains (eg markets, sawmills, monuments)

lux 6 / warrior unit is unlocked with Organization tech (so u can't build any unit on t0) / starting tech: Trade / lvl 4 city borders expansion choice expands twice the size (2 fields in all directions instead of 1)

oum 5 / healing boost inside city borders (includes city itself): 5 instead of 4

quetz 5 / Cloaks cost 6 stars instead of 8 / cities of all levels have 1 extra unit capacity (so lvl 1 city may build 3 units)"
Moving Supabase to external instance,Supabase,1i9ceqb,2025-01-24 21:02:36,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1i9ceqb/moving_supabase_to_external_instance/,Legitimate_Cancel122,database,"So I use a hosted version of Supabase with an XL. I have to run 100s of functions all the time, and each function is calculating a sports metric - let’s say there’s 1 player with 200 calculable metrics, I have to run each function, which each individually scans my 3M row table. I cannot make all functions calculate off a single table read, and thus, when I am wanting to run 100s of players for comparable, I am *starting* to hit unpreventable timeouts due to many thousand function calculations executing. 

I’ve pushed the indexes as far as they can realistically go. My gut says I need to move to Supabase open-source, on a cloud instance that is cheaper and more controllable from a scalability POV.

My questions:

Am I missing an obvious optimization? I’m not a data ops guy, I’m a full stack guy with average understanding of DB performance.

Can I achieve more power for a better price by moving to an external hosting option?

Completed Honour mode thanks to you! Here are my insights,BaldursGate3,1i92jjp,2025-01-24 13:38:44,121,0.96,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1i92jjp/completed_honour_mode_thanks_to_you_here_are_my/,FaithXIII,General Discussion - [SPOILERS],"Yesterday, I finally completed my Honour mode run after three failed attempts. To make it easier for other players, I’m writing this walkthrough, including the builds I used, the mistakes I made, and tips so you can avoid those pitfalls. Also, a big thanks to **Sherlaine-** for the pinned guides—they were incredibly helpful, especially from Act 2 to the end.

My characters (all build guides are from gamestegy, thanks guys!):

Tav - Ranger  
Started as a Beast Master because summons were strong early IMO, and after a failed run at Myrkul I needed a disarm which was the bear, he was the MVP there! After the Myrkul fight I respec to Dual Hand Crossbow Build. It was much stronger than the Beast master.

Final equipment:  
Hand crossbow +2  
Hand crossbow +1  
Rhapsody  
Dolor Amarus  
Helm of Balduran  
Cloak of Protection  
The Graceful Cloth  
Legacy of the Masters  
Bonespike Boots  
Periapt of Wound Closure  
Strange Conduit Ring  
Eversight Ring

Lae'zel- Champion fighter (MVP all across Act 3)

Final equipment:  
Balduran's Giantslayer (Giant form gives good bonus for All in attack rolls)  
The Dead Shot  
Sarevok's Horned Helmet  
Cloak of Displecement  
Helldusk Armour  
Helldusk Gloves  
Boots of Persistence  
Surgeon's Subjugation Amulet  
Risky Ring  
Killer's Sweeetheart

Karlach - Throwzerker Barbarian (Carried the Act 1 & 2, get returning pike ASAP)

Final equipment:  
Nyrulna  
Knife of the Undermountain King  
Hellrider Longbow  
Helmet of Grit  
Fleshmelter Cloak  
Bhaalist Armour  
Flawed helldusk gloves  
Helldusk Boots  
Amulet of greater Health  
Ring of Flinging  
Caustic Band

Shadowheart - War Domain  
I did not know how to use her properly, she was just a healer. one more body to evade Game Over. At the end of the game I respecd her to War Domain for the Raphael fight (Hold Monster), but still were not as strong as the other 3 characters

Final equipment:  
The Sacred Star  
Viconia's Walking Fortress  
Gontr Mael  
Hood of the Weave  
Cloak of the Weave  
Luminous Armour  
The Reviving Hands  
Disintegrating Night Walkers  
Spellcrux Amulet  
Coruscation Ring  
Callous Glow Ring

DO:

Pick up everything, you will need gold for Act 3 to buy the necessary items, buffs, etc. Send to camp the picked up items, most importantly heavy armors because they can even sell for 200 each, jewellry does not weight much but has good value.

Recruit the bard from Withers and NEVER LEVEL UP her. She will be the one who trade with vendors who have expensive items especially in Act 3. Give the vendor with 400 coins so they will have -50% sale.

Act 1

Route: SH --> Astarion -->Gale --> Lae'zel recruits --> Explore the Ruins quest. CAREFUL, don't underestimate the enemy bandits in the crypt (Took away the first run from me :') ) --> Druid groove (check on every npc) --> Investigate the Beach --> Go out --> Kill the windmill goblins --> Recruit Karlach --> Kill the ""paladins"" to get a good two-handed weapon --> Don't go to help the missing shipment npc-s yet, but kill the other gnolls in the area --> go south to get information about Kagha's betrayal --> go to kagha, you can choose to kill her during the conversation so others won't be hostile and getting a good necklace from her which can be synergy with Helm of Balduran in act 3 (I missed this opportunity) --> Go and kill the owlbear mama (and papa), while the cub has to live --> go to goblin camp (BUY THE RETURNING PIKE) --> go to ragzlin, kill him, and everybody else, it is your choice to knock out Minthara or not (I killed her for the mind flayer specimen), rescue halsin --> Help in the missing shipment  you choice to take the beholder summon item or take the shipment for exclusive item --> help at waukeen rest --> kill the phase spider matriarch --> get the necromany tome, unlock them because the summon spell can be good later --> now you should be Level 5 so go challenge auntie ethel, you should be strong enough to kill her before she reach the basement so a lot of pain in the \*ss will be negated, yeah you will skip the hair buff beacuse of this, but I was good without it

Went to underdark first --> phalar --> go to mushroom kingdom --> save the husband for a good pair of gloves for Karlach --> do as much as possible in the underdark befor going grymforge, kill the beholder, in the arcane tower get the ""password"" for bernard or you will not have a good time --> go to grymforge, get equipments, kill nere, get the rewards from mushroom people.

BEFORE YOU GO FOR THE ADAMANTITE FORGE GO TO MONASTERY TO BE STRONGER FOR THE GRYM FIGHT

Rosymorn Monastery was piece of cake after underdark, you can kill everybody after the vlaakith cutscene, but be sure to get the items I listed for sure.

Go back for the grym fight, summons are good especially the ravens for agroo and they can fly above the lava, you need to position the boss to the middle for the hammer.

GG go to act 2 through grymforge

Act 2

Go to last light inn, DON'T SPEAK AT ISOBEL AT ALL! AT ALL! meet with every other npc-s get items from vendors --> go to the kar'niss ambush, get the moonlantern and free the pixie --> go to moonrise towers, get the free +2 str from Araj, get equipments --> kill the Thorm family members the surgeon, the barist and...surprise was for me the coin lover boss (I haven't met her before and luckily I got her killed through conversations) --> do as many quests you can before entering the mausoleum, SKIP THE Shadow-Cursed Shambling Mound, it does not worth and you can get wiped --> Tried the Halsin survival quest, unsuccesfully, thanks for the ride Halsin --> In mausoleum kill Balthazar at the first encounter, easier imo ->you can kill yurgir if you want for the crossbow, I recruited him for Raphael and the end fight -> do the shar trials -> WARNING! WARNING! **WARNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING**! - Maybe you don't know but be careful with the platform that bring down to the nightsong, go down with one party member, then the others will be teleported to the waypoint --> I rescued Aylin --> Z'rell was easy, proning bosses with throwzerker Karlach so much fun --> go for ketheric, focus him then you can deal with the adds after he escapes --> in the colony skip the Necrotic laboratory --> Okay now breathe in and prepare for a not easy fight where a disarm would be mvp for myrkul. Scratch is good to be invisible to rescue aylin asap, kill the mindflayer first and then the skeletons as well. If you can disarm Myrkul you can easily kill him, and don't have to fear too much on the melee range. (By the way Myrkul took my second run)

In the astral prism I converted all my 4 characters into partial illithid. Fly and  [Psionic Dominance](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Psionic_Dominance) are op and the  [Illithid Expertise](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Illithid_Expertise) can help a lot for my main char, Tav.

Act 3

I skipped a lot of quests, locations because I am going only for lvl 12, getting the necessary equipments, and money

Leave SH in camp and get the Hellrider longbow from Ferg Drogher (if SH is in your party he won't let you trade under specific circumstances) --> pickpocket the ring from the genie and get myrulna and the ring from the jungle --> if karlach does not have dual wielding respec her --> TBH pick up everything you can get for gold, exp, illithid powers

In lower city ASAP go to jellywig for better prices at the vendors, follow  **Sherlaine-**'s guide.

Got the unholy assassin because there were important items from the vendor (like Bhaalist armor)

Bosses in my order

Ethel - tricky and was not an easy fight, kill the Pearlspore Bells asap, whenever I was able I targeted Ethel and AOEd the clones, otherwise killing the adds.

Mystic Carrion - I underestimated this even I destroy 3 of his urns. The aoe is strong and need to deal with the adds, the resistances helps him much.

Lorrokan - very easy fight was, focused the elementals but eventually killed him first.

Ansur - Killed my 3rd run. IMPORTANT: When his HP goes down to 0 he gets back 1+100 hp and starts charging. You can try to kill him - good luck -, but I strongly advise to hide, or go far as can, I went with Karlach back to the entrance, so I was able to dodge the full wipe then threw healing potions on the other characters (Check the [Ansur's Ire](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Ansur%27s_Ire_(Condition)) debuff, if your character does not have it you are safe). You can push elementals with Thunderwave.

Sarevok - Focus him, ????, profit. It was an easy kill.

Cazador - Focused him mostly, even in his Misty Escape form was possible to dmg him. At the start of the fight focus with aoe on the grouped monsters (Karlach Myrulna FTW).

Steel Watch Titan - I did not have the bomb because Wulbren died in Act 2. Focus on titan, it will go to def matrix so you kill the adds and you can kill the titan with patience.

Gortash - Destroyed the [Micromodron Force Curtain](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Micromodron_Force_Curtain) and the focused him, ez like Sarevok was.

Orin - You can easily skip this fight but be aware if not. I gave invisibility to Lae'zel, enlarged her with the Baldurian Giantslayer's buff and was able to throw out Orin. If you were not able to throw out...erm...git gud...I heard magic missiles help you :D

Viconia Devir - God...I almost had to try again for the fifth time, it was not an easy fight, I strongly recommend the high dmg AOE and even summons to get aggro. I am not going into much details, I did my best to survive and at the end I was able with 2 low hp characters. I recommend to kill everybody, ofc Viconia is the main target, but the lesser is always the better and focus those enemies that can cast darkness because it can counter the ranged attacks

Raphael - Last fight of course before the endgame. I was so scared of this fight, so to be sure I placed smokepowder barrels in an U form to destroy the pillars and smokepowder bombs to chain them together (with 12 barrels I was able to destroy 2 pillars). [Psionic Dominance](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Psionic_Dominance) give me a free round without Raphy could do anything, thanks to his ""charming"" personality Lae'zel killed all the adds then Raphy was so ez.

I rescued Orpheus. +1 character.

Netherbrain - God...I saw a speedrun where the brain can be killed with fireworks, and guess what, I left them in my personal chest in the camp...git gud now. Nonethless thanks again **Sherlaine-** for the video with the Artisty of War scroll and with 5 perilous stakes I was able to deal 497 dmg to the Dragon. First I repositioned myself with Karlach to trigger the  [**Fire Breath**](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Fire_Breath_(Dragons)) and then I almost oneshotted the Dragon with Tav. With Perilous Stakes I was able to easily kill the remaining adds focusing the Emperor and mind flayers. I flew on the sides ignoring the tentacles.  
After this everybody was ready to enter to the brain...and...I killed the brain in my first turn...wtf just happened? :D Lae'zel owned it very much dealing almost 300 dmg with only basic attacks. Viconia was much harder than this.

Skipped completely in Act 3:  
Finding Dribbles  
Avenge the Drowned  
Minsc  
Counting House/Return Rakath's Gold  
Save the Gondians (I even killed Zanner Toobin to get information disabling the Steel Watchers)

I’ve only completed the game fully once on Balanced difficulty, but I’ve started multiple playthroughs since then. Honour mode has been my favorite by far. While I’m sure my builds aren’t fully optimized and I’ve missed a lot of mechanics, I still managed to complete the run successfully despite a few rough patches.

I hope this post helps you in your journey, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask! 😊"

Why is Laissez Faire so OP?,victoria3,1i909qa,2025-01-24 12:05:34,361,0.94,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1i909qa/why_is_laissez_faire_so_op/,lTheReader,Question,"Laissez Faire has Government Dividends Reinvestment double that of Interventionism (50%) and equal to to that of Cooperative Ownership (100%), while allowing you to have almost 0 Loan Interest Rate (literally 0 if you are Great Britain), and making capitalists invest 25% more while literally none other get a similar bonus, except Cooperative Ownership which gets the bonus to its goddamn farmers. It also gives an extra company for good measure. 

It may be just the others being really weak as well, but this sh\*t is ridicilous. You can eaisly have double the GDP and a similar SoL at the same year by simply choosing Laissez Faire over others.

What's up with Fascism being op as well anyway?

Ink optimistic rollup now has $105.69M in TVS (total value secured).,ethtrader,1i8wut5,2025-01-24 09:39:58,12,0.87,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i8wut5/ink_optimistic_rollup_now_has_10569m_in_tvs_total/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Technicals,"Ink is one of the latest optimistic rollups, and it's built with the OP Stack by Kraken. Looks like it's already creating some numbers in the Ethereum ecosystem. It already has a TVS of $105.69M, and it has already established itself as the third Stage 1 rollup, right behind Arbitrum One (1st place) and Optimism (2nd place).

Ink’s stage 1 performance has been so good that even Vitalik himself congratulated the team. Joining the ranks of Ethereum’s most reliable rollups is very hard just so you know. And just like Base, Ink focuses on accountability and high development standards and that stance is already paying off. This achievement shows Kraken’s commitment to scaling Ethereum and preaching decentralization.

Ink’s growth proves that Ethereum keeps evolving and pushing toward decentralization. Rollups are essential to Ethereum’s L2 scaling solutions. They help the network process transactions faster and cheaper without compromising on security or decentralization.

I am curious to find out if we will see a future where more exchanges like Kraken join the rollup space. If so, once again Ethereum will be the winner.

Top Performance Testing Tools for SAP Fiori Applications,u_ImpactQA,1i8s1b7,2025-01-24 04:58:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ImpactQA/comments/1i8s1b7/top_performance_testing_tools_for_sap_fiori/,ImpactQA,,"When was the last time you waited for a website to load and thought, “This is taking forever”? Slow load times and laggy interfaces are the bane of modern web applications, especially in an enterprise environment. When it comes to SAP Fiori applications, performance is crucial for both user satisfaction and overall business productivity. How well these apps perform under pressure directly impacts an organization’s efficiency and operational success. This is why SAP Fiori performance testing is non-negotiable. 

SAP Fiori offers a user-friendly interface for enterprise applications, but it’s also complex, relying on multiple back-end services, data connections, and a variety of devices and browsers. This makes testing performance a challenging, yet essential, task. The good news is that there are several tools available today designed to address these challenges and ensure your SAP Fiori applications deliver the performance that users expect.  

In this blog, we will explore some of the best performance testing tools for SAP Fiori applications. From open-source to enterprise-grade options, these tools help you test speed, scalability, load handling, and overall app performance to ensure that everything runs smoothly when your organization needs it most. 

# Why SAP Fiori Performance Testing Matters 

Before diving into the best performance testing tools, let’s first understand why performance testing for SAP Fiori is so important. SAP Fiori applications are designed to run on various devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Their primary aim is to provide a consistent and smooth user experience across platforms. When these applications fail to perform under load or struggle to manage large-scale usage, it not only disrupts business operations but also leads to dissatisfied users.  

SAP Fiori performance testing ensures that your application can handle real-world traffic and scale as required, all while delivering a positive user experience. With the rise in remote work, digital transformation, and cloud adoption, users expect applications to be responsive and highly available at all times. Testing these factors becomes essential before deployment.  

**Key Performance Metrics for SAP Fiori** 

The core metrics you should focus on when performing SAP Fiori performance testing: 

1. ***Response Time –*** How long does it take for an action (e.g., loading a page or submitting data) to complete? 

1. ***Throughput –*** How many transactions or requests can the system handle in a given period?   

1. ***Scalability –*** How well does the app handle increased traffic or larger data volumes? 

1. ***Concurrent Users –*** How many users can interact with the system simultaneously without degrading performance? 

1. ***Resource Utilization –*** How efficiently the application uses CPU, memory, bandwidth, and other system resources.  

# The Top Performance Testing Tools for SAP Fiori Applications 

Now that we’ve discussed the importance of performance testing, let’s take a closer look at the best tools available for SAP Fiori performance testing. 

**1. Apache JMeter** 

Apache JMeter is one of the most widely used performance testing tools, renowned for its ability to simulate loads and analyze application performance. It’s an open-source tool that supports a variety of testing types, including load testing, stress testing, and functional testing. JMeter is especially beneficial for SAP Fiori applications due to its ability to test both the frontend (browser) and backend (SAP servers, APIs) components. 

For SAP Fiori, JMeter can simulate real users interacting with your app to measure response times, throughput, and latency. Its powerful scripting capabilities allow testers to replicate complex user scenarios and assess the app’s behavior under different conditions, such as varying network speeds or device types.

# Best Practices for SAP Fiori Performance Testing 

To ensure that SAP Fiori performance testing delivers accurate results, follow these best practices: 

1. **Test Across Devices:** Since SAP Fiori is designed to work across a range of devices, ensure that your performance tests are conducted on multiple platforms such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. 

1. **Simulate Real-World Scenarios:** Create test scripts that mirror the behaviors of real users to get a clear picture of how your application performs under load. 

1. **Conduct Load and Stress Testing:** Load testing simulates normal conditions, while stress testing pushes the app beyond its limits to identify potential issues in extreme conditions. 

1. **Monitor the Server-Side Performance:** Ensure that you monitor the backend SAP servers during the tests to identify issues with data processing or response times. 

1. **Optimize Continuously:** Performance testing is not a one-time event. Continuously test your SAP Fiori applications to ensure they maintain high performance as the app evolves and user numbers grow. 

# Conclusion 

[Performance testing](https://www.impactqa.com/guides/performance-testing/) is a crucial part of maintaining a smooth, responsive SAP Fiori application. Choosing the right tool can be the difference between smooth operations and frustrating performance issues. From JMeter’s flexibility to Neoload’s SAP-specific capabilities, there is no shortage of tools to help you achieve your performance testing goals. 

The key takeaway is that SAP Fiori applications are not simple websites; they rely on various back-end processes that can easily cause performance bottlenecks. With the right performance testing tools, businesses can ensure their SAP Fiori applications perform optimally under all conditions, improving both user experience and overall productivity. "
How to walk off post op gas with limited space?,gallbladders,1i8ra4k,2025-01-24 03:59:59,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1i8ra4k/how_to_walk_off_post_op_gas_with_limited_space/,beingmellymel,Questions,"Hi all, long time lurker & first time poster. I found out I have gallstones after 5-6 attacks since August 2024. Two of these episodes sent me to the ER and my second visit I was finally able to get a long awaited diagnosis! 

Anyway, I have surgery today at 1pm and I’m very excited to finally get this organ out of me! I have read a lot about post op gas pain & how walking it off really helps. I have a bit of an issue, I live in a fairly small apartment AND in a cold climate. It’s supposed to hit single digits this weekend so walking outside is out of the question for me. 

Did anyone do any adventures to the grocery store or to target to walk around getting the gas out? I understand it’s not optimal for those around me so I would likely go to a more desolate store (maybe like a hardware store). But want to make sure with the recovery pain and going out in public- if this is a smart option or if I’m setting myself up for failure/embarrassment. Should I just deal with walking back and forth between my front door and living room? 

Also my mom will be here for the weekend so I have someone to help me the first few days- if that matters for your answer. "

Greetings from The First Berserker: Khazan.

We’ve summarized the key questions and answers from yesterday’s AMA for our players. Thank you for your enthusiastic participation and interest in the game.

# - AMA Summary -

# [Questions About the Dev Team]

* **Philosophy and Vision:** The dev team focused on designing combat around ""challenge and achievement"" and ""the joy of battle,"" emphasizing the satisfaction players feel when overcoming difficulties.
* **Inspiration and Influences:** While Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) was the primary inspiration, elements from other titles such as Nioh, Sekiro, Ghost of Tsushima, Dark Souls, and Diablo have also influenced the design of *The First Berserker: Khazan*.
* **Story Structure:** Players familiar with Dungeon & Fighter will enjoy nostalgic elements and fresh depth, while new players can enjoy the game without prior knowledge of the original lore.
* **Technical Challenges:** To bring the appeal of Dungeon & Fighter to a wider audience, the team expanded its platform focus and transitioned into a single-player action RPG, concentrating on adapting to a new genre and platform.

# [Gameplay and Systems]

* **NG+ Feature:** All content is accessible during the first playthrough, but multiple endings and New Game+ allow for higher difficulty and unlocking additional options and abilities.
* **Weapon Types:** The full release will feature three weapon types (Dual Wield, Greatsword, and Spear), the same as in the DEMO. Additional weapon types through DLC or other options are still under consideration.
* **Playtime:** While an exact average is hard to provide, the estimated playtime for the True Ending is around 80 hours. The DEMO represents roughly 5% of the total content.
* **Mission Replay:** Missions can be replayed, and enemy or boss levels remain fixed, without scaling to the player's level.

# [Technical Details]

* **Optimization:** Some optimization issues were found on PS5 and Xbox, and improvements are underway. A few of these updates will also be applied to the DEMO version.
* **HDR Support:** While there are currently no plans for HDR support, the team is committed to ensuring the game’s unique graphics are well-presented across all platforms.

# [Content and DLC]

* **DLC Plans:** The plan and schedule for DLC have not yet been decided, but multiple game modes are under consideration.
* **Multiplayer:** Co-op will not be supported, but asynchronous content will be implemented.

# [Additional Questions and Answers]

* **Transmog:** Gear appearance customization will be unlocked after completing the first playthrough.

"Nieuw, 2m+ vermogen: hoe verdelen",DutchFIRE,1i8iucc,2025-01-23 19:39:02,85,0.73,319,https://www.reddit.com/r/DutchFIRE/comments/1i8iucc/nieuw_2m_vermogen_hoe_verdelen/,spartasupporter,Beginner,"Hoi iedereen,

Ik (23, m) ben al sinds mijn 18e erg geïnteresseerd in het FIRE verhaal (zonder toen destijds te weten dat dit een term had).

Sinds November 2023 ben ik begonnen in de crypto met een klein bedrag en sta ik momenteel rond de 2.2-2.3m qua vermogen. (Dit na 14 maanden 12-16u per dag op mijn kamer zitten en naar een scherm staren zonder consistent slaapritme). 

Dit vermogen is momenteel verdeelt als volgt:

- 200k op de bank
- 900k in USDC (dus dollar stable coin, cash ik momenteel uit ri. bank)
- 900k in Sol
- 250k in Hype

In principe staat 1.1m al veilig. Ik weet dat een gedeelte van deze redditpage een hekel heeft aan crypto dus laten we daar aub niet op focussen. Worst case trek ik de rest eruit als het daalt met max 50%. In de tussentijd genereer ik nog winst. Dit zijn echter geen consistente bedragen dus laat ik hier buitenwegen.

EDIT: Er werd opgemerkt dat USDC niet veilig is (voor normale wereldbegrippen). Ik ben het hier ook mee eens. Op het moment neem ik 100k/dag op. Dit verdeel ik vervolgens op Raisin (zodat ik onder depositogarantie val) in depositos die 3 maanden vast staan of spaarrekeningen die 2.8% bieden. Ik weet dat dit niet optimaal is, maar ik wil idd het geld z.s.m. uit de crypto hebben en op echte rekeningen. Mocht iemand hier een ander goed idee voor hebben hoor ik het graag

Momenteel woon ik nog thuis, ik heb afgelopen Augustus mijn master  afgerond. Ik heb dus geen vaste kosten buiten een zorgverzekering.

In de toekomst ben ik van plan om uit huis te gaan en samen te gaan wonen met mijn vriendin. Vriendin moet eerst haar studie afmaken in Duitsland, dit zal nog 1-2 jaar duren.  Aangezien ik zelf niet werkzaam ben (net klaar met studie) en mijn vriendin nog een master hierna gaat doen krijg ik ook geen hypotheek. Een huis kopen betekent dus het hele bedrag in een keer aftikken.

Ik bevind me eigenlijk in een unieke situatie op mijn leeftijd, hiervan ben ik mij bewust. 

Ik heb zelf al nagedacht over een paar situaties aan de hand van advies gelezen hier op de redditpage en eigen (hopelijk gezond) verstand maar ik zou het heel erg fijn vinden als iemand met meer verstand nog opmerkingen heeft.

Situatie 1:

- koophuis rond de 500k
- tussen de 20-50k op de bank als buffer mocht er iets gebeuren
- rest beleggen (1-1.5m minimum over hiervoor)

Situatie 2:

- huurhuis (500k meer vrij vermogen)
- 20-50k op de bank
- rest beleggen (1.5-2m minimum over hiervoor)

Normaliter is het advies hier om het grotendeel te gaan beleggen als je jong bent omdat je het risico van een agressieve strategie kan verdragen op lange termijn. (7% gemiddeld op jaarbasis). Ik vroeg me af of dit in mijn situatie ook optimal zou zijn of dat het toch handig is om mijn portfolio op te splitsen in meerdere categorieën zoals bijv. toch een stukje obligaties en deposito sparen (rentes zijn wel laag momenteel).

Verder vind ik de kwestie koophuis vs huurhuis ook erg lastig omdat er in principe geld wordt geparkeerd en vastgezet. De vraag is of het geïnvesteerde bedrag bij een huurhuis minus de huurkosten betere resultaten boekt dan de waardestijging van het koophuis.

Ik vraag me heel erg af op welke manier ik het slimste (dus enigzins veilig) FIRE zou kunnen worden door alleen maar gebruik te maken van dit vermogen.

Omdat het over serieuze bedragen gaan die ongelooflijk snel aan zijn komen waaien heb ik aankomende dinsdag ook een gesprek ingepland met een financieel adviseur om het hier verder over te hebbben. In de tussentijd blijft mijn hoofd maar malen over koophuis/huurhuis en de splitsing van beleggingen dus hierbij ook mijn post.

Sorry voor de lap tekst, misschien is hij lastig te lezen 🤣. Alle antwoorden zijn erg welkom"

I enjoy theory crafting even if I never put in in practice.

How hard do you think the game enemy within, and war of chosen be if enemy had double enemies in pods and double amount of pods. This includes chosen (so four chosen can crash your map at once, through split in two groups but does not include rulers (they do not need any buffs) 

Also troops take twice as long to recover from wounds and fatigue, and receive a strain bonus of 12 hours for each turn taken , where they cannot recover and have one less action point. 

Also lost now target advent just as much as XCOM but in exchange, each headshot does one less damage to them for harder headshot chaining.

Also endless enemies spawns stop giving exp when spawned on round 20 or later.

In exchange XCOM receives the following upgrades.

That XCOM baby protection, where the first time in a field one solder is reduced to zero health, they have their hitpoints increased to one.

Second one

Xcom gets an another column and row to build with.

Also the following new buildings which cost 200 money/supply times the number of the building built

training quarter which lets Xcom assigned one higher rank soldier to train a lesser rank solder, giving them a promotion, and in Xcom 1 they get a extra hit point where as in Xcom 2 they give 5 skill points and a random covert op solder boon.

And warfare optimization lab, which gives plus two aim, crit chance, will, psi offense, hack to all your guys, if you put a scientist and engineer in it which 

Finally, cowering civilians get plus four hit points, and plus 30 defense for terror mission sanity. Defend the x objectives also have double health.

Do you think classic would be harder than impossible, or impossible be reasonable to do with all but the most sweaty of XCOM players with this tweaks.

I've been wanting to try out NixOS for a while and finally took the plunge by setting up a proper build pipeline using Packer on Hetzner Cloud. I documented my experience in a blog post, hoping it might help others who are curious about the same stack.

What you'll find:
- Complete Packer configuration for building NixOS 24 snapshots
- The entire setup script including disk partitioning and NixOS configuration
- Real challenges I faced
- Bonus OpenTofu code for deploying servers from the snapshot

I'm definitely not a NixOS expert, and there might be better ways to do this. The configs are working but probably not optimal - I tried to document my thought process and include necessary explanations for each step.

If you've implemented something similar or have suggestions for improvements, I'd love to hear your approach. The main goal is to learn and share experiences with the community.

>For the Blackwell RTX 50 series launch, NVIDIA strategically chose to introduce their flagship model first, launching the GeForce RTX 5090 ahead of other models to set a high benchmark in performance. Following this release, other models like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 are set to be launched, all of which we assume will also be impressive with DLSS 4 and their new design. The RTX 5090 remains the pinnacle in terms of raw power and capabilities and is in a class of its own, alongside its high price tag.

>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition’s powerful performance make it an essential upgrade for enthusiasts and professionals aiming to push the limits of what’s possible in their digital environments. Purists will not enjoy DLSS 4 and will want a much larger raw performance jump, but for those that do the performance uplift will make you drop your jaw just like it did to ours. We remember titles like Hogwarts Legacy having performance issues at launch and with DLSS 4 enabled we saw incredibly high gains of 301.6 AI generated FPS performance difference over its raw power. Nothing can replace proper optimization but expanding the capabilities of a game to perform in such large amounts is amazing.

>Going into this review, it was clear that there was some trepidation that the RTX 5090 wouldn't offer enough of a performance advantage over its predecessor when it comes to raw frame-rates, ie without the multi frame generation tech that Nvidia leaned heavily on in its pre-release marketing. These are justifiable concerns - after all, there's no die shrink to accompany this generation of processors, and pushing more power can only get you so far.

>Thankfully - for those that want to justify upgrading to a $2000+ graphics card - the beefier design and faster GDDR7 memory do deliver sizeable gains over the outgoing 4090 flagship, measured at around 31 percent on average at 4K. The differentials are understandably smaller when you look at lower resolutions - just 17 percent at 1080p, though anyone considering the 5090 is probably unlikely to be rocking a 1080p display. Nvidia, Intel, AMD and Sony have all spoken about the slowing progress in terms of silicon price to performance, and we can see why all four companies are now [looking to machine learning](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald) technologies to shore up generational advancements.

>Speaking of which, DLSS 4's multi frame generation is an effective tool for pushing frame-rates - though arguably not *performance* to higher levels. On the RTX 5090, it's best used along similarly high-end 4K 144Hz+ monitors, so it's no surprise that Nvidia and its partners ensured that reviewers had access to 4K 240Hz screens for their testing. If you're lucky enough to be in that situation, you can use MFG to essentially max out your monitor's refresh rate, with a choice of 1x, 2x or 3x frame generation.

>There's of course a trade-off in terms of latency, but it's smaller than you might think - and once you've already enabled frame generation, knocking it up an extra level has only a small impact on thos latency figures. For example, in [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077) with RT Overdrive (path tracing), we saw frame-rates go with 94.5fps with DLSS upscaling to 286fps when adding 4x multi frame generation, a \~3x multiplier at the cost of \~9ms of added latency (26ms vs 35ms). If you have a 4K 240Hz monitor, that might be a trade worth taking - and of course, you're more than free to ignore frame generation and knock back other settings instead to get performance to a level you're happy with.

# [Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/review/review-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-reference-edition/)

>The RTX 5090 features an advanced rendering engine that pushes past previous limits with the help of its  21,760 CUDA cores. This means smoother and faster gameplay with more realistic environments, creating an immersive experience. The RTX 50 series introduced a new generation of Ray tracing and Tensor cores. These aren’t just numbers on a spec sheet – they represent a leap in efficiency and power. Located close to the shader engine, these cores work tirelessly to deliver distinctive outputs. Even though Tensor cores can be tricky to measure, their impact is unmistakable, especially when paired with DLSS3.5 and new DLSS4 with MFG  technology that delivers impressive results. The GeForce RTX 5090 is not just an enthusiast-class card; it's a versatile powerhouse. Whether playing games at 2K (2560x1440) or better yet, game at 4K (3840x2160), it offers superlative performance at every resolution. This makes it an outstanding choice for gamers who seek both quality and speed, transporting them into new realms of interactive entertainment

>Depending on the game title this value can greatly differ! However, on average you're looking at 25% maybe 30% more traditional rendering performance. The thing is though, NVIDIA has invested a lot of the transistor budget into AI, Deeplearning and Neural shading. We've presented the numbers with DLSS4 and when you enable frame generation mode at 4x, the performance is astounding. The reality is that we are reaching physical limits where traditional methods of increasing performance are becoming harder than ever. Chips would have to grow even larger, power consumption would skyrocket, and costs would soar. Imagine a future where every attempt to push technology further leads to larger, more power-hungry chips that become increasingly expensive. As we encounter these boundaries, think creatively and seek new solutions. Instead of following a path that leads to dead ends, this challenge invites us to innovate and discover groundbreaking ideas such as DLSS4 and MFG.

>If you factor out pricing and energy consumption, it's gonna be hard to not be impressed with the GeForce RTX 5090. The card drips and oozes performance and it all packs into a two-slot form factor. On the traditional shader rasterizer part, it's still a good notch faster than RTX 4090, however, if you are savvy with technologies like DLSS4 offers, the sky is the limit. We do hope to see more backwards compatibility with DLSS 4 so that older games will get this new tech included as well. DLSS4 is not perfect though, yes butter smooth, but in Alan Wake 2 for example the scene rendered was fantastic but we; see birds flying over in the sky leaving a weird hale trail. The scene was otherwise very nice though.  The Blackwell GPU architecture of the 5090 demonstrates proficient performance. It boasts about 1.25 to sometimes 1.50 times the raw shader performance compared to its predecessor, along with enhanced Raytracing and Tensor core capabilities.

# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)

>NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 is the fastest, most powerful, and feature-rich consumer GPU in the world as of today, period. There’s no other way to put it. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition card itself is also a refined piece of hardware. To design a card that offers significantly more performance than an RTX 4090, at much higher power levels, in a roughly 33% smaller form factor is no small feat of engineering. The card also looks great in our opinion. On its own, the GeForce RTX 5090 is currently unmatched in the consumer GPU market – nothing can touch it in terms of performance, with virtually any workload – AI, content creation, gaming, you name it.

>It's not all sunshine and rainbows, though. In many cases, the GeForce RTX 5090 offered nearly double the performance of its predecessor (RTX 3090) when it debuted, at lower power, while using the exact same settings and workloads. If you compare the GeForce RTX 5090 to the RTX 4090 at like settings, however, the RTX 5090 is “only” about 25% - 40% faster and consumes more power. The RTX 5090’s $1,999 MSRP is also significantly higher than the 4090’s $1,599 price tag. Considering the Ada and [Blackwell GPUs](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-architecture-overview) at play here are manufactured on the same TSMC process node, NVIDIA was still able to move the needle considerably, but the GeForce RTX 5090 doesn’t represent the same kind of monumental leap the RTX 4090 did when it launched, if you disregard its new rendering technologies at least.

>You can’t disregard those new capabilities, though. Neural Rendering, DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, the updated media engine, and all that additional memory and memory bandwidth all have to be taken into consideration. When playing a game that can leverage Blackwell’s new features, the GeForce RTX 5090 can indeed be more than twice as fast as [the RTX 4090](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gpu-review).

>The use of frame generation has spurred much discussion since its introduction, and we understand the concerns regarding input latency and potential visual artifacts that come from using frame-gen. But the fact remains, using AI and machine learning to boost game and graphics performance in the most effective and efficient way forward at this time. Moving to more advanced manufacturing process nodes doesn’t offer the kind of power, performance and area benefits it once did, so boosting performance must ultimately come mostly from architectural and feature updates. And everyone in the PC graphics game is turning to AI. We specifically asked about the importance of traditional rasterization moving forward and were told development is still happening, and it will remain necessary for “ground truth” rendering to train the models, but ultimately AI will be generating more and more frames in the future.

# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review-the-600-watt-powerhouse-in-gaming-and-lab-tests/)

>The GeForce RTX 5090 delivered impressive results in practical tests. The card achieved significantly higher frame rates in Full HD, WQHD and Ultra HD compared to the RTX 4090, especially with DLSS and ray tracing support enabled. The multi-frame generation enables consistent frame pacing and reduces noticeable latency, which is particularly beneficial in fast and dynamic gaming scenarios. The improvements in patch tracing and ray tracing ensure a more realistic representation of complex scenes. Games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 visibly benefit from the technological advances and show that the Blackwell architecture has the potential to smoothly display the most demanding graphic effects.

>The image quality achieved by the Transformer models in DLSS 4 is another important aspect. Where previously a clear trade-off had to be made between performance and quality, DLSS 4 combines both in an impressive way. Most notably, the new Performance setting offers almost the same visual quality as previous Quality modes. This is achieved through advanced AI-powered models that capture both local details and global relationships to produce a near-native image representation. The smooth and detailed rendering at significantly higher frame rates shows that DLSS 4 is an essential part of the RTX 5090, further underlining its performance. There will be a detailed practical test on this from our monitor professional Fritz Hunter.

>In my opinion, the GeForce RTX 5090 is an impressive graphics card that shows just how far GPU technology has come. The new features in particular, such as DLSS 4 and Transformer-supported image optimization, set new standards. The performance of this card is simply breathtaking, be it in games in Ultra HD with active patch tracing or in demanding AI-supported applications. It is remarkable how NVIDIA has managed to find the balance between graphical excellence and innovative technologies. Another outstanding aspect is the ability of DLSS 4 to achieve an image quality that is almost indistinguishable from native resolutions, while at the same time increasing performance. The change from “Quality” to “Performance” as a standard option is like a revolution in the way we perceive image enhancement. The smooth display, combined with an incredible level of detail, takes the gaming experience to a new level.

>Much was made of the performance ahead of launch, people were breaking out rulers and [pixel counting Nvidia's bar charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1hvvrqj/50_vs_40_series_nvidia_benchmark_exact_numbers/), but after thorough testing today we can confirm native rendering performance has increased in the ballpark of 30% over the RTX 4090 when testing at 4K. That makes the RTX 5090 64% faster on average compared to AMD's current consumer flagship, the RX 7900 XTX, while it's also a 71% uplift over the RTX 4080 Super. Ray tracing also scales similarly, given we saw the exact same 29% margin over the RTX 4090 in the eight RT titles we tested.

>Those are the sort of performance increases you can expect at 4K, but the uplift does get progressively smaller as resolution decreases. Versus the RTX 4090, for instance, we saw smaller gains of 22% at 1440p and 18% at 1080p. Now, I don't expect many people will be gaming at native 1080p on an RTX 5090, but it's worth bearing that in mind if you'd typically game with DLSS Super Resolution. After all, using its performance mode at 4K utilises a 1080p internal render resolution. Clearly this is a card designed for 4K – and perhaps even above – but that performance scaling at lower resolutions could be something to bear in mind.

>Of course, whether or not you are impressed by those generational gains depends entirely on your perspective – an extra 30% over the 4090 could sound great, or it could be a disappointment. The main thing from my perspective as a reviewer is to give you, the reader, as much information as possible to allow you to make an informed decision, and I think I have done that today.

>Gamers do get the extra value add of DLSS 4, specifically Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is a new feature exclusive to the RTX 50-series. I spent a fair bit of time testing MFG as part of this review and I think if you already got on with Frame Generation on the RX 40-series, you'll probably find a lot to like with MFG. It's been particularly useful in enabling 4K/240Hz gaming experiences that wouldn't otherwise be possible – such as high frame rate path tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 – and with the growing [4K OLED monitor segment](https://www.kitguru.net/components/matthew-wilson/ces-2025-leo-gets-a-closer-look-at-new-msi-oled-monitors-dual-system-case-and-more/), that's certainly good news.

>However, it's definitely not a perfect technology as the discerning gamer will still notice some fizzling or shimmering that isn't otherwise there, while latency scaling is still backwards compared to what we've come to expect – in the sense that latency actually *increases* as frame rate increases with MFG, rather than latency decreasing. That means some will find it problematic as the *feel* doesn't always match up to the visual fluidity of the increased frame rate.

>It is great to see Nvidia is improving other aspects of DLSS, though, with its new Transformer-based models of Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. Not only do these improve things like ghosting and overall level of detail compared to the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, but this upgrade actually applies to *all* RTX GPUs, right the way back to the 20-series. There's even a possibility that Multi Frame Gen [might come to older cards](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/joao-silva/nvidia-multi-frame-generation-could-come-to-rtx-30-series-gpus/) given that Nvidia hasn't explicitly ruled it out, but personally I'd be surprised to see that happen given it currently acts as an incentive to upgrade to the latest and greatest.

>We can't end this review without a discussion of Nvidia's Founders Edition design, either. This is a *highly* impressive feat of engineering, considering it's a mere dual-slot thickness yet it is able to comfortably tame 575W of power. We saw the GPU settling at 72C during a thirty-minute 4K stress test, while the VRAM hit 88C, which is slightly warmer but still well within safe limits. I love to see the innovation in this department, as when pretty much every AIB partner is slapping quad-slot coolers onto their 5090s, this is a refreshing step back to a time when GPUs didn't cover the entire bottom-half of your motherboard.

# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/9132-nvidia-rtx-5090-founders-edition)

>Performance for the new generation of cards in my testing had the RTX 5090 outperforming the RTX 4090 by around 32% which is right in line with the increase in CUDA cores for the card. There were some tests which saw an even bigger increase and the RTX 5090 was at the top of the chart across the board in every applicable test. What was even more impressive to me was the improvements with DLSS 4, the performance difference that it can make is sometimes shocking, but on top of that Nvidia has improved the smoothness and picture quality. At the end of the day, there wasn’t anything that I threw at the RTX 5090 that slowed it down, but if you do run into something that it can’t handle DLSS 4 is going to fix you right up. I did see some bugs in my DLSS testing, mostly when trying down resolutions, but I suspect some of those will be smoothed out once the updates are released. The biggest issue I ran into performance-wise was that a few of our benchmarks just wouldn’t run at all and they were all OpenCL. Nvidia is aware and is working to get support for those tests.

>The big increase in performance without any change in manufacturing size does have the RTX 5090 having a significantly higher power consumption. I saw it pulling up to 648 watts at peak, combine that with today's highest-end CPUs and we are swinging back to needing high-wattage power supplies. Speaking of power, the power connection has been improved in a whole list of ways including moving from the original 12VHPWR connection to the changed design that is called 12V-2-6. It looks the same and all of the power supplies will still connect. But they have changed the pin heights to get a better connection and the sense pins are shorter and are more likely to catch when the plug isn’t connected all the way. On top of that Nvidia’s card design has recessed the connection down into the card and angled it to reduce any strain on the connection. They have also included a much nicer power adapter as well. All of that power does mean there is more heat but the double blow-through design handled it surprisingly well running similarly in temperatures to the RTX 4090 Founders Edition even with a thinner card design and a lot more wattage going through.

# [OC3D Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDxME5APa8)

>Speaking of DLSS 4, that comes with the big ticket item in the Blackwell release, Multi Frame Generation. By refining the algorithm, and giving the card newer generations of hardware, the RTX 5090 can now generate three extra frames from a single frame rendered. As you could see from our results in Alan Wake II, Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, the effect is considerable. Cyberpunk 2077, with an open world, neon soaked, usually wet and thus reflective environment is about as good as games can look. Turn on path-tracing and it’s nearly real life. That path-tracing has a massive performance cost though. On the RTX 4090 you get 133 FPS @ 4K without it, 40 FPS with it.

>Even turning DLSS and Frame Gen on doesn’t recoup all that, maxing out at 104. Click through the Multi Frame Gen settings on the RTX 5090 though and that number hits 241 FPS. With, and we cannot state this enough, NO loss in visual fidelity. That’s Cyberpunk at 4K with pathed ray-tracing turned on and a frame rate you’d require a very expensive monitor (4K@240Hz!) to appreciate fully. When CD Projekt Red’s Magnum Opus first appeared you could get smoother frame rates from a flipbook.

>All of which returns us to the way we’ve tested how we have. Because in regular mode, with DLSS turned on and, at most, a single frame generated as is currently the way, the RTX 5090 is another big step forwards on the best of the current cards. Anything which can stomp on a RTX 4090 is crazy good. That the RTX 5090 Founders Edition can do that, and then has much further to go with the benefits of MFG, makes any claims about it being a purely software-based improvement look as ill-informed as they do.

>Already that’s more than enough to make the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition a Day One recommendation to anyone serious about their gaming. We haven’t even mentioned the crazy low latencies – and thus higher KD ratio – of the upgraded Reflex 2 technology. Or RTX Neural Faces that can convert a 2D picture into a 3D character. We’ve not discussed, because it’s embryonic, the potential of the AI powered NPCs with the Nvidia Ace technology. Or the extra broadcast features, faster encoding and decoding, and all the AI calculation benefits having this much power at your disposal can bring.

>Simply put, the Nvidia RTX 5090 has coalesced all the current thinking on AI, performance, sharpness, and generative content into a single card that blows the doors off anything on the market. It’s the future, today.

# [PC Perspective](https://pcper.com/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-review/)

>Well, NVIDIA has topped NVIDIA. Once again, and with zero competition at the high end, GeForce reigns supreme. And while raster performance has risen, DLSS 4 is the star of the show with the RTX 50 Series, now supporting up to ***four*** generated frames per rendered frame (!) if you dare. Yes, the price for NVIDIA’s flagship has risen again, from $1599 to $1999 this generation, but those who want the fastest graphics card in the world will surely buy it anyway.

>The GeForce RTX 4090 stood unopposed as the ultimate gaming GPU since the moment it launched. No longer. The new Blackwell generation uses the same underlying TSMC 4N process technology as the RTX 40-series, so Nvidia couldn’t squeeze easy improvements there. Instead, the company overhauled the RTX 5090’s instruction pipeline, endowed it with 33 percent more CUDA cores, and pushed it to a staggering 575W TGP, up from the 4090’s 450W. Blackwell also introduced a new generation of RT and AI cores.

>Add it all up and the RTX 5090 is an unparalleled gaming beast — though the effects hit different depending on whether or not you’re using RTX features like ray tracing and DLSS.

>In games that *don’t* use ray tracing or DLSS, simply brute force graphics rendering, the RTX 5090 isn’t much more than a mild generational performance upgrade. It runs an average of 27 percent faster in those games — but the splits swing wildly depending on the game: *Cyberpunk 2077* is 50 percent faster, *Shadow of the Tomb Raider* is 32 percent faster, and *Rainbox Six Siege* is 28 percent faster, but *Assassin’s Creed Valhalla* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops 6* only pick up 15 and 12 percent more performance, respectively.

>Much like DLSS, DLSS 2, and DLSS 3 before it, the [new DLSS 4 generation](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&xs=1&url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/&xcust=2-1-2585806-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html) is an absolute game-changer. Nvidia’s boundary-pushing AI tech continues to look better, run faster, and now *feel* smoother. It’s insane.

>Nvidia made two monumental changes to DLSS to coincide with the RTX 50-series release. First, all DLSS games will be switching to a new “Transformer” model from the older “Convolutional Neural Network” behind the scenes, on all RTX GPUs going back to the 20-series.

>More crucially for the RTX 5090 (and future 50-series offerings), DLSS 4 adds a new Multi Frame Generation technology, building upon the success of [DLSS 3 Frame Gen](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html). While DLSS 3 uses tensor cores to insert a single AI-generated frame between GPU-rendered frames, supercharging performance, MFG inserts *three* AI frames between each GPU-rendered frame (which itself may only be rendering an image at quarter resolution, then using DLSS Super Resolution to upscale that to fit your screen).

>Bottom line: DLSS 4 is a stunning upgrade you *must* play around with to fully appreciate its benefits. It’s literally a game-changer, once again — though we’ll have to see if it feels *this* sublime on lower-end Nvidia cards like the more affordable RTX 5070.

>In a vacuum, the RTX 5090 delivers around a 30 percent average boost in gaming performance over the RTX 4090. That’s a solid generational improvement, but one we’ve seen throughout history delivered at the same price point as the older, slower outgoing hardware. Nvidia asking for an extra $500 on top seems garish and overblown from that perspective.

>While I wouldn’t recommend upgrading to this over the RTX 4090 for gaming (unless you’re giddy to try DLSS 4), it’s a definite upgrade option for the RTX 3090 and anything older. The 4090 was 55 to 83 percent faster than the 3090 in games, and the 5090 is about 30 percent faster than *that*, with gobs more memory.

>At the end of the day, nobody needs a $2,000 graphics card to play games. But if you *want* one and don’t mind the sticker price, this is easily the most powerful, capable graphics card ever released. The GeForce RTX 5090 is a performance monster supercharged by DLSS 4’s see-it-to-believe it magic.

# [Puget Systems (Content Creation Review)](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-content-creation-review/)

>Overall, the RTX 5090 is a beast of a card. Drawing 575 W, with 32 GB VRAM and a $2000 price tag (at least), it is overkill for many use cases. However, it excels at GPU-heavy workloads like rendering and provides solid performance improvements over the last-gen 4090 in many applications. There are some issues with software compatibility that need to be worked out, but historically, NVIDIA has been great about ensuring its products are properly supported throughout the software ecosystem.

>For **video editing and motion graphics**, the RTX 5090 performs well, with 10-20% improvements across the board. In particular sub-tests, where the workload is primarily GPU bound, we see up to 35% performance advantages over the previous-generation 4090. However, the area we are most excited about is actually the enhanced codec support for the NVENC/NVDEC engines. In DaVinci Resolve, the H.265 4:2:2 10-bit processing was more than twice as fast as software decoding and exceeded even what we see from Intel Quick Sync. Even if the 5090 is more than a workload requires, we are excited to see what this means for upcoming 50-series cards.

>In **rendering applications**, real-time and offline, the 5090 pushes its lead over previous-generation cards even further. It is 17% faster than the 4090 in our Unreal Engine benchmark while also offering more VRAM for heavy scenes. Offline renderers, such as V-Ray and Blender, score 38% and 35% higher than 4090, respectively. This more than justifies the $2,000 MSRP, especially factoring in the added VRAM. The lack of support for some of our normally-tested rendering engines is non-ideal, but we are hopeful NVIDIA will address that issue shortly.

>NVIDIA’s new GeForce RTX 5090 is a monster of a GPU, delivering best-in-class performance alongside a rich feature set. However, it comes along with a huge price tag of $2,000 MSRP; ad likely higher for most buyers, as AIB cards will be a good bit more expensive than that. It also requires that your computer can support that much power draw and heat. If you need the most powerful consumer GPU ever made, this is it. Otherwise, we are excited by what this promises for the rest of the 50-series of GPUs and look forward to testing those in the near future.

# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition/)

>At 4K resolution, with pure rasterization, without ray tracing or DLSS, we measured a 35% performance uplift over the RTX 4090. While this is certainly impressive, it is considerably less than what we got from RTX 3090 Ti to RTX 4090 (+51%). NVIDIA still achieves their ""twice the performance every second generation"" rule: the RTX 5090 is twice as fast as the RTX 3090 Ti. There really isn't much on the market that RTX 5090 can be compared to, it's 75% faster than AMD's flagship the RX 7900 XTX. AMD has confirmed that they are not going for high-end with RDNA 4, and it's expected that the RX 9070 Series will end up somewhere between RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE. This means that RTX 5090 is at least twice as fast as AMD's fastest next-generation card. Compared to the second-fastest Ada card, the RTX 4080 Super, the performance increase is 72%--wow!

>There really is no question, RTX 5090 is the card you want for 4K gaming at maximum settings with all RT eye candy enabled. I guess you could run the card at 1440p at insanely high FPS, but considering that DLSS 4 will give you those FPS even at 4K, the only reason why you would want to do that is if you really want the lowest latency with the highest FPS.

>Want lower latency? Then turn on DLSS 4 Upscaling, which lowers the render resolution and scales up the native frame. In the past there were a lot of debates where DLSS upscaling image quality is good enough, some people even claimed ""better than native""--I strongly disagree with that--I'm one of the people who are allergic to DLSS 3 upscaling, even at ""quality."" With Blackwell, NVIDIA is introducing a ""Transformers"" upscaling model for DLSS, which is a major improvement over the previous ""CNN"" model. I tested Transformers and I'm in love. The image quality is so good, ""Quality"" looks like native, sometimes better. There is no more flickering or low-res smeared out textures on the horizon. Thin wires are crystal clear, even at sub-4K resolution! You really have to see it for yourself to appreciate it, it's almost like magic. The best thing? DLSS Transformers is available not only on GeForce 50, but on all GeForce RTX cards with Tensor Cores! While it comes with a roughly 10% performance hit compared to CNN, I would never go back to CNN. While our press driver was limited to a handful of games with DLSS 4 support, NVIDIA will have around 75 games supporting it on launch, most through NVIDIA App overrides, and many more are individually tested, to ensure best results. NVIDIA is putting extra focus on ensuring that there will be no anti-cheat drama when using the overrides.

# [The FPS Review](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2025/01/23/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-video-card-review/)

>There is a lot to unpack in regards to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, and GeForce RTX 50 series from NVIDIA. A lot of technologies have been debuted, and there are a lot of features to test that we simply cannot do in one single review. In today’s review, we focused on the gameplay performance aspect of the GeForce RTX 5090.

>We focused on the GeForce RTX 5090 performance, so subsequent reviews will focus on the rest of the family, and we’ll have to see how they fit into the overall opinion of the RTX 50 series family this generation. For now, we can look at the GeForce RTX 5090 as the flagship of the RTX 50 series, and what it offers for the gameplay experience at a steep price of $1,999, a 25% price bump over the previous generation GeForce RTX 4090.

>If we look back at the average performance gains we saw in just regular raster performance, we experienced performance that ranged from 19%-48%, but there were a lot of common performance gains in the 30-33% range. We did have some outliers that were lower, and some higher, depending on the game and settings. We generally saw gains in the 30% region with Ray Tracing enabled, where scenarios were more GPU-bound.

>We think one problem that is being encountered is that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is becoming CPU-bound in a lot of games. The data tells us that perhaps even our AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is holding back the potential of the GeForce RTX 5090. Therefore, as newer, faster CPU generations are released, the GeForce RTX 5090’s performance advantage may increase over time. The GeForce RTX 5090 has powerful specifications, but the performance advantage we are currently seeing seems shy of what should be expected with those specifications. It may very well be the case that it is being held back, and it has more potential with better-optimized games or faster CPUs. Time will tell on that one.

>As it stands right now, you should always buy based on the current level of performance, not what might happen. Therefore, at this time you are seeing about a 33% gameplay performance advantage average, but with a 25% price increase, making the price-to-performance value very narrow. The facts are, that the GeForce RTX 5090 has no competition, it does offer the best gameplay performance you can get on the desktop.

# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review)

>The RTX 5090 is a lot like this initial review: It's a bit of a messy situation — a work in progress. We're not done testing, and Nvidia isn't done either. Certain games and apps need updates and/or driver work. Nvidia usually does pretty good with drivers, but new architectures can change requirements in somewhat unexpected ways, and Nvidia needs to continue to work on tuning and optimizing its drivers. We're also sure Nvidia doesn't need us to tell it that.

>Gaming performance is very much about running 4K and maxed out settings. If you only have a 1440p or 1080p display, you're better off saving your pennies and upgrading you monitor — and probably the rest of your PC as well! — before spending a couple grand on a gaming GPU.

>Unless you're also interested in non-gaming applications and tasks, particularly AI workloads. If that's what you're after, the RTX 5090 could be a perfect fit.

>The RTX 5090 is the sort of GPU that every gamer would love to have, but few can actually afford. If we're right and the AI industry starts picking up 5090 cards, prices could end up being even higher. Even if you have the spare change and can find one in stock (next week), it still feels like drivers and software could use a bit more time baking before they're fully ready.

>Due to time constraints, we haven't been able to fully test everything we want to look at with the RTX 5090. We'll be investigating the other areas in the coming days, and we'll update the text, charts, and the score as appropriate. For now, the score stands as it is until our tests are complete.

"Winning the lottery, Fire Dating match, and World Series of Boardgaming winner - UPDATE: Year 6 of being FIRE'd",financialindependence,1i846th,2025-01-23 09:10:18,262,0.82,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i846th/winning_the_lottery_fire_dating_match_and_world/,hungn3,,"This year had some amazingly lucky things happen to me: I was able to win a lottery, met a wonderful person on the Fire Dating website, and I ran a hot streak to become a World Series of Boardgaming winner. Read on to find out more!

**TL;DR:**

* 41/M SINK renting in the SF Bay Area, formerly in IT Consulting and FIRE'd in January 2019 with $1.10M
* Net worth in 2024 increased +$270K from $1.82M to $2.09M (1/1/12025)
* Spent $41,900 out of $40,080 budget (4.5% over) which is a 2.0% WR
* Spent 199 nights in 2024 away from home

# Finances

**Income**

* Dividends in Taxable Accounts: $18.3K
* Long Term Capital Gains: $2.2K
* IRA to Roth IRA conversion: $13.0K
* Total AGI: $33.5K

Now that I’m in my 6th year of retirement, my Roth IRA conversion ladder is now accessible and I have an average of \~$12K/year that I can pull out. This will be a very nice inflow of cash as it is becoming harder to find good lots in my taxable account that don’t have a ton of capital gains. Read below to see more about donating securities with capital gains as part of my future plan.

**Anticipated 2024Taxes**

* Federal: <$100
* State: <$400

**Expenses**

[2024 Planned Versus Actual Expenses for u\/hungn3](https://preview.redd.it/g9h74k3r3ree1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa47eef46e31f26431f4021de2c1a86bd9f1a5c)

EDIT 1: Apparently I messed up some of the calculations. Here is an updated expenses table: [https://imgur.com/a/e8DNtiX](https://imgur.com/a/e8DNtiX)

Expenses were mostly in line with budget and spending 4.5% more than planned and it was 6.3% more than 2023 spend.

Big(ger) Ticket Purchases

* Trad rack $500
* New Gaming PC $1500
* 4K OLED TV and Sound Bar $1800
* Havasupai permit $450
* Climbing trips $????

In addition to my cash spend, I also got some things without using cash:

* Got my PC with credit card points ($1500)
* Bought a new TV/soundbar  and paid for half ($900) with points.
* Used points for flights and hotels
* My mom paid for a cruise with her including some shore excursions ($2000).\*\*

\*\*I loaned my mom a total of $21K since 2016 for a variety of purposes and of course haven’t charged interest. Her paying for my cruise is her way of “paying me back” for the loan. I was curious to see how much it would have been if I invested the $21K in SP500 at the corresponding times that I loaned her money, and the $21K would be $56K today. I have zero regrets and would loan her the money again in a heartbeat.

**Withdrawal Rate, “Die with Zero”, and Gifting Stocks**

In 2024 I withdrew 2.0% of my net worth. This is also in-line with my 2023 withdrawal rate. Given that it is already a conservative withdrawal rate, and also isn’t accounting for any Social Security which should be \~$2K/month in 2024 dollars or any inheritance money that I will (almost certainly) get, my spending levels are overly conservative. Thinking about how much more impact I can have now, I’ve decided on a couple of things to help people/organizations that I love now, instead of waiting until I die:

**Finance actions for 2025 and going forward:**

* Increase withdrawal rate to 3.0% ($60K/year)
* Use some of that headroom to do more Roth IRA conversions and sell from my taxable account
* Help my sister pay down her house to improve her QOL for her family
* Donate $5K/year in securities to my queer summer camp\*
* Splurge on some “bigger” ticket items for myself

\*I learned that I can donate securities directly to a non profit without having to sell it first. They receive it with a reset tax basis and I don't have to pay capital gains, so it maximizes what I can donate. I currently have WAY too much in unrealized gains that I can't sell very effectively and stay within “optimal” ACA subsidy range, so this is a good way to donate to a cause I love now and have no tax impact. 

# My Retired Life

**Fire Dating Match**

I've matched a number of people on the Fire Dating website and met a few of them in person. One turned into a good friendship and there were a few others that fizzled out. But at the end of this year I met a wonderful person and we've just really been enjoying spending time together. We share a lot of similar values and being them around me brings me a lot of joy. They are currently a travel nurse and hoping to get to Coast Fire in the next 1-2 years and do nursing for 3-6 months a year and spend a significant portion of the rest of their time travelling and going on adventures. We've already got travel plans for 2025 including some backpacking adventures.

**Notable Outdoor Activities**

* Climbed 52 days outside on 175 routes over 216 pitches and 16,000+ feet
* Led 6 trad multi pitches climbs in Yosemite and Lover’s Leap
* Followed Corrugation Corner in Lovers Leap
* Backpacked a total of 16 days including 9 days on the Tahoe Rim Trail
* Took 5 friends to Catacombs Cave at Lava Beds National Monument

**Travel**

* Kalymnos Greece -  3 weeks.
* Adriatic cruise with mom - 2 weeks
* New Orleans for friend's 40th birthday - 1 week
* Red Rocks 2X - 3 weeks total
* Smith Rock - 1 week

**Favorite Media in 2024:**

* Movies: Challengers, National Anthem, The Wild Robot
* TV Shows: X-Men 97, Agatha All Along, Heartstopper
* Video Games: Against the Storm, Cobalt Core, Shogun Showdown
* Board Games: Spirit Island, Ark Nova, Ticket to Ride Legacy

# 2024 Goals and 2025 Plans

**2024 Goals:** 

* FAILED: Travel LESS: I’m hoping to spend at LEAST 180 days at home in 2024
* HALF SUCCESS: Train for and hike the John Muir Trail
* SUCCESS: Climb, backpack, and bike more
* FAILED: Eat healthier - do more home cooking, eat less junk/snack food
* SUCCESS: Travel to Kalymnos and climb for 3 weeks.

I was about 50% on my goals last year. We didn't get permits for the JMT, but we ended up doing 70 miles of the Tahoe Rim Trail.

**2025 Goals**

* Stay at home at least half the year
* Be more consistent about eating healthier and being more active
* Climb, backpack, and bike more
* Read books 1-5 of the Stormlight archive.
* Finish my Spirit Island Challenge - Win with every Spirit against every Level 6 Adversary - 2 Handed solo, avoiding both repeat spirit pairings and intentionally using OP combos

**Notable Planned Trips in 2025**

* US National Jigsaw Championship
* Trip to Brazil
* Various backpacking/camping/climbing trips
* International Climbing Trip in China or Laos

Thanks for reading all the way through and feel free to ask any question and I'll try to answer every one!

# FAQS:

**How is your rent so low?**

I have been both lucky and made conscious choices around tradeoffs. I’ve been in the same place since 2015 and have a 2BR APT outside of the city that I share with one roommate and I take the smaller bedroom. It’s perfectly serviceable, but certainly isn't a fancy new condo. Given how much I am away from home, I find it very hard to justify moving to a more expensive place when this place does the job.

For the “lucky” portion of it, the landlords have been very chill and have kept rents very stable the entire time I’ve been there. Additionally, California recently (2020) passed a state-wide rent control measure that protects all units over 15 years old.

It’s not officially rent control, but it stops landlords from making egregious increases. [The law limits increases to a maximum of 5%+inflation that year.](https://rentboard.berkeleyca.gov/laws-regulations/state-law/ab-1482-california-tenant-protection-act-2019)

**How do you travel so much on such a small budget?**

I do a lot of camping and outdoor activities where I can get campsites for $10-$20/night which can be split between a 2-4 people or get a backpacking permit for $10 and stay in the wilderness for however many days I'd like. I also stay with family and friends often which reduces costs.

I don't do a lot of ""credit card optimization"", but collect points where I can and compare cash versus point use and decide when to use which.

When I stay in hotels, I maximize hotel points where I can and try to have split costs by sharing rooms with friends. For example, when I was climbing in Greece, we stayed at an AirBNB type of place (via Booking.com) for $880 total between me and my friend for 18 nights it was only <$24/person/night.

**How are your health care costs so low?**

There is a lot to say here, but the quick summary is that if you can control your expenses and keep them low when you FIRE, you can leverage the ACA subsidies to benefit you a lot. I have chosen to go with a Silver 73 CSR plan which allows me to have very low premiums, low/no deductibles, and coverage that works for my needs. I am also lucky to be able-bodied, but also put effort into focusing on my health.

If I chose to have lower Roth IRA conversions or sell less stocks, I could have a Premium of $0, but I intentionally increased my MAGI, which led to \~$300 in premiums."

It was time to delete this game.,WarzoneMobile,1i7zhvj,2025-01-23 04:16:19,144,0.82,140,https://i.redd.it/4l17dtbmnpee1.jpeg,phillyymike,Discussion,"I see people in this thread talking about some they're having fun with this game still. I don't know how the game is optimized terribly I have a Samsung s23 Ultra I have a regular Samsung s23 I have a oneplus 9 5G. I have an LG V60 and it's terrible on all of those phones. it was fine before they updated it to this Black Ops 6 type of look.

But ever since then it's been unplayable not to mention you don't still don't have that many Maps this game is dead. Also a lot of people with low end devices can't play this game so you got to have a flagship device to even play it. 

Back the cod mobile I guess until Delta Force Mobile comes out but to me it seems like the FPS mobile genre is dying. You look what happened to Apex Legends mobile look how the devs destroyed farlight 84 Rainbow Six mobile still not out same thing with the division mobile you supposed to have a Apex Legend Rebrand game called high energy Heroes That was supposed to come out I haven't heard nothing about that. Combat Master had potential but ultimately was a fail blood strike seem like it had some promise but they don't add any new modes to that game. it's not really looking good for an FPS genre in Mobile gaming"
Looking for tips on what feats to take on my paladin.,DnD,1i7yei6,2025-01-23 02:51:18,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1i7yei6/looking_for_tips_on_what_feats_to_take_on_my/,Numerous-Air-1367,5th Edition,"So i have a oath of conquest (tho I probably should have been vengeance) paladin that I'm playing in a homegrown campaign. Currently he is lv 12 (no multiclass, yet). Currently I'm running him with the protection fighting style as a greatshielder (if you've seen Bofuri, think of Kuromu after he got the death looking shield). For reference the shield is very op with a +5AC. Currently my shield (which is arguably the main feature so far) has 3 notable abilities: 1. It has the shield master feat built in and 2. As an action I can transform my shield into a suit of armor. This replaced the first point of shield master with the ability to use 2h weapons. This also changes the ac to +3. And 3. I can summon a sword that does 4d6 dmg that will always hit unless i roll a nat 1 and critical if i roll higher then the enemy ac, not needing a nat 20. The ""sword"" has a 60ft range (yes you read that right), hits ALL enemies is range, and all dmg is doubled if the enemy is within 20ft. So potentially can get quadruple dmg.. I haven't taken any other feats as of yet. I'm not really familiar with what feats are ""optimal"". My paladin is chaotic evil with tartarus as his deity (my shield is called tartarus shield). My stats are as follows: 20 str 16dex 16con 11int 17wis 16cha (got very lucky with my rolls). I'm an ice dragonborn half elf with the folk hero/soldier background.

 Tldr of backstory being i was raised by my elf mother in a village protected by a benevolent dragon god (Vorkath, yes I stole the name from runescape). I was raised to protect the village and vorkath became the first God I followed. When I was a teenager my dragonborn warlord father came and slaughtered my village killing my mother in front of me. I spent the next 10 years building an army to face my father. Long story short I lost that war, losing almost all of my men. I found my way into an party of adventurers but unknown to me my father sent my brother (that I didn't know about) to find and kill me. In an act of rage and defiance I killed my own brother moment after he revealed he was my brother. It was at this time tartarus revealed himself to me. He offered my great power (ie the shield) if I swore loyalty to him.....I did more then that. I said if he guided me to victory I would offer my body as a vessel for him. So now I'm on a quest to avenge my mother, my village and my army and kill my father who has managed to wish himself into an ancient red shadow dragon. So ya. Looking for feats that would match this flavour so to speak.

Before saying anything yes I know the shield/weapon is op. The dm is setting our characters up to be the gods of the next campaign."
[Week 4] DOTA PMA: Actual Day 1 (Real),u_fungusplatypus,1i7xxbw,2025-01-23 02:14:22,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_fungusplatypus/comments/1i7xxbw/week_4_dota_pma_actual_day_1_real/,fungusplatypus,,"Currently, I am Divine 2 4,873 MMR. Since last post, I have played 19 games, 10 of which were ranked and 2 of which were INHOUSES. My most played hero was DISRUPTOR with 5 games. This is clearly within the game limits set at the start of the year, and due to purposeful effort to cut down on Dota along with starting a new job. Moreover, I may have been double counting Wednesdays during my counting previously, which would have increased each count by 2-3 games. 

Firstly, review on GENERATING A POSITIVE LANE STATE and GANKING. Huge progress after I switched to ranged catchers like Disruptor and Rubick!! I am able to trade efficiently in lane without losing too much health and stay healthy due to ALWAYS buying six tangoes. My benchmark is minute 3: Have I generated a significant advantage for my carry to the point that I will have time to roam at 4, 5, or 6 minutes? More on those timers later, but I have found that getting kills is not always a good thing. If we get a kill at 2:30, it is only good if the wave is pushed so that we can get lotus. Otherwise, it can be kinda bad because we have to play out the bounce while missing some resources AND being at lotus disadvantage. Maybe a good feeding opportunity for when I play Pos 4? My goal is to control wave and buy myself space for that by trading down efficiently so the enemy support has to concede jungle control to tango back up. If I can get my carry significant items on their second courier and give them a tango, I likely have a window at 3:40ish to run mid quickly (and grab bounty on the way, mostly been pos 5). I have been finding roam windows much more often since aiming for them, and am beginning to recognize that THIS is how all of those WoDota clips occur. 

Expansion on Optimal Roam Timings! Roaming for 4-minute water rune is pretty nice uncontested, because I can push the mid off of a rune (possibly huge) and attempt to deward one side! If enemy support walks with me to runes, I consider it countering the gank and it's whatever, tech skill and micro interactions are not worth reviewing beyond choosing to take them. If enemy pos 5 TPs mid, similar situation except their safelaner is much more vulnerable than mine because I still have TP. While all of these things are cool to consider, my optimal roam (besides killing mid) involves denying rune, dewarding, and throwing a nuke (thunder strike/fade bolt) on mid for chip damage. This is because the deward sets up a cool followup roam: at 5 minutes it will be night and unlikely for a ward to be put in the same spot unless sentry dewarded (minus 50 gold btw), and at 6 minutes there will be power rune. It adds one more action that the mid has to take to stabilize lane, which is a good thing to do. Managing my carry's lane AFTER my roam is a different art entirely, as I need to redo my initial advantage generation at a higher level and at night and after giving them lane control by 5:40 (and probably returning around 4:30). I think that at higher levels this will not be possible, but against lower level players or in extremely favorable matchups I think that this is a good way to push the pace of the game. This happened in my last Rubick game laning with Alch vs. Sky + WK-- I haven't reviewed it yet, I definitely fed a lot (but started game 3/0 which offset that), but did get some good mid roaming on and forced Pos 5 DB to TP for little value.

Real Talk: Disruptor jumpstarted this week's learning experience, as he is a simple hero with high impact. I feel like he has a clear role in the game, and as a hero only lacks nukes and mobility, which are small prices to pay for fantastic catch and fight control. Kinetic Fence in particular has been hugely OP and I feel like it is super slept on. I couldn't believe that my immortal coaches, randoms, and d2pt think Kinetic Fence sucks. Two charges is a COLOSSAL advantage: same duration scaling on Fence and Field = twice as much Kinetic Barrier with fence. Moreover, same CD (relatively low) = Second Fence is FREE. Lastly, fence is pretty big! People probably think fence is bad because ""you can just walk around it"". Please play one game with or against Kinetic Fence and you will realize that this is perhaps the single most incorrect criticism you could ever make about any hero in Dota 2. Kinetic Fence is large enough to block off ALL STAIRWAYS in the game (At level 1 btw). Moreover, people who are trying to run away from a gank normally only have one direction to go (eg. back to the tower). Trying to ""go around"" the fence = eat a stun and die. Even in Static Storm-- which in my opinion, you really only need to land long enough for team to go in, and the rest of the duration is area denial-- you have two Kinetic Fences to play with. If someone is trying to escape an Ursa, they are not getting away from the acute angle. LASTLY, for people who say BKB is a counter to Kinetic Fence, BKB counters everything Disruptor does anyways so I don't think it matters too much. And in my experience, that second charge comes in so huge late game if you can stay alive in fights. The ability can have basically permanent uptime, and comes up in 0.4 seconds rather than 1.0 on field. 

tl;dr, Kinetic Fence really good and people are sleeping on it.

In terms of outside forces on my gameplay, I have been in the midst of starting my challenge of reading 100 books by the end of the year. Moreover, I have proudly not been starting by ""planning"". Instead, I have been slowly reading whatever is in front of me. Today's Good Ideas will become tomorrow's Bad Ideas, so it is better to cash out on what I want to do rather than ""wait for when I'm ready"". This has crippled me for my entire life musically, so I am simply diving in on both reading and improving in Dota 2. It has been a little slow going, but it is made easier by not having much to look forward to-- if I finish a book, I can go look for a new one. If I find a book I really want to read, I will just read it and push the books I am in the middle of to the side temporarily. It is a messy way to live, but it is a way that eventually reads 100 books. All of my other methods died out due to thinking bloat. All of this reading should hopefully improve my critical thinking skills (to outplay noobs in Dota) and writing abilities (to trash talk more effectively).

Lastly, as a note that I have been wanting to put into these journal entries since Day 0 (so much or not planning!), I have been listening to Dota Music Packs while playing because they are cheap and fun and show up in Candyworks. My favorite is a tie between JJ Lin and Nemestice, but all of them are pretty good and having them all on shuffle is a good way to keep the game fresh for me. Out of game, I have been looping classics from Alien Stage, inabakumori, and Breaking Benjamin. I think that I am overdue for a music library review, but that is probably not going to improve my Dota performance much at this point. While Divine is still not Immortal, I think that 4.7k-ish MMR is high enough that thinking about the game can be more productive than simply slam-queueing constantly.

My goal for next week is to continue refining my ROAM TIMINGS. I think that GENERATING POSITIVE LANE STATES is a no-brainer at this point, but I will not get rid of it as a goal until I have been doing it consistently and will consider removing it at Week 10 Entry (or if I hit Immortal before then, extremely unlikely). I also want to work on DEFENDING VISION and making MID-GAME MOVES. In winning or losing states, letting game stall out is incredibly boring and not the correct play even if it benefits my team comp. I think that similar to SC2 and WC3, I have to play for info and to waste opponent's time-- blocking a camp, baiting a reaction, and making small moves for small advantages like vision or just plain area control can create opportunities for opponents to mess up... which is what the game is all about in Immortal. When people do not make unforced errors, I think it's important to ""force"" some errors and at least try to punish them so that I can learn if it doesn't work out. Expected value and all that."

2D Lights - An Honest Review and Performance Guide after Shipping a Game,Unity3D,1i7uo0d,2025-01-22 22:49:37,6,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1i7uo0d/2d_lights_an_honest_review_and_performance_guide/,coldlahmen,Resources/Tutorial,"https://preview.redd.it/3zlape56znee1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea9eb85a80623eeacd12ca26629e024f918e36a0

Hey all - as a lot of you must know at this point, Unity made a 2D Lights package, which eventually became part of the URP package.  
  
I recently shipped a game - [Dad's Coming](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527350/Dads_Coming/) \- using the feature. When we started development on it, the package was still a preview, so we got to see a lot of the updates to it.

I'm going straight into it: Looks beautiful. Performance is horrendous.

The game is a local co-op about two siblings tidying up the house by throwing objects around to place them in their ""correct"" position before time runs out and dad arrives. Some objects can break, there's a cat who knocks things over, but overall there isn't a lot of heavy simulation - it should be really light on the CPU.

Before optimizing - over 90% of all CPU time was for rendering lights and shadows. We were doing some tests on switch and it barely got to 20 fps in some stages.

So here are some of my tips on how to make use of it:

# Minimize lights with shadows enabled

* Only enable shadows on lights that need it

Lights with shadows disabled are really lightweight. Lights with shadows are not, even if they are not actually hitting any shadow casters in the scene. Only enable shadows on lights where it matters.

This is the most significant thing you can do to improve performance. I cannot stress this enough.

In this example, there is only 1 light with shadows enabled.

[Only the top left light has shadows enabled](https://preview.redd.it/zw6i4gziznee1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e22a36a567c19f2aca2b5773c74f5d5ade8fa16)

# Minimize and group target sorting layers

1. Make lights only hit the sorting layers that actually matter
2. Group together the sorting layers that will be targeted (they need to be adjacent)
3. Multiple lights with the same set of adjacent sorting layers are optimized by Unity

For every light, you can set the target sorting layers that they'll affect. The less, the better. 

And if you have multiple lights that target the same group of sorting layers, Unity will optimize and batch those calculations as well. But that will only happen if the sorting layers are adjacent!

[Only two sorting layers and their adjacent](https://preview.redd.it/n49jk34pznee1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dbdc4cfca4a522a8c8e9dbd6b38b0cceddff2a4)

# Minimize shadow casters

* Minimize the amount of shadow casters in a scene

Same principle - only have shadow casters where it actually matters, and if you can find a way to ""merge"" shadow casters, do it. In some extreme cases in Dad's Coming, this was the end result:

[Yes. This is only 1 shadow caster.](https://preview.redd.it/1j5r10ysznee1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c7d4002574f6408a3a2a82d1acc267bfb0dd59f)

There's a composite shadow caster component that should merge shadow casters, but in our experience it did not work. However it might have been fixed.

# Other tips:

* Intensity 0 lights still do light calculations. Disable the Light 2D component when that's the case.
* Disable lights that aren't affecting anything visible/are too far.
* Only enable normal maps if/where needed. 
* Gamma color space looks horrible for 2D Lights. (Project Settings->Player->Other Settings). However, it does have better performance.
* Try messing with the Renderer 2D Data options for Light Render Textures if you're on mobile. (haven't tested myself, Dad's Coming is a desktop game)

That's it. I hope this is useful to anyone struggling with performance with 2d lights. Also, check out Dad's Coming if you're interested. Feel free to ask any questions on 2d lights and I'll answer them if I can."
Epi On CXL Jan 2025,Keratoconus,1i7rvlv,2025-01-22 20:27:48,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keratoconus/comments/1i7rvlv/epi_on_cxl_jan_2025/,ModernMixologist,Crosslinking,"I was diagnosed in something like 2009 (age 26). Had some progression initially but then seemed to stabilize around 2014 or so and didn’t have anyone local-ish doing CXL so I didn’t. I have decently advanced Keratoconus but still correct well with hybrid RGPs I’ve worn for 10+ years. Had some slight worsening the last year or so so decided to pursue Epi-On (I’m a physician/surgeon) so vision is kinda important to my job.

Underwent epi-on this week. Did both eyes at once to minimize time off work. 

The procedure:
Intake and full exam in morning.
Eyes numbed and corneas wiped with small swabs to clear mucous and “rough up” corneas pre procedure to optimize riboflavin uptake. There was no discomfort with that at all.

Taken to the office procedure room. Had some music going and low light. Numbed eyes again. Pilocarpine drop a to construct pupils.
Eye speculum placed and ring shaped sponge placed on cornea (could see through center). 
Drops, drops, drops. Riboflavin every 2 min and intermittent numbing drops. After 10 minutes everything removed to go to other room for slit lamp exam to check saturation. Repeat. 
Each eye took two 10 minutes sessions. 

Once saturation adequate, numbed eyes and eye speculum placed in again, UV light was applied on/off for 10-15 seconds at a time for like 20-30 min.  Numbing drops and riboflavin throughout the treatment. 

Repeated whole process with other eye.

Slit lamp exam after to check for any corneal abrasions. 

Sent home with Percocet,  numbing drops, moxifloxacin drops, and steroid drops. 

I arrived at 8am and left at 1130am.

After procedure:
Pain probably 4/10. Not terrible but not fun. Very light sensitive (like wear sunglasses in a dark room sensitive). I don’t think Percocet did much for the pain…just made me sleepy. Numbing drops gave about 20 min of good relief and then started to wear off. I’d go lay down in a dark room when they wore off. The tearing is what surprised me most. Just wouldn’t stop. This lasted pretty much til evening time and then started to get better. Had some difficulty sleeping but eventually drifted off.

 Post op day 1 (today):
Eye pain almost totally gone. Didn’t even bother with pain meds or numbing drops. 
Had early AM follow up for slit lamp exam with fluroscein to check for corneal abrasions again. No issues. In and out in 20 min. 
Still very light sensitive in the morning. Had an hour drive home and wore sunglasses, eye mask, and wife’s scarf on my face.
Continuing the 4x daily antibiotic and steroid drops for 7 days. 
Light sensitivity faded by late afternoon and could take off my sunglasses indoors in a dim room and has continued to improve into the evening. 
Vision seems just barely blurrier than my baseline with my contacts out. "

Very bad performance in Lightroom Classic,Lightroom,1i7hpfb,2025-01-22 13:14:20,0,0.5,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lightroom/comments/1i7hpfb/very_bad_performance_in_lightroom_classic/,awpeeze,Discussion,"Copy pasting from my thread in the Adobe forums that no one saw :(

So I've checked several threads and I couldn't find any fix for my issue, it's really bugging me because I just can't use Lightroom (Cloud), I hate it.   
  
Basically, the program runs like ass, the menus are slow, going from Library to Develop takes a whole 10 seconds (which may not seem like a lot but it's a very noticeable delay), every time I switch photos it takes like 3 seconds, and every time I flag a photo (rejected for example), it takes like 4 seconds.  
  
I already tried \*everything\*, I configured the program for full GPU usage, I run the program with high process priority, I purged the camera raw cache and gave it a bigger size (even though I don't use Camera Raw or photoshop), I optimized the catalog, and I even reinstalled the program.  
  
Nothing gets rid of these performance issues, and the icing on the cake is that my Laptop (An Asus VivoBook) does \*not\* have these issues.  
  
These are my Specs:  
  
Ryzen 9 3900X  
RTX 4070 Ti Super 16GB  
32GB of DDR4 RAM  
1TB NVMe for the OS (and where Lightroom Classic installed)

1TB NVMe for Photo catalog, preset info and more.

I also tried:

* Putting the Catalog \*everywhere\* but the OS NVMe, including an empty secondary NVMe, a Hard Drive, and a SATA SSD. 
* I tried 1:1 previews
* I tried Purging the catalog cache
* I made sure that the catalog (or the Adobe Lightroom folder in Pictures) is not in OneDrive or synchronizing to it.
* Reinstalled the program on a fresh windows install

  
Here's the system info from Lightroom itself:

Just cleared 32 fear on all aspects on both underworld and surface. Surface is soooooooooooo much more annoying than underworld. Holy shit the automatons that shot lasers are so cancer, and sappers shot their grenades from across the screen so fast that you cannot possibly dodge and just have to eat 25x2 and move on. It is ridiculous. But I am glad I cleared it before they nerf Olympus. Rest of my post is about my surface runs since underworld is so much easier in comparison.

I used this set of vows for pretty much all aspects. Except maybe my first clear whenI used hubris and wards with melinoe coat. Probably not optimal for every aspect, but I am comfortable with this setup as It doesn't really limit the playstyle of any weapon.

https://preview.redd.it/xsjbon6dlkee1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d6cb5b44f989b670fd829eec53b9efe58970da7

For keepsakes, I ALWAYS started with demeter keepsake then athena then mostly pin (sometimes evil eye or fig leaf). Always. No matter the aspect or the weapon. I would grab demeter cast without rarifying it, and then pick whatever god suits my weapon in ephyra and fill some slots and then pick another demeter door to go for cold storage and rarify that. If you are lucky and endup with a heroic cold storage, you will get 7second freeze on a 10s CD that can be extended with poms. This effectively neuters frenzy II and makes enemies frozen for an insanely long time allowing me to just smash buttons for the win. Even bosses are so slow while frozen that you can actually dodge some of Prometheus attacks 🤯🤯

Unless I am incredibly unlucky, I have this before the cyclop. Gods that I really like beside Demeter are Hephaestus for tankiness (trusty shield is op op but deeper in the run i started to appreciate uncanny fortitude more) and hera for hitch and born gain if I am using magick. aphro is also really good for shameless attitude and more tankiness. apollo can work if you get back burner but otherwise I felt his damage is lacking. zeus is good but he has no defense and really shines when you have like 5 zeus boons which makes him difficult to use but he has romantic spark for the carry. unless the aspect really calls for it, I am not taking poseiden, or hestia (water fitness is nuts tho, If I still have spots lefts by olympus, I prefer to fill it with poseiden for it, especially since demeter has a lot of water boons).

Final notes, I like to take one big health door from ephyra and once the build is going I pick health over pretty much anything except my second hammer. Always take mental block, and save some rolls for it, it is so much better than divine dash. Medea buffs need some love, they are so weak that I hardly bother with her anymore.

Victory screens for each aspect and some thoughts!

**Axe**

Builds [here](https://imgur.com/a/HV4mGiT). For the axe, omega attacks are very punishing on 32 fear imo. for both melinoe and thanatos, I never used them. rapid slash is my favorite hammer for these two aspects. For charon, surprise surprise, I recommend demeter cast, to keep mobs steady while you charge your ridiculously long omega special. I tried other casts but you don't feel as safe without it.

**Blades**

Nothing special here. Pan is still op. for artemis, I tried to incorporate the ripostle. but it is encourages slow game play, so just took advantage of faster omega attacks to pretty much spam them ignoring the riposte.

**Coat**

Nothing to say here really. weapon is very strong. special is garbage tho. probably need to be reworked imo. maybe it's just me but it feels clunky and takes forever to deal any damage.

**Skull**

very enjoyable weapon. all aspect play differently and all very strong. i know persephone can be unwieldy. but it served me well. I played to the weapon and the run was very smooth. It really wants the hammer that returns the special waves back to you tho.

**Staff**

my worst weapon tbh. they all play similar to each other. and all want you to spam omegas at some points which can be risky on high fear. I build depending on the first hammer i get, but special is far strong than attack imo.

**Torch**

all aspects feel very good. but I just wanna touch on triple comet. Imo it is the best hammer for this weapon and it is not even close. it dishes out so much damage and makes special spam very viable. I pretty much take it on any aspect if it is offered.

Baal - OP or just unfun?,EvilDeadTheGame,1i7fg0a,2025-01-22 11:43:04,5,0.67,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilDeadTheGame/comments/1i7fg0a/baal_op_or_just_unfun/,Circadian6,Discussion,"I've been meaning to write this post for a couple of days.  Overall, I don't think Baal is OP.  He's absolutely garbage at the book and as long as you have a competent team, you win most games you make it to the book.  However, this doesn't mean these are fun games.  Here are a few of my criticisms regarding his design *(not criticizing the players that play as him)* and why I don't find Baal compelling to play against.  

First, and this is a big one, every loss against Baal plays out the same way.  Basic unit possession spam.  You defeat one and immediately fight the next one.  Then you defeat that one and then immediately fight the next one.  Then you defeat that one and immediately fight the next one.  Since you have to walk from objective to objective against good players that destroy cars, the game boils down to how many Shemps have you acquired before the demon finds you.

Second, Baal's toolkit auto plays some aspects of the game. If a survivor sets off a trap, which they will, they will snowball into setting off surrounding traps due to being marked.  Good survivors know to wait out the mark timer before moving around that map.  In some cases, they may even maneuver to areas of the map that are less likely to have traps.  However,  spots of the map have trap density that you can't avoid, particularly at objectives.  I've had some recent games where the trap was literally on the activation of the dagger.  Game knowledge and skill are irrelevant at this point.  I've had several matches where you get punished for playing the game due to how traps points spawned.  You swing a weapon and it drives you into a traps.  There is no player engagement from Baal.  This is just a thing that happens for him.

Third, managing fear is irrelevant.  At a certain point of the game, fear rises so fast that it almost completely negates any meaningful acts to manage it.  You may choose to have a character with an anti-fear build, but your build is meaningless.  Ruby and to a certain degree Leader Ash, are the only characters that can contest the fear gain that Baal generates.  Generally, I don't hate that there are demons that can pressure survivors into managing their fear.  I think this is a positive aspect of the game.  However, I'm not a fan of removing the motivation to do so because it's pointless.

Fourth, Baal absolutely destroys less experienced players, making experience farming extremely easy.  Players load into a match, get possess looped, go down, then DC.  SO many matches against Baal end up being a 3v1 or 2v1.  This point isn't to say that an experienced demon doesn't always have an advantage over newer players.  It is to say that the snowball effect is so lopsided that the fresh player experience is over before they have a chance to understand what happened and why.

Lastly, Baal sucks at the book.  This drives survivor behavior into a dash to the book.  Gathering resources is simply not that important.  Exploring for Pink isn't a priority.  You simply grab what is MOST convenient and rush to objectives.  If you are lucky, the gods have blessed you with a car that the demon hasn't destroyed and race to the end of the match.  This level of optimized strategy isn't fun, which is why most players in the community ignore this tactic.  

I have a few thoughts on Baal and what I would try to do to make him a more interesting demon to play as and against.  These ideas wouldn't please players that enjoy his current design. Perhaps I'll share some of those thoughts in another post.  Anyway, good luck to you all and I wish you the best."

We welcome all players who want to theorize and discuss the game at a high level with an emphasis on winning and a competitive edge. If you have a theorycrafted strategy to share or have a question about higher level League of Legends you're in the right place.

What's a metagame? For the purpose of this forum the 'metagame' is made up of what choices we expect to be made in a game based on our experiences in previous games. In solo queue, the champions that are perceived as strongest tend to be chosen more often and it is those champions, how they are played and optimized, and how they are used strategically that shape the metagame.

Rules:

When presenting an idea, your post should be:

|    On-Topic - Theorycrafting and Strategy is what we are here for!

|    Substantial - No low effort posts. Be as complete and in-depth as possible. The body of each submitted post requires 150 characters.

|    Justified - Your idea should explain why your choices are plausible in a competitive environment. Support your theorycrafting with math proofs, match histories, or strategic analysis. In order for an controversial idea to be plausible it must be supported with evidence.

When asking a question, your post should be:

|    On-Topic - Theorycrafting and Strategy to help you make choices.

|    Specific - General questions lead to general answers which promote lazy thinking.

List of naughty things bad posts do that get your post removed

|    Is X viable? - In solo queue everything is viable. We care about what is competitive in a given metagame. Competitive means that a strategy has a reliable, distinct, value that can contribute meaningfully to winning games.

|    What's the state of X? - Be specific. Questions like these just generate opinion polls and not enough discussion that drives choices.

|    Tell me how to build/What is the best build/How do I X/Give me tips? - We aren't all experts here, but many experts put their expertise online in guides and forums. We want to avoid posts that end up linking you to recipes and stick to the meatier end of discussion.

"The need for an online space for Mongolians, an Only Mongolians if you will.",mongolia,1i783im,2025-01-22 05:23:00,54,0.97,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/mongolia/comments/1i783im/the_need_for_an_online_space_for_mongolians_an/,Dumplingconquest,,"To me, the early 2000s were the Golden Age of the internet. The iPhone and Android hadn’t come out yet, and most people used computers to go online. The internet had a sense of joy and discovery back then—you really had to dig through multiple websites to find interesting stuff, and your efforts were rewarded. Now, it feels like the entire internet has been streamlined into a handful of behemoths where most people spend almost all their time. It’s heavily censored, the content is highly curated, and an ever-optimized AI algorithm pretty much spoon-feeds everyone mind-numbing content.

It was around this time that internet usage also started to explode in Mongolia. Back then, there were many experiments with people building websites and products. We used to have a website for Mongolians in Korea called **MGLChat** and a chatroom for Mongolians in Europe called **Mongolei**. Then there were other experimental websites, like a warez site called **hantulga.com**, a totally inappropriate and probably illegal site called **pizdaa.com**, a photo-sharing site called **Suuder**, and much more. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons that I won’t get into (because this post is already becoming a rambling tirade), all these sites have been pretty much killed off by the internet’s big behemoths. This left Mongolians without their own online space.

Today, Mongolians online are largely divided into the evil trinity of:

1. **Facebook**, with its ""hatred will get you more engagement"" algorithm, where boomers and Gen Xers rage.
2. **Instagram**, with its ""scantily clad girls living their best life will make you depressed"" algorithm, where my cohort of millennials congregate.
3. **TikTok**, with its ""if your brain is turned to mush, you won’t feel any pain"" algorithm, where Gen Z tunes out of all the world’s problems.

Among the slow death of Mongolian online spaces, the hardest loss was undoubtedly **Asuult Sambar**, a Mongolian phpBB forum that was once the most popular Mongolian website. It was a place for Mongolians living abroad to find each other, as well as keep in touch with friends back home and across the world. And just like **r/Mongolia**, it was pretty unhinged. Ever since Asuult went away, a void has been left for such a public platform for Mongolians.

**r/Mongolia** fills part of this void; however, it is mostly limited to Mongolians who speak English. Furthermore, every imaginable topic being posted in a single subreddit, while entertaining, fails to address the real issues that the OP is dealing with, making it less informative or educational. We often see political and economic posts mixed with jokes and shitposts, which dampens the sincerity the poster may have initially felt. Additionally, about 50% of the subreddit consists of foreigners. While their intentions seem good, they are not the best source for advice on uniquely Mongolian issues faced by teenagers or others in the community.

This is why we have decided to recreate a Mongolian space online—to once again foster the communal spirit that used to exist on Asuult, but with the technical advantages of a forum like Reddit. It is my hope that the well-educated, English-speaking Mongolians on Reddit will become the first users of the site, setting the culture, tone, and civility of the discussions. I hope the forum becomes a place where those privileged enough to learn English and live abroad can teach and guide those less privileged by providing them with accurate and reliable information, in Mongolian.

For foreigners—unless you want to learn Mongolian, I doubt you’ll find the site interesting. But if you are interested in learning Mongolian, there will be plenty of memes and stuff all in Mongolian. If you can understand Mongolian jokes, that would mean you are well on your way towards becoming a true orc. To complete your transition, you would just need to learn how to swear and probably buy a Prius. 

For any Mongolian Reddit users active on **r/Mongolia**, if you want to become a moderator of any of the ""Bulans"" on the site, feel free to DM me on Reddit with the name of the sub you want to moderate, as well as the username of the account you create. We will give all Mongolian reddit users free reign on the site.

Singularity Finance Aiming to Bring AI Economy On-Chain One dApp At a Time,defi,1i72mks,2025-01-21 23:08:52,80,0.96,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1i72mks/singularity_finance_aiming_to_bring_ai_economy/,MediocreUnit2203,:discuss: Discussion,"
Explore how Singularity Finance is revolutionizing DeFi by bringing AI on-chain with innovative dApps and its incentivized testnet.


To say there is a lot of innovative stuff happening at the intersection of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance would be an understatement of epic proportions. Indeed, the evolution of DeFAI (or AiFi, if you prefer) has been one of the hottest trends in web3 for a while now, with autonomous AI agents increasingly deployed to conduct trades, audit smart contracts, analyze markets, and much more.

While there is a long list of projects striving to bring the AI economy on-chain, one in particular deserves special mention: Singularity Finance. An EVM-compatible Layer-2 blockchain designed specifically to support AI-powered financial services, it came about as the consequence of a merger between decentralized portfolio management venture SingularityDAO and Cogito Finance, a project specializing in RWAs.

Having recently launched its first incentivized testnet ahead of a scheduled mainnet release in 2025, now is a good time to learn more about the project’s bonafides and vision.

From DeFi to DeFAI
Bringing AI capabilities to the realm of blockchain, and in particular DeFi, is a tantalizing prospect – and one that has already been put into action: the AI agent market, as defined by the value of the platform’s native tokens, is now worth a cool 16.3 billion and rising fast. And there are plenty of use-cases yet to be explored.

What Singularity Finance represents, then, is a gateway to the world of DeFAI for businesses, institutions, and retail users; a venue where they can cut their teeth on the new frontier of DeFi, safe in the knowledge that AI capabilities have been brought on-chain in a transparent and accessible way.



Built on the open-source OP Stack to ensure full compatibility with Ethereum, the AI-optimized Layer-2 furnishes developers with familiar tools while leveraging the PoS chain’s security and extensive builder community. But don’t take that at face value: the aforementioned testnet is a great opportunity to find out exactly what the network has to offer.

Having started on December 30, and set to run for three months, the incentivized testnet allows the Singularity team to evaluate the network’s scalability and security while giving the community valuable hands-on experience with future mainnet features. Participants can engage in all manner of activities, from conducting transactions on testnet dApps (staking, bridging, etc) to testing wallet features, identifying bugs, writing tutorials, completing social tasks, and so on.

Naturally, rewards are the main ‘carrot’ in this scenario: the testnet favors a gamified reward system, with a leaderboard tracking user engagement and dispensing rewards accordingly. Integration with MetaMask, meanwhile, provides a familiar entry-point for users and enables seamless testing of transactions and token management, among other benefits.

For those interested in putting the network through its paces, test tokens are distributed daily and can be requested at https://faucet-testnet.singularityfinance.ai/. The testnet block explorer, meanwhile, is accessible through https://explorer-testnet.singularityfinance.ai. Ultimately, the testnet serves as a platform to attract and educate people/protocols about the benefits the network has to offer.

Needless to say, the soon-to-be listed Singularity Finance’s native token (SFI) serves as the project’s backbone, functioning similarly to ETH on Ethereum for gas fees while also playing economic and governance roles. The token supply will accommodate both existing token-holders from the merger and future development needs, with a clear conversion ratio for SDAO and CGV owners based on a daily moving price average.

When Will Mainnet Launch?
With a mainnet launch expected to closely follow the testnet in Q2, Singularity Finance is gearing up to support a broad swathe of real-world applications and cement itself as a pillar of the burgeoning AiFi sector. Among the Layer-2’s most notable planned features are Optimistic Rollup infrastructure, Account Abstraction, SFI vaults, oracles, and bridges, with the chain itself very much in the high-scalability, low-cost bracket.

Ultimately, Singularity Finance hopes to create an irresistible environment for web3 developers looking to innovate in DeFAI, and for users intent on seizing yield-bearing opportunities. The platform’s steadfast commitment to ecosystem development is evidenced by its new grant program, an initiative that supports builders who contribute to the network’s growth.

Whether the DeFAI sector leads to the creation and popularization of more efficient, accessible, and sophisticated financial services remains to be seen. But there’s no denying the trend’s momentum, or the ambition of cutting-edge platforms like Singularity Finance to positively shape its future."
Hot take - Loot boxes were not the problem.,Robocraft,1i71rj6,2025-01-21 22:27:11,33,0.85,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Robocraft/comments/1i71rj6/hot_take_loot_boxes_were_not_the_problem/,Killacreeper,,"(taking this from the replies elsewhere)
Gonna be real for y'all - I played robocraft for easily hundreds to thousands of hours.

Almost all of that - if not all of it - was after lootbox implementation.

This could be me having been a child talking, but I LOVED that game, even with lootboxes. Hell, they could have been an attracting factor. But the base gameplay was still awesome, and I seriously enjoyed the mechanics of fighting with different bots, different strategies, team comps, build styles, etc.

The different types of mobility, everything, awesome. And this comes from someone who sucked at building, didn't have premium, didn't have money for crates, etc.

I firmly believe that lootboxes weren't the bullet that killed robocraft, they were just the thing that made people mad.

(TO BE CLEAR, I AM NOT CLAIMING THEY WERE GOOD. THEY WERE NOT. BUT THEY DID NOT SINGLEHANDEDLY SINK FREEJAM)

They could have been PART of the death, but we are now nearly a DECADE after their implementation. If they were that abysmal, this game would have gone the way of concord in a year max.

I'm not fully clued in on any of the behind the scenes, the decisions made, I just played alone for years. No community, no discord, no nothing - with an untainted view. Some stuff annoyed me at times, like the meta bots and clans playing in stacks just making games unwinnable, but the game itself was never not fun to me.

-

I think the actual issue is - like with many services in recent years - many many games and social platforms, websites, etc. were made in the 2000s/2010s without a real profit line in play yet.

Tons of studios and companies got tons of investment because tech and gaming was new, and therefore growth was potentially insane, etc. - that's how you have companies like Twitter or Reddit (or even YouTube) that are HUGE but make little to no profit or are even consistently super far in the red.

The question is largely - how do you monetize robocraft in a good way? And I think the answer isn't something that the company and the player base would both like - especially before gatcha games and $20-$40 skins were considered the norm.

The game is f2p - making it paid retroactively would tank player numbers, make less people try it for the first time, and less existing players stay.

Adding lootboxes? Obvious.

Subscription model? - same as the above issues.
If the subscription is to play, same as making game paid. If the subscription model is for rewards in game? Then the rewards have to be ""worth it"" - and if there is no functional advantage to them, for most players, it wouldn't be worth paying.

Even during the full lootbox era, I never paid anything and still had an amazing time.

Optimistically this means the game was still fun without investment.

Neutrally, I was a kid with free time, and I wasn't really aware of what I may be missing.

Pessimistically, it's because I wasn't as radicalized against microtransactions yet (fuck em)

Cosmetics? I mean, maybe, but they did try that, the marketplace existed, y'know, whatever. For most people in the audience, the cosmetics weren't a NEED anyway. 

---

There are dozens of examples of monetization models that wouldn't really fit robocraft very well - and ways it could have gotten arguably way worse (imagine a battle pass where new weapons were introduced in the pass and you couldn't get them without grinding all the way to the end which would take like a month or two, and everyone else got them on t1, they were super op, and if you didn't finish the pass you just never got them)

I think that beyond any single Boogeyman the community has pointed to (pilot seats, lootboxes, and physics changes are ones I see a lot) -
Robocraft was just a game from a better time that wasn't made to thrive in this world's gaming climate.

Realistically, the playerbase shrunk not because of crates, but because robocraft really wasn't capitalizing on FOMO nearly as hard as most other games, wasn't dropping content constantly, making big meta shifts or wacky seasons, etc.

It wasn't super profitable and it wasn't optimized to hold the attention of random passers-by.

The game was mainly fun for us - the tinkering autists, the obsessive autists! The bots have meaning because we refused to get bored. And as we ride to certain death(okay I'll stop now)

Point is, a game for a niche audience without a TON of incentive to pay is a game living on borrowed time - and frankly it amazes me that robocraft lived as long as it did.

As an example...

I played robocraft, worlds adrift, trove, and later Fortnite.
Despite enjoying the others more, Fortnite was the one with timers on everything, daily challenges, cosmetic rewards, fomo, seasons, an insane profit model, etc.

So eventually, it's what I spent a lot of my time on. And every other game copied that strategy.

With this, that will be 2/3 of my childhood games dead.

It greatly upsets me that games like robocraft are impossible to play alone, or to host your own servers. I'm a tinkerer, I'd host a server in a heartbeat. But it's gonna be gone.

I'm not saying the devs were good or perfect - all I'm saying is, we need to face the reality.

There was no silver bullet that killed robocraft, and just adding pilot seats back wouldn't suddenly revive it.

It died because it was placed into the natural selection pit that is modern gaming and the fomo acclimatization of gamers.

The game didn't stop being fun - most of us just lost interest with time, especially the general playerbase who knew NOTHING of lootboxes or what came before etc.

It's sad.
But that's modern gaming."

I'm a 17E in currently in AIT, im fresh out of high school. I have airborne on contract. I was also offered to volunteer for RASP and go to regimen, but I don't know how that will work out career wise. Being in AIT, I'm not sure if this army shit is what I want to do with my life. I know from being around signal guys my whole life that regimen can fuck your career path in 25 series, is it the same with 17E? How it was described to me, it can boost it but that was also the Ranger Liason so there might be some bias. 

Looking for any input from people who have done this longer, not asking for 17E specificly or just Rangers. Just needs some advice before I make this career change.

Planning on going 17E option 40 as I was told by friends and family in the military that it's the best balance between learning a useful skill and still getting to do ""cool guy sh\*t"". What do 17E's do in the army and if I make it to regiment will I be able to kick in doors with infantry or will I just be sitting in an office?

Couple questions in regards to a reclass. Currently an 11B seeking to reclass to a 35N. Meet all qualification criteria, ASVAB etc. The career counselor that I’m working with has said that I have submitted all the necessary ppwk, and after HRC has received it I have been told that #1 the class date must be minimum 1 year out, and #2 there are no available class dates, and classes will only become available when enough people sign up for it. I am currently undergoing the security clearance process that’s required for the MOS with possibly another month or two before adjudication. This leaves me at a standstill, with time on my contract burning away and no news if I’ll even be able to make this work. I might possibly have to wait on promotion or training opportunities as a result, and don’t know if it’s worth it to wait. 
I’ve heard the National Guard offers full time positions under this MOS, and Im in contact with both a unit and recruiter who would be willing to work with me, however I understand the whole recruiting shtick and would like some third party information. My wife is really pushing for me to go NG I just want to hear both sides, and nobody I work with or associate with has any experience with 35N’s. I would appreciate it if someone were to shed a little light on the following questions. 

Question #1 Does anyone know how frequently the AIT classes for this MOS are scheduled, and if there’s anything on my part I can do to better secure a position when one becomes available?
Question #2 Is it worth it to hold out for an active duty class and job, or should I just ETS and go with the national guard? Maybe someone who has experience with one of the above can let me know how their experience was? 
Question #3 could I contact someone from the community I could ask further questions regarding the admin side of things? I understand this a nuanced situation and a lot of details that go unexplained on a post. 

Appreciate all the help, I’ll take a mango loco monster and two ranchero rollerbites.

Looking into the army. Got an undergraduate degree in Chinese Language and Literature (can read more than 2500 words and both traditional and simplified script). I work in data center deployment.               

Situation: Been looking online recently at cybersecurity jobs. Many require an active security clearance, some with polygraph and some without.                 

Goal: In addition to the certifications I hope to earn in the next few years (OCSP, Cisco CyberOps Professional Certification, CompTIA Linux+, and CASP+), I got a Network+ and Security+, and I'm studying for a CySA+ as we speak. I might even be tempted to get a master's degree in Cybersecurity later on.               

Before I get my hopes too high and pull the trigger on a four year contract, it would be a good idea to ask these questions:               
1. I need to know what kind of questions they will ask on the polygraph exam. As an example, I knew a guy who looked enough like his cousin that (before he was 21) he was able to borrow or steal his cousin's ID, get into a club, then got arrested for something and used his cousin's ID as the ID they documented him with at the precinct. This guy also told me he engaged in sexually deviant behavior in America (call girls). Got got a secret background (but not TS as far as I know) clearance.                
2. I spent a literal decade of my adult working life outside of America. I need to get caught up on my taxes. I made a considerable amount in capital gains. Is this going to be an issue anywhere along the way with my prospective career path?                 
3. My wife is not American. We applied for her green card. Is this going to be an issue with an active secret / top secret background clearance?              
4. What MOS would you guys recommend? I did look in to 17C, but I am doubtful that I would get into that MOS as it requires a TSI with a polygraph.                 
5. With the certifications that I listed above, would it be a good idea to earn some of these before I enter the army? I have a few months of free time on my hands and I study hard.               
6. Would you guys recommend the reserves or active duty?              
7. Is there anything else I need to know?

So I just found out I’m pregnant and I’m just waiting for my waivers to get approved! Long story short, MEPS told me I could only enlist 6 months after a miscarriage, which was on the 1st of January, I had a few miscarriages last year so I’m not super confident with this one and we weren’t even trying since I always wanted to enlist and was focused on that. What do I do if everything gets approved, can I postpone my shipping date without telling them what going on, or tell them l’m sick or something? I wanna wait my pregnancy hit the 3 month mark to be sure nothing will happen and then tell them I’m pregnant. But I don’t wanna tell them I’m pregnant and have another miscarriage and wait for another 6 months. What do I do?

More questions regarding reserve benefits:                 
1. I have a somewhat lengthy list of certifications I would like to earn. Some are from CompTIA. Others are not. Are these all covered?               
2. Will the army cover earning a master's degree? If so, what is the process? Is it reimbursement, or do they pay directly?             
3. Medical Insurance. How does that work out? I got bluecross blueshield and I'm experiencing a bit of ""culture shock"" since I spent most of my adult working life in Asia and had 100% free medical care while I was there. Broke my ankle a few months ago (literal fracture, my job in America requires heavy lifting) and couldn't work for a few months. Is it better? worse? Just like civilian life?               
4. Do people in the reserve still get bonuses?

I'm trying to decide whether to go infantry in the guard or Civil affairs/psyop in the reserves. I like the physicality and ""army stuff"" that the infantry does, but I'm also interested in the cultural and interpersonal piece of CA/PO. Also would like to deploy. Looking at the guard/reserves since I have a decent career and wish to stay near family outside of training/deployments

Screenwriter Looking for Help with a Script about the Ranger Indoctrination Program in 1988

Hi, all! I am planning a screenplay whose sole premise is to follow a 21-year-old as he goes through RIP in 1988 from start to finish (spoiler alert: he becomes a Ranger). I feel this premise, with this particular character, could make a helluva screenplay and, if produced, a helluva movie folks would want to watch. I'm thinking, the film ""Tigerland"" meets the documentary ""Hell and Back: Special Ops Ranger"". I'm intrigued by a story where we watch a young person pushed to his absolute limit -- then, pushed even further, to find depths within himself he had no idea were there and of which he was capable.

I would love to hear from you guys who went through RIP: anyone who went through RIP, whether you became a Ranger or not and whether it was 1988 or not. If you would like to type your replies here, in which you discuss and describe your experiences, that would be great. If you would like to join me on a Zoom, either individually or collectively, that would be even more terrific -- a video diary of sorts. 

I truly look forward to your replies to the above. I have a feeling this is the start of a fascinating journey. My warm-felt thanks in advance.

Cheers, Will

Can anyone please verify the following?

My understanding is (and I do beg your indulgence and patience, as I am a civilian, and I can and probably so easily do have all this wrong) that a Soldier could find himself going through RASP twice, according to the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RASP 1/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS/RASP 2 (I suspect I have grossly simplified that progression). Yes? No?

How about, though, 1988, when of course RASP was the Ranger Indoctrination Program? Would that progression look something like the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RIP/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS - commission as 2LT and start of one's career as an officer? Yes? No?

As an ancillary question: Is it a case that all Rangers in the 75th Ranger Regiment must have passed RASP 1 or they are not a Ranger but they might have also passed RASP 2 or is it a case that ALL Rangers have passed RASP 1 \*and\* RASP 2?

Thanks in advance to your replies to all the above.

Cheers, Will

Thinking of enlisting and am just trying to know what to expect. It’s not a matter of choice, (meaning: I’m not going to join if so and so) just want to see what to expect. 
Are the latrines like stalls? Do the stalls have doors on them? Obviously is a shock if the stalls don’t have doors on them as we are used to being in private when pooping but I would understand as we are in this together and are all equals. Just crossed my mind and thought I ask, appreciate any replies.

Does the following sound in the least bit plausible?

I have the following scenario in one of my screenplays: in June, 2006, in Western Iraq Al-Qaeda jihadists capture an American USACOE CPT and drag him across the desert to their cave hideout. 

My best friend is 75th Ranger Regiment (ret.), and he tells me that all Ranger assets in the area will immediately deploy to rescue this officer, bringing their might down upon these sorry bastards.

Here's my question to you all: This captain has an older brother who is a MJR in the Rangers and who is in Iraq at the time of this incident. Would the MJR be allowed to participate in his brother's recovery or would he be told to sit this one out and allow other Rangers to handle it?

Thanks! I look forward to your responses.

Before I make a new post I figured I should ask here. I didn't see anything like this asked in the previous posts so here goes:

I recently graduated from college with a chemistry degree and a 3.64. For just over 2 years I was taking Welbutrin, which was a medication for helping with my smoking cession and the anxiety that came with it. I took it for so long because after it was initially prescribed I moved states and just saw telehealth doctors for refills. I went to the recruiter when I was still a junior and found out that after taking it for over a year it disqualified me for 3 years before commissioning. Since March 2024, I quit cold turkey and still finished my spring summer and fall semesters with mostly A's, supported my cost of living with a part time job and graduated without any medical or psychological intervention. After meeting with the recruiter again today, they said to wait until March to send off my MEPS application with a waiver from an MD stating that I am fit for duty. My questions are:

1. Would a generic MD be better than a psychologist or psychiatrist? My recruiter said that those doctors would draw red flags at MEPS

2. Is there anything I can do besides the waiver or waiting another 2 years?

Hi I just qualified yesterday at MEPS, I originally decided I was going 11B and wanted to ship in February but not my recruiter is saying there are no ship seats till May. I considered looking at 19D. Can someone help me understand the difference between 19D and 11B and tell em about promotion opportunities and school opportunities for both?

Can I bring a little (around 4"" x 6"") journal with some inspirational photos with quotes I like taped inside to basic training? It has a lock on it.

I just thought it'd be nice to take a minute or two sometimes to look at the quotes to inspire myself since I'm sure my life is gonna be very tough for a few months, and to have the journal to write if I have the time.

I also have a bunch of addresses and phone numbers written down in case I need them.

I’m freshly 18 and have interest in becoming an Animal Care Specialist for the army. 

However, I don’t know know if it’s possible for me. 

My goal is to become a Veterinarian assistant but I’m not sure that would even lead to me to eligible to be an animal care specialist. 

I don’t have much support on the idea either, and can’t get unbiased advice. 

I don’t believe I could score high enough on the ASVAB let alone get a good score on it. 

If you have this specific job, any thoughts, advice, or personal experience you can share with me?

Hey guys,

26 years old, just finished my BSN in Nursing.

Years ago fresh out of high school I originally went to college for business (MIS). I wanted to be an Army Signal Officer at the time (did the first two years of Army ROTC but unfortunately things didn't work out. Didn't have the best experience with my program bundled with an unexpected hernia that hit me at the time.) Ended up graduating with that degree and got a job in Healthcare IT.

The job was okay but ultimately I wanted something else (had me traveling to a different state on a weekly basis, felt there wasn't much opportunity to advance, and ultimately just had no interest in this line of work.) Went back to school for my ADN, got a job as a psych nurse for a year and finished my BSN which is where I'm at right now.

Now that I have the opportunity I've been thinking about it again, open to AirForce as well this time. I want to experience something different and the GI Bill could be used for my NP school. I have off on Friday and plan on going to the different AMEDD Recruiter offices.

TL;DR - Did any of you guys join as Officers in your mid to late 20s? Any regrets? Did you feel old and or behind your peers?

Hi there. I wanted to ask if it is possible to sign a 3 year contract as a 68W. I know 4 years tends to be the norm, but unfortunately I cannot allow to do 4 years for personal reasons. I would love to do AD for a 3 year contract, but if I can't, I probably will do reserves. 

Has anyone heard of a 3 year contract for 68W? If so, how rare is it to get it?

Tech school credits for auto-promoting?

I’m scheduling MEPS for next week and I’m doing fingerprints this afternoon. 

When I first sat down with the recruiter, he told me that my 26 college credits from vocational training and a ‘future soldier program’ that I have yet to learn about can get me into BCT as an E-3. I haven’t graduated the tech school program yet, I’m about a month away from it.

I’ve also been told to make sure all promises are in writing in my contract. He and his 1SG have told me that they can add the automatic promotion after signing but before my ship date, but I’m wondering if I should just postpone signing until I have the certificate and can get it in writing?

It’s all a very confusing process (by design..?) and I’d like some advice from someone not incentivized to get me in.

Howdy folks, Air Force nerd here trying to make sense of Army shenanigans for a friend.

Buddy is trying to go on Terminal Leave, but the date he is supposed to start conflicts with the back side of a period of ""going to the field"". He seems to believe his command won't let him leave ""the field"" early, and won't be able to start Terminal Leave until after he gets back. This seems asinine to my Air Force smoothbrain, but I also know the Army is known for its shenanigans. Additionally, I don't always get the unvarnished truth from this guy, so I don't know the situation he has described to me is what's actually happening. Can someone point me to an Army reg that definitively says whether or not he is going to be able to do his final out and leave at the date he originally intended?

Hey all,

Wanna ask this question on here so I can be an anonymous dumbass, not a dumbass to my recruiter. 

I have gone to MEPS already and sworn in with the MOS 68W, something I’m passionate about due to my love of EMS and already having my national EMT cert. I don’t leave until 3/31 due to delayed enlistment (I went to MEPS early November) because I was finishing my bachelors degree. Everyone I’ve talked to as called me a dumbass (I’m aware lol, I thought/think my passion for my MOS outweighs me wanting to commission. Ontop of wanting to be led before becoming a leader for personal moral reasons).  Im thinking more about it and want to know if it is too late to talk to my recruiter about wanting to commission as an officer instead?

Hello all. I have a number of waivers and a specific time maximum to join up. Here they are:

1. Juvenile record from 2019 which I’m getting expunged.
2. Tattoos which I’m getting removed.
3. Mental Health consultation which I was discharged from recently, and medication (Lexapro) which I’ll soon run out of.

I tried to join in 2020 and couldn’t get a waiver due to my record; yet I did well on my asvab - 90th percentile.

I just talked to a recruiter and they said to wait until 2027 as that’ll be 2 years since I’ve taken medication. When that time comes, could I actually get in?

10th Mountain or 82nd Airborne for Rangers?

TLDR: Which is best to prepare for RASP? 10th Mountain or 82nd Airborne?

By April (when my 1st year of college ends) I will not be ready for RASP which is why I chose to enlist into a conventional unit before attempting RASP. I’m simply wondering which of these units will provide the most benefit for an 11B to later tryout for RASP?

When you get your boots sized in reception, should I give my actual shoe size or give slightly higher or lower?

I wanna make sure my feet dont get fucked up.

Trying to go 19K through 19U

Recently found out about the brilliant decision to join these MOSs. Is there any way that I can increase my chances or guarantee a spot as a 19K through any means? Is there any duty station that happens to only have abrams and not bradleys or cav scouts? Would doing well in OSUT make it more likely to get picked for 19K as opposed to 19C or D? Also, a advisor ""informed"" me that airborne 19U is an impossibility and the m10 booker was tested by infantry not 19K if any of you could offer further insight on that ""information"".

Re code 3

Good day all. I was in the army in ‘09 I did 9 months and got discharged for patterns of misconduct. (Uniformity errors such as late to formation, not shaving; an article 15 for an empty bottle of alcohol in my wall locker and another for having someone else’s belonging in my wall locker) they summed all of this up into 3 article 15s and recommended me for discharge with RE Code 3: pattern of misconduct separation code jka. I was 19 at the time and now I’m 35. I have been periodically trying to re enlist. Even in reserve but I have been disapproved. It’s important to note that in 2016 I had a dwai. No misdemeanor or felony. Just a violation and had to pay court fines. According to my last attempt last year the recruiter told me that this is why the army will not accept me back. I’m willing to travel to any recruiting station to finally be able to clean my name and re enlist again even if it’s reserve. Please if anyone can help that will be great.

Does the MOS 35P require a recruit to take the DLAB **if they already claim proficiency in another language?**  
Another way to phrase this question: Can I enlist, and then do some combination of taking the DLPT or the DLAB?

Context: I live in the middle of nowhere and most of the recruits are high schoolers trying to escape the place I'm in. I think my recruiter hasn't encountered someone who is bilingual in a critical language where I live. On paper, 15 years ago I took a test that says I can read 1200 words in Chinese, but now it's more like 2500-3000.

Hi all,  
I’m looking into the Army and I’m trying to figure out which job would best align with my career goals. I am 3 classes away from Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at WGU, and would like to do coding work while serving. Ultimately, after I leave the military, I want to pursue a career as a Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Cloud Engineer.

So far, I’ve found 17D (Cyber Operations Specialist) and 170D (Cyber Network Defender) as potential options. What’s the difference between these two? And are there other jobs in the Army that would give me relevant coding and technical experience for my future career?

I'm specifically looking into the Army because I've been told that my MOS is guaranteed, whereas in other branches it's not so.

Thanks in advance!

# Felony Waiver, who knows about it?

12 months ago I got arrested for attempting to elude a police officer, a felony, literally 3 weeks before I was supposed to ship to Basic training... I did a first offender program, which consisted in fines, community service, driving course, and now followed by 12 months of probation. I will be done with probation in a few months, and then I will have my record expunged.

My question is, does anyone have experience with DPMP Moral Conduct Waivers for felonies? What are the chances of it going through for something like this?

I believe that it being expunged from my record doesn't even matter for recruiting purposes right?

By the time I would be able to sign a new contract, it would be about 2 years after the offense.

I'm a 17E in currently in AIT, im fresh out of high school. I have airborne on contract. I was also offered to volunteer for RASP and go to regimen, but I don't know how that will work out career wise. Being in AIT, I'm not sure if this army shit is what I want to do with my life. I know from being around signal guys my whole life that regimen can fuck your career path in 25 series, is it the same with 17E? How it was described to me, it can boost it but that was also the Ranger Liason so there might be some bias. 

Looking for any input from people who have done this longer, not asking for 17E specificly or just Rangers. Just needs some advice before I make this career change.

Planning on going 17E option 40 as I was told by friends and family in the military that it's the best balance between learning a useful skill and still getting to do ""cool guy sh\*t"". What do 17E's do in the army and if I make it to regiment will I be able to kick in doors with infantry or will I just be sitting in an office?

Couple questions in regards to a reclass. Currently an 11B seeking to reclass to a 35N. Meet all qualification criteria, ASVAB etc. The career counselor that I’m working with has said that I have submitted all the necessary ppwk, and after HRC has received it I have been told that #1 the class date must be minimum 1 year out, and #2 there are no available class dates, and classes will only become available when enough people sign up for it. I am currently undergoing the security clearance process that’s required for the MOS with possibly another month or two before adjudication. This leaves me at a standstill, with time on my contract burning away and no news if I’ll even be able to make this work. I might possibly have to wait on promotion or training opportunities as a result, and don’t know if it’s worth it to wait. 
I’ve heard the National Guard offers full time positions under this MOS, and Im in contact with both a unit and recruiter who would be willing to work with me, however I understand the whole recruiting shtick and would like some third party information. My wife is really pushing for me to go NG I just want to hear both sides, and nobody I work with or associate with has any experience with 35N’s. I would appreciate it if someone were to shed a little light on the following questions. 

Question #1 Does anyone know how frequently the AIT classes for this MOS are scheduled, and if there’s anything on my part I can do to better secure a position when one becomes available?
Question #2 Is it worth it to hold out for an active duty class and job, or should I just ETS and go with the national guard? Maybe someone who has experience with one of the above can let me know how their experience was? 
Question #3 could I contact someone from the community I could ask further questions regarding the admin side of things? I understand this a nuanced situation and a lot of details that go unexplained on a post. 

Appreciate all the help, I’ll take a mango loco monster and two ranchero rollerbites.

So, I was told recently that anyone who's 11B or similar in other branches doesn't get much time to workout, and that's a role I really wanna get into, is this true? Or do y'all find ways around getting in shape in your job?

Looking into the army. Got an undergraduate degree in Chinese Language and Literature (can read more than 2500 words and both traditional and simplified script). I work in data center deployment.               

Situation: Been looking online recently at cybersecurity jobs. Many require an active security clearance, some with polygraph and some without.                 

Goal: In addition to the certifications I hope to earn in the next few years (OCSP, Cisco CyberOps Professional Certification, CompTIA Linux+, and CASP+), I got a Network+ and Security+, and I'm studying for a CySA+ as we speak. I might even be tempted to get a master's degree in Cybersecurity later on.               

Before I get my hopes too high and pull the trigger on a four year contract, it would be a good idea to ask these questions:               
1. I need to know what kind of questions they will ask on the polygraph exam. As an example, I knew a guy who looked enough like his cousin that (before he was 21) he was able to borrow or steal his cousin's ID, get into a club, then got arrested for something and used his cousin's ID as the ID they documented him with at the precinct. This guy also told me he engaged in sexually deviant behavior in America (call girls). Got got a secret background (but not TS as far as I know) clearance.                
2. I spent a literal decade of my adult working life outside of America. I need to get caught up on my taxes. I made a considerable amount in capital gains. Is this going to be an issue anywhere along the way with my prospective career path?                 
3. My wife is not American. We applied for her green card. Is this going to be an issue with an active secret / top secret background clearance?              
4. What MOS would you guys recommend? I did look in to 17C, but I am doubtful that I would get into that MOS as it requires a TSI with a polygraph.                 
5. With the certifications that I listed above, would it be a good idea to earn some of these before I enter the army? I have a few months of free time on my hands and I study hard.               
6. Would you guys recommend the reserves or active duty?              
7. Is there anything else I need to know?

So I just found out I’m pregnant and I’m just waiting for my waivers to get approved! Long story short, MEPS told me I could only enlist 6 months after a miscarriage, which was on the 1st of January, I had a few miscarriages last year so I’m not super confident with this one and we weren’t even trying since I always wanted to enlist and was focused on that. What do I do if everything gets approved, can I postpone my shipping date without telling them what going on, or tell them l’m sick or something? I wanna wait my pregnancy hit the 3 month mark to be sure nothing will happen and then tell them I’m pregnant. But I don’t wanna tell them I’m pregnant and have another miscarriage and wait for another 6 months. What do I do?

More questions regarding reserve benefits:                 
1. I have a somewhat lengthy list of certifications I would like to earn. Some are from CompTIA. Others are not. Are these all covered?               
2. Will the army cover earning a master's degree? If so, what is the process? Is it reimbursement, or do they pay directly?             
3. Medical Insurance. How does that work out? I got bluecross blueshield and I'm experiencing a bit of ""culture shock"" since I spent most of my adult working life in Asia and had 100% free medical care while I was there. Broke my ankle a few months ago (literal fracture, my job in America requires heavy lifting) and couldn't work for a few months. Is it better? worse? Just like civilian life?               
4. Do people in the reserve still get bonuses?

I'm trying to decide whether to go infantry in the guard or Civil affairs/psyop in the reserves. I like the physicality and ""army stuff"" that the infantry does, but I'm also interested in the cultural and interpersonal piece of CA/PO. Also would like to deploy. Looking at the guard/reserves since I have a decent career and wish to stay near family outside of training/deployments

Screenwriter Looking for Help with a Script about the Ranger Indoctrination Program in 1988

Hi, all! I am planning a screenplay whose sole premise is to follow a 21-year-old as he goes through RIP in 1988 from start to finish (spoiler alert: he becomes a Ranger). I feel this premise, with this particular character, could make a helluva screenplay and, if produced, a helluva movie folks would want to watch. I'm thinking, the film ""Tigerland"" meets the documentary ""Hell and Back: Special Ops Ranger"". I'm intrigued by a story where we watch a young person pushed to his absolute limit -- then, pushed even further, to find depths within himself he had no idea were there and of which he was capable.

I would love to hear from you guys who went through RIP: anyone who went through RIP, whether you became a Ranger or not and whether it was 1988 or not. If you would like to type your replies here, in which you discuss and describe your experiences, that would be great. If you would like to join me on a Zoom, either individually or collectively, that would be even more terrific -- a video diary of sorts. 

I truly look forward to your replies to the above. I have a feeling this is the start of a fascinating journey. My warm-felt thanks in advance.

Cheers, Will

Can anyone please verify the following?

My understanding is (and I do beg your indulgence and patience, as I am a civilian, and I can and probably so easily do have all this wrong) that a Soldier could find himself going through RASP twice, according to the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RASP 1/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS/RASP 2 (I suspect I have grossly simplified that progression). Yes? No?

How about, though, 1988, when of course RASP was the Ranger Indoctrination Program? Would that progression look something like the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RIP/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS - commission as 2LT and start of one's career as an officer? Yes? No?

As an ancillary question: Is it a case that all Rangers in the 75th Ranger Regiment must have passed RASP 1 or they are not a Ranger but they might have also passed RASP 2 or is it a case that ALL Rangers have passed RASP 1 \*and\* RASP 2?

Thanks in advance to your replies to all the above.

Cheers, Will

Thinking of enlisting and am just trying to know what to expect. It’s not a matter of choice, (meaning: I’m not going to join if so and so) just want to see what to expect. 
Are the latrines like stalls? Do the stalls have doors on them? Obviously is a shock if the stalls don’t have doors on them as we are used to being in private when pooping but I would understand as we are in this together and are all equals. Just crossed my mind and thought I ask, appreciate any replies.

Does the following sound in the least bit plausible?

I have the following scenario in one of my screenplays: in June, 2006, in Western Iraq Al-Qaeda jihadists capture an American USACOE CPT and drag him across the desert to their cave hideout. 

My best friend is 75th Ranger Regiment (ret.), and he tells me that all Ranger assets in the area will immediately deploy to rescue this officer, bringing their might down upon these sorry bastards.

Here's my question to you all: This captain has an older brother who is a MJR in the Rangers and who is in Iraq at the time of this incident. Would the MJR be allowed to participate in his brother's recovery or would he be told to sit this one out and allow other Rangers to handle it?

Thanks! I look forward to your responses.

Before I make a new post I figured I should ask here. I didn't see anything like this asked in the previous posts so here goes:

I recently graduated from college with a chemistry degree and a 3.64. For just over 2 years I was taking Welbutrin, which was a medication for helping with my smoking cession and the anxiety that came with it. I took it for so long because after it was initially prescribed I moved states and just saw telehealth doctors for refills. I went to the recruiter when I was still a junior and found out that after taking it for over a year it disqualified me for 3 years before commissioning. Since March 2024, I quit cold turkey and still finished my spring summer and fall semesters with mostly A's, supported my cost of living with a part time job and graduated without any medical or psychological intervention. After meeting with the recruiter again today, they said to wait until March to send off my MEPS application with a waiver from an MD stating that I am fit for duty. My questions are:

1. Would a generic MD be better than a psychologist or psychiatrist? My recruiter said that those doctors would draw red flags at MEPS

2. Is there anything I can do besides the waiver or waiting another 2 years?

Can I bring a little (around 4"" x 6"") journal with some inspirational photos with quotes I like taped inside to basic training? It has a lock on it.

I just thought it'd be nice to take a minute or two sometimes to look at the quotes to inspire myself since I'm sure my life is gonna be very tough for a few months, and to have the journal to write if I have the time.

I also have a bunch of addresses and phone numbers written down in case I need them.

I’m freshly 18 and have interest in becoming an Animal Care Specialist for the army. 

However, I don’t know know if it’s possible for me. 

My goal is to become a Veterinarian assistant but I’m not sure that would even lead to me to eligible to be an animal care specialist. 

I don’t have much support on the idea either, and can’t get unbiased advice. 

I don’t believe I could score high enough on the ASVAB let alone get a good score on it. 

If you have this specific job, any thoughts, advice, or personal experience you can share with me?

Hey guys,

26 years old, just finished my BSN in Nursing.

Years ago fresh out of high school I originally went to college for business (MIS). I wanted to be an Army Signal Officer at the time (did the first two years of Army ROTC but unfortunately things didn't work out. Didn't have the best experience with my program bundled with an unexpected hernia that hit me at the time.) Ended up graduating with that degree and got a job in Healthcare IT.

The job was okay but ultimately I wanted something else (had me traveling to a different state on a weekly basis, felt there wasn't much opportunity to advance, and ultimately just had no interest in this line of work.) Went back to school for my ADN, got a job as a psych nurse for a year and finished my BSN which is where I'm at right now.

Now that I have the opportunity I've been thinking about it again, open to AirForce as well this time. I want to experience something different and the GI Bill could be used for my NP school. I have off on Friday and plan on going to the different AMEDD Recruiter offices.

TL;DR - Did any of you guys join as Officers in your mid to late 20s? Any regrets? Did you feel old and or behind your peers?

Hi there. I wanted to ask if it is possible to sign a 3 year contract as a 68W. I know 4 years tends to be the norm, but unfortunately I cannot allow to do 4 years for personal reasons. I would love to do AD for a 3 year contract, but if I can't, I probably will do reserves. 

Has anyone heard of a 3 year contract for 68W? If so, how rare is it to get it?

Tech school credits for auto-promoting?

I’m scheduling MEPS for next week and I’m doing fingerprints this afternoon. 

When I first sat down with the recruiter, he told me that my 26 college credits from vocational training and a ‘future soldier program’ that I have yet to learn about can get me into BCT as an E-3. I haven’t graduated the tech school program yet, I’m about a month away from it.

I’ve also been told to make sure all promises are in writing in my contract. He and his 1SG have told me that they can add the automatic promotion after signing but before my ship date, but I’m wondering if I should just postpone signing until I have the certificate and can get it in writing?

It’s all a very confusing process (by design..?) and I’d like some advice from someone not incentivized to get me in.

Howdy folks, Air Force nerd here trying to make sense of Army shenanigans for a friend.

Buddy is trying to go on Terminal Leave, but the date he is supposed to start conflicts with the back side of a period of ""going to the field"". He seems to believe his command won't let him leave ""the field"" early, and won't be able to start Terminal Leave until after he gets back. This seems asinine to my Air Force smoothbrain, but I also know the Army is known for its shenanigans. Additionally, I don't always get the unvarnished truth from this guy, so I don't know the situation he has described to me is what's actually happening. Can someone point me to an Army reg that definitively says whether or not he is going to be able to do his final out and leave at the date he originally intended?

Hey all,

Wanna ask this question on here so I can be an anonymous dumbass, not a dumbass to my recruiter. 

I have gone to MEPS already and sworn in with the MOS 68W, something I’m passionate about due to my love of EMS and already having my national EMT cert. I don’t leave until 3/31 due to delayed enlistment (I went to MEPS early November) because I was finishing my bachelors degree. Everyone I’ve talked to as called me a dumbass (I’m aware lol, I thought/think my passion for my MOS outweighs me wanting to commission. Ontop of wanting to be led before becoming a leader for personal moral reasons).  Im thinking more about it and want to know if it is too late to talk to my recruiter about wanting to commission as an officer instead?

Hello all. I have a number of waivers and a specific time maximum to join up. Here they are:

1. Juvenile record from 2019 which I’m getting expunged.
2. Tattoos which I’m getting removed.
3. Mental Health consultation which I was discharged from recently, and medication (Lexapro) which I’ll soon run out of.

I tried to join in 2020 and couldn’t get a waiver due to my record; yet I did well on my asvab - 90th percentile.

I just talked to a recruiter and they said to wait until 2027 as that’ll be 2 years since I’ve taken medication. When that time comes, could I actually get in?

10th Mountain or 82nd Airborne for Rangers?

TLDR: Which is best to prepare for RASP? 10th Mountain or 82nd Airborne?

By April (when my 1st year of college ends) I will not be ready for RASP which is why I chose to enlist into a conventional unit before attempting RASP. I’m simply wondering which of these units will provide the most benefit for an 11B to later tryout for RASP?

When you get your boots sized in reception, should I give my actual shoe size or give slightly higher or lower?

May sound like a dumb question, but I only ask this bc there have been instances where I use shoes/boots (e.g. bowling) and the shoes feel too floppy. I wear a size 12 but bowl with a size 11.5.

I wanna make sure my feet dont get fucked up.

Trying to go 19K through 19U

Recently found out about the brilliant decision to join these MOSs. Is there any way that I can increase my chances or guarantee a spot as a 19K through any means? Is there any duty station that happens to only have abrams and not bradleys or cav scouts? Would doing well in OSUT make it more likely to get picked for 19K as opposed to 19C or D? Also, a advisor ""informed"" me that airborne 19U is an impossibility and the m10 booker was tested by infantry not 19K if any of you could offer further insight on that ""information"".

Im leaving for basic training in a month and I was pretty out of shape before but been working on it. I can do like 30 push-ups and make the 2 mile run in time, but still can’t do a pull-up no matter what I do. How badly will this inhibit me at basic, and will they do pull-ups at PT in the morning? Or am I worrying too much?

Re code 3

Good day all. I was in the army in ‘09 I did 9 months and got discharged for patterns of misconduct. (Uniformity errors such as late to formation, not shaving; an article 15 for an empty bottle of alcohol in my wall locker and another for having someone else’s belonging in my wall locker) they summed all of this up into 3 article 15s and recommended me for discharge with RE Code 3: pattern of misconduct separation code jka. I was 19 at the time and now I’m 35. I have been periodically trying to re enlist. Even in reserve but I have been disapproved. It’s important to note that in 2016 I had a dwai. No misdemeanor or felony. Just a violation and had to pay court fines. According to my last attempt last year the recruiter told me that this is why the army will not accept me back. I’m willing to travel to any recruiting station to finally be able to clean my name and re enlist again even if it’s reserve. Please if anyone can help that will be great.

Does the MOS 35P require a recruit to take the DLAB **if they already claim proficiency in another language?**  
Another way to phrase this question: Can I enlist, and then do some combination of taking the DLPT or the DLAB?

Context: I live in the middle of nowhere and most of the recruits are high schoolers trying to escape the place I'm in. I think my recruiter hasn't encountered someone who is bilingual in a critical language where I live. On paper, 15 years ago I took a test that says I can read 1200 words in Chinese, but now it's more like 2500-3000.

Hi all,  
I’m looking into the Army and I’m trying to figure out which job would best align with my career goals. I am 3 classes away from Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at WGU, and would like to do coding work while serving. Ultimately, after I leave the military, I want to pursue a career as a Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Cloud Engineer.

So far, I’ve found 17D (Cyber Operations Specialist) and 170D (Cyber Network Defender) as potential options. What’s the difference between these two? And are there other jobs in the Army that would give me relevant coding and technical experience for my future career?

I'm specifically looking into the Army because I've been told that my MOS is guaranteed, whereas in other branches it's not so.

Thanks in advance!

# Felony Waiver, who knows about it?

12 months ago I got arrested for attempting to elude a police officer, a felony, literally 3 weeks before I was supposed to ship to Basic training... I did a first offender program, which consisted in fines, community service, driving course, and now followed by 12 months of probation. I will be done with probation in a few months, and then I will have my record expunged.

My question is, does anyone have experience with DPMP Moral Conduct Waivers for felonies? What are the chances of it going through for something like this?

I believe that it being expunged from my record doesn't even matter for recruiting purposes right?

By the time I would be able to sign a new contract, it would be about 2 years after the offense.

[2025 in RoguelikeDev] Scaledeep,roguelikedev,1i6supy,2025-01-21 15:47:22,36,1.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/1i6supy/2025_in_roguelikedev_scaledeep/,darkgnostic,,"**Scaledeep** is a traditional fantasy roguelike that primarily focuses on gameplay driven by the items players acquire during their runs, with some decisions influenced by the chosen character class.

I began developing the game at the start of 2024, building it entirely from scratch. Armed with the extensive knowledge I had accumulated over the years about how ***not*** to create a game, I approached this project with a fresh perspective. Now, a year later, I’m pleased to say that, aside from a few minor refactor needs, I’m quite satisfied with the game’s quality and modular design.

I’ll share two screenshots—one from the start of 2024 and one from the end—to showcase the dramatic evolution of the game.

[First posted game screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/5r80jl8fmeee1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2323475e56f28e2eaf920e9228616a15b8440a)

[One of the last from the end of 2024](https://preview.redd.it/vpg3m4oomeee1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d7e2e7db5a9985744b22b3cec2f70f7cb5c4bcd)

**Game features** 

* **Dynamic Classes**: You can choose from four unique classes—Fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Cleric—with a twist. Each class can learn any spell or skill, with only initial stats and maximum stat caps setting boundaries. A Fighter can heal, a Cleric can unleash firebolts, and every spell and trigger is learned from rare spellbooks scattered throughout the dungeon.
* **Triggers**: Abilities that can be dynamically triggered, adding strategic depth to combat and gameplay.
* **Massive Enemy Variety:** There will be overwhelming waves of enemies, with over 200 unique monster types planned (40+ are already in the game), with distinct behaviors, strengths, and challenges to overcome. For now game seems funny and oddly satisfying while hacking and slashing through massive hordes.
* **Four Playable Races**: While the game will launch with humans as the first playable race, three additional races will be added, each bringing their own lore and gameplay twists.
* **Procedurally Generated Items and Environments**: Not only are items procedurally generated, but so is the 3D dungeon geometry.
* **Traps and Logical Puzzles**: You will need to navigate deadly traps and solve puzzles to progress deeper into the dungeon. There will be also two player specific co-op puzzles.
* **Dynamic Game Goals**:  The ultimate goal of each run is randomly determined, adding variety and unpredictability to the experience. Players might be tasked with retrieving a legendary artifact, learning a rare spell, defeating a powerful dungeon boss, rescuing a captive ally, or even surviving a relentless enemy onslaught to reach the surface. 20 different goals are planned, 1 will be available on initial release.
* **Couch Co-op**: Designed for two-player local co-op. (Four-player support was tempting, but the UI felt too cramped.)
* **Funny conten**t: Bunch of sketches will be created (I have only 5-6 for now, and my kids are loving them :D) that will randomly popup during gameplay. Usually funny content :) and the playback is skippable. 
* **Multilingual Support**: Launching with two languages, though procedurally generated item names make localization surprisingly hellish. Other languages are easily addable.
* **Fully animated pixel graphic**
* **Modding Support:** Some degree of modding will be supported

**Early Foundations: Dungeon Generation and Battle System** 

The first major achievement of 2024 was transcribing the entire dungeon generation algorithm from C++ to C#. This was a crucial step to modernize the codebase which also laid the groundwork for a more scalable and maintainable system. Alongside this, I created a Unity-based tool to store and manage dungeon generation setups, making them easily shareable (I love creating tools). Dungeon generation in Scaledeep is node-based, where each node represents a distinct part of the dungeon. These nodes are then ""topographed"" into a detailed map, with every node mapped to its corresponding section. The algorithm handles everything—from room layouts and connections to the placement of props and interactive elements. This step-by-step process allows for seamless expansion, making it easy to integrate new content, such as traps, puzzles, and environmental details. 

[Node layout](https://preview.redd.it/7xcpil8vneee1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c6e10847318651b9c8dcede87d48a2621363b0c)

[Generated dungeon](https://preview.redd.it/n572cr8vneee1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=b980573fc17678b7340231907a063566af025756)

While the dungeon generation system provided a solid foundation, the next focus was on developing the complete battle and game mechanics. Initially, all mechanics were built in a console project  before being transitioned into Unity. This console-first approach enabled the creation of a robust battle system with features like leveling, races, point distribution, and ranged combat. A sample battle simulator was also developed, streamlining the process of tweaking monster stats and abilities. 

Monster tables, with stats, experience rewards, and item drops, were created early in development, giving the game a complete set of enemies. These tables ensured that the foundation of combat and progression was strong, providing a clear framework for further content additions. 

**Mid-Year: Expanding Depth and Systems** 

By mid-2024, the focus shifted to refining existing systems and expanding the game’s depth. Dungeon layouts became more detailed, with improved lighting, destructible objects, and dynamic LoS calculations. Combat was enriched with features like knockdown attacks, multiple attack types, and dynamic stances for both players and enemies. 

On the AI front, pathfinding and enemy behavior saw major improvements. Dijkstra maps became a cornerstone for enemy movement, enabling wandering, flee, distance and pursuit behaviors. Animated lava was added at this point if I recall that right.

https://preview.redd.it/mia5lv7nqeee1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6d4740ccb22256536689d57cbe4b3d5a0ff6cf9

**Late 2024: Storytelling** 

In the latter part of the year, narrative and immersion took center stage. The Lua-based Sketch Director system was introduced, allowing for event-driven storytelling with multi-language support. This system handled everything from spawning actors and displaying dialogue to managing animations and timed delays. Speech bubbles were added for better readability. 

Game world became richer with new environments, enhanced cave systems, and a variety of new enemies. Performance optimizations and visual tweaks ensured that the game ran smoothly even as the complexity increased.

Here I started to work on environmental effects like animated fog:

[Animated fog](https://reddit.com/link/1i6supy/video/d1dprjldqeee1/player)

**Looking Ahead to 2025** 

A significant amount of content is still in progress and will be added to the game, including animations, the majority of enemies, effects, particles, and spells. 

And most importantly, the game is planned for release, at least in Early Access.

Need advice: Should I stick with my SAP business process analyst job or switch to a supply chain role?,businessanalyst,1i6qgri,2025-01-21 14:09:37,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalyst/comments/1i6qgri/need_advice_should_i_stick_with_my_sap_business/,Medium_Part_5830,,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in a bit of a dilemma about my career path and could really use some advice.

For the past 5 months, I’ve been working as a SAP Business Process Analyst Trainee in the IT department of my company. My role sits at the intersection of business and IT, and my primary tasks involve:

* Translating business requirements into technical specifications for developers. 
* Documenting business processes. 
* Testing the SAP application we’re developing. 

While I’m learning a lot about SAP, I’m not sure if this job is the right fit for me. I studied supply chain management and always enjoyed working with numbers, solving network optimization problems, and analyzing data. My current job is mostly about communication, documentation, and coordination, which I feel lacks the quantitative aspect I enjoyed during my supply chain management masters. 

Lately, I’ve been considering quitting to pursue a role more aligned with my interests and study background, such as:

* Demand Planner 
* Supply Chain Planner 
* S&OP Analyst 

Here’s where I’m stuck:

1. Should I stick with this job for at least a year to see if I end up liking it and to gain experience with SAP (which is widely used in supply chain roles)? 
2. Or should I make the switch now, since it might be harder to pivot the longer I stay in this IT-related role? 

I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or who has experience in SAP and/or supply chain roles. What would you do in my situation?

Thanks in advance for your input!"

Kubernetes best practices I wish I knew,platform_engineering,1i6mrdm,2025-01-21 11:38:52,6,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/platform_engineering/comments/1i6mrdm/kubernetes_best_practices_i_wish_i_knew/,kao-pulumi,,"My colleague wrote a [blog post](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/kubernetes-best-practices-i-wish-i-had-known-before/) on K8s best practices. A lot of them make a lot of sense, especially in the context of platform engineering. Here is quick summary of all the best practices:    
  
**1. Resource Requests and Limits:**  Don't skimp on setting these. They're your containers' baseline and upper bounds for CPU and memory. Start with a baseline and adjust based on actual usage. Tools like Prometheus or Datadog are your friends here.

**2. Namespace Like Your Life Depends on It:**  Deploying everything into the default namespace? Big no-no. Use namespaces for organization and isolation. They help with access control and resource quotas, keeping your cluster tidy and secure.

**3. One Container Per Pod:**  Unless you have a good reason (like sidecar patterns), stick to one container per Pod. It simplifies scaling and troubleshooting.

**4. Use a Package Manager for YAML Files:**  Managing YAML manually is a nightmare. Tools like Helm or Kustomize can save you from YAML duplication mania. Helm charts are particularly handy for customization.

**5. Ingress and Networking:**  Set up your Ingress Controller properly. Use path-based routing, manage TLS termination at the ingress layer, and keep your network topology clean.

**6. Probes Are Your Friends:**  Liveness, readiness, and startup probes are essential for Kubernetes to understand your containers' health. Start with readiness probes to avoid premature restarts.

**7. Security First:**  Implement RBAC from day one, use Pod Security Admission, and manage secrets wisely. Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text or environment variables.

**8. Monitoring Is Non-Negotiable:**  With containers coming and going, you need robust monitoring. Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, ELK/EFK for logs, and tracing tools like Jaeger for microservices.

**9. Automate Deployments:**  Manual deployments are a thing of the past. Use CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins or embrace GitOps with Flux or Argo CD. Automation reduces errors and speeds up delivery.

**10. Keep Kubernetes Updated:**  Stay current with Kubernetes versions. Test upgrades in dev environments first, and always backup your etcd. Managed services like EKS or GKE can simplify this process.

**11. Labels and Annotations:**  Use them wisely for grouping and metadata. A consistent strategy here helps in managing and filtering resources effectively.

**12. Multi-Environment Approach:**  Isolate your environments. Separate clusters for dev/staging and production or use strict namespace segregation if you must share.

**13. Optimize Container Images:**  Go for lightweight base images, clean up your Dockerfiles, and scan for vulnerabilities. Smaller images mean faster deployments.

**14. Logging Strategy:**  Centralize your logs, use structured formats, and define retention policies. You'll thank yourself during troubleshooting.

**15. Treat Kubernetes Like Cattle:**  Embrace immutable infrastructure. If something's wrong, fix it in the code or image, redeploy, and let Kubernetes handle the rest.

**16. Consider Higher-Level Tools:**  For complex deployments, tools like Pulumi can manage your infrastructure with real programming languages, offering better maintainability and cross-cloud flexibility.

Building NixOS 24 Snapshots on Hetzner Cloud with Packer - My Learning Journey,NixOS,1i6mjex,2025-01-21 11:29:44,22,0.93,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/1i6mjex/building_nixos_24_snapshots_on_hetzner_cloud_with/,meysam81,,"Hey fellow DevOps engineers!

I've been wanting to try out NixOS for a while and finally took the plunge by setting up a proper build pipeline using Packer on Hetzner Cloud. I documented my experience in a blog post, hoping it might help others who are curious about the same stack.

What you'll find:
- Complete Packer configuration for building NixOS 24 snapshots
- The entire setup script including disk partitioning and NixOS configuration
- Real challenges I faced
- Bonus OpenTofu code for deploying servers from the snapshot

I'm definitely not a NixOS expert, and there might be better ways to do this. The configs are working but probably not optimal - I tried to document my thought process and include necessary explanations for each step.

If you've implemented something similar or have suggestions for improvements, I'd love to hear your approach. The main goal is to learn and share experiences with the community.

Things to Check Before Choosing a Polygon Validator for Staking POL,0xPolygon,1i6kmnf,2025-01-21 10:07:18,13,0.93,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/1i6kmnf/things_to_check_before_choosing_a_polygon/,kirtash93,Educational,"Today I decided to make this little guide on some things to have in mind when choosing a validator to stake your Polygon.

First of all, a reminder that you can only stake your POL on Ethereum Network so if you want to stake take in count that ETH is necessary for gas fees and that there could be a high it. For experience weekends at night while EU is sleeping is a great time to do things to reduce costs. There are a lot of sites like[ this one](https://milkroad.com/ethereum/gas/) to check this metrics.

Now lets go to the point, how to choose a Polygon Validator. We need to consider several things:

**Reputation and Track Record**

Always look for validators with a solid reputation. Those who have been around for a long time and have a good history of being reliable, fair practices, community engagement, etc. For this you should check social media, forums and the Polygon staking dashboard [here](https://staking.polygon.technology/)

**Performance Metrics**

Validators always need to be online to maximize staking rewards and for this you should check if validators are 100% uptime, if they consistently provide better returns because they optimize the process and if they miss blocks which is a signal of poor performance.

**Commission Rates**

Validators usually charge a commission, a percentage of your rewards, for their services (everybody have to win right). Now you will think that the lower is the best option but you should do your election based on this. You should compare with performance and reputation.

**Security**

It's important to also DYOR about the security of the validator just in case there is some sort of hacking track, mismanagement, etc.

**Decentralization**

Delegating to smaller validators helps to improve the networks decentralization so personally I suggest not over delegating to large validators so the ecosystem maintains balanced.

**Validator Communication**

Another important thing to look to is if the validator is active with their community, if they have discord, if they are transparent, etc.

**Extra experience tip**

This comes from my experience from being a delegator since 2021. If you are going to become a validator, set an alarm to check the validation rewards and everything once every month. Long time ago happened to me that my validator stopped providing services and fortunately lost only a few weeks of staking rewards but I have a friend that his validator stopped working in 2021 and a month ago when he went to check the rewards... Ops, just a few months of rewards. He ""lost"" 4 years of staking just for not checking things once in a while. You can imagine the anger and disappointment in that moment.

In the image above you can see the validators home page with some of the most performing validators in the ecosystem and interesting data like the commission, checkpoints signed, health status. Things to check before deciding which one validate for.

In the image above you can see more in deep information about an specific validator like the owner POL balance, total stake, validators stake, total rewards earned, delegators, etc.

In general I suggest to stake your POL because it helps the project, it puts your coins to work and also the process is quite easy to do.
