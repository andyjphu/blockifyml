Affordable and Scalable Hosting Options for New Web Designers: Suggestions Needed,Web_Hostinger,1i9axwk,2025-01-24 19:49:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Web_Hostinger/comments/1i9axwk/affordable_and_scalable_hosting_options_for_new/,zibraniliala,,"Hey everyone! I’m starting to create websites for companies and looking for more affordable options than WordPress Business hosting. I aim to host websites for at least 10 clients in the next two years and grow from there with a base that will support my business long-term. I'm a graphic artist and a part-time student studying front-end development. I'm new to hosting management but excited to learn. My budget is between $5 to $15 USD per month (up to $20 CAD max, but the lower, the better.  
I live in Canada, and most of my clients are from here, so it's important to have stable hosting that works well in this area. Most of the websites I host are WordPress. Sometimes, I also use Shopify or Squarespace, but I’m not sure if those can be housed elsewhere. I expect client websites will get between 1,000 and 10,000 people each month, so I'll need enough bandwidth to handle future growth as we expand.  
I don't have experience handling servers or infrastructure. I'm just beginning to learn about MySQL databases, but I'm not yet comfortable with things like VPS or Linux server management. I've looked at the ""hosting Reddit"" suggestions and other information, but I'm still unsure what would work best for me. I’d appreciate any recommendations for budget-friendly hosting platforms that are easy for beginners and can expand as my business grows. You're welcome!"

B1/B2 Rejection for 27M India,usvisascheduling,1i8rspm,2025-01-24 04:40:01,20,0.75,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/usvisascheduling/comments/1i8rspm/b1b2_rejection_for_27m_india/,paranoid_android_0,,"Appointment Details : 

Appointment date - 24th Jan, 2025
Time - 9 AM (IST) 
Location - Kolkata, India 

Background : 

27M Engg with 4.5 years of work experience in analytics. I worked for 1.5 years in ZS and then another 3 years in an Indian startup. 

In Dec 2024, I received an admit from the Indian School of Business for an MBA. My session would start from April ‘25, so my family and I decided to go on a vacation to the US in March. 

Hence, I resigned from my company in Dec, and served my last day on Jan 10th. So technically, I am on a career break right now. 

My parents and my sister already have a US Visa. I had already made a payment of 7L to the B-school. I had carried all the receipts with me. 

Questions asked - 

1. What is the purpose of visit? Vacation. My sister lives in Cali. 
2. What does your sister do? She is a housewife. Her husband works as an SDE. 
3. How long will you stay? 2-3 weeks. 
4. When does your B-school start? April’25
5. What was your salary? (between 1700 to 2000 USD per month) 
6. What was your designation? Senior Data Analyst. 
7. Have you travelled internationally before? Yes. UAE in 2010, Spain in 2017, and Singapore in 2018. 

Unfortunately, my VISA was rejected under 214b and I’m extremely gutted. I know my background isn’t very strong but I did have strong reasons to come back to India - higher studies! 

There’s no point of applying this year. Can someone please tell me when should I apply for the visa again? Should I apply after my B-school when I have a stable job? Should I apply right before my marriage (whenever that happens)? Please help. "
How should I handle a job offer I accepted after already starting a new job?,careerguidance,1i7xufk,2025-01-23 02:08:11,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1i7xufk/how_should_i_handle_a_job_offer_i_accepted_after/,markiel55,Philippines,"Hi Reddit,

I badly needed some advise here.

Let me just start by saying that I really want to stay at a very ""secure"" job after experiencing unemployment for over 6 months.

A few bit of the story, I am based in the Philippines and I have quit my job last July 2024 voluntarily due to burn out and depression. I had no back up plan back then and I thought I could find a job not as bad as others have experienced it since I have over a decade of experience in the industry and had few senior titles. I was clearly wrong in this regard.

Last month, I have luckily received two offers from two big companies (US-owned, under S&P 500). Company A pressured me to accept their offer within few days after I pass their interviews, while company B offered me 2 weeks after I have accepted the offer from the other.

Here’s what I’m dealing with:

# Company A

**Cons**

* **Team Dynamics:** I’ll be working with colleagues from different countries, including India and the Philippines. In the past, I’ve had trouble with communication and teamwork when working with Indian colleagues, which could make things difficult.
* **Onsite Interaction:** The job is mostly remote, with only two days a week required to be in the office. This doesn’t give much chance to build a strong connection with my coworkers, which I really want after working from home for the past 4 years.
* **Personal Isolation:** After working from home for so long, I feel isolated, and I’m worried this setup won’t help much.
* **Pay Cut:** The salary is PHP 15k lower than my previous job.
* **Big Client:** I’ve been assigned to a large client, which can be demanding and stressful in consulting roles.
* **Tech Stack:** I’ll be working with mobile development and some proprietary systems that I don’t think will help me grow much as a developer.
* **Location:** The office is in an area with few food options and activities after work, so it’s not the most convenient.
* **Night Shift**.

**Pros**

* **Job Stability:** The company is known for being stable, even though I’m not sure about the specific project.
* **Financial Perks:** They offer a sign-on bonus worth 2 months’ salary, plus a discount on company stocks.
* **Employment Type:** It’s a direct hire, which usually means better long-term benefits.

\--------------------------

# Company B

**Cons**

* **Job Security:** The job isn’t a direct hire at first, but they promised I can become a full-time employee based on my performance.
* **Night Shift:** same as Company A.

**Pros**

* **No Pay Cut:** The salary is the same as my previous job, so no reduction.
* **Team Dynamics:** The team has Filipino coworkers, and I’d be working with U.S.-based colleagues remotely. This could make communication easier and help me build stronger relationships with my team.
* **Tech Stack:** I’d be working with new technologies like MAUI, Blazor, microservices, and IoT, which could help me grow professionally.
* **Regularization Promise:** They’ve promised to absorb me as a full-time employee based on my performance, which gives me some security.
* **Preference for .NET:** I prefer working in .NET for better job security, which makes Company B more attractive.

Now for the questions:

* How likely is it that I’d be blacklisted by Company A if I quit shortly after joining?
* I’m unsure how to handle the lock-in period for the sign-on bonus, especially since I haven’t received it yet. For those who’ve left a job early despite a lock-in agreement, how did you manage it?
* I told **Company B**’s recruiter that I had just accepted the offer from **Company A**, but in reality, I’ve started working there for few days already. Now the recruiter is asking what I would do differently to rescind. For context, it seems their client *really* wants me. I even had a virtual meeting with their owner trying to persuade me. I’m considering asking for a sign-on bonus, maybe equivalent to 1 month’s salary, and setting my salary at PHP 200k - 17% increase.
* What would you do in my situation?

For conversion PHP 15k is \~USD 255, PHP 200k is USD \~3.4k but I'm not sure if this is helpful at all due to CoL.

Thank you for reading."

Li-Ning Gamma 1,BBallShoes,1i5y52t,2025-01-20 14:08:29,24,0.97,32,https://i.redd.it/qmu2m8ch67ee1.jpeg,FlatwormEastern4574,Performance Review,"Performance review from someone who has never receive shoes but plays a lot of ball and watches plenty of reviews :)

Background: 
23 years old, 6’5, 195 pounds, 38” vert, size 13

Position: 2-4

Favorite hoop shoes of all time: 
Jordan 34, KD 12, WOW10


After watching many reviews and going back and forth between these, the Liren 4v2, or WOW 10 lows,
I decided to go with the Gammas. I payed 205 USD after taxes on POIZON for the black colorway, so not bad considering the original retail price.  

I went with these over the Liren 4v2 because of the carbon fiber plate. I get pretty bad pain in my feet if my shoes don’t have a shank plate, and for me, the stiffer, the better. 

Fit: 8/10
I have normal to wide feet. The Gammas come with a thick boom foam insole that has a grippy texture. Even with thin socks, the shoes were too tight with the OG insole, so I took a thinner midsole out of some old ultraboosts and that has worked well so far. It also makes the shoes much easier to put on, as the OG insole will pull on your sock as you slide your foot in.

Lengthwise, these are true to size. Width wise, they are slightly narrow. If you like to lace your shoes up super tight, I would recommend wearing thicker socks, because the lightweight materials will pinch the top of your foot, since the padding is minimal everywhere but the heel.

I recommend TTS unless you have very wide feet. Normal to wide feet, you may need a thinner insole.

Traction: 10/10
Not much to say here. I play on a decently clean court, so I can’t speak much to how they would perform on a dustier court, but the grip is unreal. Zero wiping is needed. Based on other reviews, and my own personal experience, these have perfect traction.

Stability and Containment: 10/10
I’ve had a 3rd degree sprain on the left ankle and 2nd degree on the right, so stability is the most important thing to me in a shoe. The width of the outsole on these, along with the minimal but effective outrigger on the forefoot, makes the shoe feel stable and planted without being cumbersome. The stack height is also on the thinner side, and this adds to the stability.

As far as containment goes, I feel very confident in these. Even without the shoes laced super tight, they feel very responsive and my foot didn’t slide around at all. The grippy insole that comes in these would probably make them even better. The upper is a thin material with minimal stretch, and I never felt like my foot was shifting around in the shoe too much or sliding over the foot bed.

Cushion: 9/10
I love the setup here. The carbon fiber and BOOM foam combo feels snappy and responsive with great court feel. I felt like an elite defender with these on. My only complaint is that my feet did hurt, but only after playing these for 3+ hours straight. What you gain in the low to the ground setup, you lose in impact protection. I didn’t mind, but if you’re a bigger guy, and I’m talking 220 plus, or have bad knees, you may need something more plush. 

Final Verdict: 9.5/10
For 90% of players, this is the perfect shoe. Amazing grip, supreme bounce, and perfect containment, all packaged up in one of the lightest shoes money can buy. Unless you have super wide feet or are a bigger guy, you’re going to love these. I would happily pay $200 plus for another pair.

Bonus Dunking Specific Review:

I spent about 90 minutes just dunking in these. If you are a dunker and want a shoe to just dunk in, check out the WOW 10s or the Lining Yushuai Ultra. They both have  elite traction with full length carbon fiber, but are going to feel more bouncy from the extra stack height. For me, the minimal extra weight those have would not be a deal breaker.

Please feel free to ask me questions about these or just life in general in the comments. Hope you enjoyed the review!"
"Questions, related to my planned build",pcmasterrace,1i5l6yk,2025-01-20 02:51:03,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1i5l6yk/questions_related_to_my_planned_build/,alvin4frnds,Hardware,"**Budget (including currency):** 180,000 INR (2079 USD)

**Country:** India

**Games, programs or workloads that it will be used for:** 

AI related: 

1. stable-diffusion needs to run compatibly, around 200 produced images, which could take 1-10 iterations each to get perfect. So inflated number would be 2000 images.



2. Other LLM models, like gpt-03, llama3, even biggest 1 should run, biggest LLM that I have encountered until now is 18GB that is llama3.3.

3. I will training the models on some very specific self-generated images / content, we have around 20K images now, but it should handle upwords of 2M images to train effectively.

4. I want to be able run it on both Linux and Windows, because both machines have their pros but I like linux for consistensy.



OS related: 

1. Linux should be compatible, (I know linux is compatible with almost all systems out there). 

My workload requires running multiple 2-3 VMs, i usually run them 6-8 hours a day, depending on which software client i am working with. They don't need to be very performance focused, mainly firefox / dbeaver / terminal / notepad and VPN.

Multiple docker containers for services.

IDE wise PHPstorm, Dbeaver, Chrome are the heaviest application i work with.

LLM and stable diffusion



2. Windows

Photoshop (marketing material - medium load), 

Casual medium games - dirt rally, nfs, forza, snow-runner, asseto corsa etc.



**Other details** (existing parts lists, whether any peripherals are needed, what you're upgrading from, when you're going to buy, what resolution and refresh rate you want to play at, etc): 

The budget is for Cabinet only, all other peripherals I have already.

I currently have a 6 year old, intel i7 6900 processor with RTX 2060 and 32 GB DDR4 RAM (max the motherboard can support). It runs most games flawlessly, and only limit is that newer LLM models are not loading because of RAM.



This is what I have picked till now. (127989 INR | \~1479 USD)

**AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (12 Cores, 24 Threads, Up to 5.6 GHz)** 1

**MSI Pro B650 S WiFi** 1

**GSkill 96GB (48GBx2) Trident Z5 RGB 6400MHz DDR5 CL32 - Black** 1

**Integrated Graphics (iGPU)** 1

**WD Black 2TB SN770 Gen4 NVMe (Read/Write upto 5150/4850MBps)** 1

**MSI MAG A750GL 750W 80+ Gold Fully Modular (ATX 3.0)** 1

**NZXT H9 Flow - Black** 1

**Deepcool LT360 ARGB Liquid Cooler - Black** 1

**None / Pre-Installed Fans (As per Cabinet)**



It will use 2060 from previous computer, until new Nvidia's 50 generation cards launches.



**My questions are as follows**

1. this and RTX 5070 / RTX 2060 (current). will it be enough for LLM models

2. with this board, can I use 2 graphic cards at once, I see there are slots, but how will it work and which card I need to connect my monitors to.

3. Adding multiple M.2 SSD, will it effect Graphic cards performance, I read they use same lanes.

4. If i go with 2 RAM now, and later expand to 4 RAM of same size and frequency, will it hinder the performance, because I read RAM needs to be consecutive serial number ( or part of a kit) to run dual-channel

I'm a 23-year-old SOC L1 Analyst from Lebanon, currently working in cybersecurity. Despite my passion for this field, the economic and political situation here makes it nearly impossible to build a stable future. I’ve managed to save about $1,500 USD, but my current income barely covers living expenses.

I’m looking to immigrate legally and start fresh in any of the following: Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, or New Zealand. I’m hardworking, eager to contribute, and continuously developing my skills. I’ve caught a zero-day cryptominer during an investigation, which fueled my passion for cybersecurity. I’m also a decent malware analyst and actively working to improve in this area.

I’m open to starting from the ground up and putting in the effort to succeed. 

Thanks for reading."

I’m looking for advice on how to best allocate my money for a medium-to-high risk investment strategy. I have worked very hard for my money and have a fear of losing it, I want to work on accepting that I make good money, am pretty young < 30 and that if I make a mistake, I will learn and still be fine. My ultimate goal is to become a millionaire in 2027.

**Current investments / cash ready for investing:**

* **€100k** in EUR in HYSA EU.
* **$50k** in USD in a HYSA US.
* **€60k** in stocks / crypto
* Stable monthly income of around €10k after tax.
* Monthly spending around 5k. 
* No debt, no mortgage, no kids, no wife.

**Goals:**

* Grow my net worth to €1M by end 2027
* Learn about investing and money, stop YOLO's.

**What to consider:**

* I have a cash buffer for emergencies.
* From my EU money, profits from crypto / stocks is not taxed as income so I pay a lot less taxes if I invest in the EU. If I use money from the US, it will be taxed as income in the US. I am debating using US money to live, while using EU money to invest.
* I am not a US citizen, I have a visa that allows me to technically contribute to a Roth IRA but I'm not sure if I want that because I will have to take it out early, so income taxes + penalty will apply.
* No options trading, I don't think I can handle that. 

**Questions for you:**

1. I am new to (serious) investing, I have been reading, I know about index funds and ETF's and vaguely understand the difference. What would you do in my shoes?
2. Are there specific theories, books, advice you would recommend or NOT recommend.
3. What am I missing? What would you do?

I appreciate any feedback or personal experiences. Looking for actionable advice, not motivational fluff. Thanks in advance! 🙏"

I’m reaching out to get perspective/suggestions on working in China as a US expat. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to expect in terms of working as a US expat out there and what the conditions are like? Also do people have suggestions on how to network and find jobs out there? Finally, what do people think I can expect in terms of reasonable finding good, fulfilling, and financially stable work out there relative to my line of work?

To give some perspective on me: I am in my mid-to-late 30s and currently work in supply chain as an advanced analytics professional with experience across a lot of different high-impact projects in inbound, fulfillment, and e-commerce operations. I used to live in China when I was much younger and have dreamt of going back to Asia for a long time after falling in love with life out there. After living in a few different cities in the States, I feel my longing to return to Asia has resurfaced after putting it off for years, so now I’m looking for work out there that is similar to my line of work now. I don't think it would make sense to be a teacher again because I don't see that as sustaining my current lifestyle or career, but I guess I'm open to that idea.

For perspective, although I know I would make less money working out there, net-net, I would hope my take home from new work would be around the same (my salary is currently $150k USD and I work on the West Coast of the United States). I’m also looking at Taiwan and Singapore, and am prioritizing Mandarin speaking cities because I have some familiarity with the culture and language and I feel that’s a good head start (and am 6 months in to taking private lessons again). I'm not fluent by any means but I have a good foundation to start with and am really enjoying the journey of learning Mandarin again.

Apart from looking at job boards on LinkedIn, applying, and hoping for the best, I would love counsel or suggestions on finding a way to find work and what to expect. I am also going to be traveling to Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Taipei next month to scope out how it feels to be in each city and am open to making new connections along the way.

Thanks for the read and for any recommendations in advance."

Was saving this case to do a dual x79 or dual x99 one day for shiz and giggles, but needed a garage pc to record shit and built one a few weeks back

I had rebuilt an x79 a few weeks ago with old parts laying around the garage... used an old used chinese x79 machinist but it was a micro atx without ssd. So i ordered a chinese x79 turbo mobo that has said m.2 to build a pc for the garage.

Missed the old beeping this turbo board makes at start up. I use to have this mobo with a e51650v2 years ago.

Had a E5 2670V2 (10 core/20 thread 2.5-3.3) in the MATX board but wanted a lil higher clock so switched up with the other cpu i still had. Had overclocked the 1650 on this board to 4.1 stable years ago.... but dont feel like spending 10 dollars on a 1650..

Anywho the build is a E5 2667v2 (8 core/16 thread 3.3-4.0 ghz) 32gb ram in quad, gtx 1070.  Better GPU and this thing could probably play some newer stuff huh?

Tempted to bring my 1440p UW n 3070 to the garage to bench some stuff. Wonder if this cpu could manage  a 5xxx or Rx 9xxxx

IDK if it worth building if you dont have any old parts, but i had 2 cpus, plenty of ecc mem and all the other parts. only rebought the turbo mobo from taobao for 30 ish usd. If i had to buy more parts would probably do a used 1-2nd gen ryzen..

Dont mind the shoddy cable management, the last build a few weeks ago was even worse. garage scrap pc."

Jelly Star One Week Review,unihertz,1i0kbta,2025-01-13 13:09:51,15,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/unihertz/comments/1i0kbta/jelly_star_one_week_review/,FL-DadofTwo,,"A week ago, I posted my initial thoughts after my first 24 hours using a Jelly Star. I received a little bit of feedback, so I figured I would share my thoughts after a full week of use. This is by no means intended to be a full professional review - it's simply my personal thoughts based on my experience so far.

I'll follow the same format as my previous post, with a few additions.

Overall Size: I've gotten used to the small size a lot easier than I thought I would. Not just the screen, but the device as a whole. It's so nice to be able to slip it into my pocket and hardly feel it without checking. Usually with traditional sized smartphones, and larger devices like the S24 Ultra I used previously, you can definitely feel them when sitting or moving around if you keep them in a front pocket. That's not really that bad, but this has been a nice little (pun intended) perk.

Screen: Only 1 or 2 times where app scaling has been a minor issue. Nearly every app I've tried scales down just fine for the smaller display. In direct sunlight it can be a little hard to read, which was typical of all smartphones until just a few years ago. Coming from the S24 Ultra which has one of the best displays on the market, it's definitely a downgrade, but at this size and this price point it is completely acceptable.

Sound: Overall pretty good. This is not really a media device, obviously. If you did decide to watch videos on it however, I think it would be fine. Speaker call quality is completely fine, and it gets just as loud as basically every other phone I can think of. Very reasonable performance here.

Connectivity: Again, I am using Mint Wireless and live in a relatively dense suburban area. I've had no coverage issues anywhere I've gone, including in buildings, etc. I would describe the mobile network experience as identical to the other phones I've used on the same network, so reception is on point, at least in these bands. Also, I've had no issues with bluetooth connections to other devices. The connections are stable, responsive, and work just as you'd expect. I used it to stream music to some earbuds while I worked outside for about 3 hours or so this weekend, and never had any issues.

Battery: Battery life has been pretty good. The battery is small by modern standards, at just 2000 mAh, but it's good for a device this size. I routinely used wireless Android Auto during my commute and an unexpected longer drive this week, without charging, and never had the need to charge during the day even with that longer drive. I've generally been ending the day with anywhere from 20-40% charge. If you use it heavily I can definitely see killing it partway through the day, though charging time has been relatively quick thanks to the small battery. Additionally, I have not experienced any charging issues, which I think I read about other users experiencing. I've used a variety of cables, in different charging scenarios, and haven't experienced any problems.

NFC: It works just as you'd expect, nothing really to report here. The phone does come with an NFC spoofing app built in, which I thought was odd. I believe it will let you copy unprotected/unencrypted NFC cards and the like.

Fingerprint Reader: This is my one complaint and regular pain point, though overall it's minor for me. The fingerprint reader is not as reliable as I am used to. I routinely have to try several times to get it to work. In fact I would say probably 2/3 times I try to use it, it does not verify my fingerprint. To be fair, this is an inexpensive device, so to have a fingerprint reader at all is a plus. Hopefully this can be improved on any future implementations. I also find that the placement is a little awkward, though it's also completely understandable that the engineers are limited by the physical size constraints. I wish the camera lens and fingerprint reader were swapped, so that the reader was in a somewhat more natural position.

GPS Accuracy: Appears to be a little bit less accurate than I'm used to from other devices, but not to the point where it has caused me any issues. I have no had a chance to use it on foot, but in vehicles it is fairly quick to acquire a signal and seems to figure out which way you're going quick enough. It's a tad bit slower than I'm used to, but that may also be due to the size of the device.

Camera: It works, basically. Perfectly adequate for snapping pictures of unimportant things in good light, such as receipts or scanning documents, or simply documenting something. Low light performance is generally poor, which is exactly what I would expect at this price point. Do not plan to use this device for the camera, if that is important to you. I would not want this to be the only camera I have to take pictures of my kids.

OVERALL: In my opinion there are 2 huge perks to this device that overwhelm the few flaws; Size, and Price. There are virtually zero options on the market for anything resembling a modern smartphone at this size, and to actually get a reasonably well made device with good specs and performance for only $220-$230 USD is great. If this phone were twice the price, I'd feel differently about it, but it's not. My screen time is down by over half, and that's including time I've spent setting things up, exploring features, etc. It's a tiny device that still does all of the normal smartphone tasks many of us need and want, but the small size and simple novelty of using it make it easier to treat it as a tool, rather than a display to get sucked into. I've really enjoyed using it this week, and I'm planning to keep it as my daily driver for the foreseeable future."
Notes on Compliance and historic Seasonality,RVSN,1i0egky,2025-01-13 08:54:52,37,0.97,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/RVSN/comments/1i0egky/notes_on_compliance_and_historic_seasonality/,PewPewDiie,DD,"With RVSN approaching NASDAQ compliance, let's examine what this means for the company's trajectory and why 2025's commercial developments matter more than short-term price action. I want to chime in and *set expectations ""right""* for compliance and offer  my thoughts on the historic seasonality we've seen, building on my experience and perspective.

[Also, please see my previous post on grasping the long term roadmap for RVSN from an analyst perspective.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RVSN/comments/1hqis5z/rvsn_dd_yall_are_missing_the_forests_for_the_trees/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

# 1: Compliance

The stock market is a veichle for pricing assets ""correctly"". Well what is a ""correct"" price? Fundamentally the equilibrium found between buyers and sellers, that is to say the price that the equity is currently trading at. All market participants has access to the same base information, and (at a best case) uses their brain somewhat.

*Well how do exceptional investors make above average returns?* It comes down to one of two things, or a combination of the two:

**1: Advantage of information:** Acting on obscure, hard to find or insider data.  
**2: Advantage of Interpretation:** Having a superior ability to process and interpret the available information differently from the market consensus.

A lot of confusion about how the market acts can be avoided by understanding this. Look at NVIDIA’s November ’24 drop after stellar earnings—the market had already priced in those results. Advantage of interpretation doesn’t come from just correctly predicting the next thing, but from predicting the next thing **and** the thing after that—**plus** how market sentiment will react to it. *Market participants are the sole price-setters.*

`(Sidenote: Many would argue that predicting steps down the line is a fools errand as chaos make predictions too unstable - one would be correct if not considering the tendency for systems to gravitate towards certain paths as a result of the system trying to achieve it's goal, making the chain of events gravitate towards those paths as it tries to stochastically find the path of least resistance through time. Understanding these systems in play touches upon advantage of interpretation, but that's a story for another time on business analytics)`

**How does this tie into compliance?**

Reaching compliance is easy to predict—*a monkey could do it by looking at the 10-day chart and checking off a list.* There’s no advantage of information and minimal advantage of interpretation here. I’m not downplaying compliance—it’s just that in the short term, it’s priced in, **so expecting some big immediate reaction is foolish.**

`Sidenote: Compliance letter from SEC usually takes a few days - 2 weeks to arrive and it is at that point and onward that any compliance effects are in play.`

Tying back to my point on thinking multiple steps down the line and estimating effects on market sentiment.

*Compliance is* ***not totally insignificant*** *in the long run as:*

**1. Institutions:** Many institutional investors have mandates preventing them from investing in sub-$1 securities. Compliance opens broader access to capital, supporting stable, long-term institutional ownership.

**2. Cost of Raising Capital**: Non-compliance makes for less negotiating leverage when entering capital raising processes (loans -> higher interest premiums, Dilution -> higher price premium given up). Having compliance is one less factor to the position of weakness, enabling access to slightly better terms. Has an effect in the long run.

**3: Market Perception & Business Development (sales):** When we are in a contract negotiation process, we always assess the counterpart risk-wise. This is so that we don't sell, buy or partner with a counterpart that will be out of business in 6 months. Basically  some basic DD on eventual risks connected to 100% downside of the agreement, essentially customer & partner confidence in long term viability, can also have an effect on talent aquistion and retention capabilities long term. Same goes for market participants (ppl buying / selling shares), as you know, not having the equity in your portfolio delisted is GREAT but for larger investors it's the BARE MINIMUM.

So compliance matters less for the technical requirement and immediate effects, and more for enabling the optimal execution of their go-to-market strategy. *Real value creation lies in how compliance affects operational leverage over time.*

# 2: Historic Seasonality

[Log scale - sensible because market interpretation is through &#37; up\/down, not absolute price action](https://preview.redd.it/xknxhh6i4rce1.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e0e6b1c3230c463df39bc790fae34e8eb2095b)

*On seasonality: While others have done deeper analysis, here's my macro perspective.*

Often, the market gets ahead of itself. This happens when equities like this one get priced too far ahead, or when events unfold in a much different way than anticipated.

Looking at the last peak, this appears to be the factors that was in play:

**1: Flurry of actual good developments for RVSN:** Partnerships, some initial pilot orders, initial regulatory approvals.  
**2: RVSN active promo:** of these developments, captializing on the news, also self reinforcing cycle as of the quick gains as short-time holders enter the train (pun).  
**2.5: Price overextension:** The market cap **approached $500M**—unsustainable for a pre-revenue company. It priced things too far ahead and near perfection from a 2023 standpoint. The downward price correction started, compounded by market disinterest in edge infrastructure solutions at the time. Revenue ramp-up was still 1–3 years away.

Then, in March, a few minor institutional holders exited, releasing more shares into a market that wasn’t interested → further downward pressure. Also, capital flows to AI at the time were more oriented toward “building” than toward applied real-world solutions.

*Note, I quickly checked against other cyclical tailwind indicators and found only a mild connection to the micro-cap emerging tech cycle.*

[\(On log scale, not as significant - any connection made is to bear factors pushing it down after the overextended peak\). Used REKR and LTRX for edge and infrastructure microcap interest.](https://preview.redd.it/8pmib6647rce1.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd7059b9dbacdd81da107e6df96277f523123a57)

**All is to say, the factors for sustained market cap in the 100's of millions USD was not there.**

**And now?**

There's a few key things:  
**1. Business Cyclicality:** RVSN shouldn’t be more cyclical than any other player in the space. Slight cyclicality might come from fiscal quarters ending or pre-holiday deals (especially in the EU).

**2. We are significantly closer, if not at, the go-to-market stage:** No1 reason I choose to stay in the equity now is because Rail Vision is at the point where hyped pilots from previous cyclical movement *can* conclude and transpire into orders that makes a significant difference on revenue.

**3. Market tailwinds look strong for 2025**: Tailwinds matter because the market pricing of an equity depends on them (think the P/E difference between AVGO and IBM). In EU industry, ADAS and edge computing are big themes for 2025. Edge AI—where RVSN operates—will be continue to be a hot topic.

I've noticed this from EU industry in terms of ADAS and edge computing (this is backed up by mckinsey reports as well), edge AI (AI running on device, like RVSN systems does) is a big theme of 2025. We can see this among other **strenghtening tailwinds in the market for 2025:**

**- Edge Applications**  
**- Intelligent infrastructure & ops**  
**- Enablement of Autonomous Operations**  
**- Operational efficiency from AI solutions** (focus on demonstrating value it rather than say it when evaluating buy-orders)  
**- AI based systems for providing & making use of big data** (a slightly different take than in 2021 whoop whoop)

I’ve said before: **The proof is in the pudding.** RVSN is at the “prove it” stage. Big commercial orders (not just pilots) for 100+ systems are what will really affect price, due to the impact on price/sales multiples. Train fleets are huge—even small operators have 100+ locomotives (and many more carts). *Proper orders represent tens of millions in revenue and move the needle.*

**All this to say:** Short-term, *perceptions of cyclicality can bite investors* (because if consensus believes it, it often becomes reality). Any movement or confirmation of *large orders* will negate this perceived cyclicality. **H1 of 2025 is key.**

**25’ is just getting started.** *If* one or two larger orders land in the first half of ‘25, I see a market cap in the low hundreds (of millions USD) as probable. Revenue needs to show up. Until then, the market can do whatever it does—I’m not selling either way.

# A final point for you who are loosing sleep over daily price

That most likely means that you have exceeded your risk tolerance with the capital you have placed. Let me iterate that **loosing sleep is not worth it. It also makes for hasty and bad investment decisions and most often to more pain than what it's worth.** Best course of action would be to gradually adjust to a position that you're comfortable with holding. **Be guided by your own conviction as a market participant, not someone else's.**

The potential here for real gains lies in the long term. Nothing is 100%, all is probabilities. You can take advantage of the expected range of outcomes, but that involves being exposed to the long tail of bad outcomes as well.

* yes. I'm aware that spamming the sub might not be the way to do it, but it's all I've got.

Buttttttt- I'm excited. I think this is really cool and I don't see a lot of discussion surrounding **Allogeneic Adipose Matrix (AAM)** injections, a **treatment for volume loss.**

I just learned what an AAM injectable was—like, last Friday? But totally inadvertently, like I wasn't asking about volume loss. I was discussing with my dermatologist my own ✨surgical facial fat graft ✨ I had done while I was in Korea. More importantly, I was explaining to him how this **literally** made me an ass-face.

>My dermatologist: So you got a fat graft done?

>Me: yeah- thats why im an ass-face. Get it? They harvested it from-

>Derm: Did they add Renuva to the cells they harvested?

>Me: *recovering from getting cut off…* Ummmm, probably? What's Renooba?

>Narrator: she in fact had not gotten Renuva.

It ended up working out for the best because I would still pick the fat graft PLUS the injection, but I'll explain why later on. Bonus- I can share from a patient perspective what both procedures were like.

 

**Currently, Renuva and Allofil are the first non-surgical alternatives to traditional fat grafting for cosmetic volume loss.** They’re FDA-approved, off-the-shelf injectables derived from human adipose tissue—yes, dead people’s fat. The ✨cadaver fat✨ is carefully processed, decellularized, and (allegedly) de-haunted, leaving behind a matrix of collagen, growth factors, and the structural framework of fat tissue for your own body to fill in. Unlike autologous fat grafting (where your own fat is harvested and re-injected), Renuva and Allofil come ready-to-use, no liposuction or separate harvesting procedure required.

If you suffer from facial fat loss, you know exactly why this is thrilling. If you’re one of those lucky assholes who have no idea what I’m talking about—don’t worry, I’ll enlighten you.

Aging is a multifactorial process (I wrote something about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/1daqexw/a_guide_to_current_practices_in_cosmetic_derm/)). It starts with your cunty little sister telling you that you look tired paired with sobbing on the bathroom floor at Bestia on your 30th birthday. Ultimately it culminates in visible changes in your skin. These changes aren’t just in your head— they’re the tangible results of timed hormonal and biological processes switching on and off. The proof? You’re here and still banned from that restaurant. 

Hi, welcome to 30plusskincare.

   

# Blame the Epidermis First

The epidermis—being the outermost layer—is the first to show signs of aging, thanks to its “soft” composition and constant exposure to environmental evils. Sometime in your mid-20s to early 30s, collagen production starts to nosedive by 1–2% annually. At first, it’s subtle. Then the telltale signs of dermal elastosis (a fancy term for elastic fibers in the skin becoming disorganized and damaged) and repeated sun exposure kick in.

# Then Perimenopause/Menopause (40s–50s)

Women experience a sharp drop in estrogen, which is intimately linked to collagen production, and can lose up to 30% of their skin’s collagen in the first five years post-menopause—followed by an annual \~2% decline. Yay.

# But That’s Not All

1. **Facial Fat Loss**
   * That youthful plumpness you once took for granted slowly disappears, leaving behind hollows—both literal and emotional.
2. **Laxity of Facial Retaining Ligaments**
   * The ligaments that keep your fat pads in place decide to give up. Consequently, everything starts drooping, especially under the eyes.
3. **Bone Resorption**
   * Your face’s structural foundation quietly shrinks, causing further volume loss and overall sag.

All of this happens in that exact order, so if you’ve noticed your face looking a bit deflated lately—congrats, you’re right on schedule.

# Facial Fat Loss Over Time

* **Late 20s–Early 30s**: Subtle fat redistribution. Cheeks and under-eyes start to lose volume *very* gradually, often masked by early dips in collagen.
* **Mid-30s–Early 40s**: Fat loss becomes noticeable—cue nasolabial folds, tear trough hollows, and mild jowling.
* **Mid-40s–50s**: More severe fat loss, especially in temples, midface, and around the mouth. Hollow cheeks and deeper folds mean you can’t deny reality anymore.
* **60s and Beyond**: Significant fat depletion. When combined with skin laxity and bone resorption, you’re left with an “I’ve lived, but at what cost?” look.

**Bone Resorption**

* **30s–40s**: Quiet changes in the eye sockets, cheekbones, and jawline. Subtle, but it’s happening.
* **40s–50s**: Picks up pace. Orbital rims widen (welcome under-eye hollows), cheekbones flatten, the jaw shrinks.
* **60s and Beyond**: Major bone resorption, especially in the maxilla (upper jaw) and mandible (lower jaw). This leads to a shrunken lower face, accentuated sagging around the mouth, and a hollowed appearance.

# Why the 30-Plus Crowd Should Care

By your mid-30s, the earliest but most significant signs of facial fat loss begin to poke through. Suddenly, subtle hollows and shadows demand attention, and your old skincare routine no longer cuts it. That’s why you might feel frustrated when you post a selfie asking for quick fixes and there's people like me who insist that a topical solution isn't going to cut it.

So, whether you’re commiserating in the “I lost my cheekbones somewhere in my 30s” club or still existing in smug ignorance, just know the ghost fat injections exist. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/dm35d5c7jjce1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fcd454b9ca3de48fcff56674918287758bef1b6

Okay, but this is what makes **Allogeneic Adipose Matrix** injections really exciting. Basically everything currently offered for soft tissue volume restoration is… Well there’s no happy medium, no Goldilocks zone to the options presented.

I can imagine feeling very overwhelmed by the idea of pursuing a surgical procedure if just starting your research. Like to sit down and find out that the most commonly suggestion corrections are either a fat graft or HA fillers? It could feel kinda hopeless if you're note ready for surgical intervention.

That doesn't make other options bad ones. I am emphasizing the value that AAM have within current treatment options.

# Traditional Fat Grafting

* **What It Is:** Using your own fat, which is harvested and then re-injected somewhere else in your body.
* **Why People Love It:** It’s natural, semi-permanent, and if your body cooperates, the results can last for a good while. This is still the gold standard, and will yield the greatest results on average. 
   * **Survival Rate of Fat:** About 30–70% of the transferred fat lives on; you have no clue which fraction your body will decide to keep.
   * **Multiple Surgeries:** You may need more than one round to get your dream outcome.
   * **You Need Fat:** If you’re skinny in the “right” places (or the “wrong” places, depending on perspective), you may not have enough donor fat to begin with.
   * **Recovery:** Expect being overfilled and puffy for a while, then watching some of the volume vanish, hopefully not *all* of it.
* **My Experience:** I did it—YOLO—because I was *already* undergoing surgery and had no idea Renuva and Allofil existed. But as I mentioned, I'm still happy I did both. They took fat from my anterior thigh.
   * Thats the other thing- liposuction fucking sucks. I’m happy to talk about it but “tHiS isNt a pLaSTic sUrgEry sUb” - Karen, self appointed topic moderator 

# HA Fillers (Hyaluronic Acid)

* **Pros:**
   * **Immediate Results:** Walk in hollow, walk out plump.
   * **Customizable:** You or your injector can sculpt as you go.
* **Cons:**
   * **Temporary:** Lasts 6–18 months. Your bank account hates you.
   * **People seem to hate it:** I'm not going to get into this here, but I recognize that many people don't like having a foreign substance injected into their face and then not metabolizing as promised. 
   * This sums up how i feel about the topic: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DENMObXR7V2/](https://www.instagram.com/p/DENMObXR7V2/)
   * As a side note: People on here have cited scientific articles *supposing* complications from fillers. And I’m not referring to ones where the injection was lumpy or needed post-op care- that's due to poor injector competency. I’m referring to concerns like blocking lymphatic drainage. But if someone has the time can you please share these with me? The last three I reviewed were misinterpreted by the poster.
   * Whatever if you don’t like it, you don’t have to justify why- I get it. 

# PLLA Injectables (Sculptra)

* **How It Works:** Stimulates collagen production in the dermis over time.
* **Advantages:**
   * **Gradual Improvements:** Looks pretty natural—if you have the patience of a saint.
   * **Good for Widespread Volume Loss:** If you don’t mind multiple sessions.
* **Caveats:**
   * **Delayed Gratification:** Takes months to see final results.
   * **Limited Mechanism:** It’s collagen stimulation, not actual fat replacement, so it won’t restore that chubby-cheeked baby face. While this works to a certain extent, collagen in the dermis will never provide the same amount of volume as fat. 
   * **Managed Expectations:** Perfect if you’re good at waiting and tempering hope.

# Volufiline (that thing that got a bunch of attention on TIkTok) 

* **How It Works:** Volufiline is a cosmetic ingredient derived from a combination of hydrogenated polyisobutene and plant extracts (most notably from the roots of *Anemarrhena asphodeloides*).
   * In theory, it stimulates adipocyte (fat cell) differentiation and volume in the area where it’s applied, giving a subtle “plumping” effect over time.
   * **Non-Invasive**: No needles or surgical procedures required; you just rub it in like any other skincare product.
   * **Potential Multi-Use**: Marketed for various areas—face, bust, butt—wherever you’d like a gentle volume boost.
* **Caveats:**
   * **Limited Clinical Data:** Most evidence comes from brand-sponsored or small-scale studies, so take claims with a grain of salt.
   * **No for me**: I don’t have the patience for a poorly studied topical, with minimal results nor am I perceptive enough.  

# Which one should I choose?

So this frankly comes down to a cost assessment and level of comfortability.

Despite the hate around HA fillers they remain valuable options for volume loss when done by skilled clinicians. I can provide more information on why I am still an advocate for their use, but the complication of ""pillow face"" has some serious factors that contributed that are frequently forgotten about, like overfilling within short periods of time. You wouldn't be doing this.

Regarding Traditional Fat Graft Vs. Renuva

The areas on my face were filled with about 25 cc for the temples, under eyes and cheeks. Granted I got this done in Korea, while I was getting a rhinoplasty, but the cost of the fat grafting there was $3,000-4,000. The cost might be more in the United States.

Now of course not all of that is going to survive so it's overfilled, that 25 cc is not the exact volume that was needed. But to have the first procedure done, I effectively paid the above for the initial inlay. 

Renuva is packaged as 1.5 cc and 3 cc, at about $1,200-2,000 USD for 1.5 cc depending on where you go. Not every provider is going to do this- but my dermatologist is kinda a cowboy and used 1.5 cc EACH for my temples, and I paid $2,400.

So the cost of a full facial rejuvenation using Renuva would end up being more costly than then fat graft- in my case.

Still my example is not great, since the math is so variable. The fat graft surgery would likely have needed a second, I have no idea how much Renuva is actually needed for a full facial rejuvenation- yet it seems to have higher success rates with one injection than the traditional fat graft and thus only one treatment needed. You see the kinda of calculations that would go into something like this...

# Real Science with Journals

Okay here is the real science. I summarized and have collected remaining articles- which you can read like an adult.

“Clinical Evaluation of an Off-the-Shelf Allogeneic Adipose Matrix for Soft Tissue Reconstruction.” [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7015604/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7015604/) 

>Study Design & Methods  
The article presents clinical evaluations, including retrospective analyses or prospective trials. Patients with volume deficiencies received injections of the allogeneic adipose matrix under local anesthesia. Volume retention, aesthetic outcomes, and any side effects or complications were monitored over a defined follow-up period. 

>Efficacy  
The findings suggest noticeable, sustained volume restoration over time. Imaging and clinical assessments show that the matrix integrates with the patient’s own tissue, allowing for a more natural look and feel. Patients reported a high satisfaction rate, indicating that the product delivered the desired aesthetic improvements. Safety & Biocompatibility 

>Adverse events were minimal, mild swelling or bruising. The decellularized nature of the matrix reduces immunogenic response; no severe allergic reactions or transplant rejections were observed. 

>Comparison to Existing Methods  
Unlike autologous fat grafting, no liposuction is required, simplifying the procedure and reducing operating time and surgical risks. Volume retention is reported to be comparable or superior to conventional fat grafting in some cases, depending on technique and patient factors. Offers an “off-the-shelf” solution, eliminating the need for scheduling around a fat-harvesting procedure.

“Preclinical Optimization of a Shelf-Ready, Injectable, Human-Derived, Decellularized Allograft Adipose Matrix.”  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30084731/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30084731/)

>This study focuses on creating and refining a **human-derived, decellularized adipose matrix (DAM)** that can be stored at room or refrigerator temperature and then injected for soft tissue restoration. The authors aim to validate the product’s safety, handling, and efficacy before clinical use, offering a minimally invasive alternative to traditional fat grafting.

>Key Objectives

>**Shelf Stability**: Develop a formulation that remains stable (sterile, structurally intact, and non-immunogenic) without requiring immediate use post-processing.

>**Injectability**: Ensure the matrix can pass smoothly through a fine-gauge needle, facilitating precise placement in target tissues.

>**Biocompatibility**: Confirm minimal inflammatory or immune responses in preclinical models.

>**Volume Retention & Integration**: Assess how well the DAM integrates with host tissues and retains volume over time.

>Key Findings

>**Effective Decellularization**

>**Improved Handling & Stability**

>**Biocompatibility**

>**Volume Retention & Structural Support**

>Conclusions & Implications

>The **preclinical data** support the feasibility of an “off-the-shelf,” **injectable** DAM that can be stored and used when needed—no immediate harvesting or specialized handling required.

>The **favorable biocompatibility** profile suggests it could serve as a promising alternative to traditional autologous fat grafting or synthetic fillers.

>**Further clinical research** is recommended to validate these findings in humans, establish best practices for injection techniques, and confirm long-term safety and efficacy.

>This study highlights how a **shelf-ready, injectable, human-derived DAM** can potentially offer a **convenient and effective** option for soft tissue augmentation, bridging the gap between autologous fat grafting (which is invasive and unpredictable) and synthetic fillers (which may lack natural tissue integration).

**Additional Info**  
- I'm a sysadmin and have few mini pcs as home lab. When they aren't enough I deploy VMs on my gaming PC. While my current 5600x/32gb setup never had a problem, I still wanted to keep CPU cores and RAM high in this new build.

- I dabbled in every single hobby out there. Had cutting edge VR projects as part of an academic project. I regularly use LLMs and Stable Diffusion with my current 3080.  

- Currently my 3080 can't push 4k even with DLSS Performance. I want to change that.


**Additional Questions**  
- I don't know what frequency and latency to choose for RAM. I'm open to suggestions.   
- I'm not sure if I need X870 or B850 or B650 there are so many options. I have 3 nvme drives, so  I guess that's my only requirement. 870/850 ones are around $330, decent B650's are around $220 here.  
- I really don't know what GPU to choose. 5070ti seems like it's at the sweet spot, but then there's LLM stuff. But 5090 isn't worth it since I can buy multiple 3x second hand 3090 + 1x new 5080 instead of 5090.

Thanks in advance.

**PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)**

4k/30 or 1440p 60 Gaming, VR, local stable diffusion or similar AI, home theater, and the option to play around w/ virtual machines/partitions/ and start teaching myself Linux

For storage in my first build I had 4 of these in Raid 0. TBH a friend recommended Raid 0 but idk if it really improved speeds or not because it was such a huge upgrade compared to the family office pc from 2010. I backed up everything on the cloud and a separate hd so idc if eventually the system goes down. SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2.5"" 500GB SATA III 32 layer 3D V-NAND Internal Solid State Drives

I’m thinking that I want 4TB SSD and maybe a smaller 1TB backup for important files. I’m on the fence and persuadable either way as long as I got at least 2Tb for gaming.



**Purchase country? Near Micro Center?**

Japan, specifically Hokkaido so microcenter here. The closest equivalents to a Microcenter would be Dospara or Tsukumo which aren’t far from me. I also have access/familiarity with Amazon Japan, Bic Camera, Yodobashi Camera, and Yamada Denki. I’m open to other places as long as they’re official and legit.



**Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)**

95% of the time it’ll be hooked to a 50in 4k in the living room BUT I’m thinking about adding a separate 2 monitor setup 1 horizontal for video and one vertical for reading or just one curved on a desk in a different room. The desk space is 80x47cm



**Budget range? (Include tax considerations)**

About 2-3k USD if I include savings, and a credit card, and me setting aside about 20,000 yen (126) per month over the course of a year but importantly I’m in no rush and want to try and get a decent deal on futureproof parts. 



**WiFi or wired connection?**

My apartment can only handle wifi but I’d at least like the option for ethernet should I ever move.



**Size/noise constraints?**

I specifically want a large tower and a motherboard that are futureproofed to handle upgrades. I used to have liquid cooling via a pretty easy to use DEEPCOOL GENOME II case and I definitely want it to run silent and basically never hear a fan regardless of what I’m doing.



**Color/lighting preferences?**

Looking for a black case with green light (basically building off classic Xbox and Splinter Cell colors). It’s important for me that I can turn off or dim the colors. I don’t want to blind myself late at night.



**Any other specific needs?**

\*95% of its use will be in a living room but I also want to somehow use it in my bedroom for a 1 to 2 monitor setup with a webcam for when I have meetings and/or give presentations online. I’m debating whether I should snake a really long cable on the outskirts of the rooms or figure out a wireless option that won’t cause lag issues. The PC location will be about is about 460cm away from the desk.



**Current laptop/hometheater setup**

\*In 2019 I bought a MSI P65 Creator 9SE-472JP and use it daily as an extension of my life. I carry it with me all hours of the day to work, to teach, to browse, and to watch videos. I used to use it for gaming but after a fan issue that locals refused to fix I rarely use it for gaming anymore b/c of the prohibitive cost of a replacement for the fan which isn’t manufactured anymore. I took the laptop apart and cleaned the fan myself and thankfully it generally runs ok but one fan in particular is still sus from time to time so I generally don’t use it for any kind of modern gaming and picked up a Series X just before the price increase over here in JP. 

When I get home I connect my laptop to my 4k TV and watch youtube, netflix, ect and control it with a K400 Plus Wireless Touch Keyboard which is sufficient for navigation. I only use an Xbox Series X controller for gameplay. I’ve tried M&K in the past but my arms can’t handle it for long periods of time (carpal tunnel/tennis elbow/ect) I have a meta quest 2 that I used to do VR on and I’m thinking about getting a new VR set in the next 5 years.

(specs here: [https://jp.msi.com/Content-Creation/P65-Creator-9SX/Specification](https://jp.msi.com/Content-Creation/P65-Creator-9SX/Specification))

\*I’m considering buying a used GPU just to get the PC running early and then upgrading from there. The catch is I don’t ever want to downgrade in terms of GPU. My first pc build had a 1060 and I’ve been using a 6gb RTX 2060 in my laptop since 2019. 



**I also have some basic questions for those who don’t mind.**

Regarding upgrades should I really focus on the best possible CPU up front? I’m mainly worried about the difficulty of swapping cpus and dealing w/ thermal paste. I built a pc before but moved before reapplying thermal paste or swapping the cpu ever became an issue.

I’ve been studying Japanese since high school and I’m currently in J302. My school has a exchange program with Waseda University and I plan on doing my entire Junior year abroad there in Tokyo. Following graduation I’m planning on pursuing the JET programs CIR position and either living in Japan or trying to land a job where I can work both in Japan and the US with an international company. My current plan is of course subject to change but I want to establish a stable financial footing in Japan and I want to start early. I currently have about 1.3K USD in cryptocurrency, $500 in the S&P 500 which I’m working to contribute to monthly and a savings account with about $2K in it. I’ve been building credit in the US but I’m curious about what are some of the best ways for foreigners to build credit Japan? Is there anything I can do currently or ideas I can keep in the back of my mind? What are some of the easiest entry points given my position and being outside of Japan? And are there any banks or credit card companies I should be taking a look at? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I would love to hear any personal experiences or pitfalls some of you may have encountered starting your financial journeys in Japan.

[SELF] A Response to the Avatar/Unobtanium Post,theydidthemath,1hvytma,2025-01-07 13:54:28,9,0.91,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/1hvytma/self_a_response_to_the_avatarunobtanium_post/,DaLB53,,"Hello all. Since my answer wasn't able to be added to[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/1hvmcad/request_how_expensive_must_unobtanium_be_per/) about the economic realities of the Avatar Universe, and since I don't want all my work to go to waste, I figured I would make my own response post.

The question, posed by u/Repulsive_Lime_359, (all credit to them for a great question) was *""**How expensive must Unobtanium be per kilogram to justify mining it on Pandora and shipping it back to Earth?""* and i have attempted to answer the basic economics of the energy needs of the interstellar travel in that movie compared to the described value of Unobtanium.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: I am not a mathematician, an astronomer, a supply-chain manager, or really an expert in anything. But I do have a bunch of Adderall pumping through me and not much to do at work, so imma give this a shot.**

**Things we Know:**

* Unobtanium ""sells for 20 million a kilo"" back on earth. We are going to assume this means $20,000,000 USD. Notice this is unrefined, and ""sells for $40 million per kilogram refined on earth"".

* Unobtanium is *usually* refined on Pandora, as unrefined Unobtanium is not only incredibly dangerous to handle (or even be nearby) for humans, it also will carry a significant amount of waste elements that diminish its value and will need to be disposed of once back on Earth. For this exercise, we will be using the refined model of unobtanium.

* The ISV *Venture Star* is capable of carrying 350 tons of cargo. A fully loaded *Venture Star* can carry, assuming its fully loaded, $14,000,000,000 (14 billion) USD worth of unobtanium.

* The *Venture Star* has a 13.5 year total round-trip time, of which only one way (headed towards Earth) would yield a profit. That results in (roughly) 964,000,000 dollars per operating year for the voyage.

**Things we Can Assume:**

* For this model we are assuming that $40M is the *gross* profit, before the operating expenses of a massive interstellar commerce operation are considered.

* Outside of disruptions caused by Jake Sully and the Na'vi, we don't have any reason to believe that there are significant logistics issues with Unobtanium transportation, so we can assume that operating costs are generally stable across ISV ships and shipments.

* On Earth in the 21st Century, Rare Earth Mineral mining operations generally operate within a 20%-30% operating margin, assuming the market is stable. Since Earth in 2140 is a one-world federation, we can assume that things like market prices (especially for the most critical mineral in the world) are stable as well.

**Step 1: Getting to Pandora:** To the OP's first point, the ship, the ISV *Venture Star* is an interstellar transportation vessel used to A) take people, resources, and equipment to Pandora and B). Return to Earth with Unobtanium. There are 10 ships in the ISV fleet of similar makeup on a continuous loop between Pandora and Earth.

It is primarily driven (particularly in its initial acceleration to .7 of the speed of light) with massive orbital lasers which push along an enormous 16 kilometer photon sail, which then drags the rest of the 1.5 kilometer ship behind it. While we don't have an exact modern day comparative, we can reference *The Flight of the Dragonfly* by Dr. Robert Forward who had a similar idea for a design, using a battery of ""1,000 laser stations around mercury, generating a 1.5 terawatt beam each (1500TW of energy total, which is orders of magnitude larger than the entire planet used in electricity in 2008). This is for a ship, in Forward's novel, that is significantly smaller than the VS and moving 150x slower. Suffice it to say, these need to be some seriously big-ass lasers.

Using a whole bunch of google-fu, it can be determined:

The total energy required to propel the ship can be determined as:

* **Power Required:** P=F/6.7​=7.35 x 10^(8) N/6.7 ​≈1.096×10^(8) GW.      

   * Converted to watts = **10****^(17)** **Watts**

* **Force Required:** F=5×10^(7)kg⋅14.7m/s^(2) = **7.35×10****^(8)** **Newtons**.

* **Energy Required:** E=1.096×10^(17) W⋅14,501,760s ≈**1.59×10****^(24)****J.**

   * Converting joules to kilowatt-hours (1kWh = 3.6 x 10^(6) J) = **4.42×10****^(17)****kWh.**

* **Cost of Energy:** 4.42 x 10^(17) kWh x $0.10 = **4.42x10****^(16)** **USD**

**In Conclusion:** To propel the ISV *Venture Star* at an estimated gross tonnage of 50,000 metric tons to .7 the speed of light in .46 of a year (167 days), assuming a standard $.10/kilowatt hour, NOT including the cost of the infrastructure or energy production required comes out to a cool (drum roll)...

**44.2 Quadrillion US Dollars.**

Comparing that to the maximum potential yield of any given cargo run of unobtanium being roughly 14 *billion* US dollars, the RDA would need to run **3,157,143 total missions** to reach 44.2 quadrillion dollars.

If they dispatched each ship at even intervals, so every 1.35 years, so there would be a continuous, regular interval of departures and deliveries, it would take the ISV fleet **2,122,026** years to complete every trip necessary to pay for ONE laser battery operation.

Or, more simply put, an entire load of unobtanium sold for 14 billion USD would cover 3.17 x 10^(-7) of the operating costs of a single trip.

**Arriving at Pandora**

Since there is not a similar battery of orbital lasers around Pandora to reverse-accelerate the ship, the ISV *Venture Star* uses matter/antimatter annihilation generators to either slow down or accelerate away from Pandora.

There is VERY little actual information about hydrogen/antihydrogen annihilation outside of theories, however since we are trying to determine *cost* we can go off the Project Icarus estimation of the cost of 1 milligram of antimatter as being 100 Billion USD. This is in the modern day where they capturing of antimatter is measured in milliseconds at best (the record for antimatter capture was just over 1,000 seconds at CERN in 2011). **Disclaimer: There is no reason to think that our current estimation of the cost of antimatter (widely regarded as the most expensive ""thing"" conceived by man) would be the same in 2140, I'm only working with numbers that are available to me.**

To determine how much antihydrogen is needed to stop the *Venture Spirit,* again assuming a 50,000 metric ton mass travelling at .7 the speed of light in .46 of a year (167ish days) you:

Determine the kinetic energy of the ship using E=1/2mv^(2) where m is the mass (50,000,000 in kg) and v is the velocity (0.7 x 3 x 10^(8) m/s)

* **KE = 1.1 x 10****^(24)** **J** of energy

Then simply divide the ships kinetic energy against our known energy per milligram of hydrogen/antihydrogen annihilation

* 1.1 x 10^(24) / 1.8 x 10^(11) = 6.1 x 10^(12) milligrams, or **6,100,000 kilograms of antihydrogen**

Going off of our modern understanding of antimatter and its costs in todays dollars, this results in 6.1 x 10^(17 ,) ***or 6.1 QUINTILLION USD*****.** 

This positively absurd volume obviously also completely throws our calculations of a 50,000 metric ton ship out the window, doubly so because you would need an exact equal amount of *actual* hydrogen as part of the process. And notice as well that this would need to be doubled *again* to get the ship back going hurtling towards earth.

**DISCLAIMER AGAIN:** This assumes a TON of stuff, like energy production and costs in 2140, the net and gross value of unobtanium, the global GDP of Earth, the resources or internationalization of the RDA and their funding. Obviously, this version of earth is *capable* of creating these massive things and expending these vast resources (though the exploitation of Pandora is evidence enough that we have already sucked the Earth dry by this point, but I digress).

I also, again, am not a mathematician and used a lot of google for the calculations here, so take it or leave it.

**TL;DR: The energy, material, and financial costs of getting one of these ships to Pandora and back are dozens of orders of magnitude higher than the yield of any conceivable amount of shipments of unobtanium, and this is all** ***without*** **calculating anything like the mining or refining process, human factors, energy generation and infrastructure, ship maintenance, and additional market and supply chain infrastructure costs on Earth.**

I studied for 4 years at a military academy to become an army officer. I graduated, worked for 5 years, and almost 2 years ago, I requested unpaid leave to travel. I came to Australia on a Working Holiday Visa and have been fortunate enough to travel to various parts of Australia, Asia, Europe, and Arab countries. This experience awakened a passion in me for traveling, exploring cultures, places, and meeting people.

In the army, I had an average salary—not the best nor the worst (around $2,100 USD / €2,000 per month)—but enough to live comfortably. Additionally, it comes with benefits like affordable healthcare, retirement after 20 years of service, and a stable income. I could work until I’m 42 and retire with a lifetime pension of $2,000 USD per month, something almost impossible in the civilian world.

However, the job has its challenges: at times, the environment is toxic, there are no fixed schedules, night shifts are common, and professional life constantly overlaps with personal life (living in military areas where you’re surrounded by superiors and subordinates 24/7). It’s an all-consuming job with its pros and cons like any other.

Now, I’m facing a major decision: should I return to the army or resign to keep traveling? My unpaid leave is about to end, and if I decide not to return, I’d be giving up a career that took me 4 years of study and effort to build. Moreover, I can’t just “find another army” like someone in a civilian career might find another job—I’d have to start from scratch.

Resigning would mean betting everything on a life of adventure. I’d love to explore Southeast Asia for several months and continue discovering the world while I’m young. I believe traveling in your 20s and 30s is different than doing so later in life: you have more energy, meet peers in hostels, go partying, hike, and your priorities are different. On the other hand, there’s the uncertainty of what my life would look like when I get “tired” of traveling and want to settle down.

The other option is to return to the army, sacrifice another 11–12 years of my life, and secure a comfortable, stable pension for life. This would allow me to travel when I’m older, but it wouldn’t feel the same.

I know there are pros and cons to both decisions. Sometimes I enjoy my career, other times I hate it. That’s why I’d love to hear from people who have faced similar choices:

* Has anyone here chosen stability and a secure life, giving up a dream for a comfortable and financially stable future?

COOLER - Cooler Master Hyper 212


MOTHERBOARD - ASRock B650M


MEMORY - Corsair Vengeance 16 Gb


GPU - Radeon RX 7600 XT 16GB


PSU - Cooler Master MWE Gold 850




My general concern with what I'm building is longevity and minimising upgrades by just shelling out more money for a better component now. I intend on purchasing a second stick of ram maybe a few months from now and maybe a better cooler even later. 


I typically spend most of my time playing single player games like Cyberpunk, Forza and Dying light, Genshin, minecraft etc. and sometimes multiplayer games like Marvel Rivals, Valorant. I already have a 1080p 144hz monitor but would like to switch to an 1440p Oled monitor eventually and was hoping that when the time comes I can comfortably play my single player games on High settings stable 1660p 60fps. I currently have a laptop that's been shitting itself but could squeeze a somewhat stable 45-55fps on Cyberpunk but through lowering my graphics all the way down and was just hoping I could avoid that experience honestly.

I considered a RX 7800 XT instead, but in my country the price difference between those would roughly boil down to $200 USD and the motherboard being a B650 Gaming being an alternative but I picked the M varient due to the ports honestly. It's a first PC build for me and was just wondering if I missed out on anything wgile selecting my parts. Thanks in advance.

Should I move forward? ,Arrangedmarriage,1hu4rhv,2025-01-05 06:09:45,1,0.56,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1hu4rhv/should_i_move_forward/,Ok-Sector-3373,Seeking Advice,"Apologies in advance for the long post:

I am 36 yo (M) NRI in US met this girl 28 Yo from Canada on matrimonial site. She seemed attractive in the pics first but during video call she was way overweight, and didn't seem like the pics. I moved past that fixation, because our vibe has been good.

I am a non IT engineer and make about 135K/yr USD and she has a bachelor's degree in an Arts field from Canadian university, and was in a non technical field job. Like a team leader, making about 70K/yr canadian.

I feel we have a good vibe, and she said she was supportive and understanding of my life challenges.

She came to see me the first time for a week within 3 months of us talking And we had a good time, I took her on a vacation. I expresses my feelings for her, and shared my concerns about her health and lifestyle. She assured me she's going to work on it. Wake up in time. (go to the gym) etc. And improve her lifestyle. 

Fast forward many months, she was going to the gym etc. Training with a trainer, but not fully disciplined. we met again She even came to Europe to support me (on her expense) for a prestigious technical conference i was asked to come present two papers at. This really made me feel that she cares. Granted it was a vacation for her too and we saw around in Europe.

My concerns still were her career and lifestyle. I had suggested her to prioritize getting into a graduate school program in Canada since we met. Because I was not confident if her career/job is stable. And to also work on her lifestyle, health etc.

Fast forward almost 9 months, she loses her job. Gets laid off. And it's been 4 months and she can't find another job. The only job she could find is retail or so. And she works one. 

And the progress on her lifestyle and health wasn't remarkable, where I felt that someone was truly disciplined or committed about it.

She had insisted, that she came to US many times but I never went to Canada. 
I recently met her family, in Canada. And they were quite warm and welcoming. But i feel that the underlying concerns between me and her are still unresolved. And I feel that she is quite non-challant about her career and health. I even mentioned this to her mother. And me being older (almost 37, lack of options as NRI in US and age) , and living the challenging life on H1B etc. Taking care of an elderly mother by myself who lives with me. Unsure if I can proceed forward.

I have had deep feelings for her. But I am afraid of the patterns I see, should I commit and move forward? I still want this to work. But I am just afraid.

I was afraid to post this, but I am hopeful I could have some clarity.   "

I already have a comfortable life prior to migrating. I have my own place, car, I can fund my hobbies and travels. I have a stable job. Now, I’m back to zero and I have to start all over again here. I don’t have a job yet and I’m sharing a room with my mom which is a big privacy issue. 

Previous Attempts:
My questions are
- What are the repercussions if I don’t continue my Green Card? Will I have a hard time getting a tourist visa If I ever want to travel to US again?
- My mom wanted me to go here bcs of the healthcare facilities - but the problem is, it’s 10x more expensive than in PH. At least in the PH I have HMO
- Rent is super expensive because we are in California
- I’ve just been here for more than a week and my mental health is already declining (I miss my old life and my dogs!), is this really worth it? 
- The only pros that I can think of are: having a stronger passport and same sex marriage (yes, I’m wlw! and I want to marry my girlfriend hehe) + maybe I can save more here considering the USD Rate?
- PS. We don’t plan on having children so, we don’t need to save for anything, really
- Another mental health struggle if I stay here is being LDR, I have to wait for around 5 years (to process her papers) to be with my girlfriend again for good.

Set It and Forget It: My Long-Term ETF Portfolio - Am I missing something?,ETFs,1htikb5,2025-01-04 11:51:25,3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1htikb5/set_it_and_forget_it_my_longterm_etf_portfolio_am/,ParticularSuccess562,,"I’m a Swiss-based investor, and I’m going all-in on a simple, passive, long-term ETF strategy. We’re talking 10+ years, with max diversification and zero stress. No complicated tinkering, no robo-advisors etc. because I don’t see how those are gonna beat the global equity market over the long run.

My Portfolio:

**Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (Dist)**  
Why:

* It’s global: covers both developed and emerging markets.
* Built-in rebalancing, so it adjusts weights for me as the markets do their thing (like if the US lags, it naturally reduces on the US).
* Physical replication keeps tracking errors in check.
* Super low costs, and it trades in USD/CHF, which keeps currency risks manageable.

**iShares Core SPI ETF (CH)**  
Why:

* Gives me that Swiss market exposure: stable and no currency risk.
* Complements my global play with a local hedge.

**Why This Combo?**

* Diversification: Global reach with Vanguard, local anchoring with SPI.
* Auto-risk management: Vanguard’s rebalancing takes care of regional fluctuations, while SPI keeps me grounded.
* Stupid-simple setup with minimal fees.

**Goals & Chill:**

* Reinvest all dividends
* Targeting 5–7% on the global side and 3–5% in Switzerland.
* Let Vanguard’s All-World ETF do the heavy lifting with its auto-rebalancing

I don’t think there’s a lazier, more optimized way to long-term investing without investing much time.

That happened with Argentina, which due to a financial crisis and the very low price of the argentinian Peso recently, it became a cheap place to go with less money than usual

That being said, for someone without a deep economical knowledge, it is common to associate low-valued currencies to countries with a bad financial situation (Bolivia, Venezuela, Argentina are good examples to illustrate what i’m saying). 

But that logic stops making sense when we bring in some examples like the swedish crown, japanese yen, chinese yuan. All those countries are a thousand times more stable economically speaking, but their currency are still cheaper than the Real. What’s the reason behind that?"

Thank you in advance to any and all who take the time to respond. If you’re a fellow professional cook or a home cook who uses the hell out of their knives, please let me know in your comment, but I’m very open to advice from all. 

This will absolutely be a well used tool, but I enjoy appreciating the skill and craft that goes into a blade if I end up going in a more handmade route. "
Gold ETF's as diversification,BEFire,1hrww2o,2025-01-02 10:57:47,36,0.93,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/BEFire/comments/1hrww2o/gold_etfs_as_diversification/,go_go_tindero,Investing,"What is the effect of gold on portfolio diversification ? A medium deep dive.

Suppose your name is Tessa, and you want to diversify a bit, how would you do it? One possibility is buying a gold transmutation machine, and start producing gold. Also land, and maybe options or some Turbo ETF's. Who knows ?

The other, slightly cheaper solution, is to buy gold.

Basically there are two possible reasons why want to own gold.

* You think the collapse of the world is imminent
* You think it's a nice addition to your portfolio to reduce volatility

# The Goldbug Mythology

Goldbugs are the financial equivalent of Anuna Dewever and have strong links to other millennialist ideologies. This phenomenon is not confined to gold alone; a similar mindset can be observed in (part of) the bitcoin community, preppers, esoteric nazism and other religious groups. The core belief revolves around the conviction that the global economy is on the brink of collapse. The big reset ! Currency Wars ! The financial endgame is nigh! To prepare for a post-apocalyptic world where fiat currencies and digital transactions lose all value, the true goldbug believes in securing their wealth in physical gold. The idea of being poor again is less bearable than the idea of the end of the world.

For these individuals, no ETF or financial derivative will suffice. They insist on holding tangible assets—coins and bars—stored securely in their homes. This approach often comes with additional preparations for survival. To take this to it's extreme, your checklist typically includes firearms for protection, a substantial stockpile of canned food, and a reliable water supply. To further ensure survival, a well-stocked reserve of antibiotics is deemed essential, as access to medical supplies could become scarce in their envisioned dystopia. Preferably this is all held in the Ardennes or a scarcely populated region in order to fight off the zombies/Russians/Belgian state/AI army/Alien invasion.

If, however, you are less inclined to believe that the end of the world is imminent, financial solutions such as gold ETFs or other investment vehicles might suffice for your needs. These options provide exposure to the gold market without the logistical and security concerns associated with storing physical gold. While they may not fit the goldbug’s survivalist mythology, they offer a practical alternative for investors seeking to hedge against economic uncertainty.

# Gold is a Pretty Bad Financial Asset

Starting from 09/2009 (I don’t know why IWDA isn’t in my Bloomberg terminal before this date), gold has had a return of 6.05% (CAGR), while IWDA has returned 10.15% per year. Thanks to the wonders of compound interest, this 4% difference is absolutely massive. For example, USD 100,000 invested in IWDA would grow to USD 437,000 (why USD? Because I exported the data from Bloomberg in USD and I’m too lazy to switch to EUR; returns in EUR would be even higher) compared to just USD 244,000 in gold over the same period.

Boo! You suck gold !

Gold also performs poorly on a ‘simple Sharpe’ basis (using a risk-free rate of zero, again because of laziness). The volatility of gold is 0.21 compared to 0.18 for IWDA, and this is with a significantly lower return. The simple Sharpe ratio of gold (return/volatility) is 0.29, whereas for IWDA it is 0.54.

So, why do people buy gold?

Because gold often moves in the opposite direction of stocks. This negative correlation can make it a useful tool for portfolio diversification. In times of economic uncertainty or market downturns, gold’s perceived status as a ‘safe haven’ asset can provide some stability. That said, if your primary goal is long-term wealth accumulation, gold’s inferior returns and higher volatility make it a suboptimal choice compared to equities like IWDA.

# No rebalancing

If we would make a portfolio of 20% gold, 80% IWDA  in 09/2009 and just don't trade anything until today, this would result in a return of 9,5%, slightly lower compared to pure IWDA, but with a vol of 0,16 and a simple sharpe of 0,57 !

This is better ! It's slightly less return of a lot less volatility. The wonders of finance. Note tt's less return though.

# With rebalancing

With rebalancing it get's even better. rebalacing is taking a reoccuring moment and 'rebalance' your portfolio to its original target. So for instance if you have 20% in gold, and 80% in stock, in a year where you stocks decrease with 15%, and your gold increase with 10%, you will end up with 75.5% in stocks and 24.4% in gold. So you sell 18.1% of you gold holdings and buy stocks, so you end up with 80-20 again.

When to do this ? you choose a random date, the more random the better (eg pref. not at quarter end)

How often ? yearly is enough.

Doing this with a 20/80 portfolio would result in 9.7% CAGR and 0.61 simple sharpe. A lot better than a pure IWDA portfolio in terms of risk/return. Still less good in terms of return.

# What is the optimal amount ?

It depends on what you are maximizing. If you want to maximize returns, it's 0%. If you want to maximize simple sharpe, the amount is quite high, between 25-30%.

Note this is only based on historical prices and gold doesn't have any intrinsic value.

# should I do this ?

Probably not. The differences are so minor that it’s all in the realm of financial masturbation. You’d be better off taking a walk, enjoying hobbies, or spending time with family. Why are you even reading this? Go play with your kids. Soon they’ll head off to study in Leuven, and before you know it, you’ll be staring out the window at Christmas, wondering where the time has gone. When did you become so fat?

# But how do gold ETF's work ?

There are a number of different types of Gold-ETF's.

Gold ETF's try to mimic the price evolution of gold. This can be done in several ways, which have there own advantages and disadvantages.

Also note that the AUM of bitcoin ETF's are larger than that of Gold ETF's.

Below ranked from not so risky to maybe not.

# Physical Gold-Backed ETFs

* Structure: These ETFs are backed by physical gold bullion stored in secure vaults, usually in the US, London or Switzerland. Some funds make a big deal out of the yearly audit, and you can come and look at gold bars yourself.
* Mechanism: Each share typically represents a specific amount of physical gold
* Advantages:
   * Direct exposure to gold prices.
   * Seen as the most transparent and secure way to invest in gold ETFs.
* Examples:
   * Most ETF's fall under this category nowadays. Look for physical in the title, but most large ETF's are fine. Invesco, Ishares, Van Eyck, all fine. When in doubt, read the KID.
   * SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)
   * iShares Gold Trust (IAU)

Key Considerations:

* Storage fees are passed on to investors in the form of an expense ratio which can be quite high.
* Limited to movements in the spot price of gold.
* No Reynders Tax

# Gold-Linked ETFs (Synthetic or Replicated)

* Structure: Use derivatives such as swaps or contracts to replicate the price of gold without holding the physical metal. Typically these are called ETN or ETC and not strictly ETF
* Mechanism: The ETF enters agreements with counterparties (a  bank) to mimic gold's price movements. This is a strictly contractual relationship, although the bank has to keep some collateral (which might not be gold). If the bank goed bankrupt, this instrument is also worth 0 (note that this exist for stocks as wel)
* Advantages:
   * Lower costs than physical gold ETFs.
* Examples: Some less popular or regional ETFs may adopt this structure. DE000TMG0LD6 is one for instance
* Key Considerations:
   * Counterparty risk, as the value depends on the reliability of the derivatives issuer.
   * I have no idea how these work with the Reynders tax.

# Gold Futures-Based ETFs

* Structure: Invest in gold futures contracts rather than physical gold.
* Mechanism: These ETFs trade contracts that specify the future delivery of gold at a set price.
* Advantages:
   * Can provides leveraged exposure to gold prices.
   * Often used by short-term traders or for hedging.
* Examples:
* ProShares Ultra Gold (leveraged exposure to gold prices).
* Key Considerations:
* May not precisely track spot prices due to the ""roll yield"" or costs associated with rolling over contracts.
* Higher risk and volatility compared to physical-backed ETFs.

# Gold Mining ETFs

* Structure: Invest in shares of gold mining companies rather than gold itself.
* Mechanism: These ETFs provide indirect exposure to gold prices, as mining companies' profitability correlates with gold prices.
* Advantages:
   * Potentially higher returns during bullish gold markets, as miners offer operational leverage.
   * Diversified exposure to multiple companies.
* Examples:
   * VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX)
   * iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (RING)
* Key Considerations:
* Indirect exposure to gold prices.
* Additional risks tied to company management, operational costs, and geopolitical factors.

# Gold Royalty and Streaming ETFs

* Structure: Invest in companies that finance gold miners in exchange for a share of future production or royalties. Literally can't go tits up.
* Mechanism: Exposure to companies benefiting from stable cash flows tied to gold production.
* Advantages:
   * Diversification across multiple mining projects.
   * Lower operational risk than direct mining companies.
* Examples:
   * Global X Gold Explorers ETF (GOEX)
* Key Considerations:
   * Limited correlation to spot gold prices.
   * Risks depend on the financial health of the mining projects financed."
What is the long term function of XRP?,XRP,1hri8zp,2025-01-01 20:32:56,10,0.65,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRP/comments/1hri8zp/what_is_the_long_term_function_of_xrp/,officialqdoba,Ripple,"As I understand it, XRP is designed to be the solution to sending cross border payments quickly. However, with RLUSD, would this not be a better coin if you were a bank converting different currencies to crypto, as being pegged to the USD is a more stable environment for money in transit?

If RLUSD becomes the cross border currency, does this not relegate XRP to being only the “gas” used to keep the XRPL from being spammed to oblivion? Or on the other hand, does RLUSD become the missing key to using XRP to change the entire way the world moves money?

"No, I don't think any other company can catch MSTR due to supply shock. It is math ",MSTR,1hrbrum,2025-01-01 15:32:22,131,0.93,93,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrbrum,the_ats,Bullish 📈,"I've seen the comments. 'Others can do it better or bigger'. I don't think so. This post is going to look at a few things on both the supply and demand side. I've included the relevant images up top for explanations. There's a bit of rambling to get to my table at the bottom, but ultimately I think the key to understanding why other companies can't do what MSTR has done has to do with decreased flow and decreased Exchange Reserves.

450 BTC are mined daily roughly there are 172654 blocks in il March 2028 when the reward will be reduced from 3.125 to 1.5625.

That means there are only 540k new Btc up for grabs over the next 39 months.

That is split between all HODL miners, all DCA people, all ETFs and Pensions, all Sovereign wealth funds, etc. will some be selling? Sure. People retire. People need operating costs etc. debts will need to be serviced.

But MSTR already owns the equivalent of  80% of all new BTC through the next Halfing. 

The following 4 years will see a reduction of daily productions of new coins to roughly 225.

The price of BTC must go up If the demand growth is 0%.

But the demand growth is not 0%. As you can see the BTC inflows of ETFs has been steady. The only outflows were GBTC to the others, mainly. Total on chain holdings grew from 600k BTC to 1,170k BTC, or doubled, in a year. 

This steadily accelerated in q3 and  q4. The overall yearly average was 570k over 365 days or 1560 BTC per day of the year. 

The demand outstripped new supply by over 3.4:1 and the price basically has increased 300%.

If demand in 2025 matches q4, which saw ETFs grow from 950k to 1.170 
Million, or 220,000 BTC in 90 days, or 2440 BTC per day, representing an over 5.4:1 demand vs Supply.

And once the election was over, we saw the acquisition grow from 1.03 to 1.17 million, or 140,000 BTC in 53 days a 5.8:1.

My point is this, stock to flow is a real thing. When considering MSTR prices, of course diluting with shares will suppress the price due to an increase of stock to flow. That isn't news to anyone.

But the first mover advantage will be impossible for anyone to overcome. The primary reason is that the supply of available coins is shrinking. No one is going to buy every new BTC for the next 35 months to catch up to MSTR because MSTR is also going to buying whenever they can. There is another supply of coins, however.

Exchanges hold millions of coins. An increase in exchange reserves indicates an appetite for trading away BTC for USD or Altcoins. A decrease indicates the opposite.

Exchange held supply is low. In fact it is near all time lows.  This is important because this is where the purchases happen. Saylor himself said they buy through Coinbase, for example. Someone removed 30,000 BTC at 17:00-18:00 EST on New Year's Eve. Since the election, Exchange balances have dropped from 2.43 million to 2.21 million. 

I've not modeled the numbers yet, and the correlation isn't perfectly stable but rather more like milestones and shifting gears, but over the last year, we can observe that:
2,700,000 ER : 40,000 USD
2,600,000 ER: 60,000 USD
2,500,000 ER: 70,000 USD
2,400,000 ER: 80,000 USD
2,300,000 ER: 100,000 USD (If linear, should have been 90k?)
2.210,000 ER: 93,000 USD (might correct back to 100k?)

I wouldn't expect a purely linear relationship. It's more akin to every 10% reduction in ER there is about an 50% increase in USD value. It isn't 1 to 1 but for the same of discussion since election day, we've seen a 210,000 drop in ER in fairly linear fashion.

Funnily enough, MSTR had 279,420 BTC right after the election and has 446,400 now. They are responsible for 166,980 of the 210,000. They accounted for 80% of the market move, that is to say.  

Not every new BTC gets moved to an exchange to sell. We've already established that production cannot meet the needs of the demand.

If y=mx+b and y represents the ER with a B of 2.2 million and m represents a rate of change -4000 BTC per day, represented by X, we can see that in 550 days, there would be no more BTC on the exchanges at the current rate of depletion.

If 100% of the BTC mined is sold, then for the current cycle, an additional 540,000 BTC can be acquired meaning 685 days, or just shy of 2 years, is what is left before there is no more BTC for anyone.

This assumes no strategic BTC Reserve. It assumes the rate started at the election continues.

A more conservative estimate for predicting depletion would go ahead and assume all mined coins are sold and look at the slower rate of change from January to now instead of of November.

That's 1400BTC per day.  Offsetting the 540k BTC and the current ER, that means the 2.740 million BTC. Would last 1957 days, or 5 years. 

There's an obvious cap on price movement at some point, but how many times can you reduce the Exchange Reserves by 10%? Quite a lot.  I'm going to chart our the first 10 time. BTC USD is equal to 95000 at the current Exchange Reserve level.

Rate of change will be tabulated for 950 on the conservative side, assuming 450 BTC makes it way to be sold on the exchanges daily, and 4000 on the bull side, assuming miners HODL.Can happen quick, like the 30,000 that left yesterday evening, or slower.

What goals should I set if I plan on moving out at 18? ,Advice,1hn6r2b,2024-12-26 23:21:48,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hn6r2b/what_goals_should_i_set_if_i_plan_on_moving_out/,Equivalent-Chance-29,,"Edit: Objectives. Measuring objectives is what I meant. Also: this would be a permanent move, I have my motivations set, a realistic income and also that my money situation could be worse by 15-25%. Just to be realistic! 🥲 I do have a good bit of money saved up and I’ve got a few years until I’m 18. Things could change, I know, but this is my decision. 
 
I’ve thought about this for a while. I’ve been preparing myself for when the moment comes, and after some things happened between my parents & sister I decided I’m going to go through with it. I am so much more than thankful with my parents. I don’t mean to leave them alone but because of some things I want out. I’d like to get myself stable and then have my mom live comfortably on her own. I really hope to succeed for myself, and for her.

 I’ve done the math, I’ve built connections, have resumes made, a goal of 58,920 USD I’m working towards before I’m 18 so that I can be comfortable for a while, I manage the documents I can handle as some aren’t in my possession, I’ve got everything I need written down: insurance info, phone numbers, addresses, USCIS info, etc… I update all my data every few months to make sure everything is up to date with documents & my contacts. Savings account (with my sister as the co-owner, my grandma told me not to let my parents have access to my money 🥲),opening a high-yield savings account when I can, budgeting, knowing I need to build credit, all that.

I’d like to go to the military and go to college at the same time. I know sometimes there’s issues with time & that the military can interfere with my education if it is deemed necessary in a mission, however I’ve learned that’s very rarely the case. I’m still sorting out all my student stuff, but I have taken the approach of maintaining a great gpa, extracurriculars, and classes to facilitate that for me. Since I was in 7th grade I’ve had this in mind, and I’ve been trying to stay focused due to such. 

I have basic goals & contacts, I make sure to work on my writing skills as well, communication skills, financial literacy, I make sure to work out and work on my mental health to keep myself balanced, have basic skills that are well-proportioned such as cooking, cleaning, etiquette, etc… but my question is what other goals do I need and what else do I need to prepare for? I know I’ll learn along the way but it’s better to be safe than sorry. Thank you so much. Anyone who’s been in my position it’d be great to hear your story. "

I’m a 26-year-old video editor with 4 years of experience specializing in short-form content and highly converting ads. I’ve worked with hundreds of clients on Fiverr and delivered consistently high-quality results.

I’m considering moving to Qatar to pursue a stable, well-paying job. I’d love to hear from you about:

1. How easy is it for a video editor to find a job in Qatar?


2. What’s the typical salary range for video editing or similar creative roles?


3. How much should I expect to spend monthly (in USD) for essentials like rent, food, and transportation?

"ABYG, if I’m spending less time with my paternal grandmother because she looks down on my mom and her ancestral house even though nakikitira lang lola ko sa bahay namin aa bakasyon?",AkoBaYungGago,1hinvti,2024-12-20 11:44:28,3,0.67,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AkoBaYungGago/comments/1hinvti/abyg_if_im_spending_less_time_with_my_paternal/,stardustmilk,Family,"

Dad (60): family grew up POOR (walked to school barefoot cause they couldn’t buy slippers, he was always extremely thin until his mom finally had a stable job when my dad was in high school). Got a 6-digit salary for the first time in his life once he turned 60 this year. Hindi maluho at hindi ako tinitipid pag gutom ako, etc.

PL (80): paternal lola (hindi Philip Laude), dad’s mom. Sole provider for her kids cause her husband used to gamble even though they were dirt poor. Di siya nakapagtapos ng high school and worked odd jobs, even when she migrated. Migrated to the US maybe four decades ago and usually vacations in the Philippines once a year. The past 2 years, she’s stayed in our ancestral home even though she has kore than $1M USD of savings in her bank account (she showed me the balance herself sa app niya.) 

Sobrang matampuhin niya and she usually prefers being with her sons (both live in the PH) cause her daughters call her out for always going to casinos. 

Mom (61): Born and raised in a burgis family, not book-smart like her siblings but extremely street smart. Her grandpa was the former mayor of our city, which is why our family is well-respected in the area. She stopped working when I was a kid kasi gusto niyang maging hands-on sa akin at hindi lang ako alagaan ng yaya. My dad’s salary for as long as I remember was only ₱30k ish a month, e they sent me to a private school from nursery to high school. Because of that, my mom never really bought anything for herself (clothes, etc, and always wore the same t-shirts, etc na iilan lang talaga).

I feel bad for my mom kasi when she was younger, sobrang lavish ng lifestyle niya. Even when she started working, her dad would give her money to spend on buying clothes ns luxury goods. Since she stopped working early, all of her savings went towards buying my essentials and a few things for herself every now and then since my dad wouldn’t give her anything. Thankfully, mas okay na kami in recent years.

Me (22): Graduating from college soon, worked part-time while studying so I wouldn’t have to ask my parents for money. Achiever ever since kahit hindi naman ako prinessure ng parents ko. My parents happen to be the least successful sibling in their respective families so I’m trying to ensure that I become financially stable, given the huge age gap (parents are 60 and I’m only 22).

- My parents and I live in my mom’s family’s ancestral house that she inherited. She’s been living in it since she was born, too. My maternal grandparents lived with us in this house until both of them passed away.

Some of the many conflicts:

- My dad’s job is completely WFH cause he works for a foreign company. My PL said she’d stay in our house for a month, then suddenly told us na 3 months na bigla. She didn’t ask for my dad’s permission, she didn’t ask for my mom’s permission either, when this house is technically my mom’s.

- The neighborhood we live in isn’t as nice as it used to be. Our driveway always has our neighbors, dogs poop all over it, people park in front of our gate kahit hindi part ng main road yung portion na yun. Basically parang unsafe slum area, when it used to be so clean and orderly when I was a kid and before that time.

- My PL *ALWAYS* complains about pretty much everything when she’s with us, even though she gets to do things for free. Parang bata siya at kailangang nilalabas often, e sanay kami ng dad at mom ko na nags’spend ng quality time kasama ang isa’t isa sa bahay, basically we don’t get bored at home. But,  my PL literally holds a grudge and doesn’t talk to us when my dad doesn’t get to bring her to the casino. Pag natatalo siya, tinatarayan niya ako at nanay ko.

- My PL basically treats my mom like a maid and asks her to do different chores for her. Forgot to add that in the US, my PL lives with her husband (my paternal grandpa), and kid, and my grandpa does ALL of the chores kahit 85 na siya with a bad knee. Everything… From cleaning to cooking. My PL orders my mom around as if bahay niya mismo yung bahay namin. I’m really annoyed because my maternal grandparents were never like that.

- My PL expects my dad to be at her beck and call even when he works from home most of the time, but constantly travels to meet clients or hold demos. Again, nagtatampo siya pag hindi siya dinadala sa labas para gumala kasi feeling niya “kinukulong siya sa bahay.”

- To accommodate my PL’s 3-month-long stay in our house, she’s occupying the nicest (newly renovated) room in our house. The problem is, our one and only bathroom (with a shower) is there. So, imagine, how uncomfortable my mom and I are when we have to check if she’s using it, or inside it or not if we can shower. PL has been leaving food on the sidetables in the room she’s staying in, and I’ve seen rats go in and out of her room. My family is strict about not eating in rooms to prevent this. PL eats in bed sometimes.

- PL always pretends that she’s doing chores, but we’ve observed that she doesn’t even wash dishes properly. We tell her not to do it since we can, and she’s old, but she insists and we have to wash the dishes AGAIN after she does, just to actually clean them. (she doesn’t scrub them hard enough or use enough dishwashing liquid to fully remove residue).

- PL hates my tito’s wife (this tito is my dad’s brother). She’s from a new rich family, ostentatious, and pretty much fake on socmed. Battered wife but pretends her relationship with her husband is good. She’s rich so she often buys luxury goods and goes abroad, but my PL doesn’t like her, so she doesn’t really stay at their place unless wala kami ng parents ko. 

- PL says she doesn’t like staying in my tito’s place (condo) cause they don’t have proper wifi and don’t designate a room for her, so she sleeps on the couch. I know this isn’t good, but I hope she realizes that because she’s in one of our rooms, too, we basically lost an office space and both of my dad and I have to work in areas na hindi conducive to researching, working, etc. 

- PL has the AC in her room on 24/7 and paid my dad a pittance to compensate. My dad doesn’t care but I feel bad for him kasi even when my PL’s not here, nagtitipid dad ko on himself and di gumagamit ng AC unless it’s summer, o gabi na. 

- In the past few years, PL has been asking people to accompany her/sundo/hatid from the states or from the US kasi hindi na niya kayang magbiyahe mag-isa. On her way back to the PH, ang maghahatid sa kanya yung dad ko. He was supposed to stay in the states for a month, but he was a work trip during the latter weeks of that month in Dubai, so he rebooked his flight. He’ll be in the states for around 7-10 days na lang.

- PL got mad at him and said something like “what’s the point ng paghatid mo sa akin pag ang ikli lang ng punta mo?” and for once, my dad answered her back and said, “ayokong magtagal. may trabaho ako.”  Nagtampo PL after he said that, but they went to the casino today so I guess everything’s fine. I’m just glad my dad never gambled and will never gamble even though he has more money now. He hates going to the casino too, but he has no choice but to accompany her and appease her.

- Di kinikibo ng PL ko yung mom ko recently. We think it’s because nagtampo siya na hindi siya nalabas ng tatay ko, hay…

- PL is always used to getting her way and treats people badly if she doesn’t get what she wants and expects us to walk on eggshells around her.

- My mom and I don’t like being disrespected and feeling uncomfortable in our own house.

Anyway, from all of these problems…

TLDR: I don’t feel comfy with my lola after realizing that she’s manipulative and looks down on my mom and our house, despite basically freeloading here for MONTHS (without consent re the length of her stay). Her prolonged stay isn’t comfy for me, my mom, and my dad (bathroom issues and lack of a decent working space for my dad and I).

She also orders my mom around like she’s a maid. My mom isn’t poor, my family isn’t poor, but my PL looks down on us and is matapobre kahit na literal na dirt poor sila once.

I’m stressed because my maternal grandparents were never like that, and were always pleasant to my dad.

Naiipit na dad ko sa conflict and isn’t comfy either.

ABYG if I start talking to my PL less because of how much she stresses me out? I just want her to get out of my house and stay with my tito who’s rich, and a business owner, so that she can stop complaining about our household and neighborhood.

She’s so inconsiderate of everyone’s comfort, and expects us all to yield to her wants, despite this not being her own house or household.

Sa tingin ko, gago ako kasi ang hirap nga rin naman ng buhay ng lola ko rati, but I don’t think that justifies how poorly she treats my mom. We’re both well-educated but my PL talks to us as if we’re dumb and gullible. I don’t want to entertain her as a guest anymore.

My dad already defends my mom and I subtly but he’s only been firm with statements about PL not bothering his work matters. My dad also doesn’t give in to her wishes most of the time, but still, PL prefers staying in our house…

My other relatives (cousins) based in the US have cut ties with the family members we have in the US, and I realized that it was because of my PL.

Storing wealth and the different types,preppers,1hink3l,2024-12-20 11:29:30,16,0.77,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1hink3l/storing_wealth_and_the_different_types/,PrepperBoi,Discussion,"
I keep seeing questions in regards to keeping currency and stores of wealth (physical and virtual). I think we should put this on a megathread because it’s taking over the sub. 

Alas, here are some suggestions I would have in regards to how much to keep, where to keep, what to use it on, how to diversify, etc as well as the pros and cons of each type.

I think we can all agree diversity is a major part of prepping and that finances should be treated the same way.


1. Fiat currency (USD as an example): I keep some in my vehicle, about $500 in a locked glove box. I keep about the same in my home safe which I plan on increasing to 2 months of my monthly bills. I try to keep as little digital cash as possible (checking account/savings account) and instead move that to more long term stores of wealth that I can readily access. Physical cash, metals, bullets, food stores, crypto, etc.

Pro: local disasters, cash is king. You can’t have enough of it.

Cons: if the US banking system were to collapse it would lose value. Also, cash loses value every year due to inflation. 

2. Gold: This stays in the safe too. I have about $1000 worth in 1/10oz coins. 

Pros are that it’s very lightweight so better to bug out. Holds value well. It’s shiny and fun to collect. Has manufacturing uses.

Cons, if I sold now I would lose on premiums unless I sold to another person. You can’t eat gold. 

3. Silver: in the safe. I buy bars as well as coins and rounds. I tend to sell my bars and rounds and swap them out for silver eagles because they stack so well. I have maybe 3k in silver which I plan to convert to gold if the ratio gets better so it’s lighter. 

Pro: it’s very cheap relative to weight, can be sold fractional, has manufacturing uses.

Con: $2700 of silver is 5.6lbs. $2700 of gold is 1oz. Can’t eat silver

4. Cryptocurrency: I was keeping some of this as well but I recently sold locking in profits. I don’t keep money on this for very long. It’s the first store of wealth I liquidate. I spend this before I spend cash in my savings account.

Pros: massive growth, decentralized. If you are a day trader or spend a lot of time on it you can make some money, but that could be said about the more stable stock market as well. 

Cons: very volatile market. Depends on electricity to function. Can’t eat crypto. Hard to cash out in event of non-localized disaster.

5. Stocks: Non taxed brokerage accounts. You need to max out your tax advantaged accounts first before contributing but I generally invest in ETFs like VOO.

Pro: good stable growth

Cons: it’s the stock market, downturns happen. In non-localized disaster this could be worthless. Can’t eat stocks.

6. Bonds: good to be conservative if nearing retirement. Personally my accounts are 99% growth stocks because I’m relatively young. I decided to buy precious metals and store cash instead of 3-5% of my wealth in bonds. I transition I am still making. 

Pro: more stable that growth stocks

Con: can’t eat bonds, low growth. 

7. Foreign currency: I think of you live near another country border in Europe you should probably have some of that countries money. Maybe $2500 USD worth or so. I don’t think Americans need to do that. This is more for countries like Ukraine or Poland.

Pro: gives you diversity to bug out

Con: might have bad currency exchange ratio. Would be subject to inflation. Might become worthless.

8. Tax advantaged retirement accounts (stocks/bonds): this is the most important

Pro: you won’t starve in retirement

Con: might come at the cost of other preps.

9. Health savings account: if you can get one, max it out and don’t spend it until retirement.

Pro: tax advantaged.

Con: only can be used on health related items.

EDIT:

10. Commodities (Ammo, livestock, food, batteries, etc).

Pro: this is probably one of the best ways to prep. It will save you money in the long run as long as you don’t have things expire or ruin due to inflation. You can eat the food. You could trade this for things you need. You can use the ammo to defend yourself and your preps.  

Con: can take up a lot of room in your home. Likely the savings won’t make up for not having the equivalent money invested in stocks. Can be difficult to move (heavy, volume, etc). Can sometimes be hard to keep a secret. "

Basically for an extra USD $300 we'd be getting a newer CPU, GPU, and bigger storage but not the Asus pen. Display being IPS vs mini-LED doesn't really matter to her, and storage can be upgraded so that's also not a big issue either.

Any thoughts or insight on which would be better to buy? Is the performance similar enough that it is not worth it to pay an extra $300 for the newer version? She would also have to purchase the stylus pen separately which would up the price even more.

Or, is $300 actually good for the difference in the CPU and GPU? Also, some flaws users noticed in the 2022 version might have been addressed in the 2023 version?

This would be her main and only computer for everything -- daily tasks, studying, work, media consumption and processing (e.g. Photoshop etc.), programming, drawing, note-taking, graphic design. She wants a stable and durable laptop.

  
Thanks!

Seeking Feedback on My Proxmox Server + NAS Build with LLM Support,homelab,1hikb99,2024-12-20 08:57:14,1,0.6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hikb99/seeking_feedback_on_my_proxmox_server_nas_build/,fscheps,Help,"Hello all,

I’m planning a build primarily as a **Proxmox server** with **NAS functionalities** and the ability to **run local LLMs**. The focus is on reliability, expandability, and efficient power management. Here's the setup I'm considering:

# Build Components:

* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D
* **Motherboard:** ASUS ProArt X670E-Creator WiFi (with 10 Gbps Ethernet)
* **RAM:** 2 x Kingston KSM48E40BD8KM-32HM (32GB each, ECC, DDR5-4800)
* **Case:** Fractal Define 7 Black Solid
* **PSU:** be quiet! Straight Power 12 Platinum (1000W)
* **CPU Cooler:** Noctua NH-D15 Chromax

I am getting these components for around USD 1975 with (4 years warranty) (2 years standard here in Switzerland + 2 more years if I pay it with my local Credit Card that offers double the warranty).

# Planned Use Case:

* **Proxmox Server:** Running multiple VMs for various tasks, including LXC containers for lightweight services.
* **NAS:** Starting with 2x 20TB EXOS HDDs (which I already have), with the ability to expand to at least 6 drives in the future. I plan to install also at least 1 x 4 TB Samsung 990 Pro nVME for fast booting, etc. Maybe another too.
* **LLM Hosting:** Planning to run local LLMs (e.g., for AI workloads), with potential GPU expansion in the future for enhanced compute power.

# Goals:

* **Reliability:** ECC RAM for data integrity, critical for the NAS and LLM workloads.
* **Future-proofing:** Open to adding a **high-performance GPU** (e.g., RTX 4080 or 4090) later for AI workloads.
* **Efficient Power States:** Optimized for 24/7 NAS operation without excessive power draw.
* **Cooling:** Silent but effective cooling to handle the Ryzen 9 7950X3D under sustained loads.

Everything will be covered by an APC UPS to ensure its stable and shutsdown properly whenever needed.

I will also attach to it some local USB External Drives for local backups and then I will also do automated backups off-site.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you’ve built something similar or have experience with these components in a Proxmox setup. Any feedback, alternative suggestions, or warnings would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help!

Is there a repayment facility for under-collateralized loans on the Moria (MUSD) website?,btc,1hiiv4b,2024-12-20 07:35:39,8,0.78,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1hiiv4b/is_there_a_repayment_facility_for/,LovelyDayHere,❓ Question ,"I've seen a bunch of loans at just over 110% (the supposed threshold at which they become open repayment opportunities) but I've not seen any become open / openly repayable as such.

My question is whether that is a function that is not yet implemented on the website, and whether it might be (during the experimental phase) or if it will only remain open to wizards crafting the necessary transactions themselves during this test phase.

Website I'm talking about:

https://app.moria.money

&nbsp;

_For those who don't know, Moria USD (MUSD) is an experimental, smart contract based, overcollateralized stable coin created by Riften Labs, and being tested on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ecosystem. The current trial phase has a Sunset Clause which is scheduled to terminate around May 2025 at the latest, but can be invoked earlier should circumstances require it. Is is advised to treat it as an alpha test and not a final product, i.e. don't put large amounts of money you absolutely need, into it yet. My post is a technical question, not to be construed as financial advice in any way._"

* Lukáš Tvrdoň came to speak about sound design
    - Started out working on Miner Wars (2011-2012)
    - Worked on realistic sound mode to get feel like movie, 'Gravity'
    - With others made wooden gear to make sounds in ME
    - Sound design is a collaborative process with Marek and Engine team

---  

* Jan Hloušek came to speak about VRAGE3 engine design 
    - Started over 4 years ago to grow the team (from 5 to 35)
    - Dedicated teams for Engine, Render, Tools, etc
    - R&D team led by Petr Minařík (working on volumetric water)
    - VRAGE2 was not up to the task of scaling up the architecture for new features
    - Tested other 'off-the-shelf' game/physics/ai engines/libraries over half a year
    - Decided to build VRAGE3 from scratch for a strong foundation
    - Stable physics was a big requirement (latest Havok system chosen)
    - Important to keep simple data structures to facilitate modding
    - VRAGE3 will have an editor to simplify changing/creating blocks, etc
    - Mod structure will use 'partial override' and can even chain mods that build on each other
    - The editor is used for internal development too ('dog-fooding' their own tools)
    - First modding update will be about data modding, scripting comes later (with VS 2: Survival)
    - Public roadmap will help keep development focused, and delivered in a timely fashion
    - VRAGE3 uses a data-oriented approach
    - In future system will be parallelised for greater speed / efficiency
    - Built from scratch on DirectX 12
    - Considerable changes to voxel management code
    - Jan has been with Keen for 8 years
    - mod.io has deliberately been chosen for UGC from the beginning
    - Modding and Planets will be big steps
    - The plan is for 'no Clang' but who knows...
    - Biggest challenge has been to go from 'almost done' to polished enough for others to see
    - Multiplayer has been prepared within the architecture already (i.e. not bolted on afterward)

* Arron aka LSG (new Community Manager) joined over video to ask some community Qs  

    Q. Will SE2 be a direct sequel in terms of story?  
    A. It is a re-imagination of SE but adding new things like NPCs and water  

    Q. What new features will SE2 introduce?  
    A. NPC, Water, unified 25cm grid system, new visuals, new physics, new engine, better potential for optimizations, story and lore, living world, intuitiveness and flexibility  

    Q. Will SE2 support mods?  
    A. Mods are important, one part of the success of SE. VS 1.5 will see a VRAGE editor and VRAGE hub for players to mod blocks and assets. Scripts / modAPI well come later  

    Q. In which Vertical Slice can we expect Multiplayer?  
    A. 4th vertical slice, but things may change and come earlier  

    Q. What significant changes can we expect in Survival?  
    A. Backpack building (without refinery/assembler for early stage), projection building, better focus on game loop and goals, more flexibility  

    Q. It was mentioned that there is more of a focus on AI NPCs in SE2?  
    A. You may interact with human NPCs that live in a station, that have their own routine, or a ship encounter with people inside that you have to fight with, for example, using GOAP AI to plan and take actions like going to get resources to build. NPC vertical slice is at least a year from now.

    Q. Will SE2 be on consoles?  
    A. Yes, although during Early Access it will be focused on PC because it is easier for rapid development.  

    Q. How will SE2 improve performance of larger builds?  
    A. VRAGE3 will use a Data Oriented Architecture, parallelisation and other techniques, so each Vertical Slice will bring improvements in performance, much higher than SE1  

    Q. When can we expect SE2 'out of early access' release?  
    A. Don't want to commit to any date, but roughly speaking 3 - 5 years.  

    Q. Will there be any character customisation?  
    A. Things like changing gloves, etc, but not face customisation in the core experience.  

    Q. Any plans to put camera feeds on screens?  
    A. Not planned for the core experience.  

    Q. Any plans for painting one face of a block?  
    A. Considered, but complicated, so not planned.  

    Q. Airtightness in SE2?  
    A. Will definitely be a thing, needed for water as well.  

    Q. What fuel sources have you considered?  
    A. Similar to SE1. They are considering oil, but maybe not in core.  

    Q. Will there be in-game scripting?  
    A. Programmable blocks and scripting are planned. Performance and safety of scripts are a major consideration.  

    Q. Aerodynamics?  
    A. Not in core experience. Havok supports some aerodynamic physics, but not a near term plan.

    Q. Linux? Steam Deck?  
    A. Not a current target platform, but there have been experiments running on Steam Deck.  

    Q. Will DLC transfer from SE1?  
    A. Not planning for it, and not really possible due to platform licencing, and the content is all built new from scratch.  

    Q. Are pistons and rotors going to be in alpha?  
    A. Definitely core experience, but not decided which update they will be included in.  

    Q. Will the campaign be co-op and multiplayer?  
    A. No specific plan about this yet. Aiming for simplicity, so single player, but co-op could be considered.  

    Q. Orbital mechanics?  
    A. Not in the core experience, but eventually would like to add them.  

    Q. Any plans for new physics blocks, ball joints, springs?  
    A. Not at the moment.  

    Q. VR?  
    A. Not in the core experience.  

    Q. Voxel airtightness?  
    A. Not planned, but you never know.  

    Q. Any exciting new mechanical blocks?    
    A. Jan says biggest thing for him will be stable physics, but may build on from there.   

    Q. Will Survival be made harder i.e. difficult early but gets easy too quickly? 
    A. Planning things like backpack building, and better game loop from simple to harder challenges.  

    Q. Joystick support?  
    A. Not planned directly, but input system is versatile and supports a range of inputs.  

    Q. Shields?  
    A. Originally Marek did not want shields in SE, but would be more open to it now. Not planned though.  

* SE2 will have it's own support site for feedback, and bug reports.

Alzinova: A hidden Swedish Alzheimer’s gem at a USD ~30m valuation?,pennystocks,1hhb503,2024-12-18 15:38:42,11,0.84,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hhb503/alzinova_a_hidden_swedish_alzheimers_gem_at_a_usd/,Wendelah,:DDNerd: 🄳🄳 :DDNerd:,"\*\*\*Note: I have expanded on e.g. the competitve landscape, for those who are interested.\*\*\*

Hi all,

I would appreciate to hear your views on one of the cases that I’m the most bullish about coming into 2025. I'll lay out my thesis / pitch below, please do your best to shoot it down.

*Full disclosure, I have a sizeable position in this company, so do your own research and take everything I say here with a pinch of salt. I'm also based in Sweden.*

**Summary:** The company is Alzinova (ALZ.ST), a Swedish biotech company developing disease modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. Alzinova is currently wrapping up its phase 1b study in patients with its main candidate ALZ-101, with solid interim results. The data suggests that ALZ-101 may achieve something no other Alzheimer’s drug has – complete stabilization of cognitive decline in early-stage patients. These results build upon a strong scientific foundation showing that Alzinova's candidates have the potential to become best-in-class among Aβ-targeting therapies.

The company is currently listed on a small Swedish exchange (Nasdaq First North) with an EV of USD \~30m (\~30 cents per share), so we’re talking deep micro-cap territory from a US perspective. I assume that most readers on this forum (unfortunately) cannot trade this paper, but for those who can (e.g. via an international broker), my thesis is that Alzinova offers unparallelled R / R at these levels since (i) the underlying hypothesis is sound and (ii) the preliminary analysis suggests that the drug works, which is unheard of for an Alzheimer's project at this stage. If the effect size is as large as the trend shown in the 2nd interim reading (complete halting of cognitive decline compared to baseline noted among patients who received consistent treatment over at least 84 weeks, according to ADCOMS), it would be more than revolutionary as this has never been seen at this stage before. This “indicative trend” would of course need to be validated in a larger trial (the phase 1b was not powered to prove effect), but that kind of dose-dependent effect size in several patients should suggest some level of clinically relevant effect. Local Swedish biotech investors have seemingly completely missed this.

The company has engaged an American investment bank to evaluate strategic options (partnership / sale) for the continued development of ALZ-101 (a pivotal phase 2b / 3 is naturally in the cards). The investment bank in question has ""advised on previous closed transactions in the same segment"" - according to the company. We understand that basically the entire big pharma line-up with a neuro / Alzheimer’s focus awaits final analysis of part A1 and B, which will be completed in Q1’25. Given that the interim readings were so promising, and the space is so hot, you’re basically speculating on what type of deal that will be reached IMO. The company’s official stance is that a license agreement is the preferred route, but I believe that an outright sale is also on the table given the thin pipeline. Considering recent reference transactions (BioArctic, AC Immune, Aliada), the sky is really the limit if one were to draw any conclusions from the exploratory endpoints, which I argue is reasonable in this case. The full phase 1b study will be concluded in Q2’25, but the full part A1+B analysis in Q1'25 is the most important data point (as communicated).

**Update 2025-01-21: Several potential partners showed interest in the project during JPM.**

For those that are interested in the details, please find a wall of text below.

**1. Background**

* Alzinova AB is a Swedish biotech company focused on developing treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, leveraging its proprietary AβCC peptide technology to create precision therapies targeting toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers – widely considered to be the most harmful form of Aβ.
* The company’s lead candidate, ALZ-101, is a therapeutic vaccine designed to induce antibodies specifically targeting the toxic oligomers while avoiding non-toxic monomers and plaques.

**2. The underlying hypothesis**

* The toxic oligomer hypothesis suggests that Aβ oligomers drive synaptic dysfunction, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration, making them a key target for disease-modifying therapies. Since oligomers make up a miniscule amount of total Aβ, an oligomer-specific approach should, in theory, cause less disruption in the brain than broader Aβ-targeting therapies (e.g. the MABs Leqembi and Kisunla), potentially leading to fewer adverse events (e.g. lower rates of symptomatic ARIA-E/H).
* This hypothesis is supported by an extensive body of evidence spanning decades, with foundational studies such as Lambert et al. (1998), Walsh et al. (2002), and Haass & Selkoe (2007). These studies demonstrate that toxic oligomers are more closely linked to cognitive decline and neurotoxicity compared to plaques or monomers. Ongoing research continues to validate this idea.

**3. Given the consensus, why hasn’t the oligomer path been pursued earlier?**

* Technical challenges: Previous methods lacked the precision to isolate and stabilize toxic oligomers, hindering development efforts.
* Alzinova’s AβCC peptide technology uniquely solves this by creating a highly stable oligomer model, enabling the development of specific and effective therapeutics.
* Notably, Lars Lannfelt co-authored the seminal paper on Alzinova’s oligomer stabilization technology ([link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20713699)). For those who don’t know, Lars Lannfelt is the co-founder of BioArctic and inventor of the technology that was used to develop BAN2401, which later became the success story that we now know as Leqembi. I would argue that this is quite the endorsement of Alzinova’s therapeutic angle.
* In terms of competitors with a similar (theoretical) binding profile, we have ProMIS Neurosciences, a small Canadian company developing an oligomer-targeting antibody (PMN310). They have a different approach to solving the isolation issue, which might cause differences in clinical efficacy vs ALZ-101. My understanding is that PMN310's targeting is more narrow than ALZ-101's, potentially resulting in a less comprehensive oligomer binding profile. With that said, it's a promising approach and I'm excited to see what they can achieve. Safety and tolerability appears to be good, but trials in patients have not started yet, so comparable data will not be available in the near term.

**4. Disease-modifying therapies and their targets**

Oligomers and protofibrils - Leqembi / Eisai + Biogen (FDA / EMA approved example):

* Leqembi (Lecanemab) is one of the better-known anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies on the market, targeting Aβ oligomers and protofibrils - slowing cognitive decline by \~30% vs placebo. It requires IV infusions, but subcutaneous formulations are under development. ARIA-E of \~14% and ARIA-H of \~16% in patients, which is relatively modest.
* As the first drug to show clear cognitive benefits, it's viewed as a significant milestone in the amyloid therapy space. Cost of USD \~26,000 / year in the US, with continous use being necessary to maintain effects.

Pyroglutamate Aβ - Kisunla / Eli Lilly (FDA approved example):

* Another high-profile approach involves targeting pyroglutamate-modified Aβ (pE–Aβ), as seen with Eli Lilly's Kisunla (Donanemab), also a monoclonal antibody. Kisunla has been shown to slow cognitive decline by \~35% vs placebo. Since pE–Aβ is especially aggregation-prone and toxic, it's an attractive therapeutic target (more on this below). By targeting this form of Aβ it's possible to effectively clear Aβ plaque and remove a key driver of new Aβ aggregation.
* Kisunla requires IV infusions, but subcutaneous formulations are under development. Elevated ARIA-risk vs Leqembi due to aggressive plaque clearing, with ARIA-E at \~24% and ARIA-H at \~31%. Cost of around USD 32,000 / year in the US. Notably however, is that Kisunla can be used intermittently, i.e. once the plaque is cleared, one can take a break from the treatment,
* Recent transactions (AbbVie’s USD \~1.4bn purchase of Aliada and BMS’s licensing deal with BioArctic) underscore investor appetite for next-generation Alzheimer's therapies targeting pE–Aβ.

Aβ oligomers and fibrils - Aduhelm / Biogen (FDA approved example, but failed)

* Aduhelm (Aducanumab) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated forms of Aβ plaques, including both soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils, while sparing monomeric Aβ. Approved by the FDA through an accelerated pathway based on its ability to clear plaques. Elevated ARIA-risk vs Leqembi due to its broad binding profile, with \~40% of patients developing either ARIA-E/H or both vs \~10% in placebo.
* Aduhelm faced significant controversy due to mixed clinical trial results - showing modest cognitive benefits in one trial but not in another. Its high annual cost of around USD 56,000 and limited insurance coverage further hindered its commercial success.

Other Aβ-targeting:

* For instance, there are some companies exploring other combination approaches. One notable example is AC Immune with its ACI-24.060 vaccine, targeting oligomers and pE–Aβ.

Tau-targeting and other approaches:

* Multiple tau-directed antibodies or small molecules aim to slow tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation. While conceptually important, large-scale clinical successes are still pending.
* Other disease-modifying concepts include neuroinflammatory or synaptic-protection pathways, but none have fully matured to widespread approval or robust efficacy data.

In short, the market includes broad-spectrum anti-Aβ mAbs, oligomer- / protofibril-specific (Leqembi), and pyroglutamate-specific (Kisunla) therapies. Each has shown partial efficacy in slowing decline, but none have shown near-complete stabilization of cognitive decline in later trials (only in certain subsets of patients).

**5. A deep dive on pyroglutamate-Aβ, one of the hottest targets at the moment**

Why pE–Aβ has emerged as an especially promising target:

More likely to clump together:

* Sticky modification: pE–Aβ forms when a specific part of the Aβ protein changes shape by adding a small chemical ring. This makes the protein stickier and more likely to clump together.
* Aggressive clumping: These sticky pE–Aβ proteins form dangerous clumps faster and more aggressively than the regular Aβ proteins, leading to more toxic buildups in the brain. This means more general Aβ build-up, including harmful oligomers and pE–Aβ, which drives further Aβ aggregation, and so on.

Harder to break down:

* Protected from breakdown: The chemical ring in pE–Aβ protects it from being easily broken down by enzymes in the brain. Because pE–Aβ isn't broken down as quickly, it stays in the brain longer, giving it more time to form harmful clumps that damage brain cells.

Highly toxic:

* Powerful seeds: Even small amounts of pE–Aβ can kickstart the clumping of regular Aβ proteins, creating more toxic aggregates. These pE–Aβ seeds help spread the harmful Aβ clumps throughout the brain, amplifying disease progression.

Strong link to disease severity:

* Found in severe cases: Studies of brain tissues from Alzheimer’s patients consistently find pE–Aβ in the most severe amyloid plaques. Higher levels of pE–Aβ are linked to faster cognitive decline and more severe disease progression, making it a key target for treatment.

**6. How does Alzinova position itself in the competitive landscape?**

Alzinova hones in on the toxic oligomeric species - including oligomeric pE–Aβ. If ALZ-101’s conformation-specific vaccine can neutralize nearly all (or in theory all) toxic oligomers, it could disrupt pE–Aβ's function as a potent Aβ aggregation seed, inhibiting formation of larger aggregates (e.g. pE–Aβ protofibrils, which are also highly toxic). Other forms of pE–Aβ (monomers and fibrils) are much less toxic, and avoiding them is important to ensure low incidence of ARIA-E/H.

Some added colour:

* Comprehensive coverage of toxic Aβ oligomers: In theory, by targeting the mid-peptide β-sheet region that all noxious oligomers share, ALZ-101 could address pE–Aβ oligomers alongside “regular” Aβ oligomers. Essentially, Alzinova aims to cover the full range of Aβ oligomers, while sidestepping off-target binding to benign forms of Aβ.
* Why this matters: As mentioned, pE–Aβ is believed to be one of the most pathogenic forms of Aβ. If a single therapy like ALZ-101 can handle both standard and pyroglutamate-modified oligomers, it might surpass narrower pE–Aβ antibodies in overall efficacy while achieving a superior safety profile.
* First to neutralize “all” toxic species?: If ALZ-101 truly neutralizes the entire range of harmful oligomers, including oligomeric forms of pE–Aβ, it could, in an ideal scenario, make pE–Aβ–targeting therapies redundant. That’s a big if, but if the vaccine works as intended, this should be the case.
* Safety and simplicity: A vaccine approach also implies fewer infusions and potentially better acceptance if it delivers the same or superior disease-modifying outcome.
* Still speculative: It’s important to stress that until we see robust Phase 2 / 3 results, claims of covering “all toxic species” remain a hypothesis. But if proven, it could be a major differentiator.

**7. R&D programme**

* ALZ-101 (primary candidate, phase 1b near completion): A therapeutic vaccine inducing the patient’s immune system to neutralize toxic oligomers.
* ALZ-201 (secondary candidate, close to phase 1-ready): A monoclonal antibody with the same target as ALZ-101, offering potential for faster-onset treatment options. It could also act as an alternative to ALZ-101 for patients unable to mount sufficient immune response to the vaccine.

**8. ALZ 101 – Phase 1b (simplified) study design**

Endpoints:

* Primary: Safety and tolerability
* Secondary: Immunogenicity
* Exploratory: Biomarkers (i.a. CSF levels of p-tau181, total tau and neurogranin)
* Exploratory: Cognitive and functional measures (mainly ADCOMS)

Legs:

* Part A1
   * Placebo-controlled, randomized, double blind
   * 26 patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s
   * Three groups: 6 (placebo), 10 (125 mcg) 10 (250 mcg)
   * Treatment period of 16 weeks, dosing at 4-week intervals
* Part B, similar to A1 but:
   * 23 patients rolled over from Part A1
   * Single-arm extension where all patients received active treatment (250 mcg)
   * Treatment period of 20 weeks, dosing at 4-week intervals
   * Follow-up period of 48 weeks
* Part A2, similar to A1 but:
   * 6 patients, newly recruited
   * Single-arm, high-dose (400 mcg)

**9. Part A1 interim read-out (November 2023, January / May 2024)**

Early data provided validation of ALZ-101’s mechanism of action and safety profile.

Key findings:

* Safety and tolerability:
   * The safety profile was clean, with no ARIA-E/H reported.
* Immunogenicity:
   * ALZ-101 demonstrated robust and dose-dependent antibody responses, confirming the vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce specific antibodies against toxic Aβ oligomers.
   * Antibody titers were consistent across participants, with higher doses yielding stronger responses, supporting the vaccine's clear dose-response relationship.
* Biomarkers and cognition:
   * Early positive trends in biomarkers (e.g. p-tau181, total tau, and neurogranin) suggesting biological activity aligned with the mechanism of targeting toxic oligomers, reinforcing ALZ-101’s disease-modifying potential.
   * No trends in terms of cognitive and functional parameters were noted at this time.

**10. Part B interim read-out (December 2024)**

The latest results further validated ALZ-101’s safety profile and mechanism of action, while providing early signals of potential clinically relevant cognitive effects, further supporting its disease-modifying potential.

Key findings:

* Safety and tolerability:
   * The safety profile remains clean, with no new safety concerns emerging.
   * ARIA-E: Notably, the only case of ARIA-E occurred in the placebo group.
   * ARIA-H: Nine cases of asymptomatic ARIA-H (microhemorrhages) were reported, but:
      * All affected patients had a history of microbleeds, as confirmed by MRI.
      * ARIA-H cases were observed equally across all dosing levels, including placebo, suggesting no treatment-related signal.
      * The findings were described as “background levels” consistent with what is expected in early Alzheimer’s populations.
* Immunogenicity:
   * ALZ-101 continued to demonstrate robust and sustained antibody responses in patients treated across both Part A1 and Part B.
   * A dose-dependent response was observed, with higher doses generating consistently stronger immune activity, supporting the mechanism.
* Biomarkers and cognition:
   * Preliminary cognitive and functional assessments appeared to reveal stabilization of cognitive decline in patients who received continuous treatment during part A1 and B (at least 84 weeks). This should be compared to Leqembi and Kisunla where the effect size was significantly smaller, with a decrease in the cognitive decline of 30-40%, on top of resource intensive administration. However, one should note that both Leqembi and Kisunla saw stabilization in certain subgroups as well, so the extent to which stabilisation is the rule or the exception for ALZ-101 patients remains to be seen. In any case, depending on the quality of the data, it could be an indication of efficacy at a very early stage, which would de-risk the project significantly IMO.
   * Biomarker data will be delivered in Q1’25.

**11. Outlook**

Next steps:

* Preparations for a pivotal Phase 2b / 3 trial.
* Parallel dose escalation (400 mcg) study results expected in Q2’25.
* Potential fast-track designation or partnership with big pharma to accelerate development.
* Potential for an outright sale.

**12. Potential**

* Game-changer: ALZ-101, if successful, could revolutionize Alzheimer’s treatment, offering a safer, cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies such as Leqembi (USD \~26,000 / year).
* Market opportunity: Alzheimer’s represents a USD >10 billion annual market, and ALZ-101’s vaccine format is uniquely positioned for early-stage and preventative treatment.
* There have been a few recent transactions in the space highlighting big pharma's willingness to pay up for quality Alzheimer's assets. Notably:
   * **BioArctic (2024-12-19) licensing two pre-clinical Alzheimer's assets (BAN1503 and BAN2803, both pE–Aβ-targeting antibodies) to Bristol Myers Squibb for USD 100m upfront, total milestones of USD 1.25bn and tiered low double-digit royalties. BMS is betting hard on the quality of BioArctic's research engine here, since both of these projects are very early stage.**
   * AC Immune licensing their ACI-24.060 Alzheimer's vaccine to Takeda for USD 100m upfront, total milestones of USD 2.1bn and tiered double-digit royalties.
   * AbbVie acquiring Aliada Therapeutics for USD 1.4bn. Aliada's main candidate ALIA-1758 entered phase 1 (in healthy volunteers) in May 2024. The company has also developed a proprietary BBB-crossing technology that allows antibodies, such as ALIA-1758, to cross the BBB more efficiently.

**13. Why the stock is underappreciated**

* General Alzheimer’s skepticism: Investors are scarred by a long history of failures (Cassava anyone?).
* Microcap obscurity: Alzinova trades on the illiquid Swedish Nasdaq First North exchange with a USD 30m EV, effectively pricing in failure. The investor pool is almost exclusively local.
* Unrecognized results: The December results suggest truly groundbreaking potential, but awareness outside of Sweden is near zero. I also believe that local investors might consider the indicative December results to be a bit too good to be true coming from such a such small company that has never brought any drugs to market. Moreover, since we only have received interim results / analyses to date, there is limited ""hard data"" for investors to review at the moment, which might cause some hesitance - especially if one is not familiar with the underlying research / hypothesis. Moreover, important commentary was unfortunately provided in two interviews (on Dec 18th), and not in the official press release (on Dec 9th), which might have caused some unnecessary confusion among investors. Some kind of external validation is likely needed for a material revaluation, but my thesis is that this will happen sooner rather than later, when all cards are on the table.
* Fear of a dilutive equity raise: If the partnering efforts fail or are halted for whatever reason, Alzinova would have to turn to the equity markets for additional funding, which could be highly dilutive depending on the structure / reasoning / narrative. If the full analysis in Q1'25 is unequivocally supportive of the case, I believe (i) in an immediate revaluation and (ii) that a reasonably priced private placement to selected institutional investors would be the most likely scenario (vs a rights issue at a deep discount) if a capital raise were to be needed. With that said, a capital raise wouldn't be ideal from a value creation standpoint, irrespective of the format. For shorter term capital needs, some kind of bridge facility would make the most sense. In any case, one should keep this in mind before investing. I expect the cash position to last into Q3'25 (at least), and that a potential big pharma deal would materialise inside of that.

**14. Parallels to BioArctic**

* Similar to Leqembi, Alzinova’s ALZ-101 leverages insights from Lars Lannfelt’s foundational research, but with more precise targeting and potentially superior safety / efficacy.
* Leqembi targets oligomers and protofibrils, another toxic (but more stable) form of AB. The more directly toxic oligomers act as intermediates in the aggregation pathway, and successful targeting of these could disrupt formation of protofibrils to a certain extent as well. So in addition to effectively clearing out the toxic oligomers, ALZ-101 could also have the benefit of inhibiting the downstream formation of protofibrils.
* The success with Leqembi has driven BioArctic's valuation to USD \~1.5bn (slowing cognitive decline by \~30%). Alzinova’s ALZ-101 arguably targets a more critical (and upstream) mechanism – with a cleaner safety profile and earlier positioning in the development cycle, increasing the upside potential. However, BioArctic has a broader development programme, which one should keep in mind, but most of the value is attributable to Leqembi.

**Conclusion**

At these levels, Alzinova represents a rare opportunity with uniquely skewed R / R. With scientifically robust technology, exceptional early results, alignment with the evolving consensus around amyloid pathology, and best-in-class potential, ALZ-101 could be a real breakthrough therapy. The December data significantly de-risked the project, and upcoming milestones (phase 2b / 3 preparation milestones, partnerships, M&A) could act as major catalysts.

TL;DR: Alzinova (USD 30m EV) has shown early signs of halting cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients – a feat no drug has ever achieved. With a (seemingly) cleaner safety profile and a convenient vaccine format, I would argue that the market is completely off the mark on this one."
Planned out expenses for a great life,FatFIREIndia,1hh8qi8,2024-12-18 13:55:02,31,0.87,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/FatFIREIndia/comments/1hh8qi8/planned_out_expenses_for_a_great_life/,RealPineapple4741,,"I currently work in the US (M26) and have saved up over 50 lakhs INR (been working for almost 2 years and I have been planning to move back to India sometime in the future (around 5-10 years max). We currently live in a Tier 3 city and I am planning out my expenses to support my parents as well as my family, if and when, I do have a family. 

My father currently sits on a 99% Real Estate portfolio valued around 50 Cr. He was not into Equity markets and has started recently, although, I am the one leading those investments. 

So, I will be inheriting his portfolio at whatever it will be valued in 5 - 10 years and I believe we shall need monthly expenses of around 10 - 12 lakhs a month in a tier 1 city to meet our lifestyle goals. 

So, with that in mind, and the fact that most of my savings will be in USD and not liquidated even after I move back to India, how much of a corpus should I be looking at while planning for fatFIRE? How much should I rebalance his portfolio and include other sources like Gold, Equity, etc to ensure a stable partial income? I plan on working while in India (just because I haven’t figured out my passion project as a professional endeavour yet) and hope to have decent income as well so, is 10 - 15 lakhs a month (primary from my income + residual/other sources) a reasonable expectation without eating into the principal corpus? I do not plan on owning a house and would prefer a nice house on rent (we own a decent house in our hometown) so, considering tier 1 cities, how much would be a realistic expectation for a proper lifestyle? Any other expenses I’m currently ignoring/not planning? 

Thank you in advance! 

Edit: He currently has very low expenses due to tier 3 city costs but earns around 2 lakhs from rental income and other interests and gets by on that income (nice car, house helps, driver, gardener, nice house). I am assuming our costs will rise significantly once we move to a tier 1 city in some years. 

Edit 2: I do not see the point of buying a house and am leaning towards renting. I do want my parents close by due to some health concerns in the past and I do foresee myself getting married and having kids (for now) and my planning DOES include the costs of future education as well. My investment (3 MFs are primarily for my to-be children’s education currently valued around 10 lakhs each). 

I do plan on travelling internationally at least once or twice a year and also want a good car in India (SUV like an X5 or something similar). 

I do foresee myself working for some time post my move (just as a parachute) but also aim to start a business or at least create multiple sources of income including rent, dividends and SWPs. 

My idea includes 10 lakhs of passive income (plus 5 lakhs if I work) to take care of everything in a city like Mumbai/Delhi and living in a nice house (>5000, 6000 sq ft). "

T14 Taiwan Official Website Customized Laptop Delivered – Unboxing

1. Key travel is 1.5mm, which is worse than I expected. However, this might be because I’m used to desktop keyboards. I’m not a heavy typist, but just typing a few words already feels like my fingers are constantly hitting the keyboard chassis.  
It seems Lenovo thinks reducing the chassis thickness by 0.3mm is more important than user experience.  

2. The build feels solid, but I’ll have to wait for an accidental drop test to verify.  
Is the military-grade standard just marketing hype, or is it genuinely part of the design?  

3. The screen is from China Star Optoelectronics (CSOT), model MNE007JA1-2. It’s not from AUO, Samsung, Chunghwa Picture Tubes, or Innolux, but it does cover 100% of the color gamut. Can anyone share what level of panels CSOT typically produces?  

4. The speakers are decent. There’s no fancy Harman branding, but I’m not demanding. Watching outdoor news videos, I can clearly hear layered background car noises, which is good enough for me.  

5. The pre-installed 16GB RAM module is from Samsung, a well-known brand. I suppose Lenovo wants to avoid customer complaints about RAM failure during critical moments. That said, we paid extra for this configuration, so I wonder what brand the standard 8GB module would be.  

6. The biggest selling point of this T14 Gen 5** is returning to a DIY-upgradable design. Even the screws are designed to stay attached to the chassis after loosening, making reassembly convenient. From videos, the battery, SSD, and RAM appear easy to replace. RAM slots are no longer soldered, with just one slot for expansion – a “genius design” of the past. Instead, you can now install two 48GB RAM sticks for a total of 96GB in dual-channel mode.  

I don’t get it – excellent upgrade features were removed from business laptops, only to be reinstated in Gen 5 as if it’s some groundbreaking innovation. WTF?  

Feels like in Gen 7, they might restore the key travel to 1.8mm or 2mm and then heavily promote it as the “best keyboard design on the market for typing.”  

7. The hinge is still not plastic. The screen can lie flat at 180 degrees, which is great for discussions with colleagues. At least it doesn’t feel like it’s about to crack after a few opens and closes. But!  

The hinge has become noticeably thinner. Unless this is a new design with unchanged stress tolerance and material strength despite its reduced size, I would call this progress. Otherwise, it just seems like another cost-cutting measure.  

Conclusion:
This serves as a record to see whether low-temperature soldering will cause problems over time.  

I don’t demand high performance – as long as it’s cheap, durable, and stable, I’m satisfied. Ordering from the Taiwan official website is hassle-free. Lenovo delivered it on the 8th day after placing the order, which is quite efficient.

Here's the context:

I’m a 37-year-old mechanical/software engineer married to a 31-year-old, and we’re expecting our first child. We currently live in the U.S. but are considering moving back to Canada to be closer to family.

We have about **$1.6M CAD in savings** split out as follows: 80% VOO, 10% cash and bonds, 10% in bitcoin. I rebalance every couple months on this split currently.

We also have about **$350k CAD equity in our current U.S. home**, which we purchased in 2019 (30-year mortgage locked in at **3%**).

Here’s our cashflow situation:

* My wife works and earns **$5k USD/month** as a 1099 contractor, but she plans to become a stay-at-home mom soon.
* I get some cashflow from an old startup I built (**about $7k USD/month**) but that will probably only last another year or two
* For the past year I've been bootstrapping a **hardware startup** with a long term 3-5 year outlook before it might make any real money

I’m trying to decide how to structure our finances moving forward and whether to sell our current home and buy a place in the city we’re moving to, or keep it as a rental. I’m also debating whether to keep my investments in VOO or move to a more conservative approach.

Here are the two main options we’re considering (I am also open to other suggestions):

# Option 1: Sell the Home, Buy in Canada, FIRE Approach

* We’d sell our current U.S. home and buy a nice house in Canada for around **$600k CAD** (it’s a low-cost-of-living city, so $600k goes a long way). This type of house is something we could be comfortable in and grow into with two kids fairly easily
* This would leave us with around **$1.4M CAD** in savings, which we’d move into more conservative investments to generate stable passive income.
* Our monthly expenses in Canada would drop to around **$5k CAD**, which we could mostly cover with investment income and cashflow from my business until it dies. (This is a lot lower than our current cost of living due to no healthcare costs in Canada and even $5k CAD with no mortgage is probably on the high side)
* Pros: Financial stability, no worries about cash flow, low stress while I try my new startup, close to family and friends **(wife grew up in this city)**, and a paid-off house.
* Cons: Long, cold winters in this city (6+ months), no opportunities (not very exciting and not much going on) and I’m not sure if I want to live there long-term.

# Option 2: Keep the U.S. Home, Rent in Canada, Stay Flexible

* We’d keep our current U.S. home (with the 3% mortgage) and rent it out, likely breaking even or slightly negative after maintenance costs. Long term though, it would most likely pay off with the low locked in rate
* We’d rent in the Canadian city for now to see how we like it before committing to buying.
* We’d keep our investments in VOO for growth potential and supplement living expenses if needed by me doing a part-time gig if needed, although, my old startup might be able to cover 100% of our monthly expenses here for at least next year.
* Pros: Flexibility to leave the LCOL city if we don’t like it, potential for our U.S. home to appreciate over time, and staying invested in growth assets for long-term upside.
* Cons: Uncertainty with cash flow, managing a rental property from afar, and potentially delaying financial independence if the market drops.

**Big Question:** Should I shift my investments to something more conservative and lock in stability (bird in the hand), or keep my portfolio growth-oriented to leave open the option of moving to a more expensive area in the future?

I’m torn because we’re technically close to FIRE if we live frugally, but I’m also hesitant to commit to living in the LCOL city long-term. A part of me says to keep our investments as is, rent in the new city, and supplement cash flow if needed, but I’m wondering if I’m underestimating the benefits of locking in stability.

**What I’d Love Your Input On:**

1. Have you faced a similar decision? How did you balance stability vs. flexibility?
2. If you were in my shoes, would you prioritize locking in financial independence now or staying flexible for future options?
3. What am I missing that I should be considering?

36/M/Single- I only started earning more money in the last 3-4 years. I spent a lot in my 20s and didn’t earn as much. 

I didn’t grow up rich, so having such $ is new to me. I am from Singapore, so we should purely just look at my few “investment” strategy/plan below and ignore things like insurance, apartment (where I’d stay), day to day stuff etc as it gets complex trying to explain it. 

Currently, I have:

180k~ in IBKR
40K in endowment maturing in about 3 years
80k in emergency cash earning 3% a year. 

Shared investment property with my friend and we will take profit in about 1.5-2 years time. We can assume my take profit then is around 70k. Pls discount my capital because it needs to go somewhere else. 

Bulk of my IBKR portfolio comes from TSLA and PLTR. 

Mkt Value 
Majority pool $160k
TSLA PLTR MSFT 

Minority Pool
SOFI, NU, NVDA, AMD - Around 20k

I started dca-ing in VUAA recently at $500usd a month.

Right now, I am thinking of:

1) Selling 20% of tsla (20k), and selling my pool of minority group of shares 20k and with this 40k put it into a single company. A bit more risky? So hopefully higher reward.

2) Sell ALL put 100k into microsoft, google or one of those stable firms that is likely to grow in the long run and buy more when it dips (or dca) with the remaining 80k. 

3) Sell ALL, use 100k to trade, remaining 80k into the emergency funds pool. I am not an experienced trader but I started this journey with 85k and have already more than doubled many thanks to tsla and PLTR.

I do not intend to put fresh funds into IBKR (aside from the $500 usd monthly vuaa) now because I feel that while 80k emergency savings is ok, I would like to have more. Maybe 120k (?) to feel more secure. I also struggle with how much is enough as I am also responsible for my parents. I am fine caring for them, so we don’t need to go into details about their finances or any other help.

My goal is that I would like my money to grow faster, and more for rainy days, live a little and hopefully retire sooner than later. 

Any two cents worth in today’s market?

Mkey Pro Review,MontechPC,1hedb0s,2024-12-14 16:43:21,6,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontechPC/comments/1hedb0s/mkey_pro_review/,Feonzer,,"Hey guys and girls, just wanted to post a little information on the MKey Pro I received for review purposes. Full disclosure, I am in my 40s, have been gaming since I was around 12, and have had my fair share of peripherals throughout my tenure as a pc nerd. I received this keyboard at no cost, nor with any instructions on review guidelines. These are all my own words and thoughts of the people I work with who also got to sample this rather interesting keyboard. For reference, I received the darkness, with yellow switches, and my previous keyboard was a Corsair K100, which I have had for the past 4 years.

 

The MKey Pro represents a bold entry into the premium budget gaming keyboard landscape. Launching with a MSRP of 89.90, it does not stand alone in this price range, however several key factors do give it an edge after our two-week testing gauntlet. While color options are limited; (Darkness and Freedom), as are the switch options; (Gateron Yellow and Brown), the rest of the features and functions tend to make up for this. The keyboard offers tri mode functionality, (wireless, Bluetooth, and wired), convenient dongle storage, and a build quality that makes you question if they priced it a little too cheap.

 

Build Quality / Package / Typing Experience

 

The packaging is akin to any smart phone you may have purchased recently, sturdy, smooth to open, and well protected in foam. It was satisfying to open the box, and find everything you would need in the package, (Keycap pullers, Switch pullers, USB cable, Handy reference card for mac/windows layout shortcuts), and all in all, was a respectable experience, with no extra bloat in the box.

 

The build quality is where the bulk of this keyboard comes into play, and when I say bulk I’m talking weight, not size. Let me be the first to say this keyboard feels SOLID, heavy, stays in place exceptionally well, and generally feels like a premium product rather than a budget option. At just shy of a Kilogram, the weight really adds substance to this device, and you will definitely feel like it is GLUED to your mouse mat / desktop.

 

Moving on to the typing experience, the first thing I checked, as I’m sure will be the first thing you check, is the spacebar well stabbed. Breathe a sigh of relief, moving on the lateral plane my review keyboards spacebar didn’t wobble or teeter in the slightest. Much to my enjoyment, every single keycap felt solid, in place, and incredibly stable. The volume/multi-function knob has a satisfying segmented clicking rotation, and a solid push to change functions with decent feedback. Weight, check, stability, check, now on to the other most asked question, it’s a keyboard, how does it feel to type?

 

Once again breathe a sigh of relief because these Gateron yellows feel incredibly smooth, have a nice actuation sound, smooth push through, and are an overall joy for me to type/use in gaming. Having a multi angle two-stage foldable keyboard support is also a nice touch. The multi-function knob has three modes, that are cycled by clicking it inwards, which are volume control, rgb preset control, and zoom control. Now for me personally, the zoom functionality isn’t important, but I can’t really dock them marks for including extra things that I don’t find useful.

 

The wireless and Bluetooth worked well, battery life was decent overall, not the best I have ever seen, but not the worst. (RGB bleeds it faster, be warned) but I feel like most gaming folks will end up using it in wired mode regardless, so again, this doesn’t really affect my scoring in any way.

 

RGB/Customization

 

Now this is where my team found a few issues that we must talk about, first being the keyboard comes in multi color options, with nothing in the more “plane” color gamut. This is not a deal breaker for me personally, but some of my members would have liked to see maybe one- or two more-color schemes that were a little calmer, with all white or black keycaps. While on the subject, some people may not enjoy the fact that the RGB is not full customizable rgb, but argb instead. This in of itself is not a dealbreaker, and while my team knocked a few points off for it, I let this slide as for the price point, I’m more than happy with what I received. In fact, the only place I was not over the moon ecstatic with the keyboard is I would have liked to see some sort of translucency through the keycaps, to illuminate the keys in the dark. As it stands, the border of the keys light up wonderfully, but you can’t really see the face of the key when its dark.

 

So where do we stand on this keyboard? Overall, we are very happy with this keyboard, especially at its price point. Given that nowadays people are much happier to save on things that are not as essential; to put that money elsewhere into their rigs, this keyboard fits a perfect bill. I gladly rate this a 9.5/10, while the rolling average of my team (7 members excluding myself) is at a median 8.5/10. So, if you are in the market for a keyboard at the 75% formfactor and were curious if Montech can breach this market space, worry not. The MKey Pro is a fantastic option, at a terrific price point, with rock solid build quality. You will not regret buying this one, and it has quit a lot of amazing things going for it at 89.90 USD at the time of writing.

 

TLDR :

Pros : Amazing build quality, superb typing experience, sub 100 USD price point

Mid : Lack of color schemes, no full RGB control,

Cons : Nothing of severe note was found to detract from the scoring

 

 

\*Thanks for the opportunity to review this keyboard, it's been on my radar since it was announced, and also it was much appreciated you gave me no instructions, makes my life easier when I don’t feel pressure on talking about a product I received for free. Keep up the good work, I’m happy the world is moving away from 300-dollar peripherals, gives me a chance to upgrade my cpu 😊

"~2650 grafts, Dr.Pukpinya/Dr.Patty (Hairtrans clinic, Bangkok) Review/Report

I’ve been lurking on this sub for quite a while and finally took the plunge to get my hair transplant. I went with one of the more recommended doctors within my budget, Dr Pukpinya at the Hairtran clinic in Bangkok. I’m currently day 3 post OP and thought I'd share my journey like so many before me! I'll break down my experience into parts so that it's easy to follow.

**Medical History**

I’ve been on oral Finasteride (1mg) for about 2 years prior to my transplanting. My hairline is stable/not further receding. I have not taken minoxidil in any form prior to transplant. I occasionally have taken biotin/random hair supplements on and off.

**Setting up the Appointment**

This was all done through Whatsapp. Initially self taken pictures are uploaded and sent via the Whatsapp number. Then the next stage is a video call with the doctor, who looks and kind of guesstimates how many graphs you will need from the pic. In my case it was predicted I would need between 2 and 2.5k grafts. Then you pay a deposit of 20% of the guestimated graphs. I paid a bit over 700 bucks and each graft was about 1.4 usd per graft. I set up the appointment in March, for December and I’m unsure that her current prices are the same as what I got. I booked a hotel (Jasmine 59) that was really nice for about 45 bucks a day for 10 days.

**Preoperation**

**T**hey send a PDF with a bunch of preop instructions that basically amount to no drugs/alcohol/smoking etc for a few weeks before the surgery. No caffeine the day of and after the surgery. Eat breakfast before going in. (You're not put under general anesthetic where you arent supposed to eat prior to the surgery.) 

Then you need tests for covid and HIV. The covid test you can get from any random pharmacy for about 400 baht which comes to a bit under 15 usd I did this the day prior to the surgery and sent them a pic via Whatsapp. 

The HIV test they do in person for you on the day of surgery, probably because its transmissible by blood and so working in any kind of surgery where there will be bleeding is risky if you have detectable HIV.

On the day of the surgery I was taken in by the technician and preop photos were taken. You were then sent to meet the doc, who drew the hairline on your forehead with some kind of blueish ink and adjusted that until you are both happy with what you want. It was drawn freehand with a cotton swab dipped in ink and adjusted till the doctor was satisfied, as well as made slightly irregular. 

During this time, the doctor also spent time going over potential post op complications, pictures of extreme results that could happen in the negative sense etc. She did this in the initial Whatsapp discussion as well to an extent. 

After the hairline was drawn the next thing that was planned was the density of the hairline and the kinds of graphs that would be put. The doctor mentioned that the front hairs and the hair at the side (framing the face) is thinner than the donor hair (which comes from the back). This transplanted hair will be thicker and not as fine as the original. At the sides as well, the angle of the hair will not perfectly match the natural hair that was there prior. This is usually not noticeable when looking at it from the front, but it can be slightly noticeable if you know what to look for when looking at the side. I myself wouldn't notice till she showed me with a highlighter using some example photos.

For the density of the hairline, it was planned that we would have the initial 5 rows to be single hair follicles while the ones behind that would have more. 

The doctor then, in a way reminiscent of my 10th grade, traced my drawn hairline over some plastic, and then put that over graph paper. She measured this and drew out the density of the hair transplant and did a more accurate estimation of how many hairs I would need, which came to something in the 2630 (I think, something around that number). 

Here I then paid for the remainder of my treatment. They also charged me about 150 usd for PRP in which they do a blood draw, extract platelets rich plasma, and inject that in the scalp- this is supposed to help with healing and gives better results. I admittedly, didn't do much research on it, but ended up getting it at the doctors recommendation.

They then took me to shave my head. The donor region (the back) and the recipient (the front needed to be shaved but the rest was optional. Since I had about three weeks post surgery before I had to get back to class I decided to keep the top, so that I could combover/cover the transplanted area, as you can see from the pictures. With that length I can usually style it in a forward fringe covering the transplant region. Three weeks is also enough time for enough hair to cover the donor region such that those scars aren't really visible either.

At this point I was given antibiotic, painkiller and some medicine to make me sleepy (probably to make the long surgery go faster.) The doctor mentioned the total time of surgery would be 4-5 hours. It was 1130am and I had it there at a little before 10. So all this took about an hour and a half. 

Then they provided me with a sugary drink- it was beyond disgusting. It wasn't medicine, it was literally a glass of what is suspect is some fruit flavoured liquid sugar syrup. I diluted it multiple times before somehow finishing it. From what I gather, you lose blood with all the cuts they make during the surgery so pumping you full of sugar helps you not faint during this process. And I like sweets but when something is sweet to this level it's almost sickening.

They then informed me that I would have a break in the middle of my surgery for lunch. I was vegetarian and they gave me a menu from a fully vegan restaurant in which I asked them to get me a pad thai for lunch.

**The Operation**

The operation was essentially divided into 3 different parts. The first part was creating the cuts on the recipient area. The second part was extracting the donor hair and the final part was the implantation.

For all of these parts they need to numb you and they do so with Lidocaine which is the same local anesthetic you get when you go to the dentist. The difference is it hurts quite a bit worse and for the 5-10 minutes of needle stabbing it feels endless. They try to make it feel better by having someone give you a foot massage while they are injecting and numbing the area with ice before they stab but its absolutely miserable. If a dental injection is like a 2-3/10 in pain this is like a 5/10 (so easily twice as painful if not more.) But the difference is its cumulative. Any one shot is bearable on its own, but its like shot after shot. At one point I remember asking how many more and the technician said 10 and I wish I hadn’t asked. 

These are the 5-10 minutes you have to grit your teeth and go through and are easily the worst part of the whole thing. After this however its completely painless. I

The anesthetic was injected by technicians, however the actual incisions made after that are done by the doctor entirely. For the next hour or so she slowly made the cuts on the recipient area. This also gave her an accurate idea of just how much she needed to take from the donor region. The sleep medicine they gave me took some effect here. I don't think I fell asleep but I kind of dozed of into a semi-sleep daze and time passed quickly.

Then came part 2 of the surgery which is the extraction of hair from the donor region. There are 2 ways to do this, FUE and FUT. These are two ways to harvest the donor region. In FUT they basically cut out a strip of the scalp, take the hairs out of them, in FUE they pluck the individual hair follicles out. Both of them give similar results but if you harvest donor region with FUT youl get a linear scar where the skin has been stripped, and with FUE you get a bunch of light circular scars where the hairs have been extracted. Neither are visible unless you get a skin fade on your donor region. However FUE tends to be less visible in most cases. Dr. Pukpinya used the FUE method. 

Once again we had the anesthetic, this time stabbed into the back of my head. This was far, far less painful like a 2-3/10 and was easily bearable. Once again i kind of dozed off as the hair follicles were extracted. This took another hour.

Once the hairs were extracted they had to be prepared, counted and sorted. Survival of the hair follicles decreases the longer they are out of you so you want to quickly get to the implantation part. At this point both the incisions in the recipient area were made and the grafts from the donor area were extracted. I was given a bathroom/lunch break for 10 minutes while they finished sorting the extracted hair. I ate my pad thai and along with it was ANOTHER glass of that sugar syrup. The pad thai was delicious and the drink was depressing, honestly at least half as bad as the anesthetic. 

Anyway after ruining my diet by chugging down probably 1000 calories of concentrated sugar, I made my way back to the third and final part of the surgery. Here, the doctor takes the grafts and places them in the previously made incisions. This can be done in two ways, either with forceps or with an implanter pen. When using an implanter pen the technique is called DHI, which is what was used here. This took around an hour and half in which I dozed off completely.

At this point I was finally done. They took photos of my hair post operation and then gave me my post op instructions and sent me home.

**Post OP**

After the operation, you were given a ton of instructions. Basically it came down to this;

1. Don’t touch your hair for any reason.
2. Spray with saline solution every 3 hours
3. Don't expose the hair to direct sunlight. For the next 3 months (they gave a weird hat that covers the head without touching the hair and ties over the forehead),  you can wear a regular hat after 2 weeks.
4. Dont exercise for the next 14 days
5. Don't wash/shower over it directly
6. No caffeine/smoking or anything that could affect wound healing
7. Sleep on your back for the next 14 days

I was given sleeping pills in case I found it hard to sleep, pain killers to help with pain, minoxidil and finasteride (oral for both) and a set of antibiotics with the instructions to finish a series of antibiotics, and take oral min and fin.

I am a side sleeper and I was terrified that I would roll over in my sleep and just ruin my transplant or something. What helped me and what the doc instructed was to wear a neck pillow and sleep on a pillow (so our head is elevated. This literally stops you from being able to turn as the neck pillow will catch as you turn. It was a bit hard initially to get to sleep, but my jetlag really came in clutch for me and I was able to pass out for a glorious 7 hours.

I didn't take any painkillers and had 0 pain of any kind post op.

Even though I don't normally take minoxidil, the doctor wanted me to take it for a yearish after my transplant and that it would help my results.

I would then come the next day for a followup and washing session where they would teach me how to wash my hair. They basically used baby shampoo which they patted on the recipient area (no rubbing, just patting in straight down motions, and lightly) after which they washed it with a shower head on super low pressure. Then they had me sit under a lazer cap thing for low level light therapy for 20 minutes. 

While I had no pain, I had tremendous itching which constantly tempts you to pick at the recipient area. I accidently touched it once and was terrified I ruined it, but generally speaking if you lightly touch it by mistake ( no rubbing just straight down) you will not dislodge the graft. They gave me some antihistamines to control the itching which didn't help much to be honest, so this was a bit of a grit your teeth and bear it.

After day 3 you pass the most vulnerable part, but dafter the day 10-14 mark is when the grafts are really lodged in. After 2 weeks, even if you scrub them, while the hair might fall off, the follicle/root is implanted and wont be dislodged so your pretty safe at that point.

I'll be leaving on day 10, so all my followup consultations will be virtual. Since I have to take pics anyway for my day 14, 3 month, 6 month etc, I'll also post updates on my progress then.

Hopefully my story gives you an idea of what to expect from the surgery! It was lovely, the doctor was wonderful and I felt that she knew what she was talking about as she walked me through everything. Of course as they say, what matters is the end result- and we will see that in the months to come. 

**Costs**

The overall surgery + PRP ran me at about 3800 usd. The actual grafts used were about 60 more than the guestimation they did with the graph paper drawing. I was not charged for those extra grafts which was nice.

I got a 1300 usd flight via turkish airlines. And hotel and food ran me another 1000 usd over 10 days.

So total cost was a bit over 6k.

Help with $20 usd for food,Assistance,1hd9le5,2024-12-13 05:43:42,2,0.54,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1hd9le5/help_with_20_usd_for_food/,messychica,REQUEST FULFILLED,"Hi guys! Like many of others here, last months have been really tough for me both financially and emotionally, specially since I still haven’t been granted my residence permit (I’m currently on a student’s permit) which would give me the chance to have a stable job. It could take up to six months until I’m given a resolution.

So I do freelance work or clean a house every now and then, but 90% of the little money I do is for rent alone, so I’m left with almost nothing for food. Fortunately I have some things like rice, pasta and lentils.

My dad used to give me a hand sometimes but he died two months ago. He left some little money, but my (greedy) siblings who are in my native country, have taken that money for themselves and left me with nothing (when they know I’m struggling but they only care about themselves)

So I’m asking for $20 usd so I can buy mill, yogurt, frozen chicken meat, bread, apples, deodorant and shampoo to help me get through the next days.

I wish I could do an amazon wishlist, but I’m based in Spain and I know people here are usually from USA. I have a paypal account if someone wants to help me out <3 with whatever you’re able to :)

Thanks a lot and good wishes for everyone :)"

Hvis ikke, holy fuck. 400 mUSD deal er på siste stadiet, det er ingen konkurrenter igjen og de jobber nå med betingelsene. Dette gir 84 mUSD i inntekt i året og åpner for en deal på 2,5 bUSD de neste 10. De guider 2025 på 90 mUSD og det er fra backlog(Altså dealer som er allerede landet i 2024). CFO snakket om positiv risiko for guiding som betyr at alle nye dealer i 2025 ikke er tatt med og 400+dealen ikke er priset inn.

Should I leave my stable job for a higher-paying role at a smaller company?,jobs,1hcl0io,2024-12-12 08:24:21,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hcl0io/should_i_leave_my_stable_job_for_a_higherpaying/,Comfortable_Fox_6201,Leaving a job,"Hello reddit,

I’m looking for some advice about a major career decision I’m facing. Here’s the situation:

**Background:**

* I’m Colombian and currently working for a large company (5K-10K employees) where I’ve been for 2 years. My role involves working with a US client, and while the work itself is somewhat boring, it’s stable.
* A week ago, I got an offer from a smaller company (11-50 employees, founded in 2017) for a senior role with higher pay but less apparent stability.

Here are the **pros and cons** of my current job:

**Current Job - Pros:**

1. Big company with good benefits: I work from home, get health insurance, PTO, and vacation days.
2. Relatively good pay: I earn $4,000 USD monthly, which after taxes gives me $3,200 USD – more than enough to live comfortably in my country.
3. Job security (sort of): If my current client doesn’t renew my contract, I’d be moved to a talent pool until another client needs my skills.
4. Familiarity: I’ve built relationships here and don’t have to go through the emotional effort of starting fresh.

**Current Job - Cons:**

1. Layoff risks: The company recently went through layoffs, and I’ve seen colleagues get let go with no warning (though they were compensated). While things seem stable now, I’m worried my turn might come.
2. Uninspiring work: My current project is boring, and while I don’t hate it, it doesn’t excite me.
3. Downtime: There are days with little to do. This gives me free time for personal interests, but as someone in a creative field, it can also feel frustrating.

**The Offer:**

* The new company is offering $5,500 USD per month for a remote senior role. After taxes, I’d have $3,800 USD to use freely.
* It’s a much smaller company (11-50 employees), and I’d be working as a contractor.
* I asked the CTO about their business model, and he explained:“The core business model is B2B selling to schools and districts in LATAM and the US. We do have a small amount of B2C revenue, and I expect that to increase as a percentage of our revenue as we ramp up our marketing efforts in 2025.”
* The project is very interesting, it's AI driven.

**My Dilemma:**

* If I stay at my current job, I’m worried about the possibility of layoffs.
* If I take the new job, I’m concerned about the stability of a smaller company’s revenue and whether the move is worth the risk.

**Additional Info:**

* The higher pay is appealing, especially since I’m confident I can handle the senior role’s responsibilities.
* However, leaving the comfort and benefits of a larger company is scary, especially for a smaller and potentially riskier venture.

**TL;DR:** I’m torn between staying at my current job (stable but uninspiring) or taking a higher-paying senior role at a smaller company that might be less stable. What would you do in my situation? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!"
"New in ETF, take a look to my planned portfolio ",ETFs,1hci9qs,2024-12-12 05:32:51,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hci9qs/new_in_etf_take_a_look_to_my_planned_portfolio/,Rufusthe13thapostol,,"Hi there,

I've been considering long-term investments and have been researching the ideal ETF mix. As a resident of the Netherlands, I've focused on tax-efficient options. I've narrowed it down to two main groups:

**Group 1:**

* **SPYL:** Tracks the S&P 500, offers dividend reinvestment, and is tax-efficient.
* **EMB:** Emerging market bond. It will offer higher returns, but with more risk.
* **DTLE:** 20+ year US Treasury bonds, euro-hedged.
* **MBWO:** Euro-denominated global bonds. This group provides a balanced mix of US equities and long-term bonds, suitable for diversification.

**Group 2:**

* **AMUNDI ACRP SRI 0-3:** Short-term, socially responsible bonds with low risk.
* **XEON X EUR OVERNIGHT RATE SWAP 1C:** Fixed-income based on swaps, offering lower volatility.
* **DTLE ISHARES USD TRES 20+ EUR-H-D:** Similar to Group 1, with US Treasury bonds euro-hedged.
* **IBCQ ISHARES GLB CORP BD EUR-H:** Euro-hedged global corporate bonds. This group is more conservative, focused on fixed income and capital preservation.

**Analysis:**

* **Risk/Return:** Group 1 has higher risk due to equities (SPYL) and long-term bonds (DTLE), but also higher potential returns. Group 2 is more stable with lower risk but limited returns.
* **Taxation:** Both groups use Irish-domiciled ETFs, which are tax-efficient in the Netherlands. Group 1 benefits from dividend reinvestment in SPYL.
* **Investment Horizon:** For long-term growth, Group 1 is more suitable due to equities and longer-term bonds. For a conservative approach, Group 2 is better.

ETF	         % ivestment)

SPYL	40%	

MBWO	30%	

DTLE	20%	

EMB	10%	

**Summary:** Group 1 offers a more balanced and growth-oriented approach, while Group 2 is more conservative and focused on preserving capital. I´m more inclined to group 1, but I will hear any advice!"

This allowed AUD/JPY and USD/JPY to deliver strong bounce from key support levels, as the yen weakened during a risk-on session for FX and commodities.

The Politburo said on Monday that China will switch to an “appropriately loose” monetary policy in 2025, marking the first time it has eased its stance since the GFC. Unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments will be stepped up, to focus on boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand.

China’s indices rallied on the announcement, sending Hang Seng futures over 8% higher from Monday’s low while China A50 futures gained over 6% from the week’s low. The yuan was stable which prevented USD/CNH from breaking above 7.3, in turn allowing AUD/USD to rally from its 2022 trend support level.

 

AUD/USD and NZD/USD were the strongest FX majors during a risk-on day while the Japanese yen was the weakest. This could see AUD/JPY and USD/JPY gain further traction for bulls over the near term before their anticipated next legs lower begin.

# Economic events in focus (AEDT)

It is highly unlikely the RBA will cut rates today, despite growing excitement that they will cut three times next year, beginning in April. They’ll want to see tomorrow’s jobs and quarterly CPI figures in January before entertaining any such thoughts, but something to look out for in their statement is if or how they acknowledge last week’s weak GDP figures. If they do, it could pull forward expectations of a cut to Q1 a tad and unwind some of yesterday’s gains on AUD/USD.

 

* 10:50 – JP GDP external demand (Q4), money supply (Nov)
* 11:30 – AU business confidence (NAB)
* 14:00 – CN trade balance (Nov)
* **14:30 – RBA interest rate decision (no change expected)**
* 14:35 – JP 5-year JGB
* 17:00 – JP machine tool orders (Nov)

# AUD/JPY technical analysis

Two weeks ago, I outlined a bearish scenario for AUD/JPY based on price action clues on the weekly chart. Not that I’m complaining, but the bearish move arrived sooner than I had anticipated (within 24 hours of the video, to be exact). But the market has clearly topped out for now and could be headed for the August low, a break beneath which brings the 86 handle into focus near the 2021 high / 2023 low.

Yet bullish mean reversion is underway, having formed a bullish engulfing day around a weekly VPOC (volume point of control). Bulls could seek dips within Monday’s range to target the 20-day EMA (98.42) or 50-day EMA (99.21) near the original breakout level of 99.44.

Alternatively, bears could wait for evidence of a swing high to form on a lower timeframe around forementioned resistance levels, in anticipation of its next leg lower once momentum realigns with the move on the weekly chart.

https://preview.redd.it/fvux7yd8iw5e1.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c93b53f5a31364c6db24173b5acd4131d3cc488

# USD/JPY technical analysis:

Last Wednesday I warned of an incoming bounce on USD/JPY. It reached my weekly pivot-point target of 151.3 but 152 is still up for the taking, with prices just 70-ips beneath the level. Yet Monday’s price action now has me wondering whether another bounce could exceed 152 before USD/JPY embarks on its next leg lower.  

A higher low formed on Friday in the form of a Rickshaw man doji, perfectly at the August high and October VPOC. Bullish range expansion kicked in on Monday. Also note that prices are now testing the top of last week’s spinning top doji.

 

* Like AUD/JPY, bulls could seek dips within Monday’s range on USD/JPY in anticipation of another leg higher. A break above 152 brings the 153.28 low into focus.
* Given the daily RSI (2) is approaching overbought, bears could also watch for evidence of a swing high around 152, 153-153.28 in anticipation of its next leg lower.

""The Project represents a strong combination of high-margin production and modest capital requirements, with the opportunity for significant resource growth in the future.""*

*""This PEA demonstrates Perron's early potential based on a database close date of June 30****th****, 2024. Since the closing of the database, drilling has continued at depth and laterally and has already shown excellent high-grade intercepts beyond the currently defined mineral resource. This successful additional drilling demonstrates the continuation of mineralization and the upside potential for further resource and mine life additions in the future as we progress exploration.""*

*\*Inclusive of gold sales net of royalty ($62M) in pre-production period*

1. The PEA is preliminary in nature and is based, in part, on Inferred Mineral Resources. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the economic forecasts on which the PEA is based will be realized.
2. The economic analysis of the project was carried out using a discounted cash flow approach on a pre-tax and after-tax basis with a discount rate of 5%.
3. Revenue was based on a long-term gold price of $2,000/oz in USD.
4. Cost estimates were prepared in C$.
5. An exchange rate of 0.74 USD per 1.00 CAD was assumed.

* Underpinned by world class infrastructure, the Perron PEA demonstrates a top-tier high margin gold mining operation in the stable jurisdiction of Quebec, Canada. The Project is located within the prolific Abitibi region, one of the most prolific gold belts in the world.
* The PEA results confirm that Perron has the potential to be a stand-alone and highly profitable operation with an excellent internal rate of return (IRR) and after-tax net present value (NPV) at a range of gold prices.
* The PEA shows that Perron has the potential to be a mine with limited environmental impact, utilizing the mined out open pits to store tailings and therefore avoiding the construction of a tailings management facility.

**Mining**

The mine will be operated as a mechanized underground operation, which will be complemented by open pit production. The mine will have an overall average production rate of 1,750 tpd of mineralized material over a 10-year production period that is preceded by a 2-year pre-production period.

The selected underground mining method is longitudinal longhole stoping with cemented rockfill. Stope dimensions average 17.5 m in length, 25 m in height, and 5.7 m in width (LOM average) with a minimum mining width of 3.0 m. The different sectors of the mine will be accessed via ramps and drifts to allow the efficient circulation of mobile mining equipment and to satisfy ventilation and emergency egress requirements. Mineralized material will be extracted using a fleet of owner-operated equipment that includes 10 tonne LHDs and 42 tonne haul trucks.

Five open pits are included in the mine plan and utilize conventional truck and shovel mining that will be executed by a contractor. The pits will begin to be mined in the preproduction period, with material completely extracted by year 4 as they are sequenced such that they can be used to manage all tailings generated by the mill.

**Processing**

A total of 1,750 tpd of material will be processed in a plant that consists of primary crushing, followed by a grinding circuit consisting of a semi-autogenous grinding mill of 5.5 m diameter x 1.8 m long in an opened circuit and a ball mill of 4.0 m diameter x 6.7 m long in a closed circuit with cyclones - SABC circuit. A gravity circuit followed by leaching will recover coarse gold from the cyclone underflow, while the cyclone overflow, at a P80=74 microns, is treated in a six (6) tank carbon-in-leach circuit, followed by SO2/air cyanide destruction. Gold will be recovered in an adsorption-desorption-recovery circuit and electrowinning cells, with gold room recovery and production of bullion bars.

The CIL tailings after the cyanide destruction will be pumped to a high-rate thickener to increase the slurry density to 62-64 % solid and pumped to empty pits.

The process plant gold recovery is estimated to average 95.0% over the LOM.

The process plant building will include a laboratory, mill offices, a dry and an electrical and mechanical shop.

**Infrastructure**

The Project is approximately 5 kilometers from the town of Normétal, Quebec and is accessible via a well-maintained forestry road. The Project will require construction of the following supporting infrastructure items: 1,750 tpd process plant complex, offices, dry, maintenance shop and warehouse; gatehouse; 5 kilometers of 120kV transmission lines; 120 kV main substation; final effluent water treatment plant; surface water management facility, including ditches, pond and pumping stations; service and haulage roads; potable water and sewage systems; underground mine portal, mine ventilation systems (intake and exhaust) and waste dump and overburden storage facilities. No camp will be required considering the nearby qualified labor pool.

**Workforce**

During the 18-month construction period of the mine, the workforce will peak at approximately 250 people, this is in addition to employees who would be required for open pit and underground mining and G&A.

During steady state operations, the average number of employees (mine, process plant and G&A) is estimated at 164 people, excluding contractors (open-pit mining, contract services, etc.).

**Tailings**

The tailings storage plan will take advantage of open pits that will be mined in the first half of the mine life. Process plant rejects will be thickened and pumped to the mined-out pits sequentially for permanent storage. Tailings will then consolidate over time and excess water will either be used for processing requirements or discharged to the environment once quality conditions are met. This concept aims to limit the environmental impact of the Perron Project, to limit the risks related to traditional Tailings Management Facility (TMF) stability, to simplify short-term and long-term monitoring and to greatly reduce the capital and operating costs related to tailings management.

**Capital Expenditure**

The total initial construction capital expenditure (""CAPEX"") is forecasted at $229M after accounting for $62M in gold sales revenues (pre-production credits). Capitalized mine development prior to commercial production is expected to be approximately $112M, comprised of $38M related to open pit mining and $74M related to underground mining. The majority of the capitalized open pit mining is driven by the strategic decision to complete the mining of a small open pit in the pre-production period in order to be able to start disposing tailings at the commissioning of the process plant. The construction capital accounts for the site development, water treatment and infrastructure area including a truck shop, warehouse and an administration facility. Additionally, the capital estimate includes $15.1M of EPCM and indirect costs and a contingency of $25M.

Quotations from reputable suppliers were obtained for most of the large and high-cost equipment required for the plant, mine and site infrastructure. For other equipment and supplies, cost estimates were based on comparable projects, historical data or derived through consultants' in-house databases.

*Table 6: Capital Expenditure*

The sustaining capex (""SUSEX"") is estimated to be $238M, including $8M of closure and rehabilitation costs. Underground mining SUSEX is earmarked for mining development, additional equipment, replacement units, and major repairs. Other sustaining capex captures in-pits tailings storage, infrastructures and G&A.

**Operating Costs**

Life of Mine (LOM) total operating cost is estimated at US$633 per ounce of gold produced, as summarized below. The LOM total AISC is estimated to be US$807 per ounce of gold produced based on average annual gold production of 101,000 ounces over the 10 years of mine life. This cost structure places the Project in the bottom quartile of the global gold cost curve, which is mostly due to the high-grade nature of the mineralized material and to the simplicity of mining.

*Table 8: Operating Costs*

https://preview.redd.it/fwanx298xt5e1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=11bfba3f22a9ee6c299c5991b628b9bffefa2b4b

 

**Financial Analysis**

At base case gold price of US$2,000/oz and exchange rate of 1.35, the Project generates after-tax Net Present Value (""NPV"") of $525M using 5% discount rate and an after-tax Internal Rate of Return (""IRR"") of 40.2% with a payback period of 1.8 years from the commencement of commercial production. The Project generates cumulative free cash flow of $767M and average annual free cash flow of $100M over the 10 years production period. Total taxes payable over LOM at the base case gold price is $566M.

The PEA financial economic analysis is significantly influenced by gold prices. At spot prices of US$2,600/Au oz and exchange rate of 1.39, the Project generates an after-tax NPV of $914M and an after-tax IRR of 59.7% with a payback period of 1.2 years. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the gold price, CAPEX, overall OPEX and exchange rate.

**Permitting and Environment**

The opening and operation of a mine that has a production capacity equal to or less than 2,000 tonnes per day is not subjected to an environmental impact assessment (""EIA"") according to chapter Q-2 of the *Environmental Quality Act* (""EQA"") for the emission of a ministerial decree. As modelled in the PEA, the Perron Project would therefore not submit to processes of and EIA and to the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (''BAPE''), as per current regulation, as the estimated production of 1,750 tonnes per day is below the threshold. However, an application for a ministerial authorization will need to be submitted to the Ministère de l'Environnement, de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, de la Faune et des Parcs (''MELCCFP''). Studies will be required as part of this application including, hydrological studies, hydrogeological and geochemical analysis, soil quality analysis, surface water, groundwater and sediment quality, characterization of the natural environment, including water bodies, wetlands, species with special status and wildlife inventories for certain species.

The acquisition of baseline environmental knowledge on the Perron property began several years ago and is still ongoing today. An environmental scoping study has been carried out, and to date, no major environmental issues have been identified in the work undertaken. Additional environmental work is planned to be carried out in 2025 such as a geochemical characterization program, various environmental inventories and social engagement with the local stakeholders.

**Stakeholder Engagement**

The aboriginal community concerned by Amex's activities is the Abitibiwinni First Nation which is an Algonquin First Nation residing primarily in the community of Pikogan in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region. The Pikogan community, also called Abitibiwinni, is located three (3) kilometers from the town of Amos on the west bank of the Harricana River. The Perron project is located on a part of the ancestral territory of the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation. A relationship of trust and respect has been built with the Abitibiwinni First Nation Council over the years by demonstrating transparency and consideration. With respect to local communities near the project, Normétal, Valcanton and Saint-Lambert are the main municipalities surrounding the Perron project.

Amex has always prioritized engaging stakeholders and implementing communication and consultation plans. Communication plans include a summary of the work completed on the property every six months as well as the company's orientations for the coming months.

Active participation in the communities through sponsorship, investment, etc. is part of AMEX's core values and aids in fostering good long-term relationships. AMEX will continue consulting, supporting and informing all stakeholders at all stages of the project development.

**Exploration Update**

The PEA was based upon the Mineral Resource Estimate (""MRE"") for which the drill database was closed on June 30, 2024 ([please see press release dated September 5, 2024](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/O3gqqh7Mrp)). Since this date, Amex has drilled approximately a further 28,000 m on the Perron Property. This drilling has been demonstrating the growth potential that exists across several zones at Perron.

The Company has displayed in recent months that the High Grade Zone (""HGZ"") is open not only at depth but also remains open in certain areas close to surface. The Denise Zone has fantastic potential for expansion in multiple directions, which is significant given its proximity to the HGZ. The latest press release ([dated November 6, 2024](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PLpnnsLwGo)) showed the growth potential of several zones and that exceptionally high-grade gold can be found across the entirety of the Perron Property.

Since obtaining the MRE, the Amex Exploration team has been optimizing drill planning to target expansion of the open pit and underground stope shapes identified in the resource. Numerous areas across the project have been outlined for expansion due to a lack of drilling. With the PEA now in hand, drill planning will be further refined to prioritize the growth of economic ounces and importantly identify where additional tonnage can be added to the earlier years of the mine life to further enhance the mine's optimization.

*Figure 8: Example (from the HGZ) to display that drilling completed after the database cutoff of June 30, 2024 has the potential to add economic stopes to the existing resource (Assays from PE-24-797 fall outside current PEA stopes)*

**Mineral Resource Estimate**

The Perron Project hosts mineral resources as detailed in the NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate with an effective date of September 5, 2024, which can be found on SEDAR+. The mineral resources that have flowed to the mine plan are contained within five different zones (High Grade, Denise, Gratien, Grey Cat and Team) over a strike length of 2,900 meters and span from surface to a depth of approximately 1,400 meters. Each zone is characterized by multiple tabular panels, which mainly trend ENE and dip vertically to sub-vertically.

*Table 11: Summary of Mineral Resources*

|All Zones|Open Pit Constrained|UG stopes|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|COG 0.42 Au g/t|COG 1.29 Au g/t|||
|Tonnes|Au gpt|Au oz.|Tonnes|
|Measured|131,240|1.40|5,890|
|Indicated|706,600|1.80|40,780|
|Indicated+Measured|837,840|1.73|46,670|
|Inferred|996,470|2.01|64,420|

 

1. The mineral resource estimate is compliant with CIM 2019 standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves.
2. Resources are presented undiluted and in situ and are considered to have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The resources at surface are constrained by pit optimization surfaces and the underground resources are constrained by mineable shapes.
3. The database comprised a total of 1,533 drill holes for 547,361 metres of drilling (which includes historical drilling completed by previous operators) in the extent of the mineral resource, of which (312,051.20 metres) 264,462 samples were assayed as of June 30th, 2024, grid spacing are variable (The Genesis file is Amex\_24 Aout 2024\_MR.gnft and where the database file is BD\_AMEX\_08 Jul 2024\_MR.accdb).
4. All NQ core assays reported by AMEX were obtained by analytical methods described below under ""QA&QC"".
5. Geological interpretation of the deposits was based on lithologies, mineralized zones orientation and the mineral observations. Each zone has its own characteristic of mineral occurrence and amount of free gold.
6. Interpretation was initially made from cross-sections at intervals, and then completed in GENESIS, a modelling software, where selections of mineralization intervals were combined to generate mineralization wireframes. Envelopes are generally subvertical with various plunges.
7. The mineral resource estimate encompasses a total of 189 envelopes, sub-vertical gold-bearing envelopes/domains each defined by individual wireframes with a minimum true thickness of 2.0 metres.
8. Samples were composited within the mineralization envelopes into 1.0 metre length composites. A value of zero grade was applied in cases of core not assayed.
9. High grade capping was done on composite data and established using a statistical analysis on a per-zone basis for gold. Capping varied from 5 g/t Au to 200 g/t Au and was applied on composites within each specific envelope.
10. Density values were applied on the different mineralized zones (t/m3) varied from 2.67 to 2.83 from core measurement.
11. Inverse distance squared grade estimation is used. The trial of Ordinary Kriging (OK) was rejected due to smearing and non-effective representation of high-grade areas.
12. Most of the estimates are based on a block dimension of 2m North, 2m East and 2m height and estimation parameters determined by variography. The High-Grade zone has blocks of 2.5m East x 5m Z (Elevation) x 0.5m North.
13. Estimates use metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). Metal contents are presented in troy ounces (metric tonne x grade / 31.10348).
14. GoldMinds is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue not reported in the technical report, that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate.

**CEO Commentary:**

*""This PEA marks an important milestone for AMEX and reaffirms our view that our fully owned Perron Project is a high-quality asset and has the potential of being a highly profitable stand-alone mining operation with minimal environmental impact"" said Victor Cantore, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMEX Exploration. ""The Project represents a strong combination of high-margin production and modest capital requirements, with the opportunity for significant resource growth in the future.""*

*""This PEA demonstrates Perron's early potential based on a database close date of June 30****th****, 2024. Since the closing of the database, drilling has continued at depth and laterally and has already shown excellent high-grade intercepts beyond the currently defined mineral resource. This successful additional drilling demonstrates the continuation of mineralization and the upside potential for further resource and mine life additions in the future as we progress exploration.""*

1. The PEA is preliminary in nature and is based, in part, on Inferred Mineral Resources. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the economic forecasts on which the PEA is based will be realized.
2. The economic analysis of the project was carried out using a discounted cash flow approach on a pre-tax and after-tax basis with a discount rate of 5%.
3. Revenue was based on a long-term gold price of $2,000/oz in USD.
4. Cost estimates were prepared in C$.
5. An exchange rate of 0.74 USD per 1.00 CAD was assumed.

* Underpinned by world class infrastructure, the Perron PEA demonstrates a top-tier high margin gold mining operation in the stable jurisdiction of Quebec, Canada. The Project is located within the prolific Abitibi region, one of the most prolific gold belts in the world.
* The PEA results confirm that Perron has the potential to be a stand-alone and highly profitable operation with an excellent internal rate of return (IRR) and after-tax net present value (NPV) at a range of gold prices.
* The PEA shows that Perron has the potential to be a mine with limited environmental impact, utilizing the mined out open pits to store tailings and therefore avoiding the construction of a tailings management facility.

**Mining**

The mine will be operated as a mechanized underground operation, which will be complemented by open pit production. The mine will have an overall average production rate of 1,750 tpd of mineralized material over a 10-year production period that is preceded by a 2-year pre-production period.

The selected underground mining method is longitudinal longhole stoping with cemented rockfill. Stope dimensions average 17.5 m in length, 25 m in height, and 5.7 m in width (LOM average) with a minimum mining width of 3.0 m. The different sectors of the mine will be accessed via ramps and drifts to allow the efficient circulation of mobile mining equipment and to satisfy ventilation and emergency egress requirements. Mineralized material will be extracted using a fleet of owner-operated equipment that includes 10 tonne LHDs and 42 tonne haul trucks.

Five open pits are included in the mine plan and utilize conventional truck and shovel mining that will be executed by a contractor. The pits will begin to be mined in the preproduction period, with material completely extracted by year 4 as they are sequenced such that they can be used to manage all tailings generated by the mill.

**Processing**

A total of 1,750 tpd of material will be processed in a plant that consists of primary crushing, followed by a grinding circuit consisting of a semi-autogenous grinding mill of 5.5 m diameter x 1.8 m long in an opened circuit and a ball mill of 4.0 m diameter x 6.7 m long in a closed circuit with cyclones - SABC circuit. A gravity circuit followed by leaching will recover coarse gold from the cyclone underflow, while the cyclone overflow, at a P80=74 microns, is treated in a six (6) tank carbon-in-leach circuit, followed by SO2/air cyanide destruction. Gold will be recovered in an adsorption-desorption-recovery circuit and electrowinning cells, with gold room recovery and production of bullion bars.

The CIL tailings after the cyanide destruction will be pumped to a high-rate thickener to increase the slurry density to 62-64 % solid and pumped to empty pits.

The process plant gold recovery is estimated to average 95.0% over the LOM.

The process plant building will include a laboratory, mill offices, a dry and an electrical and mechanical shop.

**Infrastructure**

The Project is approximately 5 kilometers from the town of Normétal, Quebec and is accessible via a well-maintained forestry road. The Project will require construction of the following supporting infrastructure items: 1,750 tpd process plant complex, offices, dry, maintenance shop and warehouse; gatehouse; 5 kilometers of 120kV transmission lines; 120 kV main substation; final effluent water treatment plant; surface water management facility, including ditches, pond and pumping stations; service and haulage roads; potable water and sewage systems; underground mine portal, mine ventilation systems (intake and exhaust) and waste dump and overburden storage facilities. No camp will be required considering the nearby qualified labor pool.

**Workforce**

During the 18-month construction period of the mine, the workforce will peak at approximately 250 people, this is in addition to employees who would be required for open pit and underground mining and G&A.

During steady state operations, the average number of employees (mine, process plant and G&A) is estimated at 164 people, excluding contractors (open-pit mining, contract services, etc.).

**Tailings**

The tailings storage plan will take advantage of open pits that will be mined in the first half of the mine life. Process plant rejects will be thickened and pumped to the mined-out pits sequentially for permanent storage. Tailings will then consolidate over time and excess water will either be used for processing requirements or discharged to the environment once quality conditions are met. This concept aims to limit the environmental impact of the Perron Project, to limit the risks related to traditional Tailings Management Facility (TMF) stability, to simplify short-term and long-term monitoring and to greatly reduce the capital and operating costs related to tailings management.

**Capital Expenditure**

The total initial construction capital expenditure (""CAPEX"") is forecasted at $229M after accounting for $62M in gold sales revenues (pre-production credits). Capitalized mine development prior to commercial production is expected to be approximately $112M, comprised of $38M related to open pit mining and $74M related to underground mining. The majority of the capitalized open pit mining is driven by the strategic decision to complete the mining of a small open pit in the pre-production period in order to be able to start disposing tailings at the commissioning of the process plant. The construction capital accounts for the site development, water treatment and infrastructure area including a truck shop, warehouse and an administration facility. Additionally, the capital estimate includes $15.1M of EPCM and indirect costs and a contingency of $25M.

Quotations from reputable suppliers were obtained for most of the large and high-cost equipment required for the plant, mine and site infrastructure. For other equipment and supplies, cost estimates were based on comparable projects, historical data or derived through consultants' in-house databases.

*Table 6: Capital Expenditure*

The sustaining capex (""SUSEX"") is estimated to be $238M, including $8M of closure and rehabilitation costs. Underground mining SUSEX is earmarked for mining development, additional equipment, replacement units, and major repairs. Other sustaining capex captures in-pits tailings storage, infrastructures and G&A.

**Operating Costs**

Life of Mine (LOM) total operating cost is estimated at US$633 per ounce of gold produced, as summarized below. The LOM total AISC is estimated to be US$807 per ounce of gold produced based on average annual gold production of 101,000 ounces over the 10 years of mine life. This cost structure places the Project in the bottom quartile of the global gold cost curve, which is mostly due to the high-grade nature of the mineralized material and to the simplicity of mining.

*Table 8: Operating Costs*

https://preview.redd.it/y23ejeq0xt5e1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93686558b3b5e2202a5502f6540a489fd1a0bd0

 

**Financial Analysis**

At base case gold price of US$2,000/oz and exchange rate of 1.35, the Project generates after-tax Net Present Value (""NPV"") of $525M using 5% discount rate and an after-tax Internal Rate of Return (""IRR"") of 40.2% with a payback period of 1.8 years from the commencement of commercial production. The Project generates cumulative free cash flow of $767M and average annual free cash flow of $100M over the 10 years production period. Total taxes payable over LOM at the base case gold price is $566M.

The PEA financial economic analysis is significantly influenced by gold prices. At spot prices of US$2,600/Au oz and exchange rate of 1.39, the Project generates an after-tax NPV of $914M and an after-tax IRR of 59.7% with a payback period of 1.2 years. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the gold price, CAPEX, overall OPEX and exchange rate.

**Permitting and Environment**

The opening and operation of a mine that has a production capacity equal to or less than 2,000 tonnes per day is not subjected to an environmental impact assessment (""EIA"") according to chapter Q-2 of the *Environmental Quality Act* (""EQA"") for the emission of a ministerial decree. As modelled in the PEA, the Perron Project would therefore not submit to processes of and EIA and to the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (''BAPE''), as per current regulation, as the estimated production of 1,750 tonnes per day is below the threshold. However, an application for a ministerial authorization will need to be submitted to the Ministère de l'Environnement, de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, de la Faune et des Parcs (''MELCCFP''). Studies will be required as part of this application including, hydrological studies, hydrogeological and geochemical analysis, soil quality analysis, surface water, groundwater and sediment quality, characterization of the natural environment, including water bodies, wetlands, species with special status and wildlife inventories for certain species.

The acquisition of baseline environmental knowledge on the Perron property began several years ago and is still ongoing today. An environmental scoping study has been carried out, and to date, no major environmental issues have been identified in the work undertaken. Additional environmental work is planned to be carried out in 2025 such as a geochemical characterization program, various environmental inventories and social engagement with the local stakeholders.

**Stakeholder Engagement**

The aboriginal community concerned by Amex's activities is the Abitibiwinni First Nation which is an Algonquin First Nation residing primarily in the community of Pikogan in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region. The Pikogan community, also called Abitibiwinni, is located three (3) kilometers from the town of Amos on the west bank of the Harricana River. The Perron project is located on a part of the ancestral territory of the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation. A relationship of trust and respect has been built with the Abitibiwinni First Nation Council over the years by demonstrating transparency and consideration. With respect to local communities near the project, Normétal, Valcanton and Saint-Lambert are the main municipalities surrounding the Perron project.

Amex has always prioritized engaging stakeholders and implementing communication and consultation plans. Communication plans include a summary of the work completed on the property every six months as well as the company's orientations for the coming months.

Active participation in the communities through sponsorship, investment, etc. is part of AMEX's core values and aids in fostering good long-term relationships. AMEX will continue consulting, supporting and informing all stakeholders at all stages of the project development.

**Exploration Update**

The PEA was based upon the Mineral Resource Estimate (""MRE"") for which the drill database was closed on June 30, 2024 ([please see press release dated September 5, 2024](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/DZGLbUMLoE)). Since this date, Amex has drilled approximately a further 28,000 m on the Perron Property. This drilling has been demonstrating the growth potential that exists across several zones at Perron.

The Company has displayed in recent months that the High Grade Zone (""HGZ"") is open not only at depth but also remains open in certain areas close to surface. The Denise Zone has fantastic potential for expansion in multiple directions, which is significant given its proximity to the HGZ. The latest press release ([dated November 6, 2024](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/rvWaotxpVL)) showed the growth potential of several zones and that exceptionally high-grade gold can be found across the entirety of the Perron Property.

Since obtaining the MRE, the Amex Exploration team has been optimizing drill planning to target expansion of the open pit and underground stope shapes identified in the resource. Numerous areas across the project have been outlined for expansion due to a lack of drilling. With the PEA now in hand, drill planning will be further refined to prioritize the growth of economic ounces and importantly identify where additional tonnage can be added to the earlier years of the mine life to further enhance the mine's optimization.

*Figure 8: Example (from the HGZ) to display that drilling completed after the database cutoff of June 30, 2024 has the potential to add economic stopes to the existing resource (Assays from PE-24-797 fall outside current PEA stopes)*

**Mineral Resource Estimate**

The Perron Project hosts mineral resources as detailed in the NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate with an effective date of September 5, 2024, which can be found on SEDAR+. The mineral resources that have flowed to the mine plan are contained within five different zones (High Grade, Denise, Gratien, Grey Cat and Team) over a strike length of 2,900 meters and span from surface to a depth of approximately 1,400 meters. Each zone is characterized by multiple tabular panels, which mainly trend ENE and dip vertically to sub-vertically.

*Table 11: Summary of Mineral Resources*

|All Zones|Open Pit Constrained|UG stopes|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|COG 0.42 Au g/t|COG 1.29 Au g/t|||
|Tonnes|Au gpt|Au oz.|Tonnes|
|Measured|131,240|1.40|5,890|
|Indicated|706,600|1.80|40,780|
|Indicated+Measured|837,840|1.73|46,670|
|Inferred|996,470|2.01|64,420|

 

1. The mineral resource estimate is compliant with CIM 2019 standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves.
2. Resources are presented undiluted and in situ and are considered to have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The resources at surface are constrained by pit optimization surfaces and the underground resources are constrained by mineable shapes.
3. The database comprised a total of 1,533 drill holes for 547,361 metres of drilling (which includes historical drilling completed by previous operators) in the extent of the mineral resource, of which (312,051.20 metres) 264,462 samples were assayed as of June 30th, 2024, grid spacing are variable (The Genesis file is Amex\_24 Aout 2024\_MR.gnft and where the database file is BD\_AMEX\_08 Jul 2024\_MR.accdb).
4. All NQ core assays reported by AMEX were obtained by analytical methods described below under ""QA&QC"".
5. Geological interpretation of the deposits was based on lithologies, mineralized zones orientation and the mineral observations. Each zone has its own characteristic of mineral occurrence and amount of free gold.
6. Interpretation was initially made from cross-sections at intervals, and then completed in GENESIS, a modelling software, where selections of mineralization intervals were combined to generate mineralization wireframes. Envelopes are generally subvertical with various plunges.
7. The mineral resource estimate encompasses a total of 189 envelopes, sub-vertical gold-bearing envelopes/domains each defined by individual wireframes with a minimum true thickness of 2.0 metres.
8. Samples were composited within the mineralization envelopes into 1.0 metre length composites. A value of zero grade was applied in cases of core not assayed.
9. High grade capping was done on composite data and established using a statistical analysis on a per-zone basis for gold. Capping varied from 5 g/t Au to 200 g/t Au and was applied on composites within each specific envelope.
10. Density values were applied on the different mineralized zones (t/m3) varied from 2.67 to 2.83 from core measurement.
11. Inverse distance squared grade estimation is used. The trial of Ordinary Kriging (OK) was rejected due to smearing and non-effective representation of high-grade areas.
12. Most of the estimates are based on a block dimension of 2m North, 2m East and 2m height and estimation parameters determined by variography. The High-Grade zone has blocks of 2.5m East x 5m Z (Elevation) x 0.5m North.
13. Estimates use metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). Metal contents are presented in troy ounces (metric tonne x grade / 31.10348).
14. GoldMinds is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue not reported in the technical report, that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate.
