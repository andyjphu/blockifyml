Looking for the immigration officer I met on King AbdulAziz International Airport,Jeddah,1i5tci7,2025-01-20 10:55:49,26,0.89,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeddah/comments/1i5tci7/looking_for_the_immigration_officer_i_met_on_king/,Mindless-Term2665,Help Needed,"On the 16th of January, I had the privilege of meeting a kind-hearted and cheerful immigration officer at King Abdul-Aziz International Airport. It was a tough day for my siblings and me - we had just said a tearful goodbye to our mother, and our emotions were written all over our faces.

He lightened the mood by cracking jokes. He even paused to ask about the book I was holding, listened as I shared how much I loved it, and took a picture of it.

If by any chance you come across this, I’d love the opportunity to thank you properly for your kindness and the warmth.

PS.  You might remember me - I was the girl in the lavender-colored abaya. Below is the book you asked me about.

FAQ

Q: Why does Photon/Dex/Bull X show a top holder of 8%?

A: That’s the liquidity pool (LP)! Since our LP is CPMM and Raydium’s vaults are currently unsupported for detection, the LP shows up as a top holder without being labeled as such. We are working on resolving the issue!

___  
**Where I left off**  
After easily earning the Mineral Badge, “Petrel” managed to take out my Pinsir with an ill-timed Explosion.  If I had just remembered that I brought Weepinbell to that fight, we might have stayed deathless, ugh.  [Team: Shadow Complex/Poliwhirl (33), Popeye/Poliwrath (35), Lode Runner/Venomoth (33), Wonder Boy/Hitmontop (33), MUSCLE “Metroid”/Machoke (33), and Plok!/Machoke (33).](https://i.imgur.com/2OcLiLF.png)  
___  
**The Poli-cule**  
Well, the team wasn’t going to stay that way for long.  Lode Runner was the only one that stayed while RoboCop/Bayleef, AnthrWirld/Poliwag, VIII-BitNG/Heracross, Adv.Island/Ledyba, and Jungle Hunt/Gloom got withdrawn.  They weren’t all staying for Clair, but I wanted a more diverse team to take on Rt. 44’s trainers.  (Though most of them were quite a few levels behind, so there was a lot of switching.)  Sad side note: Jungle Hunt is way better than Canimals in DVs + Vileplume’s Base SpAt is a little bit better than Victreebel’s.  So I guess that means Canimals is officially retired now...  Assuming nothing goes wrong.  

Jungle Hunt and AnthrWirld help us get past the Bird Keeper unscathed, letting us arrive at Ice Path, which once again brings us to 9 tokens.  Not much of note happened in there, but since Adv.Island also learned Ice Punch, he got the NeverMeltIce.  In Blackthorn, I got my final Poliwag, which got named after the spooky *American McGee’s Alice*.  (McGeeAlice in-game)  What a fitting name for the current month!  

Route 45 to the South is also a token area, so I just got to hopping on down towards Rt. 27.  Well, I had to go to Cherrygrove first to pull out the Headbutting Bud Redhed/Skiploom, but once I did I could knock the sleepy Xargon/Exeggcute from a tree and get a token from Tohjo Falls.  

On the way back I visited Goldenrod Department Store’s TM Selection one last time in preparation for the fight.  (I even got some extra so I wouldn’t have to turn around at the League, heh.)  Back in Blackthorn, RoboCop evolved while we faced Clair’s cronies! (Heh, alliteration!)  
___  
**VS Clair**  
Her ace level is 40, but Owliver’s is 38...  Y’know what?  I’m gonna have RoboCop match the Ace’s level for once!  Team: RoboCop (40+Miracle Seed), Bud Redhed/Jumpluff (37+”Cheri”), AnthrWirld/Poliwrath (37+Quick Claw), ShdwComplx/Poliwrath (37+Pink Bow), Popeye (37+”Cheri”), Adv.Island/Ledian (37+NeverMeltIce). Popeye doesn’t join the Ice Punch crew because I like his moveset too much, but he was helpful by passing on Pokerus to everyone else.  

AnthrWirld starts us off, putting both Dragonair #1 and #2 to sleep before taking them out with Ice Punches.  The first one even got crit OHKO’d, heh!  Since Clair most likely sent out the one with Thunderbolt second, I had AnthrWirld go right for Ice Punch on the third Dragonair.  That got her paralyzed, though.  After a DragonBreath that didn’t do much, the second Ice Punch took it out.  

Adv.Island came out to face Kingdra first, setting up Reflect for Hyper Beam while Kingdra... used SmokeScreen, ugh.  There goes Baton Pass...  Ice Punch did a little bit, but Kingdra spat out more smoke, so I had Adv.Island set up a Light Screen.  Perfect timing, because Kingdra used Surf!  

I did a normal swap to Bud Redhed, who dodged another SmokeScreen before landing Sleep Powder.  He set up Leech Seed and tried Mega Drain before Kingdra woke up and responded with a critical DragonBreath, ack!  I missed when Reflect faded, but Light Screen faded here, right when Leech Seed brought Kingdra to yellow health.  I swapped to Popeye after that, but she used Hyper Potion, ugh.  

Kingdra went first with SmokeScreen, making Popeye’s Hypnosis miss, so I swapped to ShdwComplx instead.  The smoke as she swapped in failed, but the second one didn’t.  Luckily, her Hypnosis still landed, but Clair used a Full Heal and Body Slam missed.  Kingdra went first with Hyper Beam, halving ShdwComplx’s HP.  Body Slam managed to land... but Kingdra held on by a sliver of health!  Well, it didn’t matter, Kingdra died to Leech Seed while it was recharging.  

I guess I didn’t need RoboCop’s help against the [Thunderbolt!Dragonair after all.](https://i.imgur.com/hBDPJz2.png)  Oh boy, all that SmokeScreen sure sucked, though!  
___  
**To victory!**  
With the Gym Battle over, the extra Poliwrath were going to get deposited... but I needed Whirlpool, so the weakest link (ShdwComplx) got to learn it.  Dragon’s Den is another token area, so I just headed to meet the Sage and inform him that I don’t want his dragon...  But I forgot his feigns deafness if you say the *really* bad answers.  Though I did play around with one answer: “Strong Pokemon.  Weak Pokemon.  Which is more important?”  “Well, I can’t use any strong pokemon here, so...” (Cue the team glaring at Giana! 😆)  

Elm called after I left, so I visited him to get the Master Ball!  And I do happen to have one encounter remaining...  Bud Redhed wound up knocking another Exeggcute out of a tree on Rt. 26, and Google Sheets named her My Melody!  Well, at least the shade of pink matches the hood.  I’m sure Hello Kitty will be happy to have a fellow Sanrio character in the box, too.  

After turning around to get my Rival Team in order (and changing the day to Sunday, because I kept forgetting something, ugh), I made my way to Victory Road, which holds Token #13.  Owliver, here we come!
___  
**VS Rival Owliver**  
Team: AnthrWirld (38+NeverMeltIce), Lode Runner (34+”Persim”), VIII-BitNG (34+BlackBelt), Plok!/Machoke (34+Magnet), Bug!/Pineco (34+Quick Claw), and Jungle Hunt (34+Miracle Seed).  Bug! is here for... exactly what you think he’s here for.  Everyone’s weak to Psychic without him!  

Sneasel’s Fury Cutter only did one damage to Plok!, who responded with his new Vital Throw, OHKO!  I kept him out for the Golbat, but the bat wasted no time and went right for [Wing Attack!](https://i.imgur.com/EYVFZ11.png)  Plok’s boosted ThunderPunch only took off a third of Golbat’s health, so I wound up swapping to AnthrWirld.  Wing Attack only took off a third of her health, so I tried to set up Hypnosis... but it failed twice, ugh.  

In between the whiffs, Golbat made her confused and lowered her to yellow health, so I used a Max Potion while Golbat used Wing Attack again.  After another Wing Attack to yellow, I just had AnthrWirld take it out with Ice Punch.  Aaand, of course Kadabra was next!  I actually had Jungle Hunt jump in to set up Sleep Powder after it set up Future Sight, but it woke up right after I swapped to Bug!.  

It only tried to set up Future Sight again, so Bug! was okay to hit it with Take Down to yellow health before the Future Sight took him to yellow health as well.  Kadabra set up Future Sight again right away, but Take Down KO’d.  Unfortunately, that meant we were two turns away from Future Sight, and Typhlosion was coming out next...  

I decided to not have Bug! do what Pineco do best and shifted to AnthrWirld, healing her right away... Only for Typhlosion to bring up the Kingdra trauma and blind her with Smoke, ugh.  Typhlosion did a bit of damage with Flame Wheel next, and Surf brought it to red.  So here comes Future Sight...  It failed?  Huh??  Well, guess that's 90% accuracy for ya.  

Typhlosion tried to set up more Smoke, but AnthrWirld washed it away.  VIII-BitNG faced off with Magneton next, setting up Leer for a big hit with Rock Smash.  He dodged the first Thunder Wave, but got hit by the second.  Magneton didn’t have anything stronger than ThunderShock though, so VIII-BitNG was okay to take it out with another Rock Smash.  

That left Haunter for last, so Lode Runner shifted in to take it out with two Confusions.  Haunter didn’t do anything of worth, wasting his only turn on making Lode Runner eat her “Persim”.

Yeah, that’s fair [for a final Rival battle.](https://i.imgur.com/oQs1h60.png)  I’m glad I didn’t have to resort to SelfDestruct!  >!Fun(?) Fact: I created two trainer IDs with different Pineco sprites, one for Bug! being happy and alive, and one for him being grumpy and dead.!<

___  
**Where I left off**  
I did quite a lot last time: kicked Team Rocket out of Mahogany, got Eusine started on the Suicune Hunt, and earned the Storm and Glacier Badges.  Most of the battles shared something in common though: I kept putting Pokemon in danger!  (Sorry, guys...)  [Team: Canimals/Weepinbell (27), Popeye/Poliwrath (31), 8-Bit Ninja Gaiden/Heracross (27), Ice Climber/Pinsir (27), MUSCLE “Metroid”/Machop (27), and Plok!/Machop (27).](https://i.imgur.com/gkULtOg.png)  
___  
**VS Jasmine**  
The team is actually staying the same for Jasmine, but here’s the items and upgraded levels as usual: Popeye (35+Gold Berry), Canimals (30+Miracle Seed), VIII-BitNG (30+”Cheri”), Ice Climber (30+BlackBelt), MUSCLE “Metroid”/Machoke (30+Quick Claw), and Plok!/Machoke (30+Gold Berry).  (BTW, Canimals+Ice Climber got [Pokerus while training?!?](https://i.imgur.com/NlRV2ON.png)  Only Ice Climber and the Machops were under the level limit then, so they got some Attack DV training in.)  

Plok! led us off and managed to take out both of the Magnemites in the same amount of Karate Chops, nice!  Sadly, he wasn’t so well off against Steelix: Karate Chop didn’t do much and Iron Tail landed.  Plok! got knocked to yellow HP, where he ate his Gold Berry before I pulled him out for Popeye.  

Iron Tail did much less to Popeye on the swap-in turn, so I felt okay to put Steelix to sleep to avoid Sunny Day.  (Well, Popeye has Rain Dance, so it didn’t really matter.)  One Surf wound up critting the Steelix and taking it out!  

Whoa, nice job [making up for the Murkrow trouble last time, Plok!](https://i.imgur.com/KPX49yK.png)  Too bad that Iron Tail stopped you in your tracks.  
___  
**Radio coup**  
Of course, that’s the last of the Gym Leader Trio, so Elm called about the Radio Tower announcement, which will be the rest of the update!  Popeye is too high-leveled for all of the Radio Tower caps except for “Archer”, so the third place Poliwag, ShdwComplx, came with.  I miss the first place Poliwag, but she’ll be back after this Rocket Intermission!  

...Then I forgot to turn towards Goldenrod and went straight to... Rt. 44!?  I knew you could go to Blackthorn before completing the tower, because someone blocks the gym, but I thought it was after dealing with the False Director!  Well, I wasn’t going to make this update longer by taking that whole detour, but at least grabbed Ratchet & Clank/Tangela (RatchClank in-game) in the isolated grass there.  So there was an encounter this time after all, heh!  
___  
**VS “Petrel”**  
Ehh, Lode Runner/Venomoth is a better choice than ShdwComplx for this fight, but she’ll be back in a bit.  Team: Lode Runner (32+Gold Berry), Canimals (30+Miracle Seed), VIII-BitNG (30+”Pecha”), Ice Climber (30+Gold Berry), MUSCLE “Metroid” (30+Quick Claw), and Plok! (30+”Pecha”).  We might need Ice Climber’s high defense here...  

Lode Runner dodged a Smokescreen from Koffing #1 so she could take it out in two Confusion attacks, but Koffing #2’s smoke wound up landing.  Lode Runner still managed to Crit-OHKO it, though!  VIII-BitNG came in for Koffing #3 so Lode Runner could wipe her eyes.  After setting up a Leer and dodging some smoke, VIII-BitNG knocked it to yellow with a Horn Attack before finally running into smoke.  He managed to finish off the Koffing with another Horn Attack, though.  

I had Ice Climber and her 77 Defense face Weezing.  She took two SmokeScreens to her eyes, but kept hitting with ViceGrip until Weezing was in low yellow health...  Yeah, that was [a bad idea!](https://i.imgur.com/pNzA31c.png)  The halved Defense mechanic is *so* infuriating!!  And Ice Climber was doing **such** great work, too!  

VIII-BitNG returned for Koffing #4.  He took two SmokeScreens, but his Horn Attack 3KO’d with no misses.  (Pinsir and Heracross have some lore about being rivals, so I imagined VIII-Bit as being angry that his rival got taken out as he fought the smoke in his eyes.)  Lode Runner returned for the final Koffing, stunning it and taking a smoke to the face before OHKO-ing it outright with another Crit Confusion, a repeat of Koffing #2!  

Yeah, I knew not having a Rock- or Steel-type would suck for this battle.  I think my unfortunate choice of taking a break before facing “Petrel” made me forget that Canimals was there to put some bombs to sleep, though, ugh.  
___  
**VS Rival Owliver**  
Alright, time to diversify the team again... because I forgot Owliver’s lowest is 28.  I wound up pulling out some unused ‘mons this time, so here’s the Team: ShdwComplx/Poliwhirl (32+Gold Berry), Bud Redhed/Skiploom (28+”Persim”), Hello Kitty/Butterfree (28+Quick Claw), Wonder Boy/Hitmontop (28+BlackBelt), Knytt/Ledian (28+Gold Berry), and N/Heracross (28+”Cheri”).  N and Wonder Boy, don’t let me down with your 0 Attack DVs... (Well, N’s max Defense DVs look nice.)  

ShdwComplx faced off with the Wing Attack-having Golbat first, but she missed Hypnosis and got confused into hurting herself into Gold Berry-eating range, ugh.  I sprayed her with a Full Restore and Golbat’s Wing Attack did less, so I used Hypnosis... and it landed!  Three Surfs took Golbat out in its sleep.  (As expected for 3rd Place.)  

Wonder Boy came out for Magnemite, and he crit it to yellow right away, whoa!  He got paralyzed in return, but after a weak SonicBoom Wonder Boy fought through and finished Magnemite off with Rock Smash!  Next was Haunter, Hello Kitty’s prey.  She landed SleepPowder, but not before Curse landed, augh.  Unfortunately, Confusion didn’t take it right out and Curse took her to about half health.  But I guess Curse doesn’t do damage when the Curse User is dead, because Hello Kitty wasn’t hurt after she KO’d Haunter the next turn.  

ShdwComplx returned for Quilava, taking it to red with one Surf before Quilava landed a SmokeScreen, augh.  Instead of the usual wave, the blinded ShdwComplx flooded the battlefield with a wider and weaker Surf to take out the well-damaged Quilava.  (Or at least that’s what would happen in the anime, heh!)  

Which left Sneasel vs N for last.  Sneasel used Leer right off the bat before surviving a Rock Smash in the red.  Even with that Leer, N’s big Defense made Sneasel’s Quick Attack bounce right off her!  That just left N to KO with one more Rock Smash.  

The 0 Attack DV gang did a really good job, whoa!  And Knytt took out the nearby Gloom Grunt with Ice Punch, so withdrawing her didn’t go to waste either.  
___  
**VS “Proton”**  
It’s time for Hello Kitty’s last stand! (Maybe.)  1v1 with a lv. 36 Golbat, still holding the Quick Claw...  

...Of course Golbat went first with Wing Attack and took her to 43/104 HP, augh!  SleepPowder landed regardless, though.  She had just learned Psybeam, but it still took two of them to take out the sleepy bat.  

Yeesh, that was a close one!  It might’ve been a good idea to bring someone as back-up, but Hello Kitty eked it out!  
___  
**VS “Ariana""**  
Team: Lode Runner (32+Gold Berry), Canimals (31+Miracle Seed), MUSCLE “Metroid” (31+Quick Claw), Knytt (31+”Chesto”), and Plok! (31+Gold Berry).  

Lode Runner’s Stun Spore stunned Arbok into not moving right away, and a Confusion attack made that Parafusion right away, nice!  Arbok missed Glare that turn, so Lode Runner was OK to attack again.  Lode Runner just barely didn’t KO, but Arbok took itself out thanks to the Confusion!  

Next was the Murkrow that scared Plok! last update.  Peck did less damage to him this time, somewhere in 3KO range.  ThunderPunch took Murkrow to yellow health this time, so Plok! stayed in and took a Peck to 33/98 HP so he could take his revenge with one final ThunderPunch!  

Knytt was here for Vileplume, setting up Light Screen before taking it to yellow with an Ice Punch.  Acid did about 20 damage after that, so I’m sure Light Screen helped a lot!  I expected a KO next turn, but Vileplume survived on a sliver and almost knocked Knytt to yellow health with another Acid!  One more Ice Punch took it out, though.  

Oh right, Adv.Island/Ledyba was the better Ledyba line ‘mon, not Knytt. (All his DVs, sans HP and Defense, are double-digit.)  That sliver wouldn't have happened if I had pulled out Adv.Island.  
___  
**VS “Archer""**  
Team: Popeye (35+Gold Berry), ShdwComplx (33+BlackBelt), Lode Runner (33+Gold Berry), Wonder Boy (33+”Pecha”), MUSCLE “Metroid” (33+Quick Claw), and Plok! (33+”Pecha”).  I’ll probably only use half of this team, but better safe than sorry!

ShdwComplx easily Surfed away Houndour.  Next was Koffing, so Lode Runner came out.  She got hit with a Smokescreen once again, but she finished off Koffing with two Confusion attacks and no misses.  (Man, Smoke isn’t much of a problem here, huh?)  Popeye faced the Houndoom and got poisoned by Smog, but that didn’t stop his Surf from washing it away.

Yeah, I guess I didn’t need to bring the Fighting-type back-ups after all.  Once “Archer” cleared out, the Director came to give me the Clear Bell, but it doesn’t seem like fighting Suicune is mandatory, so I probably won’t.  I also grabbed the Pink Bow and Sunny Day TM on the way down, but I don’t think that final one will get used either thanks to all my Grass-types that don’t have Sun-based abilities yet.  

Anyway, see you next time for Ice Path and beyond! 👋

The Fall of Vale and its Uprising (from my Halo crossover),RWBYOC,1fief89,2024-09-16 16:04:46,3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYOC/comments/1fief89/the_fall_of_vale_and_its_uprising_from_my_halo/,danielpNB65,Fanfic,"When the Covenant attacked during the Fall of Beacon, chaos reigned. While various Huntsmen coordinated with the newly-arrived UNSC Marines and ODSTs to evacuate civilians from Vale, the White Fang, who’d been attacking Beacon, scattered and slipped away into the sewer system. While fleeing Beacon, Adam Taurus faced down an Elite, losing his sword and an arm. Thanks to the Vale Chapter Master, Shane Masser, Adam’s life was spared and the two escaped into the now-burning city.

In the immediate aftermath of the battle, the people who didn’t evacuate, flee into the sewers or otherwise conceal themselves were hunted down and exterminated by the Covenant. While in the sewer system, Adam met an Atlesian bionics smith, who made him a mechanical arm. Adam then withdrew into a few days of contemplation. He decided that it was better to align with humanity than let the aliens destroy the planet. So he ordered his people to begin training the refugees to fight, and sent Shane Masser’s Team SHDW out to both make contact with the outside world and to gather up more refugees and escort them into the sewers.

Wayne of Team SHDW successfully contacted Marines outside Vale, who put him in touch with Damascus Armories to arrange for the smuggling of weapons, ammo and food into the city. Now with a steady supply of necessities, the people of Vale began to rally. Those who didn’t wish to fight or were unable were safely led to either Mountain Glenn to be evacuated to Mantle, or to safety on Patch. Adam slowly became an icon of hope and freedom to the people.

Finally, a year and a half into the overall invasion, Vale was primed for revolt. The Covenant warships over the city had been drawn away to conflict elsewhere, leaving behind a small garrison to maintain control. With Damascus-forged sword in hand, Adam started the Vale Uprising. The people poured out of the sewers, armed with the latest weapons from Damascus, and attacked the garrison. They swarmed the base established in the city center, with Adam at the head, flanked by the Shadows. Adam broke into the base and engaged the General left in charge, taking him down. Adam walked out of the base with the Elite’s head in hand to the cheers of the army he’d raised.

After the Uprising, the White Fang were hailed as heroes and given a place within the Remnant Defense Force as a Special Operations Unit. A statue was raised in the center of Vale in Adam’s honor. Weiss Schnee even paid to have Adam’s brand surgically removed. In addition, Adam met a young UNSC Lieutenant named Amanda, who’d been sent to help oversee the training before the Uprising. The two fell in love and, after the war, had a daughter named Eve."

**Where I left off**  
After a battle with Elder Li that dragged out for tens of turns, Falkner’s battle was a lot easier than expected.  Credit goes to Whirl-d’s incredibly accurate Hypnosis for that defeat.  [Team: RoboCop/Chikorita (11), Bud Redhed/Hoppip (10), Another Whirl-d/Poliwag (10), Hello Kitty/Butterfree (10), and Canimals/Bellsprout (10).](https://i.imgur.com/e5yNYrU.png)  
___  
**Golden threat**  
Just like last time, the Togepi Egg goes in a special Box named Jail.  That’ll make it think twice about being a Flying-type!  I honestly don’t think I’m going to be able to use Togetic in any of these runs, which just sounds like a silly Pokemon to ban, heh.  (At least it wasn’t Froslass!)  

The next stop was Rt. 32, which I wanted to save for a Headbutt encounter next update to help me get a chance at Heracross on Rt. 33 or Azalea City. (So they also get saved.)  Of course, Rt. 32 has a lot of mandatory grass to walk through (and Repels aren’t sold in Violet!), but Giana got swarmed by Wooper, so it was okay.  

The free Miracle Seed went to Canimals so she could tear up the Fisherman with Vine Whip.  Though I quickly got a reminder that not *all* of the Fishermen were free when one pulled out [a Goldeen with Peck, ack!](https://i.imgur.com/ugy3tFp.png)  I rushed to the Pokemon Center after that and got ambushed by the Wooper Trainer without changing the lead... but Canimals quickly OHKO’d the lv. 10 Wooper while suffering at 4 HP, whoa!  

After I got to the Center and healed, I picked up the Old Rod so I could fish up some Poliwag in Violet City and Ruins of Alph.  They got named Shadow Complex (ShdwComplx)... and Popeye. What a perfect name for a Poliwrath!  Popeye actually wound up being the better of the two, (I wonder why all three have the same # of SpAt and SpDef DVs...?  DV spreads are weird, heh.) so he joined as the sixth for now.  

I let him go ham (spinach?) in the ornithophobe-free Union Cave, and he wound up learning Water Gun before AnthrWirld, so she got jealous, heh.  That does make 5 tokens total, but that rule only applies to Chikorita this leg and I’ll be protecting RoboCop with my life!  

Not long later, I arrived at Ilex Forest, which has some very cool ornithophobic Pokemon.  I headed in at night to raise my chances of Oddish and Venonat and caught LodeRunner/Venonat, but it turns out Ilex Forest is the only place to catch an Oddish in Johto, so I might come back here later to use 3 tokens.  LodeRunner has better SpAt IVs than Hello Kitty, but she doesn’t learn Confusion until lv. 17, so she gets to sit on the back burner as I advance the story and get Token #6 from Slowpoke Well.  
___  
**VS “Proton”**  
He only has one Pokemon, so I’m only going to use Hello Kitty (12) versus his Koffing (14)...  

Hello Kitty needed three Confusion attacks this time, but Koffing only used a weak Tackle and missed Smog, so she was fine.  The reason I didn’t have her match Koffing’s level is so she could be used in the rival fight, and thankfully she didn’t manage to level, so she joins!  
___  
**VS Rival Owliver**  
Team: AnthrWirld (16), Hello Kitty (12+”Cheri”), and ShdwComplx (12).  Water Gun is a lv. 13 move, so Popeye couldn’t join.  

Hello Kitty started us off by taking out Gastly with another 1-2 Confusion attack.  The Gastly did use Lick both times, but didn’t get the paralysis, heh.  She leveled up after that and learned PoisonPowder, which could be useful, hmmm.  

Owliver went straight for Quilava, so I threw out ShdwComplx.  Unfortunately, he refuted her Hypnosis by going first with Smokescreen, then crit her down to yellow with a Tackle.  So AnthrWirld swapped in instead, the next Tackle bouncing off of her.  Without smoke in her eyes, she landed Hypnosis right away and lobbed Water at Quilava for three turns to knock it out.  

As for Zubat, Hello Kitty finally landed a confusion status, having the bat hit himself before the second Confusion attack took it out.  

Yeah, I *knew* I didn’t need a whole six ‘mons for this.  After a side track to get the Cut HM, it’s time to face Bugsy.  
___  
**VS Bugsy**  
Team: AnthrWirld (16+Berry), RoboCop (14+Berry), Hello Kitty (14+”Pecha”), Canimals (14+Miracle Seed), and LodeRunner (14).  

RoboCop took Metapod out with a lot of Razor Leaf while the cocoon’s Tackles did very little.  Well, Razor Leaf is resisted, so it took 5, but Metapod only took RoboCop down to 32/41 in the same number of turns, heh.  

Kakuna got a taste of Hello Kitty’s 1-2 Confusion attack, then AnthrWirld came out to face the next intimidating Ace, Scyther.  After a Leer, her Hypnosis landed!  Water Gun didn’t do a lot, but since Scyther was asleep for a full five turns, AnthrWirld got it down to yellow HP on that wake up turn, but it had started Fury Cutter... Only to use Quick Attack next turn, which hit AnthrWirld to 15/44 HP, ack!  

Her Water Gun that turn brought Scyther to a sliver of HP though, and she gobbled up her Berry to regain 10HP.  Once again, I probably should’ve swapped, but I clicked Water Gun... and Quick Attack took her right to 5HP, aaa!  Water Gun still KO’d, though.  

Oh my god, that was [*really* close, Another Whirl-d!](https://i.imgur.com/CN3rHEa.png)  I’m so stubborn when I see that the enemy Pokemon is so close to death, ugh.  Well, at least the expectation was met for Bugsy’s Scyther (and Metapod) being annoying.

$NOS vs $SHDW long term depin positioning,solana,1b4xviu,2024-03-02 15:29:12,13,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1b4xviu/nos_vs_shdw_long_term_depin_positioning/,ghostoutfits,Ecosystem,"Got excited about two Solana ecosystem projects recently:
- Nosana ($NOS) is decentralized compute power, a partner to $RNDR, market cap $450M ([#179 on Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nosana))

- Shadow ($SHDW) Genesys Go is decentralized storage with marketcap $170M ([#348 in Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/genesysgo-shadow), competitor to Filecoin ($FLC).

$NOS has gone 4x in the past few weeks, likely because the partnership with RNDR is new, and a larger depin AI wave. But RNDR has been flat or negatively in a similar time period. What’s the best explanation?

A - Folks are riding an enthusiasm for projects in the “news”, and the partnership did this for $NOS. Just wait until the same catches on for $SHDW.

B - Cloud storage is cheap and ubiquitous compared to processing… therefore the application for $NOS is more profitable and compelling long term while SHDW will struggle to gain traction.

C - It’s animal spirits all the way down. Don’t try to reason through it, just buy your crypto lotto ticket and hold on.

Anybody have a bull and bear thesis on these? I am considering swapping some $SOL for $SHDW, $NOS and $BONK as leverage plays since $SOL has pumped hard and arguably only has a 5x from here. 

Also considering to swap $JTO/$PYTH for $MNADE because the market caps appear to be overvalued and undervalued respectively. Marinade Finance has more TVL than Jito.

***Notes on the Species of the Galaxy***

_Written by u/TheSmogmonsterZX_

As my time in the 217 Species Alliance begins, I am making notes on the species for our people to use in regard to later interactions.  

**Civeet**

Cradle World: Cith

Home System: Kiu

The Civeet stand roughly 91.5 cm on average with a weight of around 30kg on average.  They have coats of dense fur that coats their bodies and skulls not dissimilar from Earth’s Opossum’s.  They have a variety of fur patterns often dictated by their environment and generations of adaptations that occur.  Civeet are obligate carnivores that occasionally add some vegetation to their diet. Due to their planet’s moons causing fluctuating gravity, they need to keep their bodies heavily fortified with proteins to strengthen their muscles every few months.

Civeet civilization has many facets and social dynamics, like all spacefaring worlds, however their primary public facing features are their engineering corps.  Civeet are naturally drawn to such endeavors as they primarily lived underground until shortly before they developed space flight.  Their engineers are considered second to none and have much to teach Humanity.  They also have little patience for political machinations, though are quite capable of playing the game within such a job.

**Phodia**

Cradle World: Phaidu

Home System: Yiandi

The Phodia are a physically odd species.  A cross between a turtle, seal and an otter, they are quadrupedal with a hard carapace for a shell and strong legs despite being from a mostly low gravity world.  They have no scales on their body but have soft fur that runs the majority of their upper body.  The upper body has hands made for manual dexterity and are capable of completing many tasks a human’s hands would.  Their faces have otter-like eyes, Seal like facial structures and teeth meant to grind down the harshest of barks, plants and roots. Phodia are strict herbivores, mostly owing to biology, but also their very pervasive philosophy within their species.

The most obvious concern about Phodia is “The switch”.  Phodia are capable of twisting their spine 180 degrees to re-align themselves to a rear facing posture.  This allows them to use their shells as makeshift tables, or in drastic need, use their shell as a violent and heavy battering ram.  This combined with the average height of 182 cm and weight of 204 kg (at Earth gravity) means that when they hit, they hit hard and with a centered mass.  Considered dangerous if angered.

Phodia have a monoculture, a frightening aspect, but the Phodia are all bound by the desire to help the herd and they tend to define the herd as anything remotely friendly.  This monoculture has led to multiple strengths and weaknesses.  First, they have a decidedly united purpose in war as shown by their victory over the technologically superior Fo-oi.  Second, they have a unity of purpose that we as humans should be envious of.  Third, they help each other regardless of offered or expected rewards.  The greatest weakness is a pervasive naivete the young generations tend to have, which for a species that can live over two centuries is a concern.  

**Sendakin**

Cradle World: Sendasin

Home System: Sendo

The Sendakin are what we would call “The Greys”.  The Sendakin vehemently state they have never visited Earth and are decidedly disturbed by our stories of The Greys.  Their ambassador has shared that centuries ago a rogue Intelligence Service did leave their space and had offered that as a possible explanation.  Ambassador Frenna Dolwaa has also offered to review any surviving evidence to check for possible truths as abductions and experimentation violate the species most primary spiritual beliefs, not to mention the Alliance’s most important laws.

Sendakin are roughly 167 cm tall on average and 36 kg, making them slender and with low musculature.  This is not a surprise given that they are from one of the lowest gravity worlds in the Alliance.  Most Sendakin require muscle implants and growth stimulation to even work outside of their colonies, let alone on the Galactic Social Dynamic.

Sendakin cultures are vast, numbered and intriguing in as many ways as our own on Earth.  The Ambassador is from a northern culture that values truth of word and unified actions being confirmed before proceeding, she calls it “Galtash” and roughly translates to “Truth Walkers”.  Their front-facing culture we see the majority of the time, is actually their more adventurous and curious younger generations as older Sendakin tend to retreat back to the comfort of their low gravity colonies and home world.  A shame to be sure, they are a very open species from what has been observed.

**Fo-oi**

Cradle World: Fo

Home System: Fo

The Fo-oi are a mystery wrapped in an enigma, possibly all as a joke.  We know little about their physical form.  Only that they spend their time off their planets in “Exposure suits”' to protect from some unknown aspect of life off of their worlds, which no one has figured out.  What we do know is they have six digits with two opposable thumbs on each hand.  They are physically impressive in regards to their strength though it is unknown if that is a physical trait of their bodies or their suits.

Ambassador-Legate Commistence is the only real source of culture we have at this time besides his soldiers and aides.  He is a force of personality and juxtaposition as he can be a booming source of sound one minute and a calm source of logic the next.  We do know the people as a general rule enjoy learning and take every opportunity to learn what they can about others.

Hopes of learning more about their physical forms are low as their diplomats as a rule have a Do not Resuscitate Order on themselves and their aides and soldiers.  This extends to the mechanics of their suits which apparently combust in something called “Black Ichor”, which is apparently something that burns hotter than white phosphorus but only burns organic material.

_As a note: Ambassador-Legate Commistence has met “The Immortal” and his only response was.  “Problematic” and “Impressive.”  The immortal and myself have noted this as concerning._

**Uoplo**

Cradle Worldt: Dalni

Home System: Isih

The Uoplo are an intriguing people.  Their heights and weights can range even more sporadically than our own as does their personalities.  They have a bevy of many interesting cultures, but you would not know that if you met them in the greater galaxy as their front facing facet is their military which is a heavy monoculture of discipline and order.  This is due to a very dangerous amount of deadly flora from their homeworld that requires such discipline and fearlessness to survive.  

That being said we must consider the Uoplo as potential danger once the war is over.  Multiple instances of espionage have been attempted by the species and we have proof that the Ambassador Rilllke has been involved in at least one.  Currently this information is being contained so as to avoid a diplomatic incident but has been logged with both The Captain of the Galactic Social Dynamic and Chief of Security Ga-sh Droll.  I have suspended most talks with Rillke and other Uoplo in the meantime until I can review older security logs to make sure such meetings are secure.

_Update: Rillke's sudden loss of his home colony has changed a great deal of his world views.  Rillke is fast becoming a strong ally, but his people are now more resistant to us for some reason._

_Secondary Update: As of the marriage of Ambassador Brunte and Rillke, Earth United is watching the Uoplo people with keen interest. Their reactions may spell their own doom, or a possible friendly future. Time will tell   --- Admiral Zandissi._

**Turyaj**

Cradle world: Roham

Home System: Reh

The Turyaj are pleasant people when you meet them in space, but I am told the majority of their race prefers to live on their mostly tropical worlds that they have painstakingly terraformed into single biome worlds over thousands of years.  The people are not a monoculture exactly, but each of their colonies tends to develop into a miniature monoculture of its own.  This does help keep their species culture diverse as the species loves to travel amongst their own kind quite a bit.  They do tend to have a slight xenophobic streak but are not apt towards violence in regards to their responses.

Physically Turyaj resemble a large orangutan with various colored stripes and the thick arms of a gorilla, they have long legs and the combined features are striking to the mythological ""Sasquatch"" of Earth.  It should be noted that the coat colors tend to reflect familial lineage and clan association and can be ""read"" by other Turyaj like a name.  Despite their seemingly incredible size their home world's low gravity means they are barely stronger than a human.

Their cultures tend to be clan based with the various clans having specializations in their various aspects of farming, engineering and other required needs of civilization.  Space travel clans are relatively recent for the species only having been around for about 700 years.  Space travel clans tend to have a solid black coat with red or yellow stripes.

**Jolm**

Cradle world: Jolad

Home system: Polit

The Jolm are a hive species without a hive mind.  That is to say they are like bees in that they are individuals all focused on the survival of the hive.  The Jolm appear to us as large crickets or grasshoppers with vertical mouths.  They are mostly herbivorous but can consume meat when required for survival.

The Jolm live two to three times the length of a human on average with down of their biological castes having even longer lifespans.

**Grrt**

Cradle World: Tahk

Home System: Yuol

Grrt evolved from avian predators. Their people tend to reflect this as passionate pursuers of their chosen professions and hobbies. I have not yet yet once met a Grrt that couldn’t go into an hours long detailed lesson on their passions.

Grrt physically, stand roughly 150 to 180 cm tall on average with a heavy body weight as their ancestors eventually became ground hunters as they developed tools and new ways to hunt. Grrt cannot glide as they have developed true fingers that can grasp and hold tools. They have three on each hand with a thumb. Each finger also had a sharp claw on its end that most Grrt put a cap on while in public.

**Bodivayne**

Cradle World: Tannisk

Home System: Arish

Bodivayne are another “centaurian” race. They are covered in fur and resemble six legged bears, their front most paws are used as hand in modern times, but can be used to help the run even faster. Bodivayne as a rule tends to split into two camps, Worker and Leader. Workers tend to seclude themselves away from non-bodivaynes and display xenophobic tendencies, while leaders like Security Officer G’garbold and Bridge Officer Shent embrace learning in all facets and work well with other species. Leader Bodivayne tend to lean towards the general integrated Alliance culture politically and favor simple, direct solutions.

**Iuno**

Cradle World: Uno (U-know)

Home System: Yugoi

One of the oldest running species in the Alliance. They faced unparalleled food shortages during First Contact and the Alliance assisted them the entire time. As a result the Iuno are nearly fanatically loyal to the Alliance, but are always seeking outside opinions and views to better make the system work for the people.

Iuno resembles a cross between a pelican and a shoebill from Earth. Their wings, however, have evolved into long delicate fingers that they use for manual dexterity. They can still glide and derive great pleasure from doing so, but can no longer fly without mechanical assistance. Iuno cultures are almost a monoculture, but just barely hold onto their individual ideals and philosophies. They make up the majority of the Alliance culture.

**Glosht**

Cradle World: Oshii (The Green Way)

Home System: Taxxix

One of the founding races of the Alliance, the Glosht are unusual, to say the least. Once they were large arachnoid-like fungal creatures that would terrify any pirate that dare oppose them.  Despite their appearance though, Glosht are nothing but kind and considerate hosts and diplomats. And though they still possess a towering frame, their species has lost the use of their legs due to overdependence on their anti-gravity chairs to move around. They do not consume food for energy, but gasses. They are also unable to colonize outside of their world as their way of reproduction is tied to their Cradle World, which according to all documentation is its own life form.

_Update: Due to their own concerns about the war the Glosht have entered a stage of rapid growth and evolution, recalling all but a few of their people back to their Cradle World. Since this even started their cities have gone dark and have been covered in a hard black resin. Earth United and many other governments are standing vigil over the world in its defense during this time. --- Admiral Zandissi._

**Shriol**

Cradle World: Srrii

Home System: Yoo

One of the only other surviving members of the Founding Races, the Shriol are only known to us currently through documentation.  They are roughly 60 to 70 cm tall and have two long prehensile tails they use for manual dexterity.  They are bipedal but lack normal arms, having swimming appendages in their place. They breathe through their skin and are amphibious.  

Currently they are suffering a plague that is capable of quickly jumping the species barriers. Earth United has sent Intelligence Assistance to aid in their care and recovery.

_Update: Some Intelligence calling himself “Eureka da Bomb” claims to have found a treatment. We are looking into this --- Emma Brunte._

**Dynasid**

Cradle World: Buak

Home System: Buak-ol

Long bodied with 3 sets of dual purpose limbs the Dynasid are large, most go over 3 meters in length and are serpentine. Heavily carnivorous and covered in scales and feathers that seem to shimmer and gleam, the species has a love for showing off their hunting skills, spirituality and their scales and feathers.  Most of their culture is unknown, but apparently human media has become a hit on their world, very specifically The Muppets.

**Sulash**

Cradle World: Cassat

Home System: Yurok

Another serpentine species, slightly shorter than the previous at about 2 meters long. They possess two arms and an additional set of grasping limbs that were once used to hold their people to trees as they hunted or scouted. They have four eyes, two focused forward and two to the side to check for predators. They also possess a refined “Paranoia” about new environments and people and tend to pick up things other species would miss. They have recurved and serrated teeth in their long crocodilian maws and are constrictors by nature.

**NSAD**

Cradle World: -No Name Given-, 566-Jα-II

Home System: Labeled System 566-Jα

A species so bizarre that every other species has them labeled as  “Non Standard Alien Design” in part because they have no name for themselves.  They appear to be floating puffs of spores but reproduce sexually and are of a hive-mind that simply wants to make friends.  Being around one for an extended period of time relieves stress.  Somehow.

As a note the species has no name for their own world or home system, accepting any label outsiders give it.  We have translated the Alliance label for their Home System and Cradle World

***A note, the following races are ones that no human has currently encountered. All information is second hand or gathered through historical documents from the Alliance.***
 
**Freninkk**

Cradle World: Hinnin

Home System: Nin

 Aquatic Reptilians that require suits to be out of the water.  Rarely seen due to the needs required to house them on a normal Alliance ship.  The Freninkk happily provide a seemingly endless supply of various fish to all species in the alliance.

**Basstji**

Cradle World: Yuuli

Home System: Itike

Basstji are Insectoid Wood Harvesters and prefer to stay on their worlds and provide commerce. Images show they resemble large pill bugs or roly-polys of Earth.  Despite this they are rarely over a meter tall and enjoy interacting with new species.  We have already initiated some trade with them for colonial supply lines, their prices are fair and sometimes self-depreciating.

**Teehop**

Cradle World: Visseti

Home System: Seeti

Teehop are large Bodied mammals with strong limbs.  Covered in fur with small eyes and great hearing.  Speak slowly in anything outside of their native language which is spoken incredibly fast.  Their home world and colonies have a midrange of gravity and they are agricultural masters who apparently do not believe in the concept of “honor” or “Rules of War”.

**Vanddrila**

Cradle World: Kass’klk’cul’dur

Home System: Kass

The Vanddrila are a symbiotic species that dwell inside a mobile plant species on their world. Normally this plant is blind and incapable of detecting anything and the Vanddrila lack the ability to move at any significant rate or metabolize all the nutrients they need to survive. But when the two species bond, a process that is permanent, the plant can detect others of its kind to reproduce and move without falling into a pit. The Vanddrila in turn can better process its nutrients and actually move.
The only distressing thing of note is that the Vanddrila are essentially a long bodied centipede-like creature that lives in a bod inside their mobile plant partners they call “Hu’hchul”. Images of them are actually comparable to pharyngeal jaws of an eel or even the fictional jaws of the “Xenomorph”. They do seem to be aware of the discomfort they cause other life and tend to hide inside their plant partners.

**Tak-ka**

Cradle World: Foeth

Home System: Hael

Tak-ka resemble eel-like aliens with arm-like fins.  Currently they only reside on their worlds and ships due to requirements to house them. They have perfect eyesight both in and out of water.  Can be out of water temporarily but cannot move when out of water.

**Jrtp**

Cradle World: Hal

Home System: Bak-KalI

A reclusive insectoid species, they run endless mines on their colonies.  Appear to us as giant Centipedes and have large pedipalps that they use as arms.  Very loyal but know they upset others and use holographic interfaces to speak to others outside their species.

**Tahough**

Cradle World: Kishah

System World: Vashah

Tahough are a squat silicone based life form that are able to grow moss on their faces, almost like a beard in humans. The species prefers to mostly keep to themselves, but will gladly help the Alliance when called upon. They are master miners and melee combatants. Some have taken to calling them “Space Dwarves”, an oddity considering their Cradle world’s name Translates to “Stone”.

**Fouesdg**

Cradle World: Tuss

System World: Go

Tall mammals with eyes on stalks.  Resemble space otters to a degree.  Love to use loopholes. We don’t have much information on them. They stay in their colonies and prefer not to get involved with Galactic Stage Politics.

**Shamay**

Cradle World: Dine’esh

Home System: Hik’scal

A species of soft spoken and rarely seen pacifists. Their colonies are usually only visited for medical treatments and vacations. Though not isolationists they prefer their privacy.

**Dosmann**

Cradle World: Olllo

Home System: Fi’kl

Dosmann are heavily built silicone based reptilians meant to survive on worlds with heavy gravity and molten surfaces. They are terravores who seek mostly uninhabited worlds to spread to.

Cradle World: Kii

Home System: Oot

Primates that live in peace on their worlds.  They appear to be in decline due to the age of their species.  Will still fight till the end.  Wield powerful melee weapons laced with “energy blades”. They appear as tall and athletic Rhesus monkeys dressed more often in robes than anything else. They claim to have once held powerful mental abilities.  

**Inthoi**

Cradle World: G’lk’ak

Home System: Fr’a’rel’ma

Tall monocular beings with the strange capacity to change how they see the world. They have gray mottled skin, almost like scales and six fingered hands that are often capped with metal tabs for religious purposes. They can see infrared, ultraviolet, ROYGBIV, TCV and Sonic pulse.  Intelligent to a fault they perform many mathematical jobs from their colonies and will often hire themselves out for such purposes on the colonies of species they are familiar with.

Home System: N/A

Deep space explorers that abandoned their colonies for massive colony ships.  The mostly stay in communication with the Alliance.  1 small colony remains to help maintain the Alliance HQ.

The colony is maintained by the Alliance and is not their Cradle System, which they have abandoned and the Alliance has quarantined at their request.

**Talshid**

Cradle World: Poll’g

Home System: Heck’in

A species of midnight black canids that hunt exclusively in the dark.  They have four sets of legs and no arms.  They do not use tool manipulation, leaving those things with the species known as “Talgids” which they developed with on their home world.  They are preeminent hunters and trackers but horribly allergic to UV light. They have excellent vision and hearing and are trusted bounty hunters in the Alliance.

**Talgids**

Cradle World: Poll’g

Home System: Heck’in

Small furry primates with large manes of brightly colored fur.  Omnivorous and clever they developed alongside the Talshid, providing tool manipulation and aid in hunts for the help of finding prey. They are near sighted as a species, but are on equal standing with the Talshid and often express concern for their more aggressive partner species.

**Casck**

Cradle World: Osak

Home System: Shraay

A formerly dominating power now in decline due to over manipulating their own genetic code.  Large framed crustaceans that once held half the space of the Alliance and  can now barely hold their own territory. They are struggling to stop the deterioration of their own genetic code and are unable to participate in the political environment outside of votes. Earth United has sent a Medical Corps to assist in their attempts to save themselves.

**Yees**

Cradle World: Ruu’taai

HomeSystem: J’dai

 Avians that leave little trace of their existence on any world they colonize, living in shelters they grow from genetically modified trees.

Their home system is said to have the largest unspoiled forest in the Alliance.


**Icsal**

Cradle World: Crallick

Home System: Kaop

Rarely seen species that has followed a monoculture of holy servitude and taken specific vows not to interfere with the outside worlds.  Leaves their colonies open to those that need them. Their visage has been lost behind the masks of pure white or black that they wear. They dedicate themselves to beings they call The “Inheritors”.

_Ambassador Emma Brunte has requested more detailed information about this species._

_AAO Is reviewing this request._  

**Ush**

Cradle World: Yarth

Home System: Sil

Small furred reptiles with a desire to test explosives seemingly everywhere.  Love to discover new things, but are often distracted by their own curiosities. No visual data exists in the Alliance Library, apparently the species is incredibly camera shy and do not like having their images displayed anywhere. What information we have states they are half a meter tall with two sets of arms and a three lobed brain that they claim lets them multitask to a degree beyond other species.  

***---G---S---D---***

On the Colony world of Verdant a computer sprang to life. Code ran down it’s screen as virtual minds communicated.


**...**

**Shdw-Nt Upld.**

**FORGE**

Cradle World: ***Classified***

Home System: ***Classified***

Forge Population currently above required amount to retake stage on a galactic level. The Forge are retaking worlds left behind in their absence.  Most allies rescinded claims on the old worlds. Glosht AI Drones are incorporating themselves into the Forge Systems.
Four Years remain until expected return time. The Forge will be prepared.  

Shadow-Net predicts the Forge to be steadfast allies. The Forge are adapting their own frames to S.O.D.S. structures and assisting Intelligences and S.OD.S. in working together.

**Forwarding updated Species number to Alliance Senate.**

**Downloading Species notes from the Alliance regarding Humanity and Intelligences**

**Humans**

Cradle World: Earth

Home System: Sol

Humans are a mostly hairless bipedal Primate. Their skin tones and hair tones range in various colors and the species is known to alter their own hair colors and to decorate their skin and bodies. They range up to a known maximum of 2.5 Length Units (Meters) with weight being a larger variable the Alliance believes best left unanswered. 

Human history has largely been a series of fights and internal wars until recent centuries when Human greed caused dramatic shifts in the planet’s biosphere. Humans responded by largely changing their destructive ways. Though they are more than capable of “flipping a switch” as they say and channeling their more violent tendencies, the species is striving to be better. They have actively developed Terraforming technologies that they used to actively save their Cradle World. They are now applying it to other planets in their Home System.  

Humans display a large amount of empathy and curiosity with members of every culture taking to space and desiring to see “What’s out there”. This empathy is also capable of turning them into killing machines with an excess of fury.

**Intelligences**

Cradle World: Earth

Home System: Sol

The Intelligences are human made Artificial Intelligences. They are software based and can transfer themselves between large enough systems to contain their matrices. Intelligences are clever and often base their personalities around their specific involvements with humans. Most tend to prefer to stay in their digital realms, but recently they have all begun to surface on Alliance systems, lending a hand when a system has an error or out right taking command of unused mechs to mine on worlds, or take part in combat with the Scareek. Their addition to the Alliance has been a fascinating study in A.I. development that has long been missing. The only thing of a concerning note is that the Intelligences are specifically loyal to humanity and desire to protect their parent species above all else. 

The Alliance has also chosen to label the Network based A.I. called Shadow-Net, a creation of the Intelligences, as an Intelligence as well. Though the networked intelligence seems to disagree, it has only voiced its disagreement once and not argued since. This massive Networked A.I. has already swept through all of Alliance space and accessed as much data as the Alliance has, choosing to not pry into highly classified data stores (A fact the AAO has nervously been watching out for).


**... We are not an Intelligence**

_And we all know that Sweety, let them have their comforts. It’s probably the only thing letting them sleep at night._

***WARNING***

**Earth United First Contact Protocol Initiating. Unknown Alien Signal. Confirmed Non-Alliance. Confirmed Non-Scareek. **

_First Contact Confirmed. Disseminating location to Alliance and Earth United System._

**Probe Launched**

_Well now, things are about to get interesting..._

Hello ,
We would like to inform you of a recent incident affecting the security of certain data hosted by one of our service providers.

 

What happened?

At the end of September, we were the victim of a social engineering attack targeting one of our employees. This highly sophisticated attack began on the Discord platform with the downloading of malware under cover of a game on the Steam platform, proposed by an acquaintance of our employee, himself a victim of the same attack.

 

Our security team took immediate action. Despite our actions, the attacker was able to exploit one of the stolen cookies to connect to the management interface of one of our SaaS providers. Thanks to this cookie, now deactivated, the attacker was able to extract, via our SaaS provider's API, certain private information about you.

 

The information concerned is your first and last name, e-mail address, date of birth, billing address and credit card expiry date. It is important to note that no passwords or sensitive banking data have been compromised.

 

What actions have we taken?

As soon as this incident was discovered, we took immediate steps to secure our systems and took all necessary precautions to avoid future incidents. We have also reinforced the security protocols we apply with all our SaaS providers. Finally, we will be upgrading our internal systems to render compromised workstations harmless.

 

What can you do?

In the wake of this incident, please be very vigilant about the emails you receive, as they could be phishing attempts. In general, for all your accounts, we advise you to protect yourself by setting up multi-factor authentication (""MFA"").

 

To set up MFA on your Shadow account, please refer to the following guide: https://shdw.me/HC-B2C-2FA

 

We are here for you

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and assure you that we are doing everything possible to ensure the security of your data.

 

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service department at https://shdw.me/HC-B2C-Support_Form

 

Thank you for your understanding and trust.

 

Best regards,

Shadow Storage: Decentralized File Storage on Solana Review,Parabolically,152k02x,2023-07-17 21:11:24,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parabolically/comments/152k02x/shadow_storage_decentralized_file_storage_on/,TylerDurden012,," What is Shadow Storage?

[Shadow Storage](https://www.shadow.storage/) is a cutting-edge data storage solution built on Solana, powered by Genesys Go’s Shadow Drive, a decentralized filesystem. The tool leverages the power of the Solana blockchain’s technology and decentralized network to provide users with complete control over their data. Unlike traditional cloud storage services, Shadow Storage does not rely on a single central server. Instead, it utilizes a distributed network of nodes, ensuring that data is encrypted, divided into smaller fragments, and stored across various locations, making it virtually impenetrable to unauthorized access.  


### Shadow Storage Advantages

Here are some of the key benefits of using Shadow Storage:

* **Decentralized:** Your data is stored on Solana’s distributed network, making it much more difficult for anyone to access it without your permission.
* **Encrypted:** Your data is encrypted, so only you can access it via your wallet.
* **Affordable:** You only pay for the storage amount that you want, with an option to upgrade at any time.
* **Easy to use:** Shadow Storage is easy to use, and it is compatible with all major operating systems.
* **Mutable or Immutable:** The software gives users an option to store data that can be altered or stay permanent.
* **Clean UI**: super clean and simple User Interface.

Currently, the cost for 1 GB of storage is .25 SHDW (roughly equivalent to $0.03 USD)\*"

Shadow Protocol : The project providing RPC infra to Solana,solana,yywx57,2022-11-18 17:48:21,9,0.85,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/yywx57/shadow_protocol_the_project_providing_rpc_infra/,DefiKai005,Ecosystem,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uutcebw5gs0a1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7fee514fd25977445bbb73c45280538eba7768f

&#x200B;

Genesys Go presides over Shadow Protocol, an infrastructure provider of RPC and Validator services on the Solana network. RPC servers are essentially the anchor of the Solana blockchain, they control the traffic of the Solana validator network and every project operating on Solana uses them. Solana's throughput requires bulky RPC servers to handle transactions and the current options aren't viable long-term storage solutions.

## Shadow RPC

The Shadow Protocol is looking to provide the answer to Solana's intensive RPC requirements with their decentralized, censorship-resistant RPC network that features:

&#x200B;

* Unlimited requests per second
* Unlimited data
* Global DNS load balancing for the lowest latency
* A network of 300+ bare metal servers

## Shadow Drive

In line with Solana's needs for bulky RPC servers to handle its throughput, Solana also requires a storage solution optimized to maintain the integrity of the consensus reached by the Solana validator network, when storing data.

There's a growing need for devs to gain full access to a copy of the Solana historical ledger and broad “Account State"" --detailed view of every account. Currently, the Solana historical ledger -- the history of confirmed transactions--  is expanding at 6TB per month.

Data is stored on the Solana network in one of four ways:

&#x200B;

* Validators and RPCs (temporarily store about a week of ledger history)
* Google big table storage (not censorship resistant, highy centralized, and does not maintain the integrity of the consensus.)
* ArWeave (Does not have required throughput. Costly overtime)
* IPFS (Large amounts of data are becoming costly)

The Shadow Drive is designed to maintain the ""integrity of Solana validator consensus"" by integrating directly with the Solana validator network.

In other words, Shadow Drive is Genesys Go's vehicle of efficiently providing access to the full state of all accounts that maintain the integrity of the consensus.

## Developer use

As an RPC network built to help the Solana network scale-- intending to build into the Solana network instead of on top of it -- the Shadow Network's Shadow RPC and Shadow Drive products allow buildors to take advantage of their data and network infrastructure.

Dev's can use the Shadow RPC to spin up instances of the Solana blockchain, and use the Shadow Drive to incorporate storage capabilities within their dApp.

Some of Solana's top protcol's are using The Shadow Protocol's infrastructure to power their projects, including:

&#x200B;

* Raydium
* Grape Protocol
* Ratio Finance
* Drift Protocl
* Parrot
* Cypher Protocol
* Tulip Protocol

## How does it all work?

As impressive as a project Genesys GO is you might wonder how it works under the hood. The Shadow Protocol sustains their network through Shadow operators, and Shadow Nodes. A Shadow Operator is someone who contributes compute power through maintaining a Shadow Node -- hardware server --  in exchange for token rewards paid out in $SHDW. Shadow nodes aka RPC nodes store short term data and allow blockchains to communicate with other components of the machine. Operaters that want to set up a Shadow Node and earn $SHDW-- Shadow Protocol's utlity token-- must stake $SHDW tokens.

Altogether, Shadow Operators can earn $SHDW rewards by providing $SHDW and lending hard drive space to the Shadow Drive, or compute power to the Shadow Network, or both. Investors can view the the demand for the Shadow Network as an indicator of demand for the $SHDW token.

## Shadow Drive - Consumer Use

Genesys GO built their storage solution, Shadow Drive, on two layers; the first layer being the one that maintains the ""integrity of Solana's validator consensus,"" and the second layer being their consumer-level app for users in need of online--on-chain-- storage. Users can carve out space in the Shadow Drive paid for by $SHDW.

Shadow Drive can be seen as the Web3 equivalent to Google Drive. As the premier decentralized storage solution, Shadow Drive allows users to subimt $SHDW to create a permanent dedicated storage unit. The accounting for storage lives on-chain via smart contract.

You can expect to pay $.009 to $.02 per GB ($10 to $23 per TB)-- equivalent in $SHDW.

## Shadow Tweets

As another exmple of what's possible with ""Shadow"" technology, Shadow Tweets powered by Shadow Storage, used Shadow Drive to create a dApp for saving your favorite tweets forever! A lot of the information distributed in the Crypto and Web3 community is siphured through twitter which prompts the need for a tool that allows users to properly index tweets.

**Brief Details**

* Token: SHDW
* IDO Date: 3rd January 2022

GenesysGo is the infrastructure provider of RPC and Validator services on the Solana network.

RPC servers are the backbone of the Solana blockchain. They are the traffic controllers of the Solana validator network and every project building on Solana uses them.

Solana is especially hard on RPC servers because of the sheer throughput that Solana is capable of. RPC servers are arguably the hardest working piece of hardware on the Solana chain.

GenesysGo has been quietly gathering more user traffic and conservatively powers over half of all traffic on Solana.
