**Question:**  
A PC GPU achieves a gaming performance of 130 FPS at a given resolution. Increasing the resolution by 78% reduces the performance to 105 FPS. Determine the expected performance if the resolution is increased by 25% instead of 78%.

**o1:**

To solve this, we can use the relationship between resolution and performance. GPU performance (in frames per second, FPS) typically decreases as resolution increases due to the increased number of pixels that need to be processed.

# Step 1: Relationship between Resolution and FPS

If we denote:

* R1R\_1R1​ as the original resolution,
* R2=R1×(1+0.78)R\_2 = R\_1 \\times (1 + 0.78)R2​=R1​×(1+0.78) as the increased resolution (by 78%),
* FPS1=130FPS\_1 = 130FPS1​=130 as the original FPS,
* FPS2=105FPS\_2 = 105FPS2​=105 as the FPS at R2R\_2R2​,

we can approximate the relationship between resolution and FPS using an inverse proportionality:

FPS∝Resolution1​

This implies:

FPS1FPS2=R2R1\\frac{FPS\_1}{FPS\_2} = \\frac{R\_2}{R\_1}FPS2​FPS1​​=R1​R2​​

# Step 2: Calculate the Constant

From the given data:

130105=R1×(1+0.78)R1\\frac{130}{105} = \\frac{R\_1 \\times (1 + 0.78)}{R\_1}105130​=R1​R1​×(1+0.78)​

Simplify:

130105=1.78\\frac{130}{105} = 1.78105130​=1.78

# Step 3: Find the New FPS for a 25% Increase

For a 25% increase in resolution:

R3=R1×(1+0.25)=R1×1.25R\_3 = R\_1 \\times (1 + 0.25) = R\_1 \\times 1.25R3​=R1​×(1+0.25)=R1​×1.25

Using the same proportionality:

FPS1FPS3=R3R1=1.25\\frac{FPS\_1}{FPS\_3} = \\frac{R\_3}{R\_1} = 1.25FPS3​FPS1​​=R1​R3​​=1.25

Rearrange to find FPS3FPS\_3FPS3​:

FPS3=FPS11.25FPS\_3 = \\frac{FPS\_1}{1.25}FPS3​=1.25FPS1​​

Substitute FPS1=130FPS\_1 = 130FPS1​=130:

FPS3=1301.25=104FPS\_3 = \\frac{130}{1.25} = 104FPS3​=1.25130​=104

# Final Answer:

The expected performance at a 25% resolution increase is approximately **104 FPS**

**Gemini:**

Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Understand the Relationship:**

We're dealing with an inverse relationship between resolution and FPS. As resolution increases, FPS decreases. We can model this with a power law relationship:

FPS = k / (Resolution)\^n

Where:

* FPS is the frames per second
* Resolution is a measure of the number of pixels (we'll use a relative measure here)
* k is a constant of proportionality
* n is an exponent that describes the strength of the relationship

**2. Set up Equations:**

Let's normalize the initial resolution to 1. This means:

* Initial Resolution: 1
* Initial FPS: 130

When the resolution is increased by 78%, the new resolution is 1 + 0.78 = 1.78. The FPS becomes 105. We can set up two equations:

* 130 = k / (1)\^n => k = 130
* 105 = 130 / (1.78)\^n

**3. Solve for n:**

Using the second equation:

* (1.78)\^n = 130 / 105
* (1.78)\^n ≈ 1.238
* Taking the logarithm of both sides (you can use any base, but natural log is common):
   * n \* ln(1.78) = ln(1.238)
   * n ≈ ln(1.238) / ln(1.78)
   * n ≈ 0.213 / 0.577
   * n ≈ 0.37

**4. Calculate FPS for a 25% Resolution Increase:**

If the resolution is increased by 25%, the new resolution is 1 + 0.25 = 1.25. Now we can use our equation with the calculated 'n' and 'k':

* FPS = 130 / (1.25)\^0.37
* FPS ≈ 130 / 1.087
* FPS ≈ 119.6

**5. Final Answer:**

The expected performance with a 25% resolution increase is approximately 120 FPS

**Claude 3-Sonnet:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the change in resolution and the change in performance, and then use it to calculate the expected performance when the resolution is increased by 25%.

Given information:

* Initial resolution: Let's denote it as R.
* Initial performance: 130 FPS.
* When the resolution is increased by 78%, the performance decreases to 105 FPS.

Step 1: Find the change in resolution and the corresponding change in performance when the resolution is increased by 78%.  
Change in resolution = R × 1.78 - R = 0.78R  
Change in performance = 130 - 105 = 25 FPS

Step 2: Assume a linear relationship between the change in resolution and the change in performance.  
Change in performance / Change in resolution = 25 FPS / (0.78R)  
= 25 / (0.78R) FPS per unit change in resolution

Step 3: Calculate the expected performance when the resolution is increased by 25%.  
Change in resolution = R × 1.25 - R = 0.25R  
Expected change in performance = (25 / (0.78R)) × 0.25R  
= 8.04 FPS

Step 4: Calculate the expected performance by subtracting the change in performance from the initial performance.  
Expected performance = Initial performance - Expected change in performance  
= 130 - 8.04  
= 121.96 FPS

Therefore, if the resolution is increased by 25%, the expected gaming performance of the PC GPU would be approximately 121.96 FPS

**DeepSeek-R1:**

Okay, so I need to figure out the expected performance of a GPU when the resolution is increased by 25%, given that increasing it by 78% reduces the FPS from 130 to 105. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, I know that increasing the resolution usually puts more load on the GPU because there are more pixels to render. Therefore, the frame rate (FPS) tends to decrease as resolution increases. The question is asking how much the FPS will drop if we increase the resolution by a smaller percentage (25%) instead of the original 78%.

The original resolution isn't given, but maybe I can model the relationship between resolution and performance. Typically, performance (in FPS) is inversely proportional to the resolution, assuming all other factors remain constant. That is, if you double the resolution, the FPS should halve, right? Because the GPU has to work twice as hard per frame. But maybe this isn't exactly linear? Or perhaps it's a different relationship?

Wait, let me think. Resolution is measured in pixels, which is width multiplied by height. So increasing the resolution by 78% would mean increasing both the width and height by some percentage? Or is it increasing the total number of pixels by 78%? The problem says ""increasing the resolution by 78%"", so I think that means the total number of pixels increases by 78%. So if the original resolution is, say, X pixels, then the new resolution is X + 0.78X = 1.78X. Therefore, the pixel count is multiplied by 1.78.

Similarly, increasing the resolution by 25% would mean the new resolution is 1.25 times the original pixel count.

If performance is inversely proportional to the resolution (pixel count), then FPS1 \* Res1 = FPS2 \* Res2. So FPS2 = FPS1 \* (Res1 / Res2). But let me check if that holds with the given numbers.

Original FPS is 130 at original resolution. After increasing resolution by 78%, the new FPS is 105. Let's see if 130 / 105 equals the ratio of the new resolution to the original resolution.

130 / 105 ≈ 1.238. But the resolution increased by 78%, so the new resolution is 1.78 times the original. But 1.78 is much larger than 1.238. Hmm, so that doesn't match. Therefore, the relationship isn't a direct inverse proportionality. Maybe the relationship is that FPS is inversely proportional to the increase in resolution?

Wait, perhaps the scaling is different. Maybe it's not linear with resolution, but with some other factor. Let me think. For example, in 3D rendering, the number of pixels directly affects the fill rate and the workload for the GPU. So if you have more pixels, each frame takes more time to render, hence lower FPS. If the resolution scales by a factor of k, then the time per frame scales by k, so FPS scales by 1/k.

So if the resolution is multiplied by k, FPS is divided by k. Therefore, FPS2 = FPS1 / k.

Let me check with the given numbers. Original FPS is 130. After increasing resolution by 78%, the resolution becomes 1.78 times the original. So according to this model, the new FPS should be 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73.03. But the problem states that the FPS is reduced to 105, which is much higher than 73.03. Therefore, this model isn't correct. So my assumption that FPS is inversely proportional to resolution must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe the relationship isn't linear? Maybe it's a different kind of relationship. Perhaps the performance scales with the square root of the resolution? Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the workload scales with resolution, but other factors like memory bandwidth or processing power come into play. But without specific technical details, perhaps I need to find an empirical relationship based on the given data.

So, given that increasing the resolution by 78% causes the FPS to drop from 130 to 105, maybe I can model the relationship between resolution scale and FPS. Let's denote the original resolution as R. Then, increasing it by 78% makes it 1.78R. The FPS drops from 130 to 105. So the ratio of FPS is 105/130 ≈ 0.8077. So the FPS is about 80.77% of the original when the resolution is increased by 78%.

If I can find the relationship between the resolution scale factor (k) and the FPS ratio (FPS\_new / FPS\_old), maybe I can model it as a linear relationship? Or perhaps some exponential relationship?

Wait, let's think in terms of scaling factors. Let me denote k as the scale factor for resolution. So k = 1.78 for a 78% increase. Then, FPS\_new = FPS\_old \* (1 / k\^a), where 'a' is some exponent. So we can solve for 'a' using the given data.

So 105 = 130 / (1.78)\^a

Therefore, (1.78)\^a = 130 / 105 ≈ 1.238

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

a \* ln(1.78) = ln(1.238)

Therefore, a = ln(1.238) / ln(1.78) ≈ (0.213) / (0.576) ≈ 0.369

So the exponent a is approximately 0.369.

Therefore, the relationship is FPS\_new = FPS\_old / (k)\^0.369

So, for a 25% increase in resolution, k = 1.25. Then,

FPS\_new = 130 / (1.25)\^0.369

Calculate 1.25\^0.369:

First, take ln(1.25) ≈ 0.223, multiply by 0.369 ≈ 0.0824

Exponentiate: e\^0.0824 ≈ 1.086

Therefore, FPS\_new ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7

So approximately 120 FPS.

But let me check this calculation again step by step to make sure.

First, original data:

When resolution is increased by 78%, so k = 1 + 0.78 = 1.78.

FPS drops from 130 to 105.

Assuming the formula is FPS\_new = FPS\_old / (k)\^a, solve for a:

105 = 130 / (1.78)\^a

Multiply both sides by (1.78)\^a:

105 \* (1.78)\^a = 130

Divide both sides by 105:

(1.78)\^a = 130 / 105 ≈ 1.2381

Take natural log:

a \* ln(1.78) = ln(1.2381)

Calculate ln(1.78): ln(1.78) ≈ 0.5766

ln(1.2381) ≈ 0.2134

Therefore, a ≈ 0.2134 / 0.5766 ≈ 0.3698

So, a ≈ 0.37

Therefore, the formula is FPS\_new = 130 / (k)\^0.37

Now, for a 25% increase in resolution, k = 1.25.

Compute 1.25\^0.37:

Again, take natural log of 1.25: ln(1.25) ≈ 0.2231

Multiply by 0.37: 0.2231 \* 0.37 ≈ 0.0825

Exponentiate: e\^0.0825 ≈ 1.086

Therefore, FPS\_new ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7, so approximately 120 FPS.

But let me check using another method. Alternatively, compute 1.25\^0.37 directly.

1.25\^0.37. Let's compute this step by step.

First, note that 1.25 is 5/4. So (5/4)\^0.37.

Alternatively, use logarithms. Let me use base 10 for easier calculation.

log10(1.25) ≈ 0.09691

Multiply by 0.37: 0.09691 \* 0.37 ≈ 0.03586

Then, 10\^0.03586 ≈ 1.086. So same result. Therefore, 1.25\^0.37 ≈ 1.086.

Thus, 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7. So approximately 120.

But let me check this with another approach. Maybe the scaling is linear? If a 78% increase causes a 130 to 105 drop, then how much does a 25% increase cause?

Alternatively, maybe it's a linear relationship between resolution increase and FPS decrease. But that might not be accurate. Let's see.

If we consider that increasing resolution by 78% leads to a performance decrease of (130 - 105)/130 = 25/130 ≈ 19.23%. So a 78% resolution increase causes a 19.23% decrease in FPS.

But if the relationship is linear, then a 25% resolution increase would cause a (25/78)\*19.23% ≈ (0.3205)\*19.23 ≈ 6.16% decrease. Then FPS would be 130\*(1 - 0.0616) ≈ 130\*0.9384 ≈ 122. So around 122 FPS. But this is a different result than the previous method.

But which one is correct? Since the first method models the relationship as a power law, and the second as a linear relationship. But in reality, the relationship between resolution and performance is usually not linear. Since resolution scales with the number of pixels, which is a multiplicative factor on both width and height. So increasing resolution by 78% (assuming in both dimensions) would actually multiply the pixel count by (1 + 0.78). Wait, no. Wait, resolution is usually given as width x height. So a 78% increase in resolution could be ambiguous. Is it 78% increase in each dimension, leading to a total pixel increase of (1.78)\^2 - 1 = 2.1684, which is 116.84% increase in total pixels? Or is the 78% increase referring to total pixels?

This is a critical point. The problem states ""increasing the resolution by 78%"". The term ""resolution"" can be ambiguous. In common usage, increasing resolution by a percentage usually refers to increasing each dimension by that percentage, thereby increasing the total number of pixels by the square of that factor. For example, increasing resolution by 100% (doubling) each dimension would result in 4x the pixels. However, sometimes people might refer to the total pixel count. The problem doesn't specify, but given that increasing resolution by 78% leads to a decrease in FPS from 130 to 105, we need to figure out which interpretation fits.

If it's a 78% increase in each dimension, then total pixels become (1.78)\^2 = 3.1684 times the original, which is a 216.84% increase in total pixels. However, such a massive increase in pixels would likely result in a much larger drop in FPS, but in the problem, the FPS only drops from 130 to 105. Therefore, this suggests that the 78% increase is in total pixels, not per dimension.

Therefore, the problem likely means that the total resolution (number of pixels) is increased by 78%, so the new resolution is 1.78 times the original. Similarly, increasing by 25% would mean 1.25 times the original pixel count.

Given that, then going back, if the total pixels are 1.78 times, then the FPS is 105, which is 130 / 1.78\^a ≈ 105. We found a ≈ 0.37. So, this seems like a reasonable model.

Alternatively, if we model it as the time per frame being proportional to the number of pixels, then FPS is inversely proportional to the number of pixels. But according to that, FPS would be 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73, which is not the case here. Therefore, that model is invalid. So perhaps the workload isn't strictly linear with resolution. Maybe due to other factors like reduced CPU bottleneck or something else. But given that we have to work with the numbers provided, we can model the relationship as a power law where FPS scales as 1 / k\^a, with a ≈ 0.37.

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is linear in terms of some other factor. Let's see. Let me try to check with the given numbers.

Original FPS: 130 at resolution R.

After increasing resolution to 1.78R, FPS becomes 105.

Suppose the relationship is FPS = C / R\^a, where C is a constant.

So, 130 = C / R\^a

105 = C / (1.78R)\^a

Divide the first equation by the second:

130 / 105 = (C / R\^a) / (C / (1.78R)\^a) ) = (1.78R)\^a / R\^a = 1.78\^a

Therefore, 130/105 = 1.78\^a

Which is the same as before. So 1.78\^a = 130/105 ≈ 1.2381

Therefore, a ≈ 0.3698 as before.

Therefore, using this model, for a resolution increase of 25%, which is 1.25R, then FPS = 130 / (1.25)\^0.3698 ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7, so \~120 FPS.

But let me check another way. If we think of the exponent 'a' as representing how much the performance scales with resolution. If a = 1, it's inverse linear (double the resolution, half the FPS). Here, a ≈ 0.37, which is less than 1, meaning that the FPS doesn't drop as much as inverse linear. So the drop is less severe. So, increasing resolution by 25% would result in FPS dropping by a factor of 1.25\^0.37 ≈ 1.086, so \~8.6% decrease, leading to 130 / 1.086 ≈ 120.

Alternatively, since 78% increase corresponds to a factor of 1.78, and 25% is 1.25. So, maybe we can use the ratio between the two.

Wait, but how? Maybe we can set up a proportion. If a 78% increase leads to a certain performance drop, then a 25% increase would lead to a proportionally smaller drop.

But that might not be accurate unless the relationship is linear, which we already saw isn't the case.

Alternatively, using the same exponent, which we calculated as \~0.37, then for any resolution scale factor k, the FPS is 130 / k\^0.37.

So for k=1.25, FPS=130 / 1.25\^0.37 ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7.

Alternatively, perhaps use logarithms to interpolate. Wait, but we already did that with the exponent.

Alternatively, think in terms of percentage decrease. If going from 100% res to 178% res (78% increase), the FPS goes from 130 to 105. So, the FPS multiplier is 105/130 ≈ 0.8077 over a resolution multiplier of 1.78.

Similarly, for a resolution multiplier of 1.25, the FPS multiplier would be (1.25 / 1.78)\^(log(0.8077)/log(1.78))? Wait, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, since we have a power law established, FPS = 130 \* (1 / k)\^0.3698, then for k=1.25, FPS = 130 / 1.25\^0.3698 ≈ 119.7. Therefore, the answer is approximately 120 FPS.

But maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's consider that the performance is inversely proportional to the resolution. So, FPS \* Resolution = constant.

But when we check with the given numbers, 130 \* R = constant, and 105 \* 1.78R = constant. So:

130R = 105 \* 1.78R

Divide both sides by R: 130 = 105 \* 1.78

Calculate 105\*1.78: 105\*1.78 = 105\*(1 + 0.78) = 105 + 105\*0.78 = 105 + 81.9 = 186.9

But 130 ≠ 186.9, so this is false. Therefore, the relationship is not FPS inversely proportional to resolution. Therefore, that approach is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the performance scales with the square root of the resolution? That is, FPS is inversely proportional to the square root of the resolution. So FPS1 \* sqrt(Res1) = FPS2 \* sqrt(Res2).

Testing this: 130 \* sqrt(R) = 105 \* sqrt(1.78R)

Divide both sides by sqrt(R): 130 = 105 \* sqrt(1.78)

Calculate sqrt(1.78) ≈ 1.334

So 105 \* 1.334 ≈ 140.07 ≈ 130? No, 140 ≠ 130. Therefore, this model is also invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the relationship is that FPS scales with the inverse of the resolution raised to some power, which we have already determined via the exponent a ≈ 0.37.

Therefore, unless there's another way to model this, the most accurate approach based on the given data is the power law relationship with exponent \~0.37.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the difference in resolution and the difference in FPS. So, from 100% to 178%, which is +78%, the FPS decreases by 25 (from 130 to 105). So, per 1% increase in resolution, the FPS decreases by 25/78 ≈ 0.3205 FPS per percentage point. Then, for a 25% increase, the decrease would be 25 \* 0.3205 ≈ 8.01 FPS, leading to 130 - 8.01 ≈ 121.99 FPS. So approximately 122 FPS. But this is a linear approximation, which may not be correct because the relationship is likely non-linear.

But which approach is correct? Since we have only two data points, it's impossible to know the true relationship. However, in real-world scenarios, GPU performance doesn't scale linearly with resolution. It's more common for FPS to be inversely proportional to the resolution (i.e., linear with the number of pixels), but in this case, that doesn't fit because 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73, which doesn't match the given 105.

Therefore, given the discrepancy, the problem must be assuming a different relationship. Perhaps the question is simplified, and the performance hit is linear with the percentage increase in resolution. That is, each percentage increase in resolution causes a fixed percentage decrease in FPS.

Wait, let's try that. If increasing resolution by 78% causes FPS to drop from 130 to 105, which is a decrease of (130 - 105)/130 = 25/130 ≈ 19.23%. So, 19.23% decrease for a 78% increase in resolution. So, the performance scales as (1 - 0.1923) = 0.8077 for a 78% increase.

If we model this as a linear relationship where each 1% increase in resolution causes a (19.23/78)% ≈ 0.246% decrease in FPS. Then, for a 25% increase in resolution, the FPS decrease would be 25 \* 0.246% ≈ 6.15%, resulting in FPS = 130 \* (1 - 0.0615) ≈ 130 \* 0.9385 ≈ 122. So 122 FPS. But again, this assumes a linear relationship which might not hold.

But in reality, performance scaling with resolution is more complex. However, given that the problem provides only two data points, we have to assume some model. The question is, which model is the problem expecting?

The two possible models I can think of are:

1. Power law relationship where FPS is inversely proportional to resolution raised to some exponent (which we calculated as \~0.37), leading to \~120 FPS.
2. Linear relationship where the FPS decrease is proportional to the resolution increase, leading to \~122 FPS.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the resolution increase as per-axis, so that total pixels increase by (1.78)\^2. Let's check that.

Wait, if increasing resolution by 78% per axis, then total pixels would be (1.78)\^2 = 3.1684 times original. Then, if FPS is inversely proportional to total pixels, then FPS would be 130 / 3.1684 ≈ 41.03. But given that the problem states FPS is 105, this is inconsistent. Therefore, the problem must be referring to total resolution increase, not per-axis.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in terms of pixel density or something else. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a simple percentage calculation. If a 78% increase in resolution causes a (130 - 105)/130 = \~19.23% decrease in FPS, then a 25% increase would cause a (25/78)\*19.23% ≈ 6.15% decrease, leading to 130\*(1 - 0.0615) ≈ 122 FPS.

But this is a linear extrapolation, which is simplistic but might be what's expected here.

Alternatively, the problem might assume that the performance is inversely proportional to the resolution. Then, if resolution increases by 78%, the FPS should be 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73, but since it's given as 105, this model is invalid. So the problem must be expecting a different approach.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is referring to the resolution scaling in one dimension? For example, increasing the resolution by 78% in one dimension (width or height), thereby increasing the total pixel count by 78%. But that's not standard. Usually, resolution is increased proportionally in both dimensions.

But if the problem states a 78% increase in resolution, and it's referring to the total number of pixels, then the pixel count is 1.78 times the original. Therefore, the scaling factor for resolution is 1.78, and the FPS is 105. Then, to find the scaling factor for a 25% increase in resolution (pixel count 1.25 times original), leading to FPS = ?

Given that, and assuming a power law relationship between resolution and FPS, we determined the exponent a ≈ 0.37. Therefore, the expected FPS is \~120.

Alternatively, the problem might be expecting the assumption that performance scales with the inverse of the resolution, but since that doesn't match the given data, perhaps the answer is derived from the ratio of the resolution increases.

Wait, here's another approach. The performance decreased by a factor of 105/130 ≈ 0.8077 when the resolution increased by a factor of 1.78. So, the performance scales by 0.8077 when the resolution scales by 1.78.

If we want to find the performance when the resolution scales by 1.25, we can set up a proportion:

(1.78 / 1.25) = (0.8077 / x)

But this is not a direct proportion. Alternatively, if we consider that the scaling factor for performance is (1.78 / new\_resolution\_factor) \* 0.8077? Not sure.

Alternatively, use linear interpolation on a log scale. Since the relationship is a power law, which is linear in log-log space.

Take the log of both resolution scale and performance scale.

Original data point:

Resolution scale: 1.78 (log(1.78) ≈ 0.5766)

Performance scale: 0.8077 (log(0.8077) ≈ -0.2134)

For a new resolution scale of 1.25 (log(1.25) ≈ 0.09691), we can find the corresponding performance scale.

Assuming a linear relationship in log-log space, which corresponds to a power law in linear space.

The slope of the line in log-log space is (log(0.8077) - log(1)) / (log(1.78) - log(1)) = (-0.2134 - 0) / (0.5766 - 0) ≈ -0.2134 / 0.5766 ≈ -0.3698

So the slope is approximately -0.3698, which is the exponent 'a' we found earlier.

Therefore, the equation in log-log space is:

log(performance\_scale) = slope \* log(resolution\_scale) + intercept

We know that when resolution\_scale = 1, performance\_scale = 1. Therefore, the intercept is 0.

Therefore, log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(resolution\_scale)

Therefore, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0359

Exponentiate both sides:

performance\_scale ≈ e\^(-0.0359) ≈ 0.9647

Therefore, the performance scale is \~0.9647, so FPS = 130 \* 0.9647 ≈ 125.4

Wait, this contradicts our previous result. Wait, why is that?

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, if the original performance scale is 0.8077 when resolution scale is 1.78, and we model it as a power law, then performance\_scale = (resolution\_scale)\^-a, where a ≈ 0.3698.

Therefore, for resolution\_scale = 1.25, performance\_scale = 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ 0.921, so FPS = 130 \* 0.921 ≈ 119.7, which matches the previous result.

But in the log-log space approach above, I get performance\_scale ≈ 0.9647, leading to \~125 FPS. That must be an error. Wait, let's re-examine.

Wait, the equation in log-log space is:

log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale)

Given that when resolution\_scale = 1.78, performance\_scale = 0.8077.

So:

log(0.8077) = -a \* log(1.78)

Therefore, a = -log(0.8077)/log(1.78) ≈ -(-0.2134)/0.5766 ≈ 0.3698

Therefore, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0359

So performance\_scale = e\^(-0.0359) ≈ 0.9647

Wait, but that can't be, because when resolution\_scale = 1, performance\_scale = 1, and for higher resolution scales, performance\_scale decreases. But according to this, at resolution\_scale = 1.25, performance\_scale is \~0.9647, meaning FPS = 130 \* 0.9647 ≈ 125.4. But according to the power law formula, it should be 130 / (1.25)\^0.3698 ≈ 119.7.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, no, actually, in the power law formula, performance\_scale = 1 / (resolution\_scale)\^a = (resolution\_scale)\^-a

Therefore, if we take logs:

log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale)

But when I computed performance\_scale = e\^(-0.0359) ≈ 0.9647, that is correct. However, 0.9647 is relative to the original performance. So FPS = 130 \* 0.9647 ≈ 125.4. But according to the direct calculation using the power law exponent, it's 130 / (1.25)\^0.3698 ≈ 119.7.

Wait, that can't be both. Where is the mistake?

Wait, no. Wait, in the power law formula, performance\_scale is (FPS\_new / FPS\_old) = (resolution\_scale)\^-a

Therefore, (FPS\_new / 130) = (1.25)\^-0.3698 ≈ 0.921

Therefore, FPS\_new ≈ 130 \* 0.921 ≈ 119.7

But in the log-log space calculation, I get performance\_scale ≈ 0.9647. That suggests inconsistency. Therefore, I must have messed up the log-log space calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, if performance\_scale = (resolution\_scale)\^-a, then log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale). So, given that a ≈ 0.3698,

For resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0359

Therefore, performance\_scale = e\^{-0.0359} ≈ 0.9647

Wait, but 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* ln(1.25)} ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* 0.2231} ≈ e\^{-0.0824} ≈ 0.921

Ah! Here's the mistake. I used natural logarithm in one place and base 10 in another? Wait, no. Wait, let's recast.

The formula is performance\_scale = (resolution\_scale)\^-a

So, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

performance\_scale = 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* ln(1.25)} ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* 0.2231} ≈ e\^{-0.0824} ≈ 0.921

But when I computed log(performance\_scale) as -0.0359, I was using log base 10. Wait, no. Wait, in the previous calculation, I used natural logarithm for the logs.

Wait, in the log-log space approach, if we are using natural logs, then:

log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale)

Where log is natural log.

So, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* ln(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.2231 ≈ -0.0824

Therefore, performance\_scale = e\^{-0.0824} ≈ 0.921

Which matches the direct calculation. Therefore, my previous log-log space calculation was incorrect because I used base 10 logs instead of natural logs. That was the mistake.

Therefore, the correct calculation is performance\_scale ≈ 0.921, leading to FPS ≈ 119.7, so \~120.

Therefore, the previous result of \~120 FPS is correct.

Thus, the answer should be approximately 120 FPS.

But let's check one more time for errors.

Original data: scaling resolution by 1.78 leads to FPS scaling by 105/130 ≈ 0.8077.

Assuming power law: 0.8077 = 1.78\^-a => a ≈ 0.3698.

For resolution scale 1.25, FPS scale = 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ 0.921, so FPS ≈ 130 \* 0.921 ≈ 119.7.

Yes, so approximately 120.

Alternatively, if we use log base 10:

log10(0.8077) ≈ -0.0924

log10(1.78) ≈ 0.2504

Slope a = -0.0924 / 0.2504 ≈ -0.369, same as before.

For resolution scale 1.25, log10(1.25) ≈ 0.09691

log10(performance\_scale) = -0.369 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0357

performance\_scale = 10\^-0.0357 ≈ 0.921, same result.

Therefore, regardless of the logarithm base, we get performance\_scale ≈ 0.921, leading to \~120 FPS.

Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.

\*\*Final Answer\*\*

The expected performance is \\boxed{120} FPS

Given that a PC GPU achieves 130 FPS at a certain resolution, and increasing the resolution by 78% reduces the performance to 105 FPS, we need to determine the expected performance if the resolution is increased by 25% instead.

1. **Understanding the relationship between resolution and performance**:
   * The original resolution is R*R*.
   * Increasing the resolution by 78% results in a new resolution of 1.78R1.78*R*.
   * The performance drops from 130 FPS to 105 FPS.
2. **Modeling the relationship**:
   * We assume a power law relationship between resolution and FPS: FPS∝1ResolutionaFPS∝Resolution*a*1​.
   * Using the given data, we solve for the exponent a*a*:105=130(1.78)a105=(1.78)*a*130​(1.78)a=130105≈1.2381(1.78)*a*=105130​≈1.2381Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:a⋅ln⁡(1.78)=ln⁡(1.2381)*a*⋅ln(1.78)=ln(1.2381)a≈ln⁡(1.2381)ln⁡(1.78)≈0.21340.5766≈0.3698*a*≈ln(1.78)ln(1.2381)​≈0.57660.2134​≈0.3698

Notes on Deepseek r1: Just how good it is compared to OpenAI o1,OpenAI,1i9vjg7,2025-01-25 14:59:50,0,0.42,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i9vjg7/notes_on_deepseek_r1_just_how_good_it_is_compared/,SunilKumarDash,Discussion,"Finally, there is a model worthy of the hype it has been getting since Claude 3.6 Sonnet. Deepseek has released something anyone hardly expected: a reasoning model on par with OpenAI’s o1 within a month of the v3 release, with an MIT license and 1/20th of o1’s cost.

This is easily the best release since GPT-4. It's wild; the general public seems excited about this, while the big AI labs are probably scrambling. It feels like things are about to speed up in the AI world. And it's all thanks to this new DeepSeek-R1 model and how they trained it. 

Some key details from the paper

* Pure RL (GRPO) on v3-base to get r1-zero. (No Monte-Carlo Tree Search or Process Reward Modelling)
* The model uses “Aha moments” as pivot tokens to reflect and reevaluate answers during CoT.
* To overcome r1-zero’s readability issues, v3 was SFTd on cold start data.
* Distillation works, small models like Qwen and Llama trained over r1 generated data show significant improvements.

Here’s an overall r0 pipeline

* v3 base + RL (GRPO) → r1-zero

r1 training pipeline.

1. **DeepSeek-V3 Base** \+ SFT (Cold Start Data) → **Checkpoint 1**
2. **Checkpoint 1** \+ RL (GRPO + Language Consistency) → **Checkpoint 2**
3. **Checkpoint 2** used to Generate Data (Rejection Sampling)
4. **DeepSeek-V3 Base** \+ SFT (Generated Data + Other Data) → **Checkpoint 3**
5. **Checkpoint 3** \+ RL (Reasoning + Preference Rewards) → **DeepSeek-R1**

We know the benchmarks, but just how good is it?

# Deepseek r1 vs OpenAI o1.

So, for this, I tested r1 and o1 side by side on complex reasoning, math, coding, and creative writing problems. These are the questions that o1 solved only or by none before.

Here’s what I found:

* For **reasoning**, it is much better than any previous SOTA model until o1. It is better than o1-preview but a notch below o1. This is also shown in the ARC AGI bench.
* **Mathematics**: It's also the same for mathematics; r1 is a killer, but o1 is better.
* **Coding**: I didn’t get to play much, but on first look, it’s up there with o1, and the fact that it costs 20x less makes it the practical winner.
* **Writing**: This is where R1 takes the lead. It gives the same vibes as early Opus. It’s free, less censored, has much more personality, is easy to steer, and is very creative compared to the rest, even o1-pro.

What interested me was how free the model sounded and thought traces were, akin to human internal monologue. Perhaps this is because of the less stringent RLHF, unlike US models.

The fact that you can get r1 from v3 via pure RL was the most surprising.

Update on Trade Window Results,HuntShowdown,1i9v9wt,2025-01-25 14:47:50,80,0.91,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/1i9v9wt/update_on_trade_window_results/,HuntShowdownOfficial,:cry-w: OFFICIAL,"Back in October, we shared details of upcoming hit validation and trade window improvements that went live with Update 2.2. Since the changes have been allowed to play out in a live environment, we wanted to circle back with an overview of the results and improvements observed so far. 

To recap, we adjusted the specific time limit for how long a player can still shoot or land a hit after death from 800 to 75 milliseconds. Our goal was to fine tune the system to create a fairer and more consistent ecosystem for everyone, prioritizing player reaction times over external factors like connection speed. 

Now to the results: 

**Kill Trades VS Total Player Kills:** 

https://preview.redd.it/kjan3pjz17fe1.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e137084dfb97bee8a9b8b56dfb70820972e4d7f

One of the key metrics we’ve been closely monitoring since rolling out the trade window adjustment is the percentage of kills that qualify as ""Trade."" A kill trade specifically occurs when two players eliminate each other within a specified window. This definition encompasses a variety of scenarios, from intentional gameplay mechanics like bleeding out or being taken down by a well-timed throwable, to the ""bad trades"" that have been a source of community concern. 

Our data shows a clear and sustained decline in the percentage of kill trades since the update went live. In fact, the figure has effectively been halved compared to pre-update levels. This is a substantial improvement and highlights the tangible impact of the recent changes on gameplay dynamics.  

(Please note the large spike on December 12^(th) is due to restricted data during server downtime as Update 2.2 was rolled out) 

**Hit Invalidations:** 

https://preview.redd.it/glc9f2i027fe1.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cd124a1b8588ebbd068224ecb83ede908c66a49

We also analyzed the percentage of hit invalidations with our 2.2 adjustments, which refers to the instances where a shot does not register as intended, which can significantly affect combat, outcomes, and player satisfaction. The goal with this change was to prevent hit validation from attacks made by players who were already marked as downed on the server. 

As anticipated, we have been able to track a significant rise in the number of invalidated attacks following the update.  

To better understand the context behind this, we went on to analyze the root causes of invalidations, both before and after the update. Before changes went live with 2.2, most invalidated hits stemmed from general timeouts. This meant a damage request took too long to reach the server, usually due to connectivity issues between the player and the server.  

Following the update, we can see the landscape has changed significantly. The leading cause of invalidations is now projectile launch prevention. This occurs when a shot is rejected at the moment of launch because the shooter was already downed and beyond the 75 millisecond death threshold.  

**Conclusion:** 

By addressing community feedback and fine-tuning the mechanics contributing to unfair kill trades, we’ve made measurable progress in creating a more balanced and satisfying experience. 

We are always working to refine gameplay in Hunt, and we will continue to share updates and insights as we do. As always, we thank you for your feedback, and happy hunting!

How to make GA4 happy with my Substack and GDPR,Substack,1i9u7b7,2025-01-25 14:01:28,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Substack/comments/1i9u7b7/how_to_make_ga4_happy_with_my_substack_and_gdpr/,CocktailWonk,,"I know this will sound like a GA4 question, but it's really a Substack / GDPR question.

**Problem:** GA4 thinks that my EU users aren't being given the option to control data collection.

**Details:** When someone in the EU goes to my Substack site, do they seem some sort of banner that allows them to accept or deny cookies? (I'm in the US, so wouldn't see it).

And if EU visitors ARE seeing a cookie allow/deny banner, this information doesn't appear to flow to Google Analytics?

I've looked all over in my Substack settings, and online, and can't find a clear answer about how Substack handles GDPR with EU visitors.

**Technical Details**  
Today was looking at Google Analytics (GA4) for my Substack. On the main Analytics page it says:

""Verify your consent settings for end users in the European Economic Area (EEA)""

On the ""Data Collection and Modifications | Consent Settings page"", it says  
  
***""4 issues detected in this property. Data missing consent signals may impact your measurement capabilities.***

***Missing 1 consent signal"".***

Here are some actionable tips to help you optimize your profile effectively.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/can-you-make-money-affiliate-marketing-on-pinterest  
  
### Craft a Catchy Profile Name

Your profile name should be succinct yet descriptive. Aim for something that clearly defines who you are or what niche you're targeting. Including keywords related to your affiliate marketing focus can improve discoverability. For instance, if you’re promoting eco-friendly products, consider including terms like “Eco-Friendly Living” in your name.

Switching to a Pinterest Business Account provides access to valuable tools like analytics and advertising features. This allows you to track the performance of your pins and refine your strategies based on what works best.

### Design Eye-Catching Profile Picture

Your profile picture should be clear and professional. If you're an individual, consider using a high-quality headshot. If you're representing a brand, your logo is a great choice. An appealing profile picture adds credibility and makes your profile more inviting.

Pinterest is a social platform, so interaction is crucial. Follow users in your niche, repin their content, and leave comments. Engaging with others can increase your visibility and attract followers to your profile.

Consistency is key in building a successful Pinterest presence. Aim to pin regularly and engage with your audience. Consider using scheduling tools like Tailwind to schedule your pins in advance and maintain a steady flow of content.

Ban TikTok in the United States: Stop the Chinese Communist Party's Influence,u_Impressive_Act_2709,1i9tj5t,2025-01-25 13:32:30,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Impressive_Act_2709/comments/1i9tj5t/ban_tiktok_in_the_united_states_stop_the_chinese/,Impressive_Act_2709,,"TikTok, a social media platform owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has raised significant concerns about its role in spreading the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the United States. This app, which has gained immense popularity, poses risks that can no longer be ignored.





The reasons to ban TikTok include:





1.    Data Privacy and National Security Risks: TikTok collects vast amounts of user data, including sensitive information. Given ByteDance’s ties to China, there is a legitimate fear that this data could be accessed or exploited by the CCP for surveillance or other purposes, posing a serious threat to U.S. national security.

2.    Disinformation and Propaganda: TikTok has been criticized for spreading false information and propaganda that could serve CCP interests, influencing public opinion and potentially destabilizing democratic processes.

3.    Support Human Rights in China: The Chinese government imposes strict internet censorship through its ""Great Firewall,"" which blocks platforms like 𝕏 (formerly Twitter), Facebook, YouTube, and independent news sources. While the Chinese people are denied the freedom to access information and express themselves online, TikTok—a platform owned by a Chinese company—operates freely in democratic countries like the United States. Banning TikTok would send a strong message in support of internet freedom and human rights, highlighting the double standards imposed by the Chinese government.



4.    The Role of Wealthy Interests: Billionaires like Elon Musk and others have supported TikTok due to commercial interests, prioritizing profits over concerns about CCP influence. Musk himself has a long history of aligning with the Chinese government to protect his business ventures in the region.

TikTok is not just a harmless app; it is a tool that can be used to expand the reach of the Chinese Communist Party into the everyday lives of Americans. We cannot allow this to continue unchecked.





We call on the U.S. Congress, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take immediate action to investigate TikTok’s practices and ties to the CCP. Whether by banning the platform or enforcing strict regulations, decisive measures are needed to protect U.S. citizens and safeguard national security.





Call to Action

Sign this petition to demand an end to TikTok’s operations in the United States and to limit the influence of the Chinese Communist Party on American society. Together, we can protect our freedoms, our data, and our democracy."

1. “Too much knowledge never makes for simple decisions”
2. “Among the responsibilities of command is the necessity to punish… but only when the victim demands it”
3. “The haughty do but build castle walls behind which they try to hide their doubts and fears”
4. “When we try to conceal our innermost drives, the entire being screams betrayal”
5.  “Nature’s beauteous form contains a lovely essence called by some - decay. By this lovely presence new life finds its way. Tears shed silently are but water of the soul. They bring new life to the pain of being - a separation from that seeing which death makes whole”
6. “The universe is God’s. It is one thing, a wholeness which all separations may be identified. Transient life, even that self aware and reasoning life which we call sentient, hold only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness”
7. “The universe can be grasped only by the sentient hand. That hand is what drives your precious brain. You see what you have created, you become sentient, only after the hand has done it’s work!”
8. “When your actions describe a system of evil consequences, you should be judged by those consequences and not by your explanations”
9. “From one viewpoint, child, each creation represents a catastrophe”
10. “The purpose of argument is to change the nature of truth”
11. “A sophisticated human can become primitive. What this really means is that the human's way of life changes. Old values change, become linked to the landscape with its plants and animals. This new existence requires a working knowledge of those multiplex and cross-linked events usually referred to as nature. It requires a measure of respect for the inertial power within such natural systems. When a human gains this working knowledge and respect, that is called being primitive. The converse, of course, is equally true: the primitive can become sophisticated, but not without accepting dreadful psychological damage”
12. “The joy of living, it’s beauty is all bound up in the fact that life can surprise you”
13. “Logics useless unless it’s armed with essential data”
14. “Power attracts the psychotics. Always. That is what we have to avoid within ourselves”
15. “One discovers the future in the past, and both are part of a whole”
16. “You win back your consciousness of your inner being when you recognise the universe as a coherent whole”
17. “Morality! Social goals! These were myths to put beside belief in an upward movement of evolution”
18. “Ignorance has its advantages. A universe of surprises is what I pray for!”
19. “There are things one can know, given an awareness of the conditions. Actions can be predicted”
20. “Some actions have an end but no beginning; some begin but do not end. It all depends on where the observer is standing”
21. “Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past. Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-perpetuating upon itself - a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred”
22. “The most dangerous of all creations is a rigid code of ethics. It will turn on you and drive you into exile!”
23. “A large populace held in check by a small but powerful force is quite a common situation in our universe. And we know the major conditions wherein this large populace may turn upon its keepers - One: When they find a leader. This is the most volatile threat to the powerful; they must retain control of leaders. Two: When the populace recognizes its chains. Keep the populace blind and unquestioning. 'Three: When the populace perceives a hope of escape from bondage. They must never even believe that escape is possible!”
24. “A ruler need not be a prophet. Nor even godlike. A ruler need only be sensitive”
25. “The past may show the right way to behave if you live in the past, but circumstances change”
26. “You can work your own muscles, exercise them, strengthen them, but the mind acts of itself Sometimes, when you have learned this about the mind, it shows you things you do not want to see”
27. “The assumption that humans exist within an essentially impermanent universe, taken as an operational precept, demands that the intellect become a totally aware balancing instrument, But the intellect cannot react thus without involving the entire organism, Such an organism may be recognized by its burning, driving behavior. And thus it is with a society treated as organism. But here we encounter an old inertia. Societies move to the goading of ancient, reactive impulses. They demand permanence. Any attempt to display the universe of impermanence arouses rejection patterns, fear, anger, and despair, Then how do we explain the acceptance of prescience? Simply: the giver of prescient visions, because he speaks of an absolute (permanent) realization, may be greeted with joy by humankind even while predicting the most dire events”
28. “Precise thinking contained undigested absolutes. Nature was not precise”
29.  “All proofs inevitably lead to propositions which have no proof! All things are known because we want to believe in them”
30. “This is the fallacy of power: ultimately it is effective only in an absolute, a limited universe. But the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change. Any power must always meet a greater power”
31. “When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles, when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles”
32. “What a simple step it was, the step from one danger into another!”
33. “You do, indeed, build your own myths, but so do all societies. You I must warn, however. You are behaving as so many other misguided scientists have behaved. Your actions reveal that you wish to take something out of (away from] life. It is time you were reminded of that which you so often profess: One cannot have a single thing without its opposite”
34. “If you focus your awareness only upon your own rightness, then you invite the forces of opposition to overwhelm you”
35. “One uses power by grasping it lightly. To grasp too strongly is to be taken over by power, and thus to become its victim”
36. “The universe is just there; that's the only way a Fedaykin can view it and remain the master of his senses. The universe neither threatens nor promises. It holds things beyond our sway: the fall of a meteor, the eruption of a spiceblow, growing old and dying. These are the realities of this universe and they must be faced regardless of how you feel about them. You cannot fend off such realities with words. They will come at you in their own wordless way and then, then you will understand what is meant by life and death. Understanding this, you will be filled with joy”
37. “Irony often masks the inability to think beyond one’s assumptions”
38. “Most lives are a flight from selfhood. Most prefer the truths of the stable. You stick your heads into the stanchions and munch contentedly until you die. Others use you for their purposes. Not once do you live outside the stable to lift your head and be your own creature”
39. “Abandon certainty! That's life's deepest command. That's what life's all about. We're a probe into the unknown, into the uncertain. If certainty is knowing absolutely an absolute future, then that's only death disguised! Such a future becomes now”
40. ""I'm going to rub your faces in things you try to avoid. I don't find it strange that all you want to believe is only that which comforts you. How else do humans invent the traps which betray us into mediocrity? How else do we define cowardice?""
41. “The one-eyed view of our universe says you must not look far afield for problems. Such problems may never arrive. Instead, tend to the wolf within your fences. The packs ranging outside may not even exist”
42. “The gift of words is the gift of deception and illusion”
43. “Knowing was a barrier which prevented learning”
44. “Knowledge, you see, has no use without purpose, but purpose is what builds enclosing walls”
45. “If you believe certain words, you believe their hidden arguments. When you believe something is right or wrong, true or false, you believe the assumptions in the words which express the arguments. Such assumptions are often full of holes, but remain most precious to the convinced”
46. “That which you know in one world, you shall not find in another”
47. “Because of the one-pointed time awareness in which the conventional mind remains immersed, humans tend to think of everything in a sequential, word-oriented framework. This mental trap produces very short-term concepts of effectiveness and consequences, a condition of constant, unplanned response to crises”
48. “To learn patience in the Bene Gesserit Way, you must begin by recognizing the essential, raw instability of our universe we call nature - meaning this totality in all of its manifestations - the Ultimate Non-Absolute. This is the perspective which you create with your own belief, and beliefs can be manipulated by imagination. You've learned only a limited way of looking at the universe. Now you must make the universe your own creation. This will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses, to whatever uses you are capable of imagining""
49. “Time is a measure of space, just as a range finder is a measure of space,  but measuring locks us into the place we measure”
50. “We must negate the machines that think. Humans must set their own guidelines. This is not something machines can do. Reasoning depends upon programming, not on hardware, and we are the ultimate program!""
51. “There's no single set of limits for all men. Universal prescience is an empty myth. Only the most powerful local currents of Time may be foretold. But in an infinite universe, local can be so gigantic that your mind shrinks from it""
52. “You are a child seeking to be a man. When you are a man, you will seek in vain for the child you were”
53. “Every judgment teeters on the brink of error. To claim absolute knowledge is to become monstrous. Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty”
54. “There's no mystery about a human life. It's not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced”
55. “I've not only showed you my faith, I've made you conscious of your own existence. Life requires dispute. You've been made to know - by me! - that your reality differs from all others; thus, you know you're alive”
56. “Irreverence is a most necessary ingredient of religion. Not to speak of its importance in philosophy. Irreverence is the only way left to us for testing our universe”
57. “My mind controls my reality!”
58. “Now you’re truly an infant. Before… you were only a potential, not even born”
59. “Humankind periodically goes through a speedup of its affairs. thereby experiencing the race between the renewable vitality of the living and the beckoning vitiation of decadence. In this periodic race, any pause becomes luxury. Only then can one reflect that all is permitted; all is possible”
60. “Ahhhh, my memories, I have seen your illusion. You no longer invent the next moment for me. You merely show me how to create new moments. I'll not lock myself on the old tracks”
61. “This is a changing universe and we are the strangest change of all. We resonate to many influences. Our futures need constant updating. Now, there's a barrier which we must remove. This requires that we do brutal things, that we go against our most basic, our dearest wishes.... But it must be done”
62. “Natural selection has been described as an environment selectively screening for those who will have progeny. Where humans are concerned, though, this is an extremely limiting viewpoint. Reproduction by sex tends toward experiment and innovation. It raises many questions, including the ancient one about whether environment is a selective agent after the variation occurs, or whether environment plays a pre-selective role in determining the variations which it screens”
63. “Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child. Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always the ultimate unspoken commandment is ""Thou shalt not question!"". But we question. We break that commandment as a matter of course. The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind's deepest sense of creativity”
64. “Peace demands solutions, but we never reach living solutions; we only work toward them. A fixed solution is, by definition, a dead solution. The trouble with peace is that it tends to punish mistakes instead of rewarding brilliance”
65. “The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires. Thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas. We possess only this moment in which to dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence which we share and create” 
66. “Men roust want to do things out of their own innermost drives. People, not commercial organizations or chains of command, are what make great civilizations work. Every civilization depends upon the quality of the individuals it produces. If you over-organize humans, over-legalize them, suppress their urge to greatness - they cannot work and their civilization collapses”
67. “Seen from a distance, only the patterns lay revealed and those patterns tempted one to belief in absolutes. In absolutes, we may lose our way. The patterns could guide and they could trap. One had to remember that patterns change”
68. “The surest way to keep a secret is to make people believe they already know the answer. People don't ask questions then”
69. “As animals must move across the land, their existence dependent upon that movement, the soul of humankind, blocked for eons, needed a track upon which it could move”
70. “One condition was the mirror of the other”
71. “Anyone can be a Truthsayer, even you. It's a matter of self-honesty about the nature of your own feelings. It requires that you have an inner agreement with truth which allows ready recognition”
72. “He had achieved harmony simply by accepting it”
73. “To be a god can ultimately become boring and degrading. There'd be reason enough for the invention of free will!”
74. “How easy it is to follow our thoughts instead of our senses”
75. “Let the future happen of itself. The only rule governing creativity is the act of creation itself”
76. “The assumption that a whole system can be made to work better through an assault on its conscious elements betrays a dangerous ignorance. This has often been the ignorant approach of those who call themselves scientists and technologists”
77. “There's always a prevailing mystique in any civilisation. It builds itself as a barrier against change, and that always leaves future generations unprepared for the universe's treachery”
78. “Each day, each moment brings its change. One learns by recognizing the moments”"
Neptune 4 Plus- Massive B to level before prints,elegoo,1i9tegr,2025-01-25 13:26:46,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/elegoo/comments/1i9tegr/neptune_4_plus_massive_b_to_level_before_prints/,Due_Lengthiness_2457,Discussion,"So I finally have my Neptune 4 Plus set up, I have the bed clickers installed, I have a magnetic plate aligner added.   I spent lots of time trying to bypass future problems right.  
  
I've done a few prints, and I'm impressed with the speed- the prints came out pretty good also.

My frustration is the inital leveling each time I print, which takes hugely more time than any other printer I've used.  
The machine boots up very slow which is fine, and I immediately go into ""Level"" before every print- being forever afraid of the Blob of Death right.

So it goes promptly to a screen that shows you the Z offset, and says you need to make sure with a piece of paper.   Well thats a nice feature.

And of course I do.  I test.  Able to pull, not able to push.   I fuss with Z up and down until I am just dragging the paper back, and it bunches up pushing forward.   Good enough.  
I click ""SAVE and Restart to apply leveling data"".  
The motor shuts off, comes back on.   Then NEPTUNE does its ""get ready"", moves the head around, and comes back to the home position.  
Now its no longer perfect, its a little bit high!  
Okay.

So I adjust Z down again.   This time I don't save, but go right to Calibrate.  
It does its 36 positions, I wait through all that and it comes back to start.  
It seems like its now still in the correct spot.

So I click SAVE.  Motor off, back on, back to home.  
I start the print.

It comes off the bed on one end.  
Its not level!!!

I stop the print, and it goes back to home.  
Z is at the right height (measure with paper)

I run Calibration again.   Sit through all the 36 measurements, all over again.  
I don't SAVE this time, I just back out and start printing.  
IT FINALLY PRINTS LEVEL

Aaaaughhh!  
I mean I appreciate the faster printing but  by the time you spend all morning calibrating..........

It also makes weird buzzing noises now and then when it prints, like a squeaking piece of furniture on the floor.  
Is anybody else having these problems, and if not what version of Firmware are you using."

So I know TOF is so niche, some docs are fascinated by it and want to hear my murmur haha..

I had an initial repair, by a surgeon who must have been incredible. Then finally I received a pulm. valve in college. That was about 12 years ago now.

I recently got a cardiac MRI, and from a layperson the numbers look pretty good. The strange thing is you can see my pulmonary flow is Definity imbalanced, however my doc said that could be due to my past surgery / body adapting because my cardiac anatomy is very different than normal hearts. He is gonna schedule a follow up test to make sure of that.

I am asymptomatic, play sports, run etc. I played sports my entire life, and live in NYC so im always on the move. I realize that things can go wrong as I get older, but looking at this MRI I feel pretty damn lucky about this. How does this MRI look from your perspective, consider I have a congenital heart disorder? Doctors are miracle workers and the surgeons are incredible at this.

Trading Stocks Based on Market Momentum: Strategies for Success
---------------------------------------------------------------

Trading stocks based on market momentum can be a powerful strategy for investors seeking to optimize their returns. Momentum trading hinges on the idea that stocks which have performed well in the recent past are likely to continue performing well in the near future. Conversely, those that have underperformed are expected to continue their downward trend. Implementing this strategy involves a few essential principles that every investor should understand.

### Understanding Market Momentum

Market momentum reflects the velocity of price movements. In simple terms, when the price of a stock moves sharply upwards, it is said to have positive momentum. Conversely, a stock trending downwards exhibits negative momentum. Recognizing these trends allows you to identify profitable trading opportunities.

### Key Indicators to Analyze

For effective momentum trading, utilize the following indicators:

- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** This measures the speed and change of price movements. An RSI above 70 indicates that a stock may be overbought (positive momentum), while below 30 suggests it may be oversold (negative momentum).
- **Moving Averages:** The 50-day and 200-day moving averages help smooth out price data to highlight longer-term trends. A stock crossing above its moving average can signal strong momentum.
- **Volume Analysis:** Increased trading volume often accompanies price changes, confirming momentum. A price rise along with higher volume suggests strength in the move.

### Developing Your Trading Strategy

Your approach to trading stocks should be structured yet flexible. Here are steps to help you create an effective momentum-based trading strategy:

1. **Screen for Potential Stocks:** Use stock screening tools to filter stocks that have demonstrated significant price movements over a defined time frame, such as the last three or six months.
2. **Analyze Indicator Signals:** After identifying stocks, apply your technical indicators (like RSI and moving averages) to assess whether the stock is in a strong uptrend or downtrend.
3. **Set Entry and Exit Points:** Plan your entry point, ideally when the stock shows strong momentum. Determine exit points based on profit targets or stop-loss levels to manage your risk.

### The Role of Risk Management

No trading strategy is complete without a solid risk management plan. It’s crucial to protect your capital while trading stocks based on market momentum. Here are important practices:

- **Diversification:** Spread your investments across different stocks or sectors to minimize the impact of a downturn in any single stock.
- **Limit Orders:** Use limit orders to control the price at which your trades execute, helping you avoid unfavorable price movements.
- **Position Sizing:** Determine how much of your total capital you are willing to risk on a single trade. This helps manage potential losses without jeopardizing your entire portfolio.

### Monitoring Market News and Events

Market sentiment can impact momentum significantly. Stay updated on news related to the stocks you are trading. Earnings announcements, partnerships, and macroeconomic news can either bolster or hinder momentum. Always consider how external factors may influence the prices of the stocks you are assessing.

### The Importance of Patience

Momentum trading requires both skill and patience. It’s essential to avoid reacting impulsively to every price movement. Sometimes, taking a step back can provide clarity. Trust your analysis and the strategies you’ve put in place.

The principles of trading stocks based on market momentum into your investment strategy can significantly enhance your potential for success. By understanding the indicators, developing a solid strategy, practicing sound risk management, staying informed, and maintaining patience, you set yourself up for a rewarding trading experience. As always, consider starting small and gradually scaling up your trades as you gain more confidence and understanding in this trading approach.

Understanding How Market Trends Influence Stock Trading Decisions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding market trends is essential for anyone looking to trade stocks. Investors often seek patterns to guide their trading decisions. Market trends provide insights into where prices may move in the future. By focusing on these trends, you can make more informed choices in your stock trading strategy.

### What Are Market Trends?

Market trends are the general direction in which prices move over a certain period. These trends can be classified into three main categories:

- **Uptrends:** Characterized by rising prices, indicating increasing investor confidence.
- **Downtrends:** Marked by falling prices, suggesting that investors may be losing confidence.
- **Sideways Trends:** Occur when prices move within a range, indicating market indecision.

Each of these trends can significantly impact your trading decisions, helping you determine when to buy or sell stocks based on market momentum.

### The Role of Momentum in Trading

Momentum refers to the tendency of a stock's price to continue moving in the same direction. This principle can be easy to understand. If a stock has been increasing in price, it may continue to do so for a period due to investor enthusiasm. Conversely, if it has been declining, it may keep falling as others sell off their shares.

Traders often look for stocks with strong momentum to capitalize on quick price movements. Here are some strategies to consider:

- **Identify key indicators:** Use momentum indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) or the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge strength.
- **Follow volume changes:** Increasing trading volume can confirm a price trend. If stock prices rise with higher volume, it often indicates strong buying interest.
- **Set clear entry and exit points:** Define your entry and exit strategies before making trades. This helps you avoid emotional decision-making.

### How Trends Influence Your Trading Decisions

Market trends not only impact individual stocks but also influence overall trading strategies. Understanding how to read these trends can enhance your trading effectiveness significantly. Here’s how you can use trends to your advantage:

- **Trend following:** Many traders use trend-following strategies, buying stocks in an uptrend and selling those in a downtrend. This method can be effective during strong market movements.
- **Pivot points:** Identifying pivot points—where price trends may reverse—can offer excellent buying or selling opportunities.
- **Market sentiment:** Pay attention to the news and market sentiment. A positive outlook on the economy can boost momentum, while negative news can quickly change a trend.

### Managing Risk with Trend Analysis

Trading based on momentum and market trends carries risks. Here are some ways to manage these risks effectively:

- **Stop-loss orders:** Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Setting a stop-loss order helps protect your investment if a trend suddenly reverses.
- **Diversification:** Spread your investments across different sectors or asset classes. This reduces risk, as not all assets will be impacted by market trends in the same way.
- **Stay updated:** Regularly review market conditions and adjust your trading strategies accordingly. Being proactive can help you react swiftly to unexpected changes.

Understanding market trends and their influence on stock movements is crucial for traders. By focusing on momentum and analyzing key indicators, you can make more informed trading decisions. Just remember to manage your risks, stay disciplined, and keep learning as you go. Trading stocks based on market momentum can be rewarding when approached with the right knowledge and strategies.

### Conclusion

Trading stocks based on market momentum can be a game-changer for many investors. By mastering the art of recognizing trends and their influence on stock prices, you can make informed trading decisions that maximize your potential for profit. Embracing strategies such as identifying momentum stocks, utilizing technical indicators, and understanding the psychology behind market movements are all keys to unlocking the power of momentum trading.

It's important to keep a close eye on the broader market trends and the factors that drive them, including economic news, earnings reports, and geopolitical events. By staying updated on these influences, you can adapt your trading approach and improve your timing in the market. Remember, successful trading is not just about making quick gains; it’s about developing a strategy that works for you over the long run.

Engaging with other traders, studying market patterns, and continuously honing your skills will only enhance your ability to trade stocks based on market momentum effectively. While the stock market can sometimes be unpredictable, those who understand and leverage momentum can turn challenges into opportunities. Embrace the insights shared in this article to navigate your trading journey with confidence. You have the tools and knowledge to succeed, so start applying them and watch your trading efforts thrive.

XRP, created by Ripple Labs, is one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the financial space. It is designed to solve issues related to cross-border payments and financial transactions—specifically the inefficiencies and high costs of traditional international remittances.

Current and Future Use Cases:
	•	Cross-Border Payments: XRP’s primary use case is to facilitate cross-border payments. Traditional international money transfers (via banks or remittance services) are slow, costly, and inefficient. Ripple uses XRP to allow for near-instant and low-cost transactions between banks and financial institutions across borders. RippleNet is already being used by major financial institutions and banks globally, such as Santander, PNC, and Standard Chartered.
	•	Liquidity and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Ripple’s ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) service uses XRP as a bridge currency to facilitate instant payments between different fiat currencies. For example, an individual or business can send USD to a recipient in Mexico, where XRP is used to convert the USD into Mexican Pesos instantly and at a low cost. This can save banks and financial institutions millions in liquidity costs.
	•	Smart Contracts and Enterprise Solutions: Ripple has also been exploring smart contracts to enhance its payment solutions, potentially enabling programmable money and more efficient, automated financial transactions.
	•	Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Ripple is working on CBDC projects, collaborating with governments to integrate XRP into central bank digital currencies. This could be a significant long-term use case for XRP, as governments around the world explore creating their own digital currencies.

Technological Development:
	•	RippleNet and Ripple’s Network: RippleNet, Ripple’s global network, connects financial institutions and enables fast, low-cost international transfers. Over 300+ financial institutions are already part of the network, and this number is expected to grow as adoption of blockchain-based payment systems increases.
	•	Regulatory Challenges: Ripple has faced regulatory challenges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has raised concerns about whether XRP is a security. However, Ripple has continued to fight the SEC’s lawsuit, and a favorable resolution for Ripple could unlock even greater growth and adoption.
	•	Expansion into New Markets: As the global financial landscape continues to shift towards digital solutions, Ripple’s XRP is well-positioned to play a key role in the future of digital payments, especially as traditional banking infrastructure adopts more efficient blockchain solutions.

Potential Synergies Between Jasmy and XRP:

Though Jasmy and XRP serve different primary functions (data management for Jasmy and payments for XRP), there are potential synergies between the two technologies:
	•	Decentralized Payments in IoT: Jasmy’s IoT devices could use XRP for instant micropayments or for transferring value when interacting with different connected devices. For instance, Jasmy could enable a system where IoT devices like smart cars or smart homes could use XRP for transactional exchanges (e.g., paying for energy, services, or data usage in real-time).
	•	Cross-Border Data and Payment Solutions: If Jasmy gains traction in international markets, XRP could facilitate cross-border payments related to the IoT data economy. For example, data shared via Jasmy’s platform could have associated value, and XRP could be used to handle transactions across borders with minimal fees.
	•	Blockchain Integration: Both projects use blockchain technology to create decentralized ecosystems, and as both ecosystems mature, there could be future integrations or collaborations to support global decentralized data and payment solutions.

Conclusion:

Both Jasmy and XRP have distinct but potentially complementary roles in the future of blockchain adoption. Jasmy focuses on decentralizing data ownership and empowering individuals in the IoT space, while XRP is revolutionizing cross-border payments and financial transactions.

As blockchain adoption expands in both the IoT and financial sectors, there’s potential for these two projects to complement each other, particularly as the global digital economy grows and requires efficient solutions for data management and value transfer.

    ---
    
    ## 8. Troubleshooting Common Errors
    
    Here are some frequent messages users encounter:
    
    1. **Expression.Error: The Column X of the table was not found.**  
       - **Cause**: Mismatch between the column name in your step and the actual data.  
       - **Fix**: Double-check spelling and query steps to ensure the column exists.
    
    2. **DataFormat.Error: We couldn't parse the input provided as a Date value.**  
       - **Cause**: A non-date value or inconsistent date format.  
       - **Fix**: Convert the column to text first, clean invalid entries, then convert to date again.
    
    3. **Formula.Firewall: Query 'X' (Step 'Y') references other queries or steps, so it may not directly access a data source.**  
       - **Cause**: Privacy levels or data source settings are blocking certain transformations.  
       - **Fix**: Adjust privacy levels in **Data Source Settings** or use the **Combine** feature within a single data source context.
    
    4. **DataFormat.Error: We couldn't parse the input provided as a Number value.**  
       - **Cause**: Non-numeric characters or inconsistent decimal separators.  
       - **Fix**: Strip or correct invalid characters (e.g., commas in numeric values). Convert to number once cleaned.
    
    5. **Expression.Error: The key didn't match any rows in the table.**  
       - **Cause**: Merge or join steps referencing a key that doesn’t exist in one dataset.  
       - **Fix**: Confirm that the join column exists in both queries and that there are matching records.
    
    6. **File Not Found Error**  
       - **Cause**: Incorrect file path or filename used in the **Source** step.  
       - **Fix**: Verify the file path, name, and ensure the file is accessible from the specified location.
    
    ---
    
    ## 9. Final Note
    
    - **Focus on Data Accuracy**: Power Query can handle a variety of data sources, but careful setup ensures results remain trustworthy.  
    - **Keep It Modular**: Reference queries help maintain a clean, logical flow of transformations.  
    - **Encourage Exploration**: Experiment with different merges, filters, and function options to see how each affects the dataset.

HRM Pro producing erroneous data 1 year after purchase and battery change,Garmin,1i9rrlg,2025-01-25 12:15:49,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9rrlg,Lost_And_NotFound,Accessories / Companion Device,"My HRM Pro has started producing some really weird data in the last month which is about one year since I bought it. 

When I’m doing really casual recovery runs it has my heart rate reaching 160 bpm despite basically walking but if I switch it off the watch is measuring a much more realistic bpm.

My threshold efforts and races have the opposite effect with it hardly recognising that I’m working hard and am absolutely gassed.

Feels like it just wants to read a ~150 bpm heart rate regardless of what I’m doing but it does still go up and down and is normal if I’m just at complete rest.

I’ve tried everything to get it working properly again. Changed battery, cleaned, dried electrics, wetted electrodes, worn with under layers on top and not.

Any suggestions to get it working again / re-calibrate the readings or is it just done for and time to buy a Polar H10?"
2003 Finals Defensive Tracking: Unicorn Kidd,nbadiscussion,1i9rkcr,2025-01-25 12:07:13,22,0.96,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i9rkcr/2003_finals_defensive_tracking_unicorn_kidd/,hshin420,,"**Disclaimer**: Since most of you guys are unfamiliar with this tracking system I'm going to start by defining/explaining everything being counted.

# What's being tracked

**Paint-Defense:**

>. A lot of ink has been spilled arguing for it as the singularly most important component of an individual defender’s ability to help his team prevent the other guys from scoring. It’s also an aspect of the game that is poorly quantified, especially pre-data ball. Blocks are by and large the primary measure people use, but a look at usage (**rim-load**, measured by **PPs (Primary Protections))** reveals that even players who offer very little rim-protection can be made to look like centerpieces if one limits their evaluation to counting how often contact is made with the ball:

>**EPP - Effective primary protections -** This is when a PP is deemed effective  
**IPP - Ineffective Primary Protections -** This is when a PP is deemed ineffective

**Perimeter Defense:**

>**PPDs** \- Primary Perimeter defendings - This credits a player as the primary or co-primary perimeter defender for a possession  
  
**EPPD** \- Effective Primary Perimeter defendings - When a PPD is deemed effective  
**IPPD** \- Ineffective Primary Perimeter defendings - When a PPD is deemed ineffective

**General Deterrence**

>That said, I think rim-load has a glaring blind-spot. What if the reason a player is used as a paint-protector…because the opponent wants them to be used as one?  
  
Corzine and Oakley both were the primary or co-primary paint protectors on a boatload of possessions above. But is Corzine’s relativity to Oakley there the Bull’s doing, or their own? Jokic spends alot of time defending the paint, even compared to other bigs. Is he a great rim-protector? Or is he just being hunted by opposing offenses?  
  
To answer these queries, I present the latest product of Eye-Test, Inc:  
  
**Irrational Avoidances (IA).**  
  
The following conditions must be met to rack up an Irrational Avoidance…  
  
1) More of your team’s defenders are on the opposing side of the floor for a sequence (There can be multiple sequences per possession)  
2) Despite this the attacker/attacking team chooses to attack the side with more defenders  
3) This decision is made after a reset or in the half-court/semi-transition  
  
Note, “the floor” here really describes the area of space a set of defenders covers, not the literal floor. Additionally the sides are determined using the vantage point of the initial ball-handler. If you can imagine a symmetric line being drawn from the ball-handler’s POV to the basket…being to the left or right of said line determines what side you’re on. I will also exclusively look at how a sequence starts.  
  
A “sequence” ends whenever there is a pause in the ball-handlers movement or the possession finishes.

# Intro

Guards generally struggle to showcase significant defensive impact. Even the ones racking up blocks and steals and DPOYs:

>*Jordan*  
**88-98**  
\+1.1 drtg difference  
**90-99**  
\+0.2 drtg difference  
**85-98**  
\-1.1 drtg difference  
**84-99**  
\-.5 drtg difference

>*Wade*  
**2004-2014**  
\-.1 drtg difference  
**2006-2011**  
\-.3 drtg difference  
**2005-2016**  
\-.4 drtg difference

“Generally” because there’s at least one exception:

>*Jason Kidd*  
**1997-2001**  
\-3.6 drtg differrence  
**2002-2008**  
\-6.8 drtg difference  
**2008-2012**  
\-.1 drtg difference

Why is Kidd’s data so good? He barely collects blocks and he gets steals at a lower clip than the first two. Well, a hypothesis was presented in the ongoing retro player of the year project:

>Finally there’s Kidd. The best ever defensive guard? 204. 6’4, **He’s strong and stout which means when attackers are thinking of driving he spooks them alot more often than a jumpy shotblocker like Jordan or Wade.** He’s a mini-duncan in a way. On time, at the right place at the right time in the right way. He just knows where he needs to be and why he needs to be there. And he knos where the others need to be and makes sure they get there too.

Jason Kidd, 6’4, averaging 0.3 blocks a game is a better paint-protector than taller, if lankier, block accumulators? He weighs more so “strong and stout” makes sense but thus far no guard has even crossed 4 per 40-possession in any of the tracking with the most PPs for a tracked game coming to Jordan in 1988 vs the Knicks when he recorded 3 (the record is 5 by 6’8 Reid in the 86 finals if one considers him an SG)

Blocks don’t seem to [correlate that strongly with usage thus far](https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=2421706):  
  
But height does. Is Kidd’s stoutness and strength really enough here?  
  
To start to answer this we’ll look at the film. Specifically the first 40 possessions of game 6 of the 2003 Finals where Kidd anchored his team within 2 games of an inaugural nba championship. Fwiw, in the game tracked, Kidd recorded 1 steal, 2 defensive rebounds, and 0 blocks:

This can get subjective so any peer-review is welcomed (I've posted time-stamps)

# Tracking

**Possession 1** \- 1:48  
  
Game footage freezes at 1:54 but it seems Kidd is just watching his man by the sideline  
  
**Possession 2** \- 2:09  
  
Pretty much the same as 1.  
  
**Possession 3** \- 2:28  
  
~~Kidd~~Slay is one of two defenders to start the possession in the paint and then holds off Duncan on an island with no one behind for several seconds. ~~Kidd~~ Slay then swipes at a driving Bowen without fouling or stripping, does the bulk of the work preventing Duncan from challenging for a rebound, challenges Robinson. He’s also the defender closest to the basket on the inbound.  
  
~~(Kidd - 1 PP, 1 EPP, 1 PPD, 1 EPPD)~~  
  
**Possession 4** \- 3:40  
  
Kidd picks up Parker and tries to funnel him into a sea of defenders. Doesn’t work out but doesn’t look like a blowby.  
  
(Kidd - 1 PPD)  
  
**Possession 5** \- 4:21  
  
Kenyon Martin is the primary.  
  
**Possession 6** \- 5:10  
  
Rotates too late to help.  
  
**Possession 7** \- 6:00  
  
Moves to help on the post up.

Hangs at the elbow and the possession ends early.  
  
**Possession 10** \- 7:40  
  
Hangs at the elbow.  
  
**Possession 11** \- 8:20  
  
Deters an inside pass from manu, stays with manu a bit pressuring him to pass it off, seals a man to help with the rebound. He can get pro-primary perimeter credit here.  
  
(Kidd - 2 PPD, 1 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 12** \- 9:20  
  
Tracks Manu for a bit, spends a little time under the basket.  
  
**Possession 13** \- 9:29  
  
Hanging around.  
  
**Possession 14** \- 10:12  
  
Tracks a man off-ball.  
  
**Possession 15** \- 11:30  
  
Chases Stephen Jackson on the fastbreak and runs into Manu fouling him. Doesn’t seem like Manu was in great position to score regardless.  
  
(Kidd - 3 PPD, 1 IPPD)  
  
**Possession 16** \- 12:45  
  
Picks up Tony Parker, gets caught on a screen from Duncan, contests late.  
  
(Kidd - 4 PPD, 2 IPPD)  
  
**Possession 17** \- 13:10  
  
Kidd gets his first IA (1) with Parker using a screen to go on the more crowded side of the court. Kidd fights around it to stay attached and Parker passes it off. Kidd is about to catch the ball off a miss but his teammate tips it to Duncan who fires right as Kidd enters his vicinity.  
  
(Kidd - 5 PPD, 2 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 18** \- 14:35  
  
Kidd tracks a very active Parker off-ball, helps on Duncan who throws it to Manu who throws it to Jackson as Kidd moves towards him. Then Kidd contests Jackson well and Jackson misses.  
  
(Kidd - 6 PPD, 3 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 19** \- 15:20  
  
Kidd tracks his man.  
  
**Possession 20** \- 17:00  
  
Rockets turnover with Hakeem up the court. Waves his hands to try and stop a long lob but the ball finds its recipient and Houston loses the 2 v 1.  
  
**Possession 21** \- 18:30  
  
Spurs fastbreak turns into free throws and then a technical free-throw  
  
(Kidd goes out)  
(Kidd comes back at 29:01)  
  
**Possession 22** \- 29:01  
  
Kidd fronts on the inbounder near the basket and rotates to try and stop Johnson from backdooring. Inbound is way off.  
  
(Kidd - 7 PPD, 4 EPPD, 1 PP)  
  
**Possession 23** \- 29:55  
  
Kidd gets his 2nd IA (2) with the ball-handler swinging it to the more crowded side. Hangs at the edge of the paint the whole possession.  
  
**Possession 24** \- 30:29  
  
Kidd spends the most time near the basket and rotates to meet Robinson strong-side, buying enough time for Williams to knock it away.  
  
(Kidd - 2 PPD, 1 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 25** \- 31:07  
  
Kidd hangs by the paint.  
  
**Possession 26** \- 31:14  
  
Kidd watches as San Antonio quickly squanders an extra possession.  
  
**Possession 27** \- 31:52  
  
Kidd rotates near the basket where he is –technically– the last line of defense for the most critical part of the possession. I say technically because he backs away on Duncan’s second go at the basket and Duncan gets both the bucket and free-throws.  
  
(Kidd - 3 PP, 1 IPP)  
  
**Possession 28** \- 33:50  
  
Kidd comes up to meet Jackson with the ball. Jackson passes off but there’s a foul. Kidd is closest to the inbounder and picks him up when he gets the ball back. Kidd follows him when he gives it to Duncan preventing a give and go and then helps as Duncan spins on the post. Duncan kicks it out to Bowen who converts the wide open jumper.  
  
(Kidd - 8 PPD, 5 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 29** \- 35:05  
  
Kidd spends a few seconds near the basket and catches the ball when Martin strips Duncan.  
  
**Possession 30** \- 36:20  
  
Kidd inches towards Robinson as he drives to “help” but Robinson just goes right by him and scores on two defenders.  
  
**Possession 31** \- 36:54  
  
Kidd starts the possession as the backline defender and then comes out to the perimeter to contain Manu then shuffles back near the basket for a potential rebound that never comes.  
  
**Possession 32** \- 38:14  
  
Kidd comes to intercept a driving Parker. Parker passes it to Manu who Kidd bumps forcing Manu to take the long way around to the basket giving Martin the opportunity to swallow him.  
  
(Kidd - 9 PPD, 6 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 33** \- 39:45  
  
Kidd comes to intercept Parker as he rebounds, bumping him. Parker dusts Kidd and throws it to Duncan who Kidd then watches force the ball in on the post.  
  
(Kidd - 10 PPD, 3 IPPD)  
  
**Possession 34** \- 40:50  
  
Kidd watches from the corner as Duncan scores.  
  
**Possession 35** \- 41:11  
  
Kidd picks up Manu who passes it off.  
  
Possession **36** \- 42:05  
  
Kidd watches a man in the corner then comes inside to help intercept Parker who passes it off to Bowen. Kidd moves towards Bowen, who shot 40% from 3 all season, but is too late to do anything. Bowen misses.  
  
Possession **37** \- 43:26  
  
Kidd watches his man at the elbow.  
   
Possession **38** \- 43:50  
  
Kidd follows his man into the paint area where he stays to offer a little help on Duncan. Helplessly watches Robinson backdoor Collins.  
  
Possession **39** \- 44:20  
  
Kidd starts the possession watching a man on the corner before shuffling near the basket. Backs away as Robinson goes up and Williams fouls him.  
  
Possession **40** \- 45:10  
  
Kidd watches from the opposite edge of the paint as Collins misses. Kidd goes up for an uncontested rebound but his teammate gets it and gives it to Kidd.

# Tally and Analysis

**Paint Protection**:

>\-> 3 PPs  
\-> 1 EPPs  
\-> 1 IPPs  
\-> 2 IAs

**Perimeter Defense:**

>\-> 10 PPDs  
\-> 6 EPPDs  
\-> 3 IPPDs

During Kidd’s first 40 possessions, I gave him, **3** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **1** and ineffective in **1**. Kidd was also given **10** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in **6** and ineffective in **3**. Additionally Kidd was given **2** Irrational Avoidances. This means per possession, Kidd averaged, **0.075 PPs, 0.025 EPPs, 0.025 IPPs, 0.25 PPDs, 0.15 EPPDs, 0.075 IPPDs, and 0.05 IAs.**  
  
The only big all these inputs have been tracked for is **97 Hakeem** (Game 6, WCF). During Hakeem’s first 40 possessions of the 6th game of the 97 WCF, I gave him **27** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **13** and ineffective in **7**. Hakeem also was given **4** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in 3 and ineffective in **1**. Additionally Hakeem was given **4** Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Hakeem averaged, **0.675 PPs, 0.325 EPPs, 0.175 IPPs, 0.1 PPDs, 0.075 EPPDs, 0.025 IPPDs, and 0.1 IAs.**

The only wing all these inputs have been tracked for is **2007 Lebron** (Game 1, Finals). During Lebron’s first 40 possessions, I gave him, **5** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **3** and ineffective in **1**. Lebron also was given **16** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in **9** and ineffective in **3**. Additionally, Lebron was given **9** Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Lebron averaged, **0.125 PPs, 0.075 EPPs, 0.025 IPPs, 0.4 PPDs, 0.225 EPPDs, 0.075 IPPDs, and 0.225 IAs.**

  
The only other guards to have their PPs counted are Micheal Jordan, Sam Vinceint, and BJ Armstrong. Jordan tallied **3** PPs in the first 40 possessions of game 3 of the 1988 ECSF between New York and Chicago. Sam Vincient tallied **2**. Jordan tallied **1** PP in the first 40 possessions of the 4th game of the 1991 ECF. Armstrong also tallied **1**.  
  
For a comparison to wings(over the first 40 defensive possessions for their respective teams), Oakley, Pippen, and Grant tallied **13, 8, and 6** PPs respectively in the aforementioned 88 game. In the aforementioned 91 game, Pippen and Grant had **14 PPs** each. In the final game of the 94 ECSF between New York and Chicago, Oakley and Pippen tallied **15 PPs** and Grant tallied **7**. In the 86 Finals, Reid tallied **5.**  
  
For Bigs, Over 37 possessions Duncan(99 finals, game 1) averaged **.57 PPs, 0.16 EPPs, 0.11 IPPs, and 0.03 IAs.** Over 31 possessions Robinson(99 finals, game 1) averaged **0.58 PPs, 0.26 EPPs, 0.13 IPPs. 0.032 IAs.** Over 22 Possessions in the final game of the 94 ECSF vs Chicago, **Ewing had 13 PPs and 3 IAs giving him, per possession, .59 PPs and 1.4 IAs.**

  
Kidd , perhaps unsurprisingly, has much more perimeter usage than Olajuwon. On the other hand, Lebron does better than Kidd across-the-board with more effective usage on both the perimeter and interior, more positive usage on both the perimeter, and the interior, and less ineffective usage on both the perimeter and usage. I noted there were 2 other possessions I’d credit Kidd as the secondary paint-protector but there are at least three additional ones I’d count that for Lebron. He and Lebron are dwarfed by Hakeem in terms of paint-tracking. Kidd in paticularly is dwarfed by pretty much all the bigs and wings with the exception of Reid whose usage was mostly a result of something going wrong for the Rockets. Presuming this sample is representative, I am doutful an outlier-y paint-presencer is explaining anything on it’s own. I would say he spends a bunch of possessions near where the action is happening and it’s possible their is an unusual effect that would be captured if i tracked tertiary usage, but even then, Kidd seems mostly a non-factor when called upon. He was a true backline defender once on a rotation and while he seemed to almost become one momentarily three other times, him just backing away repeatedly in a position to theoretically help makes me skeptical that over a larger sample he would be emulating wings there. I also think 2 of the PPs were borderline but given what I counted for Jordan in 88 (2 possessions where he happened to be under the basket with the possession almost immediately ending) I think it would be inconsistent not to see him as at least a co-primary in terms of paint usage,

I would hope this is not a surprise…

but a low steal count didn’t predict low or ineffective usage with Kidd more frequently guarding or helping than anyone else on the team and doing so effectively. This all-or-nothing system might undersell Kidd since he spent a few possessions splitting usage on the perimeter with usage as tertiary paint deterrent. Roamers in general may be a bit disadvantaged with my approach and Kidd looks like one.

Still being a mini-pippen doesn’t really explain having much better signals than Pippen. Maybe something easily observable will emerge as the sample is (hopefully) added to/vetted to, but if the unusually strong *and consistent* correlation Kidd has with team defense is not merely noise, it may be more a matter of brain than brawn. Unfortunately I, and seemingly no one, has come up with a system to “track” defensive quarterbacking. I would also expect Kidd to benefit if “secondary” usage inputs were added.  
  
I'll finish by copy and pasting some caveats with IAs (irrational avoidances):

>**Mobile defenders render avoidance pointless**  
  
For an IA to occur, a player must decide to face more defenders rather than a particular defender. If the defender being avoided is excellent at covering ground, going tgrough a more crowded route may be less likely to offer you the avoidance you seek.  
  
**Good defensive teammates hurt**

>  
If you are wary of defenders on the side opposite to the player as well, is it worth shifting?  
  
It’s possible the ideal scenario for IA accumulation is one where a player isn’t timely or capable of help and is surrounded by terrible rim-protectors.

I'll share the tracking for the 94 ECSF next I think"

&nbsp;

Note: The length is continuing to increase along with the girth. At this point, I am at a very solid 13 in girth and it's fitting fairly snug, but not very snug.

## **Thoughts**

I've been busy the past couple weeks, which means I didn't make time to write an update. I'll give a double update in this post.

We switched to using the straight size 13 cylinder at the beginning of Week 12. The plan is to use each cylinder size for roughly 28 sessions, which is 14 days at 2x sessions a day. Since girth is a priority for me, support recommends actually moving forward a little bit faster than 28 sessions, which is what we did in this case. I used the straight 13 cylinder until Thursday night of Week 13 and moved up to the straight 14 cylinder.

With the straight 14 cylinder I am getting a small bit of edema/donut right beneath my glans, but nothing too crazy. In my experience, that will be less and less prevalent the more sessions that I do with it. If I need to stay at a cylinder size for longer, we will extend the amount of sessions with a cylinder. So far, the sessions with the straight 14 have been going well. It's only been a handful of sessions and my stretch length under vacuum is starting to catch up, and even exceeded once, the stretch length in the straight 13 cylinder.

My girth is definitely a very solid 13 at this point. I'm excited to see if the straight 14 cylinder can get me closer to a size 14 with the measuring tool. We'll find out over the course of a couple weeks.

Outside of that, nothing too exciting to report. It's mostly just truckin along and doing my daily sessions. Everything feels good overall.

Oh, and it looks like the PhalBack charts extend themselves for the days not included in the initial 13 week run. I was curious if I would have to stop posting the charts if they weren't going to show data anymore, but they do so that's pretty nice.

"CMV: Subreddits choosing to ban X links now, and the manner in which these bans are occurring, is just virtue signaling/internet slacktivism",changemyview,1i9rfnh,2025-01-25 12:01:45,0,0.42,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i9rfnh/cmv_subreddits_choosing_to_ban_x_links_now_and/,shonig225,Delta(s) from OP,"This post is not about trying to change my views on whether or not Elon Musk performed a Nazi salute or if he espouses Neo-Nazi views (it was, and he does in my opinion). However, the sharp response to the salute by Reddit choosing this as the moment to ban Twitter/X links rings really hollow, as Musk has done much more and much worse in spreading neo-Nazism that did not achieve the same level of anger sitewide by Reddit. I think the reason for this, and views that I think would be curious if people can change, are twofold:

1. The average individual has at best, a frank misconception of what a Nazi is vs. what a fascist is (which directly includes the involvement of antisemitic beliefs), or at worst, a desire to avoid confronting antisemitism and instead a desire to ""punch Nazis"" when it's most convenient
2. Subs that do not routinely use X/Twitter-related content engaged in bans, or subs did not fully embrace bans by being willing to include screenshots, thus not actually acquiring any successful measures of protest



Nazism vs Fascism

I hold the strong belief that people do not understand most political words mean when they use them, and by using these words incorrectly, they dilute their meaning. Yes, what Musk did on Monday was a Nazi salute, but Musk has been engaging in Nazi rhetoric (or at least white supremacist rhetoric) quite openly since buying Twitter. As some examples of this, Musk opey welcomed back to Twitter users who had engaged in Nazi rhetoric such as Kanye West and Nick Fuentes; he has compared George Soros to Magneto and described his organization as one that seeks ""nothing less than the destruction of western civilization""; and, perhaps most damningly, he actively engaged in Great Replacement conspiracy discussion in November 2023 as when a Jewish user criticized the fact that the phrase ""Hitler was right"" was trending on X in the aftermath of the events of October 7th, Musk agreed with another use that ""the actual truth"" of the situation was that Jews hate white people and attempt to flood America with ""hordes of minorities"", followed with multiple white pride/pro-white nationalist statements. Multiple companies then began withdrawing advertisements from X, including IBM and Disney. The iron was clearly hot at that time for the average user to also boycott the site, and yet it took another 14 months for him in him doing a Nazi salute for the average Redditor to change their tune. Why is this? In my opinion, it's because the average Redditor does not understand what a Nazi is, which is not just your run-of-the-mill fascist. A key component of Nazism is antisemitism, which can manifest itself in a variety of ways. One such common way is the Great Replacement theory, that Jews are trying to replace white people with themselves and other minorities. Musk has been blatantly fascist and blatantly antisemitic for quite some time as evidenced above. How come people didn't divest from X across subreddits when advertisers were doing so? Do they not realize the crucial role antisemitism plays in Nazism? Or worse, did the average person not care enough out of fears of defending Jewish people given the crisis in Gaza? Is the desire to protect those who are harmed by Nazis, or is the desire to feel better about yourself because you ""punched Nazis""? My money is on the latter.

Inconsistency Amongst Subreddits

I will condition this section based off the subs that I'm aware of/am a part of (though in general I lurk on Reddit more than anything else), and my understanding of the trend to ban X links started within sports subreddits and spread sitewide. I firmly believe that the majority of subs banning X/Twitter are currently hypocritical in their models of doing so. This is for two reasons: 1) Most subs doing so do not frequently have users posting X/Twitter related content to begin with, and thus saying that X is banned now is just an opportunity of slacktivism for Redditors to pat themselves on the shoulder that they took a stand against a Nazi or 2) Subs that are banning likns are not banning screenshots, and by not doing so, they are still encouraging people to traffic X/Twitter in order to find content for those subs. Rather than just talk out of my ass, I decided to perform a quick data analysis. I did so by searching “links” on Reddit and sorting by “Top” posts over the past week, pulling the first 32 subreddits that mentioned banning X/Twitter links. These 32 subs covered a variety of different topics, and had a mean subscriber base of 2.34 million Redditors (due to a wide range of users from 136K in r/startrekmemes to 14M in r/NBA which is further confirmed with a standard deviation of 327K, I also calculated the median number of subscribers, which was 916,662). Of these 32 subs, 28 voted on banning all X/Twitter links, 3 did not, and one (r/xmen) still has an ongoing poll that is leaning to banning links. Of these 28 subs, 5 banned multiple forms of social media (with two subs discussing widening the ban), and 8 (roughly 28.6%) banned all X/Twitter screenshots (r/xmen is also leaning to banning screenshots in their poll). Furthermore, in order to determine the frequency of Twitter content posted in these subs, I looked at the top 30 posts both of all time and of the past year in each of these subs, tallying when either a Twitter link or a screenshot of a tweet was posted. On average, subs had about 19% v. 17% Twitter-related content posts in their top 30 posts of all time v. the past year, 90% v. 91% of which were screenshots. I interpreted this data to mean that most of these subs already do not frequently receive X/Twitter links as posts, and when they do receive X/Twitter related content, it is in the form of screenshots. Therefore, this confirms my opinion that people are just wanting to ban X/Twitter links to pat themselves on the back and be proud of having the easiest political take of all time, being anti-Nazi, whilst not actually accomplishing anything meaningful. Likewise, that less than 30% of these subs enacting bans are willing to ban screenshots as well further demonstrates performative internet slacktivism, as they are still willing to engage with X/Twitter but not in a way that may make them seem bad in the eyes of the majority. I think this is best demonstrated by r/leopardsatemyface, who banned links and screenshots, and in their mod post about doing so, the top 3 comments are all about allowing the use of screenshots on the subreddit as that is the main source of content. This is the best demonstration of this hypocrisy to me, as these users want to say that they are fighting Nazism yet still want to engage with the content from the site they want to ban. This goes hand-in-hand with my first point, that people don’t want to actually protect those who could actually be harmed by Nazism, but instead want to show everyone how anti-Nazi they are. As another example, both r/BlackPeopleTwitter and r/WhitePeopleTwitter, while banning links, both refused to ban screenshots. Both subreddits had >90% of their top posts of both the past year and all time as screenshots from Twitter. Their refusal to ban screenshots rings hollow, as the reasoning for not banning screenshots on both sites was that sharing screenshots does not directly drive traffic to the site. However, when your content is overwhelmingly sharing screenshots from the site, you do directly encourage users to traffic it in order to find content worth sharing on your subreddit.  

Ultimately, I think that if these subreddits wanted to actually make a difference, they would ban all types of X/Twitter related content, and they would have posted links to charities supporting those who are going to be most affected by policy changes in this administration. "
How Operator exposes OpenAI's poker face,BalancedInvestor,1i9rd96,2025-01-25 11:59:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BalancedInvestor/comments/1i9rd96/how_operator_exposes_openais_poker_face/,Middleway44,,"You may be aware that OpenAI is working on a project called Operator that uses their GPT model to ""control your computer.""

Here is a good post by another redditor on his feedback:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i8jln3/i\_am\_among\_the\_first\_people\_to\_gain\_access\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i8jln3/i_am_among_the_first_people_to_gain_access_to/)

Preface: I have a bachelor's and master's in computer science from an ivy league institution (not bragging) and have worked as a software developer in tech and finance for many years. My opinion is based on my experience learning machine learning and applying them in a business context.

My take on the redditor's feedback?

It more or less proves that OpenAI is playing a poker face with their lack of progress in generative AI - namely transformer-based AI techniques.

Where do we begin?

I don't want to get into the technicals of generative AI as I am not an AI/ML researcher, but my understanding (perhaps simple) is that generative AI is based on processing large datasets, turning them into tokens, training transformer-based models with these tokens, and incorporating reinforcement learning with human feedback (i.e., prompting).

It has made significant progress in what I would call ""efficient encoding"" of publicly available data, largely from the Internet.

A ""virgin"" LLM model like ChatGPT will only respond to you based on information it has been trained on. This point cannot be emphasized enough as many mainstream users don't understand the implications of this.

First, it means it cannot provide you with information it hasn't been trained on. A lot of these ""AI tests"" like coding, math, and domain-specific (MCAT for medicine, LSAT for law) are not that impressive when you consider that it's just regurgitating information from Internet data on these topics.

Second, it also means these models can ""hallucinate."" On hallucination, it is a bad term coined by mainstream users as the models are not really ""hallucinating"" in the human sense. It is purely regurgitating bad information from Internet data on these topics.

Do you see the common thread between these two points?

""Generative AI"" is just regurgitating information from Internet data based on an efficiently encoded model.

That's AI in its current transformer-based state.

It's a very good knowledge database like Wikipedia (ideally the entirety of human knowledge), but it fundamentally has no reasoning or creativity in the human sense.

What has been marketed by Sam Altman and other tech influencers as ""AGI"" is nonsense.

If you believe AGI is simply efficient information encoding, sure go ahead and call it AGI.

But if you believe AGI / superintelligence must have reasoning and creativity, let's be honest and stop using the term AGI.

The Operator project clearly proves this point. The transformer-based engine is very good at performing single steps (like those that can be found on guides online), but fails at multi-step processes that are interconnected.

Why?

Simply because it has no reasoning ability to put step 1 + step 2 to arrive at the next logical step 3.

A common counterargument I hear is ""well, you just need to prompt it better.""

This is where we arrive at another major misunderstanding by mainstream users.

Prompting is based on the idea of ""reinforcing learning with human feedback."" I don't want to get into the details (I'm not even qualified), but my understanding is prompting basically updates the model by putting more ""weight"" into the data that matches what the prompt is suggesting.

Essentially, you are just removing (really deemphasizing) data that doesn't fit with the human prompts.

It's like telling a student that his idea about topic A using idea 1 is wrong and he should focus on using idea 2 to understand topic A.

What is the overall effect of this?

Well, that's just another form of data training.

OpenAI has realized this many years ago, as have any qualified AI/ML researcher, and have started generating new data, no doubt with the help of companies like ScaleAI, using experts in different domains of knowledge.

Does this have a limit?

Not really, as long as these experts are providing new accurate training data not available publicly.

But what is the point?

Well yea, you will expand your model's knowledge database.

But the fundamental promise of what Sam Altman is hiding under the rug is generative AI in its current state has no reasoning or creativity and is nowhere near the AGI capabilities he is promising to the undereducated general population.

Why do this?

Well, I leave that up to you to decide.

I don't know Sam or any other AI influencers' motivations, but I laid out what to my knowledge is the true state of AI's current promise by these influencers.

Do you agree or disagree? I would love to hear your feedback.

Thank you."

7. **Endless Creativity**: Allows for quick experimentation with different design ideas. 
8. **Learning Tool**: Can help users understand design principles through practical application. 

# Cons:

1. **Learning Curve**: While easier than traditional design tools, users still need to learn how to effectively communicate their ideas to the AI. 
2. **Dependency on AI**: May lead to over-reliance on AI, potentially limiting the development of traditional design skills. 
3. **Limited Control**: For very specific or complex designs, the AI might not provide the level of fine-tuned control that professional design software offers. 
4. **Potential for Generic Designs**: If not used creatively, there's a risk of producing designs that lack uniqueness. 
5. **Internet Dependent**: Requires a stable internet connection to function. 
6. **Ethical Considerations**: As with all AI tools, there are ongoing discussions about the ethical implications of AI-generated content. 
7. **Subscription Cost**: While cost-effective compared to hiring designers, the ongoing subscription cost might be a consideration for some users. 
8. **Copyright Concerns**: Users need to be aware of potential copyright issues when modifying existing images. 

Despite these potential drawbacks, the pros of Phedra AI far outweigh the cons for most users, especially those who aren't professional designers. It offers a level of accessibility and efficiency in design that was previously unattainable for many.

Are you not supposed to use Identity outside of ASP.Net?,dotnet,1i9r7jt,2025-01-25 11:52:12,7,0.9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1i9r7jt/are_you_not_supposed_to_use_identity_outside_of/,TobbenTM,,"Using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity for all things auth related is super helpful, but does it break as soon as you want to generate tokens outside of ASP.Net?

I thought my use-case was fairly simple; I have an event handler, running as a console app, that sends emails to customers when events happen. Some of these emails should contain tokens for those customers, and I generate those using a `DataProtectorTokenProvider`.

Now the problem is that there is no longer a separate NuGet for Identity (there is one, but it's deprecated, only meant for old versions: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity#readme-body-tab).
With the reasoning being that these packages are now part of ASP.Net Core: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/19696#issuecomment-601959654

Do people not use these APIs outside of ASP.Net, or do you do a full `<FrameworkReference Include=""Microsoft.AspNetCore.App"" />` in your small console apps?"

It’s me again! Now with an updated thought exercise! Improved Domestic and diplomatic stuff. So enjoy!  
  
Queue the second term fanfiction! Since I’ve finished my Sordland AAR (link above) I wanted to make/create/envision a second term. Or headcanon, whatever you want to call it. But this is not an epilogue (yet), rather a list of ideas, plans and thought exercises of what would happen in a socialist Rayne’s second term. And if Suzerain wasn’t such a pain in the ass to mod I would try to make one. But alas.  
  
  
PS. If The pictures are fucky tell me I'll repost with it fixed.

**Main term mechanics/problems**

·       Coalition/cabinet stability/support

Now that Rayne has won a second term and the PSP has a plurality, he will be forced to form the first coalition government in Sordlands history. But with whom?

https://preview.redd.it/lmepfj4k46fe1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0985813a05a7ff7307c68f8b35c6bcd203e81382

So, from left to right: PSP, USP, NFP, PFJP, CPS, WPB and BFP  
So what are the options for a coalition?

\-The centrist way: a coalition with the PFJP. Coalition negotiations will require a lot of compromise on your socialist agenda but *should* not anger the more reactionary elements of the country, like the military. This will ofcourse include appeasing Ricter and keeping him happy. We don’t want a fallen government right? And not to mention you just *barely* have a majority in the GNA.  
I’ll call this coalition “the purple coalition” after blue+red=purple.  
**Coalition stability: middling + reactionary threat: low**

\-The revolutionary way:  a coalition with the CPS and the WBP should not be very difficult and you could go all out with your agenda. You also have a comfortable majority, that plus working with very like-minded parties government stability will not be a problem. Just make sure that you give Stahler and Leke a position in your cabinet.  
But for the rest of the political spectrum this would be an attack on the very spirit of Sordland itself, *according tot hem anyway.* So expect major problems with the USP and NFP.  
I’ll call this “the scarlet coalition” because scarlet sounds better than red.  
**Coalition stability: high + reactionary threat: high**

**-** The ‘destined to fail’ way: a coalition with the PFJP and the CPS/WPB. Why would you do this? Your agenda will be impossible to satisfy both sides who will be constantly bickering about everything. Atleast you have a good majority in the GNA, but don’t take their loyalty for granted. And on top of a wonky coalition, conservatives wil not be happy about the CPS/WPB in government.  
I’ll call this “the Red bird coalition” after the PFJP’s bird.  
**Coalition stability: low + reactionary threat: middling**

 

\-So Anton has formed a coalition, but what next? Maintaining that coalition ofcourse. Basicly if Anton diverts to much or doesn’t keep his promises from the coalition negotiations (like being too planned econ with the PFJP) the government falls wich means you now have a minority government, a few empty cabinet spots and have lost the trust of the people.

 

·       Reactionary influence/terrorists

\-Sordlands transition to socialism will not be warmly received by large parts of the country. Like the USP/NFP and the military. Ofcourse reactionary resistance will be higher or lower depending on the coalition you chose to form.

\-The USP and the NFP will form the “United Sordish Front” even if you chose the centrist coalition. If you are extra mean to the PFJP and disrespect them enough they will join the USF, enlarging the opposition but destabilising it.

\-Now the USF is a mix of free-market capitalists and moderate reformists (Ricterists), Sollists (Lileasists) and Sordist nationalists (Kibenerists). They will do everything to undermine you and make you fail. Because in their eyes you are destroying Sordland.  
Now you can try to undermine *them*, sowing distrust amongst the wings, negotiating with one wing instead of the whole USF as example. Fabricating scandals etc.

\-But outside the GNA the Young Sords are still running around and *they will not be happy.*  
So why not make another terrorist group? The “Saviors of Sordland” has a good ring to it no? Active in Agnolia and parts of Gruni. The most ignored region and the most reactionary region respectively. Again the strenght of the SS will depend how radical your government is, but you can still expect asassinations and bombings.

3 options of resistance that depends on the coalition you picked:  
\- Agnland resistance: low, Gruni resistance: almost nonexisting  
\-AR: high, GR: middling  
\-AR: middling, GR: low

·       Military loyalty

Our beloved general Egg (Iosef) and the rest of the military won’t be to happy with socialist Rayne so they need to be dealt with. Now military loyalty will be naturally low at the start, the coalition you pick will only improve loyalty a little bit or decrease it a lot.

\-How do ensure their loyalty? Well we can try throwing money at the military to keep them happy but that will not work forever…

\-We can slowly remove anti-socialist elements/figures under the guise of ‘doctrine changes’. But be carefull! The military is not that stupid.

\-You can ‘reassure’ the military by letting Iosef staying as defense ministry. But he will be a pain in the ass. So manage him carefully.

\-If the military is disloyal enough they might do something ‘rash’. Like supporting the reactionary SS and maybe even a coup. If you aren’t carefull enough.

·         Economic stability

Sordland finds itself in a new era of prosperity. But that can’t be the case forever.  
If you make questionable economic decisions, mismanage the planned economy, if there is to much unrest economic stability will decrease. Affecting future economic projects, the Sordish budget and the welfare of the nation.

\-If Economic stability drops to much the Sordish economy will stagnate and Rayne will lose considerable support.

\-How do we prevent this? Good question I don’t really know but probably by managing the budget correctly, allocating resources correctly and staying focused on economic goals (not flip-flopping to one thing and another).

·       Diplomatic activeness

Sordland is now part of the CSP and posseses the largest ATO-CSP border in the world (as far as we know). Sordland has the power to become a formidable regional power, I think Sordish diplomatic power can stretch from Rumburg to Nibiya, from Morella to Agard. This presents a couple of problems and opportunities, like courting Morella to join the CSP, undermining Arcasian interests in central and southern Merkopa (Qinal and Agard) and some ‘nation building’ in Rika. And don’t forget the growing tensions with Lespia and Agnolia.  
 Sordland has a few choices in the diplomatic arena, let’s go over them.

\-The sword of the CSP.  
Sordland makes strides to spread the revolution across the world!  
extensivily aiding(and influencing) Morella, Wehlen and Rikan nations to get them to join the CSP. Harrasing Lespia, Agnolia, Qinal and The Free Cities. And generally be a pain in the ass for ATO, and sometimes for United Contanta.

\-The lance of the CSP.  
Sordland will take the middle road and not upset the fragile balance *too* much. Still trying to expand the influence of the CSP and some mediating on the side. Also no harrasing nations.

\-The shield of the CSP.  
Sordland will avoid angering ATO and upsetting the balance in Merkopa and will be focused on strenghtening bonds with fellow CSP nations. And only partake in low risk diplomatic plans, international investment and aid. Sordland will also try to be a mediating force to prevent hostilities.

 

 

**Economic decisions, plans and opportunities**

Aright now that we have the main problems/mechanics of Rayne’s second term let’s talk about the economics!

 

·       Economic direction.  
Now that Sordish economy operates under a planned economy the question is what to do with it? Was this the end goal or is it a stepping stone?

\-Maintain the full command economy: The least risky option, it worked so far right so why fix it? This decision will not have much effect, it’ll keep people happy, the military won’t suspect anything and the economy will run *fine*. As long as you don’t screw things up.  
\[economic stability decreases more with ‘bad choices’\] \[the military and the USF won’t be angry *as much*\]

\-Transition to a socialist market economy: Cut back state control/intervention while maintaining socialist principles and put the workers first. It will be a delicate balance but the  added flexibility should be worth it. Again it is your choice how far you go with this. Will you fuck it up and create a system were the oligarchs can rise once again? Will you achieve the perfect balance of opportunity and workplace democracy? Or something in between?  
\[Economic stability will decrease less with ‘bad choices’\]\[The military and the USF won’t be happy but the moderates might be surprised and warm up to you\]

\-The Valgslandian way: You’re truly the idealist aren’t you Rayne? If you do this the proletariat will love you for it, Emmerich Hegel will love you for it and LUS/the Trade Unions too. Workerplace democracy, strenghtening the unions, decentralisation. You will try to create a true socialist economy that is centered on the common worker. Increasing effiency and public opinion. But at the cost of angering the reactionaries beyond saving, if you don’t take drastic measures prepare for a *significant* uptick in SS activities an expect the USF and the military to openly defy you and engage with *illegal activities*.  
\[Economic stability isn’t effected\]\[The military and the USF will ‘declare war’ on you\]

Economic focuses  
When I started Suzerain I was a little dissapointed with the lack of economic decisions so why not make my own? Now we have Economic directions, focuses and projects. Economic focuses are wich industry/region you want to focus on. This is quite long term so you can only pick one focus, so choose well.

\-Petrochemical expansion: Sordland has oil, gas and a very big important port. Lachaven is perfect for a large petrochemical industry. Oil refineries, gas refineries and plastic based industries. All essential to a thriving modern economy. To accomplish this huge investments are needed in Lachaven, Narbel and Estord.  
Now for a visual demonstration.  
Quick legend: Green=most economic impact/yellow= medium economic impact/Red= a little economic impact.  
Now this focus will make Lachaven even more of an economic juggernaut, and ofcourse for a petrochemical industry you need oil and gas so Narbel and Estord will also receive economic stimulation. And don’t forget that Gelsord also benefits from a strong Lachaven. Sordland will export more refined oil and plastic products in than anyone on the Merkopan continent! Exept Rizia ofcourse.  
 \[This focus will have greater effect if you’ve invested in Gasom\]

\-Expansion of high-tech industries:  We all love the Gelsord silicon valley synergy, because it’s good. So why not expand it even more? Electronics, advanced shipbuilding, advanced steelmaking, pharmaceuticals etc. With this risky and ambitious plan you will propel Sordland to new heights! And make the Sordish coast truly out of petrol, silicon and high-quality steel! Ofcourse with such a big plan you need to chose on what part you will focus the most. On Morna and Morbel steelmaking and engine factories? Or on the radio factories and the labs in Gelsord? Or on general manufacturing in Greater Holsord? Gelsord and Greater Holsord will see new heights! Lorren will also heavily benefit, after all we all need steel and engines. And ofcourse some slight positives for Lachaven and Deyr. With this plan Sordland will become one of the most technological economies in the world! Exept the superpowers ofcourse.  
\[This focus will have greater effect if you’ve invested in electronic industries\]

\-Expansion of manufacturing/heavy industries: Become the workshop of the world. Why inovate if everything still works? Textiles, furniture, glass, and paper industries. A quite safe focus but should still be exremely beneficial. Primarely focused on the Greater Holsord and Lorren areas Gelsord and Lachaven should still get a boost. And expect export to explode. \[This focus has greater effect if you’ve done Conriat Industrial City\]

\-Expansion of agriculture and mineral extraction: And finally some love for Bergia and Gruni. Becoming the bread basket of Merkopa will be difficult but with enough shrewd investment it should be possibe. And mineral xports are always needed. Zinc, copper, silver, iron, coal and even uranium *perhaps*, are all minerals that nations pay high prices for. With this plan Gruni and Sarna will be cultivating crops wile Ribel and the south of Greater Holsord will be extracting the ground of out great nation!  
\[Investments in Gruni and Bergia will make this plan more succesfull\]

Economic projects  
These projects are like the L-1 and the Conriat industrial city projects. *Relatively* small in comparisons with the others. But with Sordlands economy back on track you can afford TWO projects at a time! Isn’t that amazing! These projects will have a synergy with economic focuses, other decisions and diplomatic stuffs.

\-Expansion of the L-1 railway to Morna, Conriat and Estord: Pretty self-explanitory, better rail connection equals happier citizens and economic growth. A pretty safe option and will help turn Sordlands coast into an economic powerhouse.

\-Expansion of L-1 railway to Deyr, Erzaren and Wizen: A plan to better connect Bergia tot he rest of Sordland. And a plan to increase connectivity with Wehlen, Smolak will love you for it but it will have diplomatic consequences, positive and negative.

https://preview.redd.it/uo4l212426fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4b6725f84d8e579af3e9c66cb835f4d5f6de823

\-Expansion of Agnland infrastructure: Finally! Somebody has not forgotten Agnland! With the revival of the H-3 project and the expansion of the L-1 railway to arvory Agnland will finally stop being a backwater! But this will not really help with the economy (except Agnland) but the people will be happy.

https://preview.redd.it/mtkqbhpe26fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=52c084863df4cc7f850f409a4bfea5b70305e09d

·       -Estord oil expansion: We will always need more oil so why not? And ofcourse this will work well with the petrochemical plan.

\-Gelsord inovation hub: Gelsord is already the most advanced city in Sordland, so why not take that to the next level? Also what’s with those ‘robots’ I keep hearing about?

\-Ribel mining expansion: The mountains around Ribel are filled with metals and minerals, if we can expand the operations there it wouldy surely benefit us.

\-Morbel industry modernization program: upgrading those metallurgy plants and heavy transport factories will make Morbel once again the king of steel and smog in Lorren!

PS. I wanted to include a ‘make a nuclear powerplant’ project but I think that’s a little far fetched, for now.

It’s the military’s turn! So what’s on the agenda? Well, doctrine changes, budget changes, managing Iosef and a few more things.  
  
  


·       Doctrine changes  
Well it’s time for a few changes in the military! War always changes so Sordland needs to get with the times. But how will Rayne achieve that? And will Rayne use this as an excuse to purge the military?  
PS. I’ve just read a comment from u/jistiesep about Sordland’s miliary so I’m going to take a few things from that so thank you u/jistiesep! Also here is their comment:  
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
\-The army: The doctrine of the Sordish army is severly outdated, relying on infantry assault and is full of officers like Valken. Time to change this, but how?  
  
Option 1: Do nothing, keep the old doctrine, ofcourse this will be detrimental for any future engangements but maybe you didn’t want to risk anything  
  
Option 2: Switch to ‘combined arms warfare’/more ‘modern’ doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I’m not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Iosef alligned-*mostly* moderate officers.  
\[Iosef will be happy and trust you more, military loyalty doesn’t change, the military is more *United*\]  
  
Option 3: Switch to ‘combined arms warfare’/more ‘modern’ doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I’m not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Socialist and regime-friendly officers  
\[Iosef will not be happy, military loyalty will increase, the military grows further *divided*\]  
  
Now this repeats for the air force and the navy, but what does the ‘Iosef happy meter’, ‘military loyalty’ and ‘military unity’ mean?  
  
\-Iosef happy meter: pretty simple, if Iosef isn’t happy he will start working against you. So be nice to him, prioritise funding for his projects and give him more influence. But that can be a two bladed sword, if you give him to much influence and *then anger him* he will turn the entire military against you. And if that happens you’re fucked  
  
On the other hand if you manage things right you can deprive him of allies and isolate the Egg, without him even knowing it.  
  
\-Military loyalty: a little less simple, still basicly represents how well the military listens to you, if it is to low they will refuse to take your orders, be more likely to help your militant opposition and will coup you if they can find an authority figure to rally behind.  
  
Now how do increase loyalty? By getting socialist officers into the military ofcourse! You can try to isolate high command by replacing the lower-ranking officer corp or try to a ‘quick purge’ of high command under the guise of doctrine changes. Both of these have ther up- and downsides.  
  
\-Military unity: When you are trying to make the military more friendly to you by appointing socialist officers and other things you are also dividing the military politically, opening the way for infighting. This ofcourse comes with it’s own myriad of problems.  
  


·       Military procurement  
  
Every military needs more weapons, *new* weapons too. New armored vehicles, jet aircraft, assault rifles, missiles, helicopters, boats etc. Ofcourse there are a few things that can influence these decisions, like budget, different schools of thought and industrial/intellectual capabality.  
  
\-Budget: Pretty simple, how much will you spend on projects and the military as a whole? Granting bigger budgets will make the military happy and give better results. But if you’re too liberal with funding they may get careless and wastefull. And ofcourse you can veto the projects but that will not make the military happy.  
  
\-Different opinions: One guy thinks the new jet should prioritise guns and minimise it’s turnrate while the other guy wants to focus on the range and those new heat-seeking missiles. These ‘guys’ have their alignment and loyalties, choosing/supporting one guy over the other strengthens ‘that guy’s’ position in the military thus increasing or decreasing Iosef’s/Old-Guard/Socialist influence.  
  
\- Industrial/intellectual capabality: Sordland is not a superpower, it still needs to buy a lot of it’s own military hardware and licenses. So it’s delusional to think that Sordland can completely design, test and produce it’s own military equipment. So you need to decide how much help you import from outside. If you import to much the military will be displeased and you will be more reliant on the CSP. On the other hand if you try to do everything on your own could compromise the quality of the equipment.  
  
  


·       Military wages and pensions  
  
Here is were the comment of u/ Domitien comes in, it boils down to the point that probably most of the military budget is used for huge military pensions and wages for officers from the Soll era. seems like an easy way to cut expenses, all those old officers and vets are almost dead anyway. But this WILL make the military angry.  
  


  
  
**Domestic stuff**

Alright, this part is about education, healtcare, dealing with the reactionary resistance, the Bludish and a few other things. So let’s start.

 

·       Welfare state  
  
You can’t be socialist without a welfare state righ?  
Welfare state’s are popular yes but they do cost a lot so what will you do?  
  
\-Just expand on the existing structure: Nothing special, better pensions, housing assistence, unemployment subsidies etc. still quit popular and won’t cost as much.  
  
\-enlarge the welfare state substantially: Make school (almost) entirely free, implement a system that increases wages if inflation increases (Belgium style). And more.  
  
\-Make UBI a reality: Try to give everyone a garanteed wage, ofcourse you can implement in different ways. Maybe link it to the rent of an appartment, the proce of groceries or go all out so that ‘in principle’ no Sordish man needs to work anymore. But this will have consequences.  
  


·       Healtcare  
  
\-Do you invest more into healtcare? Do you choose between removing the last differences between rural and urban hospitals? Or do you focus on advancing medical technology in the cities, leaving the countyside in the dust?  
  


·       Education  
  
\-More money for Ms Walda? Do you focus on school accessibility to destroy illiteracy or do you focus on the sciences and the universities to make Sords the smartest people in Merkopa? Again do you focus on the countryside or the cities.  
  


·       The Bludish  
  
\-Who can forget about the Bludish? I don’t really have an ideas about this but I guess you can focus on deradicalising the Bludish population with subsidies and stimilus packages. And officially/publically condem the Izzam incident.  
  
  


·       Public transport  
  
very expensive project but will also make you very popular  
  
\-Light rail expansion: connect a lot of small rural towns across Sordland to the rail network. Rural population will like this.  
  
\-Metro and tram expansion: Make big cities better and more prepared for bigger populations. Urban population will like this.  
  
\-Construct a bus fleet: I don’t know if Sordland has buses but it has them now! Connect rural towns and big cities alike. Everyone likes this a little bit.  
  
  


·       Land redistribution  
  
\-One of the central socialist policies, take land from big landowners and give it to the common farmer. Pretty simple concept. Again you decide how far you go with this. But in short small farmers like you more and the landowners don’t.  
  
  


·       Reactionary resistance  
  
\-You’re a socialist president in a socialist government in a socialist superpower bloc. People aren’t stupid, they will fight against you. The core reactionaries of the Saviours of Sordland (SS) recruit from people who are dissatisfied with your ideas and policies. People in Agnland who feel forgotten. Conservative rural people who think you’re an urban elite, Military veterans etc.  
Now it’s your job to deal with them.  
  
\-Option one: Use the military to crush the SS. Sounds straight forwrd but isn’t. I think the SAF isn’t that good in fighting guerilla warfare (evident by their inability to destroy the BFF) So it might be too difficult. So if you fail again and again the political opposition might see an opportunity.  
  
\-Option 2: Try to destroy their base. Can’t locate SS cells in Arvory because nobody gives any information because they dislike the government? Make sure you appear concerned with their problems and make sure they have food on the table with a stable job.  
  
Now you also have the Red Youth to use. These determined socialist will do about everything you ask, wether you want it or not. They can be very usefull in fighting the SS and the Young Sords but using them to much discredits your government and make you appear tyrannical. If you use them to often and give them to much resources while you aren’t socialist enough they might attempt something rash, and maybe United Contana is looking for a new arrangement too…  


·       Endgame  
  
Now this is something that just came to mind. At the end of Rayne’s second term when you have solidified socialist control over the military, significantly decreased reactionary power and created a succesfull socialist economy. You should be able to finally declare the ‘People’s Socialist Democratic Republic of Sordland’ or maybe you want to drop a few adjectives  and just have the ‘Socialist Republic of Sordland’.  


**Diplomacy**  
  
  


Who doesn’t love diplomacy? Sordland has a lot of opportunities on the world stage. Let’s go over a few.  
  
the main focus (acording to me) would be to enlarge the CSP, Morrella and Wehlen. Creating problems for ATO, infiltrating/isolating Lespia. And while doing those things maybe gain some military, economical benefits?  


·       Wehlen  
  
The funny man’s domain, Wehlen is a pseudo-socialist genocidal state that conveniently is anti-west and thus likes us. So why not use it to further the CSP’s and our interests?  
  
\-Give him money: just give him money, promise him investments to increase Wehlen’s wealth. You can also promise Smolak a new fancy mansion.  
  
\-Give him guns: give him weapons pretty simple.  
  
But why do this? To get Wehlen into the CSP and isolate Lespia and exert pressure on ATO in central Merkopa ofcourse.  
  
But president Smolak can be a wild card, so maybe you are planning to remove him from the picture and replace him with someone less controversial, and more loyal…  


·       Morella  
  
Morella would be the first South Merkopan nation to join the CSP and they’re actively trying to join so with an injection of a few billion Sordish Ren and military equipment they should have no problem joining the revolution!  
  
Now here is where the infiltration comes in. If you are really want to spread the revolutions you can *try* to infiltrate theses nations and fund Malyenevist groups.  
  
But don’t take it too far! You’re shenanigans can be uncovered and even United Contana will tell you too stop if you take it to far.

·       Rumburg  
  
Honestly I don’t think Rumburg will be that much of a pain the ass. They can’t really use the BFF because you gave the Bludish rights. They can’t bully you because you’re in the CSP.  
  
But that doesn’t mean YOU can’t be a pain in the ass for THEM.  
How does it feel Beatrice when foreign powers arm terrorists who want to overthrow the government? HOW DOES IT FEEL?!!  
  
Again with enough *discreet* support you can tie down the Rumburg army and government in a guerilla war in their own country, with their own people. And we know what guerilla wars do to nations.  
  


·       Agard  
  
The ATO’s very own drug-trafficing hub. Now there is a very big opportunity here to spread the revolution. Nobody in their right mind WANTS to live in a damn mafia-state so resistance movements should be plentifull.  
Now there should be few opportunities/choices for you to interfere.  
(All resistance/group names are product of my own fantasy/insanity, non are canon)  
  
\-Support the Aegardian Democrats: Centrist democratic opposition, pretty mild in their anti-establishment actions. They prefer to keep things legal in a country where laws don’t mean anything, so hopelesly naive. If you fund them enough they might be able to exercise enough power to soft-coup the narco-lord Severo Rios(head of government), leading to them cracking down on the drug trade but they will keep the ATO observer status unless you place some strings in their government.  
  
\-Support the Magka Group: A rival drug cartel that would like Rios’ head on a stick. Not the nicest but an easy option to support, they’re violent and ready to shoot up Rios’ palace. Now if you fund them enough they can replace Severo Rios’ leading to no change or even an increase in the drug trade but if you promise the new head guy a nice mansion and enough gold toilets he will rescind that ATO observer status for you.  
  
\-Support the Fruma Guerilla’s: The hardcore Malenyevist group in Agard. With their influence concentrated around the central lake they have the advantage that they can evade government attacks quite easily. Now their military power has decreased in recent years but if manage to pump enough guns and money into them they will gladly march to Ardeal and burn the drug lords tot he ground. But beware, ATO WILL notice that a waning guerilla army has just out of nothing gained traction again. So thread carefully.  
  


·       The Free Cities  
  
A Dastnurity confederacy that’s buddies with Arcasia and also rich with tourist money. Now I imagine TFC is quite a stable country so no revolution possible. But you can pull some strings.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Jathlas’ Federalists: An upcoming movement that calls for more integration and for an even closer relationship with ATO. Now you can plant some agents, create corruption scandals, leak those scandals. If you’re succesfull you can kill the movement before it can seize control.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Confederate Dastnuritists: The embodiment of the status quo in TFC. still this presents an opportunity, if you empower them enough you can a political deadlock between them and the Federalists. And you can also pull a few strings, maybe prevent that third ATO base in the south?  
  
\-Support the Golcondist insurgents: Pro Derdian Golcondists who want to reach Golconda by making life hell for TFC. So why not help them? If you’re succesfull enough they will tie down quite a bit of ATO resources, for a few years at least.  
  


·       Qinal  
  
Aaah… ATO’s main partner in Xina, and one that openly defied Arcasia in the past. They are on good terms right now but maybe we can dig up those tensions somehow?  
  
\-Support the Qinali Liberal Party: Contrary tot heir name the QLP are on the right part of the Qinali political spectrum, the *far* right. They champion Qinaly exceptionalism, independence from foreign influence and economic statism. At this point they are a small faction in parlement but a loud one. With some extra funds they will do better but if you manage to dig up/fabricate another PMC scandal the QLP will surge in popularity, and with those elections coming up…  
  
\-Support the Qinali Unbowed Party: A new small extraparlementary party trying to present a left alternative to the ruling coalition. Now they aren’t Malenyevist or even socialist but they are friendlier and more open to other ‘vieuwpoints’. Now if you manage to get them into parlement they *maybe* can get in a coalition as a minor partner. Perhaps not that effective at fighting ATO’s influence but it’s a nice foundation to build upon.  
  
  


·       Lespia  
  
Lespia, who doesn’t hate that drunk son of a bitch Alvarez? I imagine two ways you can go about dealing with them.  
  
\-The agressive way: Start by sending agents into Lespian cities and the country side, identify people and groups who are willing to ‘cooperate’ and ‘present an alternative’ to the status quo. Arm them, drill them. Spy on the government and the military.  
And when the Lespian status quo starts to fall and Alvarez’ control starts to slip, use them to burn the bourgois to the ground.  
  
\-The diplomatic way: The world is one misfire from a Sordish/Lespian rifle away from nuclear hellfire. So inflating tensions might not bet he best idea. So organize a few diplomatic visits, maybe sign some token demiliterization agreements. So when that spark inevitable sets Perla on fire the Lespian government trusts you and are willing to cooperate more.  
  
Apart from that you can park a naval fleet *just* outside their territorial waters or fly an airplane in to their airspace. Basicly intimidation attemps and being a real asshole for ATO. But this does not come without consequences, a lot of nations will see you raising tensions needlessly and they won’t be happy.  
  
  
  


 

**Diplomatic crisis**

We all know that Sordland’s population is *weird*, really 37 million? Rizia has 40 million Lespia has 60 million for god’s sake. It just doesn’t make any sense. So I though up an in-universe explanation.  
  
Basicly the repression of the Sordish King, the instability of the first republic, the civil war and the Soll stagnation caused a shit ton of Sords to emigrate. Hence the low population. And here is the seed of a diplomatic crisis that will almost lead to war.  
  
Now that Sordland is in a better state president Rayne will seek to bring these people back to Sordland. So he basicly says to the world: “If you are a Sord In Lespia, Agnolia, Valgsland etc. Come back! We have a big stimulus, house and a job to give you!”. Now I estimate that around 2,5 million Sords live abroad, most of them in Lespia serving as cheap labor. So when these underpaid underappreciated (probably target of racism) hear that they can go back to their home country for a better life they will drop everything and go. But you know Lespians, they love their cheap labor! So they prevent them from leaving so the Sords protest the government wich leads to a riot wich leads to the police fireing on the Sordish protestors. Wich causes national outrage and within a week the streets of Perla and Falenco are on fire, major protests erupting across the country, The Sordish protestors are now joined by lower class Lespians who want an end to the inequality.  
  
Now it’s YOUR job to react to this. Your largest rival is on fire, activily murdering your people and their own too. So what do you do?  
  
\-Ramp up funding for revolutionary groups to destabilise Lespia even more, making Alvarez even more desperate, making him more likely to accept terms.  
  
\-Deploy the military to DEMAND that Lespia allow all Sords to safely leave the country, and if they don’t…  
  
\-Use diplomacy, try to get the rest of ATO and the AN to agree with you demands.  
  
Ofcourse you can use a combination of all of these to get your way. But if this little crisis last to long it will grow out of control. Lespia is teetering on the edge of a cliff so ATO is **desperate** to prevent a revolution. While this is happening both the SAF and the LAF (Lespian Armed Forces) are staring eachother down at the border, opening the possibility of ‘incidents’ that can escalate the crisis into a full blow war. And if that happens you’re in big trouble. Again you’re *one misfire* away from nuclear hellfire, don’t forget that.

  
  
  
  
**Conclusion**

 

Alright, now I would like to hear your critisisms on my medieval scroll-sized post.  
Eventually I will make an ‘official’ epilogue for Red Sunrise over Sordland.  
And know that I think about it I may just make an in-dept post about the Lespia crisis, and find a better name for it. I’m open to suggestions!  
  
And special shout-out to u/Nice-Pianist-9944

An N=1 Experience with Turk Builder,GregDoucette,1i9qls4,2025-01-25 11:25:35,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GregDoucette/comments/1i9qls4/an_n1_experience_with_turk_builder/,Mysterious_Scheme_54,,"I've been holding off on writing this, but given Coach Greg's [notice](https://youtu.be/PytObdLw3QY?si=HyQjATL2DSET14d_&t=930) to post results from using Turk, here it goes.

**Background**

As a lifetime natural wary of the supplement industry, three things must be true in order for a supplement to be worth taking:

1. The supplement must be what the label claims it is, in the proper dosage
2. The supplement at its dosage must be safe
3. The supplement at its dosage must work, or at least have strong evidence supporting its efficacy

I started this project when Coach Greg was claiming he had real turkesterone but before he posted the video exposing the fake turkesterone companies. My premise was, *if we suppose he is selling turkesterone at the stated dose, is it safe and does it work?* I bought a bottle of Turk Builder and decided to investigate.

This case study was divided into two parts: a 40-day control period where I took nothing, and a 40-day treatment period where I took one pill of Turk Builder as instructed on the bottle. To assess safety, during the control period, I got bloodwork done for testosterone (I had other lab results from my yearly physicals when I also wasn't on anything, but these didn't include a test panel, which in full transparency isn't the best way scientifically to do this but I wanted to save $100 or so on foregoing the other panels), and towards the end of the treatment period, I got my CBC, CMP, urinalysis, lipids, A1C, and testosterone checked to see if Turk Builder affected these values. All bloodwork was drawn in the morning after breakfast.

To assess efficacy, I measured body composition with an InBody Scan from a local gym. I measured this three times: on the first day of the control period, on first day of the treatment period, and the day after finishing the Turk Builder. The scans were all done in the morning after a light breakfast (ideally they would have been done at the same time on an empty stomach, but work got in the way). Bioelectrical impedance is not a perfect measurement that is subject to numerous sources of error, but my thinking was that if Turk Builder works well, such a result should be able to peak above the noise.

**Results**

My bloodwork while on one pill QD of turkesterone was fairly similar to that of my control bloodwork. My glucose was a bit low (57 mg/dL), and I'm not sure why that would be, as I felt fine before and after getting that bloodwork done. My AST and ALT, which I was most concerned about given the effects of anabolics on the liver, were in the upper limit of normal (39 and 41), which is consistent with previous bloodwork (40 and 34). Interestingly, while on Turk, my testosterone was 452, while it measured at 364 during the control period. However, I imagine this has more to do with my getting 5.5-6.5 hours of sleep nightly before the control draw and 7-7.5 hours of sleep nightly in the week before the treatment blood draw.

During the control period, my skeletal muscle mass increased to 75.8 lbs from 74.5 lbs (+1.3 lbs). My fat mass increased to 30.2 lbs from 29.3 lbs (+0.9 lbs), and my body fat percentage rose 0.1 percentage points. I weigh myself every morning after using the bathroom, which gives a more accurate measurement since I haven't eaten and don't have clothes on at that point, and the weight values here are my average weight from the three days before and after each scan. My weight rose to 163.3 lbs from 161.5 lbs (+1.8 lbs).

During the treatment period, my skeletal muscle mass decreased to 74.5 lbs (-1.3 lbs). My fat mass increased to 31.1 lbs (+0.9 lbs), and my body fat percentage rose 0.8 percentage points. Using the same methodology as above, my weight increased to 164.1 lbs (+0.8 lbs).

No side effects were noted during the control period. However, while taking Turk my two most noticeable side effects were being hungrier and brain fog, the latter of which was annoying. I was perhaps a tad more aggressive when driving but not otherwise. Turk did not feel stimulatory; it did not make me feel more amped or pumped at the gym, and even when taking it before a late-night workout it did not affect my sleep.

**Discussion**

To me, these results suggest that one pill daily of Turk Builder is likely safe (though I am not a doctor), so perhaps a higher dosage would also be safe, though this would need to be evaluated.

The data also suggest that Turk does not have a large effect. If I recall correctly, Coach Greg said his weight increased by 7 pounds or something in like two weeks or a month after starting Turk. It's possible he was taking more, or that he's a better responder, or something else entirely, but taking one pill showed no detectable effect on my body composition. While I think it's funny I ""lost"" 1.3 pounds of muscle while taking Turk, this is likely more due to fluctuations in water, electrolytes, and machine variability/error than actual muscle loss, as I certainly did not (cannot) gain 1.3 pounds of muscle tissue in 40 days.

It's possible that taking two, three, or more pills of Turk does make a detectable difference, in muscle growth. A longer treatment period should also be used to better evaluate the efficacy of turkesterone – 40 days is almost nothing in the timecourse of a trained, natural lifter for gaining muscle. My hope was that Turk would be effective enough in that short window to demonstrate a difference, but evidently not.

Obviously, the small sample size, instrument of measure, and study design all present challenges to the results and prevent drawing definitive findings. Ideally, and randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial would be best to truly evaluate the safety and efficacy of turkesterone, and I would be very interested in seeing one. However, even if it does work, the brain fog would likely dissuade me from trying Turk in the future.

Finally, in full transparency, I did reach out to HTLT about getting a full refund. They wrote: ""After much consideration, sadly, we are unable to process your money back guarantee refund because our policy states that you need to return a bottle that is not empty"". However, they did give me a $20 refund instead, which isn't the money-back guarantee Coach Greg claims, but it's better than nothing I guess. My thinking was that I should use the whole bottle to better evaluate the efficacy of Turk, but that's the way it is. So if you are going to ask for a refund, make sure you still have pills left over (why? so they can resell them? Idk seems a little sketchy

Problem with Star Citizen Vulkan,starcitizen,1i9qhkg,2025-01-25 11:20:28,5,0.77,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1i9qhkg/problem_with_star_citizen_vulkan/,No_Analyst1481,DISCUSSION,"o7 to everyone.  
I have a strange problem with Star Citizen and VULKAN.   
I have 5800X3D, 64 gb ram(2x32, 3600 mhz ADATA), RX6700 XT and 650w PSU, gigabyte ds3h b550m

I cannot use VULKAN on Star Citizen anymore. why? I have no idea.

ERROR 732823392  
I will try to explain here:  
For me VULKAN in SC is much stable than using DirectX11 (stutters a lot)  
The problem is if I want to use VULKAN in Star Citizen, it only works for the first time after i install my graphics driver. I Install Adrenaline -> start Star Citizen -> it does those shader caches(134k) and the game will run flawlessly.  
I can play even 12h without any problems. After I finish playing SC and I restart my computer, the next time SC won't wanna load with VULKAN. When it should load the menu it goes all black and the game closes the game and it shows me verify error. if I do the verify, it says it's perfectly fine.  
If I delete the shader cache from c:/user/local/starcitizen folder it's the same bullshit.  
I can use vulkan in Star Citizen only if I reinstall my graphics driver and it will work until i restart my pc.  
Did anyone have this problem?  
In c:/user/local/starcitizen folder I also check the game.log (to check for errors but I cannot understad)  
It's something like this in that game.log folder :

How Secure Is My Setup? Looking for Expert Opinions,cybersecurity_help,1i9q87c,2025-01-25 11:09:04,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity_help/comments/1i9q87c/how_secure_is_my_setup_looking_for_expert_opinions/,YTDaniel2021,,"Hi everyone,

I’m extremely security-conscious and familiar with IT forensic tools like Cellebrite and Oxygen. Despite this, I’m curious to know if there’s any way someone could bypass the extensive security measures I’ve implemented on my phone. I’d love to hear insights from anyone who might know of vulnerabilities or advanced methods I haven’t considered.

Here’s my current security setup:

1. Samsung Maximum Lock is fully enabled.


2. USB connections are set to charge-only by default, and USB access is completely disabled when the screen is locked.


3. All critical data is stored in the Knox Secure Folder, which is configured to remain encrypted and locked even after a restart.


4. Within the Knox Secure Folder, I use Droidfs to encrypt my most important files with AES-256, secured by a password over 20 characters long.


5. Unlocking the device via the Samsung Account is disabled.


6. My phone restarts automatically every day at 11:30 PM.


7. I’ve activated an eSIM, which remains active even after a restart.



With all these measures in place, I’m wondering: is there still any realistic way someone could compromise my device? I’m particularly interested in input from those familiar with advanced techniques or potential weaknesses I might have overlooked.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!"

NOTE: Previously Posted -  Update on the DEA's efforts to reschedule cannabis: what you need to know,TLRY,1i9pzpy,2025-01-25 10:58:51,17,0.87,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TLRY/comments/1i9pzpy/note_previously_posted_update_on_the_deas_efforts/,DaveHervey,News,"September 11, 2024 8:18 AM MDT  Updated 4 months ago

Commentary Attorney Analysis from Westlaw Today, a part of Thomson Reuters.

September 11, 2024 - As readers of this column know, earlier this year the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) finally acted on President Biden's call to reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which is seen as the biggest step towards federal legalization in more than half a century. We previously summarized these changes and their potential implications in our September 2023, opens new tab and May 2024, opens new tab articles.

Although the process — which the DEA is pursuing via a rulemaking — will not be completed before the Presidential Election in November (which may bring a shift in priorities at the DEA), it is worthwhile to provide an update on the current status of these efforts. Current status of rescheduling and next steps Since the announcement in April 2024 that it had agreed with the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) earlier recommendation to reschedule cannabis, the DEA opened a 60-day public comment period for the public to weigh in on the proposed rule. That window closed on July 22, 2024. Close to 43,000 comments were submitted from an array of stakeholders, including anti-legalization activists, cannabis industry advocates, state cannabis regulators, medical professionals, researchers, and law enforcement officials.

Barely a month later, on Aug. 27, the DEA announced that it will hold a hearing before an administrative law judge on the cannabis rescheduling proposal — a process effectively resembling a trial that could take months, if not years, to complete. The hearing is currently set for Dec. 2, 2024, after the election. Stakeholders interested in speaking at the hearing, have until Sept. 25, 2024, to register their request in accordance with the Notice of Hearing, opens new tab. The length of the hearing will depend on how many parties are permitted to testify. Considering the tens of thousands of comments received, this could be a fairly large number.

Once the hearing is completed, the presiding administrative law judge will write and file a report on the testimony provided. Then, the DEA still needs to review the report and write its final rulemaking, which must take into consideration all relevant materials presented during the public comment period. It must also address significant issues raised in the comments and provide a reasoned explanation for its decisions. Once that is completed, the final rulemaking will be published in the Federal Register. It is entirely possible that the final rulemaking could face legal challenges prior to its effective date (which, at a minimum, will be 30 days following publication). Alternatively, the DEA may feel the need to reopen the public comment period based on new information received during the hearing, which would result in further delays.

Growing support for rescheduling and legalization 

While the rescheduling proposal grinds its way through the administrative review process, research continues to bolster the case for rescheduling, showing the efficacy of cannabis in treating chronic pain, epilepsy, and other conditions, and suggesting a lower risk of abuse than previously assumed — points highlighted by federal health regulators as part of their recommendation to reschedule cannabis. For example, a recent study, opens new tab published in the journal PLoS One found that patients with chronic health conditions, including anxiety, depression, or chronic pain, saw significant improvements in their overall quality of life during the first three months of medical cannabis use. There has also been a notable increase in bipartisan support for rescheduling cannabis, reflecting broader societal changes. As we've noted in previous articles, a growing number of lawmakers, medical professionals, and advocacy groups have voiced their support, pressuring the DEA to act. Indeed, a recent analysis, opens new tab of the public comments conducted by cannabis data firm Headset highlights this fact. Headset's analysis found that 92.45% of the comments were in favor of reclassifying cannabis under federal law, while only 7.55% of responses were against reclassification. Ongoing challenges and uncertainties Despite the potential benefits, several challenges persist, including regulatory hurdles, complex implementation logistics, and continued opposition from certain law enforcement groups and conservative lawmakers. For example, the House Appropriations Committee recently approved an amendment to a funding bill that would essentially block the current Administration's ongoing efforts to reschedule cannabis and ease restrictions on the drug under federal law. Under the amendment approved by the Republican-led committee, the Department of Justice would be blocked from spending federal funds to reschedule or (de-schedule) cannabis under federal law. U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT 3rd District) introduced an amendment to remove the provisions seeking to block rescheduling, but the committee defeated the proposal by a vote of 20-30. Moreover, given the slow pace of the rescheduling process, there is a risk that the incoming Presidential Administration could change course or otherwise insert themselves in the process. It seems unlikely that a Harris Administration would significantly change course, as rescheduling cannabis during her first term in office would be a significant achievement, leaving the possibility for further reform in a second term. For Donald Trump, the possibilities are less clear, as the former President's position on cannabis keeps changing. Most recently, in a Sept. 8, 2024, Truth Social post, opens new tab, Trump expressed support for a ballot initiative in his home state of Florida that would legalize cannabis for adults (although he stopped short of formally endorsing the measure). However, if he once again chooses a conservative attorney general along the lines of Jeff Sessions, that could pose significant challenges. In addition, the complexities of aligning federal policy with state-level cannabis regulations remain a significant challenge. While rescheduling could streamline research and access, Schedule III drugs are regulated (and tested) more stringently than cannabis under many existing state laws (saying nothing of the unlicensed, but often tolerated, market). Many cannabis advocates are also concerned with the long-term implications for smaller players who cannot compete with well-financed new entrants from the pharmaceutical, tobacco, and alcohol markets. Finally, while rescheduling would bring some immediate relief to participants in the state-legal medical and recreational cannabis programs by taking cannabis out of the exclusion of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E (which precludes tax deductions for trafficking in Schedule I and Schedule II substances, but not Schedule III), Congressional action is still needed overall to bring federal cannabis policy in line with state policy. For example, a recent Legal Sidebar, opens new tab published by the Congressional Research Service concluded that rescheduling cannabis is unlikely by itself to eliminate the legal risks of financial institutions serving cannabis businesses and is, thus, not likely to increase most state-legal cannabis companies' access to financial services without other legal changes.

# Conclusion 

The DEA's efforts to reschedule cannabis mark a significant shift in federal drug policy. While reclassification represents a move towards aligning federal policy with contemporary scientific understanding, public sentiment and, to some extent, state laws, it also introduces new complexities and challenges. As the DEA finalizes its review, stakeholders from across the political spectrum are closely monitoring developments. The outcome of this process will likely have profound implications for cannabis research, medical access, and regulatory frameworks, shaping the future of cannabis policy in the United States.

How to install the mod to play The Big Bell Race in 6 players,ufo50,1i9py1c,2025-01-25 10:56:51,15,0.95,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo50/comments/1i9py1c/how_to_install_the_mod_to_play_the_big_bell_race/,greg065,19 - Big Bell Race‎ ‎ :19_-_BIG_BELL_RACE:,"So I was looking into this old mod, and I figured out how to install it:

1. Download UFO50 v1.3.1 using your [Steam Console](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873543244), input this string and press ENTER to download this version: `download_depot 1147860 1147861 5030479787659024307`
2. Once it's finished (it'll take some time to download) the game will be found in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_1147860`
3. Download the mod from the [UFO50 Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/krx76g7), remember to list all text channels, choose the V2 version.
4. Download Deltapatcher (if you modded Undertale or Pizza Tower you already know this part), open it, select the downloaded data.win as the target file and select the xdelta file as the patch, hit apply patch.
5. The mod is now installed. Remember that controllers are not supported by this mod, so you'll have to use something like antimicrox to remap button inputs to the keyboard.

I skipped many steps as I don't want the guide to be too long, but if you have a question, I can likely answer it. Another thing, in this mod, onion delivery has a 2 player mode, but the camera is shared.

I wish this was officially supported, as there are many more games that could benefit from multiplayer, like Bushido Ball, Pingolf, Hot Foot...

Also, to prevent save data corruption you can [boot the game without Steam activated](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/UFO_50#Availability) and rename the [save data folder](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/UFO_50#Save_game_data_location) temporarily. This is just an extra measure, I can't tell if your save data is going to be damaged or not by using an older version of the game.

This mod hasn't been updated in a while, don't think we'll get more out of it. But hey, you can play in 6 players once, and then likely never again! Lol"

Crypto Exchanges Under Scrutiny as Canada Cracks Down On Drug-Related Money Laundering,Blockviews,1i9pioj,2025-01-25 10:37:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i9pioj/crypto_exchanges_under_scrutiny_as_canada_cracks/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Canada steps up its game in monitoring crypto transactions amid rising concerns over synthetic opioid-driven money laundering.

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) has issued a fresh alert highlighting the increasing misuse of digital assets in laundering proceeds from fentanyl and opioid trafficking. Drawing from detailed financial data, patterns, and law enforcement insights, the alert flags high-risk activity such as large crypto-to-fiat conversions from new accounts and transactions using multiple wallets to obscure origins.

This move fits into Canada’s broader initiative under the North American Drug Dialogue, aimed at dismantling synthetic opioid-related activities. FINTRAC encourages virtual asset service providers and financial institutions to integrate these red flags into their anti-money laundering frameworks.

The updated alert also underscores the importance of collaboration across the crypto ecosystem—from exchanges to banks. Through initiatives like Project Guardian, Canada is fostering industry-wide cooperation to disrupt illicit financial flows tied to opioids. A stronger emphasis on education and compliance is paving the way for a more transparent and accountable crypto landscape.

Time will tell if such measures can effectively curb money laundering while maintaining the integrity of Canada’s financial system. What remains clear, though, is that regulators are watching closely.

I have the following problem. I measured fractions of the same samples twice for microplastic (MP) content. Once with Py-GC-MS and once via IR-microscopy. The results differ drastically. I have a total of 16 samples measured this way. 

My first impulse was to plot them against each other and check for regression. R² values are terrible (0 - 0.2). So there is no regression whatsoever. 

I want to check if the the test results could be from the same population by comparing the variances, means and so on. However I do not know, what test to use. One problem: The test yield very different results: Py-GC-MS will result in a mass/mass concentration and the microscopy will result in particle number/mass. 

Additionally I am not sure if normality within the population can be assumed, for there is very little (nearly zero) data available on this topic in the literature.

Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance."

Verification typically involves providing your full name, date of birth, and the last four digits of your Social Security Number (SSN).

**Business Accounts**  
Tailored for small business owners, Business accounts facilitate transactions between businesses and customers. They offer features like:

* Built-in tax reporting.
* The ability to accept payments from customers.
* However, Business accounts incur a 2.75% fee on all incoming transactions.

**Key Differences**

* **Fees:** Personal accounts are free to use, while Business accounts charge a 2.75% fee on incoming payments.
* **Features:** Business accounts include tax reporting tools, which are not available in Personal accounts.
* **Verification:** Both account types require verification to access higher transaction limits and additional features.

Choosing the right account type depends on your specific needs—whether you’re managing personal finances or running a business.

# Is Cash App safe to use?

Cash App is a popular peer-to-peer payment service that allows users to send and receive money, invest in stocks and bitcoin, and access banking features. While it offers convenience, it’s important to understand its safety aspects.

**Security Measures**  
Cash App employs encryption and fraud detection technologies to protect user data and funds. It is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Level 1, the highest level of certification for payment processors.

**User Responsibilities**  
Despite these measures, Cash App lacks certain protections. For instance, funds stored in Cash App are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), except for users with a Cash Card, which offers FDIC insurance up to $250,000.

**Best Practices for Safety**

* **Enable Security Lock:** Use a PIN or biometric authentication to access your account.
* **Verify Recipients:** Double-check the recipient’s details before sending money.
* **Avoid Sharing Personal Information:** Do not disclose your sign-in code, PIN, or other sensitive information.
* **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly review your transaction history for any unauthorized activity.

While Cash App provides a convenient platform for financial transactions, users must exercise caution and adhere to security best practices to protect their funds and personal information.

# Best Practices For Using Verified Cash App Accounts?

Ensuring the security of your [Cash App account](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-verified-cash-app-accounts/) is crucial for safe transactions. Here are some best practices to follow:

* **Verify Your Account** Completing the verification process unlocks higher transaction limits and additional features. You’ll need to provide your full name, date of birth, and the last four digits of your Social Security Number. In some cases, Cash App may request your full SSN, residential address, unexpired government-issued photo ID, and/or income verification.
* **Protect Sensitive Information** Be cautious of unsolicited requests for your sign-in code, PIN, or Social Security Number. Cash App will never ask for this information over the phone, on social media, or through any other medium.
* **Recognize and Avoid Scams** Scammers may promise to “flip” your money or offer deals that seem too good to be true. Always verify the recipient’s information before sending money. If someone says something sounds too good to be true, chances are that it’s a scam.
* **Enable Security Features** Activate the Security Lock setting so that every Cash App payment requires your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. Also, enable notifications via text message or email to be alerted after every transaction.
* **Secure Your Mobile Device** Set a passcode for your device to prevent unauthorized access. Regularly update your device’s operating system to benefit from the latest security patches.
* **Monitor Your Transactions** Regularly review your transaction history for any unauthorized or suspicious activity. If you notice anything unusual, report it to Cash App Support immediately.
* **Use Strong, Unique Passwords** Create a strong password for your Cash App account and avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to keep track of your passwords securely. By following these practices, you can enhance the security of your Cash App account and enjoy a safer transaction experience.

[Christine Barry | November 19, 2024](https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/11/19/secure-your-company-with-frameworks--functions--and-tiers)

The United States (U.S.) and other governments offer cybersecurity guidance that can be adapted for use by any type and size of organization. One of the best resources you could employ in your own security strategy is the cybersecurity framework developed by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST). NIST is an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce, and its mission is to ""promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness."" You can get [more details on the purpose and operations of NIST here](https://www.nist.gov/about-nist).

Some of the most important work developed by NIST are the frameworks that guide organizations in various aspects of cybersecurity and risk management. Risk management, privacy, artificial intelligence (AI), and secure software are all addressed in various frameworks. In this post we'll be looking at the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and how it can help you defend your company.

# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and functions

The NIST CSF 1.0 was released in 2014 and updated to CSF 1.1 in 2018. Four years later, NIST began the journey to CSF 2.0.

 

 

https://preview.redd.it/gz6kswz7i5fe1.png?width=1701&format=png&auto=webp&s=db392c0766d14f6ea37319a878fb8594218c49d1

CSF 2.0 Progression and Activities Timeline, Credit: [Kristina Rigopoulos](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/nists-journey-csf-20)

 

There are several steps to framework development, including the [request for public comments](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/request-information-about-evaluating-and-improving-cybersecurity-resources). These updates to the CSF recognize that cybersecurity and the threat landscape are always evolving, and the standards must keep up.

The NIST CSF outlines best practices to help companies decide where to focus their time and money on cybersecurity. According to NIST, the framework helps companies ""[better understand, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk and protect their networks and data](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/small-businesses/cybersecurity/nist-framework)."" NIST frameworks are intended to provide a comprehensive approach to managing and reducing the risk associated with the subject area. The CSF does this by defining six functions, or pillars, within the framework. The terms 'pillar' and 'function' are used interchangeably, so don't be surprised if you find them used inconsistently across various sources. NIST uses the term 'function,' which is what we are using here.

1. Govern: This function was added in [CSF 2.0](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/cswp/29/the-nist-cybersecurity-framework-csf-20/final) and focuses on cybersecurity governance and aligning with business objectives. This includes things like organizational context, cybersecurity supply chain risk management, oversight, and more. CSF 2.0 keeps the previous five pillars and cybersecurity objectives but broadens the scope of the framework. It also adds guidance on integration with other frameworks, like [privacy](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework) and [risk management](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf).
2. Identify: This function lays the groundwork for a comprehensive security strategy because it recognizes that you cannot protect what you don't know about. The cybersecurity landscape and risks must be understood before they can be managed. This piece of the framework is associated with asset management, business environment analysis, governance, risk assessment, and risk management strategy.
3. Protect: This piece of the framework helps companies understand how to deploy the defenses to prevent incidents and ensure the delivery of critical services. This function involves access control, awareness and training, data security, information protection processes and procedures, maintenance, and protective technology. Risk mitigation is based on the baselines established in the previous function.
4. Detect: This function ensures that cybersecurity events are discovered and identified in a timely manner. These events may be data breaches, malicious attacks, system failures, and employee mistakes that become insider threats. The work here involves continuous security monitoring, event detection processes, and the rapid identification of anomalies and cybersecurity events.
5. Respond: This function helps companies build action plans for response, mitigation, and business continuity. Rapid containment and resolution are the focus here. This function involves response planning, communications, analysis, and mitigation. These action plans are evaluated regularly and should improve over time as experience and new information are brought into the plan.
6. Recover: This is both a reactive and proactive function. The spotlight here is usually on restoring normal operations, ensuring business continuity, and patching, updating, or otherwise 'fixing things.' The proactive piece involves reviewing the incident and incorporating the lessons learned into the overall security strategy where appropriate. This after-action piece is not as urgent as the recovery, but it is just as important. This information will help the company close security gaps and strengthen its resilience against future attacks.

[NIST illustration](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf) representing the six functions of CSF 2.0

 

# CSF function tiers

Each of these functions has four implementation tiers that define the levels that an organization can achieve across the six functions of the CSF. These tiers help companies assess their cybersecurity practices and set goals for improvement. The tiers also address one of NIST's primary goals, which is to enable different industries and organizations to speak with a common language when it comes to standards and measurements. In this case, the tiers within each function of the CSF can be used to more accurately communicate the security posture of a company to stakeholders and other parties as needed.

Here's a brief look at the four tiers within each of the six functions:

* Tier 1: Partial, ad-hoc approaches that provide basic understanding and management of cybersecurity risk. There are limited controls and governance practices in place, but there is initial awareness of the company's security risk.
* Tier 2: Risk-informed, but inconsistent practices and controls. The company has greater risk awareness and prioritization at this level. Internal collaboration is inconsistent, but risk management practices are approved by management.
* Tier 3: Repeatable and defined processes are in place, and standardized controls are deployed and managed. The company has formal policies around cybersecurity that are regularly evaluated and updated based on changes in the threat landscape. There is consistent communication around cybersecurity and risk management.
* Tier 4: Adaptive and highly-integrated security practices are deployed throughout the company and are continuously improved through feedback loops. This level describes a company with a culture of security awareness that supports a proactive and collaborative approach to risk management.

Let's illustrate the differences in these tiers by looking at the email security technologies you might find at each level:

* Tier 1:  Basic spam filtering that protects users from messages that are obvious spam.
* Tier 2:  Anti-phishing solutions that detect more sophisticated email threats.
* Tier 3:  A secure email gateway (SEG) that provides comprehensive email protection.
* Tier 4:  Advanced solutions with artificial intelligence (AI) that defend against advanced and emerging threats.

That's a basic example that shows how the security solutions and services progress through the tiers. The Tier 4 organization is the most proactive, adaptive, and leadership-oriented in its approach to cybersecurity.

A [Twitter account](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-twitter-accounts/) is an individual user profile on the social media platform, Twitter. It allows users to post short messages known as Tweets, share multimedia contents and contact others. A Twitter account also serves as the foundation for users to engage with other Twitter accounts, whether personal or professional.

To create a Twitter account, you need a valid email address, a username (known as a Twitter handle), and a secure password. Once your account is set up, you can customize your profile by adding a profile picture, bio, and a header image. Twitter accounts enable users to follow others, receive updates in their feeds, and be notified of interactions such as retweets, likes, and replies.

**Introduction**  
In the ever-evolving digital landscape, Twitter accounts stand as one of the most influential and widely used forms of social media communication. Whether you are a casual user, a business, or a public figure, your Twitter account serves as a digital identity, allowing you to connect with millions of users globally. But what exactly is a Twitter account, and how do its features enhance communication? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Twitter accounts, including their creation, functionalities, and significance in the digital world.

# Why Are Twitter Old Accounts Important?

In the ever-changing world of social media, [Twitter](https://x.com/) has remained one of the most influential platforms for individuals, brands, and even political movements. As the platform has evolved, many have begun to recognize the significance of older Twitter accounts. While new users flood the platform every day, there’s something uniquely valuable about accounts that have been active for a long time. But why are these accounts so important? In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the growing relevance of old Twitter accounts and why they continue to hold significant weight.

**Increased Credibility and Trust**  
One of the most significant advantages of owning an older Twitter account is the trust and credibility it comes with. A long-established account is often seen as more reliable and genuine compared to newly created ones. This perception of authenticity can be crucial, especially when trying to build a personal brand or establish a professional presence. Followers tend to trust accounts that have a history of consistent posting and interaction, which makes older accounts more valuable in terms of establishing long-term relationships with followers.

**Established Audience and Following**  
[Older Twitter accounts](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-twitter-accounts/) tend to have a more substantial and more engaged following compared to newer ones. Over the years, as an account consistently produces quality content, it naturally attracts followers. These followers are more likely to trust the account, engage with posts, and amplify the content through retweets and likes. Additionally, older accounts have likely built strong networks, which can be leveraged to create even more opportunities for growth.

**Access to Historical Data**  
Another reason why old Twitter accounts are valuable is the treasure trove of historical data they hold. With years of tweets, interactions, and conversations, these accounts offer a comprehensive view of user behavior over time. This historical data can be used to analyze trends, measure engagement, and even refine content strategies. For businesses, this kind of data is invaluable for crafting targeted marketing campaigns or identifying consumer preferences.

**Higher Organic Reach and Visibility**  
Old Twitter accounts benefit from a higher organic reach due to the platform’s algorithm favoring accounts that have been active for longer periods. Twitter’s algorithm tends to promote content from accounts that have consistently engaged with users, built an audience, and contributed to the platform over time. This gives older accounts a natural advantage in terms of visibility, making it easier for their tweets to show up on users’ timelines, even without paid promotions.

**SEO and Social Proof**  
When it comes to SEO (Search Engine Optimization), older Twitter accounts are more likely to show up in search results. Search engines like Google take into account the age and authority of a social media profile when determining its ranking. Older Twitter accounts that have garnered engagement over time will likely appear higher in search results, increasing the chances of attracting new followers and visitors. Moreover, the social proof provided by having a long-standing account with a history of positive engagement can make the account seem more influential, further boosting its credibility.

**Enhanced Brand Authority**  
For businesses or individuals looking to build a personal or corporate brand, having an old Twitter account can significantly contribute to brand authority. An older account signals that the brand or individual has experience, expertise, and longevity in their respective field. This can help attract new business opportunities, partnerships, and collaborations. Many people tend to associate the age of an account with the success or authority of the individual or business behind it, making old Twitter accounts highly valuable for branding efforts.

**Final Thoughts**  
Twitter accounts hold undeniable importance for individuals and businesses alike. Their value lies not only in the credibility and influence they’ve built over time but also in the ability to leverage their history, followers, and data to maximize reach and engagement. Whether you’re looking to build a personal brand, promote a business, or simply enjoy the nostalgia of an older account, there are many reasons why keeping your old Twitter account active is worth the effort. As Twitter continues to evolve, these accounts will remain a vital part of the platform’s ecosystem, and their value will only increase with time.

What's going on with GX? Why is it so slow now?,OperaGX,1i9oa0e,2025-01-25 09:38:34,6,0.88,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OperaGX/comments/1i9oa0e/whats_going_on_with_gx_why_is_it_so_slow_now/,TailaBlu,SUPPORT,"Hey, I really hope I’m not just the typical broken record here. A lot of people are unsatisfied with this update, and unfortunately I am one of them. I’ve loved this browser for years now, and have been using it religiously despite protests from my more security-and-privacy oriented friends. I just love all of its features, from the sounds it makes to the ability to customize everything about it.

Following the latest update, I’ve come to the startling realization that it just... isn’t as optimized as it used to be? Some websites take a very long time to load, whereas they used to take very little time at all. I’ve done some of everything to try to figure out why it’s like this now. I’ve even used some of the more commonly suggested solutions that worked for others.

Solution 1: The actual honest-to-god feature of switching back to the old UI (genuinely brilliant, thank you Opera, even if it isn’t working properly for me). I genuinely tried this first, since I’m not really the type of person to ignore obvious solutions just to get mad at something. It didn’t work at all, strangely enough. During the time where I was holding back from reinstallation, I kept trying to toggle this and it never - not once - went back to the old UI. Which meant I had to try...

Solution 2: Reinstallation. It did not work. I still have the issues with Opera GX that I had in the first place. I made sure to try it without user data being deleted first, and then followed the second attempt with the deletion of all user data. It’s still got the problems, sadly.

Solution 3: Clearing of cache. I did this before I tried the reinstallation, and after I tried the reinstallation. It’s still stalling REALLY HARD on certain webpages.

Solution 4: Moving to a different browser. This isn’t so much a solution as it is switching to something else until the issues get patched. I’m going to be using a different browser until someone tells me the loading issues have gotten fixed. And this is a genuine request for an update, I’m going to be missing Opera GX for a long time.

I don’t really get why this is happening. Opera GX is meant to be “the gaming browser”, but for some reason opening it up heats up my laptop an awful amount now, and it takes one minute and ten seconds (1:10) to get on Youtube. Comparing this to when it used to be instant, that’s wild. Like... What happened??

Even the settings takes a very long time to load, which is really odd because before this rebrand and UI/UX upgrade, it really loaded up quickly. Everything Opera GX USED TO BE gave me the impression it was a very well put together and optimized browser, and now it just isn’t.

I’ve moved over to Vivaldi for now since I really like the customization options and getting to feel like I’m in control of how it looks. But... I still long for Opera GX. I’m doing my best here, what’s gone wrong and how come I can’t fix it? Does Opera know about the loading issues? I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, and each time I indicated the issues that made me uninstall. I reinstalled to measure how long it takes me to get to Youtube on my computer’s stopwatch, and soon I’ll be uninstalling and informing Opera of the issues again as I do.

Thanks for reading this, and thank you for any advice you can think of to give me."

# Why Should You Buy Google Ads Account?

[Buying a Google Ads account](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-google-ads-account/) can be an attractive option for businesses looking to fast-track their online advertising efforts. However, there are several important considerations and potential benefits to understand before purchasing one. Here’s why some businesses opt for buying a Google Ads account:

* **Instant Access to an Established Account** Buying a Google Ads account that is already established can save time. Instead of setting up a new account from scratch and waiting for it to gain trust and credibility with Google, purchasing an established account allows businesses to start advertising immediately. This can be especially useful if you’re aiming for quicker results.
* **Improved Account History and Reputation** Google rewards accounts with a positive history. When you purchase an account with a good performance track record (e.g., high-quality ads, positive metrics, and high customer engagement), your campaigns may benefit from an established reputation. A strong account history can improve your ad performance and potentially lower your cost-per-click (CPC) and cost-per-acquisition (CPA).
* **Better Ad Performance** Some businesses buy Google Ads accounts because older, well-established accounts tend to have more favorable metrics, such as a higher Quality Score.
* A higher Quality Score can lead to better Google Ads placement, higher visibility, and lower costs. This is because Google values relevancy and performance in determining where and how ads are shown.
* **Avoiding New Account Restrictions** Newly created [Google Ads accounts](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-google-ads-account/) may face restrictions, limitations, or delays in ad approval processes. By purchasing an established account, businesses can bypass these initial hurdles, as Google tends to scrutinize new accounts more closely to prevent fraud and misuse.
* **Access to Historical Data** An established account will already have historical data and insights, which can be valuable for future campaigns. This data can help you better understand customer behavior, identify trends, and refine your ad targeting strategies. With a new account, it could take months to accumulate this kind of valuable data.
* **Quicker Setup for International or Niche Markets** If you’re targeting international markets or specific niches, buying an account that is already set up for those markets may offer an advantage. For example, an account set up for international ad campaigns may already have the appropriate billing, language settings, and targeting preferences configured, saving you the hassle of doing this from scratch.

# Benefits of Verified Google Ads Account?

Having a verified Google Ads account offers several key benefits that can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your online advertising efforts. Here are some of the best convenience:

* **Increased Credibility and Trust** A [verified Google Ads account](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-google-ads-account/) helps establish trust with your audience and Google. When your account is verified, users are more likely to trust your ads and click on them, as verification signals legitimacy. It reduces concerns about scams and fraud, which can be common in the online advertising space.
* **Improved Ad Performance** Verified accounts are typically given more access to advanced features within Google Ads. This means you can access higher-quality targeting options, more refined audience segmentation, and advanced reporting tools, all of which can help improve your ad performance.
* **Enhanced Ad Targeting** Verification may unlock additional options for targeting specific geographic areas, demographics, and interests. This allows for more precise and relevant targeting, which can drive better ROI for your campaigns.
* **Increased Campaign Visibility** A verified Google Ads account is less likely to face issues with account suspension or restriction, which can hinder your campaign visibility. With a clean record, your ads are more likely to show up without delay, leading to more exposure for your business.
* **Higher Quality Score** Google uses Quality Score to measure the relevance of your Verified Google Ads, keywords, and landing pages. Verified accounts with a strong history of performance tend to have better Quality Scores, which can result in lower cost-per-click (CPC) and improved ad placement.
* **Access to Exclusive Features** Google may provide verified accounts with access to beta features or new tools before they are released to the public. This can give you a competitive edge by allowing you to test new strategies and capabilities that could improve your campaigns.
* **Better Account Management** For businesses running multiple campaigns or managing several accounts, a verified Google Ads account ensures smoother management. Google is more likely to offer dedicated support, which can help resolve issues faster and ensure that your ads are running optimally.
* **Fewer Restrictions on Payments** Verified [accounts](https://usaitsell.com/product-category/accounts-service/) can have fewer restrictions on payment methods, account limits, and billing. This makes it easier to scale your campaigns, manage budgets, and ensure consistent ad delivery without interruptions due to payment verification issues.
* **Access to Google Support** Verified accounts are often eligible for enhanced customer support, including live chat or dedicated account managers. This can be especially helpful if you face technical challenges or need advice on improving your campaigns.
* **Better Transparency and Reporting** Verification ensures that you get more accurate data and detailed reports about your ad performance, conversions, and other metrics. This transparency helps in making informed decisions about your ad strategy and budget allocation.
