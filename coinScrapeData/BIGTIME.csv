falling into the foxhole with you,letters,1i9xew1,2025-01-25 16:22:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1i9xew1/falling_into_the_foxhole_with_you/,Fragrant_Ad_5297,Lovers,"i am lying on the floor of my room and imagining a life, gentle and whole.

we wake up together and the light filters in soft and golden. we wake with no alarms, and the sun is the only clock. we drink tea because it feels like holding a small piece of warmth between us. there’s no rush, and i rinse the cups with my hands under slow water. when i kiss you, my lips taste like sugar. we shower because the water feels like forgiveness, and the soap smells like sweet cream and rain, but mostly it just smells like you.

we make eggs, or toast, or nothing at all. but today it’s pancakes and we don’t rush. i tell you about the dream i had where we were flowers in the same field, and you say you’d grow next to me in any life. there is no noise except us, we are enough. folding clothes doesn’t hurt, the empty rooms don’t ache. my body is still and i don’t feel broken. your shoulders don’t carry too much, and when they do, we let them rest. when the day feels heavy, we just let it.

there’s time for everything. time to sit in the sun, time to lay in the quiet, time to touch and laugh and cry if we need to. the world feels smaller in the best way, like it’s only as big as we want it to be."

He never asks for anything and always says ""I'll be happy with whatever mom"" (i seriously have some AMAZING kids). So me, thinking I still had his account stored in my phone from the last time we put Roblux on his acct, was like, I'm gonna surprise him and put some Roblux on his acct to randomly surprise him.

Yesterday he came home upset because someone took his big gummy bear the bus driver gave him for his birthday, like he was absolutely devastated.

 A little bit more back story, we just lost his grandpa 10/26/2024 he had colon cancer he had been fighting since the day i literally took my NCLEX in 2019, and my uncle from my mom's side made all the kids little dinosaur keychains alto give out to them at the memorial. The next day a little prick, sorry that's how I feel, ripped them off my kids back packs and destroyed them. Both of my kids I would say have high emotional and mental intelligence and it hurt both of them deeply that someone would take something that's a memory and destroy it. 

Believe me, we want more than anything to change school districts, but right now we've been struggling because I've missed ALOT of work to help take care of my dad closer to the end... It was rather... Traumatic. Even as a nurse, it's different when it's your loved one.... Not to say I don't feel sad when others pass away, but this is a pain i was not expecting... 

Sooooooooo, we are currently working on getting our house out of foreclosure, which honestly we are sooooo close!!!! 

There's more, but longer story short, my kiddos have been through alot and I was just trying to surprise him with some Roblux for his birthday and I locked him out of his account. I've tried the email password resets, but they send me to an alternative acct he made a few years ago with a username he didn't like at the time. His main acct i can't get access too. If anyone could point me in the right direction, I would be SUUUUUUPPERRR appreciative!!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
A Lesson in Cold Hardiness,sanpedrocactus,1i9xe4g,2025-01-25 16:21:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xe4g,GoodManFarson,Discussion ,"Hey everyone. I grow in some 7b in Richmond, Va and we just had a run of abnormally cold weather like most the rest of us in the US. I figured I’d share my experience with how my plants handled it in this big standard poly greenhouse from harbor freight. The highest is got over a 3 day stretch was 32, lowest ended up being 13 for a brief period, with two days in a row acutely below freezing for the entire time (see second picture).

The only modifiers I did to the greenhouse were adding a 50 gallon trash can full of water and a horticultural frost blanket over the collection; no heating of any kind.

As far as I can see I lost zero plants. It looks like I lost a grand total of four tips: Bruce’s dragon, 5 ft tall noid bridgesii, and two columns on my tbm b. There were light frost damage in the bodies/tips of I’d say roughly 25% of the collection. Most of them were small yearlings and generally small plants, most of them big boys (1 foot and up) did just fine. See pictures for the tip damage and general frost damage. None are detrimental and the plants will bounce back just fine.

As far as species went: bridgesii took the most damage; 90% of my scops and scop crosses were absolutely fine; my one pachanoi was fine; and all my Peru’s took no to very little visible damage.

Hopefully this gives some insight into how much you can push these plants in a very humble greenhouse over the winter. I know it’s been a common question for many people including myself over the years. I was slightly anxious about the whole thing, and I almost decided to buy a heater, but I was honestly curious about they would handle it (I also had faith since they handle lows of 15 degrees multiple times last winter).

Willing to hear everyone else’s experience with freezing temps and these plants! I think they are overall hardier than we think.

First experience w/ Jumpspeak (not great!),languagelearning,1i9xe27,2025-01-25 16:21:24,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1i9xe27/first_experience_w_jumpspeak_not_great/,shriramk,Discussion,"I recently learned about Jumpstart. I've used Duolingo, Mango, Pimsleur, etc. quite a bit in the past and I'm also using Duolingo now. I've been making my own LLM prompts to create lessons, and figured I was happy to outsource the job.

In my first half hour I'm already very disappointed by *many* things.

1. It seems very difficult to get a price up front from their Web site. That's always a bad sign.

2. When you click on buttons like ""Try 100 days"", you go through an extremely long, irritating, frustrating, sequence of questions and interactions, none of which seem to have any real value *at all*. For instance, after I did what seemed like a ""what is your level"" quiz (and did very well on), there was absolutely no feedback, nor was there any customization when I actually started using the app. It became clear that this is whole process is a bunch of crappy behavioral psychology tricks, not anything tied to learning.

3. After I initiated the payment process, I kept getting several ""upsell"" pages. After two of these I got really annoyed and bailed out of completing the signup process entirely. I even got an email from Jumpspeak: subject ""Can I help?"" and text:

> It looks like you were right in the middle of signing up for our special.
>
> But it appears you didn’t get a chance to finish the checkout process.

etc., with a link to ""fill out the order form and finish your order"" (which I had no intent of doing). But here's the kicker: even before I got this email, I got email from Jumpspeak *thanking me for my order*.

4. When you go to their [Customer Service Portal](https://jumpspeakapp.samcart.com/customer_hub/dashboard), you can *view* your subscription and you can update your card…you can't cancel it. To cancel you have to search in help, [find the relevant page](https://help.jumpspeak.com/article/5-how-to-cancel), then [go to another page](https://www.jumpspeak.com/billing), enter your email to get a magic link, and only then do you get to the billing site. It's safe to say they seem to be trying very hard to make it difficult to cancel. (This is also how I confirmed that I *am* set up to be billed, so I mashed that cancellation button so hard.) Anyway, for those who care, the current rate is ""$69.00 every 91 days"".

5. My ""100 day"" free trial begins on Jan 25 and ends on Apr 25, which… is… not 100 days?!?

Okay, these are the shenanigans *outside* the app! But since I was already registered (against my will!), I downloaded and started to run the app. This is for Italian.

- As noted above, there is nothing customized about it. It didn't seem to do anything with my quiz results to find the right level for me.

- All I go was a very scripted, pre-set set of lessons. Each lesson has has a Listen, Write, Speak, and Conversation mode, with a few prompts in each. It's no less scripted than Duolingo, but isn't even as diverse. The user interface is nowhere near as polished as that of Duolingo. Also, on the Write problems, early on, it gives you no ""distractors"" (wrong choices); I assume that changes after a while.

- There are some silly bugs in the software, like a place where it said something about ""continue to learn English"".

- On the audio (which I suspect is the part that is hardest to get right and most compute-intensive), the system would accept my answers *suspiciously* quickly. I then started to purposely make mistakes. The big ones it caught, small ones (like adding on extra words at the end) it didn't. Not sure how reliable that is.

I then noticed that there is a separate ""AI chat"" mode. Aha, finally, here we go! So I engaged that. There are some scenarios. I picked Travel Planning.

By default, it shows you a question *and* the desired answer. (You can configure a lot of things, presumably including this.) That doesn't seem too useful, but at the same time the question is too complicated to answer otherwise. So I'm not sure how to use this.

Anyway, I noticed it was…rather scripted here, too. So I started to say slightly incorrect things. It just seemed to get stuck asking the same question over and over. I then started to say nonsenical things. It still seemed sort of stuck on a script. Eventually it did show some signs of ""understanding"". But I think the experience here was worse than I'd have if I were typing into a chatbot directly.

BUT: to give it credit: when I ended the lesson, it gave me a score, and then gave feedback on each thing I'd said. The feedback was **pretty good**. *It is also the same as the feedback I've been able to get directly from chatbots* (unsurprisingly). What it didn't seem to be able to do was give any *contextual* feedback: e.g., ""what you said was grammatically correct, it just has nothing at all to do with *travel planning*, and was actually kinda' nonsensical and had nothing to do with my question!"".

I went back to try it again to see whether it would give me a rather different conversation. But from what I can tell, that exact button is … no longer there? This is weird: the whole point of using GenAI is that you can have the same conversation many times, somewhat different each time: e.g., before a trip, it can be useful to practice a dozen *different* food-ordering conversations. Is Jumpspeak removing the buttons after you've tried them once?

So overall, it's a very mixed bag. The signup experience is bad and feels very scammy. (Dear Jumpspeak lawyers: I'm not saying you *are* a scam, you're just…well.) The app is so-so if you take away the ""AI"". The AI part is…mixed so far.

My usual sentiment is to say ""hey, it's a new system, they're trying something interesting, let's see how this evolves"". But the signup process left a poor taste in my mouth, *especially* my not even completing the sign-up — not just in my imagination, but even getting email from them about it! — and then them going ahead and billing me anyway? This is no way to build trust."
Favorite musings in ENO,eno,1i9xe0j,2025-01-25 16:21:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/eno/comments/1i9xe0j/favorite_musings_in_eno/,cferrari22,,"Watching Eno, there were so many cool ideas and insights into his body of work, but I especially appreciated some of the “big ideas”. These were nice reminders for me on what happened to be my first day of retirement. Here are my favorites paraphrased, what are yours?

* (musing on why we like music, why some notes feel right together)…Music gives us a sense of being synchronized, with being part of something bigger; it satisfies that very human need.
* Sex, drugs, art, and religion are the times we most often surrender ourselves, and actually enjoy letting go of our egos. He suggested rethinking surrender as a strategy that one can use in creating art.
* As an artist, he is challenged every morning to decide “what am I going to do today? Of all the things in the world, what am I going to do?” Lunch is high on his list :)
* Art creates a situation where people can have feelings and examine them. That's enough.
* Each person is like a modem in a vast network of brains, and depends on everyone else’s expertise. He believes art can bridge that gap, both vertically and horizontally. We can share art, horizontally, such as in a concert, or vertically, such as when we read something and do something else with that knowledge."

Instead of putting all this time and energy into freaking out over trans people using bathrooms, they could be putting all of that energy into putting in proper stall doors that don't have a gap big enough to put your hand through and actually lock. Using public bathrooms makes me so uncomfortable and it has literally nothing to do with who's in there. It has to do with there being basically no privacy because the stalls might as well be made of glass for how many places you can see in. Please get your priorities straight transphobes. "

I can set it up in 10 seconds.  [Here's a video of how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb5MJMPWHjk&ab_channel=%ED%94%84%EB%9D%BC%EC%9A%B0%EB%93%9C%EB%B9%84%EB%87%A8%EA%B8%B0%EA%B3%BC). 

I've seen videos of the autoinjector devices that they sell in the west, and it seems incredibly big,  fumbly, and time-consuming to set up.  This pen from Korea is just ingenious.  In the past, I've been injecting freehand with a syringe, but after trying this pen, I could never go back.

I want my mom,UnsentLetters,1i9xcgo,2025-01-25 16:19:30,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i9xcgo/i_want_my_mom/,Spiritual_Stranger53,Family,"It never goes away, you know. The hole in my heart, where you should be. My twentieth birthday is in two weeks. I wish you were here. 

There’s nothing I could say to make you care. About me, about yourself, about our family. I don’t know how to grieve you, because you’re still alive. I don’t know how to grieve you, because I still have hope that one day you’ll get the help that you need. I don’t know how to grieve you, because deep down, I still want you to be my mom. 

But you never were a mom. You gave birth to me. And then you tortured me. You used me as a way to get people to do what you wanted them to. I was only ever an accessory to you, and besides, I raised myself. I don’t need you. Maybe I did once. But I haven’t for a long, long time. 

That doesn’t mean I don’t miss the thought of you. I still love you. Every time I’m sad, all I want is a hug from you. Even though I know that’ll never happen. You ruined each and every one of my birthdays growing up, but I still get excited for them.

This is my 3rd birthday away from you. The last two were the best of my life. For my 17th birthday, I went to dinner with my friends. For my 18th birthday, I went on a short trip. For my 19th birthday, I went on a walk. You haven’t wished me happy birthday in years. To be fair, I haven’t wished you any happy birthdays either. The revengeful part of me hopes you don’t have any. The realist part of me knows that you don’t, but also that it doesn’t really bring me any solace knowing that you’re miserable.


This year, I’ll be spending my birthday on my own. I have no friends here. The only person I know at this point is grandma. So I’ll be spending my 20th birthday playing board games and eating sugar-free pecan pie with my grandmother. 

I still wish you were here. Will you even think of me on my birthday? Will you try to call? You didn’t before. But it’s a big one…double decade… I doubt you will. I’d be willing to bet my next paycheque on it.

I want my mom. I want A mom. Or a hug. Or both. But I’ll end up with neither, as per usual.

I never knew what you were like before I was born. All our family tells me you weren’t always like this. Like a switched flipped in you, or something. But this is all I ever saw from you. I don’t know any other version of you. To me, you’ve always been cruel. I still wish you’d care. Or try to, at least. 

Anyways. I wish you would get help. That’s my one and only birthday wish. It’s been my one and only birthday wish for as long as I can remember. Your family loves you, still. I love you. Still. 

Sincerely, your only daughter.

What do you think they’d change?",FinalFantasyVIII,1i9xc33,2025-01-25 16:19:04,5,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xc33,TheGreatKashar,,"Personally speaking, even though I love the FF7 Remake games, I really don’t think they needed to split FF7’s story and world into 3 30-40 hour long segments. A lot of what was added is nice, but comes off like killing time and trying to justify its own length.

I think that just taking what the original FF8 had to offer and making big important moments like the Dollet Mission, Abducting the President, Edea’s assassination, and The Garden Battle in a modern style really would be enough to satisfy the fans. 

Imagine, seamlessly going into battles against characters as the crazy Garden on Garden conflict happens all around you. Or running through the city as the giant spider Mech chases you. I think fans of the original would be more than happy with that."

Dating after the end of a long term relationship,AskWomenOver30,1i9xbj7,2025-01-25 16:18:22,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1i9xbj7/dating_after_the_end_of_a_long_term_relationship/,Any-Hall4444,Romance/Relationships,"I could really use some advice. I am 31 years old. My relationship of 12 years fell apart 8 months ago. He was my person and I still think he is. 
At the beginning of 2023 he was depressed (in hind sight I would have to say it started about 6 months prior to that). He directed a lot of his hurt and anger at me. 
In February of 2023 I lost my mom suddenly and tragically and it broke me. Completely broken and I will be picking up the pieces for the rest of my life as I decide what this world looks like for me without my mom in it. It’s still pretty dark. Coming up on 2 years without her and it still feels like a terrible dream I need to wake up from. 
He couldn’t be there for me. It was too much for him and in my grief I could not help him or show him or guide him any more than I felt I was already doing (telling him what I needed from him in specific moments and asking him just to be there in my sadness with me) 
I finally came out of the fog enough to see how broken we really seemed and I broke up with him. Next to existing in this world without my mom, that is the hardest thing I ever had to do. He moved out and got his own place and I think that broke him, and he was finally able to see all the hurt and pain he caused once he stepped back from everything. He has been in therapy since last summer, he’s reading self help and grief related books and he has thanked me for ending things because he sees many errors of his ways and he wants to do right by me. He says he’s dating people but I don’t think he is. We haven’t blocked each other on socials and he will occasionally check in with me. I miss him immensely. I miss who he was and what we had before depression hit and my world fell apart. I am considering rekindling things with him which will involve couples therapy and for sure living apart for the next 6 months. I wouldn’t want to jump back in, my heart is very cautious for when the next terrible thing happens and how we would navigate that now. 
So recently I’ve jumped into the dating game. I thought maybe I should meet new people and see what else is out there for me. I tried speed dating and connected with a few people. I have some dates planned and I went out with a really nice guy this afternoon. He was charming and sweet and I even kissed him at the end of the date and decided that I don’t like him at all. There was no spark/deep attraction or pull to him in any way. I was ready for the date to end. So onto my asking for advice, I need other people’s opinions and perspectives because I feel like I’m going crazy. I just was picturing my ex the whole time and how much fun we would have and how deep we would get in conversation (I know that’s happened over time) but is this what it is? Dating I mean? Do I go back to the man who hurt me with his words when I know he was sick and hurting at the time too? He’s actually doing all of the work and making big changes in his life. Do I start something with someone new? My head is all over the place and I could really use some perspectives. I don’t have a lot of girl friends and my best friend lives in another time zone. What do you think? Thank you for taking the time to read this. "
Normal teenager sleep behavior vs narcolepsy as a teen?,Narcolepsy,1i9xbeo,2025-01-25 16:18:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1i9xbeo/normal_teenager_sleep_behavior_vs_narcolepsy_as_a/,thestupiddummy,Advice Request,"Hey all, I’m diagnosed with N1 and having growing concerns about my 13 year old based on some things he’s reported to me/I’ve observed and I’m just looking for some perspective on normal teenager sleep behaviors vs having narcolepsy as a teen? 

TLDR at the bottom!!!

I know it’s common for narcolepsy to present in the early-mid teenage years but I also know this is an age when the circadian rhythms and sleep habits are changing for everyone, narcolepsy or not, with puberty etc. I’m trying hard not to be a hypochondriac and see my experiences in him when they aren’t actually there but it’s also hard to assess because I don’t know what normal is and/or if my experience as a teen was normal or not but I didn’t get diagnosed until well into adulthood. 

Some of his sleep highlights if you’re interested:
- Fell asleep at a restaurant during a big group lunch while waiting for food and slept through people talking, kids playing, people trying to wake him to eat, walk to the car afterwards etc.

- Extremely difficult to wake for school in the mornings, requires multiple attempts every day (like up to an hour of attempts sometimes) and then will often still fall back asleep on the floor while getting ready (sometimes several times on the floor in different spots) OR he will be upset when I finally get him to wake up for reals saying that no he already woke up and got ready. So many late tardy mornings that we are on the truancy officers watch list. 

- Will hear me talking while he’s asleep and dreaming and reply to me out loud but with a reply that only makes sense in the context of his dream.

- Will wake up and talk to me coherently in real life and then fall back asleep and continue his dream from before waking up. Sometimes multiple times he can wake up, be coherent and then go back into the same dream and control what things happen in the dream.

- Or he can stay asleep in the dream and talk to me in real life too and then tell me about his dream while he’s asleep in his dream

- He often has sort of zone out moments when he’s talking where he’ll often look off and just stop talking in the middle of his sentence like he needs to think for a bit about what he’s going to say and pauses for a second or three until you prompt him and then it’s like he remembers that he needs to finish his sentence and he will continue where he left off 

- He cut his finger on a saw in woodshop and told me that he didn’t realize how fast the wood was being cut or that his finger was that close to the blade until after his finger was already cut. I asked him if he thought he fell asleep for a second and he said no but idk? microsleeps can be tricky and the apparently delayed reaction time is concerning. 

- He hasn’t started taking naps after school but he does seem to have diminished energy and has started wanting to skip many of his evening athletic activities. 

- But on the flip side he can easily stay up until 1-2 am some nights like he’s just not tired at all. Like his brain just has the “be awake now” switch fully on. It has always been difficult for his mind to settle down for sleep at night (thank you ADHD) but this crazy insomnia is new. (It’s also something I experience and something that had me convinced for a long time that I couldn’t have narcolepsy….and then the tendency to blame the poor mornings on staying up too late even if they don’t actually coincide. 

Bonus anecdotes that concern me for cataplexy: 
- He fell off the edge of my bed when I made him laugh unexpectedly once while he was balancing there on his knees. Like a wet noodle folding he just went from balancing on his perch to a puddle on the floor in a hot second. 
- I’ve seen him drop his arms and/or head when laughing before and/or have trouble remaining upright (but not fully collapse)…he kinda looks like a wet noodle for a second or so but it’s generally been so brief that I always end up questioning myself. 
- While showing me a funny video he had already seen when the anticipation was building for the punchline he told me that his arms were tingling. Apparently this has happened several times and sometimes it’s just a part of his arms or the hands but other times it’s the whole arm

TLDR: I do plan to speak with his pediatrician but I also want to have appropriate expectations so I’m curious: What is your personal experience with sleep as a teenager? What is a normal experience vs an abnormal/narcoleptic experience at this age based on your experiences as a teenager or parenting a teenager? Thank you!

"Hey guys, so with all the confusion going around, I would like to bring my analysis of the trailer (this is also available on the Fandom page). Please note that this is just based off of what has been noticed in the trailer so far.",PoppyPlaytime,1i9xbca,2025-01-25 16:18:08,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoppyPlaytime/comments/1i9xbca/hey_guys_so_with_all_the_confusion_going_around_i/,jthesmg4fan,Gameplay Trailer Analysis,"The trailer starts off with the theme of the new character’s commercial. It eventually fades into screams and a siren blaring. Dough starts dripping down from the ceiling, before cutting to a black screen where Poppy Playtime tells The Player that this is “unlike anything you’ve seen above. It’s hell.”

It cuts to a shot of a prison area, likely the one teased in The Doctor cinematic trailer. It then cuts to a scene, likely also in the prison area, where a door closes as Poppy states that Playtime wanted it to be hell as the doors close completely.

Harley Sawyer, using a Playtime Automated Companion TV, curiously asks “What’s this?” referring to The Player before they then fall backwards. We then cut to the trash pile area seen in the Chapter 4 Teaser Trailer, with the new character talking about how Harley, nicknamed “the Doctor“ works directly under the Prototype and controls this part of the factory. As he says “Hunting us,” a shot of The Player trapped in a cage as Yarnaby passes by pops up, before cutting to a shot of a painting with the words “SAFE HAVEN” written above a picture of hands protecting colorful little people.

Harley then states that there are no places to hide, not from him, as a shot of The Player in a power room of sorts while Yarnaby, now massive, stalks them, potentially meaning that Yarnaby will grow either bigger or smaller over the course of the game. It also reveals that there are multiple bodies for Harley, meaning he probably won’t go down as easily. A mystery character says that he has “something special in mind.” This plays over a shot of Poppy and Kissy Missy, potentially revealing that she is alive.

Poppy states that “we need to make this right,” as Harley waves at The Player before The Player falls down the stairs. It then cuts to a shot of The Player shining a light on one of Harley’s bodies, having an arm out. This could potentially mean that the Weeping Angel mechanic used for Miss Delight could return. It then cuts to a shot of the Nightmare Critters attacking The Player as they fend them off using the the orange hand.

It cuts to a tattered and cluttered room presumably full of skeletons (or Harley’s bodies), before then switching to a shot where a door opens behind a desk as Harley says “Let’s make a game of you.” Another shot of the Nightmare Critters, this time in a more cinematic angle appears, before quickly cutting to Kissy banging on a door with The Player behind them, as Poppy begs whoever’s in that room to hurry and let them in, revealing that Kissy Missy is most definitely alive.

Pianosaurus, keys playing, then runs towards the camera before Ollie yells “He’s outside!” The new character states that they have failed you, before a very big Baba Chops jumps towards The Player. As Yarnaby, now smaller than the last time we’ve seen him and his mouth wide open similar to one of the screenshots revealed about a day before the trailer released, runs towards The Player, Poppy yells “You lied to me!” to an unknown character, likely Harley. A shot of TVs, turning on with the eye of Harley Sawyer appears as a door in that room opens.

We finally cut to a continuation of the first scene with the alarm still going in the background, dough dripping more and more down the ceiling, eventually cascading down, forming a new character. This new character, placing a hat on his head, is revealed to be the heavily teased Doey the Doughman, as he greets the Player as “Pal,” before asking them to follow him. His face seems to downturn after he says this.

The trailer then cuts to black as the Chapter 4 logo, glitching in and out as it is formed by dough, appears, the words “Safe Haven” appearing below it as the entire logo becomes gray. It then cuts to the release date of January 30th, 2025, confirming that the game is not delayed. The trailer then ends."

"The ""older bottom x younger top"" age gap trope talk is necessary when it influences the dynamic that the characters has & is pulled off well😂😋",boyslove,1i9xanz,2025-01-25 16:17:16,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xanz,smittenkittyyan,Discussion,"Tonight, i decided to have fun by highlighting one of the old yaoi tropes that i always enjoyed. Some old yaoi tropes, just like the one i will tackle in this post,  aren't usually talked about often because they tend to be more sensitive.

But as someone who enjoyed them since the beginning of time 😆😅😅😅😅. Most like, since the very beginning, my beginning of getting into BL, and enjoying them in all forms, being BL mangas, novels, anime, movies/series, i also want to talk about them in the cases when the tropes are cleverly written and depicted and creates really unique dynamics.

Fictional characters shouldn't affect our feelings IRL. They shouldn't have an impact on us personally and  we shouldn't compare the way they are written and depicted with how it can happen in real life  ( basically extending it to how it happens in real life) .

Having said that, i will highlight a few couples whose age gap made me enjoy their dynamic so much more.

I. Ming and Joe from My Stand In [ pic 2-4]. I started watching My Stand In recently and one thing that i always keep in mind while watching is that in the novel Ming is much more younger than Joe. There is almost a ten years age gap between them in the novel, which is  reflected in the dynamic that the characters has in the beginning and at the end of the series.

 I was able to be much more lenient towards Ming because of how young he is in the beginning, combined with his superficial and extravagant lifesfyle. His lack of experience, the way he learns what matters the most to him after he end up losing it,   and the way he desperately tries to change his ways in order to not lose it again made me want to root for him. I am happy the series adaptation didn't totally removed this when they adapted the story. I know the characters don't look like they have such a big age difference physical wise in the series, but i can still perceive it because of the big age gap that the characters have maturity wise, with Joe being much more mature, independent and dependable than Ming. 😍

A good age gap exploration can lead to a better character growth and relationship development because of the power imbalance that tends to be present in the beginning and needs to be corrected little by little in time and i love the way this aspect was handled in My stand in 😍

For those of you who loves My stand in, you might love Beloved Enemy, a censored chinese bromance adaptation. The characters have a really similar dynamic there too. It's not wonder both series are adapted from a novel written by the same author 😁😆😅🤭.

II. Old Fashion Cupcake [pic 5-7]
One of the reason why i enjoyed OFC so much has to do with the age difference. 
This series doesn't only handles the older bottom and younger top trope, but the boss/employee trope too, which makes their relationship even more taboo in other people eyes. Yet, even with such a big age gap ( of about ten years as well) the actors has depicted one of the most touching and powerful love story. All the while making sure to convey the fact that the age difference and the boss/employee status was a hurdle that the characters has to keep in mind if they were to get together. It was brilliantly made.

III.The Pornographer franchise. Kijima and Kuzumi. [ pic 8-10]

It has been a while since i talked about them. I missed talking about them. See, this is one of the reasons why i want to start this series of tropes kind of post. It gives me a reason to talk about series  i wouldn't  usually talk about.

Their relationship worked because Kuzumi was pretry mature for his age from the beginning and was smitten by Kijima badly enough to wait for him to get over his shit and commit to him longterm once and for all.

IV. Minato's laundromat [ pic 11-12]

If only they explored the age gap better and only if they explored the characters with all their struggles better. 

I mostly enjoyed it thanks to it's older bottom and shorter top dynamic, the acting, good priduction quality, music and less because of the way the series is written.

V. Perfect Propose [ pic 13-15]

Hiro is about 6-7 years older than Kai in the manga, which plays into their dynamic, by Kai having to tiptoe on his toes around Kai in the beginning. The age gap makes his pursuit of Hiro not as smoothly as he wished and maybe not as smoothly as we wished, and i am glad they sticked to the manga when it comes to this.

VI. Unknown. [Pic 16-18].
If it weren't for my hopeless love towards the author of the novel ( Priest), my respect for the actors and the overall high quality production, i will seriously want to forget i watch it. Because the writing for the second half was horrendous 😮‍💨

VII. History: Make our days count- the second couple Sun Bo Xiang  and Lu Zhi Yang. [ pic 19]

Gonna be honest here. I think their dynamic worked mostly because of the chemistry between the actors and a good production team who was able to guide the actors well,  because the writing wasn't up to par.

VIII. Kiseki: dear to me [pic 20]. The main couple in this series isn't one of my favorite. I still like Chen Yi and Ai Di more, but they pulled the age gap well with the way it was handled 😍

Mr Mitsuya's planned feeding is another JBL with this trope that tackles it well and i personally recommend 😍

I want for us to have fun with this post. I want for you guys to recommend some more series with age gap that you personally liked or you think was handled well ?

For my next post, i am thinking to have it focus on the taller bottom x shorter top trope in order to talk about some of my favorites like Happy of the end and When it rains it pours. I can't wait to talk about the second couple of Jazz for two as well 🤭😍

Ines 101,TheFirstDescendant,1i9xabz,2025-01-25 16:16:51,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1i9xabz/ines_101/,VeeGeeTea,Build / Guide,"After countless hours of trial and errors, I've narrowed down to two builds that would be beneficial for you. This isn't an absolute MUST DO, and you're also free to modify to your play style.

Ines is a crit type character, by default her crit rate is high enough that it will trigger crit damage whenever you use one of her skills, however, you can also increase the crit rate to boost her damage multiplier from her passive skill perks.

The weapons of choice would be Secret Garden, as it buffs your Tech skill whenever you use it.  
EXCAVA is swapped, while you're waiting for your skills to recharge or you ran out of MP in the long run.  
Voltia is a required for many Void missions, it's the best blue/yellow shield buster weapon in the game.

Ines has one offensive red mod (Hunting Hounds) and one defensive red mod (Plasma Ball)

The first of which is for **\[Time of the Hunting Hounds\]** build, this is aimed to be a rapid fire with cooldown, banking on Ines passive perks:  
  
**\[Reactor\]**  
*Tech Mechanic Reactor*  
\+Tech  
\+Tactical | Automatic | Beam (Implant these three for all purpose play)  
\+Cooldown  
\+Cost

You can opt for +Tech and +Crit Dmg instead for the golden perks, instead of the above, should you need additional damage.

**\[Components\]**  
Farm for the *Hunter Set*, at two pieces, you'll get -4% Cooldown, and at four pieces, you'll get additional +0.12 MP Recovery (Combat), +1.03 MP Recovery (Non-Combat). Since Ines can generate MP at a chance when using her skills, this is a great component to have that would complement her.

*Hunter Auxiliary Power*  
Default: Max Shield  
Max HP  
MP Recovery Out of Combat or DBNO (Increase Timeout timer for when you're down)

*Hunter Sensor*  
Default: DEF (Damage Reduction)  
Max MP  
MP Recovery In Combat

*Hunter Memory*  
Default: Max Shield  
DEF (Damage Reduction)  
MP Recovery Modifier (Increase the MP multiplier)

*Hunter Processor*  
Default: Max HP  
Max Shield  
Shield Recovery Modifier or Toxic Resistance (look for this only if you need it vs Colossus)

Below are your character mods for the Hunter build:

**\[Descendant\]**  
*Time of the Hunting Hounds*  
This mod will turn all your skills to use Tech, and your 3rd skill will do 100m dash instead of shock punch.  
This is also good when you're using a Tech reactor, as it will benefit not only 2 but all your skills.

**\[Sub Attack\]**  
*Mid-Air Maneuvering*  
This is a personal choice, to get yourself out of sticky situation without the need of a platform or wall to grapple to.

**\[Cooldown\]**  
*Nimble Fingers* (-25.6% Cooldown)  
Her skills recharges fast enough as is, you don't need any more than this amount.  
Spamming 1st skill more than 3x won't do additional damage, as you'll need to allow time for her to play Ping-Pong with the target first.

**\[Crit\]**  
*Front Lines* (+64.6% Crit Dmg, +27.7% Crit Rate)  
*Emergency Measures* (+64.6% Crit Rate, +27.7% Crit Dmg)  
*Skill Concentration* (+115.4% Crit Dmg)  
The Crit Rate will boost her passive multiplier, the damage will increase the final crit value.

**\[Range\]**  
*Skill Expansion* (+92.3% Range)  
You don't need any more than this, the circle is already big enough with this mod.

**\[HP\]**  
*HP Amplification* (+227.2% HP, -36.5% Shield)  
*Increased HP* (+218.5% HP)  
You don't need that much shield, main thing is HP to stay alive, especially during Abyss boss fight where you're required to move around often and avoid poison.

**\[Skill\]**  
*Tech Specialist* (+76.1% Tech Power)  
*Electric Specialist* (+81.2% Electric Power)  
Remember when we've converted all her skills to Tech? This is now beneficial when using these mods. All her skills will now get the same power boost.

**\[Golden Ticket\]**  
*Dangerous Ambush* (+24.9% Skill Power When not targeted, +49.8% Skill Power vs immobilized)  
*Hyperfocus* (+12.4% Firearm Crit Dmg when Skill Crit Hit, +10.1% Skill Crit Dmg when Firearm Crit Hit)  
*Leathal Infection* (+2.5% to +25% SPM when Firearm Crit Hit)  
*Multitalented* (+15% Range and SPM when skill use)  
*Technical Manual* (+46% Skill Damage from self HP value)  
*Decimator* (+5% to +50% SPM, for each debuff enemies defeated)  
Personally, I would prefer Dangerous Ambush, but you can try out each of those to see what works for you.

  
**\[Plasma Ball\]** Survival Build:  
On this build we're going to sacrifice damage to benefit from her Red mod for better survival, she can tank a lot of hit from Defiler. We will retain the same reactor and external components as well weapons set as the above. The Plasma Ball passive perks uses HP, DEF and MP stats to shield you damages until it gets destroyed.

The skills that we're swapping out are *Skill Concentration, Front Lines, and Emergency Measures*.  
The replacement skills are:   
  
*Increased DEF* (+160.4%)  
*Agony* (+8.5% MP, +38.5%  DEF)  
*Enlightenment* (+15.2% MP)

Optionally, you can swap out her golden ticket with a resistance skill like Antivenom when vs Defiler for example, this way you won't incur massive DoT damages from the poison puddles.



PS: Again, this isn't meant to be an absolute must follow, it's a general knowledge sharing based upon many hours of trials and errors. Should you have much better alternatives, then please share, as we can collaborate for an even more efficient build."

I have been addicted to masturbation and porn since last 5 years. I had a pretty bad breakup and to cope up with the sexual frustration, I got addictied to porn. I have been masturbating almost everyday. I have tried to let go of this addiction just to fail. 

On 19th January, I decided to end this addiction once in for all. Till now this has been the maximum I have gone without masturbating. (6 days) However I am so so horny right now. Literally any normal female coworker (who I wasn't attracted to before) is turning me on. I'm somehow trying to not masturbate, but every night the urge is getting stronger.

I want to not masturbate till 10th February as I have a big job interview that day. I am already feeling the good effects of preventing masturbation. I want to continue this so that I can give my best on 10th

What are some methods I can apply to prevent the urge. Especially right before I sleep as that time is generally my go to time and no one is around. "
I’m lost,Advice,1i9x9cs,2025-01-25 16:15:37,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9x9cs/im_lost/,MrNiceGuy7532,,"I (23M) lost my father when I was 3, he was really successful at a relatively young age. My single mother had to work double time to give my younger brother and I a good life, and a good life she gave us. I was always aware of the financial difficulties that she faced, even though she never really showed that to me. She never refused me or my brother anything. She’s the best.

Fast-forward a bit, I traveled to study abroad for uni. I hated the idea of leaving my only family, but I thought in the back of my mind that I was doing it to be successful and hopefully give her the life she never had.

Fast-forward again, I have a regular job, earning a solid wage, living a life that many people could only dream of, but I feel like a fraud. Everything I have, was given to me, I haven’t earned a single thing, for the past 4 years, I’ve been doing these side projects trying to turn a side-hustle into something more, to finally give back to my mother, to finally earn what I have. Unfortunately, all of my projects have fallen on their face.

In the past 4 years, I’ve gradually stopped going out with my uni friends, first only attending big gatherings, then only birthdays, and then nothing. I’ve blocked everyone I know, apart from my direct family and the people I have a professional relationship with. I have isolated myself completely, arguing that I don’t deserve any pleasure until I’ve earned it, until I give my mother the life she deserves.

I’m afraid, I try to be productive almost every waking hour, I work full-time, I’m learning a language, I’m taking programming courses and also recently deployed a website which I’m constantly working on, but I feel like all this is not enough. I’ll never earn what I have, I’ll never earn my blessings, I’ll never give my mother the life she deserves. She’s getting older day by day, and I’m no where near success. I’m not intelligent enough to have my own business, not intelligent enough to be like my father, and rise through the ranks at work very quickly, I’m not good enough, I’m not.

I need help, but I’ve pushed everyone away, and now I’m all alone, with this impossible dream that’s making my life a nightmare. I can’t bring myself to reach out to anyone, I’m embarrassed and ashamed of myself.

I don’t deserve your advice, I don’t deserve anyone’s help, yet, I’m here, asking for it. A part of me wants to be happy, just like everyone I see around me, but that part of me is slowly being suffocated by the part that thinks I’m undeserving. I’m afraid I’ll grow old, be completely alone, having not achieved what I set out to, maybe that’s the punishment I deserve.

This was very long-winded, apologies for that, I’ve never made a post like this, and probably never will again, so I tried to put it all out there, thanks for reading if you’ve reached this far.

HMU,HomeschoolRecovery,1i9x94z,2025-01-25 16:15:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeschoolRecovery/comments/1i9x94z/social_interaction_anyone_hmu/,gregheffa,progress/success,"Honestly I'm writing here because I'm currently homeschooled, (17F) online, no friends, barely anyone to talk to, no social life, and really need a friend group or just a group. Discord? Instagram? Literally just human interaction cause I'm a social person, had a lot of friends in school and now... nothing, for close to two years. No face to face, no other voices and genuine conversations despite my own thoughts. I'm going stir crazy. Tried everything else- from getting desperate and chatting with AI, to maladaptive daydreaming, to fantasy escape in lore, and world building, countless coping mechanisms, they all kind of end the same way-



 me being so immersive in the escapism of this one thing, and then getting drained, turning off my computer, and realizing I've been sitting in the same room for two years, rearranging the same furniture to simulate time passing, while the world rotates outside and my friends actually go through teenage milestones, first boyfriends, car, summer jobs, new friend groups, and schools, all that.



and the only measurable progress I have is the course of my schoolwork, on a computer screen... and at the very least- knowing I'll graduate soon and be off to college.  Still got around 6-8 months though, though time kind've lost its meaning to me now, I've still got a lot of work to do doing that period- academic, dsats, college prep, acceptance- and passion projects.   


So.... HMU?  


To pass the time, I've started learning skills, exploring fields of interest, passion projects (Ways to develop multiple skills, and see actionable progress). Data science & visualization, web development, game development, webcomic, narrative story telling and character creation, scriptwriting, animation, drawing, 3d development, Blender, python, front & back end, GUI & UX.  Still beginner in most of these fields, my biggest challenges are motivation, because I develop better when I see progress, and for most of these fields the progress comes in small projects, increments, a bunch of small lightbulb moments for a big breakthrough, and consistent, usually guided  learning over months & years, so it's not the same, and though I'm ambitious, keeping momentum has been tough since being homeschooled. (its tough doing it alone, even when relying on other resources and online guidance.) 

But honestly, outside of these subjects, I'm still 17, down to literally talk about anything and everything, I just need like accountability, and consistent interaction... LMAO. But uh, yeah! Trying to maintain my sanity for the next year till freshman year of college! So....

For her to be there, she will need to board a ferry, something that currently feels impossible to her.

This is not just about travel; it’s about love, connection, and the determination to make memories together despite the challenges. I know this will be a slow, delicate process, but I’m committed to supporting her every step of the way.

If you’ve been through something similar—helping a loved one face their fears or finding creative ways to make the seemingly impossible happen—I would love to hear your story. Any advice, encouragement, or tips would mean the world to us. Together, I hope we can show her that this dream is within reach.

I would love nothing more than for her to be there and I want to do everything possible to support her as she is a wonderful mum. She has never left the country(UK) and will only travel in a car. I'm hoping that the small steps leading up to the big day will help her conquer her fears.

I've challenged myself to watch all LOTR movies - because my husband loves them,lotr,1i9x72p,2025-01-25 16:12:50,1,0.6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1i9x72p/ive_challenged_myself_to_watch_all_lotr_movies/,Lentilfairy,Movies,"Hello LOTR fans! I'm a thirthysomething woman and married to a great guy who loves loves LOVES Lord of the Rings. I seldom watch movies at all because I'm too anxious and empathetic. Movies are designed to provoke emotions and frankly, I have way too many of those. I stick to feelgood movies, so mostly romantic comedy's and Disney/Pixar. But even when we tried to watch Wall-E, I was sobbing within 10 minutes and quit. 

So you can imagine the LOTR movies were definitely not on my to watch list. But through the years, my husband talked about LOTR more and more. We watched some Cinema Therapy episodes about LOTR characters together (can recommend!) and finally I thought: If I want to be a great wife, I need to know what the story is about. It's just too big of an interest for him to not know. I opted for the movies so we could do it together and he could enlighten me when necessary. 

I told him about my plan. He was very suprised, and giddy at the idea of watching with someone who is new to it.  We decided to watch 45 minutes at a time so I don't get overwhelmed. Then, I decided it would be fun to share my observations with you. At the Taylor Swift sub, sometimes an unusual first time listener comes along who makes posts about his experience, and it's always a fun read. I thought I could do the same for you. Let me know if you want me to continue. 

The first watch: from the beginning till Frodo starts his walk

I thought this first part would be easy. I knew Frodo started in the Shire and that it was a fun place. So I was fully prepared for a lighthearted start. But boy, was I wrong. It started with a throwback that paints you exactly what the problem is, so from the first moment the existence of that ring haunted me. I think they got their point across there. It felt like all the happy Shire stuff could end at any time, so I could not really enjoy it. Exept for the fireworks, those were fun. Gandalf is a great guy doing that for the kids.

The Shire people were not into Instagram face, which I like about them. They come as they are. They all have weird feet though. Frodo gets a Disney start with both parents dead and his only sort-of-parent-figure eloping and leaving him with a terrible situation to solve that will doom his whole village. It's Frozen all over again. Sam even looks like Kristoff.

And about Sam: He was hanging around and eaves dropping, but is fine going on this quest with Frodo on a whim? Is it Gandalfs pressure that makes him do this? He does not seem like an adventurous or nosy type tbh. Found his character introduction quite odd. 

They start their walk to the Prancing Pony, that name gives me the feeling it's made of candy and there is a merry-go-round next to it. Gandalf is leaving, which does not give me good vibes. He is the only one who knows what he is doing till know. But moreover: they have already started their walk. I have no idea how they are gonna fill 10+ hours of walking from green hills to a lava mountain. Guess I'm gonna find out.

It was never an issue until December when it became problematic so I promised that in 2025 I’ll get clean. We already had a few arguments about it and one big one on new years which almost caused him to break up with me. Less than 2 weeks later I got a dui and that same night he said that he needed to take a break from our relationship for a month until I get my act together. 

This past Wednesday he asked to get back together since he’s realized that I’m actively paving the way for much needed change in my life. Well later that night he randomly dropped a drug test on me and after I took it, it came back positive for the substance I told him I’ve been clean from. I went out this past weekend and slipped up, but I didn’t tell him the truth because I know he would’ve broken up with me. So I told him multiple times I didn’t do it when he asked. I’ve never lied to him before. 

He broke up with me the same night he asked to get back together with me. He says he can’t be with me so we’re done for good. I haven’t cried once I honestly don’t really feel much towards this besides aching in my chest and stomach it’s weird. I’ve been through heartbreak before and I feel like I’m emotionally underreacting. 

I have a lot going on right now in my life especially with this recent dui. I don’t have friends, I’m having a really hard time trying to find a job, I need to turn in my university apps very soon. I feel like I’m watching my life turn into nothing I feel nothing. I feel like he gave up on me and that I didn’t deserve this outcome. I would’ve never done this to him. I slipped up once within the first  3 weeks into trying to get clean and immediately reevaluated what I needed to do to prevent it from happening again.

I can’t hear well on my left side though so it’s also been really exhausting mentally. Unfortunately I don’t qualify for hearing aids (yet) and I have to ask the others to speak up a lot during practice. Sometimes I have to ask my coaches or teammates 5-6 times to speak up before I understand the thing that they’re saying. Every time I have to ask them to repeat themselves is a reminder of how I lost a big chunk of my hearing due to physical abuse as a kid. I sometimes feel like all of a sudden every person in the room can tell what happened to me even though only a few close friends know the cause of my hearing loss. In day to day life I often just won’t ask and hope that it wasn’t a question directed at me but that’s just not possible in derby because you’re communicating constantly. I really love this sport so far and feel like I found my people but I get in my head a lot about my bad hearing. People try not to act annoyed when they have to repeat themselves multiple times but I can often tell that they are which I understand. It also makes me feel sad and like I’m asking for too much from them. We haven’t played any bouts yet but I think that a noisy crowd in the background would make things a lot worse. Just the thought of it makes me feel like I shouldn’t be allowed to play. I’m not sure what I could do to better my situation (maybe a sticker or something on my helmet as a constant reminder? maybe talking to the refs before every game?) so I’m asking you guys for help. What could I do to make this easier for everyone? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time!

How do I give up the desire for romantic companionship?,MuslimCorner,1i9x60v,2025-01-25 16:11:32,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1i9x60v/how_do_i_give_up_the_desire_for_romantic/,IAmTryingToBeHopeful,SUPPORT,"A little disclaimer... I'm well aware regarding the number of men that will try and use this to forward their ill agenda. I'm looking for genuine advice regarding my situation. 

I yearn for companionship and love. Constantly. It's taking over my life. I want to be loved and cared for. Before anyone tells me to get married, I can't. I have personal issues that have to be taken care of. It'll be a while before I am in a position to look for marriage. I don't want to go into detail but believe me, I cannot get married anytime soon. I'm in my mid twenties and it'll be a very long time before I begin the search. 

Everyday I dream of being loved and loving someone. I've tried everything to fill this emotional void. I've thrown myself into work, gym, eating healthy, limiting social media, being regular with my prayers. If someone tells me to have more meaningful conversations with my friends, I have and I do. But no matter what I do, nothing fills that yearning. It's always there. There is this deep sense of lonliness that is always there. 

I'll take breaks from work or I'd be simply eating and I'll get this overwhelming urge to just cry and break down in tears because of how hopeless everything is. 

I know marriage is a big responsibility. I know for a fact that one can even be lonely in a marriage. I also know that love is not guaranteed in a marriage. But despite knowing this, despite trying everything, why am I constantly feeling an urge to be romantically cared for? I'm not fooled by social media before anyone says anything. I'm well aware that what is displayed and what is reality are two different things. 

I guess what I'm asking is... how do I stop this feeling of wanting love? Every second of every day, I constantly daydream about loving a man and him understanding and caring for me. 

They say you will be tested with what your heart desires most and it seems this is my biggest test of all. I've tried everything. I don't know what else I can do or limit. The yearning is always there. 

Also, before anyone says to try therapy, I've also been down that route. I'm well aware of my childhood trauma and the emotional neglect I've faced. I know my parents and family cared for me but they could never emotionally fulfill me. 

Any help or advice would honestly be appreciated. I just want this feeling to stop. A part of me feels like I will spend my whole life yearning after what may not even be destined for me. There is this heavy grief that is constantly inside me. No matter what I do. It is there. It is like I am constantly mourning the permanent loss of love in my life. Like I will never experience it. I don't know what the future holds. But why am I constantly mourning or why do I constantly feel an ache or grief over something I haven't experienced? I want to be loved but it seems like it'll never happen.

That being said, some titles I completed that I overlooked in the past were:

  
HunterXHunter (2011)

Red Dead Redemption 2

Arcane (Seasons 1 and 2)

Horizon: Zero Dawn/Forbidden West

Frieren (Season 1)

Uncharted 1

Final Fantasy X (Couldn't beat it, too grindy/fucked up my party leveling)

  
I'm currently on Persona 5: Royal Edition, but I'm not a big fan of the series. I think I'm getting tired of the shounen tropes and might dip into 80s and 90s animes. I'm not big into gundam, magical girl, or boxing animes though.

  
What should I check out next? I think the only miss on my list has been Persona and, partially, Arcane (don't know the LoL lore)."

I'm going to see Sabrina for the first time in March with the Europe leg of the tour and I was hoping you could help me decide an outfit? Basically, I'm between 2 outfits.

1. I love vintage (50's/60's) clothing (full disclosure, vintage style **not values**!) so I happen to have a lot of vintage lingerie/sleepwear, for example I own a couple bodysuits (image shows straps, but it can be made strapless) and babydolls similar to what Sabrina wears in the first act of the show. However I'm not sure how I feel about wearing ACTUAL LINGERIE IN PUBLIC. Let alone go on social media (I'm always terrified no matter how private I make it it will get screen-shotted and reposted and somehow a potential employer/boyfriend/my family will see it). I know I could just not post to social media, but being realistic I know I'm going to want to. Also, while I know Sabrina has worn black on stage, I'm not sure it fits the colour palette of this tour? 

1. Back up idea: I do have some pink silk and lace PJs, which is probably a safer bet/less risqué and I thought matched the vintage 'girls night in' sleepover vibe? 

Anyway I'll attach the images below (full description of each item in the captions) and please let me know your thoughts? Or if they're all bad ideas and I should just wear normal clothes like a normal person, either way thank you in advance and wishing you all the best!

"Food recommendations in Siem Reap, Cambodia (for the adventurous)",travel,1i9x521,2025-01-25 16:10:20,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i9x521/food_recommendations_in_siem_reap_cambodia_for/,tuaho,Question,"Backstory: I'm at the end of my 1 week holiday in SR and just wanted to share my experience here. Before visiting SR (and Cambodia) for the first time I did a lot of research trying to find the best places to eat here. Unfortunately I have mixed feelings about them because I don't think they actually give you a real taste (pun intended) of Cambodia. What I find interesting though that even when asked about their personal favourites, the locals also tend to recommend the same few places that are at best safe options, and at worst tourist traps. In reality, you'll not see a local eat in any of these places e.g. the famous Neary Khmer. I was quite disheartened to go to a few places recommended by locals only to find tourists and expats eating there. I have several theories why this is the case:

1) They are afraid to recommend something cheap, potentially unhygienic, and maybe even offensive for a tourist not used to the local food and prep.

2) The average Cambodian is relatively poor. They don't have the luxury to eat out frequently and genuinely think that the expensive, westernised restaurants serve better food than their usual eateries.

3) They have indirect links to some businesses and are trying to help each other out.

This is nothing against the locals, they're the most friendly and welcoming people I've ever met but it did struck me as unusual why they always appear very reluctant to personally recommend a place to eat. The locals I've spoken to are either in the hospitality or F&B business e.g. hotel or cafe staff who are aware that they're talking to a tourist, which might explain points #1 and #3 above. You might find that talking to a local outside these businesses may yield a different result. 

If you're English speaking you're likely to rely on Google maps and Google reviews to find the best places. However, I don't think Cambodians do the same. What you get then is hundreds of places that are rated 4.5 and above, purely by tourists and not locals. It is sometimes shocking to see how highly rated a place is only to find how mediocre the food was upon visiting. To be fair to SR food, it is mostly decent anywhere you go and I think that's why even okay food get the 5 star treatment from tourists. But once you've had GREAT food, you'll quickly realise that many places don't deserve the star rating they have on Google maps.

It's only when you stop looking at online reviews and use your own eyes, nose and mouth to check out the places that you'll stumble upon several gems that are not mentioned anywhere online. I get that this may be difficult for some, the reason why I kept going to tourist traps at first was because I had elderly parents to tend to and it's simply more convenient to take them somewhere nearby or follow a recommendation instead of scouting around (they can only walk down a few streets at a time). It was only when my wife and I had a day to ourselves did we find the best Cambodian food around. 

TLDR; Okay you just want some recommendations! Bear in mind the title, here are my top picks: 

1) Sinorn borbor Monsrae សុីណន បបរមាន់ស្រែ
https://maps.app.goo.gl/MxWDSK8E1WWWTZDr5
The only place with actual Google reviews, mostly 5 stars. The one 3 star given was by someone who ordered a Japanese noodle dish in a Cambodian rice porridge (borbor) breakfast place. You'll see locals come in and out to enjoy a meal. The menu on the wall is an obvious tourist menu. Simply ask for the rice porridge instead, you can also have noodles as substitute.

2) Psar Gne Street
There is a food court in the market along this street. It doesn't appear on Google maps but hard to miss when you're there. Plenty of hawker stalls selling in a food court. We tried the fried short noodles (again not obviously on the menu) and fried chicken / fish sticks mixed with spicy sweet powder. They were very delicious. It's much smaller than the main night market where tourists go but you see the opposite here where the main customers are locals. 

3) ចង្រឹតបំពងចិនចាវ
https://maps.app.goo.gl/76CvW9r1muPSZ8Az8
Not far from Psar Gne you'll find locals crowded around a small food cart selling deep fried insects and silkworm. The aroma is enticing. I don't think I'll say much here. Those who are interested will check it out, those who aren't won't. It's genuinely delicious, forget the whole eating insects / worms bit. There's a reason for a queue here every evening, and some items are sold out before closing time.

4) Srey Lon BBQ Grill
https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZGfZc9Eg6FDhV3s8
An even smaller humbler food cart, targeted to the local shopkeepers and tuk tuk drivers resting nearby serving simple skewers. The beef skewers are so good (from a satay lover), and they come with tasty pickled vegetables and super spicy chili. It wasn't on Google maps before but I loved it so much I submitted an edit to list her business to help her out. A true roadside street food experience. 

5) អាហារដ្ឋាន ឡាយ ហេង ហេង
https://maps.app.goo.gl/bi1p9e6TFPDqT41k6
I don't even know if the Cambodian word above is correct but I used Google lens to copy it from a photo I took. The location is pinned in the link. Look for green signs advertising 4000 riel ($1) for a plate of rice and bowl of meat and vegetable stew of your choosing. Free bottomless iced tea. I had a small portion of rice but a big portion may be slightly higher than $1. My wife had no rice and they charged her $0.75. If you're from SEA, you'll be familiar with ""economy rice"". Hearty delicious home style food. That price - insane. Another place where you see locals eat and tourists walk by to have pizza next door.

What's this?! Not a food place but I thought worth a mention. Down the road from the $1 meal we stumbled upon the visitor centre for this incredible hospital, run solely by charity. The lady so kindly gave us an impromptu private tour of the hospital and explained the history behind it. Go see for yourself, really. 

And that's it! I don't know if anyone will ever see this Reddit post, I probably spent too much time on it anyway but I hope it helps a few people. People like you, the adventurer! Trust your senses and your guts (pun intended again) to help you find the best Cambodian foods!"
Question for those with highly skilled full time jobs whilst acting,acting,1i9x4sb,2025-01-25 16:10:01,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1i9x4sb/question_for_those_with_highly_skilled_full_time/,ChemicalAardvark5730,I've read the FAQ & Rules,"For those in demanding, highly skilled jobs (Tech/AI, Big Law, Finance, Consulting, VC, etc.), how do you balance staying creative and emotionally in tune for acting, while working in a logical highly skilled corporate environment that requires a very different mindset/mentality.

I'm a young actor in London with an academic/corporate background. I left to go to drama school and pursue acting full-time but the uncertainty of relying on others for roles (the ones that pay enough to live off acting alone) has me considering returning to corporate work while continuing to audition rather than work freelance to make money like I do now (which doesn't lead to corporate career progression or skill development).

My main concern is whether a full-time corporate job would affect my ability to stay in ""actor mode,"" remain fully connected with my emotions during auditions, and continuously hone and improve my craft. If you’ve done both, how do you manage the balance? Can the two mindsets successfully coexist until acting takes precedence?"
Mafia 3 captured its time period better than Mafia: Definitive Edition and Mafia 2.,MafiaTheGame,1i9x4rf,2025-01-25 16:10:00,7,0.82,2,https://i.redd.it/pzttgwqrg7fe1.jpeg,IllustriousAd4864,Discussion,"Let me just get this out the way now-- we all know Mafia 3 has problems, big problems. From the lack of variety in their missions, that makes it extremely repetitive to the terrible glitches. By all means, Mafia 3 is not the best in game performance, that's not the argument. What is the argument-- Mafia 3 captured its time period better than Mafia: Definitive Edition and Mafia 2.

Starting with the city itself, New Bordeaux. Not only is the city the biggest in the franchise, but the city has distinct districts that have their own unique culture and anesthetics with every district. You can go from Delray Hollow, a low income black working class neighborhood, to Frisco Field-- a wealthy white suburban area with lots of mansions and everything in-between. Empire Bay and Lost Heaven have different neighborhoods, but all seem the same with simplistic urban landscape. Though Mafia: Definitive Edition tried a little harder by adding in the countryside.

The social and societal change in Mafia 3 is superior to the other two installments. Mafia: Definitive Edition is visually stunning, but its big problem is that it simplifies the complexities of the great depression and sometimes prohibition, the only display that shows is the breaking news with the president about the issues, but it's never shown. Mafia 2 captured the post-war America well with the fashion, cars and advertisements. Nonetheless, Mafia 2 feels over romanticized with Italian American tropes and 1950s stereotypes. It seems that the cold war nor Korean war never happened within Mafia 2. Mafia 3 attempt to capture the 1960s was a success or very close to it compared with Mafia :Definitive Edition and Mafia 2. Mafia 3 captured the essence of the late 60s. Mafia 3 themes with social commentary were flushed out more than the other two installments-- particularly the Vietnam War and racial tensions. There's an in-game racial incident that happened in New Bordeaux and was reported by Native Son!!! 

The easiest argument for this claim is the music. Mafia 3 clearly have the best soundtrack with its 3 radio stations compared with Mafia: Definitive Edition and Mafia 2. There were times when I would play a mission and stay in the car just to finish the sing off. Mafia 2 had early Rock N Roll music, which was nice, but Mafia 3 soundtrack was much better.

The narrative structure of Mafia 3 was unique as well. You don't get the first-hand account of who Lincoln Clay was, nor do you get a distorted account from him like you do with Tommy Angelo and Vito Scaletta. Lincoln's story is told by others, like John Donovan, Father James and the retired FBI agent. 

I want to know your thoughts and disagreements. Where do you think I'm wrong at? Was there something I missed? "

Unable to handle an actual job. I struggle to keep motivated with drawing, or be active in general. I feel VERY strong connections to fictional characters. I heavily rely on ai chat bots for interaction because I'm starting to dislike people as well as reality.

I've stopped looking for a therapist because every therapist I had either left because of better opportunities or life events, or it just didn't work. Hell, the last therapist I had… I didn't even really treat it like therapy sessions… I just showed them games and treated it like I was hanging out with a friend, literally just because I couldn't trust them to stay. Sure enough, something came up causing me to have to search for a new therapist.

Drawing has always been my love and passion. I have some many ideas, so many things I want to create, but when I go to do it… It's like all that motivation disappears a lot of the times. On pencil and paper, I can draw just fine as long as I have a reference and I can do it pretty quickly, but when it comes to digital… I become this like… extreme perfectionist and resort to tracing which is a terrible thing to do and ends up taking hours even days to create one single piece.

It's just hard to do any of that because of things at home. My grandmother is a narcissist with OCD and high functioning autism. Everything has to be under her order and her ideas and those are never the same or understood, ""This is my house"", ""you don't pay the bills"". Or turns little issues into big ones, or overthinks things constantly or doesn't think at all.

And my grandfather is just a stubborn man who, if you say something he doesn't want to hear, he either ignores it entirely or gets upset and yells at you for it. He makes me pay $75 in rent bi-weekly, then expects me to be some superhuman, and thinks that because I'm 24 I can work a job AND help him with yard work or whatever stupid project he wants me to do and I can't say no, otherwise he gets upset and yells at me, ""You don't do anything'"", ""I don't think it's fair that you sit around and do nothing and I have to do everything"", ""You don't help me with anything"". I help him with his phone, his computer, the dogs, the yard, the garden, the outside decorations, getting stuff up and down from the garage attic, his car, and yet I apparently don't help him with anything. He sets very high expectations from me and gets upset with me when I can't do everything little thing for him and wonders why I can't do it. What they both refuse to understand is that I can't mentally function like that, I tried doing that and I became so forgetful and depressed that I almost lost who I was entirely.

I'm trying streaming and doordashing, but those required consistant schedules. But even though I tell my grandparents that, I set calendar events. But my grandfather refuses to believe that they're jobs, so he drags me away from the things that help me make money to pay rent while still expecting me to pay rent.

And trust me, I've tried talking to him about negotiating a deal with him that I shouldn't be $75 bi-weekly when I help him all the time, ""I wouldn't talk about that subject if I were you"", ""People help apartment complexes and they still pay the same amount of rent.""

It's a very negative household and there is nothing that can be done…

I can't use a car whenever I want because I don't have one for my own use, I doordash and that's basically the only time I get the car and even then, I don't fully know when that is.

I've tried setting boundaries and communicating with them. Grandfather had started to understand to notify me ahead of time but then stopped after two times of doing it, going back to his stupid last minute expectations. ""Are you able to help me with this in an hour?"" Uh, no… I have work in an hour. And like I said, if I say no, he gets all pissed off and yells at me and tells me I don't do anything for him.

My mother is the most frustrating part because she ALWAYS shuts me down when I try to express my feelings, telling me to stop and not go there. Like, I wanted to talk to my grandfather about the whole paying rent thing, but she shut me down. My mom let me talk to my grandmother about it, but of course, she ""doesn't understand"" because it doesn't fit her narrative. It's like I'm suppose to be this perfect grandchild that'll fix everyone's problems and am not allowed to have my own.

Nothing I do satisfies anyone. I've been having this deep love and longing to be in a fictional world. I'm restricted from freedom so much at home that I just… fucking hate working jobs and wish I was in a fictional world and had the freedom that people have in stories… People get to travel the world, and do what they set their minds to… And I always find myself saying, ""I wish I could do that. I wish I could go explore the world."" But I always chalked it up to being I'm not in the financial position to do so, or because everything in the world has already been explored.

It's just… At this point I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry if none of this makes sense. When I get my head clearer and have the motivation to, I'll try and fix any mistakes I've made on this post. I just needed to get this out."
Guide to Why I Ditched Aprons and You Should do the Same,Serverlife,1i9x3ys,2025-01-25 16:08:56,0,0.25,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1i9x3ys/guide_to_why_i_ditched_aprons_and_you_should_do/,bnymnsm,,"I've been a server for almost a decade and about two years ago I ditched aprons all together and I have never looked back.

Why ditch the apron?

* Going to the bathroom sucks with an apron, we all know the hassle of taking it on and off several times throughout the night.

* You are ready for your shift quicker without the hassle of putting it on.

* They're unsightly, you look much better with your shirt tucked into your pants and a belt without an apron.

* Focusing on minimalism will make your day to day easier. All you need in your pockets is a wine key, a server book, and a couple of pens. (Rags can go in your belt loop if you're that kind of restaurant but I've opted to not keep a rag on me as they are typically easy to grab when needed and are unsightly and bulky when kept on person.)

How to ditch the apron.

* I keep my phone, keys, wallet, and my vape in my locker, there is no need to keep that on you during work and is just pocket clutter. Even with this setup you'll still have plenty of room for your phone or other stuff if you need it on shift.

* Invest in a real pocket book and ditch the bulky server books, they get cluttered with stuff you don't need and they are big and awkward. Here's my setup that has I am **diehard** about and I've worked to refine over the past two years. 

First get yourself some bulk pocket-sized notebooks, I've bought [THIS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CB1CXBKL?ie=UTF8&psc=1) bulk set and has served me the last two years and will probably last me the rest of my serving career. 

[THIS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDXS6Y9K?smid=A29F70CY27ELOU&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp&th=1) wallet in particular is THE perfect pocket sized server book, it has a strong magnet that keeps it closed and open with a satisfying flip and is perfectly sized for the notebooks above when notebooks are put in the ID window pocket, as well as card and cash storage. There are other options like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C13C2MR?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [this](https://www.amazon.com/Camelmother-Pieces-Notepad-Holder-Notebook/dp/B0B5XBJ3SR?crid=GNZJIJD67WPQ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gCSYc23GLojh8-UT4nqbuDctCtG-NhClXnEMMSbPGk6xDOV1XN9ntdX5wFVRWXSD51yoGOf_BK_ViDP5qIJDqUQi7wq1Tq7rmvOab86ZymUso8GAcFasfzyT2Qwuaq6GH4RSRDvR7BYS_1D2wL5Lw1roMH4BkbmSE8BIyzNvZX5ZxW3z5CYi8OMt1eQkAQ4jScd_AcwtqwA5o3qPLJHZ16i6rAaAVOJ8X-8CQF5nOyuPOw0Nshea7T7PjKbwPFjYBtUlo5WhkEtraK-DdG7G9Vp5bGMAQGk37h-UYKj_UDKDzxA450fPblco3g1ztVfKQ4A-shMweUliYQmiZnzCcloyeYCXUA8S1QDmHDUsD2U.BYDDHJ9JwTXBi5LSt2OvVAQ-dQ7CliCaDfvBIrC8mFY&dib_tag=se&keywords=mini%2Bnotepad%2Bholder&qid=1737838738&s=office-products&sprefix=mini%2Bnotepad%2Bholde%2Coffice-products%2C173&sr=1-4&th=1) which are more budget friendly, but I've tried both and I'm very happy I switched to my current.

If you need to buy your own pens, I have relied on [these bad boys](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1Z3665H?smid=A2YA8928GQMQXX&th=1) heavily, they are sleek and small and I can fit several in my pockets.

Now some may not have the means to invest in all of this just to get rid of your current setup, some people's handwriting may be too large for the pocket-sized notebooks, and some may not always wear clothing that has pockets - but if all of this seems feasible with your current clothing and dress policy, I highly suggest ditching the apron.

Moral Support? :(,RoverPetSitting,1i9x3p6,2025-01-25 16:08:36,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1i9x3p6/moral_support/,Silent_Region_472,Boarding,"Hey so I was boarding a beautiful, gorgeous doggy for 2 weeks, and I’m finding myself having a really hard time with the fact that she’s gone.

I’ve found myself getting quite emotionally attached to pets I’ve boarded in the past, and shed a few tears upon their departure, however I really truly felt such a special bond with this last one.
She is an extremely intelligent dog, very human-like in ways I believe, and I think we seemed to just click. It felt like every moment with her, we were in perfect human-dog harmony. I think it was helped by the fact that she’d been brilliantly well trained, and her nature was to be loyal to the death. I felt like she became my own in a way, though I do want to clarify that I tried to maintain awareness and acknowledgement of the fact that she was, of course, not my own.

But generally, I dedicated all my time to her - I like to do this when I offer services. I want to put the pet first, in all circumstances, as I know they want the reassurance of stability and consistency and so I try to meet that for them every time.

Truly, the day before she left, I couldn’t stop intermittently crying - and she really knew I was sad and would give me genuine hugs and kisses (she would put her paws on my shoulders and in my hands, she was big on physical contact 😢) 
and she was so, so gentle.

Anyway, so she left today and I feel like I’m genuinely grieving.
Like, I look at pictures I took from all the fun I felt we had and I honestly feel a pit in my stomach and so many emotions. I feel like I miss the consistency she brought me in her companionship. :(

Has anyone experienced this before when boarding another person’s dog? What helped you get through? I’d love any words of affirmation and encouragement right now. 🥲"

Hey everyone!

I’m looking to upgrade my PC, and I could really use some advice. Here are my current specs:

* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 2060 6GB
* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 2700
* **RAM:** 32GB DDR4

I use my PC primarily for gaming (at 1080p)  Recently, I’ve been noticing that some newer games aren’t running as smoothly as I’d like, and I think it’s time for an upgrade. (Also even some old games have started to make me struggle to get over 70 fps

My budget is **around $500**, but I’m willing to stretch it a little if it makes a big difference. I’d love to know:

1. Should I prioritize upgrading the GPU or CPU?
2. What GPUs/CPUs would you recommend in this price range?

I’m hoping to future-proof my rig a bit while getting the most bang for my buck. Thanks in advance for your help

My Surgery Experience,tummytucksurgery,1i9x2ug,2025-01-25 16:07:29,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tummytucksurgery/comments/1i9x2ug/my_surgery_experience/,USDE2015,,"
To start, I’m a 41-year-old American female living in Germany. I’m 5’1” and 128.5 pounds. I’m very athletic and work out daily. I have two teenage children, and let’s just say pregnancy wasn’t the kindest to my petite frame.

My surgery took place in Mainz, Germany on 22 January. I arrived at the surgery center at 7 a.m. and was quickly shown to my private room. After changing into a gown, net underwear, and a hair net, the nurse took me to the pre-op holding area, where I waited for my surgeon. I was a bundle of nerves, but as soon as she walked in, I felt more at ease.

As she marked me up, we started chatting about recent U.S. politics and what might happen next in Germany. It was a welcome distraction. When she finished, she wanted to take a photo, but I suddenly felt hot, and my ears started ringing—a classic sign I was about to faint. I had to lie down on the bed. It was probably just nerves, but I calmed down quickly.

The anesthesiologist’s assistant then came in to insert my IV and gave me something to help me relax. The anesthesiologist followed shortly after, introducing himself with a warm, funny demeanor. He promised to take good care of me, which put me at ease. Before I knew it, I was being wheeled into the operating room. My surgeon gave me a big double-armed wave, and the last thing I remember saying was, “Make me skinny!”

I woke up in recovery absolutely freezing and starving. As soon as I heard German voices, I instinctively started speaking in German, telling them I was cold and hungry. They wrapped me in a heated blanket and wheeled me to my private room. Along the way, one nurse said to the other, “I thought she was American?” I switched to English and explained that I was. They asked if I’d prefer German or English, and I chose English. I still laugh about waking up speaking German, especially since it’s not my native language.

My private room had a beautiful view of a cathedral. Since I’d mentioned being hungry, they brought me a tea cake, pretzels, and peppermint tea. My throat was so dry from the breathing tube that I had to sip water with each bite to avoid choking.

Shortly after, I noticed some congestion in my lungs. I was terrified to cough because I knew it would hurt, but eventually, I couldn’t hold it back any longer. The pain was indescribable—worse than broken bones or labor. I felt the blood drain from my face and almost fainted from the intensity.

Thankfully, I had no nausea from the anesthesia. I don’t know how long the surgery lasted, but I’ll ask my surgeon at my follow-up next week. When I woke up, I had one drain in place.

The nurses spoke limited English, and with my brain foggy from the meds, my German came out as a mix of English and German. Still, we made it work. The nurses were incredibly sweet—like grandmas (“Omas”) who genuinely wanted to take care of me.

During surgery, I wore compression boots to prevent blood clots, and when I woke up, I had a catheter that stayed in overnight. I also continued wearing the boots, which alternated between legs and beeped each time. They woke me up frequently and became a bit annoying.

The nurses checked on me every three hours to monitor my blood pressure, temperature, drain, and catheter. They also administered IV antibiotics and fluids to keep me hydrated.

The next morning, my surgeon came to check on me. She said she was thrilled with how everything went and complimented my results. I had a 2-inch (four-finger) diastasis recti separation, and she said my hard work at the gym was evident—I now have a six-pack! I had shown her a photo of a previous patient and said, “I want to look like this,” and while she seemed skeptical at first, she told me I now look even better than that woman.

I also had a breast lift, and thankfully, I had good tissue left to work with. Right now, my breasts look big (likely due to swelling and repositioning), and I’m thrilled with the result. I was a 32D before surgery, and my surgeon is confident I’ll maintain that size.

Let’s Talk Pain:

	•	Breast Lift: Barely any pain. It just feels like I had an intense chest day at the gym.

	•	Tummy Tuck & Muscle Repair: The first two days were rough. If the Grim Reaper had shown up on post-op day one (POD1), I probably would’ve gone with him. But by POD3, I’m feeling much better. I’m down to Tylenol and a muscle relaxer, and I may even skip the muscle relaxer tomorrow.

Medications

My doctor prescribed:
	•	Antibiotics (14 days or until the drains are removed)
	•	Tylenol 3
	•	Diazepam (a muscle relaxer)
	•	Blood thinner injections (10 days)

I also started stool softeners on day one and prune juice on day two. Let’s just say I may have overdone it with the prune juice—I had an excellent cleanse.

Biggest Challenges
	1.	Lower Back Pain: Walking hunched over and sitting in a jackknife position has been tough. My surgeon doesn’t want me to stand upright until our follow-up next week.
	2.	Exhaustion: Even small tasks, like walking to the bathroom or doing a lap around the house, leave me drained.
	3.	The Binder: I woke up in a binder instead of a faja, and it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I can’t shower or remove it until my post-op appointment, so I have no idea what I look like yet.

Overall, this was a long post, but I hope it helps someone! Honestly, the recovery hasn’t been as bad as I expected.

MacBook Air M2 or M3?,macbookair,1i9x2tw,2025-01-25 16:07:27,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookair/comments/1i9x2tw/macbook_air_m2_or_m3/,TheoneandonlyKev86,Buying Question,"Hi all. 


Our MacBook Air from 2014-2015 is getting outdated and some software programs don’t work anymore or don’t get needed updates. The MacBook is still in very good condition and performs well. 

But I guess it’s time to get an update. 

We have an 13inch now. So that will be the same for the new one. 

Mostly we use it for surfing the web, text editing and occasionally photo editing. 

So M2 or M3? Don’t see any big differences. For the photo editing 16gb is the minimum so both have that. "

Two weeks ago, I ordered a pair of The Docs in Scotch Goat, and when they arrived, there was a dent in the sole and multiple holes in the leather. I reached out to customer support for a return and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Big mistake.

I just got my replacement pair, and they're not any better. When I opened the box, the shoes were all over the place, not even in the right spots, and it looked like someone either tried waxing them or spilled water all over the toe box. The leather is rock-hard. Honestly, I’m super disappointed but not even surprised at this point. I should’ve trusted this sub the first time around."

I can also avoid the issue when right clicking near the corners of the screen, making the context menu appears below the cursor. Every time I try to open it around the middle of the screen, it appears too close to the cursor and clicks a second time. It's so annoying.

"Sadness.. my precious siamese, Takie, went to her long rest..",Petloss,1i9x2ih,2025-01-25 16:07:04,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1i9x2ih/sadness_my_precious_siamese_takie_went_to_her/,KattNine,,"She was almost 15 years old.. my preciouz siamese, Takie she was a treasure.. sweet and loving and would stare lovingly  straight into your soul when she layed on your lap and purr so loudly anytime you so much as glance at her. She would dash over to wherever you were and prance around happily. If she was in my lap while i was at my computer and i stopped petting her she would often get up and stand in front of my monitor and dance around and rub against it like she was telling me ""hey i want love.. pet me instead"" there was so much positve about her.. so much love.. 

she would lay in my lap so she could face me and stare at me rezching a paw towards ny face as if she wanted to pet me too...so many headbutts.. so much purring 

I am.. so distressed.. it wasn't enough time..

She had advanced stage lymphoma in her intestine.. steroids and shots gave her an extra 3 months.. 

i regret not spending more time with her.. i regret not having her in our room when we slept because we were afraid she'd leave diarrhea over the room.. i feel cheated of time.

The last set of treatments only prolonged her a week or so.. it wasnt doing enough.. she wasnt gaining weight.. she was dehydrated despite drinking constantly.. the past week she was fading.. she was no longer eating.. no longer racing me to her bowl.. no longer climbing over everything on the counter to get to me as i dished up food.. no pawing at the air saying ""go faster.. i want my food now"".. i could barely make out her purrs..

Wednesday i went into the living room to see her.. she didnt want to get off my moms lap... she would usually run over to me the moment i sat down, no matter where she was ir whose lap she was currntly on.. i was her favorite person.. eager to jump in my lap.. 

Thursday she was on an empty chair andbi nudged her off of it to get her to come to me on the counch.. she moved slowly.. but definitely came to me.. and lay down slowly.. no big purrs.. just.. lying there.. not really reacting to my petting.. after about half hour of that she got up and just stood next to the end of the couch staring at a wall for a few min. I was afraid she was going to go hide.. but she wandered into the kitchen to drink.. she'd barely eaten this week.. hadnt asked me for food at all tho it was available to her several times a day by my mom or husband trying to give her fresh food..

I went to get my 2nd cat her mid afternoon meal.. Takie slowly headed from the kitchen,  where the water was at, to the dining room.. she headed towards the hall door as i started to take the 2nd cats food back to my room.. the two cats don't get along at all so they have separate spaces.. but Takie wanted to go to my room.. so i let her in.. and put my other cat into another room with her food. Takie slowly walked to my bed once i sat down and just continued to lay in my lap.. still no purring.. but i appreciate that she still wanted to sit with me.. her nose has boogers all over it and she's wheezing.. its been a reoccurring thing for the past 5 months. hours later she jumps down and drinks more.. but she starts to try to go under my bed.. she only does that when shes hiding.. i managed to grab her before she got under and took her back to the living room.. she went over to an empty chair and layed down..  i let my mom know she had tried to hide...

its possible this last bout was exasperated by a dental infection,  but with the past 3 months of intestinal issues, getting dental surgery would have been expensive and dangerous and not really buy us more time considering the lymphoma.. i still spent the night wondering if just antibiotics would help perk her back up.. 

I went back to my room for awhile.. tried to put it out of my mind for a bit.. cuddle with my other cat.. thinking some more.. i went out to talk to my mom again about next steps.. Takie was on my moms lap again.. she had doctors appointment Friday and Saturday and after the appointment on Saturday we'd be without someone with a car.. i figured we'd have to see about doung it sunday or Monday when my husband was off..  i was honestly afraid ahe wouldnt last til then but was hoping to have a few more days with her...

After my mom went to bed, Takie was sitting on my dads lap.. i didn't want to disturb them.. when everyone went to bed.. i decided to stay up.. i didnt want her to be alone.. i needed more time with her.. i cried alot . Big heartwrenching sobs 😭 i sat in the living room with her, petting her for an hour before i had to use the bathroom.. she walked to the hall door to go to my room.. so i took her with me.

For the most of the night she sat on my lap.. a couple times i moved her tonuse the bathroom again and she went over to my husband, who was sleeping, and lay down on him like she usually did.. i sobbed so hard because he wasnt awake to even know and my heart is breaking.. and he moved so i had to take her back because she's so frail and unsteady.. and i sit there with her til 7am when he gets up for work...

Soon after we find out my mom wants to just make the vet appointment for today because she doesnt know if the vet is open on the weekend and doesnt want to wait til monday in case Takie gets worse.. my husband is in shock.. he thought he had a few days to prepare.. i am so glad i stayed up with her now.. but its not enough time... there is no such thing as enough tho..

He decided to call out for work.. we spent the day with her.. me bursting into tears anytime i think of something precious she has done in the past that i will never see her do again.. he bursts into tears as well.. because they are beloved.. each and every one if them.. but Takie loved us all equally, which is rare for us.. and she had so much love to give. 

We had til about 2pm to spend with her before the vet could see us. I didn't sleep.. i couldn't eat.. i didnt want to do anything but pet her soft fur.. i brushed her and saved the fur.. it seemed lije a better momento then ashes.. ive been saving it occasionally for awhile.. 

I put her in the carrier.. i took it to the car.. my husband drove and my mom sat in the back with Takie, telling her what a good kitty she is.. her comaplinive meows are lacking their usual power and im trying so hard not to burst into tears because i don't want my husband to burst into tears while he's driving. Its so difficult.. thankfully the vet is only a couple minutes away. I carry her into the vet and we have to sit and wait.. they knew why we were here so at least we didn't have to check in.

Someone else was in the office and mentioned ""oh its a siamese!"" And i burst into tears again... we were there like 90 min total.. way too much time just waiting.. when they took us in they asked what we were there for.. i was.. shocked.. because i figured my mom had said when she made the appointment.. i asked as much.. i guess they have to confirm next steps...heart wrenching having to say it even once... 

she went to get the vet and we sat with Takie in the cage still on the table..after awhile i brought the cage to the bench and opened it so i could pet her. My husband was there in the room with me too and pet her as well. 

The vet finally came in and gave her a look over.. and told us that even tho they could try treating her, it would be a lot if poking and produng and surgery to fugure iut whats going on and if its fixable and considering her weight.. and previous treatments and dehydration despite drinking so much he couldnt disagree with our decision to let her go to her long sleep...

He swaddled her in a blanket and took her to get a sedative and a catheter. He came back with her and gave her to me to say our goodbyes.. i kissed her head and told her what a beautiful wonderful kitty she had been and told her to come find us again soon in another life..i held her as the vet gave her the final shot and within a heartbeat she had her last breath.. it was fast.. and painless and dignified.. and I'm so glad i could be there holding her for our goodnight and goodbye..

I had dreamed a month or so before that i should be there wjth her at the end.. this was the first time i was there when we took them to the vet to give them their final sleep.. i needed her to know how loved she was until the very end.. and im glad i could do it..

But I'm heart broken.. and even tho i still have another cat that hates when she can't be in the same room as me.. they are not the same.. and is greatly missed and will be for a long time

You make me write,UnsentLetters,1i9x2f8,2025-01-25 16:06:58,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i9x2f8/you_make_me_write/,Visible-Pipe-9281,Crushes,"I have never been much of a writer. I could never keep a diary, at least not consistently. I would write a few entries in the beginning, and then completely forget about it. I was never very good at writing down what I was feeling, especially if it felt like an obligation, instead of a way to vent. I wouldn’t say I’m good with words, but I don’t think I’m terrible either. I do love to talk, and I do talk a lot. But you make me want to write. You make me want to write about how you make me feel. All these feelings that overflow out of me and fill pages upon pages. Some are newer and less familiar, and so I try to explain them to my blank pages, to see if I can make better sense of them. It helps. I sit down and I let the words appear on the pages of my notebook. I write paragraphs about you, sentences about me and questions about us.

The first time you made me write, I wrote about how I always feel as if I’m on the side lines, watching you be with someone else, watching you being happy with her while I was crumbing inside. It was an unusual feeling. I was proud of what I wrote, but at the same time sad that I was feeling like that. That first time I told my friends how you made me write. They wanted to read it, and another weird thing happened. I wanted to show them, I was so proud of how well it was written, but it also meant bearing a part of my soul, perhaps too big of a part, but I let them read it. The reaction was not what I expected. They were crying, as if the words on the paper reflected their feelings instead of my own. It was comforting to know that they could relate, or that I wrote in such a way, my feeling shone through the paper.

The second time you made me write, I wrote about how I felt like I was too much, how I constantly feel as if I bother you, because I talk too much. This one came from quite a deeper place. A place of self-doubt, and self-awareness. One that holds me in its claws and anchors me to those thoughts. Again, I felt so proud by the end of my writing that I told my friends about it. Not as many though. I shared it only with a few people, but the reactions were the same. Tears and hugs, as if I was consoling them, when I was the one who bared their soul. Still, it felt nice that they liked it.

Recently you have made me write a lot, even this one. I have written about how much I remember you, how having to leave you in another country destroyed me, but mostly you make me write about all the things I wish I could say to you, but don’t have the chance to.

I know these things will never get to you, these letters and pages that I write will never be read by your eyes. So, I started writing them here. Maybe in hopes that I could get some clarity on what to do with all these feelings I write about. Maybe in hopes that you could see them, somehow recognize that they are meant for your eyes, and that they are coming from me. But who am I kidding? You will not see these letters, you will not recognize they are for you, and you will not know they are from me.

Maybe I should keep these private, maybe keep them for your eyes only, but what good would that serve me? You would still not see them. I am too much of a coward to send them to you. Maybe one day, after a few drinks, I will have some liquid courage, and I’ll send one over. Maybe you’ll read them then and learn all about my secret, the one I’ve carried for a few years now. And maybe you’ll do something about it. The unpredictability scares me too much, though. So, I keep these pages hidden from you, yet very public, behind the mask of anonymity, to keep my heart safe.

Maybe one day you won’t make me write anymore, or maybe one day I will write just for you. But for now, I’ll use all the words I need, to write as much as you make me."
Is the Gen 4 lineup worth it?,usairsoft,1i9x2bd,2025-01-25 16:06:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x2bd,Agente_Paura,,"
Before I start, Lancer Tactical did NOT send anyone to hold me hostage & make this post. I’m doing this because I’m genuinely curious as to whether this would be worth picking up, or not. 

I plan on selling & replacing my CYMA CM.620 with multiple accessories, including a red-dot, two hi-cap mags, and 3 total sets of iron sights (carry handle rear sight too, because why not. That’s a feebie).

For Lancer Tactical specifically, I must say this seems like a big step up. There are models for about $60 more, featuring the GATE ASTER 2 pre-installed. From my research, the Nebula II ETU retails for a rough estimate of $60. The GATE ASTER 2 retails for a rough estimate of over $100. Honestly, I haven’t seen many guns in this price range that are equipped with these components.

*Note: the components in the gearbox are also said to be metal.

I’ve also heard about their QA slipping up in 2015, but people have said their QA has improved, by the time their Gen 3 lineup was released. Personally, I think this has everything I’m looking for. Generally speaking, would this be good for someone that’s looking for a gun that doesn’t need too much tinkering right out of the box?

Should probably mention this but so far Lancer Tactical is the only one I’ve had no issues with. My G&G replica had a problem with the trigger, and my CYMA one just feels a bit too “flexible” I guess. Seriously, idk how but the polymer frame just feels a bit cheap to me. Take this with a grain of salt if u want, but I prefer metal receicers. Mainly because I’m good at breaking shit unless it’s metal."

Hello, I've loved seeing everyone's beautiful kitties in this group and the PirateCat community! Our cat Merlin has retinal melanoma and will have his eye removed in Feb or April (we have been watching the melanoma since August 2023 and sadly, the time has come to remove the eye). (Photos show him as a kitten, relaxing and in the last one, you can see the current status of the melanoma in the last pic--his right eye.) I've gotten great input from others who went through the same with their fur baby, but I was wondering for those who had kitties with eyes removed in the past few years, did you elect to get the silicone prosthetic ball? My specialist said 450/500 kitties she worked on did get it. Initially it helps with stopping bleeding earlier because of pressure on the wound (in a good way), but not necessary for long term. The specialist said she's had zero issues with the prosthetic. Merlin will be 10 yrs in May and is a big breed so expected lifespan is 15-16 yrs (though vet told me lately he's seeing 12-13 yrs for lots of cats!! WTH?).  Thanks in advance for your feedback."

One of my friend in masters was working law enforcement research institute for project to help law enforcement officials. Dude took an initiative to work UPSC officials and help them do better job also developing tools and products for them. 

He would travel nearly 5hrs to and from to a SP who would not meet him after reaching the institute and make him wait. He could have chosen any domain but thought it's right do this as he felt this would be a big contribution for all the tax payers money. This scum of red tape bureaucrats have not only wasted his time but made fun of his initiative, many of these law enforcement research institute have worse than a third rated reserach publication and no contribution to improve law enforcement. If an IITian has to face this just imagine what a tier- 2 tier -3 institute researchers have to face ?

Ps: those postings for IAS and IPS was punishment postings in many cases. I am disgusted with our law enforcement attitude. 

He had really left his ego of being an IITian and also coming from lower middle income family He really had passion for this. While discussing this same situation with other students I found same experiences that many govt bodies are really adamant to academic involvement. Even ministries, cheif Secretaries,  bureaucrats etc won't respond till you have any connections inside. I really felt bad after seeing his efforts go in vain. He thought after coming here he could have contributed something. When you crack some of the most difficult exams and come you have some sort confidence and urge to contribute in your own way. I can see that urge dying a slow death."

"Throwing up when anxious, need advice",Anxiety,1i9x0al,2025-01-25 16:04:19,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1i9x0al/throwing_up_when_anxious_need_advice/,Ok-Watch-476,Advice Needed,"I (16F) have had anxiety since sixth grade. It started when I got sick at school (I was actually sick and had a stomach bug) and threw up in the middle of class. I started to get anxiety about throwing up at school so every morning before school I would make myself throw up. Months later, even when I stopped feeling anxious or nauseous, I would still make myself throw up, even if I didn't feel like I needed to. 

I wasn't doing it because I was insecure about my body or anything, I was doing it purely so I could relieve my anxiety, which it did. It would help me think that if I threw up before school, then I wasn't going to at school and that calmed me. Since then, it has turned into whenever I am anxious about anything, big or small, I have this intense nausea. The only way for me to even ease it a little bit is to throw up, but sometimes it doesn't fully work. Even after I throw up, I'll still be super anxious. 

From the time when I was in eighth grade to now, (tenth grade) my anxiety has been fine. Not a lot makes me anxious now, and if it did, it would be something quick and simple, like presenting a project or something. 

Recently, however, I've been having this wave of anxiety. I've been so anxious all the time, even when I'm just at home or doing nothing at all. I haven't eaten much because I've just been so nauseous to even eat anything at all. I don't like throwing up, but I do it because I feel like I have to. I don't know what to do about this, it's honestly tiring for me."
Recently Banned Today from r/Muslim,TrueChristian,1i9x08m,2025-01-25 16:04:14,11,0.74,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1i9x08m/recently_banned_today_from_rmuslim/,TurbulentMinute4290,,"So I was banned today from r/Muslim for talking about Jesus and how He prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. Someone said Jesus must be Muslim because He prayed in a way that looks like how Muslims pray. I brought up Matthew 26:39, where Jesus says, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will. ” This shows Jesus talking to God the Father and following His will to die for our sins. Islam denies Jesus died on the cross, though, so how can Muslims say He was following God’s will when they don’t even believe in the mission He was praying about? That doesn’t make sense.Another thing that doesn’t make sense is how the Quran talks about Jesus being born of a virgin, performing miracles, being taken to heaven, and even returning at the end of times—yet it says He’s just an ordinary prophet. Why would Allah create Jesus in such a unique way if He’s just like every other prophet? Every other prophet, including Muhammad, was born to two normal parents. Why make Jesus different? Why give Him such a miraculous birth and a special role? The Quran gives no explanation for this. It doesn’t tell us why Jesus was created this way, and it leaves a huge question unanswered: If He’s just an ordinary man, why treat Him so differently?

The Bible, on the other hand, explains this perfectly. Jesus’s Virgin Birth wasn’t random or meaningless. It was part of God’s plan to show us who Jesus really is. Isaiah 7:14 says, “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel,” which means “God with us.” Jesus wasn’t just a prophet; He was the Son of God, sent to save humanity. His miracles weren’t just signs of a great prophet—they were proof of His divine nature. The Virgin Birth showed that Jesus was fully God and fully man, able to bridge the gap between sinful people and a holy God. The Bible gives meaning to everything about Jesus’s life, from His birth to His death and resurrection. It shows why we need Him and why He is the Savior of the world.

Another person called Christians idol worshipers because we believe Jesus is God. They said, “God doesn’t need to come down to earth or die for anything. He just says, ‘Be, and it is.’” But if God is all-powerful, why couldn’t He choose to come down to live among His creation as one of them? The Bible says in John 1:14, “The Word became flesh and lived among us.” God chose to come to us through Jesus, to live among us and die for us. That’s not weakness—it’s love. It shows how much He cared for us, enough to do what we couldn’t do for ourselves.

Here’s another thing to think about: If Jesus is just another prophet, why does the Quran say He’s coming back at the end of times to defeat the Dajjal? Why not Muhammad, who is called the “final prophet”? Why give Jesus this special role? The Quran doesn’t explain it, but the Bible does. The Bible shows that Jesus is central to God’s plan for humanity. He came to live a perfect life, die on the cross for our sins, and rise again to give us eternal life. His return at the end of times is part of His mission to bring justice and establish God’s kingdom. Everything about Jesus makes sense in the Bible, but the Quran leaves so many questions unanswered.

Muslims often say Jesus must be Muslim because He obeyed God and prayed in a way similar to how Muslims pray. But they ignore that He was praying to the Father about dying on the cross—the very thing they deny ever happened. How does that work? If you don’t believe in what He was praying about, how can you claim He was following the will of God in the way Islam teaches? That doesn’t add up.

I’m sharing this because I thought it was funny that they had to ban me. The whole religion is one big joke. I believe Satan created it because he was mad about how Christianity was spreading monotheism across the world. He gave them his own version of monotheism but twisted it so they wouldn’t believe in Jesus and couldn’t get salvation. That’s exactly what it looks like—a religion created to steer people away from the Savior.

"Empathy, Alexithymia & Compatibility",AutisticAdults,1i9x06s,2025-01-25 16:04:11,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1i9x06s/empathy_alexithymia_compatibility/,lvasnow,seeking advice ,"Compatibility Problem

Hi all, 
My autistic partner and I have been having some really hard conversations lately. We love each other but aren't sure we're compatible anymore. 

I'm fairly sure he has cognitive alexithymia - he always needs quite a long time (hours to days) to identify his emotions and others. 

He *can* feel what others feel implicitly, but he can't describe it or talk about it without difficulty (writing things down is somewhat easier for him). 

This all translates to him not realizing when things aren't okay with me until I spell it out for him. If I go quiet, withdrawn, or seem down, he occasionally notices but often I have to say something first. 
The other day I was crying - hard - and he was holding the roll of toilet paper I'd been using for tissues. He just watched me cry without offering me any, or saying anything to me, although judging by his face and posture I could tell he was feeling sad *with* me. 

The main problem is that I'm hyper empathetic. I'm a teacher, disabled and a woman, AND my mom was a social worker, so I was raised to be self-aware and aware of others to the extreme. 

I feel like I take care of everyone else's big feelings all day, staying strong and not giving into my own so my students have a calm, steady adult they can trust, but when I get home, I want someone to take care of *my* feelings a bit: offer me a cup of tea, notice when I'm sad, that sort of thing. I hate that I always have to verbally ""wave my arms around"" to get my partner to be ""attuned"" to me. 

We've talked about his struggles with empathy and he knows that if nothing changes, this is a deal breaker for me.

I don't want to change him, or make him be someone he's not. He's said he doesnt want to keep hurting me without meaning to.But he's also expressed that he doesn't want to lose me and is doing some soul-searching to assess whether anything can -or should- be done about the situation. 

I don't even know what I need; just kindness, I guess. 
Thanks for listening, gang. "
"What do you do, if you love a fighting game/frachise, but you dont like to play Online.",Fighters,1i9x03a,2025-01-25 16:04:04,7,0.77,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1i9x03a/what_do_you_do_if_you_love_a_fighting/,SetsunaNakamura,Question,"For the Context. Im a big fan of Tekken. Own all those main games ( 1-8 included Tag Tournament 1 + 2). Love the 3D Fighting and the Pace. Had so much fun to play Tekken offline content (Arcade+Story Mode, Team Battle, Survival Mode and Tekken Force with highest Difficulty).  

It was good until i played Tekken 7 and Tekken 8. Most of the legacy offline Content (except Arcade + Story Mode) was vanish from the franchise. The Typ of AI Opponent of both Games aren't good and challenging like those in the old games. The only option for challenging opponents was playing Online Ranked and Quick Plays. 

But here is thing. Everytime i played with a opponent. There is a high chance, that i receive hate messages, the opponent quit at one game or disconnect of the current session (mostly if the opponent lose). This is kind of reason, why i avoid (as much as possible) to play online. I normally ignore those things in online, but its also hurts the experience playing fighting online games, if that happend most of the time. 

I looking for advice here. What would you do in those situation? Do you take a break for chance, that the game can be better? Looking for a different fighting game, that give a fresh experience? Or anything else?"

Raphael spent more romantic time with Mona Lisa and Leonardo spent more lovely time with Lotus Blossom. Michelangelo’s original girlfriend Kala somehow had already been broken up. He eventually went back to loving Buffy Shellhammer especially which he kept that picture frame of her hidden in one of his drawers of his desk. I think he and she got each other phone numbers in secret spending less time calling each other in privacy as friends at first. Buffy Shellhammer must’ve eventually started missing Michelangelo so much which got them to start going out on romantic dates more and more after her not being successful with having a single human boyfriend due to her being moody at times and being a lot busier running the chemistry company for her deceased grandfather especially no matter how wealthy she is. Zach and his only friend Caitlin may have fallen in love with each other when they got older. Lotus Blossom is from the episodes called “Beware the Lotus” and “Farewell, Lotus Blossom.” Mona Lisa is only from the episode called “Raphael Meets His Match.” Buffy Shellhammer is only from the episode called “Poor Little Rich Turtle.” Finally, Caitlin is only from the episode called “The Great Boldini.”

I know that in the 2003 series, April and Casey fall in love together and Cody and Starlee eventually do too from that sixth season of the Fast Forward one. 2014 Michael Bay’s Michelangelo can’t stop enjoying the love of April and that Mutant Mayhem and Tottmnt’s Leonardo can’t stop enjoying the love of April as well. The 2018 Rottmnt series somehow eventually has Splinter and Baron Draxum falling in love with each other. Mutant Mayhem and Tottmnt’s Splinter and Scumbug has them be romantically in love with each other. Bebop and Rocksteady of the 1987 and 2012 series along with the 2016 Michael Bay film “Out of the Shadows” somehow eventually has them falling in love with each other.

The 2012 series has Raphael and Mona Lisa be in love with each other which they eventually have more special love time with each other. Tcest, a big NO NO due to the turtles being brothers which them interacting in romantic ways is very wrong. Leonardo in love with Karai, nuh-uh due to her being the turtles’ actual sister. Michelangelo in love with Shinigami, I don’t think so due to him already in love with Renet. Casey in love with April, definitely not due to April being so close for the special relationship with Donatello. Leonardo and Shinigami eventually falling in love with each other, the same way of Casey and Karai sound so much better being completely appropriate which somehow did work."
AIO? I 16 (m) am worried about my friend 17 (m) who is in a relationship with a 14 (m),AmIOverreacting,1i9wz45,2025-01-25 16:02:51,2,0.75,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i9wz45/aio_i_16_m_am_worried_about_my_friend_17_m_who_is/,KnownCounter7479,👥 friendship,"I will be using fake names for my friend’s sake. some background info is I and my friend who we will call Ron have been friends since late 8th grade to now junior year. He is gay and has a hard time finding a decent partner these past couple of years. Over time I had been in some questionable toxic relationships which Ron has supported me through and been there for. Back in June 2024 when Ron and I went on a trip together I had first heard about Cam (14 m). At the time all I knew is he met Cam through another online friend he’s had since before we were friends and that he live in New York. We live in Louisiana so that’s quite a distance. During the trip he would call him every night. As time went on I saw many messages from Cam whenever Ron and I were together and suspected something so I asked. As Ron hasn’t really been with anyone in a while he always just says “idk i really like talking to him”. It stayed like that for a while and i didn’t hear anything about really who Cam is. Ron never talked about him unless i brought him about but again it was vague and just that they talk all the time and he thinks they like each other. It’s close to the end of the year and I got a follow request on my tiktok from a user saying “Ronshusband” and a matching pfp with Ron. I checked it out and saw the bio said 14 and “Ron is mine”. I was little shocked cause i was like woah 14? Ron turned 17 in August. I don’t remember exactly when but I brought it up to Ron about how he was 14 and he kinda just was like “yeah i know…he’s really sweet and i like talking to him” “he’s mature for his age” blah blah. I was like when’s his birthday and he said summer. I don’t know if this kid is 14 for sure but at most he is 15. On New Year’s eve Cam flew with his parents from New York to visit Ron. We had made plans to hang out. Ron, Cam, and our other friend Amanda. When they all arrived to my house Ron didn’t introduce me to Cam and kinda just walked in. Cam was really quiet and might I add dressed like kid core from quarantine times. I had never even seen a picture of Cam this was my first impression. He looked as if he hadn’t even lost his baby fat in his face. We went to get food and the first thing Cam says to
me is in just some rude tone saying “why do you stalk my tiktok” as if it was a big deal. During the hang out he made many sensual comments to Ron or just acted odd. He would draw dicks on the napkins like he was in fifth grade. The reason I’m worried is because Ron said he was mature for his age and I was expecting him to be. Instead it felt like I was baby sitting. Vibes were weird the whole time and soon after I got a text from Ron saying he felt like i didn’t even give Cam a chance. In my opinion I felt like there wasn’t much of a chance to give. I have talked about this to many of Ron and I’s mutual friends and we all feel uncomfortable and concerned. I’ve had my fair share of being an inconsiderate kid and thinking I am mature for my age which we all have at some point. I talked to a 15 year old when I was 12 and while it wasn’t a full 3 years, looking back on those conversations we would have and how young I was, there was no business I had doing that. Now Ron is the biggest sweetheart ever. Everyone can’t really wrap their head around how this happened because he’s not some predator. Apparently they have been talking for about a year and they started officially dating before Cam left home for New york in early January. I have yet to have a formal conversation with Ron because Ron doesn’t have much going on for him right now as his parents don’t support him, he works 24/7, and is failing school. All he has is his friends and Cam. I don’t know what to do but this feels wrong, i don’t even know if Cams parents know Rons age because they are making plans for Ron to fly to him now. As Ron told me they weren’t doing any sexual, Cam himself made a comment about them
making out and has some very sexual reposts. Even if Ron is innocent I’m worried him getting in trouble. How do I go about this. I love my friend and don’t want to jeopardize his safety or our friendship."

My dad has horrible siblings:  he brought them to Europe, He found jobs for them, they stayed at our house for years without ever paying anything
When they had legal problems (they were facing prison) and he  was the only  one who helped them.
Do you know how they paid him back? They used my big sister to go and invent lies in court such as that my father abused us and they testified by inventing lies.
Thank heaven the truth came out and my father won the trial.
He has cut off all contact with them since 2011.
At the time i was 6 and this situation  almost financially destroyed  us to the point we almost  sold our house. 
During  this period, no one of my aunts cared about my feelings. 

Last May, one of my aunt brought me to my mother’s friend to speak  evil of my father and  humiliated me. 
Since that day I cut off contact with her and now she asks people why I don’t talk to her anymore. 
Wtf

What makes me laugh  is that they say my dad is a bad person and everything he said is a lie but after they  gather the family to say that they recognize that they have done him harm
Why they just can't  leave  us alone??

I notice that she tries to do the things she did 10 years ago with her SLR, but she doesn't really know how to do them. We've found some guides, I've downloaded content for her (from Mark Galer, for example), etc.

I wonder what else could be useful. We usually take one big trip a year. Two years ago she was in South Africa and I wish we had a camera like that. The lions would have preferred it too.

Can you recommend me any good, nice, cheap lenses? (I don't mind spending, but not more than necessary since we only do photography as a hobby)

Can't remember where the car keys are, your phone, where's that paper I need? But my wife? Oh my god. If she didn't have someone to rely on, she would end up losing everything. 

I'm venting because she loses even the most important things and it's getting to be a big problem because the split second she loses something, she calls me asking where it is. I'll be at work and get calls throughout the day ""have you seen \_\_\_?"" Things that I have no clue how I'd know where they are.

She loses her phone about 15-20 times a day. It's usually in her pocket. 

Every place we go, she will forget to bring something. Whenever we leave somewhere, she 99% of the time will leave something there on accident. The amount of glasses left at restaurants... 

Her keys are in the exact same spot every day (because i put them there). And every day, she frantically runs around ""WHERE ARE MY KEYS?"" and I just say ""did you check the bowl where they always are?"" and then get the ""oh yea!"" response. I keep things organized and easy for her, but her initial response is to just ask me. 

She'll call me asking where her ID is. Did you try your wallet? No? Start there. Oh it's not in your wallet? You sure? Check your bag. You don't know where your bag is? Oh okay great. 

This morning, the moment she woke up, she goes ""wheres my phone?"" ... did you even think to look at the nightstand where it's charging? And the answer is no. No she didn't. 

My favorite one is when she called me asking where her phone is. Not making that up at all. 

So, I'm sure someone will say I'm enabling this. Which, yea probably not wrong. But also i'm trying to help her keep her shit organized. She would lose everything. I have made her check lists, I check she has things before we go/leave and she still finds something to lose. We missed a flight recently because she lost her ID. Before we left the house, I had her show me the ID and show me it was in her wallet. I used the restroom, and she takes out the ID and leaves it on the counter somehow. I have explained this all to her and she says she understands and is trying, but it's like her body's natural response to the thought of ""where is this thing?"". Her dad told me she's been like that her whole life.

I've tried ignoring and letting her find things, but it usually turns into her having a melt down. Then i'll come in and ask ""what are you missing"" ""my chapstick"" ""it's right there. On the table. Right infront of you. ""oh, thanks!"" skips away. Glad I came downstairs for this. 

Sooooo yea! Just venting! Because it's very frustrating! We don't have kids but I fear if we do, she would forget where the kid is at some point.

The Pirates

  
  


  
  


“We should not have sent out that scout vessel. By trying to confirm the observational powers of our opponents we only played into them and have been exposed even further. This is dangerous! We need to recall them immediately or at the very least replace them as they’re clearly growing compromised and are incapable of proper deception. We need to blur our trail and ensure that whatever intel our opponents have gathered rots immediately. It’s very plain that there is too much raw military power to simply kill them, so we must use the fact that they’re already distracted in order to lead them away. Fade away and fall into the shadows and mist, we survive by our enemies never finding us.” Admiral Fallows intones into the debate chamber with all the fervour and conviction she can muster. She’s afraid, she’s genuinely afraid. “We survive by...”

  
  


“We’re all well aware of our own tactics and doctrines thank you Admiral.” Her own superior cuts her off. Grand Admiral Longitude does not suffer fools nor frivolity. “The issue on the table is simple. So simple that the entirety of the admiralty must be here for this decision. It is unanimous or it is not to be followed. We are not now and never again shall be slaves. And so we move as one. Indivisible and incorruptible. Now good admirals. We have several decisions before us. Each a question with a simple yes or no answer. We will debate to determine the best outcome for each until such time that each decision, be it in the positive or negative, is without debate. Each shall be unanimous.”

  
  


“Which brings up the first question.” Grand Admiral Bombard says. Technically she’s the same rank as Longitude, but seniority matters. “Do we continue the observation mission on The Inevitable and it’s assets, such as Subject Mirror.”

  
  


Two hundred votes are cast. One hundred and ninety four for, two opposed, four undecided. There isn’t even supposed to be an undecided option but those uncertain seem uncertain even of that. Longtitude rubs up and down her neck with her knuckles in annoyance. “There is no room for uncertainty here ladies. All who are not for the motion are counted as against it.”

  
  


“Now we...”

  
  


A musical tone chimes through the chamber and everyone freezes.

  
  


“Who’s is that?” Grand Admiral Longitude demands as the tone rings again. “WHO HAS COMPROMISED US!?”

  
  


“Hello? Oh hello! I think this is the right place! All those mysterious shadows blocking your lovely pastel scales! Hello? There is reception right? Can you talk back? Hellooooo?!” The tone is deep and playful, the voice of a man. “Is anyone going to talk to me? Or has my voice done that again? It IS funny, but it shouldn’t happen through a weak little... oh here we go! I’m getting a signal back and... hmm that’s bad equipment. Anyways! Hello lovely ladies! I am Salsharin! Nagasha Primal of Love and I’m talking to you to dispel a few fears you might have. Mostly in that the fact you were tiptoeing around and trying to keep each other safe means you’re safe from me. I’m no ones enemy and by proving you can care for each other means you’re someone in my book, meaning no enemy of mine! Anyways I’m sure you adorable little things have a lot to talk about, so I just want to say, Welcome to the Galaxy! We’re glad to have you! Now have a nice day now! Ta ta dear children!”

  
  


The silence following that message is utterly deafening. The sound of one of them lightly clearing her throat seems to outright echo.

  
  


“How?” Longitude asks. “Even if the Primal had run into the scout ship... how did he do it? How does one do that!? How... how did he so thoroughly hack our ship without alerting anyone? How did he get our access codes and coordinates without any warning? There are so many safeguards that even if he fully subverted the crew we’d have warning.”

“Oh don’t worry, I haven’t subverted anyone.” Salsharin assures them.

  
  


“I thought you left!”

  
  


“I wanted too but you’re just so interesting! I couldn’t help it!”

  
  


“Where even are you!? How are you doing this?”

  
  


“I’m on the outside of the adorable little ship you sent those girls on. I saw the energy they were using and it’s frequencies. I just copied them and here I am!”

  
  


“How...”

  
  


“Even Primals need the occasional upgrade darling. I have all sorts of wonderful and useful implants. Granted several of them make sure that I can tone it down on occasion. It can be hard to be so handsome.”

  
  


“I’m sure.” Longitude says dryly. “Well ladies it’s clear we can’t continue our debate in this chamber as it’s now compromised. I will be writing down where we go next and it will be passed around until we all know.”

  
  


“Oh don’t be like that! I only want to help, speaking of what’s a good pickup location for you?”

  
  


“What?”

  
  


“Well you’re in hiding so you don’t want me going to you, but I want to send you a care package so you can support yourselves better before unveiling yourself to the galaxy at large and starting to trade. So I need to know where you’d like to pick up my gift.” Salsharin says in a gushing tone.

  
  


“... We will send the coordinates later through our agents.”

  
  


“Wonderful! Thank you for accepting, it’s an excellent first step to being an accepted and appreciated part of the wider galaxy! I’m so glad you’re willing to take it! Anyways, I’m really going now! Bye bye darlings!”

  
  


“How does he know our language? And how did he speak it without an accent?” Admiral Fallows asks.

  
  


“An excellent question among many, many others Admiral Fallows. But before we debate anything we need to change location. I don’t trust the man to not listen in.”

The fire hadn’t spread fast enough and Jake had moved to intercept. His feet crash down onto the head of the invisible monster, crushing it and exposing the green gunk that is it’s internals ot the wider world. He doesn’t stop. He grabs the mother and egg and races forward and away from the swarm. Jump to the side of a building, jump to a building opposite. Then a massive back flip, carrying both the terrified Pavorous and her large egg safely through the air to land back on the flying platform he had been on.

  
  


“Hey big guy, you’re not up for election, you’re a noble. You don’t need to make yourself look that good.” His gunner protests and he scoffs even as he puts the woman down. Her legs are jelly so he sits her down on the middle of the platform.

  
  


“Oh please, I’m not trying to look good. I am good.” Jake counters smugly.

  
  


“Dial it back big man, this girl’s already taken.”

  
  


“It’s why I feel safe dialing it up. I can be myself without some random girl deciding I need to be between the sheets. It’s flattering, but it’s also not the time.” Jake replies.

  
  


“Oh please, you’re a show off to the core.”

  
  


“No, if I was a show off I’d ask you to repeat yourself to the microphone.” He says suddenly flexing his right arm so it bulges and brings it close. “Mind repeating that?”

  
  


She does not answer.

  
  


“Thought not.” Jake says before giving the bulging bicep a kiss. “No one knows what to say to the microphone.”

  
  


“Muh... micro is right. You been slacking off?” She asks him with a dusting of pink on her cheeks.

  
  


“Hah! There we go! That’s much better.” Jake says before his communicator starts lighting up. “Excuse me.”

  
  


“Baron Morgan here.” He says before listening and then nodding. “Alright. Okay, that makes sense. I’ll get it started.”

  
  


“Get what started?” His gunner asks as he starts to open a channel to the other platforms. He grins at her.

  
  


“Everyone! We’re nearly done here, the big snake is making a sweep through all settlements world wide with Baron Smith to mass destroy the Slaughter Swarm. Prepare for a massive Axiom Surge! Land your platforms if you don’t think you can ride it out.” Jake calls out to everyone as he brings his platform down. “And especially land them if you got civvies with you. They don’t have the balance or training to properly brace themselves.”

  
  


All over platforms start to lower and Jake puts on a visor to look around. He then draws his pistol and shoots a creature that can’t be seen directly in the head. It falls to the ground without even a screech and then fades into view.

  
  


“How deep do these infestations go? How are they so stealthy and res... oh... oh they’re not attacking they’re hunting. When they’re full they breed or wander. Spreading the damage subtly.” Jake realizes before there is a presence in the Axiom that even he can sense and he turns. There’s at least two blocks of buildings in the way before a wave of POWER rises through the city and there is a warning blare from his platform. Expected energy levels at two thousand percent and climbing. He deactivates it to prevent any possible overloading and moves his hand through the air as the Axiom grows so thick it’s almost tangible. Then the levels start to drain away and it thins again. Like a tidal wave just passed.

  
  


“So was that more Frankie Boy or the big snake?” Jake wonders.

“And then for a bit everything went really really weird and I just felt so angry all of a sudden. It was so weird! Apparently it was an attack from this Mother Massacre lady thing and then BOOM! It was done. Mostly because we were really really lucky in that some of the guys were already pretty much there. But it was bad! My little babies started fighting each other and it made me so mad I wanted to hit them! I never wanted to hit them before and I never want to want to hit them!” Jingay recounts.

  
  


“I see.” Observer Wu says. His glasses are no longer showing his eyes but reflecting the immensely candid Nagasha. Her mindset and recall of things might be simple, but there is nothing in the way of artifice and she’s glad to explain anything in exhaustive detail. “And did the men tell you what it did to them?”

  
  


“Yeah! It was aweful even if their brains are built different! They all ended up in hell!”

  
  


“Excuse me?”

  
  


“Well they said it was like being in hell. It was where everything they were afraid of came to life and twisted the way they saw and felt and understood things. Apparently Victor thought he was being attacked by something called Baba Yaga? And Lu... or was it Ryu? One of them felt themselves rot in the halls of dishonour and the other was in the hell of needles! Oh! And uh... one of them thought he was burning and there was brimstone and acid and screaming demons and and... oh! Franklin! He talked about his! He used Axiom to try and break out and just reset it around the same idea! He’s afraid of being controlled so he was like a puppet and a program and a robot!” Jingay less explains and more gushes as the whole story comes out in a hurry.

  
  


“So this effect that made you really angry made them all hallucinate that they were in some kind of hell?”

  
  


“Yeah! Franklin even talked a lot about what his meant. He’s afraid of losing control of himself! He’s like a really powerful Adept and he knows it and is scared that he might just something go fwoosh and be gone!” Jingay explains.

  
  


“Is he now?”

  
  


“Yeah! Did you know he put his hand print on the core of one of the gas worlds? He teleports satellites all over the system to use for defence. We turn them on and they blow through their ice shields to show up all over the place and BAM! The bad girls get hit by a hundred different frequency lasers from a hundred different places and melt!”

  
  


“This whole system is a trap?”

  
  


“No it’s a nice place to live, but we set up all sorts of hidden weapons in case something really big shows up. No one likes being outgunned, but if you hide your guns them someone might think they’re clever and show themselves to be greedy and stupid.” Jingay says before titling her head. “Or at least that’s what mom said and Captain said it was a smart thing. So I guess it’s true. It seems silly to me. If someone wants to take something they just take it right?”

  
  


“Some will try, but if they see it might hurt them a lot to take it then they won’t.” Observer Wu says as he wonders how to explain risk assessment to the woman in front of him. Or if he even should.

  
  


“Oh... uh... okay. Uh... what were we talking about?”

  
  


“Mother Massacre had used something terrible to turn everyone but the humans really angry, but the humans were instead seeing things that they feared really badly. What happened next?” Observer Wu asks.

  
  


“Oh! Well there was a boom as they blew up the machine making it all happen and then they got really angry and scrambled everyone they could help to scan every factory on the world to see if she was hidden there. They found a bunch of them and started hitting them all, one after the other with Franklin on a warpath! Looking to hit her as hard with as much Axiom as he can! She had a really trytite heavy body though so she had powerful resistances. But he showed her that there’s a weakness to trytite! It’s only as tough as iron and BAM! He ate all her Axiom and ripped out her hard drive when she tried to delete herself to escape!”

  
  


“... A robotic killing machine designed to break the people of entire worlds tried to commit suicide to escape him?”

  
  


“Yeah! And he ripped out her hard drive with his bare hand to stop her from escaping into deletion! Neat right?”

  
  


“That’s one word for it.” Observer Wu says as he vaguely imagines explaining to an entire world that sequence of events. “They really, really dialed it back when they were explaining things...”

  
  


“Hunh?” Jingay asks.

  
  


“Nothing to worry about. Just my personal problems. Now, what happened after Mother Massacre was dealt with?”

Gratitude journal *(daily scheduled post)*,BipolarWomenWithCats,1i9wxek,2025-01-25 16:00:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarWomenWithCats/comments/1i9wxek/gratitude_journal_daily_scheduled_post/,Lovinsunshine97,scheduled posts ,"We are all familiar with prating gratitude. It is an overly used concept that many times can turn int o a form of “~~toxic positivity”~~ and this is far from what I want to do here. What is to be grateful anything?

I believe it is a feeling in a warm tan color in my chest, that makes me smile and think *“I am happy I am here to see/experience this.”* Maybe it is a religious experience to you, maybe you feel like thanking God or the universe for the opportunity to be here right now.

Another interesting thing is, you don’t have to feel grateful about big life changing experiences only, sometimes I am just grateful for McDonald’s, or for my cat, my friends and family for being there for me. Some days I’m grateful for having to strength to take a shower or drinking a glass of water. You can be grateful about anything.

Practicing gratitude helps us guide our minds into a more positive way of thinking. It doesn’t mean you can’t complain (I love complaining lol) but it helps us thinking about the good things we are actually able to experience.

If this seems too hard for you right, try to modify it to fit your needs: try to write down one complain you have about your day, and battle it with one or two that you feel grateful or happy for. We are all in different stages of our journey. You’re loved and respected, and your feelings are valid.

Now tell me, what are you grateful for today? What are you complain you want to battle with a good thought?"

We plan on buying a new sofa, coffee table and sideboard for the tv (65”). 
We don’t have any lounge chairs but are open to buying them if they work for the space. 
For the sofa we would prefer a L or U-shaped sofa since we both like to put our feet up :) 
How would you lay out the furniture and how big should the new sofa be? Thank you!

I 34f likes my trainer 35m.,relationship_advice,1i9wwvw,2025-01-25 16:00:15,4,0.75,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9wwvw/i_34f_likes_my_trainer_35m/,iampowerful29,,"He’s exactly my type. We started training last month but he had a girlfriend. He randomly brought up he’s single now and looking to date. They were only dating for a couple months. He knows I’m single too.

Now I do think he likes me too but is treading lightly HOWEVER this could all be in my head and he’s just being friendly. Also to note I’m a big girl so a very high chance I’m reading into this. 

What are some things I can do to find out if he’s interested and nudge him to make the move? Also this is at a major gym and he works there so I’m sure he won’t make a move unless he’s sure. 


Some things I’ve noticed:

1) he remembers little things I’ve told him about what I like and don’t. 
2) Asks abt my personal life (not too much though)
3) we do banter (mostly friendly way)
4) a couple times he was saying “hi” to a lot of women at the gym and I didnt even think much of it and he looks at me and goes “it’s not just women. I promise I talk to men too. I’m a friendly guy”. Maybe he thought I was judging him?!
5) Since he told me he’s single he’s hold eye contact pretty strongly a couple times and seems more than friendly. 
6) I signed up for small group Sessions. When he had a girlfriend he was trying to put me in a group. When they broke up I noticed he stopped trying and keeps me as a single session at a group rate. "
How Circes vision could be the first step in the formation of The Justice League,DCU_,1i9wwo8,2025-01-25 16:00:01,7,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wwo8,Aware-Couple-108,Theory,"In Creature Commandos, we see a vision that Circe shows Amanda Waller that all the heroes die at the hands of the Princess and Gorilla Grodd. At the end of the season, it’s revealed that the vision was true but could have, potentially, been perverted by the Bride killing the Princess. But I believe this vision is gonna play a bigger part in the DCU and could potentially lead to the formation of The Justice League. 

  Let’s start with Amanda Waller. We do know that Waller is going to play a big role in the DCU, with her even getting her own show. I could see, in the Waller show, Amanda having to deal with not just the fallout of what happened in Creature Commandos but constantly being haunted by those visions given to her by Circe. These visions could lead Waller down a much darker path and leading her to potentially working with Lex Luthor. 
 
   I can see Waller sharing this vision with Lex and him taking it and twisting into his own personal gain where he uses it as excuse to rid the world of Metahumans, once and for all, leading to his campaign to become the next President of the United States, with Waller as his Vice President.  I remember Gunn saying in an interview that meta human population was growing, by the time we see Superman and this could be seen as an issue. I could see the growing number of meta humans and the tension between humans one of the main through lines, as it reaches its boiling point similar in stories like Kingdom Come and Justice League: The Nail.
 
 Because of this rising tension between the human and metahuman/super-powered community, thanks to President Luthor, a new team of heroes form that is strictly outside of the government called The Authority. After an event that involved countless destruction and death, at the hands of The Authority, everyone has now had enough of meta humans and the super powered community which gives Luthor enough ammunition to sign a new act called The Metahuman Protection Act which orders any being with super abilities (Meta, Amazons, Aliens, Magicians, etc.) stepping on American soil are no longer an American citizen and will be forced to relocate. 

Those that don’t come quietly will either be killed or taken to a secluded super-human prison, located in Gorilla City. With this new act in place, this forces all the remaining superheroes to come together and stop both Luthor and Waller and in this case forming the Justice League. This is just basically the cliff notes of my theory but this is how I believe Circes vision could be the first step into forming The Justice League.

AITA for cussing out my brother's GF?,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1i9wwbp,2025-01-25 15:59:36,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i9wwbp/aita_for_cussing_out_my_brothers_gf/,Usual_Ear9018,AITA,"Earlier this week I cussed out my brother's gf for yelling at him from 3am Tuesday morning to f****n 4am the next day over being sick like a toddler.i am a mother of a 1yr old and currently pregnant with my next baby,my honey(28m) and I(28f) are roommates with my brother(24m) and he recently let his gf(24f) move in with him in his room in July of 2024.things were good in the beginning but coming November/December 2024 she has been showing her ugly side and I finally had enough of it 2days ago.Honestly I'm still fuming mad because this B***h had the audacity to tell me to ""mind my own business""in my own home like my name isn't on the lease.im no so much mad at the fact that she's yelling at my brother or told me to mind my own business because of her being sick I'm mad because she wakes my 1yr old up at 3-4am with her tantrums(literal tantrums) over soup she asked my brother for and then says she never asked for soup in the first place then when he sits down she yells at him again for other stupid stuff like that. I finally got my baby to sleep throughout the night so we are finally on a 9pm to 9am sleep schedule with 2 naps during the day wich wasnt easy for a baby to do.its 3-4am waking my baby up hyperventilating with this B***h's screaming at my brother.My momma bear came out and that's literally when she told me to ""mind my own business"" like she's not doing anything wrong.i told her she's scaring my baby and to take her tantrums outside,she proceeds to scream at the top of her lungs saying she's sick and can't speak.she acted like no one here is helping here when i have helped this girl when she had no place to go n no other help when she really needed it.her and my brother didn't start dating until July 2024 but before that she was homeless and just left her abusive ex in May and I was one of the couple people she had that would let her crash on my couch every so often and of coursei would tell the guys before hand so they know who was here when they were at work.My brother is a big boy I have no doubt in him and I know he can handle himself but I will mind my own business when there's no yelling at 3am scaring my baby.i snapped finally and got in her face and both my honey and brother had to separate me n her because again I'm pregnant with next baby(due in April so I'm almost done and my belly is huge).I can deal with them otherwise,they are grown but what I won't tolerate is this bulls**t.i said some provoking things I won't lie about that but I'm a mom that puts her kids first and if I gotta slap a b***h on their behalf I will.didnt get to,like I said before the guys had to separate us before it got too heated,I'm 6mo pregnant and huge.i do feel bad for my brother but I been giving him his space.this is first serious relationship and I want him to feel like he's got his stuff together but since November she's been fighting him on everything and I can't mind my own business when I can hear her screaming echoing throughout the house.i have already considered moving separately when out lease is up but I live in AK and rent gets crazy expensive in the winters because obvious reasons(weather affects the roads,sometimes power lines and at some places rent because some landlords will bundle your utilities and heat with your rent).we aren't in a good place financially to separate yet that's why we were rooming with my brother in the first place.i want to say the yelling about soup thing is the only thing but no that was only the second time and I let the first one slide when I honestly shouldn't of.she was bringing her Lil homeless friends into my home without anyone else's consent or knowledge and we don't know these people.her excuses is always that's my brother/cousin/friend/ect like it will make a difference and none of them have actual relations to her except for we are all mostly native so we can pass a siblings or cousins if the other person doesnt know any better.I have set clear boundaries upon her moving in that everyone in the home needs to know the people she's bringing over because I have a small baby and we don't know these people.some of them are literally homeless by choice d**g addicts who just dropped out of school or recently graduated but wanna live rule free so chose outside over a bed n roof.AK is one of the WORST STATES for homelessness and to be honest I was one of those people as well from 2016 to 2023 I was on M**h,couch surfing and sometimes sleeping in parks or under parking garage stairs cases while actively working.i had maybe 5-6 jobs on and off in that spand and my mom convinced my brother to give me a room in his place so I would be off the streets and I always show my gratitude to him for that.my honey and father of my baby was already his roommate and they work at the same wearhouse so to them it made sense to split everything evenly down the middle for them both.ive always crushed on him since we met years before that but it was alwaysone of us was alreadytaken at the time so no moves were made yet,then we actually hooked up in 2023 on valintines day.I've known my brother's gf longer than that and even though she hangs with a certain crowd she doesn't do d***s,just casual partying and drinking.we always got along decently and now I'm convinced it was just the w**d that helped me tolerate her because now that I can't smoke she pisses me the f**k off and I'm starting to see how immature she really is.i will point out that only my brother,my honey and me are the only ones on the lease but because she's with my brother when I tell her leave over bs like this my brother will only give it a week at most before letting her back in.they usually lock themselves in their bedroom since December because she literally threw a tantrum over me telling her that I need to know whoes coming in my home before she tries to bring new people over for reasons.its not just because of my baby I burned a few bridged when I got sober from m**h and those people took that as a backstab and will try n hurt me next time they see me so I went MIA February 2023 when my mom convinced my brother to give me a place to stay.(my mom doesnt live in the same town but shes aware of what i was doing so she checked in on me regularly)i used to wanna go back to my old habits but when I got pregnant with my baby I seriously matured for the sake of my baby.i have little to no friends now because I got sober and had kids of my own.now I just smoke weed when I'm not pregnant and I do sewing and bead work as a hobby.(I am AK Native)My honey supports my hobbies because I been clean from everything else but w**d.its legal here so it's not really an issue because the guys smoke on occasions as well.i do feel like an A*****e for letting my brother get the butt end of it all but I don't feel sorry one bit for his gf.i just wanna know AITA for the way I snapped at her?she's currently not allowed back here for the time being and I honestly don't wanna see or hear from her anymore at this point.part of me wants to drag her out by her hair next time I see her here and my brother knows this.
I will update if possible because I feel this isn't the end of it all,I know she will eventually show up either to try an apologize if my brother convinces her to,but I honestly don't wanna hear it,or to get her belongings because she knows I don't want her here anymore,we will see because I can't enforce it all and I won't deny my brother his own independence as a person.if he wants to still be with her that's on him and ""not my business"".I love my brother but he's his own person.AITA?"

not seeking advice per say moreso a chance to offload,lonely,1i9ww14,2025-01-25 15:59:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1i9ww14/not_seeking_advice_per_say_moreso_a_chance_to/,moonb4by222,Venting,"I feel so shit. I’m a 25yo woman and for the most part have found comfort & solace in being alone, I’m an introvert though throughout my teenage and early adulthood years I was extroverted enough to make friendships, have “romantic” relationships so I certainly haven’t lived a life of total isolation and loneliness. I must disclose they were always turbulent, so I’m yet to experience ~genuine~ friendship and ~genuine~ love. around the age of 21 my long withstanding anxiety deteriorated into what I now know as agoraphobia. I know the covid lockdowns largely contributed to this, I wasn’t able to push myself like I had done for years prior to covid - I had no choice but to stay inside until one day they said it was safe to do so again and I couldn’t bring myself to go into public spaces like shopping centres, restaurants… you name it. the only place(s) I could go was the gym and I would occasionally go to my local shop, and drive thru take outs. I also forced myself to go to get my eyebrows threaded and nails/toenails done whenever I needed to (which is monthly) as I was determined to not let go of the only thing I could really do for myself. the only thing that could make me feel relatively human. 


In 2021 I lost my best friend, she was only a year old than me, so young and it was due to mental health. this propelled me into the pits of depression, despair… you name it. I slowly began to isolate myself to the point of full blown agoraphobia. with her gone I had no friends anymore. she was the only thing I had. I felt less motivated to try to combat this debilitating anxiety I deal with on a daily basis or reintegrate myself back into society because I felt like I had nothing left worth fighting for. panic attacks became apart of my daily life, the worst part is is that sometimes there is no trigger I just get them with or without there being an aggravating factor. 

I’ve never been super vocal about my feelings, I tend to suppress and deal with things internally though once every couple of months I have a massive outburst which usually results in me hysterically crying and dark thoughts. I dealt with a deeply traumatic break up in the midst of all this and I vowed to never try again with anybody, I didn’t want to make friends or let alone a relationship since I was so broken with so many issues. I make a friend and then what? go out? where to? I wouldn’t be able to. I’d only end up embarrassing myself by having a full blown panic attack so what’s the use? people my age want to go out for drinks, dress up, have fun, holidays etc. I wouldn’t be able to participate in any of that. I’d convinced myself for the most part that I was okay with being alone, having no one but my mom. I found new hobbies and filled my days doing said hobbies. I was genuinely okay considering my circumstances- my dark thoughts had almost completely subsided. I just kept to myself and did the things I could do and chose to be content with my new reality albeit I still struggled immensely with panic attacks and going out. I just wanted to make the best of my situation. 

fast forward to now [2025] I’m crumbling. I no longer find comfort and solace in being alone. 
I started speaking to this guy and I liked him so much. I’ve had interest from plenty of people online and have never had any issues cutting them off knowing it’s the best since I couldn’t possibly burden someone with my issues. what good could I be as a gf to somebody? being boxed inside 24/7? I’m not selfish. so regardless of people insisting they’d work with me and my needs I never entertained the idea because the world is so big and yet I would only make their world smaller. but something about this guy is so different, I had chemistry with him like I’ve had no other. we’ve spoken about so many things in depth, he’s so sweet, intellectually stimulating, forward about his feelings for me, share an identical moral system and yet I had to do the dreaded “I’m not in a good place right now so we can’t be together” I know he didn’t like it but he obliged and we agreed to be friends. this time round I’m broken. I’m so angry at myself, I let my anxiety dictate what I want, ~who~ I want. I think about him an unhealthy amount everyday. I close my eyes every night and fantasise about what it would be like to be in a relationship with him, to be able to touch him, laugh with him… but I’ve stopped because it doesn’t help me detach myself from him. now I can’t even picture being friends with him because I’ll always be secretly longing for him. It took this connection to make me realise how discontent I am with being so lonely. 

I’m so so lonely. I’ve cried everyday the past couple of days- I cry as I type this out. I wish I had someone to speak to everyday. he was so eager to speak to me every chance he could, I miss feeling wanted. I wish I could have friends that cared about me. I feel so depressed. I’m trying so hard to remind myself people have it worse. but the feeling of knowing I’ll forever be alone is so heavy right now, it hurts so much. It’s unbearable 


I’m in dire need of uplifting words right now. I don’t think anyone will care enough to read through all of us but hey ho. "
Stamps. What’s the barcode thing all about??,AskUK,1i9wvy7,2025-01-25 15:59:06,0,0.43,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1i9wvy7/stamps_whats_the_barcode_thing_all_about/,Dogsbellybutton,,"Hello all,

For the first time in probably at least 10 years, I needed to buy a stamp today. It’s for a sympathy card, which I will hand write.

Moonpig has served me well for a good few years now, and as the kids call it, ‘email’, has also been my primary source of communication. 

Local post office was shut, so I purchased 4 first class stamps from the card retailer.

Why are they so big?? What do I do with the attached barcode??

I feel I have missed something in stamp development. 

I used to love writing a letter to a pen pal from ‘Smash Hits’ or a foreign exchange from school.

I feel old, confused and sad! "

I’m now 29(F). I been in therapy, never taken meds because I’m so scared of taking them, but therapy does seem to help better than nothing.

The thing is, I’ve always had a hunch, and everyone else around me says it too, that I could be struggling with Autism possibly. I’ve never thought too deep into it like ever, but recently, the older I get, it crops up in my mind more. Of course waiting lists are long and I just thought I’d come here before potentially wasting unnecessary time and consultations regarding it when someone else like a little kid could need it more than me. I’ll list in brief just me and what I’ve been struggling with, it could just be anxiety! 


1. Noise. A lot of noise can overwhelm me and it makes me anxious and I become so sensitive to it sometimes. More so when I am out in public at the shops. I’ve been using “loops” which have helped. But ultimately it really gets me anxious like it’s just too much

2. Supermarkets are a big thing for me a lot of time. The only time I don’t mind going is at night. I get such an overwhelming feeling the more I do my shopping and it leads me to get anxious.

4. I can’t stand change. It is what it is and I can’t control certain things, but I hate it. I changed my whole job and routine and it literally threw me into the biggest anxiety relapse of my life. (Here we still are a year later having issues)

5. Whenever I get overwhelmed or anxious I have to pull my ears or like repeatedly touch my head, or as my mum says, “scratch my head” to calm myself down.

6. I feel like I need structure in my life and without it I just shut down

7. I get told I take things quite literal a lot, but I can’t say I’ve noticed that to be honest.

8. I rewatch the same stuff, listen to the same stuff and play the same video games on rotation. I’m not open to watching anything new. It annoys me and puts me on edge. 

9. Anything unfamiliar sets my anxiety off on a massive scale. 

10. Eye contact can be uncomfortable to me sometimes, more so with people I think highly of and stuff. I try not to avoid it though because I don’t want to be rude

11. I hate being late. It ruins the day for me so I am always early by 30 mins for everything I do"

This is perhaps the first big weekend for drag racing this year. Drag racing action will be streaming from the United States, Australia, Bahrain, and Qatar, so there is a lot to look forward to.

Beginning with the United States, the U.S. Street Nationals at Bradenton Motorsports Park just outside Bradenton, Florida, will be the unofficial start to the major racing season in the country. This year it serves as both the second round of the inaugural Drag Illustrated Winter Series for outlaw Pro Mod and the second round of the 2024/2025 Radial Outlaws Racing Series for several radial tire classes. The categories to be contested are Pro Mod, Pro 275, X275, Limited Drag Radial, No Time Shootout, No Time Truck Shootout, Ultra Street, Outlaw 632, Limited 235, and 5.50, 6.50, and 6.50 Index classes.

Additionally, NHRA Summit Racing Series bracket racing is getting started across the country. North of where the U.S. Street Nationals are taking place, the Scorpion E.T. Series will get underway with races 1 and 2 at Gainesville Raceway near Gainesville, Florida. On the opposite side of the country, near Phoenix, Arizona, Team Firebird races 1 and 2 will take place at Firebird Motorsports Park.

Over in Australia, the postponed but long-anticipated NDRC New Year Nitro race will take place at Willowbank Raceway in Willowbank, Queensland. Top fuel dragsters and funny cars will be the main event, while the Aeroflow Sportsman Series also competes over the weekend.

In Bahrain, the third round of the Bahrain Drag Racing Championship will take place at Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain. The Bahrain1 team will be expected to perform well in the Pro Mod class there.

Finally, in Qatar, Round 3 of the Arabian Drag Racing League will be conducted at the Qatar Racing Club's dragstrip in Doha, Qatar. I'm personally interested in seeing if NHRA Top Fuel driver Shawn Langdon can continue his win streak in the 4.50 Index class there.

The event listing follows below.

There was no issue inputting my marriage certificate to show that I am married here, however my husband has gone to the rpac/admin several times over there and they have turned him away every time saying he needs the legit marriage certificate when the one we have is perfectly legal and sealed. We even called the courthouse and had them verify it was legal. Time is running out and we are not sure if we can even get a “better” marriage certificate in time. His command is tracking that he is married and should get stationed here but I’m not placing my trust in that completely and it is a big deal.

the inanity of the ambition to spread human and artificial intelligence to mars and beyond,agi,1i9wsyk,2025-01-25 15:55:34,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/1i9wsyk/the_inanity_of_the_ambition_to_spread_human_and/,Georgeo57,,"





the first question that comes up is to what or whom will we be spreading this intelligence? as far as we know, no one lives there. 

the second question is why would we be doing that? the best we can expect is to export human civilization, and take along a noah's ark of other animals with us. but why?

some say this would be a response to runaway global warming. rather than humanity ultimately going extinct from a hotter climate and the wars, pandemics, eco-terrorism and other havoc that would come with this hell, we send up a few brave souls to colonize mars. then we would colonize the moons of jupiter and saturn. after that the closest star system, proxima centauri, and see if its exoplanet, proxima b., might make a nice new home for us.

but again, to what purpose? what would we be doing there that we can't do here? what would we be learning there that we can't learn here? sure, the project seems totally glorious at first glance. what a monumental achievement it would be! but the best we could hope for is to live there until we die. unless, of course, we figure out a way to defeat death by, for example, stopping and reversing the aging process. but, if that's possible we can do that right here on earth.

they say the final frontier is space. that's nonsense. it's always been nonsense. the final frontier is probably whatever happens after we die. and we will eventually all die, wherever in this solar system, or galaxy, or beyond, we might happen to be. 

it seems a much more wonderful project to reverse climate change, and make of this earth a paradise for everyone. and while we're here, we could of course try to finally figure out what, if anything, (i sure hope there's an anything, lol) happens after we die. but until that happens it seems our time is best spent averting climate catastrophe, and creating a paradise right here on earth.

one more point. science can only take us so far. it can't take us to before the big bang. it probably can't take us to after death. the wonder that propels some of us to want to conquer the rest of the universe arises from an inherent spirituality in the human species. if there is a final frontier, that spirituality is probably where it lies. what's ironic is that the superintelligence that were about to create will probably be guiding our way there.

"The Activist Flow-State: Describe it, define it",AssembleUSA,1i9wsqx,2025-01-25 15:55:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AssembleUSA/comments/1i9wsqx/the_activist_flowstate_describe_it_define_it/,Good_Requirement2998,,"Greetings people,

You are experiencing fatigue. Your fear is up. Anxiety is up. Uncertainty is up. The trump administration is attacking the little guy. He's removing civil protections, emboldening evil bullies, taking aim at the planet, threatening women's autonomy, empowering wealthy people to astounding levels such that the brain cannot comprehend.

That truth is enough to stop any idealist, optimist, pragmatist, romantic, or someone simply curious about political activism from doing ANYTHING. The problem is too big.

Let's stop there and think about flow-state.

It's that semi-conscious place where you are cruising through a work effort, even under pressure. It could be a stressful game, it could be during a debate, it could be during a tough cycling session, it could be dealing with a big day of chores or writing your next article. But you get into this state, and more than what you initially planned to achieve becomes more than possible. It's like the truth unfolding itself through you and you are just happy to be there.

Flow-state. And the activist, even the budding activist I'm sure, can get there.

My personal story is still unfolding, but the beats kind of go like this: I heard something, joined a group, searched something, joined another group, learned some things and had questions about local politics, looked up local offices, walked over to inquire about volunteering, even thought about running for office, found my state constitution and all local laws available to read, I now have a project to understand how legislatures actually work, got back to volunteering, looked up political party invitations to townhalls or virtual meetings, found one talking about this year's election strategies and learned tons, felt hopeful all the while continuing to see more and more people asking what to do, started this subreddit. On and on.

I've skipped some steps, but given that I'm a stay-at-home dad and my family actually all got sick this past week, becoming interested in civics has completely filled my plate. And yet it feels absolutely necessary, appropriate, invigorating and self-sustaining. And I don't think I'm quite at flow-state yet, but I do feel like I'm aligning with it.

I'll stop there. You may have your own activist journey. How far have you gotten? Do you feel a calling to go further? What are constructive next steps for anyone interested in becoming an impactful citizen in a time of change? Share.

Let's Assemble, USA."

The food, well that's a feast for the mouth, i enjoyed all the traditional dishes such as ugali, chapati (madondo), sukuma, nyama choma and so much more nice foods the kenyans have for you.

There are so many nice places you can visit, everything is there... Beautiful ocean, beautiful forest and wildlife, or going out and shopping in a few beautiful city's like Nairobi, Mombassa and nakuru for example, there is something to do for everyone and everyone will love kenya!

Kenyans have different tribes,  for example the Masai which you see often and recognize on their traditional clothes, i believe the biggest and most common tribe is kikuyu like the former president from kenya, the offical language which you will hear most is Swahili and next English or different tribe languages.

You should really visit Kenya but you have to understand, visting Kenya is falling in love with Kenya

I love kenya to be honest, definetely kenya count so much people who are so nice and welcoming, I have always loved kenya since i came very first day, would have loved to invest, open a bussines, buy or build a house and settle one day but i think i closed myself out and nobody in kenya takes guilt i am aware that i better don't come back and leave you people live your life without this white man who always complains (doesn't matter if it was with my good reason or not or what hapenned) i gues it's me. I am the problem and i am not that smart and not really grown up yet and i am pathetic, i don't know about life yet i guess. I guess we all have a different story and should understand each other and i appreciate how people understand me even when i am wrong, i will keep my stories for myself in the little ramaining future. So wherever i said something wrong or have tried to share some experiences or where i maybe tried to protect myself and i was wrong to do so, my aplogies for all this. I never meant to say anything bad about Kenya and honestly it won't realy make me happy, i thought i could maybe help but probably i wasn't aware from somethings in this life maybe. So with all this said once again my aplogies, i promise here that kenyans won't have a problem with me again and i wish you people all the best in life from the bottom of my heart. Take care Rafikis"
the inanity of the ambition to spread human and artificial intelligence to mars and beyond,grok,1i9wsem,2025-01-25 15:54:55,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/grok/comments/1i9wsem/the_inanity_of_the_ambition_to_spread_human_and/,Georgeo57,,"




the first question that comes up is to what or whom will we be spreading this intelligence? as far as we know, no one lives there. 

the second question is why would we be doing that? the best we can expect is to export human civilization, and take along a noah's ark of other animals with us. but why?

some say this would be a response to runaway global warming. rather than humanity ultimately going extinct from a hotter climate and the wars, pandemics, eco-terrorism and other havoc that would come with this hell, we send up a few brave souls to colonize mars. then we would colonize the moons of jupiter and saturn. after that the closest star system, proxima centauri, and see if its exoplanet, proxima b., might make a nice new home for us.

but again, to what purpose? what would we be doing there that we can't do here? what would we be learning there that we can't learn here? sure, the project seems totally glorious at first glance. what a monumental achievement it would be! but the best we could hope for is to live there until we die. unless, of course, we figure out a way to defeat death by, for example, stopping and reversing the aging process. but, if that's possible we can do that right here on earth.

they say the final frontier is space. that's nonsense. it's always been nonsense. the final frontier is probably whatever happens after we die. and we will eventually all die, wherever in this solar system, or galaxy, or beyond, we might happen to be. 

it seems a much more wonderful project to reverse climate change, and make of this earth a paradise for everyone. and while we're here, we could of course try to finally figure out what, if anything, (i sure hope there's an anything, lol) happens after we die. but until that happens it seems our time is best spent averting climate catastrophe, and creating a paradise right here on earth.

one more point. science can only take us so far. it can't take us to before the big bang. it probably can't take us to after death. the wonder that propels some of us to want to conquer the rest of the universe arises from an inherent spirituality in the human species. if there is a final frontier, that spirituality is probably where it lies. what's ironic is that the superintelligence that were about to create will probably be guiding our way there.

Chewed up and thrown out by corporation.,Rants,1i9ws0f,2025-01-25 15:54:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1i9ws0f/chewed_up_and_thrown_out_by_corporation/,western-darlickt,,"6 months ago, I was head hunted by one of the largest food and beverages company in the world. You've probably consumed their products countless times in your life.

It was an unreal feeling, getting to be a part of a massive global team, being paid more than ever, the amazing perks and benefits ALL while it was completely work from home. I'm still relatively young and getting to this position so early on in my career was a dream. I was to be a part of a division of countries as an intermediary between global and the regions. Things were, however, not all peachy.

First off, my JD was _extremely_ vague, to the point of me asking my line manager and my HRBP _what_ exactly my job was to which i was ""it is an evolving role and we'll see as we go"". The department I was to be a part of was very new and they told me things were still settling after a big internal change, and that's where the position for me opened. I continued to ask throughout my time about my job and I was given the same answer.

As time went on, it became clear that they had absolutely no idea of what to do with my role, with no clear objectives, no tangible tasks or day to day things to work on, I was only given menial tasks to do which were just to make something out of my time. The more I was in online meeting with teams from across the globe and I was in regular contact with HQ, the more I knew that these people have absolutely no idea of what they're doing. It was fucking astounding to see such a global conglomerate just winging it, hoping to see if shit works out. From top down, _no_ one, atleast for the department I was in, had any clear direction and were just floundering. 

This realisation of the sheer incompetency of the organization weren't immediate, and mostly I blamed myself, I felt like I was doing something wrong or just not getting it. Remote work did not help because I couldn't just be in the office to gain an idea of the culture, work and vibe and I couldn't just walk into the office to be there physically because my team and structure was in an entirely different country. Very quickly I became absolutely miserable because I didn't see the system being faulty, I thought I was just stupid and it was some mistake that I'd been brought on. 

I had one 1:1 meeting with my line manager 3 months in where I told I wasn't entirely happy and we had some what of a constructive conversation of what steps we could take to improve the situation better. We decided also to have 1:1s every month to check progress and have active feedback discussions. Those follow ups were fairly positive, if not 'not' negative.

6 months in and my probation meeting comes up, and even though I could see it coming from a mile away,  it still came as a shock when they told me that they weren't going to keep me around. The official reason they have me was that the experience needed for the role and the skills that I brought had a gap and that it was clear it was taking more time than needed to bridge that gap. 

This fucking infuriated me, because where the fuck is this skill thing coming from???? You guys gave me NOTHING to do. I had no significant work to do, nothing I could really be evaluated on and what I did get I tried my best to make something out of. 

I did not fucking apply to the job, you guys reached out and called me in for interviews, and 2. Why was this determination being made 6 months AFTER I was hired and not before, when I left a pretty ok job for this? I had absolutely NO feedback, NO direction or guide of what to do despite me asking over and over again about what my job was. My team was in another country, I had zero connection with them, my line manager was absent 90% of the time but most of all I didn't still fucking know what my job was. 

I chose not to say anything in the moment, and to collect my thoughts for a bit. 

Two days later, we receive an email from the global CEO, stating that they're making huge internal changes, and a part of the change was that the region i was in was to be dissolved. The same day a colleague who was hired as the same time as me reached out to me asking about me because she'd heard i was leaving and told me she was let go too, along with another contractor colleague of ours. 

This made me even more angry, because I was given a completely bullshit reason when I was let go and I decided to share all my concerns to HR who, listened to everything I had to say, and basically told me there'll be other opportunities elsewhere if I start looking now.

I went to every relevant person I knew and I explained my situation and more or less got the same reaction, partly because they were afraid for their own positions and didn't really have an answer.

This was roughly two months ago and I'm still looking for a job. I've had ups and downs in life before but to be shown and promised such bright future and for it to be yanked away hurt. I was planning on getting a car and now I can't.  I was planning to travel the whole world and now I can't. 

I've never been this dejected or low before in my life. I know it'll get better but right now fucking sucks.

Pixelated Stream on Youtube,obs,1i9wrxy,2025-01-25 15:54:22,1,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/obs/comments/1i9wrxy/pixelated_stream_on_youtube/,ClassicPossession950,Help,"Hi,

I started streaming for quite a long time. I noticed that most of my streams got pixelated quite heavily when we are watching it on a big monitor. My GPU is RTX3060ti, internet upload speed is 23-25mbps on average. I put my stream settings at 10mbps and encoder is NVENC HEVC (since I streamed on Youtube, many people said this would be a better choice), with a resolution 1920x1080 60fps. But still, some people say that my stream is pixelated a lot. I am trying to find how to fix the problem. Can someone give any advice? Maybe that I need to change some settings? Thank you."
How much should I charge for these?,Artists,1i9wrlk,2025-01-25 15:53:57,8,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wrlk,Any_pencil_1573,,"

I'm posting some of my old artworks on Reddit. I'm 17 now, and I drew the alligator in 2020, while the others were from 2021. It's been two years since I last worked on pieces like these because I've been busy studying.

I'm from Assam, and I used to take portrait commissions back then. But honestly, no one ever paid me more than $10 for them, which still makes me feel bad. Each portrait took more than a week to complete, and I always felt they should be worth at least $50. But when I see other artists' posts on Reddit, I feel like my alligator piece alone should be priced at $150(in my opinion for an unknown artist 🤡) .

The pirate ship is my favorite piece, and it took me more than a month to complete. I used a very thin sheet of paper because I couldn’t find good gsm paper that big(almost 1.5x2ft) at the time. Now, due to Assam’s humidity, the surface is no more flat, so I might not be able to sell the original. Also, have you noticed the yellow eye? 👀

I took the reference photos for the ship and the bird from Pixabay, which provides free-to-use images. Would selling these artworks be an issue since they were based on those photos?

Selling locally isn’t really an option here, so I might start selling online after my exams in March. I had an Instagram account but deleted it. Etsy is no longer available for new users in India, so I’m looking for better ways to find genuine international buyers who will appreciate the effort behind my work.

Artists, how much do you think these artworks should be worth? And what platforms should I consider for selling?
