My transportation boss asking me to help him set up an oil trading arm. Need guidance.,Commodities,1i9x9km,2025-01-25 16:15:54,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Commodities/comments/1i9x9km/my_transportation_boss_asking_me_to_help_him_set/,Sardaukar-I,,"I work for a fairly small (sub 20 employees) transportation company based in southern regions of Africa. I wear many different hats mainly coming in to support with their software and then somehow landing a spot in their operations team. 

We primarily load fuel from Dar Es Salaam and deliver to mining clients in the Congo or large commercial clients in Zambia.

My boss wants to break into physical trading of fuel. Ideally buying from suppliers in the middle east and selling directly to mines or large organisations which need bulk fuel delivery - often these clients want delivery of fuel to hard to reach places.

He's asked me to look into this and I'm feeling slightly overwhelmed. Setting aside the fact that I'm severely underqualified, it's a complex market which I don't think he's fully appreciating just yet. 

In his mind he's been transporting fuel for orgs for decades, he understands logistics, he has a fleet of 150 tankers so a decently sized operation. He feels he can start small, 1-2 full trucks per month which I just don't think is feasible given minimum volume orders, etc

1) Where can I begin to dig into the complexities of the physical oil trading market. Something that can help me understand the entire transaction chain from supplier to buyer. 

From the contracts involved to the different types of risks I need to be thinking about.

Where can I start? I couldn't find many resources that spoke beyond the 101 of oil exploration and refining. 

I would gladly accept any resources you have to offer in this space. 

2) How can I quickly educate my boss on the risks and perils of entering this market  - it's not as easy as just buying fuel and selling it at a markup to someone else

Any advice is greatly appreciated."
Ayuda con una piedra,Ushuaia,1i92jjt,2025-01-24 13:38:44,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ushuaia/comments/1i92jjt/ayuda_con_una_piedra/,NoAd2441,,"Hola amigos (original in English below)

Disculpas por mi español. Soy brasileño y estoy usando Google para ayudarme a traducir esto.

TL,DR: Te pagaré por enviar una piedra a Texas, EE. UU.

Necesito un favor de alguien en Ushuaia. Es simple y estoy totalmente dispuesto a compensarte por las molestias.

Contexto: Conocí a mi esposa en 2011 y ella ya tenía a nuestra primera hija. Mi hija, eso es lo que es y siempre ha sido, nunca la llamé de otra manera, pero nació antes de que yo conociera a su madre. Espero que quede claro, no usaré otras palabras para describir a mi hija.

Supe entonces que empezar a salir con mi esposa sería una decisión que vendría acompañada de otras decisiones ya tomadas. Salir con ella significaría formar una familia y tener un hijo. Empezamos a salir en junio de 2011, tomándonoslo con calma. Pero me enamoré de ella en el momento en que la vi. Le dije ese día, me voy a casar contigo (bromeo, no bromeo).

A finales de año supe que teníamos que llevar nuestra relación al siguiente nivel (que era varios niveles por encima de la de novios)

Ese año tenía planeadas unas vacaciones con mi papá a Tierra del Fuego.

También sabía (había oído que era verdad, pero no soy biólogo y no lo sé con seguridad) que los pingüinos se aparean de por vida. Y es lo más lindo: el pingüino macho elige una piedra hermosa y se la presenta a la hembra. Si a ella le gusta, pondrá otra piedra al lado de la suya y construirán un nido al que volverán por temporadas, hasta que mueran.

Así que conseguí una de esas piedras, una hermosa, y se la llevé. Nos mudamos juntos inmediatamente después.

Yo era un estudiante de ingeniería de 21 o 22 años y no tenía ni la menor idea sobre tener un hogar.
Crecí con dinero y empleadas domésticas y se notaba.

Decidí que mi papel era asegurar nuestro futuro, que eso era lo que mejor podía hacer por mi familia.  Así que me lancé de lleno al trabajo. Trabajé 70, 80 o 90 horas semanales como consultor de estrategia. Tuve la oportunidad de mudarme a los EE. UU. y traje a mi esposa y a mi hija aquí en 2015. Aquí éramos solo los tres, sin familiares que pudieran ayudar. Mi falta de ayuda en casa se convirtió en un problema mucho mayor. Pensé que yo llevaba una carga pesada y ella llevaba una carga pesada, así que estábamos a mano. Pero no es así como lo veo ahora. O cómo se sentía ella en ese entonces. 

Ella se sentía sola y yo trabajaba todo el tiempo. 

Ella necesitaba que yo supiera mucho más sobre la escuela, los médicos y las necesidades de la despensa y yo estaba trabajando. 

Lo que es peor, el trabajo me estresaba mucho y me ponía de mal genio. Ya tenía mal genio, pero empeoré. 

 Además, crecí con algunas reglas que les insistía todo el tiempo: cierra la boca para masticar, no te comas el pelo, no te sientes así, no dejes que la manga de tu abrigo entre en el plato, no, no, no. 

No estaba mucho tiempo en casa y, cuando lo estaba, me enojaba o me regañaba porque alguien había tirado la basura equivocada en el contenedor de reciclaje. 

Desde entonces, tuvimos dos hijos más y la casa se volvió mucho más exigente. Cuando nos ahogábamos en ropa, platos, aspiradoras, etc., traía a mi suegra de Brasil para que nos ayudara. Se quedaba varios meses ayudándonos a poner las cosas en orden, pero yo seguía siendo el mismo tipo inútil. 

Han pasado 14 años. Mi esposa ya estaba harta. 
Pidió el divorcio. Pero siento que ella tampoco está 100% segura de eso. Y no puedo perder a la mujer de mi vida sin intentarlo. 

He estado buscando un trabajo menos exigente y empecé uno hace ~3 semanas (justo cuando ella pidió el divorcio). Es menos paga en dinero, pero mejor paga en tiempo libre. Espero que esto ayude un poco.

También comencé terapia (hipnosis), me cambió la vida, espero que me ayude con mi temperamento (parece que ya lo hizo).

Y comencé a aprender cómo cuidar una casa. Cómo es el horario, qué hago a diario, semanalmente, mensualmente, etc. y ponerlo en mi calendario de trabajo, que sigo religiosamente.

Pero quiero pedirle a mi esposa que reconstruya nuestras vidas. Que necesito ser un hombre nuevo, que sea un padre completo, no parcial (independientemente de si seguimos casados o no). Pero también que quiero seguir casado y seguir construyendo nuestra familia.

Para eso, me gustaría regalarle otra hermosa roca de Tierra del Fuego. Espero que ponga su roca junto a la mía y podamos construir un mejor nido donde ella no esté sola.

Solicitud: Ahí es donde entras tú. Es demasiado caro para mí volar a Tierra del Fuego ahora, pero ¿quizás podrías encontrar una hermosa roca (pequeña como una papa) y enviármela?

¡Espero que sea legal! Pagaré el envío, por supuesto, y por la molestia que te tomes de ir a la costa y elegir una hermosa roca.

Si decides aceptarlo, házmelo saber.

No sé cómo podemos dar los siguientes pasos para enviarte mi dirección y dinero, pero estoy seguro de que podemos resolverlo. No tengo idea de cuánto será el envío, pero te pagaré $200 USD, para ti, sin incluir el envío. 
Por favor, no te aproveches de mí. Eso es todo lo que puedo pedir realmente.

¡Gracias!

----------- ENGLISH -----------------------------

Apologies for my Spanish. I'm Brazilian and I'm using google to help me translate this.

TL,DR: I'll pay you to ship a rock to Texas USA

I need a favor from someone in Ushuaia. It's simple, and I'm totally willing to compensate you for your trouble.

Context: I met my wife in 2011 and she already had our first daughter. My daughter, that's what she is and has always been, I never called her anything other than that, but she was born before I met her mother. I hope that's clear, I won't use any other words to describe my daughter.
I knew then that starting to date my wife would be a decision that came with several other decisions already made. Dating her would mean starting a family and having a kid. We started dating in June 2011, taking it slow. But I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. I told her that day, I'm gonna marry you (joking, not joking). 

By the end of the year I knew we had to take our relationship to the next level (which was several steps above boyfriend and girlfriend)
That year I had a vacation planned with my dad to Tierra del Fuego.

I also knew (I had heard as true but I'm not a biologist and don't know for sure), but I heard that penguins mate for life. And it's the cutest thing: the male penguin chooses a beautiful rock and presents it to the female penguin. If she likes him, she'll put another rock besides his and they'll build a nest that they come back to seasonally, until they die.
So I got one of those rocks, a beautiful one, and brought it to her. We moved in together immediately after.

I was still a 21-22 year old engineering student then and didn't know the first thing about having a home.
I grew up with money and maids and it showed.
I decided my role was to secure our future, that was what I could do best for my family. So I threw myself into work. I worked 70-80-90 hours per week as a strategy consultant. Got an opportunity to move to the U.S. and brought my wife and daughter here in 2015. Here it was just the three of us, no extended family to help. My lack of help at home became much more of an issue. I thought I was carrying a heavy load and she was carrying a heavy load so we were even. But that's not how I see it now. Or how she felt then.
She felt alone, and I was working all the time.
She needed me to know much more about the school, and doctors, and the pantry needs and I was working.

What's worse, the work made me very stressed out and short fused. I already had a short fuse, but I got worse. 

Also, I grew up with some rules that I nagged them about, all the time: close your mouth to chew, don't eat your hair, don't sit this way, don't let your coat sleeve in the plate, don't, don't, don't. 
I wasn't home much, and when I was, I was nagging or getting angry that someone put the wrong trash in the recycling bin.

Since then, we had 2 more kids, and the household became much more demanding. When we are drowning in clothes and dishes and vacuuming, etc. I bring my mother in law from Brazil to help. She stays several months helping us put things in order, but I remained the same unhelpful guy.

It's been 14 years now. My wife had enough.
She asked for a divorce. But I can feel she is not 100% sure of it either. And I can't lose the woman of my life without trying.

I've been looking for a less demanding job and started one ~3 weeks ago (right about when she asked for the divorce). It's less pay in money, but better pay in spare time. I'm hoping this will help a little.

I also started therapy (hypnosis), it's been life changing, I hope it will help me with my temper (it seems it already has).
And I started learning how to take care of a home. What's the schedule like, what do I do daily, weekly, monthly, etc. and um putting that on my work calendar, which I follow religiously 

But I want to ask my wife to rebuild our lives. That I need to be a new man, who is a full dad, not partial (regardless if we stay married or not). But also that I want to stay married and continue building our family.

For that, I would like to present her with another beautiful rock from Tierra del Fuego. I hope she will put her rock besides mine and we can build a better nest where she is not alone.

Request: That's where you come in. It's too expensive for me to fly to Tierra del Fuego now, but maybe you could find a beautiful rock (small like a potato) and ship it to me?
I hope that is legal! I will pay for shipping, of course, and for your trouble of going to the shore and choosing a beautiful rock. 
If you choose to accept it, let me know.
I don't know how we can take the next steps of sending you my address and money, but I'm sure we can figure it out. I have no clue what shipping will be, but I'll pay you $200 USD, for you, not including shipping. Please don't take advantage of me. That's all I can ask really.

Thank you!

Am nevoie de un sfat legat de locul de munca,CasualRO,1i8yub0,2025-01-24 11:06:06,14,0.89,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualRO/comments/1i8yub0/am_nevoie_de_un_sfat_legat_de_locul_de_munca/,ExooD,:educatie: Carieră și Educație,"Salutare tuturor, este primul meu post (va fi long story, incerc sa o fac cat de short posibil) si as avea mare nevoie de niste sfaturi legate de locul de munca actual si daca se merita sa imi mai bat capul aici sau sa imi dau demisia cu toate ca nu prea cred ca o sa gasesc ceva prea repede. 

  
Lucrez intr-o companie de logistica, pe o pozitie care presupune verificat retea(probleme masini, probleme depozite, performante etc), dar in acelasi timp de o gramada de chestii care nu au legatura cu pozitia. Suntem 4pers in dept(3+1leader), din aceste 4 pers 2 sunt de ani buni in firma 10ani+ iar eu si colegul celalalt suntem de 6 ani eu si el de 5ani. Salarul este ok + bonuri masa + alte bonusuri destul de mari la sfarsit de an si sfarsit de an financiar.   


Eu am venit chiar cand s-a schimbat sediul si m-am ocupat de tot ce presupune munca fizica ceilalti 2 colegi erau mereu ocupati sa stea de vorba cu colegele de la suport. In al 2lea an am luat si un premiu + niste bani, un fel de employee of the year care se da once and that's it. Dar am inceput sa avem tot mai multa munca fizica, descarcat x y trimis chestii pt x y, ajutat alte departamente, noi trebuie sa facem munca de birou, dar cum a tot crescut firma am tot preluat chestii. Si efectiv pana sa inceapa pandemia in fiecare zi eu si colegul meu plecam full of sweat de la munca, ceilalti 2 chill, no stress.   


Am avut o discutie impinsi din spate cu managerul, care a dat randament pe moment(managerul a plecat dupa 1 an), dar a venit pandemia, 2 la birou 2 acasa, am inceput ok eram pe tura cu colegul meu si trageam amandoi, cand veneau ceilalti ramanea munca fizica de facut 2 sapt de munca mai exact pt ca ei nu faceau. Eu atunci m-am saturat de tot rahatul asta si am inceput sa spun nu, si sa nu mai accept toate chestiile care veneau spre mine. Nu mai fac treaba lui x y pt ca e lenes si merge sa ajute sau sa faca treaba colegelor doar ca sa primeasca ceva, multe efectiv ii jucau cu chestia asta si domnii mei faceau tickete si problemele colegelor in loc sa ne ajute. A realizat leader-ul ca nu merge treaba in pandemie si ne-a schimbat turele de birou. In perioada aia s-a racit relatie intre toti din dept, colegul meu a intrat pe tura cu leader-ul si am vazut ca a inceput sa fie invoit and shit quite often, si spre sfarsit de pandemie cum zicea ceva leadul el facea cu toate ca se plangea cand vorbeam noi 2 ca nu e ok cat facem noi and shit.   


Terminan cu pandemia ne intoarcem la birou toti si tot aceeasi poveste. Avem o sedinta pt ca dl coleg care este mereu cu colegele afara a fost prins ca nu isi face treaba, ne impartim task-urile, nu sunt de accord cu imparteala, spun ca nu sunt de accord si ma trezesc ca sunt outvoted 3 to 1, leadul e foarte incapatanat si nu asculta si efectiv se face doar cum vrea el, dar in trecut aveam un sprijin in asta si am zis ok, nici 1% nu fac peste ce task-uri am eu. Mai trece o perioada, primesc mai multe task-uri pt ca iarasi crestem, apare legea cu e-transport si ma ocup singur de tot - sincer prefer sa fac singur multe chestii pt ca ma misc mult mai repede si nu exista data sa nu ma auto verific si sa fac totul ok. Clientii super multumiti etc facem si treaba fizica zilnic, de data asta il ajut mai rar pe colegul meu, el a primit task sa se ocupe de asta si am avut o neintelegere legata de modul cum se plange si cand e momentul sa zica nu spune tot da, dar ne ajutam cat de cat.   


Mai vine o perioada naspa, un coleg are probleme de sanatate si lipseste 4 luni, eu preiau o mare parte din munca lui si efectiv in fiecare zi e horror cat trebuie facut. In timpul asta I was approached de catre un coleg din alt dept sa merg la ei, dar am refuzat pt ca nu mi se parea ok sa plec cand suntem in plin sezon de munca si cu un om in minus. In prezent, suntem toti, s-au impartit iarasi task-urile si am fost tras de urechi pt ca mi-am permis sa ajut un alt dept fara sa cer acordul leadului meu, eu am ajutat ca sa fie bine pt toata firma, mai ales ca ma inteleg super ok cu toti din firma, mici exceptii desigur, dar all in all la munca faci sa fie bine si sa mearga treaba.   


Am avut acum 6 luni o discutie cu noul manager legat de viitorul meu in firma si mi-a spus ca momentan nu deschid posturi noi, nu m-am plans ( oricum se vede cat si cine lucreaza cu adevarat) si nu am cerut nici marire de salar, dpmdv am vrut sa vada si el ca sunt aici si ca vreau sa fac ceva pt firma and shit. Am primit un feedback super ok din partea lui si astept sa vad daca apar vesti bune anul acesta, cel putin asta era planul. Am avut iarasi recent o sedinta, la fel, se pare ca nu se face treaba conf leadului, si vrea sa ii dam la final de zi/sapt raport cu ce treaba facem si cat timp ne ia fiecare chestie de facut, deoarece i s-a atras atentia ca nu s-a trimis x raport intr-o zi si a trebuit sa il trimita el. El care e mereu implicat in tot felul de chestii care nu ajung la noi si ne trezim peste x timp ca avem asta de facut si care nu transmite mai departe ce spunem noi.   


Am facut niste calcule si in ziua respectiva, un coleg liber, eu si colegul meu am stat sa descarcam si sa pregatim rahaturi de la ora 1 pana la 4 si nu aveam access la pc, si efectiv totul venea una dupa alta, eram si sunati de toata lumea ca au nevoie de tot felul de date. Timp in care dl lead trece pe langa noi la plimbare cu niste colege fara nici o greata si in tot timpul ala putea sa raspunda la niste chestii, ok si el are de munca, dar eu nu imi permit sa ies in fiecare ora cate 20-30 de min afara la povesti sau sa ma plimb sau sa stau pe telefon, cel mai probabil el lucreaza de acasa dupa program, pt ca nu inteleg cum poti sa o freci la birou si sa stai chill.   


Anyways, s-a umplut paharul si trebuie sa iau o decizie pt ca nu mi se pare ok sa tot accept chestii de genul. S-au facut niste mutari, s-a creat un nou dept si am inteles ca s-a opus direct ideii ca o pers de la noi din dept sa mearga acolo. Nu vreau sa merg la dl nostru big boss si sa spun ba ori ma muti pe alt dept sau promote ori plec, s-a mai facut asta o data in firma si pers respectiva a fost promoted, dar na, nu am access la anumite chestii si conexiuni+ca nu pup fundul si ma bazez strict pe munca mea si modul meu de a fi si am vazut ca nu ajuta chiar daca ai studii and shit. Si acum stau dupa x medicamente cu o raceala super naspa si ma tot gandesc ce naiba sa fac cum sa pun problema pt ca imi e frica sa plec, am savings dar planuiesc sa ma casatoresc in aprox 2 ani, si chestia cu schimbatul jobului acum e high risk and maybe no reward.   


Sa mai vorbesc cu managerul? Sa merg direct la seful suprem? Sa mai astept sa iau un bonus la sfarsit de an financiar ? Sa plec direct ? Caut si aplic pe site-uri de job-uri, dar pana acum nu am fost chemat si nici sunat. Oricum ma bucur ca am putut da share la acest story pt ca la final de zi ma simt mai usor si dorm mai impacat si multumesc tuturor pt ca ati citit si numai bine la toti :D"

No One's Home,creepypasta,1i6x125,2025-01-21 18:44:33,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i6x125/no_ones_home/,Worth_Response_391,Text Story,"1



Clouded sky gives way to milky dark water. Cold snow holds the ground. Mountains stare and watch unrestrained. Uncaring wind speaks softly through the trees. A cold man sits on the bench. 



It’s a beautiful day today. It’s calm and peaceful. I’d love this kind of day under normal circumstances. I always liked the cold and snow. When the hustle of humanity would be forced to slow down as the new year passes. On a normal day, I would find myself here. But it’s been three weeks since I’ve seen another living thing, and I’m scared. 



It happened without any fanfare. I didn’t see the sky open up and everyone else flying away. I simply awoke to a vacuous world. No animals, people, insects, or the like. Though everyone didn’t leave peacefully it seems. My house was left mostly untouched, but all the surrounding houses are… well ruined. Some have all their windows busted, doors falling off their hinges and hastily moved luggage strewn about. It looked as if some people were preparing to leave in a hurry and others were simply torn away. Whatever happened, I had missed the train ride to hell. I slept through the rapture. 



I wasn’t in my home when I awoke, though. Not only that, but I was sitting here looking out at the lake with no memory of ever coming here. There was little to no wind. Silence held its grip over all. The only sound I heard was the faint laps of the lake water sliding to shore. I stood dazed and looked around. I found a lonesome shoe sitting in the dead grass a distance away. Looking towards the park of which this bench is a part of I saw empty and smashed cars. 

Quietly, I walked my way up the road towards the highway. Along the way I saw torn bits of clothing but no blood. No bodies. There was a deep rip in the dirt where presumably someone driving away hit the edge hard and tore away at the ground. Getting to the highway, I just saw a few wrecked cars and some simply abandoned. Turning right, I headed towards the super 8 market. “A grocery store with a little bit of everything!” As the ad always read. 

Remembering this walk still chills my heart and threatens me with such dread. Seeing the simple yet all encompassing damage the world had taken. Shattered glass here with some thrown about debris there.  Nothing was freshly torn apart or newly broken and spilling. It all seemed to happen a day or two ago. I was so terrified making my way back through town. It had just started to snow then. 

Finally getting to my home and seeing it still standing was the first relieving thing I’d seen. My neighbors roof had partially caved in as snow covered her living room. Katie lived alone like me. Now she’s gone too. I realize how badly I miss our brief talks. She made the mundane topics of life seem so easy and nice. I never got the nerve to ask her to dinner. What a mistake. 

My other neighbor on the west side had a torn off door and smashed front window, but it’s all mostly still there. He was an old fellow whom I rarely ever talked to but was always very friendly. His wife died some years ago, and I feel he was waiting out his time. Nothing there now. 

My house was the same as the two flanking it, though in much better shape. One floor, two bedroom, one bath. When I stepped inside, my body heaved with exhaustion. The shear stress of making it back home was overwhelming. The kitchen to the right was as I left it. Semi clean. The living room to the left was also as it should be. Couch in front of the window facing a tv sitting on a pioneer stereo. Further down the hall I see the bathroom is fine. My guest room to the right still had nothing but storage in it. Random boxes of left over things. I never use the room for anything else. And finally to the left was my bedroom. Queen-sized bed with one night stand and a full closet. Simple. Nothing more nothing less. 



I live in northern Montana in the town called Kalitfish. A very small town of about 5,000. We sit at the top of lake Rockhead, facing south. The nearest town is over an hour away, and in any other apocalyptic event, I’d say this wouldn’t be too bad a spot to hold out. But with everything gone I’d say I’m dead already. I’ve been scrounging for food around here as best I can, but there really isn’t much left. I got left the scraps. If I could find a vehicle with gas still in it, I don’t really know where I would go. I imagine the rest of the world is like this. Yes, I’d get more food but what then? Plus it’s been snowing a good bit up here already and by this point the roads are probably impassable. 



I had hung around my house in a haze of crying and confused disbelief for a few days. Using up my currently available resources. I didn’t dare make too much noise, for a time when I didn’t know if whatever took everyone might have still been around. But by about the 6th day I went out to the street in a grief riddled daze and started to scream. Hoping to call whatever took them all away would come get me. But nothing ever came. 

I calmed myself down and reset my mind. Simply trying to rationalize what my situation is. Then I went exploring. 

A bit more confident after not getting immediately killed by some creature, I poked into some houses to see what I can gather. Some untouched houses had some good stuff. One had half a pantry of canned beans. Some real survival shit there. Others were pretty cleaned out, and some had been damaged and rotted beyond safe traversal. 

Whatever took, everyone really wasn't concerned about how. And the ones being taken did whatever they could to try and get away. Which left me having to pick at ripped rice bags. 



Going into the rest of my little town, I found more destruction. The snow was piling up pretty good down Main Street. Some cars on the strip were actually not all that bad. One SUV was in very good shape compared to all I’ve seen. However, it didn’t have anything of use in it. Just an insurance card in the glove box. 

Many of the shops were broken and disheveled. The Electronica shop looked to have been looted in someone’s last ditch attempt at a new CRT. It lay smashed on the ground some feet away from the window. 

 I had to dig my way into the hardware shop. It was particularly bad in here. Several shelves were knocked over, and the register was in pieces. Tools, wires, and PVC pipes were strung out everywhere. A hole in the corner part of the roof let in a stream of white snow. Still warmer than outside, but much too cold to stay. I had gone in there to grab myself a pad lock because I had started to… act up at night.



 I don’t know if it’s the stress or if I’m simply going off it, but I’ve started to sleepwalk. And I mean really hard. The first night it happened, I slept very soundly. But at about 2:00 I woke up and found myself standing at the end of my bed facing my door. It concerned me because I’ve never had bouts of sleeping walking before, but under the current circumstances I guessed it was stress and moved on. The next night I woke up about the same time, but I was facing my front door. Though just my body was. My head was fully turned to the right and looked at my living room. Like I was taking it in before leaving the house. I was suitably freaked out by what my body was doing whilst I slept. I decided to give myself a huge “day off” to try and alleviate this problem. Staying inside and trying to live my normal routine while the outside froze. The power has somehow been able to stay on this entire time. Damn lucky with how the weathers been. 

The third night made me get the padlock. 



I awoke to the bitter biting of freezing wind and snow. My eyes barely could open to see where I even was with how bad it was blowing that night. I quickly turned around hoping to find my house and yes, it was there. Except it was five houses away from me. The only reason why I could even see it was because I left the porch light on. Half freezing to death, I had been walking down the middle of the road towards the Super 8. Still in my pajamas and completely bare foot. I ran towards home. The howling of the wind in my ears was driving me wild. Getting in, I slammed the door behind me. Barely able to move my hands, I struggled to lock the door. The warmth of the house stung, as it always did when you go from very cold to very warm. In my sleep delirium I had managed to unlock the bolt and handle locks, open the door, close it behind me and head out. Entirely ignoring the burst of cold and the stabs of snow hitting my face. 

The other houses looked creaturely that night. Bulky shadows staring at me as I ran. Mouths agape, beckoning me in for their warmth. The thrown around clothes looked like long frozen bodies. The fly traps droppings. Scraps. 

Needless to say, I was very prompt in my decision to get that pad lock. 



Returning from the hardware store, my neighbors homes didn’t look so hungry anymore. Emaciated, but not out to get me. I took my time putting up the new lock. I wanted to make sure it was plenty secure for the next night. 

Which brings me back here. To the bench. I wanted to look out over the lake. Since the first night I started to sleepwalk, I’ve had such an impenetrable sense of pure dread. I feel something is coming or something is happening. I’m honestly scared to sleep tonight. My tongue is dry, and my leg won’t stop shaking. Despite all this, I still feel so tired. Like I’m full of sand. Pulling me down.  

Ugh, I really don’t want to sleep tonight. But I’m fading fast here. 



The snow is coming down steady, like it has been. If I don’t starve first, I’ll be buried. My walk back is even quieter than before because of this. Despite being in the frozen wastes for three weeks, I’m still scared I’ll turn a corner and find something awful waiting. Or that I’ll be found by something awful. 

Making my way through the roads on about the same path I took the first day I woke up, I'm as scared now as I was then. The cars are now just mounds of snow. Vague lumps like a dream of a highway. It’s a struggle to get through all this. And it’s very, very cold. In some way, the cold helps me move through the powder by making it somewhat solid. But that’s about all it does. If I get out of this somehow, if everything was just some horrid nightmare, I’m moving to somewhere hot all year round. I hate snow. 

The super 8 looks of a monument to ice and concrete. So desolate and foreboding. I used to work there. Had a decent position stocking shelves and handling every merchant that we did business with. There was just enough people to keep it pretty busy most times. Jake was a great friend and fellow employee. Worked hard and always had something dumb to say. Seeing it so dark makes me sad. The inside is completely ransacked by me and those who were taken before.



Approaching my street I hear something. I stop stock still. I strain to hear through the ashen flakes. 



\*thwump\* 



I drop to the ground, sliding myself to a snow drift just to my left. Breathing wildly. It came from across the street. I think the red-ish house. Oh, god, what is it. Nothing has made a sound since this all started. I try to calm my heaving breath while I peek over the drift. Nothing but snow. The house is no more special than mine. Its door is closed and the windows intact. I can’t remember if I went inside that one. I don’t think I did, no. So I have no reference for what could have made that sound. I stare into the white, straining to see or hear anything that might give a hint. Nothing. I slide back down and sat. Giving my adrenaline time to subside. My current guess is maybe the snow on the roof got too heavy and slid off one side. Would explain the size of the sound. 

Paranoid.

Giving myself one last deep breath, I get up, brush myself off and start towards my home again. Keeping my eye on the house for which the sound came from. I don’t see where from the roof some snow had dropped. There’s no bare patch of shingles. I look towards the door. Wait, was it always cracked open? No, I saw it was closed. But maybe from my previous angle I couldn’t see the slight opening? The obsidian abyss behind it pierces my soul. I pick up the pace as I just get past the home and the front door goes just out of sight. I turn, facing where I’m walking. I start to run. 

Nothing gave chase. 



Getting inside I immediately lock everything up. I fumble with the new padlock from the fear of something reaching out to grab me. Once it’s done I back away from the door, staring at it. Waiting for something to thud, bang on the door, scream after me. But nothing did. 

My body relaxes after I stand for what seemed like hours staring at the front door. I must be losing it. It’s not impossible for something to thud out there. The whole world has been ransacked. There’s no doubt that it was just some snow falling off whatever roof. I grab some food and sit on my couch. I stare at my empty tv, reflecting on my own mind, and try not to overthink. My eyes begin to falter. That little bout of terror and running exhausted my already tired body further. I hadn't forgotten about my sleepwalking. I should get to my bed but… I’m so tired. 



2



A broken window gnashes its shards. The wind goes from screaming to howling, crying to weeping. A house delves deeper into frozen depths. Then the land falls silent. A cold man stands by the lake. 



I awake violently. The jolt about knocks me over, but I catch myself. Looking down, I see I still have my boots on? Along with pebbles and rocks of all shapes and sizes. Dark-colored eyes all looking at me. I begin to feel the cold. I quickly look up and see nothing but water. I’m at the lake shore. Spinning around, I see the rest of the park buried in snow. The bench, however, is not covered at all. In fact, it’s stopped snowing entirely, as if to keep the bench untouched by ice. 

The clouds are still grey above me. Looking back towards the shore I see the long wooden dock stretch out into the vast lake. The snow on the dock seems to be disturbed. With my mind still fogged from waking up in such a state, I walk over to see how exactly it’s been disturbed. What I find is mortifying. 

There are clear footprints here. I would think they’re mine seeing as I’m the only one here and clearly the pad lock didn’t work. But… it looks like whoever was walking was dripping wet. The signs of water falling on snow. The odd holes and preserved splash marks like an avant-garde painting.  Except I’m not soaking wet at all. My sleeping body didn’t just go out for a swim. In fact, I’m covered head to toe with all my regular snow gear. Thick wool shirt, two jackets, long Johns, snow pants and boots. I couldn’t be more dry and warm out here.  

These aren’t my prints. 

The shoe size is just too small and that in itself isn’t right. They are “shoe” prints, not my boot prints.  They look like office shoes. There’s someone else here.  



With terror striking its way up my spine, I scan the park for anyone. My breathing is getting heavier by the second. I don’t see anything, and without the snowfall I’m able to see much clearer. Helpful and all the more horrible. I see the tracks make their way towards the little road leading out of the park. Whoever it is had left. But they put themselves between me and home now. 

I make my way along the tracks. Keeping hyper vigilant of any sound or movement. My eyes dance from one blinding white lump to the next. Scanning past every tree to catch an angle on whoever was taking a stroll. Fear soaking every movement I make.  I continue to follow the tracks, and they in turn continue to make their way towards my home. On the highway, I see they go right down the middle of the road. Only veering slightly from the double yellow lines. Or where they would be under all the powder. I’m creeping as best I can whilst trying to contain my breathing and clear my mind. I need to be as calm and alert as possible. 

The tracks keep going. And going. All the way until my road splits off to the right and the tracks go up a small ridge towards the super 8 market. Slightly relieved to see they don’t go toward my house I stop by a shed nearby and survey.

There are two car lumps on the road to my right and some streetlamp poles to my left. I can just see the top of the building over the ridge. The grand super 8 sign stands tall above. The lights beaming upwards cast an eerie amber glow. I now notice they stand out so much because it’s getting darker. I don’t know what time it is, but I feel it’s not the sun setting, rather the clouds darkening further with threats of even more snow. And it’s probably going to be a blizzard.



I want to go home. I need to go home, but… those prints are “human”. If by some miracle someone crawled their way back from the void, I imagine they aren’t in good shape. Besides, if they are soaking wet, that’s death in this cold. They may need help. I don’t know how they would have gotten here, but I also don’t know why everyone left in the first place. Anything is on the table. 

I stand, dreading my decision. I follow the tracks again. Still being as careful as I can be with snow up to my thighs, I make my way to the ridge. Laying in the fluff just before the top and peeking over. The super 8 looms like a castle beyond the parking lot. And standing just before it is a shape. A dark pillar. A person. 

I try to catch more details, but at this distance and in the low light I can’t make out much. They aren’t very short. Maybe, say, six foot? Male by the blocky stature. They’re not wearing a jacket. Just standing. Could be swaying slightly. 

Oh, please just let me leave. 

I stand and walk. 

This is insanity. 

I continue standing tall. 

About halfway through the parking lot, I can see that they have dark hair. 

Jesus, it really is a person. 

Further on, I walk. 

Closer, I can tell they’re still wet. 

How haven’t they been frozen yet they’re soaked! 

At 20 feet away, I call out.



“Hey!” 



My voice shakes my heart. Skipping a beat. 

The world seems to reel from the sound. The person stops swaying and starts to turn. As they do, I begin to smell something off. It’s the smell of lake water. The smell of waterlogged dead wood. A tinge of rotting fish and a miasma of algae. I realize my horrible mistake of coming here. 

They turn further. Slowly, allowing me all the time to see them. It is a man in what looks like a two-piece suit. It’s dark with moisture. His hands are grayish. Ears are almost white. The face isn’t there. He has no features on that shaggy haired ball. It’s just waves of faint light and a stretched hole delving deep into his head. 

I begin to tremble with mortification and disgust. Despite his lack of mouth he speaks. It comes in putrid stutters. Foaming, bubbling, coughing words spray forth. 



“…is deep-p-p….d-dar-rk…beautiful-l-l…” 



Water streams down his pale neck. 

My eyes stare wild. I can’t move! I can’t run!

More gurgling emerges from the man. He takes one lumbering step towards me. I’m frozen but screaming inside. Run damnit! 

The man’s hand begins to twitch violently. Twisted spasms take his fingers and bend them in all directions impossible to the human hand. The sudden movement kicks my legs into overdrive. I run right. Lunging through the snow as fast as I can manage. Stupid terror sprints through my senses. I’m numb with it. I recognize the drift where I once hid before and head to the other side, trying to break line of sight. I continue up my road, heaving my legs through the darkening wastes. Small flecks begin to fall once more. I didn’t even notice the wind starting to scream. 



I burst inside my home and, faster than I’ve ever before, lock the door. I jump over to the front window and draw the curtains. Panting I stop to assess. 

“Ok…ok. That thing probably didn’t see me head off here.” 

Then realization strikes me. 

“Oh god-damn, my tracks!” I half shout, startling myself. The exact way I found him is how he’ll find me. I have to do something. I look out my front window. The snow is starting to really come down. The wind is streaming the fluffy crystals forward at an alarming speed. Something catches my eye through the veil. The houses across the street look squashed. No, they look completely collapsed. Sunken. I run to my small kitchen window. The old man’s house is just four vacant walls now. Absolutely ruined. Knowing how Katie’s house looked, I assume it’s even worse now. My house seems to be the only place nearby that isn’t a pile of wood and shingles. 

“I’m a shining beacon for that thing to come knocking now.”

I slump next to my counter. 

“I’m screwed. So screwed.” I let out a small laugh at my situation. 

“What the hell did I do in life to get this shit of a straw.”

I don’t know what to do. My mind swims with the horrors. His soaking wet body. His hole face that bubbled with words. He must have just come from the lake.

“Whatever the hell that means.” I softly speak. 

 I decide that lying down and letting whatever he is take me might be worse than freezing or starving. So I start barricading myself in. Get my couch barred against the front door. Rip off cabinet doors to patch up the windows. One in the kitchen, one in the living room, and one above my bed. I brace my coffee table against the couch to further stop anything from even attempting coming through. My bed frame was just big enough to cover my larger front window. There are enough cracks for me to see through to the white hell burning outside. I refuse to sleep tonight. I set my tv on the floor next to the living room window. White knuckling a steak knife. Watching. 



My bedside clock reads 11:45. It’s pitch black out. I don’t have any lights on, hoping to not attract any more attention. I’ve been scanning the street for anything besides snow to shamble by. Waiting for him to show up at my door. 

The wind has done nothing but howl. Screeching around my home with reckless disregard for anything not nailed down. The flakes falling now are thick to an unholy degree. Snowballs pelting my poor town to death. Burying its corpse. Entombing me. Trying to listen through the wind is fruitless. Its cacophony is unsettling and forceful. Even if I did want to sleep it would be a struggle. 

I’ve managed well to stay awake so far, but there’s plenty of night to come. My bone's creek from sitting in this mummified position. Staring relentlessly, my eyes are dry and my head hurts. A dull pulse, most likely due to the drop in adrenaline. My feet ache from these ill-fitting boots. I’m not risking taking all my gear off just in case I decide to pass out and leave once again. Though that would be quite the task now. I’m really feeling the effects of my mad dash home. My mind still spins with the soaked man’s image. 

The clock reads midnight. 



3 



Deep sharp snow piercing through cloth. Oceans of shale clouds crash above. Ever gentle flakes fall without a word. Icy footsteps. A cold man lies on the ground. 



 My head rings with pain. My left eye sees through a red tint. Through my fogged vision, I see nothing but white. I’m outside again. But the clouds seem very close. I open my eyes wide to try and understand what I’m looking at. It’s my ceiling, not clouds. So I’m still inside. I groan as the rest of me wakes up. My right side ribs scream out in protest. My left foot cries. The cold nibbles at my skin. What happened? 

Through much effort and even more pain, I gradually sit up. My world spins for a sec and I almost vomit. My home is a mess. From where I’m sitting at the left wall of the living room, I see destruction. The tv is shattered. The stereo is thrown on its side and smashed. Almost all the drawers in the kitchen have been strung out and tossed. There are splotches of blood. The floor is sopping wet and snow is lightly floating in from the hall. 

I sit trying to understand what happened. I can’t remember much. What I do remember comes in flashes. I see my bathroom and the one small window smashed in. The one I forgot. The one I expected nothing to be able to get through. Then I remember pain. Images of something hitting me appear as consciousness leaks back into me. My head got rammed against the hallway wall. I was thrown. I fought back with animal like cruelty. Then all blank from there. 

My barricades are still standing where I fastened them before. Though they had clearly taken a beating. I try to stand and through so much pain I make it upright. Leaning against the wall and holding my side, I peer around the corner towards my bathroom. Snow is pouring in from outside. It’s light out and not at all windy but still snowing like mad. I look at my guest room. The door is on the floor but not much inside the room seems not to have been touched. Then I look to my bedroom. The door is in half and I can’t see into the room at all from where I’m leaning.  

I take a few short breaths and start to slide my way along the hallway to take in the damage. 



\*crack\* 



I freeze. Silence engulfs the house. I hold my breath, listening. 



\*snap\* 



Another deep pop follows. Then another. 

I stand straight up and start to back away from the bedroom. My eyes stare at the doorway, split between red and normal vision. My left eye is just a fuzzy mess from the blood that has leaked into it. But I know what I’m seeing. 

A gray, festering hand grabs the door frame. Gripping hard it pulls. A carpeted sliding follows the movement. The hand grabs further in the hall, ripping at the floor. I back away further but fall, not noticing the end of the wall. Pain rings out in my mind. The hand takes no time to keep pulling. Shaggy leach like hair appears. Its pitted face emerges slobbering. Gurgling fills the room. The soaked man sloughs further forward.  His left shoulder is dangling well behind where it should be. Holding by a thread of rubbery flesh and cloth. He pulls further. I scoot myself back towards my living room unable to look away. My mind screams with fear. The soaked man sings. 

“..is deep-p .. i-is da-a-rk… is beautiful..”

He spasms again violently, this time his head rakes right around. Fully breaking its own neck. And yet, he still pulls. And yet, he still sings. 

“…s-soo daaark-k … sooo..DEEP…so beautiful..”

As he pulls more, his head slowly twists back into place. Making rancid sounds of bone snapping and clumping back into place. 

I’ve seen enough. I have to leave. 

He continues forward along the ground crawling at me. All the while he sings the same phrase over and over and over. I spin around and start tearing at the bed frame. I rip my nail of my right middle finger. I don’t even flinch from the pain. I tear more boards away. 

“….daa-ark…”

More sounds of horrible spasms and crushing bone. 

“ …and beautifu-ll”

Thick wet snaps like breaking zucchini. 

I tear enough away to get to the window. I start to punch at the glass. 

“..iiiiSs-ss deeeeeep..”

My fist is bloody, but it’s working. 

I hear a wet snipping sound, followed by a weak “thwump” on the carpet. I take half a look behind me. The soaked man is standing now, and his arm has finally fallen away. I start to scream as I punch through the glass. It tears up my jacketed arm and draws blood. I squirm my way through the now shattered window. Getting glass stuck in my hands and knees as I escape. I braced myself expecting a small fall but the snow is so built up I just slide out. Pain swallows me. I regain my feet and limply begin to run. I look back as I go, just in time to catch a madly spiraling hand rip through the opening. Finding nothing, the hand recedes. 



I force myself to keep a steady but horribly painful pace. I can’t see more than a house away. A deep fog has laid itself down on Kalitfish. I frantically look for anything I can run too. The house closest to me is nothing but splinters and a mailbox. I limp forward. The next house comes into view, but it’s just the front facing wall left. 

“Damnit why” I whimper

Just then I look farther down the road and see and orange glow. The grand Super 8 sign lights beckon me towards them. I run. 

The snow trailing behind me has streaks of red. Painting a grizzly image. Some drifts reach up to my face in impenetrable mounds. I run around them, trying to keep the lights within my sight. My focus is purely on those lights, but in my peripheral I catch a human figure just a few feet from me on my right. I don’t stop. I hear more gurgling. Higher pitched than the soaked man’s normal babbling. Further on, I get a glimpse of two figures off to my left. One was on the ground but still reaching up towards the second. The other stood over them with an axe. She took the others legs. I pass, stifling a scream as I hear them both sing that broken tune. More sickly voices sing to my right, but I don’t see where from. I’m just a block away from the lights. 

I’ve lost my left boot at some point. I don’t pay it a moments thought before I realize I made it. The snow thins out significantly going on the blacktop parking lot. I move closer to the sign. It’s lights blazing upward letting me read “SUPER 8 MARKET”

However, the lights are shining off something else. No, this is wrong. The sign is now standing dead center in front of the main building. It’s no longer at the edge of the lot. I slow my approach. The sign stands proud right in front of the entrance. The building has become a brutalist symbol of horror. No paint, no other windows, just one gaping maw and the depths of an abyss within. 



I stand defeated. This world won’t let me be. It just led me to something else. I don’t know what I was expecting. 

“Fucking why?!” I scream into the void. 

A smell answers me. I retch instantly. Heaving, I fall to my knees. Giving up my guts from the smell. It’s like the soaked man but far stronger. The smell of rot way more present than ever before. With my eyes bulging, I look up towards the opening. I see a glint of very faint orbs flash in the dark. Metallic eyes stare back at me. Something heard me. 

A sixteen fingered hand smashes down through the doorway. I feel as its immense force rattles the ground. The arm is a sinewy mess of very skinny and taught, to bulging tumorous masses. The color like that of dead bodies. The texture was smooth like dolphin's skin. The hand flexes as a wet squelching sliding sound rings out. 

A failed imitation of a head and face comes forth. Great mercury eyes gaze crazily at me. Two small, bottomless pupils spill into my mind. Making me feel like my head is splitting open. The mouth a gash where one would think to add it. A viscous drool slides down its chin. Another many fingered hand reaches forward. Bloats of puss stick out around its wrist. It’s long pale fingernail pokes at my temple. 

I scream. 

 Thousands of voices scream at my consciousness. All saying: 



“The lake is oh so beautiful. So deep. So dark. The lake is loving and sweet. So sensual and lustful”



I scream louder. I scream harder. I scream until I see blood fly out of my mouth. I scream until darkness fill my mind. I scream until my head splits in two. 



4



As I sit up, I feel the bench below me. The world is silent once again, bar the sound of the waves hitting the shore. I can’t see the mountains or any distant landmark. Nothing but the beautiful lake. It’s so calming and peaceful. I stand and find my body bleeding and ravaged. I’m also covered in a sticky substance. It makes my skin feel itchy. I need to wash off. The lake calls me. 



“Wash”



“I feel unclean.”



“Wash”



“I will. I need to for you”



“Come”



“Oh yes, thank you”



I start to walk to the water



“Oh look at your waves. Such curves and swirls”



“Further”



“Oh wonderful.”



My feet hit the tide



“Ah how cold and refreshing”



“Further”



“Yes. Your crisp currents pull at me”



I wade up to my thighs

I begin shaking uncontrollably



“oh the relief”



“Wash. Further”



“Yes. Your deep takes me”



It’s up to my chest



“Oh, your strength humbles me so”



“Further”



“I shall drink from your dark heart.”



It’s up to my neck



“Such beauty. The sensations”



“Further”



“Oh.”



I’m shivering wildly



“I…s-so….cold”



“Further”



The water takes me.



“C-cold”



A sublime heart is steadied. The mountains close ever hateful eyes. The wind rests its soul. The snow glimmers in the sunlight. Man’s machinery echoes through the trees. Mounds are scattered.

A cold man sinks below.

"[ECON] Mainland Tanzania: It's the farmers, Stupid!",ColdWarPowers,1i6si87,2025-01-21 15:33:09,7,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1i6si87/econ_mainland_tanzania_its_the_farmers_stupid/,Volarioo,ECON,"The Tanzanian Economy continues to struggle along. 

Fiscal year 1972 was harder than expected for the young republic. The global spike in grain prices, as well as the conflagration in Burundi, have put a stop (temporarily) to Nyerere’s ambitions of villagization. 

Progress, however, marches on. The national youth service continues to provide a large base of labor (though unskilled), and the completion of the American-Backed TANZAM highway and Chinese-backed TARAZA grows ever closer, not only helping Tanzania, but her most trusted neighbor, Zambia.

Tanzania has received a remarkably charitable $50,000,000 grant from the government of China, which is earmarked for the development of better telecommunications infrastructure, as well as the modernization of the Port of Dar-Es-Salaam. Due to the already extant national service, this money can go a long way in Tanzania, and telephone lines connecting Dar Es-Salaam, and the most valuable gold and Tanzanite mining regions are already going up across the countryside to guarantee better communication. The expansion of the port will help move more industrial goods out of the country.

A similar influx of Chinese doctors and teachers have bolstered much of the Tanzanian countryside, as medical and educational knowhow has brought so many ordinary Tanzanians significantly improved conditions. Unfortunately, the effect of this is mainly offsetting the large shifts in the country's budget from social services to military spending. The Government’s planned mass literacy and vaccination programs have had to take a back seat. 

Tanzanian farmers have been encouraged (quite heavily in some cases) by the government to switch from producing cash crops to staple foods, in fear of future insecurity. While Tanzania had a small surplus of Food in 1971, 72 was much harder, and it is expected that 1973 will be more of the same. To improve efficiency, the ministry of Agriculture has implemented the following programs: 	

Taking a cue from the Americans, three sisters agriculture has been introduced into the more elevated maize growing regions of Mbeya, Iringa, and Kenyan Border. Squash, previously all but unknown in Tanzania has made its first appearance on collective farms. 3 Million has been set aside for the acquisition of these new crops, and training of Tanzanian farmers via short instructional films.

5 Million is set aside for the continued acquisition of more advanced mechanized agricultural implements. These will mostly be used in the Rice and Millet growing regions of Central Tanzania.

2 million will be set aside to provide for technical advisors and research on the modernization of the Tanzanian Rice industry, largely with the help of China, given their large amount of experience with this particular crop. Hopefully, someday Tanzanian rice can be exported around the world. 

All these put together should help to modernize Tanzanian Agriculture, increase productivity, and free more of the population to leave their farms. 

The most profitable industry in the country remains mining. Gold, Copper, and the newly discovered Tanzanite all bring in significant revenue for the central government and bolster the rural economy. The state-owned mining company, STAMICO, has promised to increase the amount of Gold and Tanzanite extracted by 25% over the coming 2 years. 5 Million will be allocated to purchasing new mining equipment, and 4 million will be allocated to security for the mines and fighting wildcat mining. It is necessary for the functioning of the economy for all mining revenues to pass through STAMICO.

Overall, slow and steady wins the race in mainland Tanzania. The worldwide grain crisis has made any economic moves significantly more conservative than planned."

Dat fiind faptul ca avea nevoie de bani, Antonescu a început să trimită cât mai multe note informative si cat mai ""poetic"" realizate, adica cuprinzand o serie de inventii si de nascociri, care nu aveau nimic de-a face cu realitatea despre diversi oameni care erau in anturajul sau, prieteni sau dusmani. 

Acest lucru il afirma chiar ofiterul al carui informator era... ""Motivat de bani - pentru fiecare nota informativa primea 300 de lei de pe vremea lui Ceausescu, in conditiile in care un salariu de profesor era cam de 2.000 de lei, deci era platit bine, Crin Antonescu a inceput sa imi furnizeze din ce in ce mai multe astfel de note informative, majoritatea, inventate, ca in literatura, la care pretindea ca se pricepe, despre oameni reali din anturajul sau (colegi, prieteni, iubite etc)"", spune Ioan Ichim, cadru al Securitatii tulcene.

Cum aceste note informative incepeau sa fie din ce in ce mai multe, se pare ca locul initial de intalnire si de predare, restaurantul Danubius din Tulcea nu a mai fost suficient, astfel incatSecuritatea l-a invitat la un apartament conspirativ, unde sa-si predea notele, respectiv pe strada Pacii. ""Banii pentru imaginatia sa bolnava si-i primea prin CEC, fiind depusi in contul sau, la CEC Tulcea de pe strada Isaccei"" isi aminteste fostul sef al lui Ichim, Pavel Ionescu. ""Avea o fire care ""stia"" sa se bage in sufletul tau cu forta, pentru a se face apreciat, deosebit de ""prietenos"" cu toata lumea, nu fara interes desigur, asa cum a ramas pana azi"" spune aceeasi sursa din fosta Securitate a Statului.

""Dosarul lui Crin Antonescu este unul deosebit de amplu si are numarul 2456sca/ DSS 01429.
In tinerete, printre principalele sale atributii era aceea de a spiona copii, multi dintre ei chiar elevi de-ai sai, pentru a afla ce au parintii lor in cap, daca se plang de saracie, daca injura partidul, daca nu sunt de acord cu Ceausescu etc. Bineinteles ca pe langa ceea ce-i spuneau adolescentii oamenilor din Tulcea, le mai inflorea si el. In paralel, a dus o viata amoroasa deosebit de tumultoasa, la vremea respectiva fiind cercetat de militie pentru intretinere de relatii cu minore"" - spune Ioan Ichim, fost ofiter al Securitatii din Tulcea. Astfel incat, asa cum Securitatea cunoaste, el are chiar si un copil din flori, un baiat, pe nume Andrei, conceput cu o minora. Pentru a musamaliza cazul, la vremea aceea mai-marii Securitatii au aranjat fetei o casatorie de forma cu un cetatean moldovean. Femeia se numeste Slavka Popov, iar sotul sau, Ioan Atodiresei. Andrei Atodiresei este de fapt fiul lui Crin Antonescu, despre care nimeni in afara de parinti si de Securitatea din Romania nu cunoaste absolut nimic. Activitatea de turnatorie a lui Crin Antonescu, in special cea legata de copii nu s-a oprit aici.

I s-a dat misiune sa se ocupe de copiii ai caror parinti erau urmariti de Securitate, cu care avea abilitatea de a se imprieteni repede, facandu-li-se ""simpatic"". 

Deși în 2011 nega cu vehementa colaborarea cu Secu, apoi nu a mai negat, ba chiar povestea amuzat cum ""ii ducea de nas"" pe cei de la Securitate, cum își turna iubitele și prietenii. Zâmbitor, ca și cum ar fi spus că a mâncat un sendviș cu ""parizel"", afirma că el nu a făcut poliție politică, ci ca ceea ce făcea era ""literatură"" și ""basme"" ca să le ia banii!

 Să încep abrupt: sunt ferm convins că toată povestea pe care băsiștii au însăilat-o pentru a-i lipi lui Crin Antonescu porecla „Căcărău” e falsă. Sunt ferm convins de asta și fix de aceea am ținut să precizez încă de la începutul articolului. În mod paradoxal însă, am lăsat ca titlu fix porecla și-o să mai spre sfârșitul articolului de ce.

Le-am spus-o apropiaților, am spus-o chiar și în comentariile mele de pe rețelele sociale faptul că individul Crin Antonescu este unul dintre puținii politicieni pe care-i urăsc visceral. De ce? Pentru că m-a păcălit. Și nu doar pe mine, ci pe toți cei care, la un moment dat, au crezut că un asemenea centurist politic poate fi vreodată un punct de greutate al politicii. Și supărarea mea vine de la faptul că, sunt convins că el, ca individ, nici măcar n-a vrut să mă păcălească. Pare paradoxal, însă chestiunea e de-a dreptul dramatică și-o să v-o explic pe îndelete.
Antonescu nu-i un om rău. Nu seamănă jigodiilor pe care le cunoaștem din politică. E diferit. El, ca individ nu vrea să facă rău sau, mai bine spus, nu e conștient de răul pe care-l face și de-aici vine pericolul. Așa reușește să păcălească, să se strecoare, pentru ca apoi să provoace adevărate cataclisme. 

Antonescu nu-i un bădăran. Vorbește frumos și te păcălește. Ai impresia că are ceva în cap când, de fapt, nu-i vorba decât de-o spoială, de o superficialitate pe care știe s-o prezinte poleit. E asemeni unei mărgeluțe de sticlă: strălucește frumos în ochii neghiobilor, dar, atât bijutierul, cât și cel rafinat, știu bine că nu face doi bani. Are un nativ talent retoric, de care abuzează. A făcut-o când s-a cățărat la vârful PNL-ului, pe care l-a ridicat până la momentul la care a devenit ... captivul celui mai detestat partid al României, PDL. Zece ani a urlat Antonescu, abuzând de retorica sa surdă, împotriva lui băsescu, a PDL-ului, a mafiei politice introduse de mafia securiștilor interlopilor ai lui băsescu, pentru ca, în final, să-i salveze, trecându-i cu arme și bagaje în căruța sa și permițându-i papițoiului gângav de la Sibiu să devină președinte al României. 

Pe Antonescu nu trebuie să te răzbuni. Pentru a vedea câte parale face, trebuie doar să-l pui să facă ceva. Orice! Ponta l-a pus să revizuiască Constituția și-a reușit să arate întreaga goliciune a personajului. După câteva ședințe în care-a pozat precum un faraon a făcut întreg proiectul praf. A reușit să scape situația de sub control întrucât nu înțelegea nimic, era depășit de problemă, iar disperarea i se citea pe față. Când i s-a bușit așa-zisul proiect a răsuflat ușurat! Apoi am avut scurtul episod în care-a venit președinte interimar, pe perioada suspendării lui băsescu. Acela a fost un apogeu al umilinței pentru el. Părea că nebunul curții s-a cățărat pe tron. Nu cred că e cineva care să nu-și amintească acea mostră de penibil absolut, anume discursul său în engleză în fața reprezentantului FMI în România. Vă mai amintiți? „Hiăr ui have ză fainăns minster the ăăă madăr and the ăăă fadăr of zis ăăă”. Și-a rupt mâinile în discvursul ăla!

Poate vă întrebați, pe bună dreptate, de ce i s-au întâmplat lui toate acestea? Răspunsul e simplu: pentru că, în realitate, Crin Antonescu e un incapabil, o nulitate absolută, un om care nu poate face absolut nimic în afară de a mânca căcat. E bun dacă-i dai ocazia să facă ditirambe retorice, dacă-l lași să vorbească precum un magnetofon stricat. Doar atunci strălucește, când vede o cameră și-un microfon în față. Pune-l să mănânce căcat și-o va face artistic întrucât el numai astra a făcut toată viața. 

Că are un caracter mic se vede studiindu-i traiectoria. După ce s-a bătut în piept că-i Eroul de la Termopile al politicii, s-a aliniat umil în linie, precum un cățel care se gudură de foame. Motivul? Postul de Comisar European pe care l-a ocupat nevastă-sa, altă nulitate sforăitoare, în mandatul căreia nemții au făcut praf industria autohtonă de transport de marfă prin „Pachetul Mobilitate”. 

Ceea ce e însă devastator la acest individ e capacitatea sa de a provoca daune. Dacă-l urci pe o funcție, poți să te aștepți ca într-un timp record să pice tot ce are în subordine. Pune-l șef peste cea mai rentabilă companie din lume și pariez cu toată averea mea că în maxim doi-trei ani o duce-n faliment. Dă-i o țară pe mână și-o va șterge de pe fața pământului. 

Spuneam că-l urăsc și-o fac nu pentru că ar rău sau pentru că l-aș bănui că uneltește ceva. Aiurea, nici nu e capabil să se gândească la așa ceva. E prea leneș. El vrea să facă bine nu pentru că ar avea convingerea că trebuie să fii de partea binelui, ci pentru că știe că așa discursul are mai mult impact. În rest, după ce s-a terminat discursul s-a terminat și „binele lui Antonescu”. E atât de inconștient și de superficial încât nu-l văd punând botul la un act de corupție de-ăla de zile mari, în urma căruia să pută de bogăție. Și-abia aici e pericolul întrucât aparenta sa cinste vine din caracterul său de parazit mărunt. E incapabil să facă ceva grandios, dar în mod sigur, dacă-i dai impresia că-i scuipi vreo stipendie de câteva mii de euro încasați legal, imediat va redeveni acel vierme umil, gata să-și țină gura și să lase ditai corupția să-i treacă pe sub nas, motivând ulterior că dormea din cauza obozelii cauzată de „problemele țărișoarei”.

L-am văzut îngurguțându-se împotriva lui Georgescu. Gândul că va deveni candidatul unic la președinție al monstruoasei coaliții l-a energizat brusc. S-a trezit din nou vorbind. Pentru a-l contrazice pe Georgescu s-a apucat să dea definiția poporului exact așa cum a dat-o Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Băi, frate, copiată unu-la-unu, explicată așa, ca la carte, numai bună să fie înțeleasă de cei care-l urmăresc și care-i pică în hățișul retoric. Și mai spune și că e corectă, mai mult, că e cea mai corectă definiție! Bă, mă lași! Tocmai de mi-ai dat un motiv să-l întreb public pe tovarășul Alexandru Florian de la Institutul Elie Wiesel, cam ce păzește domnia sa pe-acolo? Păi ce facem, frate, după ce-ai înfierat doctrina legionară că ar fi toxică, acum bagi capul la cutie în fața deluviilor retorice ale lui Antonescu? După ce l-ai contrat pe Georgescu, aruncând cu dejecții în el, acum stai umil și îl mângâi pe creștet pe Antonescu din cauză că-i mai legionar ca așa-zișii legionari? Închid paranteza.

Ceea ce e important de reținut în ceea ce-l privește pe Antonescu este capacitatea sa de distrugere. În banalitatea sa, personajul e asemeni unui păianjen care-și întinde infama plasă prinzându-i în ea pe naivi. E o formă fără absolut nici pic de fond, un balon umflat care pare un luptător fioros, dar care atunci când dă peste un ac se transformă în milioane de bucățele irelevante. Pericolul însă vine din faptul că el nu vrea să fie așa, ba chiar e ferm convins că nu-i așa. Însă, imediat după ce se cațără pe funcție, caracterul său banal începe să-și facă de cap și, asemeni păianjenului, trece la devorarea naivilor. 

Abia acum pot să revin la începutul articolului pentru a justifica titlul. Am spus că sunt ferm convins că toată povestea cu „Căcărău” e falsă. Dar asta nu înseamnă că porecla nu i se potrivește. Privind atent personajul înțelegi o chestie cât se poate de simplă și intuitivă: singura sa caracteristică este acel imens deluviu verbal, asemeni unei diaree care nu se mai termină. De-aceea, porecla Căcărău îl caracterizează. Și de aceea mi-am intitulat în acest fel articolul. 

Totuși, cât de blestemată e această țară dacă aici, în ciuda nenorocirilor care se petrec, încă sunt mulți cei care cred că speranța se numește Căcărău? Gândiți-vă bine la asta!"

"A Seat at the Council Table By K'thaal, Diplomat of the Vrexath Dominion",humansarespaceorcs,1i5o9wd,2025-01-20 06:37:22,149,0.99,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1i5o9wd/a_seat_at_the_council_table_by_kthaal_diplomat_of/,Shadeskira,Original Story,"When humanity arrived at the Interstellar Council, the entire chamber fell silent. It was not often that a new species joined our ranks, let alone one so… unassuming. Their ships lacked the imposing spires of the Xhal’therak or the shimmering shields of the Keldar Collective. Their diplomats were not flanked by ceremonial guards or towering banners. Instead, they brought something far more intriguing: a stack of contracts.

I remember observing their chief envoy—Ambassador Yates—standing at the center of the Council floor. His manner was relaxed, his words measured. He spoke not of military might or technological supremacy but of cooperation and mutual benefit. He introduced the ""Headhunter Corp,"" a peculiar organization that specialized in connecting human corporations to the needs of the galaxy.

At first, their offerings seemed modest. A mining operation on the volcanic moon of Xiltra needed workers impervious to extreme heat? Humans sent a crew. The Nok’Var Syndicate sought to rid their colony of the deadly insectoid Y’task swarms? Humans dispatched exterminators equipped with ingenious flamethrowers and battle suits. Even the Vrexath Dominion, known for our stoic independence, contracted humans to map the treacherous nebula of K’dar’s Reach.

What set them apart was their flexibility. Each human corporation specialized in a niche. Paramilitary forces handled border skirmishes. Terraforming crews breathed new life into barren worlds. Logistical teams streamlined trade routes. Over time, the Council grew dependent on these services. For all our advancements, no one could deny the humans' uncanny ability to adapt, organize, and deliver results.

It began slowly, a few contracts here and there. But within a decade, humans became indispensable. I observed firsthand how the Headhunter Corp subtly wove itself into the fabric of interstellar society. Economies thrived, conflicts were managed, and stagnation gave way to innovation. The humans had not come to conquer—they had come to sell solutions. And we bought them eagerly.

Then, the N'tharok Empire declared war on humanity.

The N’tharok were a predatory species, infamous for their relentless expansion and disdain for diplomacy. When the declaration reached the Council chambers, I expected humanity to react with desperation or pleas for aid. Instead, Ambassador Yates calmly addressed the Council.

""In accordance with our contracts,"" he began, ""all agreements will be suspended during a time of war, as stipulated in Clause 17, Subsection C."" His words sent ripples of unease through the chamber. ""For those wishing to maintain their agreements, humanity offers one path: formal alliance in our defense.""

The uproar was immediate. Delegates shouted, protested, and argued. But the reality was stark. Without humanity’s services, critical operations ground to a halt. The Keldar's terraforming projects stalled, leaving colonists stranded on barely habitable worlds. The Xhal'therak's military campaigns faltered without logistical support. Even the Vrexath Dominion faced delays in our deep-space exploration.

The fine print was genius—insidious, some called it. Humanity had bound us with dependency, not chains. And now, the Council had no choice but to act.

It was not an easy decision for the Council to intervene on humanity's behalf. Many resented their manipulation, but even more feared the consequences of inaction. One by one, the Council races pledged ships, resources, and soldiers to humanity’s defense. For the first time in history, the Interstellar Council stood united in war.

The campaign against the N'tharok was brutal but swift. Humanity’s paramilitary forces, bolstered by the combined strength of the Council’s fleets, repelled the invaders with precision and ferocity. It was during those battles that we saw another side of the humans—tenacious, inventive, and unwavering in the face of adversity.

When the war ended, humanity emerged not as conquerors but as equal partners. The fine print of their contracts, once a source of contention, became a symbol of their foresight. They had not coerced us through force but had skillfully positioned themselves as indispensable. And when their ""Hour of Need"" came, we had little choice but to stand with them.

Looking back, I cannot help but admire their strategy. Humanity did not come to the stars with weapons but with contracts. They wielded not armies but opportunity. And in doing so, they reshaped the very foundation of the Interstellar Council.

We may grumble about their methods, but there is no denying this: the humans taught us the true power of diplomacy. And for that, the galaxy will never be the same."

"OOCS: Of Dog, Volpir and Man - Book 7 Ch 20",HFY,1i3tl8w,2025-01-17 18:14:05,259,0.99,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i3tl8w/oocs_of_dog_volpir_and_man_book_7_ch_20/,KamchatkasRevenge,OC,"Dar'Vok reacts faster than the unaided eye can see, accelerating past the speed of sound with a loud crack as she pitches a ball of green warfire at a Cloaken who suddenly learns that being on fire is not fun.

Shalkas is moving almost as quickly, though not quite hitting the transonic speeds common to Apuk war maidens. However, you don't need to be fast yourself when you're pumping out rounds that are moving that fast or faster on your behalf. The old veteran has her massive double barreled weapon out from under her coat and is opening fire with a thunderous roar in under a second.

It was a unique cousin to the Earth shotgun. Its Cannidor name was hard to pronounce, and the first Humans to see one had dubbed the monstrous weapon a 'shrapnel cannon'. It was a favorite for 'low tech' environments. It would chip pieces of raw material off in its chambers, then use its magnetic accelerators to lob those shards at blinding speed towards the enemy.

Any magnetic metal could be made to work, though Trytite was becoming a favorite Human addition to the blend for such things, and it only required its power pack be charged every now and then, with very few moving parts to fuss about.

Being Cannidor made, the shrapnel cannon made a big noise when it was fired and did a lot of damage, combined with the simplicity and it was an instant favorite for Humans who could find one in the appropriate size.

It was another place where Cannidor and Humans met on common soil, Cannidor liked big, loud guns that did a lot of damage.

They really were an entire species after Jerry's own heart.

For being kin to a directional shrapnel mine, the shrapnel cannon was surprisingly accurate, it's spread staying tight even at a hundred meters as both barrels hammer into a Feli pirate with a scoped laser rifle, rendering her chest down to what couldn't even be considered 'chunky' salsa anymore.

Jaruna's own Great White Shark sends one of it's massive slugs down range and separates another pirate's top half from her bottom half as she steps around a corner with a primed grenade, the weapon rolling back behind cover to a shriek from the pirate's mate as plasma fire erupts with a violent bang! Likely burning them severely if not killing them out right.

Jerry's firing where possible but quickly returns his pistol to its holster. With the wide open spaces on Primus, Jerry had decided to split the difference and had brought his recently upgraded MDR bullpup sniper rifle. The Wolverine pattern made the rifle even lighter and more accurate, which in turn ensured a lethal rifle was even more lethal, especially with the laser accurate 6.5 Creedmore ammunition. At this range, the ballistic computer wasn't needed, just get the reticle on the target and caress the trigger before sending a high velocity round down range.

With the initial reaction handled and the pirates getting a firm boot to the teeth, Jerry starts getting a feel for the situation so he can issue orders, only to hear Dar'Vok do it for him.

""Nek'Var! Cover our back end from the rooftops if you're comfortable going up alone!""

Dar'Vok orders, as she takes a moment to get the massive GM-6 Lynx .50 caliber sniper rifle she used as her primary ranged weapon clear of its axiom pocket. It too was overkill for this fight most likely, but as Jerry had taught Dar'Vok himself, there's no kill quite like overkill.

Nek'Var on the other hand is grinning like a lunatic as she crouches down for a leap.

""Comfortable? Hah! I was born for this!""

Sword and Tiger pistol in hand Nek'Var bounds up to roof height, pouncing on some poor bad girl with her war sword singing as she lets out a piercing battle cry that would make a hunting falcon proud. She hits the roof with the new very dead presumed pirate under her boots and there's a sonic boom as she accelerates to the next target, blade carving out wide arcs of crimson even as her pistol snaps up and engages another target.

Nek'Var might not have the raw axiom-fueled potential of Melodi'Sek, or Drah'Muk's incredible stature, but she was an absolute mistress of the Apuk sword, one of those rare spirits who was entirely at home in battle. She was completely at peace in the midst of the sword storm, when blood began to spill and flames filled the sky. It was inspiring to watch her work as she lets loose a flurry of attacks on her assigned sector of roof.

""No one shoot Nek'Var by accident, she'd never let us hear the end of it.""

Jerry calls even as he and Jab ventilate the same target at the same time in a burst of gunfire that would have been exceptionally cool if it had been at all coordinated.

A series of reports that sounded a lot like Shalkas' shrapnel cannon echo from further up the town and the white furred Cannidor woman laughs, a real laugh this time, the thrill of battle purging her negative emotions for the time being.

""That'll be my girls. Back up's on the way!""

""Endless Barrage!""

Jerry couldn't tell whose voice that was, but the cold chill that went down the spines of everyone in earshot left them all practically frozen time.

The Endless Barrage was one of the most dangerous weapons in the galaxy, and one of the few that could be called truly illegal. It was an anti-army weapon. Its massive magazine used shrinking tech to take nearly a thousand large unguided rockets down to a size that a normal Human could carry an Endless Barrage around without an issue.

He wasn't out in the open, but a bit of wall that could ablate laser shots wasn't about to stop repeated explosions from one of those monsters... but he did have something that could help. His old shield ring. It was almost as familiar a weight on his left hand as his wedding band. Sure, his power armor had his own shield, and he was adept enough to generate shields all on his own now, but the familiar tool made the process of putting up a shield that much easier and he needed it as easy as possible right now.

His rifle dangles on his sling as his right hand snaps out and he grabs Jab by the collar, yanking her behind cover even as he uses axiom to pull Jaruna even more aggressively, enlarging the shield and gritting his teeth as he digs himself in a bit, bracing for the impacts he knows are coming. He has no idea what Shalkas is, and he's pretty sure he saw Dar'Vok leaping clear even as she vanished into invisibility, no doubt trying to end the rocketeer before she could fire... but as fast as Dar'Vok was, she wasn't as fast as a finger on a trigger. No matter what anyone did, the Endless Barrage gunner was going to get a few rounds off.

The shield bursts into existence as the electronic igniter of the Endless Barrage sends the first of many rockets screaming down range. It crosses the distance in the blink of an eye, with plenty of its friends hot on its tail. The impact releases the 'shrink' effect and triggers the detonator in its system's fail safe. It was theoretically smart enough to do things like air burst, but contact detonation was a wonderful fall back.

The hit hurt. A lot. Jerry grunts and digs in even more as a series of explosions almost manages to push him back, extending and refining the shape of the shield into a dome to cover them from any misses. Just enough kinetic energy from the impacts was bleeding through the shields that it would have damaged him if he wasn't pumping axiom into reinforcement. This was dangerous, but no more dangerous than many other things he'd dealt with before.

Suddenly the stream of rockets cuts off, and the rocketeer falls into the road from the roof, her body looked like it had been stomped on by a giant child stomping on a toy. Dar'Vok's handy work to be sure. Jerry cautiously drops the shield and brings his rifle back up.

Dar'Vok raises her sword high from the roof, then drops down as a burst of plasma fire reaches for her, the shooters unwittingly revealing themselves to Nek'Var who shrieks out another battle cry as she leaps up and descends on her new prey with another telltale supersonic crack.

Jerry reaches down and helps Jaruna to her feet, and Jab manages a quick kip up before checking her weapons.

""Phew. Thanks for the save.""

Jab looks around slowly before looking behind them, her jaw dropping just a little bit. The building behind them had been reduced to rubble. Apparently the now departed rocketeer had not been a particularly good shot.

""This happen to you often? People attack you and are willing to blow up an entire street to get you?""

""Not that often, but this is the second time I've had an Endless Barrage pointed at me, and I can safely say I don't like it at all. Where's Shalkas? We need to deal with these bitches so we can start seeing if there's anyone alive in the wreckage.""

The sound of boots running on pavement with more boots quickly following brings weapons up right as Shalkas rounds the corner.

""Sorry to bail on you, didn't know you were going to do that shield trick so I just ran like hell to clear the blast radius. On the plus side, I ran into the girls. Let's stomp these fuckers a new mud hole. I ain't about to let this scum blow up my damn town!""

Jerry gives the white furred Cannidor an appraising look.

""You know Shalkas, I changed my mind. If you don't want to go back into the military full time, I want you as a sheriff on Skikkja, not just in Undaunted Cannidor space, whatever that ends up being called, but let's do it. Try to take a prisoner or two if possible, I need to interrogate these weasels.""

""Beat you to it my lord!""

Nek'Var's voice heralds her dropping out of the sky, with Dar'Vok right behind her. Over her shoulder is a badly bruised woman with an empty holster and empty sheath for some kind of bladed weapon.

""We got most of them when the Barrage gunner started doing her thing. I got the last knot of them. Pretty sure the Barrage gunner was the leader..."" Nek'Var looks over at the mangled corpse. ""Don't think she'll be answering any questions mind you. One of the girls in the last group managed to throw her weapons down and kiss dirt."" She hefts the groaning body over her shoulder by way of demonstration. ""Should I teleport her back to the Tear?""

""Eventually. Call Judge Rauxtim, I want her bailiffs to assist Shalkas and her girls in making sure the village is completely clear of pirates and we've picked up all their gear. Intelligence will want to tear through all of it... but this one. Set her down.""

Nek'Var quickly puts the bound and gagged Horchka on the ground, the scarred and experienced thug or pirate looking decidedly more nervous than she probably had in a while. With a flourish, Nek'Var pulls the gag from the woman's tusked mouth.

""It's not my fault! She went crazy!"" The woman immediately says, her tone a bit higher in pitch than Jerry expected. ""We were just supposed to observe, get information, but Kren lost her shit and said the boss would reward us if we solved the problem now! I don't even know where she got the Barrage!""

Jerry considers the cast of the woman's features... and notices a glimmer of blood on her cheek and neck. Part of her ear had been torn off during the fighting. Another one of the Hag's earrings perhaps?

""What does the Hag want?""

Jerry takes the chance that someone besides the Hag sent these girls and is rewarded by the Horchka's eyes widening.

""Y-You knew? Fuck. We must have been made! Damn it, I told Kren that earning some extra creds was a stupid idea when we're on a special job. Look, I don't know what the Hag wants with you, we were just supposed to watch you and report back. Then head back to base after you left.""

They hadn’t in fact been made yet, though the drug dealing had raised their profile, but Jerry didn’t bother correcting the pirate.

""I see. Where's your ship?""

""In a little valley near here.""

Jerry looks over at Dar'Vok.

""Get a team down there from orbit. Have them coordinate with Cannid Solutions... As for you...""

His eyes focus on the Horchka's looking deep into her eyes until she flinches away, no longer able to meet his gaze.

""We'll see what the Judge says about you. I hear Lady Bazalash's justice is swift and ruthless... but fair. Her envoy will know what to do with you.""

Fear starts to well in the Horchka's eyes as he reveals who her fate is in the hands of, and he uses the distraction to reach out and hit her with an axiom nerve pinch, rendering the pirate thug unconscious.

Jerry stands slowly, and returns his rifle to its axiom pocket, looking around at the group of women around him. It was a lonely sensation for a moment. With little Makena safely away, he was the only man for miles at least, hundreds of miles possibly, unless there was a brothel hidden around here somewhere. He didn't mind the company of women, not in the slightest, but every now and then he felt a taste of the isolation the average galactic man must feel... and he felt for his brothers.

Anger slowly wells up and washes away the icy pang of isolation as he gets back to the task at hand.

""Alright. We still have work to do. Search and rescue. We need to make sure everyone's okay.""

Shalkas raises a hand.

""Everyone was at the feast. Shouldn't be any dead or injured from the explosions.""

""We're going to check anyway. Then pay restitution to whoever's home this was. Then we'll withdraw.""

For once, no one had anything to say.

They (Don’t) Care About Us,runescape,1i3qzo3,2025-01-17 16:17:13,14,0.82,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i3qzo3/they_dont_care_about_us/,Much-Disk1653,Discussion,"In my post yesterday about the subscription increase and other points, I mentioned some improvements Jagex could make to RuneScape before attempting to charge absurd prices from the community. Today, Jagex’s CEO (Mod Pips) made a post apologizing and said that it was all just exploratory research. He emphasized several times that they are listening to the community… So, if they really are listening, I’m going to take this opportunity to elaborate on the points I raised yesterday (you can check them out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i33h09/the\_death\_of\_runescape/](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i33h09/the_death_of_runescape/) ).

1st: Ads in subscriptions

This tactic used by streaming companies (Netflix, Max, etc.) is abusive and should not exist in a paid service. We’re already paying for the content (and paying a lot), so it doesn’t make sense to have to watch ads as well. If there were an option to watch for free, I might understand the presence of ads, but that’s not the case! As much as I don’t support ads, I understand why they exist in free content. If they implemented this in RuneScape’s Free-to-Play version, it wouldn’t be as bad (although still not good), since it’s a free version. But putting ads in subscription plans is way too much! WE’RE ALREADY PAYING TO PLAY, WE’RE ALREADY SUPPORTING THE COMPANY WITH OUR SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND YOU STILL WANT TO ADD ADS???

2nd: Subscription prices

To enjoy all the game content, we need to be members, which means paying a subscription! In countries in Europe and the United States, where the currency is strong, and purchasing power is higher, the impact of the increase might be smaller. But in countries like Brazil (where I live), our currency is devalued due to corrupt governments, and a $350 subscription would cost over R$2,000! To put it into perspective, a Brazilian would need to work 45 days (9 hours a day) earning minimum wage just to pay for the subscription… This is absurd! Even with the BoaCompra system, which adjusts prices to our reality, the cost is already way too high (R$245 per year currently), and with the increase, it would become unmanageable.

3rd: Dedicated servers

Here in Brazil, we’ve always suffered from high ping. Since we don’t have dedicated servers, the ping stays between 125ms and 150ms, which causes a lot of problems. This makes it almost impossible to fight bosses like Vorago, Solak, Raksha, Nex, Telos, and Croesus, as these fights require quick reflexes and precision. Jagex needs to create dedicated servers in the countries where the game is supported. It’s not enough to just translate the game into the local language; it also needs to run well so we can enjoy the content as it was designed.

4th: Quality content

As a live-service game, RuneScape needs to release content consistently to keep players active and paying subscriptions or buying cosmetics. But for this to work, the content needs to be high quality, like the releases of the Necromancy, Archaeology, and Invention skills… the updates to older skills like Woodcutting, Fletching, and Mining… and new quests…

There are other important points that also deserve attention, such as the bot problem, bug fixes, the in-game economy, among others. But I’ll leave it to you to point out what else is bothering you and needs improvement. Take advantage of this moment to speak up because it seems like they are listening to the community this time… 😂😂😂

Texto em Português:

Na minha postagem de ontem sobre o aumento das assinaturas e outros pontos, comentei algumas melhorias que a Jagex poderia fazer no RuneScape antes de tentar cobrar preços absurdos da comunidade. Hoje, o CEO da Jagex (Mod Pips) fez uma postagem pedindo desculpas e disse que tudo não passava de uma pesquisa exploratória. Ele repetiu várias vezes que está ouvindo a comunidade... Então, se eles realmente estão ouvindo, vou aproveitar para detalhar melhor os pontos que já levantei ontem (você pode conferir aqui: [https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i33h09/the\_death\_of\_runescape/](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i33h09/the_death_of_runescape/) ).

1°: Anúncios em assinaturas

Essa tática usada por empresas de streaming (Netflix, Max, etc.) é abusiva e não deveria existir em um serviço pago. A gente já paga pelo conteúdo (e paga caro), então não faz sentido ter que assistir anúncios também. Se houvesse uma opção para assistir de graça, até entenderia a presença de anúncios, mas não é o caso! Por mais que EU não apoie anúncios, entendo o motivo de existirem em conteúdos gratuitos. Se implementarem isso no Free-to-Play do RuneScape, não seria tão ruim (apesar de não ser bom também), já que se trata de uma versão grátis. Mas colocar anúncios nos planos de assinatura é sacanagem demais! JÁ ESTAMOS PAGANDO PARA JOGAR, JÁ AJUDAMOS A EMPRESA COM NOSSA ASSINATURA, E AINDA QUEREM ENFIAR ANÚNCIOS???

2°: Preço das assinaturas

Pra aproveitar todo o conteúdo do jogo, a gente precisa ser membro, ou seja, pagar assinatura! Em países da Europa e nos Estados Unidos, onde a moeda é forte e o poder de compra é maior, o impacto do aumento pode até ser menor. Mas, em países como o Brasil (onde moro), nossa moeda está desvalorizada por conta de governos corruptos, e uma assinatura de 350 dólares custaria mais de 2 mil reais! Pra ter ideia, o brasileiro precisaria trabalhar 45 dias (9 horas por dia), recebendo salário mínimo, só pra pagar a assinatura... Isso é um absurdo! Mesmo com o sistema do BoaCompra, que ajusta os preços pra nossa realidade, o valor já é alto demais (245 reais por ano atualmente), e, com o aumento, ficaria inviável.

3°: Servidores dedicados

Aqui no Brasil, sofremos com ping alto desde sempre. Como não temos servidores dedicados, o ping fica na faixa de 125ms a 150ms, o que atrapalha muito. Isso torna quase impossível enfrentar chefes como Vorago, Solak, Raksha, Nex, Telos e Croesus, já que esses combates exigem reflexos rápidos e precisão. A Jagex precisa criar servidores dedicados nos países que têm suporte ao jogo. Não adianta só traduzir o jogo para o idioma local; ele também precisa funcionar bem, pra gente conseguir aproveitar os conteúdos como foram projetados.

4°: Conteúdos de qualidade

Sendo um jogo live service, o RuneScape precisa lançar conteúdo constantemente pra manter os jogadores ativos e pagando assinaturas ou comprando cosméticos. Mas, pra isso dar certo, o conteúdo precisa ser de qualidade como os lançamentos das habilidades de Necromancia, Arqueologia e Invenção... e a atualização das habilidades antigas como corte de lenha, arco e flecha, mineração... e também novas missões... 



Existem outros pontos importantes que também merecem atenção, como o problema dos bots, correção de bugs, a economia dentro do jogo, entre outros. Mas vou deixar que vocês apontem o que mais está incomodando e precisa de melhorias. Aproveitem pra falar, porque parece que eles estão ouvindo a comunidade dessa vez... 😂😂😂

"Iubitul meu vrea sa ne despartim, ca el crede ca as fi mai fericita fara el",WomenRO,1i3f5cf,2025-01-17 07:21:52,58,0.88,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenRO/comments/1i3f5cf/iubitul_meu_vrea_sa_ne_despartim_ca_el_crede_ca/,Icy_Rock4389,F4A advice,"Throwaway account, pentru ca pe cel principal sunt destul de activa.

Saptamana asta iubitul meu (eu 34F, el 34M) m-a intrebat asa, oarecum din senin, daca nu ar fi mai bine sa ne despartim. Asta dupa 3 ani de relatie si 1 jumate de locuit impreuna. Ca eu par mereu trista si simte ca din cauza lui, ca nu face destule pentru mine si pentru relatie si in acelasi timp se simte foarte stresat/presat ca nu face destule si ar trebui. Si ca el ma iubeste foarte mult si ca vrea sa faca el ce eu nu am curaj sa fac, ca sa pot fi pe viitor mai fericita. Wtf?

Tin sa mentionez ca da, am avut o perioada in care am fost mai trista, mai apatica, mai fara chef de facut lucruri, dar nu din cauza lui. Am avut ceva stres major la job, ceva probleme de sanatate cu cineva din familie la care s-a adaugat si lipsa de motivatie de a iesi pe afara/a face chestii din cauza frigului si a faptului ca la ora 5 e intuneric.

Eu nu sunt o persoana clingy sa vreau non-stop sa fac ceva cu partenerul sau sa il cicalesc. Are timp destul de ale lui (jocuri video, mesterit la masini), iar eu imi vad de ale mele. In afara ca vreau sa facem ceva in weekend sau unele seri (film, iesit in oras pt diverse activitati, board games, gatit impreuna) si 2 vacante pe an, nu il ""presez"" cu nimic. Plus ca astea mi se par lucruri normale intr-o relatie, nu mi se pare ca cer prea mult.

I-am zis ca e asa out of nowhere, ca stiu ca am avut niste stari mai nasoale, dar ca tin de mine si o sa incerc sa mi le rezolv eu, singura, pentru mine. Apoi a zis ca poate ne-ar prinde bine o pauza, sa ne gandim daca chiar suntem fericiti impreuna. Eu i-am zis ca eu nu cred ca in pauze, dar ca vreau sa discutam mai mult si sa vedem ce putem imbunatati.

Acum el se comporta ca si inainte (vorbeste cu mine ca inainte, facem treburi prin casa impreuna), insa imi refuza intimitatea si sexul, pentru ca nu vrea sa ma induca in eroare cat se gandeste. Sa nu cred ca ""ne-am impacat"".

Eu simt ca am intrat acum intr-un cerc vicios. Vreau sa ies din starea asta, incerc sa fac lucruri pozitive, dar in acelasi timp is suparata din cauza situatiei. Nu pot sa stau asa langa un om pe care il iubesc, cu care aveam planuri de viitor si sa astept sa se gandeasca, timp in care eu sa ma comport normal. Dar nici nu vreau sa arunc la gunoi o relatie buna si tot ce tine de ea fara sa incerc sa fac ceva.

As pleca vreo saptamana-doua undeva sa ii dau spatiu (pentru ca stam in apartamentul lui), dar nu prea am optiuni la prieteni/familie. Singura optiune ar fi sa inchiriez un airbnb, dar e cam scump. Am si eu un apartament cumparat/rezervat, dar nu va fi finalizat pana la sfarsitului anului.

Sorry for the long post, dar s-au adunat detaliile. Voi ce ati face in locul meu?"
"A Seat at the Council Table By K'thaal, Diplomat of the Vrexath Dominion",HFY,1i2n277,2025-01-16 06:41:01,380,0.99,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i2n277/a_seat_at_the_council_table_by_kthaal_diplomat_of/,Shadeskira,OC,"

When humanity arrived at the Interstellar Council, the entire chamber fell silent. It was not often that a new species joined our ranks, let alone one so… unassuming. Their ships lacked the imposing spires of the Xhal’therak or the shimmering shields of the Keldar Collective. Their diplomats were not flanked by ceremonial guards or towering banners. Instead, they brought something far more intriguing: a stack of contracts.

I remember observing their chief envoy—Ambassador Yates—standing at the center of the Council floor. His manner was relaxed, his words measured. He spoke not of military might or technological supremacy but of cooperation and mutual benefit. He introduced the ""Headhunter Corp,"" a peculiar organization that specialized in connecting human corporations to the needs of the galaxy.

At first, their offerings seemed modest. A mining operation on the volcanic moon of Xiltra needed workers impervious to extreme heat? Humans sent a crew. The Nok’Var Syndicate sought to rid their colony of the deadly insectoid Y’task swarms? Humans dispatched exterminators equipped with ingenious flamethrowers and battle suits. Even the Vrexath Dominion, known for our stoic independence, contracted humans to map the treacherous nebula of K’dar’s Reach.

What set them apart was their flexibility. Each human corporation specialized in a niche. Paramilitary forces handled border skirmishes. Terraforming crews breathed new life into barren worlds. Logistical teams streamlined trade routes. Over time, the Council grew dependent on these services. For all our advancements, no one could deny the humans' uncanny ability to adapt, organize, and deliver results.

It began slowly, a few contracts here and there. But within a decade, humans became indispensable. I observed firsthand how the Headhunter Corp subtly wove itself into the fabric of interstellar society. Economies thrived, conflicts were managed, and stagnation gave way to innovation. The humans had not come to conquer—they had come to sell solutions. And we bought them eagerly.

Then, the N'tharok Empire declared war on humanity.

The N’tharok were a predatory species, infamous for their relentless expansion and disdain for diplomacy. When the declaration reached the Council chambers, I expected humanity to react with desperation or pleas for aid. Instead, Ambassador Yates calmly addressed the Council.

""In accordance with our contracts,"" he began, ""all agreements will be suspended during a time of war, as stipulated in Clause 17, Subsection C."" His words sent ripples of unease through the chamber. ""For those wishing to maintain their agreements, humanity offers one path: formal alliance in our defense.""

The uproar was immediate. Delegates shouted, protested, and argued. But the reality was stark. Without humanity’s services, critical operations ground to a halt. The Keldar's terraforming projects stalled, leaving colonists stranded on barely habitable worlds. The Xhal'therak's military campaigns faltered without logistical support. Even the Vrexath Dominion faced delays in our deep-space exploration.

The fine print was genius—insidious, some called it. Humanity had bound us with dependency, not chains. And now, the Council had no choice but to act.

It was not an easy decision for the Council to intervene on humanity's behalf. Many resented their manipulation, but even more feared the consequences of inaction. One by one, the Council races pledged ships, resources, and soldiers to humanity’s defense. For the first time in history, the Interstellar Council stood united in war.

The campaign against the N'tharok was brutal but swift. Humanity’s paramilitary forces, bolstered by the combined strength of the Council’s fleets, repelled the invaders with precision and ferocity. It was during those battles that we saw another side of the humans—tenacious, inventive, and unwavering in the face of adversity.

When the war ended, humanity emerged not as conquerors but as equal partners. The fine print of their contracts, once a source of contention, became a symbol of their foresight. They had not coerced us through force but had skillfully positioned themselves as indispensable. And when their ""Hour of Need"" came, we had little choice but to stand with them.

Looking back, I cannot help but admire their strategy. Humanity did not come to the stars with weapons but with contracts. They wielded not armies but opportunity. And in doing so, they reshaped the very foundation of the Interstellar Council.

We may grumble about their methods, but there is no denying this: the humans taught us the true power of diplomacy. And for that, the galaxy will never be the same."

"Help Me Build a Frankenstein Hybrid AI Setup for LLMs, Big Data, and Mobile App Testing",LocalLLM,1i03024,2025-01-12 20:46:23,7,0.89,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1i03024/help_me_build_a_frankenstein_hybrid_ai_setup_for/,cloudcircuitry,Project,"I’m building what can only be described as a Frankenstein hybrid AI setup, cobbled together from the random assortment of hardware I have lying around. The goal? To create a system that can handle LLM development, manage massive datasets, and deploy AI models to smartphone apps for end-user testing—all while surviving the chaos of mismatched operating systems and hardware quirks. I could really use some guidance before this monster collapses under its own complexity.

**What I Need Help With**

1. **Hardware Roles**: How do I assign tasks to my hodgepodge of devices? Should I use them all or cannibalize/retire some of the weaker links?
2. **Remote Access**: What’s the best way to set up secure access to this system so I can manage it while traveling (and pretend I have my life together)?
3. **Mobile App Integration**: How do I make this AI monster serve real-time predictions to multiple smartphone apps without losing its head (or mine)?
4. **OS Chaos**: Is it even possible to make Windows, macOS, Linux, and JetPack coexist peacefully in this Frankensteinian monstrosity, or should I consolidate?
5. **Data Handling**: What’s the best way to manage and optimize training and inference for a **massive dataset** that includes web-scraped data, photo image vectors, and LiDAR cloud point data?

**The Hardware I'm Working With**

1. [**Dell XPS 15 (i7, RTX 3050 Ti)**](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-xps-15-6-oled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-ti-1tb-solid-state-drive-arctic-white/6468148.p?skuId=6468148): The brains of the operation—or so I hope. Perfect for GPU-heavy tasks like training.
2. [**ThinkPad P53 (i7, Quadro T2000):**](https://www.thepcwholesale.com/product/lenovo-thinkpad-p53-workstation-core-i7-9850h-2-6ghz-512gb-ssd-16gb-15-6-1920x1080-bt-win10-pro-webcam-nvidia-quadro-t2000-4096mb-black-backlit-keyboard-fp-reader-2/?srsltid=AfmBOopW49brnKrGtwKxZcQOtCVqVah4lbmw6_zM-7-hhOOwcXlK7VmU) Another solid workhorse. Likely the Igor to my Dell’s Dr. Frankenstein.
3. [**MacBook Air (M2)**](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-m2/): Lightweight, efficient, and here to laugh at the other machines while doing mobile dev/testing.
4. [**2x Mac Minis (Late 2014)**](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP710?locale=en_US): Two aging sidekicks that might become my storage minions—or not.
5. [**HP Compaq 4000 Pro Tower (Core 2 Duo)**](https://www.amazon.com/Hp-Compaq-4000-Pro-Business/dp/B00881K5A8): The ancient relic. It might find redemption in logging/monitoring—or quietly retire to the junk drawer.
6. [**NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin (64GB)**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-agx-orin/): The supercharged mutant offspring here to do all the real-time inferencing heavy lifting.

**What I’m Trying to Build**

I want to create a hybrid AI system that:

1. **Centralized Server with Remote Access**: One main hub at home to orchestrate all this madness, with secure remote access so I can run things while traveling.
2. **Real-Time Insights**: Process predictive analytics, geolocation heatmaps, and send real-time notifications—because why not aim high?
3. **Mobile App Integration**: Serve APIs for smartphone apps that need real-time AI predictions (and, fingers crossed, don’t crash).
4. **Big Data Handling**: Train the LLM on a mix of open data and my own data platform, which includes web-scraped datasets, photo image vectors, and LiDAR cloud point data. This setup needs to enable efficient inference even with the large datasets involved.
5. **Maximize Hardware Use**: Put these misfits to work, but keep it manageable enough that I don’t cry when something inevitably breaks.
6. **Environmental Impact**: Rely on edge AI (Jetson Orin) to reduce my energy bill—and my dependence on the cloud for storage and compute.

**Current Plan**

1. **Primary Server**: Dell XPS or ThinkPad P53 to host workloads (thinking Proxmox or Docker for management).
2. **Storage**: Mac Minis running OpenMediaVault as my storage minions to handle massive datasets.
3. **Edge AI Node**: Jetson Orin for real-time processing and low-latency tasks, especially for inferencing.
4. **Mobile Development**: MacBook Air for testing on the go.
5. **Repurpose Older Hardware**: Use the HP Compaq for logging/monitoring—or as a doorstop.

**Challenges I’m Facing**

1. **Hardware Roles**: How do I divide tasks among these devices without ending up with a system that’s all bolts and no brain?
2. **OS Diversity**: Can Windows, macOS, Linux, and JetPack coexist peacefully, or am I dreaming?
3. **Remote Access**: What’s the best way to enable secure access without leaving the lab doors wide open?
4. **Mobile Apps**: How do I make this system reliable enough to serve real-time APIs for multiple smartphone apps?
5. **Big Data Training and Inference**: How do I handle massive datasets like web-scraped data, LiDAR point clouds, and photo vectors efficiently across this setup?

**Help Needed**

If you’ve got experience with hybrid setups, please help me figure out:

1. How to assign hardware roles without over-complicating things (or myself).
2. The best way to set up secure remote access for me and my team.
3. Whether I should try to make all these operating systems play nice—or declare peace and consolidate.
4. How to handle training and inference on massive datasets while keeping the system manageable.
5. How to structure APIs and workflows for mobile app integration that doesn’t make the monster fall apart.

**What I’m Considering**

* **Proxmox**: For managing virtual machines and workloads across devices.
* **OpenMediaVault (OMV)**: To turn my Mac Minis into storage minions.
* **Docker/Kubernetes**: For containerized workloads and serving APIs to apps.
* **Tailscale/WireGuard**: For secure, mobile-friendly VPN access.
* **Hybrid Cloud**: Planning to offload bigger tasks to Azure or AWS when this monster gets too big for its britches.

This is my first time attempting something this wild, so I’d love any advice you can share before this Frankenstein creation bolts for the hills! 

Thanks in advance!"

heart-aches, heart-aches, my loving you was only heart-aches, your kiss was such a sacred thing to me, i can't believe it's just a burn-ing mem-or-y heart aches, heart-aches,

what does it matter how my heart breaks, i should be happy with someone new. but my heart aches for you!

A2-3:32

say that everything is still okay that's all i wanna know, and what they'll say. say it isn't sol

A3-7:02

i can be happy, i can be sad! i can be good, i can be bad! it all depends on you

A4-10:38

moon-light and shad-ows, and you in my arms.

and the melody in the bam-boo tree my sweeet even in shadows, i feel now alarm.

as you hold me tight in the jungle night my sweeet close to my heart, you will always be. never, never, never! to part from me

moon-light and shadows, and you in my arms

A5-13:36

The world will know! Here i go! I'm al•a•bamy bound.

A6-15:38

Every dream with you I'll sway, dear To the waltz you saved for me

Every dream when I'm away, dear I'll hear this melody Whisper goodbye and gently say, dear

That in all the days to be You will sometimes remember

This waltz you saved for me

B1-20:12

it looks like rain in cherry blossom lane

the sunshine on your smiles no longer there

B2-23:44

they looked so out of place, without your pretty face in a little second hand store

B3-26:31

do you remember? water lilies in the moonlight a silver stream where we would dream the hour through

do you remember? water lilies in the moonlight we closed our eyes and saw a paradise for two

B4-30:02

willow weep for me, willow weep for me, bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea listen to my plead, listen willow and weep for me

B5-34:06

smoke from a chimney means a log on the fire and a log on a fire means love love means that you'll be in my arms at twilight and that's what I'm dreaming of it's been so lonely to live with such a memory if you could only forgive, and once more let me see smoke from a chimney and a log on the fire and you there waiting for me

B6-38:42

a room with a view, I've got a room with a view of wonderful you, my next door dream

you're the one and only one my heart really adores and I'm so glad my window is just opposite yours

stage 2

C1-41:55

Once in the dear, dead days beyond re-call

when on the world, the mists be-gan to fall out of the dreams, that rose in a happy throng low to our hearts, love sang an old sweet song. and in the dusk, where fire-light gleam, soft-ly it wove it self in to our dream

just a song at twi-light,

when the lights are low. and the flick-ering shadows,

soft-ly come and go. through the heart be weary, sad the day and long. still to us at twi-light, comes love's old song,

comes love's old sweet song.

Even to-day, we hear love's song of yore.

deep in our hearts, it dwells for ever more. foot-steps may fal-ter, wear y grows in our way, still we can hear it at the close of day. still till the end, when life's dim sha-dows fall, Love will be found the sweetest song of all.

just a song at twi-light,

when the lights are low. and the flickering shadows,

soft-ly come and go.

through the heart and wear-y,

sad the day and long.

still to us at twi-light

comes love's old song, comes love's old sweet song.

C2-46:01

cradle me where south-ern skies

can watch me with a million eyes

sing me to sleep

lull-a-by of the leaves cover me with heaven's blue and let me dream a dream or two a pine melody cares sing the shore, fam-i-liar to me I've heard it be fore Oo-oh Oooh Oo-oh!

While my pretty one, sleeps.

D2-1:07:15

to have, to hold, to live, just a for a mo-ment

in ecstasy, and then to be, for gott-en.

to laugh, at life, and learn, to sing a love song

a mel-o-dy, that's soon to be, for gott-en.

when, love has ended, to cry, but when, your heart, is mend ed, to love, a-gain.

a night, of bliss, but when the dawn is break-ing.

a mem-ory, that's soon to be, for gott-en. love is a flower that blooms in may, fresh for a mo-ment, then fades away.

love is a vowel, that spring-time hums, to be for gott-en, when winter comes.

D3-1:10:54

in to my heart, Queri-da.

you came un-know-ing

in-to my heart, Queri-da.

with love light glow-ing

you came to me with love

D4-1:15:07

i am just a shadow, you are all the light
you are like the sun-rise, i am just the night

E6-1:37:53

Sometimes I wonder how I spend
The lonely night
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song
Besides the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
A memory of love's refrain

E7-1:40:03

when all the pretty little birds are sing-ing, and in
the evening by the deep moon-light. of all the pretty little songs and mus-ic, its the beauty of our heart enth-rall.

E8-1:42:05

i know why I've waited,

i know why I've been blue,

i wait each night for some-one, exactly like you. why should we spend money? on a show or two?
no one does those love scenes, exactly like you. you make me feel so grand, i want to hand the world

to you.

you seem to under-stand, each fool-ish little scheme I'm schem-ing, dream I'm dream-ing.

now i know why mother, taught me to be true. she ment me for some-one, exactly like you

F1-1:45:25

poetic words set to love-notes of birds sweet-ly blend-ing,

fall from your tongue and they're sung to glorious end-ing

F2-1:47:00

crad-le me where south-ern skies can watch me with a mill-ion eyes, sing me to sleep. lulla-by of the leaves.

cover me with heaven's blue, and let me dream a dream or two,
sing me to sleep. lullaby of the leaves.

2 App measures nothing happens or sometimes a semblance of a blurred background

Everything else works perfectly 

I put the phone in diagnostic mode, LiDAR is ok

Abusing HRE mechanics for fun and profit,eu4,1hv7sfb,2025-01-06 14:43:38,8,0.9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/1hv7sfb/abusing_hre_mechanics_for_fun_and_profit/,akaioi,Discussion,"So I'm in a truly blessed Austria run (got early PU on Bohemia, Burgundy, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania; broke up France to make new princes; etc) and was able to revoke the privilegia \~1575 or so.  So I have 77 vassals eagerly baying for blood and it occurred to me...  **it would be wrong NOT to exploit this**.  I thought I'd share some thoughts on how, and how I got there!

**Part 1:  Illegal Territory**

Until way deep into the Imperial Reforms, the HRE guys will fight and annex one another.  Fair enough, right?  Here's the thing though...  you want to maximize the number of HRE princes in preparation for the revocation.  So, you'll want to make extensive use of the ""demand unlawful territory"" button.  But note:

* There's a modifier ""recently demanded unlawful territory"", so you can't demand twice in quick succession against the same guy.  Hence only demand territory whose release will create a new prince.  A prince taking one province away from a several-province rival can be ignored. 

**Part 2:  Hans und France**

It is imperative to break France as early as possible.  Load up on allies and fight them, and force them to release as many independent nations as possible.  Ally as many as you can (don't worry about your poor suffering Dip points), and vassalize them.  This is the only way I've found to make the ""Invite to Empire"" feature work; only on happy vassals.

Then discard the smaller of the old allies, and prepare ""Expand Empire"" wars against the French minors you didn't vassalize.

The end goal is to ""nudge"" France itself into the Empire!

Note also, it's best to delay the revocation until you've chopped up France.  More princes, right?

**Part 3:  All the Moneys**

All those forgettable German trade nodes ultimately dump into one of the end nodes.  After revocation, let's collect in all three, and look in those nodes; lots of your princes have trade power there.  So...  let's have all those princes cede trade power to us, and we'll be rolling in ducats!  They're too small to get feisty about it, post-Revocation.

**Part 4:  The Dar al-Kathulikiati**

Otto was doing well, so fought a war against him to take 1 Syrian province.  Then fought war against a formerly-large AQ, vassalized them.  Now, both my vassals have lots of cores against Otto.  So...

* Declare war against Otto
* Sit back and relax as the HRE roflstomps them
* The day before the peace deal:  force-convert AQ and Syria to Catholic
* In the peace deal
   * Return all Syrian and AQ cores; *this counteracts the grouchiness about being converted*
   * Take 1 Mamluk-core province for myself
* After my vassals have done all the converting, I will annex them.  I notice Persia has some hidden vassals I can mine as well...

**Part 5:  The Chronicles of Prydain**

The one nation in Europe that has a chance against a (semi) united HRE is Great Britain; the vassal swarm is weak at invading overseas.  Here's what I did...

* Allow Britain to keep provinces on the mainland (if they'd already lost them, I'd sell or give them some!)  I need an easy way to get war score on them.
* Fight Britain until they are willing to release Cornwall; it's cheap in warscore!
* Do anything you can -- break truces if you must -- to conquer or vassalize Cornwall before GB can
* After a few years of chill, wait for GB to declare war on someone else, preferably someone far away
* Move a gigantic army to Cornwall, then declare war.  The all-powerful Home Fleet is now irrelevant!

**Part 6:  Do not Renew the Imperium**

The privilege-revoked HRE is too much fun.  It's much better (to my mind) than the boring reborn empire.  Sure the border-gore of a successful HRE will be awful; just look at the Player map-mode and you'll feel better.  ;D"

Nu e cine stie ce profit, sa zicem ca o fi in jur de 15k€ pe an, si am bonurile de la cryptoatm-urile unde am vandut pentru fiat, dar problema e ca nu stiu exact cat e de platit :/ Normal platesti 10% impozit+CASS pe profit, dar la mine situatia e mai complicata :))

Nu am folosit niciun cex gen binance, kraken, coinbase asa ca n-am csv-uri d-alea centralizate, toate tranzactiile sunt facute pe tokenuri defi marunte, de pe o gramada de walleturi (la unele din ele nici nu mai stiu adresele si ce am facut cu ele), si nici nu am scos tot in fiat. Am bonurile care arata cat am scos in lei tho, si bonurile care arata cat am cumparat, but wait, ca e si mai complicat:

Exemplu simplu: intri cu 10k€, faci trade pe 100 tokens intre ele, ajungi sa ai 20k€ worth of tokens, scoti 10k€ in fiat, si atunci platesti 10% impozit+CASS pe diferenta intre 50% din cat ai intrat (adica 5k) si aia 10k scosi. Easy right?

Exemplul meu: intru cu 10k€, fac trade intre 100-200 tokenuri intre ele, ajung sa am intre 30-50k sa zicem, care fluctueaza zilnic foarte mult, si scot random cate 1-1.5k€ pe luna, in 3-5 tranzactii, fara sa stiu exact cat mi-a mai ramas pe celelalte walleturi cand am scos, deci fara sa am cum sa calculez ca la data x cand am scos suma y am de platit impozitul z pe diferenta intre x% si y%. Si nu, nici macar un contabil n-ar fi capabil sa descalceasca ce am facut eu p-acolo si cat costa nush ce token in nush ce zi, la nush ce ora cand am scos eu. Am experienta in blockchain analysis si tot mi-ar fi imposibil sa-mi dau seama ce si cum, daramite un contabil... Deci tot ce stiu e ca am intrat initial cu o suma (am proof), am vandut treptat in urmatorii ani (am proof), si mi-a tot ramas mereu un rest in random tokens care putea fi intre 10-100k (habar n-am cat mai ramanea)

Are ceva daca platesc 10%+CASS pe toata diferenta intre cat am bagat si cat am scos? Si cum calculez pentru anii urmatori? Pentru ca tot din suma aia initiala o sa trebuiasca sa calculez, ca n-am mai bagat niciodata la loc, doar am scos. Adica din vreo 10k bagati initial, sa zicem ca am scos treptat vreo 12-15k in 2022, si mi-a mai ramas ceva, vreo 6-8k I guess, dupa am mai facut ceva profit cu aia, si am mai scos vreo 15k la fel prin 2023, mi-a mai ramas iar vreo 10-30k, dupa am mai facut ceva profit si am mai scos iar vreo 15-20k prin 2024. Calculez in fiecare an 10%+CASS pe diferenta dintre aia 10k bagati initial si ce am scos, plus ceva penalitati? Nu prea imi pasa cat e de platit, vreau numai sa n-am probleme si sa nu ma futa anafu"

So hua yeh kiii ye Relationship tha breakup ki kagar pe.

To hum sab jate h apne free ke therapist ke pas matlab bestfriend. So i stopped using snapchat and I asked Tinku to maintain my streaks (ye to bahot impotent thi us time pe). My bestfriend was sending snaps to everyone. he had my account and after 2 years he told me that I read your chats with boyfriend (ex girgit). I asked him why so he said ki yrr dekhna to pdta h naa ki dono ke bich me chal kya rha haiii but i was like dude I trusted you and you did this without my permission.i shared every single secrets of mine with him. And he was telling me yrr its ok if u did Makeout with him to itna dar mat breakup kr le i was like ye kab pata chala ye kiya vo kiya and all to fir i get to know ki bhai chat save thi but the important thing is i trusted him and we were bestfriends like for 3 years So this was unexpected from him.

Am luat decizia in final de a ma desparti de iubitul meu, relatie de 7 ani... Maine isi va impacheta toate lucrurile si va pleca. Doare foarte rau dar cred ca e decizia cea buna, consider ca am oferit mai mult decat trebuia iar el era fericit dar eu nu pentru ca nu imi ofera deloc aceeasi cantitate de efort pe care i-o ofeream eu... it sucks, dar cred ca e mai ok acum decat mai tarziu.... Sper sa reusesc de data asta sa duc la bun sfarsit aceasta decizie, am luat-o de mai multe ori dar somehow, m-a sucit de cap ca il tot iertam si ajungeam in acelasi punct.. Doar acum realizez de fapt cat de mult m-a schimbat si cat de mult nu ma mai recunosc pe mine... cumva, mereu ma gaslightuita sa cred ca e vina mea si ca eu sunt nebuna, s a jucat cu gandurile mele incredibil de tare.. De ce am stat? I was fucking brainwashed si of course il iubeam.. Ceva tips and tricks cum sa trec mai usor prin perioada asta? Apreciez si multumesc! "
Cum e viața mea de câteva luni.. ,WomenRO,1hra4gb,2025-01-01 14:18:46,16,0.75,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenRO/comments/1hra4gb/cum_e_viața_mea_de_câteva_luni/,clauuubauu,Rant - No advice,"Cred ca aceasta ""cadere""  a mea a început din noiembrie, eu si soțul meu ne certam des, după am avut și câteva discuții și certuri cu soacra mea si cu sora ei. 

Am vrut să plec, eram convinsă ca se va întâmpla asta. Am avut o perioadă în care tip am, tremuram și  nu voiam să mai vad pe nimeni. Eram de necontrolat. Se iscase o discuție groaznică, și m-am convins în sinea mea ca pentru mine  si soțul meu e finalul. 
Îmi sunasem părinții, ei erau gata să vina sa ma ia. Țin minte ca l-am văzut prima data pe soțul meu rănit atunci, mai avea un pic și plangea. M-a rugat să nu plec, ca nimeni nu-mi poate lua locul și ca nu o să poată să mai fie cu cineva vreodată. Eram bulversată, nu știam ce s-a fac. Și toate astea din cauza mamei lui  și a matusei lui. 
Eram extenuata de discuții, de certuri banale și cât de deranjată era soacra mea ca nu îi ofer atenție surorii sale. 
Dar, din nou, am stat și m-am gandit, la mine si soțul meu, la planurile noastre, voaim chiar să facem si un copil. În trecut gândul ca îmi voi întemeia o familie cu el și ca o să facem un copil era minunat. Dar acum nu mai avem planul ăsta. Lucrurile nu stau bine intre noi, cât șiintrep mine si maică sa.
Am rămas pentru el. Părinții mei au fost dezamăgiți pe moment. Dar îl iubesc. Doar eu îl cunosc și doar el ma cunoaște. Am trecut prin multe anul ăsta împreuna.
Nu știu cum dar soacra mea era conectată la telefonul meu, îmi spiona mesajele cu părinții mei. După ne-am certat din nou din cauza surorii sale. Am încetat să mai vorbesc și sora ei și le-am  spus socrilor să-mi respecte decizia. Au făcut-o pe moment. Dar după au început din nou discuții.
Ne-am certat în ajunul Crăciunului și azi, în prima zi din an. Intre mine si soacra mea nu  mai exista conexiunea de la început. Nici măcar mama ei nu mai vorbește cu mine. Perioada asta am stat izolată. Nu mai suport pe nimeni, mai ales figurile soacrei mele și bipolaritatea ei. Sunt într-o fază în care, la orice discuție plang și ma gandesc ca vreau sa plec la părinții mei.
Mi-am rugat soțul să plecăm un timp în  concediul de iarnă undeva, doar pentru ca nu mai suportam să stau în casă cu soacra mea.
Mi-a spus că nu ne permitem. Începusem să cred ca am intrat în depresie. Of atatea lucruri s-au întâmplat din noiembrie până acum. Nici nu le mai țin minte. 

Deci da, deocamdată ma lupt cu chestia cu plânsul la orice discuție, incerc să fiu mai sigură pe mine. În rest, Dumnezeu o să vadă sufletul fiecăruia și o să fie  judecat la timpul lui"

Sfârșitul de an e pentru a lăsa ceva în urmă, dar și pentru a menține ce a fost bun, sau util. Vă simțiți mulți singuri, și eu o fac, dar cât aveți acest de reflecție interioară, think about living in the moment. Bucurați-vă de momentele cu oamenii noi, de o privire, de o îmbrățișare. 

Încercați acel lucru nou, dați o șansă, fiți răbdători unde în trecut n ați fii fost, și nu lăsați răutatea să vă picteze sufletul în negru, căci e o culoare care iese greu.

Live to fight another day, or even fight to live another day. Stand ascunși, privam pe cineva bun de prezența noastră, și invers. 

Be more open. E greu și pentru mine să mă încadrez la ascultăm și nu judecăm când mai des nu ascult, dar judec. Defect uman, ce să faci. Totuși, e mai ok să fii deschis decât prea deștept, or at least thats what I think. 

Apreciați oamenii dragi din jurul vostru, gândiți mai mult în situațiile în care nervii take control, vorba dulce, mult aduce. 

În rest, aștept înjurăturile voastre cu privire la faptul ca dau sfaturi dar nu mai știu nici diferența între fii și fi.

All in all...

STRENGTH AND HONOR."

The horde was on the move.

Not that the younger Bridger children ever really stopped moving as a group. Even during nap time, there was always one member of the Bridger brood squirming or exploring or doing something. An unending torrent of perpetual motion.

It was like nothing Firi had ever experienced before despite her experience with early childcare, especially with Volpir kits, helping her mother when they still lived with their original clan. A healthy Volpir kit spent most of his or her time sleeping, only becoming more active after a few months at the earliest.

Human blooded kits certainly slept a lot, and needed more nutrients to sustain themselves but they were also significantly more active than a 'full' Volpir counterpart. Their eyes opened earlier and they'd learned to crawl faster. It was a fascinating process to watch, especially as her daughters’ personalities began to emerge.

Of her own litter, Lucina was the eldest and was very bold, easily partnering up with 'the trouble trio' from Syl's litter, James, Inara and Indra, the inseparable siblings who seemed determined to get into every bit of trouble they could. Lucina was joining them more and more often when left in common play areas.

By contrast her son Chad was quite shy still, always eager to be picked up and held and content to watch the world as he snuggled against his mother. If she was around, he wanted to be with her, and when she wasn't around, he didn't always cry, but he clearly missed her presence even as he liked his grandmother and nannies.

Just like she'd thought after he'd been born, a true mother's boy and it still made her heart weep with joy as the fair eyed little lad snuggled up against her come nap time. The rest of her litter seemed to be somewhere between Lucina and Chad, every little hint of personality from clever to thoughtful and everything else between them. Even as such small lives there was just so... much to them! It really was amazing, and not something she'd truly understood as the miracle it was till she'd become a mother herself. She'd seen the personalities in her little half siblings and siblings from Inara's later litters that she'd assisted with caring for, but she'd never seen just how fine the nuance got.

Things only got more interesting as they began letting more and more of the children fully play together. It hadn't been a conscious decision to isolate them, but there had been some internal self segregation that saw the litters mostly stay together. If it was an instinct or an axiom effect Firi wasn't sure, but the various litters or clutches always ended up back with their siblings.

Except for the trouble trio. Their growing little group was well past a trio now. They had added her own Lucina to their ranks, and Ghorza’s daughters, Ghalza and Lagertha had joined them soon after. The slightly more independent twins were easily as active as their half brother, and fell in with his little group of play room explorers. Mitrya, Nadi's eldest by birth, or by hatching rather, had also joined the play group, which added a whole new capacity to their efforts to find some sort of mess to get into.

Kohb infants learned to not only to walk, but to run shortly after hatching so they could escape and hide from predators if they managed to invade their dens back on the Kohb home world. A high energy burst of development that then settled into a fairly normal development curve. So not only could Mitrya walk up right, she could even run if she needed to, and could weave and evade with impressive coordination, something that had gotten anyone who hadn't mastered basic axiom telekinesis to seek lessons from Cascka out of pure frustration of trying to catch one adorable little Kohb or another.

Mitrya also had thumbs, though she hadn't quite mastered putting them to work, thank the goddess. She was a very clever little girl, and she seemed to feed off the energy of her half siblings to do one thing or another. They'd be true terrors in a year or three when they could all move properly and think up more complex plans like getting toys from high shelves or stealing cookies from the kitchens. Not that they didn't try to make plans now, but the limitations of true infants prevented anything too complicated beyond working together to stack blocks or something.

She gives her son a little nuzzle, kissing his brow as he continues to sleep peacefully as she rocks him. Little quiet moments like this were paradise, and all the very, very noisy moments in between these precious seconds of perfection made them all the sweeter.

Part of the horde was starting to settle down, a moment of sleepiness spreading, either by body language or perhaps a subtle signal in axiom or perhaps some older form of communication. Firi watches as the room slowly continues to shift like a great tide towards a nap en masse, leaving only James and his little band of sisters playing quietly in their favorite corner.

The door opens and Mikasa pads in, brushing by Firi's leg affectionately to announce herself as she picks out a pillow with a little knot of kits and settles down with them for nap time. She was a good girl like that, always coming in to cuddle and look after the babies whenever she wasn't with Cindy. Mikasa was a wonder with the children, never making a wrong step or movement to risk a hurt child. She was effectively a fourth nanny and the only risk that the large dog was to the babies was that one infant or another might end up getting groomed by Mikasa's broad tongue and end up in need of a bath.

It was always interesting to observe the interaction with the pets of the Bridger household with its youngest members.

Maximus the Doberman Pinscher had wanted to play with the babies, and had therefore been banned from the nursery. It wasn't his fault, he was a baby too after all, and he was just excited, but nails and fangs near infants made everyone involved nervous and Maximus didn't know how to calm himself down yet.

Espirit, Eymali's massive Savannah Cat, a lithe, beautiful and graceful predator well matched to her mistress, had inspected the nursery once and quickly made herself scarce. The noise and movement was just a bit too much for the solitary feline who appreciated her peace and quiet, but Firi suspected Espirit would prove to be a wonderful companion to Eymali's triplets when they were born in the near future.

Fenrir on the other hand tried to be a bit more dignified than Mikasa, but he regularly inspected the nursery and would occasionally let the babies play with him. He was very gentle and careful in the nursery despite his ever growing mass... which gave Firi the occasional heart attack when she saw just how big the paws on the monster her husband called a pet were getting next to one of the babies!

However, Fenrir had won her permanent approval, and indeed visiting rights when he gingerly removed one child away from a toy that had a potentially dangerous malfunction and wouldn't let anyone near it until one of the nannies came to see what in the worlds was going on.

He might be massive, but he was clearly looking out for what Firi suspected he thought of as his siblings.

Hel on the other hand seemed to share Espirit's opinion of the nursery. One on one, or with a single litter she was affectionate and very gentle, but with the whole group on the move... she tended to extract herself from the situation and make her way back to Dar'Vok's side. Not that Firi could blame her. Even a one hundred girl family wouldn't generally have this many children at once. Everyone getting pregnant more or less at once had been... a mistake... but the best kind of mistake. One of passion, enthusiasm, love and joy.

Besides, they could handle it. She could handle it.

Firi lets out a gentle sigh as she glances down at her son before walking over to a crib and settling Chad in next to most of his sisters.

""Honestly, what more in the galaxy could I ask for in life?""

Yet... there was a storm cloud in her sunny skies. She'd been having dreams recently. Bad dreams. Dreams that revolved around something bad happening in the near future. She'd never call herself a prophet, and she lacked Bari's precognitive gifts, but every now and then, she got feelings, and she had a bad feeling about their next port of call. Not this world, the world the corporation that ruled it had renamed Primus... but the world of Nar'Korek, the capital world of the Kopekin Khannate. She knew little about them save that they were just shy of swearing off technology they were so conservative, but something was haunting her heart and-

Suddenly, strong warm arms wrap around her and hoist her into the air. Familiar warm arms. Familiar axiom. Only one person in all the galaxy felt like this. Firi could find him in the dark. Find him blind, deaf and dumb. Only by scent. Only by axiom. Only by the beat of his heart. So long as she could crawl, she could make her way to Jerry. Syl and all the others could love him as they would, and she did have to share, but Jerry was the love of her life, and if she did reincarnate as some religions said she would when her time came, hopefully the love of all her lives.

""Darling!"" Firi twists and plants a passionate kiss on Jerry's lips.

The young woman Firi had been would have never been bold enough to do something like that. Would have been hard pressed to ask Jerry to hold hands.

Lucky for her, she wasn't that girl anymore, and not only could she kiss her husband with all the love her heart could provide, but she got kissed back so hard it stole her breath away.

Good thing she was already in her lover's arms, or she'd be liable to swoon like something out of the more silly Human romance novels she'd been reading recently to practice her skills with her husband's native language.

""I thought you had longer hours today.""

Jerry smiles at her and her heart races slightly.

""Mhmm. I did, but I got out of it, then went and picked up Nadi after clinic hours.""

Nadi pops up over Jerry's shoulder and gives Firi a wink before dropping back down to the deck.

""How are the children today?"" Nadi asks, looking around and quickly picking out her own sprogs.

""Oh everyone's fine. There was a little boo boo earlier, but Rezne surprised herself more than anything. Just a little pinch... but she got a bit fuzzier for a few moments. She's the paler skinned of Nezebet's twins, taking after Jerry of course, but I swear on the goddess's tail she had a near full coat of golden fur for a second or two and almost seemed to be a bit bigger! I need to talk to Nezbet and find out if it's normal for a Takra kitten to do that whole warform thing they do.""

Jerry thinks for a second.

""Pretty sure it's not. If Rezne's actually showing signs of using her warform this early it's very big news. Like. Auspicious signs of the birth of a powerful heroine right out of Takra legends.""

""Hmm. Interesting topic for dinner at least.""

Firi's large, fluffy ears dance as Jerry plants another kiss on the crown of her head.

""How's the new room working out?""

""You mean the 'hot' room? Come have a look. Want to come along Nadi?""

Nadi looks over from where she's snatching another infant Kohb with the help of a little axiom telekinesis.

""Mhmm. You can press on without me, I could use a nap before dinner actually, so I'll just take the girls back to my room for a nice big cuddle. Maybe grab Cindy if she's back from school.""

""Alright sweetheart, I'll see you after dinner."" Jerry leans down and gives Nadi a kiss then follows Firi out into the passageway.

""I'm still shocked."" She begins. ""How fast Masha's babies began to breathe fire...""

""Yeah. Masha was surprised too. Good thing we were able to get an Apuk grade nursery room set up. I hate to keep them away from their half sisters...""

""But the majority of our children aren't fireproof, nor are most of the furnishings. Well. At least it wasn't till we had Wichen put the appropriate runes on just about every surface vaguely near where the Apuk babies might be. Past that, with a little more preparation, and a chance to let them grow a bit, we'll make sure they socialize soon. Plus they aren't entirely alone, and it won't be too long before Aqi's clutch hatches and they have plenty of half siblings to join them.""

They slip through the door quietly, receiving a bow from Dros'Vet. The Apuk nannies had been extra busy since Masha's clutch hatched. Apuk children really needed a full time minder and Masha still needed to go fly, luckily with Holly joining the stay at home mom team full time they'd received some much needed reinforcements.

Dros'Vet raises her head. ""I have the suppression field over the crib on. We can hear them but they can't hear us. They can feel your axiom presence of course.""

Sure enough, a little hand from one of Masha's clutch of eight is raised in Jerry's direction before the pink little hand returns to the cuddle puddle.

""Anything to report, Dros'Vet?""

The maid's eyes snap to her boss, looking down at Firi. Jerry might be prince and admiral, Syl might be first wife, Aquilar was the princess they owed allegiance to, but Firi ruled here and the household staff knew it!

""Nothing in particular. Young miss Hippolyta has integrated with them splendidly. She's more than a bit bigger of course, but they just love group cuddles.""

The big fluffy lump that was Jaruna's daughter Hippolyta takes that moment to raise her head up, looking around sleepily before letting out a big yawn and settling back down. As one of the only other fireproof children in the family, adding her to the 'hot' nursery had been a very quick decision. As they aged, the Apuk would be a more consistent source of sparring partners for the young warrior to be as well. Firi knew Jerry tried to pretend that Hippolyta wasn't a warrior born, but with Jerry's eyes and Jaruna's intensity as only an infant, Firi figured Hippolyta Bridger would be living up to the martial aspect of her family name in no time.

""We were also very lucky that not only did Lady Masha have a son, but that said son was just shy of being as fire resistant as a full blooded Apuk was a blessing from the goddess. Dus'Bridger is quite comfortable with his clutch sisters. We've seen no signs of any issues, and his strength seems to be around where I'd expect an Apuk infant's to be. He's more active in different ways... very intellectual. And...""

Dros'Vet leans in, clearly excited.

""Ko'Shem said she saw the young master breath fire this morning after she fed him his breakfast! Not a steady flame, but it never is at this age.""

Jerry grins. ""Seems naming him after Princess Miri'Tok's sorcerous ancestor has provided appropriate inspiration.""

""Yes my lord, I would fully expect him to claim his birth right and title out of all of them so far... perhaps a battle prince one day?""

""We'll see if he wants to undergo that kind of training, but it's an excellent sign. We'll need to get Doctor McCoy in for another check up... apparently just a physical examination, light scan and bloods won't do. I suppose we thought we had decent data on Human hybrids at this point, but there's always a surprise in the works. Tell Ko'Shem and Narl'Teka that if one of you manages to record Dus'Bridger breathing flames, I'd bet money the Empress will have a reward for the video. To say nothing of the scientific implications.""

Dros'Vet curtsies.

""Of course. We'll do our best. Unfortunately Ko'Shem was walking the halls with the young master and wasn't on one of the security cameras.""

""A security dead zone?""

""Only deep in the Den during the day time when we're awake and actively on watch with most of the household at work. Shall I speak with one of the handmaidens to change it?""

Firi watches as Jerry considers it for a second, and can tell he's settling on trusting the specialists.

""No, I trust Nar'Salis and her team to handle security appropriately, and it's really Firi's domain, not mine.""

Firi taps her chin for a second.

""I'll discuss it with Nar'Salis over tea tomorrow. No need to tell her Dros'Vet, I'll message her or go find her after the evening meal.""

""Yes, m'lady.""

Firi smiles and takes Jerry's hand.

""We'll come back later after the nap. Thank you for your hard work Dros'Vet.""

""Of course, m'lady. We'll be here if you need us.""

Back in the hallway, Firi gives Jerry's hand another squeeze. Even the warmth of the 'hot' nursery couldn't tame the ice in her chest.

""Is something wrong?""

Firi shakes her head... then thinks better of it. She could tell Jerry. She had no secrets from him.

""I have a bad feeling about the Kopekin and Nar'Korek. Something's... bothering me. I'm worried.""

""Hmm.""

Jerry considers her words for a moment.

""Yeah. I think you might be right to feel that way... Diana's worried too. Until we get something more solid than vague feelings of concern though, we have to press on.""

""I know. I don't like it, but I know.""

Jerry pulls her up into his embrace again.

""I'm right here, and even if I go somewhere, I'll come home again.""

""I know that too."" She smiles, planting a kiss on the tip of his nose.

""Let's do something special together after we deal with the Kopekin.""

""Like what?""

""Whatever you want to do. Just the two of us, or with your litter. We can take a vacation if we can find a nice world. Or use the holodeck. Just have a picnic in the terrarium like we do occasionally. Whatever your heart desires, I'll grant.""

""Is it really doing something special when you try to grant what my heart desires every day?""

""...It can be if we want it to be. Just look at Human holidays, half of them are an excuse to drink in silly attire. The rest of them still involve drinking in silly attire.""

""Fair point. Would you care to join me for a little tea? Just to... relax?""

Firi does her best to give Jerry a proper sultry look.

""I do have some interesting alternative ideas for relaxing. If just tea isn’t catching your fancy.""

""Well, let's indulge in each other for a time. We should have an hour or so before dinner.""

""Are you going to let me down to walk to the master bedroom?""

""No.""

Firi leans up and kisses Jerry again with a giggle.

""Perfect.""

Dating.. Luați de citit la cafeluț 😂,LGBTRomania,1hndm0f,2024-12-27 07:13:02,26,0.91,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTRomania/comments/1hndm0f/dating_luați_de_citit_la_cafeluț/,AdvertisingAwkward23,Vent,"1st of all, sărbători fericite tuturor!

Sper ca 2024 să vă fi îmbogățit viețile cu lecții frumoase care v-au ajutat să evoluați. Și hai cu un 2025 mai bun!

Now.. About dating..

Sunt un bărbat gay, 29 (în mai puțin de o lună 30) ani, București. Ca experiență relațională, pot vorbi de două relații: una de 4 ani și ceva și una de 4 luni.

Prima relație (cea de 4 ani) a survenit în timp ce nici măcar nu eram out, undeva la 24 ani. După ce am fost sigur că partenerul meu o să fie stabil, am făcut coming out-ul către prieteni, iar primirea a fost super emoționantă și pozitivă fără excepție. Deci pe planul ăsta da, vorbesc de un privilegiu.

Această relație de 4 ani a venit după cam tot 4 ani în care efectiv eram mega confuz și chiar negam posibilitatea să fiu queer. Am experimentat lucruri non-penetrative cu 3 bărbați între 20 și 24 ani, însă n-a fost ceva foarte plăcut. Am învățat în schimb ce să NU caut la un om.

Fast forward, relația de 4 ani implodează, iar eu intru într-o nouă relație prea devreme cu un tip care s-a dovedit a fi cea mai dezolantă persoană pe care am întâlnit-o vreodată. Chiar și așa, pe cât a fost de nașpa experiența, pe atât de multe lucruri am învățat și consolidat despre mine. Pot spune că în sfârșit trăiesc autentic, încrezător în intuiția mea.

Recapitulare: 

2015-2019: experimentare cu 3 bărbați (kinda meh, kinda ew, dar am învățat lucruri semnficative despre ce-mi doresc) 

2019-2024: relația cea mai îndelungată, cea mai stabilă și cu lecțiile cele mai valoroase de până acum 

2024: relația de 4 luni, ultra intensă, ultra accelerată, full of red flags and anxiety, dar care mi-a demonstrat că sunt awake, intuiția mea e sfântă, corpul meu e cel mai loial mie și că merit mult mai mult pentru ce ofer.

Now.. În octombrie mi-am instalat Boo și Tinder curios fiind dacă și ce fel de oameni pot întâlni. Doamne ajuta, am mers la două date-uri: unul cu un tip foarte smart, cu capul pe umeri, părea serios and stuff, însă care intenționa să părăsească România în max. 1 ani. A bit disappointing când am auzit, dar asta e. Măcar a fost o întâlnire la cafea foarte plăcută. Celalalt date a fost cu un tip smart si el și cu niște experiențe de viață super interesante: călătorii jurnalistice în America Centrală, relații culturale între state, etc., dar din păcate nu am descoperit compatibilitate pe planuri de viitor.

Apoi începe rollercoasterul.. Intru în vorbă, in paralel, cu doi tipi. Aflu ulterior, de pe Insta-ul unuia dintre ei că erau foști.. Cum aflu, you might wonder? Avea poze cu fostul binemersi postate. Pentru că asta e ceva ce nu-mi oferă deloc încredere, am discutat deschis cu amândoi și le-am explicat că eu încetez dialogul cu amândoi și le mulțumesc pentru scurta discuție.

Am mai întâlnit și un bărbat trans din Bacău. Sweet guy și sper să mă văd cu el la o cafeluță când trec pe la el prin zona. Deci oameni ok mao există, dar jur ca-s mega rari.. Ce dracu

Apoi continuă aventura cu matchuri care nu scriu sau cărora dacă le scri, nu răspund niciodată. Apoi tipi care mint că sunt pe căutare de relație și 30min mai târziu cer poze cu pla sau dezbrăcat. Apoi tipi care par super ok, stabilești date cu ei și subit sunt concediați, răcesc și 11 zile nu spun nimic. Apoi tipi care vor să te folosească pentru a-și boosta ego-ul ptr că you're a catch 4 them

ȘI ACUM ÎNTREBAREA ROȘIE:

Cum dracu întâlnești bărbați gay, relationship-oriented (preferabil family-oriented), cu ceva maturitate emoțională încât să înțeleagă că o relație funcționează nu doar în inerția iubirii, ci și ca rezultat al eforturilor BILATERALE și a progresului... Atât. At this point nici măcar nu-mi pasă așa tare cum arată...

Can we make emotional maturity HOT AF?

Deci cum? Că pe dating apps pare că nu e cazul...

Also, tipii care se au la follow pe insta/facebook cu toți ceilalți de pe Tinder... **Why???**

Atât. Pwp tuturor și sărbători fără aciditate gastrică vă doresc 💪🏻"
Deadbedroom situation,WomenRO,1hmwafm,2024-12-26 14:47:15,13,0.62,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenRO/comments/1hmwafm/deadbedroom_situation/,Pretty_Dark4840,Dating & Relationship ,"Fetelor, first of all, asta e un throwaway deoarece nu doresc sa imi folosesc contul principal pentru acest post. 

Stiu ca este o problema cu care se confrunta mai mult barbatii sau cel putin ei vorbesc mai des despre asta, insa am si eu nevoie de ceva sfaturi pentru ca simt ca nu mai suport sa las lucrurile asa. As avea nevoie de pareri/sfaturi. Dau orice alte detalii la cerere, poate mai sunt persoane care trec prin ceva asemanator. 

27F, sunt impreuna cu prietenul meu 26F (doar 6 luni diferenta intre noi, are si el aproape 27 curand) de 5 ani de zile. In toți acesti 5 ani (mai nou si locuim impreuna) nu s-a atins de mine absolut deloc, a se traduce, nu am facut niciodata sex:))) nu, nada, nimic, absolut deloc.

Contextul este ca eu pana la a fi cu el am mai avut 2 relatii active din punct de vedere sexual si am acumulat ceva experienta. El nu are:))) lucru care nu m-a deranjat inital pentru ca am incercat sa facem sex, dar ceva nu era niciodata ok. Nu se simtea el ok si evident, nu am mai continuat. 

Inafara de aspectul asta, jur ca avem relatia perfecta si e omul ideal pentru mine, din toate punctele de vedere, mai putin asta:))) mai rau este ca imi spune si ca nu ar fi vina mea, doar ca nu stie ce dracu are:))). Spune ca este atras de mine, dar ca nu ii vine sa faca sex, absolut deloc. La fel nici cu masturbatul nu prea des, nici de asta nu are chef aparent.

M-am gandit la toate variantele posibile, ca nu e atras de mine (pe alta nu cred ca are ca la modul cel mai serios, am vorbit despre asta si mi-ar spune), ca o fi asexual, ca o avea impotenta (nu cred ca am vreo sansa sa il fac sa verifice chestia asta, sincera sa fiu).

Ma nelinisteste ca nici macar nu ma atinge in felul ala gen, deloc, pot sa fiu dezbracata in pat langa el si nimic si nu, credeti ma, nici la alte femei nu merge sau la porn:))) (am incercat si asta pentru ca nu suntem 100% monogami). he s esentially dead:)). Fara sa exagerez, cred ca erectia de dimineata e cel mai des motiv pentru care o are. 

E foarte de rahat situatia pentru ca, inafara de asta, e omul perfect, dar chestia asta ma distruge. Eu am un libido foarte ridicat si cred ca va puteti imagina cat de greu imi este. In fostele relatii faceam sex si zilnic sau de mai multe ori pe zi, si acum sunt in situatia asta. 

A inceput ea ma enerveze deja pentru ca isi cere scuze ca nu stie ce e cu el si ca va rezolva, dar cand?:))) Daca nu ar fi fost omul care este, jur cred ca ii dadeam papucii de mult, dar sunt dispusa sa mai incerc in cazul lui, insa e foarte greu pentru ca deja simt ca suntem mai degraba colegi de camera decat altceva. Ma simt si prost sa incerc sa imitiez eu ceva pentru ca stiu ca o sa il vad ca nu se simte comfortabil. Eu si simt nevoia sa simt afectiune fizica si o mare parte dim problema e ca pana si atunci cand ma masturbez, nu ma lasa nici macar sa-l tin de mana ca sa incerc totusi sa creez o oarecare conexiune daca o pot numi asa. Nici nu stiu daca o face intentionat sau nu, dar ma simt respinsa in momentele alea. 

Pentru el cuvantul ""cuddling"" inseamna sa stam in pat unul langa altul, nu sa ma atinga neaparat sau ceva, ceea ce dude, nu asta e sensul acelei actiuni. 

Un alt aspect, e foarte ciudat ca uneori simte nevoia sa se acopere in fata mea. Spre exemplu, s-a intamplat sa trebuiasca sa intru in baie pentru ceva in timp ce el era in dus si nu glumeac, simtea nevoia sa isi acopere organele genitale:))) in conditiile in care eu, daca suntem singuri in casa, nu am nicio treaba cu asta:))) mi se pare foarte ciudat sa te ascunzi asa se partener.

[SECRET] In Retro: The Glorious Revolution (Part 3),worldpowers,1hmv2fd,2024-12-26 13:52:27,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1hmv2fd/secret_in_retro_the_glorious_revolution_part_3/,King_of_Anything,SECRET,"## [Drakskepp-class Nuclear-Electric Extremely-Large Hunter-Killer Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (SSKNE-XLAUV)](https://i.imgur.com/POatJQO.jpeg)  

Building on the Nykr-class, the [**Drakskepp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longship)-class represents a further refinement of UNSC XLUUV modernization efforts on a semi-attritable unmanned platform streamlined as a nuclear [hunter-killer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_submarine) submarine, supplementing manned Viking-class SSE operations on a compact, autonomous form factor with blue water capability. While sharing several commonalities with the multirole Nykr, the Drakskepp is optimized primarily for attack and interception of hostile subsurface assets.    

In spite of its size and formidable onboard arsenal, the Drakskepp only displaces 1,200 tons. This low displacement is mostly a property of the vessel’s ultralight, ultrathin semi-[monocoque](https://www.norco.co.uk/project/submarine-composite-monocoque/) light hull constructed with ultrahydrophobic metamaterial-coated borofold-composite non-ferromagnetic self-assembling nanomaterial in a lengthened [sailless](http://www.hisutton.com/Sailless_Submarines.html) [teardrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teardrop_hull) design with [biomimetic properties]
(https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-mimicking-fish-ideal-deep-sea.html); this novel teardrop hullform is taller than it is wide and houses the XLAUV’s ambient-pressure architecture, which arranges smaller watertight borofold-composite pressure vessel “minisubs” flooded with oil within the outer hull. The Drakskepp also does away with the containerized mini-DAPPER found aboard other Allied Maritime Vessels, instead leveraging a navalized [MINOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/u6wa23/event_love_the_way_you_li) (more typically used aboard nuclear aircraft) within a two-coolant-loop and particle accelerator architecture fully-isolated from the “minisub” hull with metamaterial shock and noise absorbers. The vessel’s ambient-pressure auto-quenching aqueous Li-Air nanowire primary battery bank also serves a [structural purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_battery), and is utilized in lieu of traditional mechanical reinforcement of the various pressure hulls, providing excellent tolerances without increasing the vessel’s overall weight. The pressure vessel dedicated to the hybrid ARM-quantum photonic supercomputing datacenter houses a development branch of the Nykr’s cyberdefence-optimized fully-sentient artificial intelligence retooled for anti-submarine warfare [game theory](https://www.aimasterclass.com/glossary/game-theory-in-ai) and both lone wolf and [wolfpack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfpack_(naval_tactic\)) tactics, with the “minisub” doubling as an [escape crew capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_crew_capsule) for its resident AI.  

The vessel’s Wärtsilä integrated electric propulsion system features a novel [MHD-augmented](https://www.naval-technology.com/features/darpa-silent-mhd-magnetic-drives-for-replacing-naval-propellers/) [hydrojet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump-jet) which utilizes a pair of [rim-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rim-driven_thruster) [contra-rotating propellers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra-rotating_propellers#Use_in_water) powered by a pair of room-temperature-superconducting [brushless DC motors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor). With the Drakskepp featuring a longer, narrower hull than other submarines of its size class that provides greater hydrodynamic efficiencies, the XLUAV is capable of sustaining a submerged flank speed of 65 knots. The MINOR-integrated IEPS is also capable of operating in a mid-power, medium acoustic signature mode capable of sustaining 50 knots, and the vessel is capable of achieving speeds as high as 35 knots in its optimized silent cruising mode with the MINOR switched off, running purely on power sourced from the structural Li-Air bank and its backup supercapacitor array of digital quantum vacuum tube batteries; these battery banks can also be periodically recharged without substantially increasing the reactor’s signature by electrostatic harvesting energy via the particle deccelerator. While the MINOR is fully online, its coolant loop is processed by the same active filtration system utilized aboard the Round Table-class, which will eliminate any activation radionuclides or radioactive elements ejected from the onboard reactor. The filter will also eliminate other trace chemical elements from the remainder of the vessel’s subsystems, ensuring a very clean wake.    
 
The Drakskepp features best-of-class UNSC submarine signature reduction technologies, including the typical Mignolecule® Ink metamaterial cloaking system with physical video subsystem, conformal hydroacoustic sound generator ambient environmental flow noise simulation system, and 
hull-mounted Active Conformal MIMO Sonar Array’s active noise cancellation. The ACMSA’s hydroacoustic sensing is supplemented by the [SOKS](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a28724/submarine-sonar-soks/)-inspired [wake detection system](https://www.navylookout.com/royal-navy-submarines-and-non-acoustic-sensor-technology/) and [blue-green laser](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-04/chinese-scientists-are-developing-lasers-to-find-submarines/11570886) [underwater detection system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015SPIE.9342E..21G/abstract) developed for the Great Northern Barrage’s ULTRASUS-INFOS-Improved array and a submarine-adapted variant of the Kongsberg low frequency variable depth multi-function towed array.    

Uniquely for a combat submarine, the Drakskepp does not feature any dedicated torpedo tubes, instead reinvesting volume that would have been taken by torpedo launchers, reloaders, and magazines into a pressure vessel with a larger multipurpose VLS array. Derived from the NordVPM surface ship solution, the Drakskepp’s submarine VLS module consists of six adjacent hexes filled with a variety of coilgun adapters and multi-packed arrangements of anti-submarine missiles, UUVs, naval mines, and torpedoes, with each weapon ejected upwards electromagnetically prior to ignition. Reloaded either by crane or by ROV, each hex may contain up to:   

+ 144 x Torped 68 Dvärgkäxa, double-stacked 
+ 128 x CHASM, multi-stacked
+ 24 x Torped 66 Pigghaj 
+ 8 x Torped 64 Brugd 
+ 24 x RAW-equipped Torped 66 Pigghaj
+ 24 x CHASM-L
+ 4 x HACKS 
+ 4 x CHASM-XL 
+ 32 x SLOWER-AD 
+ Or 8 x Saab Sjörå  

The Drakskepp-class will be the first submarine to field the Torped 70 Makohaji, a wire-guided [supercavitating](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercavitating_torpedo) heavyweight torpedo capable of achieving maximum speeds in excess of [220 knots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superkavitierender_Unterwasserlaufk%C3%B6rper). While a narrower weapon than the Torped 64 heavyweight UUV, the Torped 70 is a longer N8 monopropellant rocket-powered weapon with an actuator-based pivoting conical tip. While the Makohaji still retains an onboard sonar for target acquisition by its sub-sentient AI after the [50 km-long](https://apar.com/cable_solutions/torpedo-cables/) fiber optic umbilical is severed, the weapon is likely to “blind” its acoustic receiver while supercavitating at flank speed. To offset this, the Torped 70 Makohaji features a [highly-sophisticated INS](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/uwzg6a/secret_avskräckande_resultat_med_exakt_precision/) integrating an [ultra-small low-power atomic clock](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/sensors/article/14276979/positioning-navigation-and-timing-pnt-ultrasmall-clocks) combining [portable microwave cold atomic technology](https://www.sbir.gov/node/561289) with an [ultrafast pulsed](https://idstch.com/technology/photonics/darpa-seeks-ultrafast-laser-science-improve-range-resolution-next-generation-military-navigation-communication-imaging-radar-systems/) [laser-cooled optical lattice](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2227065/us-wants-portable--rugged-atomic-clocks.html) on a [chip-scale form factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip-scale_atomic_clock). This highly accurate timepiece is used in conjunction with a [cold-atom interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_interferometer) and high-precision, self-calibrating [micromechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems) miniature gyroscopes and accelerometers built into chips each the size of a penny, creating a holistic [Micro-PNT](https://www.gps.gov/governance/advisory/meetings/2014-12/lutwak.pdf) guidance solution with incredible accuracy. The weapon also features a proximity or contact-fuzed [700 kg](http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTRussian_post-WWII.php) warhead containing an N8-composite [high-energy density nanoparticulate explosive](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/975/1/012008/pdf) matrix capable of generating [UNDEXs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_explosion) with a [TNT equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent) of 5.75 Tons, ensuring that even near misses will trigger a significant detonation shockwave and/or [bubble jet effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_mine#Bubble_jet_effect) against the target submarine. Over shorter distances, the weapon can also be issued targeting information through underwater laser datalinks via its blue laser diode receiver.   

The Torped 72 Tjurhaj is, uniquely, a heavyweight UUV without its own organic warhead, instead exclusively acting as the carrier and launch vehicle for a unitary Torped 70 Makohaji payload, which it nests in a [telescoped](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescoped_ammunition) two-stage arrangement. The Tjurhaj maintains a similar form factor to a lengthened Torped 64 Brugd, inheriting its onboard artificial intelligence and propulsion from the predecessor UUV in order to conduct long-range aqueous Li-air nanowire battery-enabled ASW patrols. The Tjurhaj will be the first UUV to complement its onboard sonar with a new subsurface RTSC [SQUID](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2144721-chinas-quantum-submarine-detector-could-seal-south-china-sea/)-based [MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_anomaly_detector) and underwater laser detection system (with these new sensors gradually propagated to existing and new-build UUV stocks). Upon identifying a target submarine, the Tjurhaj will cue a coilgun-enabled electromagnetic launch of the recessed Makohaji, acting as an offboard data-fused sonar/MAD/laser sensor and command and control unit for the supercavitating torpedo via either a 5km-long fibre tether or remote laser datalink as part of a wider underwater networked architecture. The Tjurhaj is a fully-reusable UUV solution, and can be reloaded with a new supercavitating torpedo via ROV or crane following recovery. The Torped 72 can also be installed as part of a HACKS anti-submarine missile (marrying the torpedo-nested UUV to a VLS-launched NEO PARADIGM-Sea-R), and therefore can also be encapsulated within a CHASM-XL naval mine for persistent area denial.   

In addition to the contents of the vessel’s NordVPM VLS magazine, the Drakskepp features four recessed containerized coilgun launchers behind tensile metamaterial hatches quad-packed with supercavitating Active-defence Naval Torpedo Interceptors (ANTIs) for terminal active self-defence against hostile torpedos. The XLUAV also supplements its role as a drone mothership with a compact internal missions space integrating waterproofed robotics and ROVs. Effectively a miniature derivative of the Nykr’s LASH without its own power or propulsion, the missions space enables a single ASUAV 14B Maritime Glador or two Hjälm V-300 XLs to be stowed, launched, recovered, rearmed, recharged, and maintained.   

The Drakskepp-class will be procured following the end of Nykr production, with all units delivered between 2084-2088. In order to ensure sufficient capacity exists for the UNSC’s submarine shipbuilding docks, the [Damen Shipyards Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damen_Group) has received a subcontract for production of a significant number of hulls at [Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdamsche_Droogdok_Maatschappij).

##[Junker-class Anti-Submarine Mine Warfare Missile Patrol Boat Unmanned Surface Vehicle (PG-USV)](https://i.imgur.com/AovHLF8.jpeg)   

Effectively a domestic replacement for the aging [Silent Neptune LEUSV](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/okgpnm/secret_st_marine_presents_silent_neptune_long/), the [**Junker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junker)-class represents a departure from the traditional STOICS Allied Maritime Command emphasis on large, sophisticated naval platforms. Effectively a modern [submarine chaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_chaser), the Junker is a stealthy fully-unmanned, attritable hybrid of the [ASW patrol boat](https://couach.com/en/2800-fpb-asw-2/) and [missile boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_boat) concepts designed to supplement anti-submarine patrols of littoral and coastal defence zones within a permissive TRIADS environment and expeditionary carrier operations as part of a CVBG’s Hunter-Killer Group formation. The 235-ton stealth boat is designed with sufficient seakeeping for ocean-going patrols, but maintains a [planing hull](https://www.boat-ed.com/indiana/studyGuide/Planing-Hulls/10101602_35111/) and four powerful waterjets in order to achieve its [60 knot](https://www.dmsonline.us/go-fast-boat-pros-and-cons-of-a-planing-hull) flank speed.   

The vessel relies on an all-electric architecture without a navalized nuclear reactor in order to keep costs low. The Junker's onboard power is provided by a modular conformal auto-quenching Li-Air nanowire battery bank providing extreme energy density, with sufficient energy stores for two months of continuous, low-power operation and two weeks with all systems actively draining energy during a fast cruise. The USV can be supercharged in as little as two hours by STOICS Allied Maritime Command UNREP vessels or any surface warship equipping a Eurodocker station, and spent battery modules can be physically swapped out in order to expedite the process. The Junker also enables two-way [“buddy store”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling#Buddy_store)-style recharging via a miniature AUV docking station on the aft of the vessel, allowing it to either recharge or be recharged by UUVs.   

At first glance, the majority of the Junker does not appear to provide a major capabilities improvement over the Silent Neptune, with designers content to integrate UNSC substitutes for the vast majority of the LEUSV’s subsystems. The PG-USV features multiple sub-sentient artificial intelligences for a variety of onboard tasks within an EMP-hardened hybrid ARM-quantum computing datacenter, and maintains a comprehensive ASW sensor suite with a cut-down hull-mounted ACSMA sonar derivative, the lightweight dipping sonar/acoustic modem fielded aboard the Hjälm V-300 XL, and the most compact (XS) variant of the Kongsberg variable depth multi-function towed array. The Junker also integrates several underwater sensors developed for ULTRASUS-Improved, including an RTSC SQUID--based MAD sensor, hull-mounted LED diving “searchlights” underwater blue-green laser detection diodes, and a multi-spectral wake detection system; collectively these allow the Junker to also be utilized for naval minesweeping operations in addition to ASW. The vessel’s superstructure integrates the BUDGETS family GEMMA substitute as its primary radar, near-IR QLiDAR sensor, and uncooled infrared focal plane array-enabled IIR suite. The ship’s guidance and communications suite is also BUDGETS-derived, with a STONKS GNSS interface, Micro-PNT, point-to-point laser datalinks, and a post-quantum/QKD-encrypted RF antenna.   

Where the Junker mainly distinguishes itself from its Nusantaran predecessor, however, is with its weapons density and variety, aggregating multiple launch systems for different weapons types into a unified XL variant of the Modular Aggregated Weapons Launcher (MAWL), which marries the CEMLS-XL with [Light Common Launcher (LCL)](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2009-03-25-Lockheed-Martins-HIMARS-Launcher-Successfully-Fires-Air-Defense-Missile) and [MML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Mission_Launcher) architectures. The vessel’s four MAWL-XL canisters are distributed across two rotating conformal deck launchers and fully support multi-packing of various munitions sets; the MAWL-XLs can host a dozen RAW-equipped Torped 66 Lightweight UUVs as an organic anti-submarine missile capability, enable wide-area saturation of as many as 72 x Torped 68 Dvärgkäxa ultralight UUVs delivered by 135mm guided rockets, or perform rapid electromagnetic ejection of CHASM, CHASM-Ls, stock UUVs, and sonobuoys over the sides or rear of the ship. While not its primary missions set, the Junker’s MAWL-XLs can also be reconfigured for ASuW and coastal bombardment via the addition of 4 x NSM-XER AShMs or THUNDERground TBMs, 64 XXS/ 32 XS/ 16 S/ 8 M CHEAPO-SHOTS, 48 x WEEs, 28 x GEARs, 52 x RBS 57 Heavy ATGMs, 92 x Ascalon ATGMs, or 72 x ARAK m/70B 135mm semi-active laser homing rockets. In spite of a suboptimal onboard radar, the integration of LCL/MML capability enables the Junker to serve as an offboard launch platform for surface-to-air missiles in a CULSANS/SAINTS/OPTIMUS-enabled Aegis-Improved Combat System cooperative engagement capability environment, enabling its use as a mini arsenal ship with optional rails installed for 4 x JETSAM MAD-SAM/MADDISH-SAM/MADCAP-SAM, 8 x E-SAM/SLHAMMER, 16 x S-SAM/I-SAM missiles, or 292 x RBS 72 Slaktarfågel MANPADs. The MAWL-XLs feature a smart ignition system enabling different weapons classes to be packed into the same canister with each munition launched on an individual basis; this enables MANPADS for the Junker’s defence against low-flying aviation to be packed into the same launch tube as an anti-submarine missile, enabling a cleaner VLO superstructure profile for the stealth boat. The deck space freed by aggregating multiple launch systems aboard MAWL-XLs has been reinvested into a stealth cupola-mounted 57 mm L/70 ETC BLLP Naval gun firing either BAE Kingfisher ASW/minesweeping munitions or guided multipurpose surface/AD rounds specifically adapted for the smaller diameter of the weapon, a single conformal quad-packed containerized ANTI coilgun launcher APS embedded into the vessel’s aft hull, and a small beam director turret hosting a Dagr 54 kW XLaser XUV FEL and coaxial CHAMBER directed energy array. The Junker also fields a small helipad and miniature containerized telescopic hangar for a single [Hjälm V-300 UAV](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/tmm8j3/tech_weird_wings/), which serves as an additional airborne BUDGETS sensor node or as a vehicle for remote deployment of lightweight ASW payloads including sonobuoys and Torped 68 Dvärgkäxas.   

The 64 x Silent Neptunes in Allied Maritime Command service will be decommissioned on a one-for-one basis as Junkers come online, with the older Nusantaran LEUSVs utilized as OPFOR/Aggressor systems during UNSC wargames. A total of 266 ASW Missile Patrol Boat USVs will be procured by 2086.

## [ASUAV 14B Maritime Glador and ASUAV 17 Marulv-Medium ASW Missions Payloads](https://i.imgur.com/PJLya5a.jpeg)   

The Maritime Glador stopped-rotor and Marulv-Medium high-speed VTOL tilt-rotor compatibility with [STOICS destroyer and frigate aviation facilities](https://theaviationist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Concept-Art-V-280-706x397.jpg) make both of these aircraft excellent candidates for rotary-wing ASW operations, but both platforms are currently solely reliant on only lightweight dipping sonar for submarine detection.   

Going forwards, the smaller Glador’s deployable dipping sonar module has been augmented with a [heliborne digital SQUID-based MAD sensor](https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2020/lockheed-martin-to-develop-digital-magnetic-anomaly-detection-sensor-into-the-mh-60r-seahawk-helicopter), and the aircraft’s weapons module will now include sonobuoys as part of its inventory. 

The larger Marulv-Medium will receive a more capable ASW missions package transforming it into a VTOL-capable [S-3 Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_S-3_Viking) equivalent via the addition of a larger SQUID-based MAD boom and a powerful [blue-green laser detection system](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1993/march/finding-submerged-submarines-lasers) based on the mature [submarine-to-air quantum communications system](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5038406A/en) utilized by STOICS vast undersea fleet. Compact containerized DAS/DSS/DPS payloads sized for the internal volume of the stopped-rotor platform will also be developed, making the Marulv-Medium the smallest airborne platform capable of deploying ULTRASUS-Improved elements. The tilt-rotor’s retractable weapons racking system has been updated, enabling wire-guided launch of the Torped 70 Makohaji supercavitating heavyweight torpedo, deployment of the Torped 72 Tjurhaj UUV, and sonobuoy drops. The aircraft’s YEET roll-on inventory has also been updated to include palletized launch of the RAW-equipped Torped 66 Pigghaj anti-submarine missile and CHASM-L mine.   

A sufficient number of modules for both aircraft will be procured to enable rollout of ASW across their entire fleets.  


## [UAV 18 Marulv-Heavy MPA Missions Payload](https://i.imgur.com/kHZRNnc.jpeg)  

Taking advantage of the platform’s larger size, greater endurance, and more substantial payload capacity, the Marulv-Heavy will receive a net-new modular missions payload aimed at rapidly transforming the heavy-lift high-speed tilt-rotor into a capable maritime patrol aircraft supplementing high-end purpose-built MPAs like the Saab Hræsvelgr. This MPA module will upcycle the Marulv-Medium’s SQUID-based MAD boom and blue-green laser detector, substantially enlarging the former and increasing the number of diodes for the latter in order to enable more capable target acquisition of undersea assets. Because the Marulv-Heavy does not operate a weapons module, the aircraft’s inventory of YEET pallets will now include stock Torped 64 Brugd/Torped66 Pigghaj/Torped 72 Tjurhaj UUVs, RAW-equipped Torped 66 Pigghaj anti-submarine missiles, Torped 64 Brugd/Torped 72 Tjurhaj-equipped HACKS anti-submarine missiles, CHASM/CHASM-L/CHASM-XL naval mines, sonobuoys, and ULTRASUS-Improved  DAS/DSS/DPS containers. Sufficient modules of this type will be procured to enable full MPA conversion of the Marulv-Heavy fleet, on demand.  

## [COMPASS containerized NeuDAR](https://i.imgur.com/NNT7wbW.png) 

[Neutrino detection](https://thedebrief.org/darpas-secretive-new-neutrino-detector-program-could-be-a-game-changer-for-global-underwater-military-surveillance/) as a method of ocean surveillance for the tracking of nuclear submarines has been previously explored, with fission and even [aneutronic fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion) reactors consistently [producing these subatomic particles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2934-0). The main challenge facing the practical military application of [detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_detector) is size;  the physical properties of the neutrinos demand the construction and operation of extremely-large static purpose-built facilities.  

The [King’s College of London Neutrino Detection And Ranging (NeuDAR) proposal](https://indico.ph.liv.ac.uk/event/1195/contributions/7106/attachments/3083/4246/goldsack_snifr_aap_2023.pdf) upends the traditional neutrino detector paradigm by installing a functioning detector aboard an ocean-going vessel. Instead of a purpose-built warship, the NeuDAR proposal relies on the assembly of a neutrino detector aboard a civilian cargo vessel by joining multiple marinized 20-foot ISO intermodal containers, lending the concept extremely well to an extension of the [COMPASS](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/q8hgfn/secret_mercy_sakes_alive_looks_like_we_got_us_a/) solution already utilized by the Merchant Marine. These containers would each contain several internal detectors with external connections, mating to form a massive, multi-segmented [water-based quantum dot](https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-dot-liquid-scintillator-could-revolutionize-neutrino-detection/) [Scintillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Scintillator_Neutrino_Detector).   

NeuDAR provides STOICS with environmental-agnostic detection of nuclear submarines operating at depth, with extremely-conservative estimates pointing towards a submarine operating a small 50 MW reactor being detectable within a 2 km radius of a solitary COMPASS-equipped container ship. Target acquisition ranges are expected to be greater than 10 km if the submarine is operating one or more 100-200 MW reactors (which naturally produce more neutrinos), and even greater ISR ranges are achievable via triangulation of readings taken by multiple NeuDAR vessels. Given foreign navies traditionally use always-on 100-200MW nuclear reactors aboard their SSNs, this new system provides an extremely reliable (if short-range) supplement to SONAR-equipped platforms, operating even during adverse weather, environmental, and sea state conditions that would degrade acoustic methods of detection.  

At $100 Million per holistic detector, NeuDAR represents the most expensive of the COMPASS options (which roughly average out to $20 Million). Likewise, due to the limitations of the technology, NeuDAR-equipped COMPASS container vessels are expected to operate in groups of two or more exclusively beneath a permissive TRIADS umbrella, and will therefore be utilized primarily within the limits of the Great Northern Barrage. Four dozen COMPASS containerized NeuDAR solutions will be procured and dispersed to Naval Auxiliary civilian operators by 2086, where they will begin patrolling alongside other Great Northern Barrage mobile component assets.  

## [Airborne Monostatic VLF Radar Array](https://i.imgur.com/6mpbrCA.png)   

Seawater as a medium is extremely effective at the [absorption of a vast majority of radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water), making the oceans extremely opaque to most forms of radar and limiting [submarine communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_submarines) to the [VLF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency) and [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_low_frequency) bands. That said, the ability for the latter radio frequencies to penetrate seawater has led to the evaluation of [ELF Radar](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD1011948.pdf) solutions for the purpose of submarine detection. While STOICS engineers agree with the assessment of the former-US Naval Air Development Center that “development of a practical ELF radar for the detection of completely submerged submarines at normal operational depths in sea water does not appear feasible”, the UNSC is experienced in the use of [VLF submarine communications technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noviken_VLF_Transmitter) and believes that certain platforms can be leveraged towards the creation of a functional and mobile VLF radar solution.    

The UNSC implementation of its VLF solution involves leveraging its domestic competencies in flexible metamaterial design, airborne communications network formation, and massive inventory of long-endurance unmanned aerial systems towards the creation of a flying holistic [monostatic radar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/monostatic-radar) array. The initial challenge to overcome involves the radar antennae; in order to receive and transmit very low frequency waves, each antenna must by design be over a kilometer in length. SAAB has tackled this issue via development of an appropriately-long ultralight [textile-based metamaterial antenna](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-56438-3_17) containing [flexible graphene](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8888651) photonic integrated circuitry that is unrolled from a spool with a small [drag chute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogue_parachute) attached to one end. This [dipole antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna) acts almost like the aerial equivalent of a [towed array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towed_array_sonar) and is capable of both sending and receiving VLF signals (also making it usable as a software-defined post-quantum/QKD-encrypted VLF transmitter and receiver for communications with subsurface assets), and SAAB has designed the solution to be rapidly scaleable by joining multiple antennae end-to-end in order to create dipoles as long as 10km.       

In order to satisfy the requirements for a radar capable of operating on wavelengths approximating 30 kHz, the [λ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar#Radar_range_equation) over two dipoles will need to be, at the bare minimum, 5 kilometers. This required spacing increases as the frequency lowers, all the way up to 50 km for VLF frequencies in the 3 kHz range. Likewise, achieving usable [directivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directivity) requires forming an array of 10+ elements. In combination, a practical VLF radar at λ/2 spacing would need to be between 50-500 km wide. Thus, the only way an array of this magnitude could possibly be assembled is by distributing the dipoles across multiple aircraft, which would collectively form a massive holistic airborne monostatic radar with only a single transmitter and receiver.   

Towards this end, STOICS has authorized development of a family of [externally-mounted enclosed pods](https://news.usni.org/2013/08/28/boeing-pitches-advanced-super-hornet) which are designed to [conform to the exterior of a stealthy aircraft without degrading its VLO RCS](https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_old_pdf.cfm?ARC_ID=1079) that is compatible with several STOICS ISR UAVs (e.g. CALOR, Njord PERHAPS, Spindelvav PERHAPS). Each pod would contain a spooled dipole 1-10 kilometers in length, and would be attached either dorsally or ventrally to the UAV as required. The spool would also be deployable as a payload option for STOICS VLO UAVs with enclosed weapons bays, with the deployed antenna designed to hang out even while the bay doors are shut.  

In order to form a VLF radar array, a single formation of 10 or more aircraft would deploy their dipoles, maintaining consistent spacing and leveraging a combination of post-quantum/QKD-encrypted low-probability-of-intercept RF and laser datalinks to form a local, secured intranet. While flying at the same altitude, these 50-500km-wide formations are capable of resolving radar returns up to [depths of 60 meters](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-geophysics/very-low-frequency-electromagnetic-vlf), placing the [typical missile launch depth of 40-50 m](https://www.brahmos.com/content.php?id=20) utilized by SSNs and SSGNs well-within the radar’s constraints. The VLF radar will also be applicable towards maritime patrols of littoral zones and shallow bodies of water such as the [Baltic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea), with signals discrimination initially conducted collectively by the formation via [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), before being offloaded to AEW&C or C3 assets via CULSANS/SAINTS for further processing and analytics.  

While originally intended for submarine detection, the VLF radar formation can also be oriented towards airborne early warning and signals intelligence. In order to achieve this, instead of operating at the same altitude, multiple dipole-deploying UAVs will be tasked to form a vertical radar transmitter and receiver by flying in a stacked formation travelling perpendicular to the direction that requires monitoring. This orientation also allows the formation to be utilized as a VLF passive radar or ESM/ELINT receiver, providing particularly useful signals intelligence on attempts made to contact hostile submarines.    

STOICS has put forwards an order for a sufficient stockpile of components to form fifty of these VLF radar arrays, distributed between SVALINN and Allied Maritime Command assets. Deliveries of all requisite systems are expected by no later than 2086.

## [ASUAV 14 Glador AEW Missions Payload](https://imgur.com/9DGy9Tz)   

The ASUAV 14B Maritime Glador serves as the primary ASW and utility LAMPS helicopter analog for STOICS Allied Maritime forces, complementing larger tilt-rotor solutions on a compact stopped-rotor platform with both rotary-wing and fixed wing jet aircraft performance envelopes. In order to provide the aircraft (and its land-based counterpart, the ASUAV 14A)  with a capability similar to [AEW helicopters](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-gb/products/crowsnest.html), a compact airborne early warning missions payload has been developed which takes advantage of the Glador’s 1000 kg modular capacity. A compact derivative of the Marulv-Medium’s underslung lightweight GEMMA maritime surveillance radar has been retooled for airborne search-and-track, with multiple conformal MIMO antennae installed on the cheeks, sides, and underside of the aircraft in order to transform the majority of its airframe into a flying radar array. This conformal arrangement preserves most of the aircraft’s VLO RCS shaping, minimizing its radar signature while operating as a passive radar, multistatic receiver element, or ELINT platform; the Glador is also able to utilize its GEMMA as an emitting monostatic radar solution in order to prosecute more accurate long-range tracks, but this will increase its visibility on the electromagnetic spectrum. The AEW module also includes installation of a fully-sentient airborne early warning and maritime surveillance artificial intelligence acting as a command officer for a suite of subsentient AIs, with optional seating and consoles for up to three human air controllers or data analysts, collectively providing mini-[JSTARs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_E-8_Joint_STARS) and HITL decision-making. While the AEW Glador is unable to fully replace more-capable AEW&C aviation platforms, greater distribution of early warning across the broader STOICS force will enable better situational awareness through more comprehensive ISR, a particularly-beneficial capability to the UNSC’s maritime expeditionary forces when facing the overhanging threat of anti-ship missile saturation.

The submarine is perhaps the most unique of the asymmetric platforms threatening the UNSC CVBG. In addition to being incredibly difficult to detect and impressive endurance (that is, for nuclear platforms), the submarine is the only weapons system capable of leveraging three or more attack vectors against the carrier formation simultaneously from a launch position in relative proximity. While previous efforts have neutered the efficacy of SSGNs, STOICS Allied Maritime Command continues to prioritize Anti-Submarine Warfare as a key component of the *Arorika Revolutionen Doktrin*, with aims to degrade the effectiveness of near-peer submarine fleets.  

 
## [Flight II Frigates](https://i.imgur.com/64cSZJB.jpeg)  

While the Deacon and Berserker frigate classes undergo minor systems upgrades to allow them to better operate under the Stadtholder-enabled Aegis-Improved umbrella, the Flight II of the Deadly-class FFH will see the substantial lengthening of the ASW frigate (without compromising the vessel’s VLO RCS) in order to integrate additional aviation facilities, raising the capacity of the vessel’s flight deck and supporting a total of [three LAMPS systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruna-class_destroyer). This configuration will enable the Marulv-Medium to operate in concert with an ASUAV 14B Maritime Glador and enables larger numbers of ASW UAV assets to be stowed, with as many as  4 x Hjälm V-300-XLs or 6 x Hjälm V-300s to be coordinated by a single Maritime Glador. Additionally,  an expandable [telescopic helicopter hangar](https://www.igus.com/cable-carriers/applications/vector-helicopter-hangar-com) can be optionally installed to extend the standard enclosed hangar space further, increasing the number of aircraft carried. 

Internal volume gained by lengthening the vessel will also be used to house the Large variant of the Kongsberg Variable depth multi-function towed array sonar, which is typically found aboard destroyers. This addition makes the Deadly-class Flight II the smallest STOICS Allied Maritime vessel to host a towed sonar solution of this caliber.  

The Deadly-class 76mm ETC BLLP naval gun has also received a compatible [BAE Kingfisher](https://www.navylookout.com/the-kingfisher-gun-launched-anti-submarine-munition/) round and [guided multipurpose ammunition](https://www.leonardo.com/en/press-release-detail/-/detail/the-strales-76mm-system-with-dart-guided-ammunition), enhancing the vessel’s lethality against a wider array of threats.  

While upgrades are being undertaken across the existing frigate fleet, the 5 x Type 23 Duke and 8 x Type 26 City class frigates will be decommissioned and placed under reserve fleet jurisdiction. These 13 vessels will be replaced on a 1:1 basis with new-build Deadly-class Flight IIs, with the final vessels delivered by the end of 2086.

## [Round Table-class Anti-Submarine Warfare Carrier](https://i.imgur.com/IelOpVo.jpeg)  

Named in honor of the [historic Royal Navy LSLs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table-class_landing_ship_logistics), the **Round Table-class** represents a modern revival of the [ASW Carrier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare_carrier) intended to serve as the nucleus of the CVBG's [hunter-killer group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-killer_Group). This new naval formation is designed to complement the Carrier Strike, Surface Action, and Subsurface Action Groups within a wider CVBG structure by serving as the premier task unit for anti-submarine operations.  

The Round Table-class is effectively a [light fleet carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_aircraft_carrier) optimized for stopped-rotor, rotary-wing, and drone operations from a stealthy maritime platform with a substantially-reduced human crewed presence enabled by a significantly-high degree of automation. This ASW carrier inherits many of the elements of the [Uí Ímair-class supercarrier](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/rzzv4s/secret_uí_ímairclass_aircraft_carrier/), but downsized to dimensions more reminiscent of the deactivated [Landsdelar-class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo-class_destroyer). Like the Landsdelar, a pair of [EMKitten](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/q1o1w6/secret_spetsen_p%C3%A5_spjutet/) miniature EMALS and lightweight arresting gear have been integrated into the design, in order to enable CATOBAR launch of fixed wing UAS systems in support of persistent stopped-rotor and rotary-wing operations via distributed maritime ISR, additional ASW weapons delivery, rearmament, and refueling. The vessel’s primary onboard artificial intelligence is the [**Unified Representative Integrated Enabler Naval Superintelligence (URIENS)**](https://nightbringer.se/the-legend-of-king-arthur/arthurian-characters/u-arthurian-characters/uriens-of-rheged/), a sapient AI based on the KAMI solution. Hosted within the vessel’s EMP-hardened hybrid-quantum supercomputing array, URIENS has been issued a wider scope of responsibilities than its predecessor; the AI superintelligence is tasked with navigation and steering of the vessel in addition to coordination of automated rearmament and refueling pipelines, optimized scheduling and direction of combat and logistics aircraft to the correct elevators, stations, and catapults in order to guarantee high flow through rates. Human personnel aboard the Round Table are expected to provide man-in-the-loop decision making, facilitate orders prioritized by the AI, conduct maintenance in concert with the vessel’s automated repair systems, and perform damage control tasks alongside supporting robotics. When not engaged in command operations for the Hunter-Killer Group, the Round Table can also be tasked for [dual](https://news.usni.org/2021/02/10/admiral-no-abnormal-responses-from-china-after-dual-carrier-drills) and [multi](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/01/us-french-and-italian-navies-to-conduct-tri-carrier-operations/) carrier strike group operations out of the box, providing auxiliary carrier capabilities across larger fleet operations aimed at [pushing into challenging “A2/AD” environments](https://www.cpf.navy.mil/newsroom/news/article/2635169/theodore-roosevelt-nimitz-carrier-strike-groups-conduct-dual-carrier-operations/).     

In addition to serving as a platform for the employment of ASW aviation, the Round Table-class will also serve a secondary role as a surface-based [drone mothership](https://www.naval-technology.com/news/first-of-joint-belgian-dutch-drone-motherships-begins-sea-trials/) with organic undersea tactical network C3 node infrastructure. Towards this end, the Round Table-class inherits the Sagokungar-class IVAR AI as a subservient system to URIENS, spools containing over 300 kilometers of optical fibre cabling for physical P2P connections, short-range VLF radio underwater datalinks, high-speed broadband Kongsberg/Konigsberg QKD-Encrypted Acoustic Frequency (AF) modems and transducers, and optical communications narrowbeam blue laser diodes enabling command and coordination of anti-submarine missiles, subsurface submarines, torpedoes, mines, sonobuoys, hydrophones, and UUVs for ASW via a mixture of kinetic methods, electronic warfare and cyberattacks. While the vessel’s air wing is preferred for the launch and recovery of autonomous underwater vehicles, the Round Table also includes a retractable crane and [Eurodocker AUV Docking Station](https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/MT01/MT01041FU.pdf) as backup systems.   

Unlike the larger Uí Ímair, the Round Table-class maintains a Landsdelar-inspired single-level flight deck layout (with a pair of large aircraft elevators and four smaller weapons and logistics elevators) to maximize deck footprint for stopped-rotor and rotary-wing flight operations, ringed by an inverted skirt of RCS shrouds. Aside from substantial VLO geometry, including a wave-piercing bow and single truncated pyramid island (overlaid with a GEMMA pilot wave conformal quantum photonic graphene MIMO AESA array for software-defined radar, communications, ELINT, and electronic warfare, an ultra-long-range quantum LiDAR, a 360-degree wideband 128K EO/IR/UV/VL electro-optical fire control director leveraging sub-0.01 arcsec hyperspectral imaging CNT nanoantenna camera array and pilot wave quantum-dot-based single-photon avalanche detectors, and other sensors and electronics), the Mignolecule® Ink-based negative refractive index metamaterial dynamic cloaking system has been baked into the hull itself, reducing its visual and electromagnetic signature even from directly overhead.   

Below the waterline, the Round Table-class features many of the signature reduction and mitigation technologies found aboard UNSC submarines. The vessel features a Viking-class derived grafold composite hull that is both thin and non-magnetic (reducing the chance of recognition by magnetic anomaly detectors). Onboard power is reminiscent of Nuclear-Electric SSNEs, with a 100 MW navalized [solid-state](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Compact-solid-state-nuclear-reactor-with-direct-generation-of-electricity-from-nuclear_fig1_251709897) [mini-DAPPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/tsjpbp/secret_warhawks/) fusion reactor with [two-coolant loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_coolant) architecture powering a [Rankine Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_cycle) generator and an integrated particle deccelerator for [electrostatic energy capture](https://imgur.com/7lOVTGr); the entire reactor’s infrastructure is mounted on vibration-absorbing metamaterial pads in order to minimize ambient sound. Uniquely, the Round Table’s navalized mini-DAPPER incorporates the same technologies as SVALINN nuclear aircraft, which host reactors designed to be shut off and restarted for regular maintenance. The vessel’s mini-DAPPER can therefore be completely disabled as part of a “silent running” mode reminiscent of undersea platforms, with the ship’s onboard power requirements instead supplied by a large bank of modular conformal auto-quenching Li-Air nanowire batteries supported by digital quantum vacuum tube batteries acting as a supercapacitor array. When required, the Round Table’s reactor can be rapidly switched on again using a cold start process undertaken in 90% less time than comparable mini-DAPPER restarts. Propulsion for the Round Table is provided by the same derivative of the Clac Harald’s Wärtsilä integrated electric propulsion system found aboard the Sagokungar and Viking-class submarines, which substitutes legacy waterjets for a pair of rim-driven thruster Hydrojets with an MHD flow noise reduction mechanism and [FLAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/ryjfez/secretfleet_location_active_tampering_flat/) integration to eliminate Kelvin wake turbulence. Areas of the hull below the waterline are coated in an ultrahydrophobic metamaterial coating and lined with metamaterial shock and noise absorbers; submerged areas of the hull-integrated Mignolecule® Ink metamaterial cloaking system maintain physical video subsystems tooled to alter the vessel’s exterior at the nanoscale to generate hydrodynamic acoustic effects. The ship also features conformal hydroacoustic sound generators for ambient environmental flow noise simulation and the usual Active Conformal MIMO Sonar Array’s active noise cancellation system. Finally, in order to minimize the vessel’s heat signature, the Round Table-class features a directional metamaterial heat pump and radiator system designed to diffuse heat buildup either into the atmosphere or into the surrounding ocean across a wide surface area, enabling the vessel’s IR signature to be dynamically altered to accommodate likely threats. The Round Table will also incorporate a unique filtration system designed to eliminate any activation radionuclides or radioactive elements ejected from the onboard coolant loop and other trace chemical elements.  

The integration of these systems into a holistic visual, radar, hydroacoustic, wake, heat, magnetic, and chemical signature mitigation package provide the Round Table with the ability to perform covert ASW flight operations utilizing stealthy stopped-rotor systems like the Glador and Marulv platforms (which include heavily-noise-suppressed propellers) that are extremely difficult to detect with submarine-equipped ISR solutions, such as passive sonar or optronic/ESM masts.   

The Round Table’s air wing will be the first carrier-based aviation force to field air-launched [anti-submarine missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-submarine_missile), expediting delivery of UUV payloads against detected submarine threats. The vessel’s development will be undertaken in parallel with separations testing of the Rocket-powered Accessory Wingkit (RAW)-equipped Torped 66 Pigghaj lightweight UUV via the Maritime Glador and Marulv-Medium platforms. Likewise, the Torped 68 Dvärgkäxa will also be married to a 135mm rocket motor and integrated with the ARAK m/70B rocket pod and semi-active laser homing seeker, providing a massable guided rocket delivery system for the ultralight UUV. Finally, the Marulv-Medium’s substantial lifting capacity has been leveraged towards weapons integration of up to two of the Heavyweight Anti-submarine Cruise Kill Solution (HACKS), allowing standoff missile delivery of the Torped 64 Brugd Heavyweight UUV from a pair of retractable reinforced weapons racks. These weapons will first see IOC aboard the HMS *Sir Bedivere*, before wider roll-out to Allied Maritime Command operators of compatible platforms.    

The first three ships of class, the HMS *Sir Bedivere*, HMS *Sir Galahad*, and HMS *Sir Lancelot*, will see commissioning in 2078, with three ships delivered every four years until the final vessels are completed in 2086.

Myrcella ,Valiria,1hi6r14,2024-12-19 18:54:37,18,0.91,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Valiria/comments/1hi6r14/myrcella/,picadejoso,Livros,"Myrcella é tipo a Beyonce. Um nome basta.

Myrcella Baratheon, por mais que não tenha o sangue de Rei Robert (e criação menos ainda). Myrcella Lannister, por mais que seja bastarda. Myrcella Waters, por mais que seja princesa. Não importa.

Uma coisa que importa, e que particularmente acho curioso, é como no fandom de ASOIAF, a propaganda de Stannis foi efetiva. Papo de Goebbels desentortar o pé. Quase todos tratam Joff, Myrcella e Tommen como bastardos, como se a verdade importasse. Esse jogo já seguiu, não dá para chamar esse var. Salvo Stannis, e talvez alguns nortenhos, esse papo de bastardia já virou uma divertida curiosidade do passado. Mesmo e especialmente Dorne a trata como herdeira legítima. Myrcella é indubitavelmente Princesa Myrcella.

Eles são ""legalmente legítimos"". Poderia entrar em outros exemplos e conjecturar teorias ""legais"", mas podemos só concordar que a garota nunca será simplesmente posta de lado.

E seria um crime fazê-lo. É uma filha de Cersei com Jaime. A única filha de ambos. A única neta de Lord Tywin e de Joanna. Uma verdadeira puro sangue Lannister, mesmo tendo a mácula de ter nascido Baratheon perante a lei, e do lado errado do lençol perante os deuses.

Myrcella aparece em apenas três livros, apesar de ser citada em todos. É citada 176 vezes, aliás, e podem ficar tranquilos que não vou tratar da maioria.

Primeiro a vemos com os olhos de Jon Snow.

*Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess* *Myrcella* *on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided she was insipid. Robb didn't even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.*

*Logo atrás veio Robb, de lã cinza com detalhes em branco, cores dos Stark. Vindo de braços dados com Princesa Myrcella. Ela era o esboço de uma novinha de nem oito anos, seu cabelo uma cascata de cachos dourados sob uma rede de joias. Jon ""fragou"" os olhares tímidos que ela dava a Robb enquanto eles passavam pelas mesas, e o jeito tímido que ela sorria para ele. Ele decidiu que ela era insípida. Robb nem tinha o bom senso de notar quão estúpida era ela; ele sorria como um tolo. (Tradução livre)*

Caralho, Jon Snow! Essa descrição diz muito mais sobre você do que sobre a Myrcellinda. Passamos o pano porque você é o príncipe que foi prometido etc. e essa estava sendo uma fase difícil para você; contudo é um rancor muito mal direcionado. O Lord Snow do livro cinco faria uma descrição muito diferente, tenho certeza.

De toda forma tem verdades que aparecem de qualquer jeito. Martin nos mostra aqui uma perfeita princesa donzela. Para além da egrégia aparência, temos ""olhares envergonhados"" e ""sorrisos tímidos"". Jon também a chama de ""insípida"", que no Brasil costumamos chamar de ""insossa"" ou ""sem sal"". Pra mim, destemperado que sou, são três qualidades incríveis em uma garota. Toda princesa é só uma garota, e toda garota é uma princesa. Myrcella ser bastarda ou não é irrelevante aqui.

E porra ela tinha oito anos. Myrcella cumpriu seu papel, tal qual Robb com seu sorriso bobo. Acho que o Jovem Lobo nem se atentou que ela poderia ser sua futura esposa. Seu sorriso bobo era, provavelmente, pela beleza da princesa ser diferente. Allys Kastark, quando mais nova do que Myrcella, foi instruída para jogar charme no herdeiro do Norte; tais situações não eram incomuns para ele.

No entanto o (pré) adolescente tem uma espécie de evento canônico na sua vida. Quando ele percebe que as crianças mais novas mais bonitas dão ideia para ele de uma forma que não davam na sua idade. Tipo Dante e Beatriz. Provavelmente o Robb de nove anos não causaria a mesma reação na Myrcella. Acho que seu sorriso bobo era por simplesmente ser quem era, se entender, estar nessa fase maravilhosa da vida. O Jon com inveja por ser bastardo (curioso que a bastarda é ela) que enxergou um romance onde não tinha.

Acho que não tem ninguém no fandom que questiona a beleza de Myrcella.

*She had all of* *her mother's beauty, and none of her nature.*

*Ela herdou toda a beleza de sua mãe, e nada de sua natureza. (Tradução livre)*

Tyrion, num duplo elogio a sua sobrinha. Myrcella tem cachos dourados, olhos de esmeralda e lábios de Angelina Jolie. Delicada, bonita e cortês. Esperta, corajosa e inteligente pra idade. Papo de melhor descrição das crônicas. A ilustração dela que eu mais gosto é a da/do Sacha Angel Diener. Acredito ser a mais famosa.

Essa personalidade perfeita da princesa, serve a história agora, para fazer um paralelo com a rebeldia da Arya Stark (*""Myrcella is a little baby""*). Vemos o dia de costura, e toda a convivência entre as crianças nobres e seus entourages. Martin mostra isso tudo muito bem. Gosto especialmente do detalhe da Arya notar que a costura da Myrcella não era nada demais, e mesmo assim era elogiada como se fosse a Zuzu Angel.

Myrcella, assim como a sua única avó, sofre de um preconceito do bem que assola mulheres loiras de olhos claros. Especialmente as fofas. A da pré suposição de uma bondade intrínseca, que nunca habitou um único corpo humano! Adoro outro detalhe que o Martin nos dá, a forma como Myrcella e Tommen, já em Porto Real, lidam com a Arya ao não reconhecê-la como filha de Lord Eddard.

*Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen, Arya thought. A septa as large as a draft horse hovered over them, and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks, Lannister house guards.""What were you doing to that cat, boy?"" Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her brother she said, ""He's a ragged boy, isn't he? Look at him."" She giggled.""A ragged dirty smelly boy,"" Tommen agreed. They don't know me, Arya realized.*

*Princesa Myrcella e Príncipe Tommen, pensou Arya. Uma septã larga como um cavalo de tração pairava sobre eles, e atrás dela dois homens grandes com capas carmesin. Guardas Lannister. ""O que você está fazendo com esse gato, menino?"" Myrcella perguntou outra vez, severa. Para seu irmão disse: ""Ele é um garoto esfarrapado, não é? Olhe para ele."" Ela deu um risinho. ""Um garoto esfarrapado fedorento,"" Tommen concordou. Eles não me conhecem, Arya se deu conta. (Tradução livre)*

Agora no livro dois, no primeiro capítulo do Tyrion, temos uma das partes mais espirituosas de toda a obra. Papo de rivalizar com Edd Doloroso. Uma pequena ilustração de como a Myrcella se portava mesmo perante o saudoso Rei Joffrey.

*Joffrey*: *Don't be childish.*  
*Myrcella*: *We're children. We're supposed to be childish.*

Joffrey: *Não seja infanil.*  
Myrcella: *Nós somos crianças. É suposto que sejamos infantis.*

É difícil ser criança, mesmo sendo perfeita e privilegiada. Você ainda não é gente. Não tem agência sobre a própria vida. Nesse momento acontece com Myrcella uma das piores coisas que poderia acontecer a uma pessoa. Ela é enviada para Dorne.

Vamos abrir um parêntese aqui para falar um pouco do Tio Tyrion e desse plot.

Eu gosto da ideia de tirar Myrcella da cidade. Se dependesse de mim (nesse momento histórico) Tommen estaria seguro no Rochedo, talvez como escudeiro de Devan; e Myrcella nas Cidades Livres, disfarçada, talvez até prometida a alguém que o Banco de Ferro sugerisse. Tywin não ter agido nessa questão foi uma espécie de respeito dele para com a Cersei que Tyrion não partilhou. Suponho.

O famigerado plano em três atos do anão foi inteligente. Não tanto quanto ele pensa, mas foi. Eu não gosto do resultado, mas ir pro Vale de Arryn com Mindinho parece quase tão ruim quanto Lança Solar. Posso fechar o parêntese sem culpar o Mão interino.

E agora já não posso culpar ou perdoar mais ninguém. O plot ainda está correndo.

Myrcella chegou em Dorne antes de mais nada para mostrar a diferença entre as casas nobres. Se a situação fosse ao contrário, Tywin teria mandado fazer com Myrcella muito pior do que foi feito com Elia.

Em Dorne a princesa é honrada como se deve, em um primeiro momento. Quentyn não era ruim, admito. E parece-me que Trystane é melhor. Com um olhar paternal acredito que os dois formavam um belo casal. Esses namoros nessa idade são saudáveis, mesmo com um dornês. No melhor dos cenários a menina já voltaria para a corte adolescente imune a vários genjustus que pegariam garotas como Sansa e Jeyne Poole. Ou até mesmo a jovem Rhaenyra.

Homem também cai em genjutsu. Quem nunca? A chave de buceta da Arianne para cima do nosso querido sor Arys foi coisa inescapável, fi. É nível Itachi. Não tem jeito. Provavelmente todo homem cairia na dela. Ainda mais pela forma galantemente trágica como terminou, eu o perdoo. Quem não faz o mesmo está de sacanagem.

Estrela Negra, porém, tem de ser punido. Esse plot também está aberto. Pode até ser que haja algo por trás disso. Mesmo assim fato é que o emo cortou a orelha da minha princesinha. Isso daí não tem volta, não. É perder a mão, ou muralha. Menos é sacanagem.

""O que pode haver por trás?"" Alguns podem estar se perguntando. Eu acredito que Dayne seja o X9 que caguetou geral para Doran.

*If I led a quarter of a million men to death, would they call me Gerold the Great? I shall remain Darkstar, I think. At least it is mine own.*

*Se eu liderar duzentos e cinquenta mil homens para a morte, irão eles me chamar de Gerald o Grande? Fico como Estrela Negra. Pelo menos é um nome só meu. (Tradução livre)*

E como diria o queijeiro, coroar Myrcella é mata-la. Mata-la é levar uma galera foda para a morte. É EXATAMENTE ISSO QUE ELES ESTÃO FAZENDO!!!!!111ONE!!11

Eu não entendo esse role do Alto Hermitério. Não confio em Doran. E a câmera que anda do Hotah não nos entrega tudo que deveria. Tem muito trem que é trem fantasma. Tem muita coisa que a Globo não mostra.

Porra, se eu já odeio Dorne agora, imagina se eu descobrir que Doran aprovou e incentivou um ataque a Myrcella para cozinhar a situação a seu modo? Podemos pensar nisso, mas agora é esperar... parece loucura, mas essa gente come peçonha.

Pelo o que sabemos Myrcella é inteligente o suficiente para saber que está em um perigo foda, por mais que não saiba o quão foda. Eu desacredito foda que mesmo antes do ferimento ela tinha comprado esse plot. Ela só foi malandra de não ir contra o que estava motivando todos ao seu redor. Parece claro para mim que a manutenção do status quo Lannister é a agenda que a princesa deseja seguir. Ela acredita que Tommen Baratheon é o legítimo rei, não ela. Só não abriu a boca. Não iria contra sua família. Nela a Arianne não pode dar chave alguma, não importa o tamanho ou a quantidade do molho.

E nesse mesmo pique Myrcella se encontra agora. Cooperando com o que pedem para ela, mesmo mutilada, na esperança de ficar segura. Uma pequena leoa fazendo cosplay de passarinho. Acredito que nesse momento mesmo o romance com Trystane já foi para o caralho na cabeça dela.

O que ela quer é Cersei. É a filha do Regicida, afinal.

Já acabou o que temos quanto a ela nos livros. Pela série podemos cravar que a Myrcella morrerá? Eu cravo, mas mais pela profecia da Cersei do que pelos planos de Doran. Mas em que momento? São muitas as questões que envolvem a neta de Lorde Tywin. Não acredito que ela chegue ao livro sete, mas será muito importante no seis.

VAMOS LOGO COM ELE, MARTIN."

O experiență frustrantă cu o comandă online la Sephora,WomenRO,1hhonb5,2024-12-19 03:45:25,44,0.89,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenRO/comments/1hhonb5/o_experiență_frustrantă_cu_o_comandă_online_la/,MissAries22,F4A advice,"Bună tuturor,

Vreau să împărtășesc o experiență frustrantă pe care am avut-o aseară cu aplicația mobilă Sephora, încercând să beneficiez de o ofertă specială de sărbători. Iată ce s-a întâmplat:

Am plasat o comandă pentru un Dyson Airwrap prin aplicația mobilă Sephora. La deschiderea aplicației, a apărut un pop-up care promova o ofertă de sărbători: o promoție pentru comenzile de peste 1500 RON folosind codul ""HOLIDAY."" Nu erau menționate alte detalii sau restricții în acel pop-up. Dacă făceai clic pe pop-up, erai direcționat către o listă de produse pe care le puteai cumpara.

Am adăugat Dyson Airwrap în coș, am aplicat voucherul, iar acesta apărea ""ACTIV"" pe tot parcursul procesului de finalizare a comenzii. Totuși, când am trecut la alegerea metodei de livrare, am observat că singura opțiune disponibilă pentru acest produs era ""pick-up magazin."" Nu existau alte opțiuni precum livrarea la domiciliu sau la easybox.

Problema a apărut în momentul în care am finalizat plata. Aplicația nu m-a avertizat că voucherul ""HOLIDAY"" va fi eliminat din cauza restricției de ridicare din magazin. Abia când am ridicat comanda din magazin am aflat că voucherul nu fusese aplicat, deoarece era valabil doar pentru comenzile cu livrare. Aceste informații esențiale lipseau complet din procesul de finalizare a comenzii. Mi-au zis fetele din magazin.

Când am mers la magazinul Sephora din Vitan Mall pentru clarificări, personalul mi-a confirmat că probabil este vorba despre o eroare de sistem și m-au direcționat către serviciul de suport clienți. Aici experiența mea s-a înrăutățit.

Am petrecut aproximativ 20 de minute la telefon cu un agent de suport clienți. Aceasta mi-a spus direct că oferta era valabilă doar pentru ""comenzile online"" (deși comanda mea a fost plasată online!) și a insistat că eu am ""ales"" opțiunea de ridicare din magazin. Totuși, aceasta era singura opțiune disponibilă pentru produs, deci nu a fost o alegere.

Am explicat că voucherul a rămas activ pe tot parcursul procesului de plasare a comenzii și că aplicația nu m-a notificat despre eliminarea lui. Ea mi-a confirmat că voucherul a fost eliminat în timpul procesării, dar nu mi-a putut explica de ce aplicația nu m-a avertizat sau de ce nu a blocat utilizarea voucherului încă de la început dacă acesta nu ar fi trebuit sa fie aplicabil pentru comanda mea.

Când am semnalat această eroare evidentă de sistem, a început să vorbească peste mine și nu a avut deloc o atitudine constructivă. Soluția ei? Mi-a spus că ar fi trebuit să aștept ca produsul să revină în stoc pentru livrare. Cum aș fi putut ști că există stocuri separate pentru diferitele metode de livrare? Ca și client, tot ce știam era că produsul era disponibil pentru comandă și am reușit să finalizez comanda.

Mai mult, și-a pierdut răbdarea cu mine, m-a întrerupt de mai multe ori (ceea ce probabil se poate verifica în înregistrarea apelului) și a încheiat conversația brusc, spunând: ""Dacă nu mai pot să vă ajut, încheiem apelul."" Nu am confirmat că problema mea a fost rezolvată, pentru că nu a fost.

În cele din urmă, m-a direcționat să trimit un email către suport (ceea ce fac acum doar ca formalitate). Totuși, întreaga experiență m-a făcut să mă simt indusă în eroare și frustrată. Promoția nu a dezvăluit informații critice de la început, iar aplicația a eșuat în a mă notifica despre eliminarea voucherului în timpul procesului de checkout. Aceste probleme sunt atât înșelătoare, cât și inacceptabile pentru o companie de renume precum Sephora.

În plus, atitudinea agentului de suport a fost neprofesionistă și neconstructivă, ceea ce mi-a dublat frustrarea. Intenționez să depun o plângere oficială la ANPC, deoarece consider că această situație reprezintă o practică înșelătoare.

Tot ce vreau este să primesc produsul promoțional la care aveam dreptul conform condițiilor ofertei de sărbători, indiferent dacă prin ridicare din magazin sau livrare. Sunt dispusă să plătesc taxa de livrare, dacă este cazul, deoarece comanda mea respecta toate celelalte condiții ale promoției.

  
Scuze de mesajul lung, dar cer o părere, dacă ați trecut prin ceva similar, sau cu cine aș mai putea lua legatura din echipa lor pentru aceasta situație. M-ar ajuta foarte mult deoarece acea oferta m-a cam facut sa plasez comanda acum și nu sa mai aștept eventuale reduceri.

Multumesc :)


Update:

Spre marea mea surprindere, am fost contactata de cineva in echipa Sephora pentru a-mi trimite cutia cadou, free of charge. 

De aceasta data, s-a vorbit foarte frumos si politicos, mentionand ca au fost contactati avocatii lor de catre ANPC, si ca i-ar ajuta enorm de mult daca mi-as retrage plangerea, lucru pe care nu m-am decis daca o sa il fac.

Multumesc din nou pentru sfaturi, it was a ride!"
Another Theory: LiDAR mapping operated by foreign entity,UFOs_Archives,1hgruui,2024-12-17 21:43:57,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs_Archives/comments/1hgruui/another_theory_lidar_mapping_operated_by_foreign/,SaltyAdminBot,,"**Another Crazy one:**  
  
I was just wondering like you guys what these things are, and if we agree that they are drones, and if we extrapolate that they are foreign, I think they could be some RECON devices equipped with LiDAR, mapping the enemy territory to prepare an invasion. 

I talk about LiDAR but it could also be another mapping technic we don't know about. 

Note: The FAA lights are often a point of contention, but if I were Chinese, I would make drones with FAA-approved lighting systems to confuse people. Just saying. Camouflage stuff. To make it as hard as possible for us to detect them next to our own flying devices. To confuse everybody, and it works, we are confused.

**Couple of stuff I found about LiDAR:**  
  
LiDAR, or light detection and ranging, is used by the military for a variety of defense applications, including:

* **Battlefield mapping**: LiDAR is used to create detailed 3D maps of battlefields. 
* **Mine countermeasures**: LiDAR-based systems can locate floating and moored mines. 
* **Line of sight determination**: LiDAR can help determine line of sight. 
* **Autonomous navigation**: LiDAR can help military vehicles navigate autonomously. 
* **Missile guidance**: Some missiles are equipped with LiDAR seekers. 

  
**Here is what GPT has to say about LiDAR's laser:**

*Typically, the laser emitted by a LiDAR system is not visible to the naked eye. Most LiDAR systems use infrared lasers, which operate at wavelengths that are outside the visible spectrum. This means you wouldn’t see the laser beams themselves.*

*However, if the laser is powerful enough, it could cause* ***a visible glow*** *if it reflects off a surface and is concentrated in a certain way, but this is rare and not typical in most LiDAR applications. The laser’s infrared light is designed to be invisible, which is why LiDAR is effective for sensing in both bright and dark environments without drawing attention to itself.*

I don't know guys.. What do you think?"

Am standarde de relație nerealiste?,CasualRO,1hg9745,2024-12-17 07:05:56,109,0.74,330,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualRO/comments/1hg9745/am_standarde_de_relație_nerealiste/,M2Flashy5-Rice-6671,:discutie: Discuție,"TLDR comentarii, grab some popcorn:
""îndoctrinator"", ""walking turn-off, red flag, habotnic"", ""aderi la aberațiile bisericii"", ""nu e normal sa impui cuiva ce să facă"", ""inteligență sărăcăcioasă"", ""gândire medievală"", ""judeci prea ușor persoanele"", ""pari sociopat"", ""cu descrierea asta îți iei block de la toate femeile"", ""ești rupt de l*bă"", ""tu n-ai standarde ai cerințele de supunere"", ""lumea normala la cap asociază bisericos cu libidinos, pedofil"", ""în viața reală nu s-ar da doi bani pe tine"", ""daca tot zici că ești creștin, in loc sa îți judeci viitoarea iubita că păcătuiește mai bine te rogi pentru ea"", ""cum e viața fără sex"", ""pari o persoană foarte plictisitoare"". 


Final edit: cine citește până la final merită un premiu. Constat (și doar in urma comentariilor de aici) că România în prag de 2025 e murdară de o mentalitate de trib. Din doua puncte de vedere: mai întâi e suficientă o desincronizare de obiective și poți fi ținta unor comentarii lipsite de empatie. Apoi, prin punerea de etichete: daca am spus că sunt religios și că sunt interesat de relații pe termen lung, ăsta a fost singurul lucru care a contat și am fost dezbracat de alte calități. Brusc nu a mai contat cine sunt, ce înseamnă pentru mine noțiunea de ""religios"" sau cum o aplic în viața de zi cu zi, ci mi s-au atribuit toate stereotipurile care se asociază cu biserica (aveți rubrică Best of la inceputul postării). Puțin ironic că gândirea mea medievală m-a învățat compasiunea, dar în 2025 nici gândirea asta nici compasiunea necondiționată nu mai sunt la modă. Ăsta nu e un mesaj de reproș, e doar o constatare a ce s-a întâmplat și văd cu amărăciune că poți fi un om decent, să nu jignești și să fii în banca ta și tot îți vei atrage comentarii negative fiind credincios. Cred că număr pe degete comentariile care chiar au dat un răspuns întrebării mele ""am standarde nerealiste?"", restul au presupus că sunt refuzat în relații, că sunt psihopat, urât și neîngrijit, incapabil să port o conversație, inadaptat etc. I'm speechless, dar mă mulțumește ideea că aceeași libertate care îmi permite mie sa îmi practic convingerile vă permite vouă sa le contestați. N-ar fi corect să mă leg doar de comentariile negative, cu ocazia asta va mulțumesc tuturor celor care ați aruncat o vorbă bună ori în chat ori in comentarii, va apreciez pe toți. Și dacă rezonați cu ce am scris eu aici, nu uitați că nu sunteți singuri! ❤️


Postarea originală ↓
Salut, un M25 aici recent pus pe gânduri că am standarde nerealiste in ceea ce privește o relație. De obicei nu îmi plac descrierile, dar de data asta sunt necesare că trebuie context: sunt absolvent de facultate cu licență și master, de câțiva ani intrat pe piața muncii. Am schimbat câteva joburi in timpul masterului (pe publicitate și geologie, un pic de voluntariat etc) iar de actualul 9 to 5 sunt relativ mulțumit. Nu fumez și nu beau, nu merg in cluburi și nu ascult manele (no judgement pentru cine ascultă), nu sunt interesat de hookup culture etc. Încerc să mă mențin în formă fizică bună, nu mă dau înapoi de la o conversație, îmi plac drumețiile și mai nou sculptatul in lemn, plănuiesc să învăț să cânt la un instrument, mă preocupă mâncatul sănătos și gătitul acasă, I date to marry și sunt creștin de ăla bisericos. Astea sunt lucruri pe care le caut și eu la o persoană, dar când le pui la un loc, pare că opțiunile mele dispar. Am avut câteva încercări de relații în ultimii ani și am și experiență cu dating apps, dar nimic ce sa se solidifice. Ce părere aveți? 



Edit: cumva am primit răspunsul, păreri puternice. Sunt păreri puternice. Dar le înțeleg, in special daca ați avut experiențe urâte anterior cu cineva care spune că e din cercul bisericii. Pentru inceput, nu vă gândiți că sunt un wannabe preacher pentru tot ce auziți în media că face biserica. E vorba doar că la sfârșit de săptămână o duminică la biserică îmi aduce liniște și as vrea lângă mine pe cineva care să împărtășească obiceiul ăsta. Nu sunt protestant, sunt de 2-3 ani ortodox mai serios, deci nu am fost de mic religios. Mai important, nu am intenția să convertesc pe nimeni, de asta ar fi interesat de cineva care deja are obiceiul/ dorința asta. 

O greșeală pe care am făcut-o a fost să folosesc expresia ""dating to marry"", pe care nu cred că o înțeleg îndeajuns. Nu e vorba de judging aici pentru cei care nu sunt credincioși/ nu au aceeași intenție. Încercăm să zic că intențiile mele sunt serioase (daca apare o problemă o rezolvam, I will not cheat etc), nu că salivez la fiecare nouă fată pe care o întâlnesc ca și cum ea ar fi aleasa. Promit că nu sunt așa rigid precum am făcut să sune mesajul, am incercat doar sa includ cat mai multă informație într-un mesaj cât mai scurt.

Alte întrebări la care ați dorit sa răspund: ""Care e aspectul tau fizic și cum te îmbraci fiindcă mai contează și asta"" - am 1.83m, 72 kg. Legat de vestimentație, încerc să mă îmbrac acceptabil (acum că e iarnă un pulover, blugi negri, cizme, ± palton depinde de vreme). Nu foarte urât dar nici cât să ies in evidență. 

""Ce cauți pe dating apps dacă ești credincios?"" nu e neapărat ceva ce ce am dorit, doar mi-a fost sugerat iar acum pot spune că am încercat și varianta asta.

Atât momentan, dar mai pot răspunde la întrebări. Nu mă așteptam in schimb doar fiindcă am pomenit biserica sa stârnesc așa o reacție =))) va reamintesc că nu e in intenția mea sa jignesc, convertesc sau să judec pe nimeni. Nici nu mă consider mai presus decât alții, de asta titlul postării mele e daca e ceva in neregulă cu standardele mele și dacă pot schimba ceva.

# DEC. 16th 2024~Critical minerals outlook: M&A to ramp up in 2025

[Critical minerals outlook: M&A to ramp up](https://www.allens.com.au/insights-news/insights/2024/11/critical-minerals-outlook-ma-to-ramp-up/)

  
***2024 was a turbulent year for dealmakers, project developers and investors in critical minerals. New supply outpacing short-term demand growth in immature markets led to declining prices, affecting financing availability and dealmaking activity.***

https://preview.redd.it/4n757qupd77e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4e684726d73ee1c047887f6634f3e2a4b30e21d

However, we see reasons for optimism in the coming year. Recent large-scale M&A activity shows that—while there may be oversupply of certain critical minerals in today's market—long-term demand is growing in line with the expansion of clean energy technologies and the global energy transition.

Moreover, we expect to see increasing competition for ownership and control of assets and associated infrastructure as governments around the world increasingly look to inject themselves (and their capital) into securing and investing in critical minerals supply chains. Specifically, we have seen state government and federal government financial support for Australian-based critical mineral companies including the recently announced funding package for Illuka's flagship Eneabba rare earths refinery project.  

In this *Insight*, we'll look back at the trends in critical minerals from 2024 and explain what to expect in 2025.

[GOOD READ WITH COFFEE....](https://preview.redd.it/bfvqq2dfe77e1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=300996e0a3dbef70709f670631c31554bc14e77c)

# Developers will increasingly rely on creative financing strategies to get deals done

Traditional greenfield project financing has been challenging for critical minerals developers amid softer commodity prices. This has opened the door to other, alternative sources of funding from government and offtakers to supplement traditional project financing from banks. We expect developers to continue to look for more creative ways to finance projects.

Over the last few years we've seen an increased role for government lenders to provide support during the initial phases of development and ramp up. Similarly, customers focused on securing long-term supply are putting their hands into their pockets to assist with the startup funding. Customer finance can come in a variety of forms; from pure debt to offtake prepayments and convertible note structures. Ultimatley, given customer lenders want the product rather than straight repayment of the debt, they can apply a different credit lens, thereby removing some of the obstacles to a traditional project financing. Such financing arrangements also offer a short-term solution that we expect will only increase in 2025 as producers seek to diversify their capital stacks.

That said, with interest rates expected to fall, we still expect that major domestic and international lenders will be critical to the debt financing of critical minerals projects—particularly later in the lifecycle of the projects that are operational. Many banks are still bullish on critical minerals, and we expect they will be eager to put their balance sheets to work to finance the energy transition as prices recover.

# DEC. 14th, 2024~Dark Eagle: US bares hypersonic claws at China, Russia

  
[Dark Eagle: US bares hypersonic claws at China, Russia - Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2024/12/dark-eagle-us-bears-hypersonic-claws-at-china-russia/)

[In this photo provided by the United States Department of Defense on December 12, 2024, the US Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon system fires a conventional hypersonic missile from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The Pentagon said it was a successful \\""end-to-end\\"" flight test. Image: US DOD](https://preview.redd.it/25t100b4e97e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c8f4cbf61e37b40ff89ee22dc74a930cc437d4)

With a thunderous launch, the US Army’s Dark Eagle hypersonic missile has just blazed past years of delays, signaling a bold new surge in America’s race for long-range precision firepower against China and Russia.

This month, The War Zone [reported](https://www.twz.com/land/army-dark-eagle-hypersonic-missile-finally-blasts-out-of-its-launcher) that the US Army successfully test-fired its Dark Eagle hypersonic missile from a trailer-based launcher at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The test marks a significant milestone after years of delays due to launcher issues.

  
The test, conducted by the US Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) and the US Navy Strategic Systems Programs, involved the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), also known as the common All Up Round (AUR) missile.

The report notes that the missile, which the US Navy plans to deploy on Zumwalt-class destroyers and Block V Virginia-class submarines, achieved hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 5.

The War Zone says that various aircraft, including NASA’s WB-57F and the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) HALO jets, observed the test, demonstrating the missile’s capability to reach target distances at hypersonic speeds.

  
***ARTICLE SHORTENED A BIT...  \*\*\*NOTE THE FOLLOWING!***

# However, a US Congressional Research Service (CRS) [report](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25430526/r45811-7.pdf) this month mentions several critical challenges for the US in developing, producing, testing and deploying hypersonic weapons.

# *****According to the report, one significant hurdle is technological complexity as hypersonic systems require cutting-edge materials that can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. Manufacturing these advanced materials at scale poses production bottlenecks.

# The CRS report states that the precision required for aerodynamic shaping and integrating guidance, navigation and control systems represent further complications

[Materials Design for Hypersonics (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04053.pdf)

***3.1. Metallic Materials for Hypersonics Metallic materials are ubiquitously used in hypersonic vehicles – as nose and wing leading edges, control surfaces, and engine inlets – due to their tendency to their damage tolerance and manufacturability. These components need to withstand extremely high heat fluxes and thermal strains, which demand materials with high melting points that maintain strength at high temperatures. Pure elements with high melting points (W, Re, Ta, Mo, Nb, V, Cr, Ti, Ni) form the basis of fielded high temperature alloys. For instance, Ti was employed in hot aeroshell structures in the SR-71 \[5, 15\] the nose section of the X-43 contained a SD 180 tungsten heavy alloy \[51\], a Haynes Ni-base alloy was used in the Mach 7 X-43 variant \[52\], and both MoRe and Ni-base alloys have been tested for heat pipe structures \[11\]. Other refractory metals, such as the TaWHf alloys T111 and T222 (see Box 1) exhibit favorable creep-resistant materials properties and are ideal for the extended containment of heated liquid alkali-metal working fluids (1000-1300°C) for heat pipe type leading edge designs \[53\].***

# T111/Li and Niobium based C-103/Na designs have been assessed to satisfy the requirements for Mach 8 and Mach 10 flights respectively [24].

# Introduction

In the evolving landscape of global defense, the arms race has metamorphosed from a contest of nuclear might to one of unparalleled speed. [Hypersonic weapons](https://www.csis.org/analysis/complex-air-defense-countering-hypersonic-missile-threat) (capable of exceeding [five times the speed of sound](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/)), promise to revolutionize modern warfare.

China's strides in the hypersonic field are a manifestation of its broader strategic intentions and underscore its drive toward technological and military preeminence. This journey toward mastering hypersonic technology is not merely for show; it is about redefining the global balance of military power.

A successful deployment of these weapons would enable China to redefine the term “first-strike advantage.” Such a capability is not merely about striking first; it is about striking in a manner that leaves the opponent minimal time or capacity to react, effectively nullifying their defensive postures. This introduces a dangerous paradigm wherein the traditional cushion of time provided by early warning systems is drastically reduced. For the United States, this might mean that even with the world's most advanced detection systems, the [window to act](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45811/35) could be so minimal that it might be rendered ineffective. As the United States and China jostle for dominance in this arena, the strategic significance of an elemental material, niobium, emerges as a pivotal concern, and with it, China’s rising dominance in the Western Hemisphere’s mining sector.

# Niobium: The Aerospace Marvel

Vacuum-grade niobium’s [role](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/) in aerospace is not a newfound revelation. Its unparalleled resilience against extreme thermal stresses, withstanding temperatures [over 2,400 degrees Celsius,](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/) renders it indispensable for critical components in hypersonic vehicles. Beyond its inherent properties, niobium’s pivotal role lies in its use for crafting heat-resistant superalloys essential for hypersonic missiles and the broader aerospace sector. Its low density compared to other refractory metals contributes to a [high strength-to-weight ratio](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/), which is essential for reducing the weight of aerospace components. This reduction in weight directly impacts fuel efficiency and payload capacity, two critical factors in aerospace design. For example, companies like [SpaceX and Hermeus](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/) depend on niobium C103 for their spacecrafts, which require extremely high temperatures that surpass that of other superalloys.

For decades, niobium has played a pivotal role in the U.S. aerospace industry, with its notable use in the innovative designs of the iconic [Gemini and Apollo](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apollo-15-CSM-in-lunar-orbit-with-the-dark-rocket-nozzle-made-from-niobium-titanium_fig1_329104474) programs of the 1960s and 70s. However, despite its significance, the United States depends entirely on niobium imports, with no substantial domestic mining since [1959](https://minedocs.com/19/USGS-Mineral-Commodity-Summaries-Niobium-January-2022.pdf). This reliance introduces a severe risk to its supply chain. Of the estimated [8,800 metric tons](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/) imported annually in 2022, a significant majority comes from [Brazil (66 percent) and Canada (25 percent)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/). This heavy reliance on just two primary sources—both neighbors of the United States in the Western Hemisphere—exposes the United States to considerable national security and economic vulnerabilities. The situation becomes even more precarious considering China’s dominant position in the niobium sector and its growing footprint in the hemisphere.

China’s Stake in Brazil’s Mineral Monopoly

Brazil dominated global niobium production in 2020, accounting for over [91 percent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316) of production. With reserves estimated at [842 million metric tons](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/), Brazil produces roughly [120,000 metric tons annually](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/). Brazil’s high production comes from large mines such as [Araxá and Catalão](https://www.cradleresources.com.au/what-is-niobium/), with Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração (CBMM) controlling [75 percent of Brazil’s output](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/).

China has recognized the potential of niobium for over a decade. In 2011, a consortium of [five Chinese companies](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/) acquired a 15 percent stake in CBMM. This engagement intensified in 2016 when China Molybdenum Co. Ltd. (now known only as CMOC) secured ownership of the [Chapadão and Boa Vista mines](https://dialogochino.net/en/extractive-industries/25588-niobiums-silent-impact-in-brazil/), further strengthening China's position in the niobium market.

The importance of niobium was further highlighted in the Brazilian political arena in 2018. Then presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro emphasized niobium's role in Brazil's “[economic independence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-china-niobium/hands-off-brazils-niobium-bolsonaro-sees-china-as-threat-to-utopian-vision-idUSKCN1MZ1JN/).” Despite Bolsonaro's campaign rhetoric focusing on safeguarding this critical commodity from foreign control and advocating for its national governance, Chinese influence in the Brazilian niobium sector continued to grow. By 2020, Chinese entities controlled approximately [26 percent of Brazil's niobium production](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316). This control not only ensures China's preferential access and influence over pricing dynamics in the niobium supply chain, but also positions it advantageously in a global context.

China managed to maintain and even strengthen its position at the subnational level under Bolsonaro. CMOC for instance provided [$1.2 million](https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/04/brazils-economic-ties-china-flourish-despite-political-shifts) in Covid-19 aid to the city of Catalão, demonstrating China's strategic engagement beyond mere commercial interests.

China’s influence over Brazil’s niobium production conforms to a [pattern](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2023/07/chinas-critical-mineral-model-latin-america/) of growing ownership and sway over the regional mining industry, a trend with substantial environmental, political, and security implications. Such tactics could force nations into making diplomatic compromises, ceding trade advantages, or grappling with economic dilemmas, thereby solidifying China's geopolitical standing. The United States is not immune to this exposure; in 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey identified niobium as the [second most critical of 50 minerals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316#bib0072), falling behind only gallium in its criticality to U.S. national security and economic growth.

# Defense Implications

China's hypersonic resolve has been remarkable. By 2018, it had [conducted over 20 times](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf) as many tests as the United States. According to the Pentagon, the United States is [still lagging.](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2023/04/18/pentagon-yes-we-are-still-lagging-behind-chinas-hypersonics/) This hypersonic prowess, combined with China's stranglehold on niobium, places the United States in a perilous position.

The strategic importance of niobium in next-generation defense systems cannot be overstated. As the U.S. military and its defense contractors increasingly rely on niobium-based superalloys to produce a wide range of equipment, from aircraft components to hypersonic missile systems, any disruption in the niobium supply chain could have significant repercussions.

Overall, China's growing influence and control over critical mineral supply chains poses a distinct challenge. Under the Biden administration, the United States and the European Union placed export controls and restrictions on strategic and critical minerals to curb China’s dominance in [artificial intelligence and semiconductors](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/what-to-make-of-chinas-latest-restrictions-on-critical-mineral-exports/). In retaliation, China imposed their own limitations on [gallium, germanium](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-flexes-critical-metals-muscles-with-export-curbs-2023-07-10/), and [graphite](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/) throughout 2023. A recent analysis by [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions#:~:text=China%20produces%2090%20percent%20of,90%20percent%20of%20global%20graphite.) highlighted that China controls 90 percent of global gallium supplies, 90 percent of graphite, and 60 percent of germanium, all critical to the production of chips and electric vehicle batteries. The critical mineral supply chain has arrived at the forefront of strategic competition between the West and the People’s Republic of China.

China’s grip on the production, distribution, and pricing of niobium presents another layer of complexity: manipulating niobium’s availability to other nations. For the United States, already grappling with the challenges of overdependence on external sources for critical minerals, such a disruption could translate into significant production delays. The consequences could be serious: slower production of critical defense equipment, increased costs due to the potential need for alternative materials, and a cascading effect on existing machinery's maintenance and upgrade cycles. In this highly complex environment where timely responses to emerging threats are vital, these delays could hinder the United States' ability to promptly deploy or develop necessary defense systems.

# U.S. Countermeasures

Facing such formidable challenges, the United States cannot afford to remain a passive observer. Safeguarding its strategic interests and maintaining its global position demands a comprehensive and multifaceted critical mineral strategy, particularly in securing niobium supplies.

# Including Brazil in the MSP

Incorporating Brazil into the 13-nation [Mineral Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/) (MSP) could significantly fortify the global niobium supply chain. The MSP represents a concerted multinational endeavor to develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and bolster investments in critical mineral supply chains, an initiative that aligns well with the strategic interests of both Brazil and the broader international community. Brazil’s inclusion would make it the first Latin American country to enter the partnership, signaling its regional leadership and increase in international stature. The integration of Brazil into this partnership is particularly strategic, considering its substantial niobium reserves, in addition to its other critical mineral deposits. This move would add a robust layer of security against potential supply disruptions.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, with its strong emphasis on ESG standards, is likely to find the MSP's principles congruent with its [policy priorities](https://dialogochino.net/en/climate-energy/363907-will-lula-be-brazils-environmental-saviour/). The MSP’s emphasis on elevating global standards in these areas could resonate with Lula’s progressive agenda, potentially making Brazil’s participation both beneficial and attractive.

Furthermore, Brazil's inclusion in the MSP would facilitate its adherence to a framework that advocates for the diversification and stabilization of mineral supply chains. This alignment could be instrumental in mitigating China’s dominant influence in the niobium market. By joining the MSP, Brazil would not only assert its role in the global mineral economy but also contribute to a more balanced and less vulnerable critical mineral supply landscape, including niobium.

# Diversification of Niobium Sources

# Diversifying niobium sources is a critical strategic concern. The current overreliance on a limited number of suppliers presents a significant vulnerability in the supply chain. This is not merely a matter of economic convenience but a pressing national security issue. The [Elk Creek project](https://www.usgs.gov/data/niobium-deposits-united-states) in Nebraska represents a commendable step toward addressing this vulnerability domestically. This initiative exemplifies how investment in local resources can contribute to a more resilient supply chain. Placing more emphasis on domestic production, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act [calls for domestic manufacturing of critical minerals](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/whats-in-the-fy2024-ndaa-for-critical-minerals/), and “encourages DOD to review the need to utilize Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic processing capacity of niobium, tantalum, and scandium.”

# However, to comprehensively mitigate the risks associated with niobium supply, the United States should extend its strategy beyond domestic projects. Engaging in international partnerships, especially with Canadian, African, and European nations that have niobium reserves, is crucial.

# Canada’s significant niobium reserves stands as an ideal partner to strengthen North American supply security. The geographical proximity of Canada to the United States offers logistical advantages, reducing transportation costs and environmental impact. Additionally, the strong political and economic ties between the United States and Canada could facilitate smoother bilateral agreements and joint ventures in niobium exploration and development.

# Africa’s rich mineral resources, and Europe’s advanced mining technologies and regulatory frameworks, offer promising avenues for collaboration. These partnerships could lead to the exploration and development of new niobium sources, thus diversifying the global supply chain.

# Stockpiling and Strategic Reserves

The practice of stockpiling and maintaining strategic reserves of strategic minerals serves as a crucial safeguard during times of geopolitical unrest or supply chain interruptions. Experts suggest that with its existing reserves of critical minerals, the United States may [face challenges in sustaining](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/) a protracted conflict with China. The National Defense Stockpile (NDS), designed to support the nation's needs for up to [four years](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), is perceived by some as insufficient for the United States to execute its strategic military objectives effectively. Proactive measures to accumulate substantial reserves of niobium and other strategic minerals are imperative. While in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 Congress appropriated [$218.5 million](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833) for total NDS acquisitions, it remains at an unsatisfactory level to support the nation’s needs. Congress should place more effort in supporting the NDS in the future. Strategic stockpiling must be revitalized to Cold War-era levels so that the United States maintains its capability to meet both economic and defense production demands, even under challenging global scenarios.

# Conclusion

In the grand chessboard of defense geopolitics, niobium has emerged as a piece of paramount importance. The intertwining of mineral control and technological advancements underscores the multifaceted nature of modern security threats. For the United States, addressing this dual challenge is not just about catching up in the hypersonic race or diversifying niobium sources, but about reimagining its strategic approach in a complex global landscape—one where the Western Hemisphere takes center stage. Recognizing and mitigating these vulnerabilities will be crucial in ensuring U.S. national security in the face of strategic competition. The stakes are high, and the game is evolving; proactive measures today will dictate the balance of power tomorrow.

# [Mine-to-Magnet Workshop (ndia.org)](https://www.ndia.org/events/2024/1/16/mine-to-magnet)

https://preview.redd.it/uopwg6ksh97e1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7939f0494a5ca89d79fdb257c8ea1fd2e3f88a1

  
**The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) supply chains for rare earth element (REE) magnets are in a transition phase.  Supported  by U.S. and partner nations, new sources of supply from raw materials to magnets are being developed around the globe.  By statute, effective January 1, 2026, restrictions on REE magnets will follow the supply chain to the mining tier.  Additionally, as early as June 2025, suppliers may be required to provide the full provenance of all REE magnets.** 

**This day and a half workshop will gather stakeholders from across the supply chain and U.S. Government to discuss challenges and opportunities in this critical supply chain.  A partnership between Government and companies within the DIB is required to accomplish changes in REE supply chains.  The provenance requirements for REE magnets will be a significant challenge, and new technologies and new approaches to organizing the market will be required to accomplish this requirement.  The Workshop will focus on the following topics and questions:**

* *What actions is the U.S. Government taking to incentivize new sources of supply throughout the supply chain?*
* *What tiers of the supply chain are highest risk for not being fully established prior to the sourcing restriction implementation deadline?*
* *What solutions would enable supply chain provenance to the mining level, and can these solutions be implemented by the June 23rd, 2025 provenance target date?*
* *What is the status of Government and Industry efforts to develop substitute magnets and new technologies?*
* *What additional support does the nascent U.S. and friendly nation rare earth element industry need to grow and thrive in the long-term?*

**Additional InformationRecently proposed Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplemental (DFARS) sourcing requirements (DFARS Case 2021-D015) have set a deadline of January 1st, 2026 for the entire DIB REE magnet supply chains, from mining to magnet production, to be produced outside of the covered countries of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), the Russian Federation, the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.** 

**Additionally, Section 857 of James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23 NDAA) (Public Law 117-263, signed December 23, 2022) contains provisions requiring disclosure by defense contractors of the sources of supply for rare earth elements (REE) and strategic and critical materials (SCM) within permanent magnets used in defense systems.**  

**\*\*\*\*\*\*These provenance sourcing requirements will go into effect as early as June 23, 2025.  As the Department of Defense\*\*\[1\], Department of Commerce\[2\], and Department of Energy\[3\]\*\* and other government agencies have previously written, the PRC is the dominate global producer for all-tiers off the REE magnet supply chain.  Therefore, the DIB migrating to REE supply chains entirely separate from the PRC is less than straightforward.**

# DEC. 5th 2024~US scrambling to close hypersonic airpower gap with China

[US scrambling to close hypersonic airpower gap with China - Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2024/12/us-scrambling-to-close-hypersonic-airpower-gap-with-china/)

[The US Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Image: X Screengrab](https://preview.redd.it/xqjzcuo0j97e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1ad0e9a4d2f3f631863f35c62634945cd6db565)

A top US general has advocated for faster and greater production of the next-generation B-21 Raider bomber, a call to match China’s rapid airpower advancements and respond to fast-evolving threats. But an emerging hypersonic weapons gap may be shifting Asia’s airpower balance in China’s favor.

This month, FlightGlobal [reported](https://mitchellaerospacepower.org/event/an-gen-thomas-a-bussiere/) that US Air Force General Thomas Bussiere, commander of the Global Strike Command, has called for a reassessment of the planned fleet size of [Northrop Grumman](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOC/)\-made B-21 Raider bombers.

Speaking at the [Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies](https://mitchellaerospacepower.org/event/an-gen-thomas-a-bussiere/), Bussiere emphasized the critical role of the B-21 scheduled to replace the aging [Boeing](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BA/) B-1B and Northrop B-2 bombers. Bussiere described the B-21 as “the most exquisite weapons system ever built.” It is currently undergoing flight testing, with initial operational deployment expected in the mid-2020s.

The USAF’s current plan is to acquire 100 B-21s, but Bussiere suggests that this number may need to be increased to meet the demands of modern warfare and rising geopolitical challenges. He highlighted strong demand for the USAF’s bomber fleet, which includes the upgraded B-52J, noting their frequent deployment for combat operations and strategic deterrence.

Bussiere also pointed out that previous assessments indicated a need for 220 bombers, which may require revision in light of current security dynamics.

However, B-21 production challenges have resulted in a scaling down of the planned numbers of next-generation bombers, forcing the US to keep older bombers in service longer than originally scheduled.

In July 2024, Asia Times [reported](https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/us-boosts-b-2-bombers-amid-b-21-production-delays/) that the US Air Force had upgraded its B-2 Spirit stealth bombers with advanced software, enhancing their combat readiness amid delays in B-21 production.

The new open missions systems (OMS) software, developed in collaboration with the Air Force Global Strike Command and the B-2 Systems Program Office, significantly reduces update times from two years to less than three months, allowing for quicker integration of new weapons and continuous improvements.

***Article shortened....***

The ARRW, a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle (HGV), is designed to counter heavily defended, high-value targets but has faced repeated testing failures, leading to delays and budget cuts. The US Senate and House of Representatives eliminated $150 million requested for its continued development in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act.

Despite these setbacks, the program continues with planned flight tests, driven by rising concerns over China’s hypersonic capabilities. The US Air Force is also exploring air-breathing hypersonic weapons, such as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC), which may offer more cost-effective and versatile solutions but have yet to be proven.

I'm never going to be her paid caregiver,CaregiverSupport,1hcv5bi,2024-12-12 15:56:25,42,0.96,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1hcv5bi/im_never_going_to_be_her_paid_caregiver/,Billymays76,Venting,"I called Medicaid and finally, the DAR form I sent them was approved. I thought I can finally be grandma's paid caregiver but no. Area Agency on Aging is in charge of that. I told them that I thought Medicaid would be the one paying me, but apparently not. I've dealt with Area Agency on Aging before and I hate them. Putting grandma who was physically disabled, and battling a horrific bout of delirium, at the bottom of the fucking waiting list. Multiple times.

When we were approved by Medicaid to be grandma's insurance, our social worker told us to call Area Agency so that we can let Medicaid handle it for us but we couldn't. So much back and forth for MONTHS!

Finally, after months the DAR form was approved. But I still can't be paid. Area Agency has the assessments and the waiting lists, we've had several god damn assessments and they amounted to nothing. I can't keep waiting weeks for a fucking reassessment only to be told that she's at the bottom of the fucking list.

And you know what? The lady told me that it's a caregiver subsidy and that I BARELY would be paid. She literally fucking told me that it barely would even cover the groceries, THE FUCKING GROCERIES!!

So what was the point? Even if I get accepted, the god damn food stamps we have would cover the groceries more.

I remember that i would keep thinking my situation would get better if I was just getting paid. That is the only thing that brought relief to me AND NOW ITS NEVER GONNA FUCKING COME TRUE!! Everytime I would have a panic attack, and cry my fucking eyes out, the thought of me finally being paid genuinely brought relief. But look now.

I have to deal with yelling, panic attacks, crying, cleaning, breaking my fucking back, AND IM NOT EVEN GONNA GET PAID A FUCKING PENNY!!!

Jesus christ, everywhere I went, everywhere I searched, they said I could be a full time paid caregiver. Made it sound so sweet, but it was bullshit. We live in Florida, she's a veteran's widow, we have Medicaid, champva, humana, and we still can't have this? The doctors we see are surprised that I'm not being paid. The nurses and physical therapists that come home, they're surprised that I'm not making a god damn penny and they always say how I should be.

What the fuck am I supposed to tell grandma now? She feels guilty about all this, that I need to take care of her. She always wants to offer me money, but it wouldn't even be mine. I wanted the fucking government to pay me.

This is such fucking bullshit. All those months of crying, being so fucking angry that I can't make a dime off of this. I can't drive, the car in our driveway is fucked, I can't trust anyone to look after grandma for a full 9-5 even if I wanted to.

Being a paid caregiver literally would've made my situation better. Because it would mean I'm getting fucking paid, but no.

I'm done. I'm done fighting for it. I know damn well ChampVA won't pay me for taking care of my GREAT grandma who's a veteran's WIDOW. Fucking bullshit, I'm done. I'm only thankful we have things like food stamps and Medicaid, but compensation seems like it'll never be possible.

I do have a hobby, on the internet. I've gotten money from it before, a couple hundred bucks one time. I know that If I apply myself fully to it, I could potentially make a lot of money. Besides that, I'm gonna look up jobs that i can work from home. Even though I only have a high school diploma and no skills or experience at all. And I have a beat up ass laptop that I don't even trust to run an app.


I'm gonna try to make the most of my situation, but I'm fucking done. I did not deserve the year+ of all this stress and anxiety because I can't fucking work.

So cruel, this is so fucking cruel. I'm done. Of course I'll always be taking care of grandma, to the best of my ability, but I'm fucking done with this. At least it's something I won't have to worry about anymore. At least I won't be told multiple different things, by incompetent fucking people, being on hold with the most garbage ass music for 40 minutes, being told the most complicated things. I won't have to do it anymore because I'm fucking done. I'll figure something out. Fuck them, fuck these agencies, these companies, fuck all of them. I'm done."
Mining for Success: The Promising Futures of Element79 and Galloper Gold,pennystocks,1hbysmg,2024-12-11 12:26:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hbysmg/mining_for_success_the_promising_futures_of/,Temporary_Noise_4014,:DDNerd: 🄳🄳 :DDNerd:,"For those who have been living under a rock. To a short-term gain of USD and up to USD in a few years. It's not a sure thing, but it looks more than possible. A bunch of folks shouted silver and quickly regretted it as investors unleashed large buy orders and crushed the shorts.  
That's strength. Physical or certs are acceptable for long-term buying from one of the big solid companies. The problem is liquidity. Stocks as gold proxies can be bought and sold practically the order entered.  


**Number One**  
 Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE: ELEM) (FSE: 7YS0) (OTC: ELMGF) (""Element79"" or the ""Company"") is a mining company focused on exploring and developing its past-producing, high-grade gold and silver mine, the Lucero Project. This project is strategically located in Arequipa, Peru, a region known for its rich mineral deposits, with the intent to restart production in the near term.  
**Who We Are**  
Element79 Gold is a near-term cash-flow mining company focused on gold, silver, and associated metals. It is committed to maximizing shareholder value through responsible mining practices and sustainable project development.  
Our flagship project, Lucero, is a previously produced high-grade gold mine. It is permitted for 350 tpd of ore extraction and has the immediate-term potential to generate revenue, and we are currently working to bring it back into production in 2024 and beyond. The Lucero Project holds significant promise, and we are optimistic about its potential to yield substantial returns.  


**Key Assets**  
Element79 Gold's flagship property is a cash-flow generator. The Lucero Mine is permitted for 350 tpd, and we are working to bring this high-grade gold mine back into production in 2024.  
The company also owns notable exploration assets along the Battle Mountain trend in Nevada, Clover, which will be explored and drilled with the intent to generate resource value (Website). Another Corporate asset is the amount of relevant verbiage released to keep investors in the know.  


**Corporate Presentation**  
Investors are entreated to trust that the very experienced management can bring Lucero back into play. Why? Even though the shares have weakened, an excellent volume of trading has appeared, indicating a strong interest in the company's stock.  
Four hundred fifty-five underground channel samples have been collected from this latest phase, representing nearly 600 kg (620kg) of mineralization and 650 kg of wall rock, which underwent comprehensive analysis by our partners at Ore Discovery and unveiled significant exploration potential. Notably, results in 115 samples returned substantial values in gold (Au) (ranging from 1.0 g/t to 98.1 g/t), silver (Ag) (ranging from 0.7 g/t to 3,026 g/t), lead (Pb) (as high as 2.0%) and zinc (Zn) (up to 3.5%), highlighting the robust potential of Lucero's mineral endowment.  
A place in your long-term, junior gold sector of your portfolio. I own some. I am looking for the APR telling me Lucero is in serious production. And the gold price has exceeded USD.  


**Number Two**  
Galloper Gold Corp. (CSE: BOOM; OTC: GGDCF; Frankfurt: W9F) (the “Company” or “Galloper”) is an intriguing stock with some exciting properties, including Glover Island in Western Newfoundland.  


Galloper’s land, covering 133 sq. km, is considered highly prospective for structurally controlled orogenic gold deposits, as well as copper-gold-rich VMS deposits. Galloper is the dominant landowner on Glover Island, essentially creating 'our island on an island' with exceptional discovery potential. This unique position sets us apart and adds an element of intrigue to our investment proposition.

  
**Salient Points**  
· Galloper Gold is focused on advancing its flagship Glover Island asset in western Newfoundland.  
· Glover Island is at the convergence of major fault zones, where a known historic gold resource defined by dozens of drill holes more than a decade ago exists.  
· Galloper's 133 sq km land package surrounds this historic zone, continuing along a northeast trend for 36 km, and it is a potential new large-scale gold discovery.  
Driven by a management and technical team with successful exploration and production backgrounds, and supported by capital markets expertise, Galloper's ""outside the box"" thinking helps make the company a unique player in an increasingly selective junior resource sector.  


Corporate Presentation  
The chart shows weakening and softening recently, as does ELEM above, but it likely represents a good junior gold proxy in a long-term junior portfolio. There have been some nice trading spikes over the last few weeks, indicating periods of increased trading activity and potential profit opportunities for investors.  
Mr. Hratch Jabrayan, Galloper CEO, commented: “Glover Island represents compelling new discovery opportunities well beyond the known historic deposit defined more than a dozen years ago, so we’re excited to begin the drilling phase of our work there. Most of Glover Island has never been systematically explored as evidenced by the copper anomaly we’ve uncovered on the western side of the Island. The convergence of major faults at Glover Island and the widespread presence of ‘the right rocks’ is an excellent recipe for a potential large-scale system consistent with what has been observed elsewhere in this ‘Four Corners’ region of Western Newfoundland.”  


Galloper's other property is Mint Pond.  
Galloper's other property, Mint Pond, holds the potential to emerge as a significant new grassroots gold and/or base metals discovery following Galloper's 2022-2023 work programs. The property, never previously explored, has shown promising signs with initial soil sampling revealing anomalous gold and copper values in clusters, a result that was highly encouraging when combined with data from Galloper's LiDAR Survey and regional magnetic surveys  
Galloper boasts an impressive team with decades of business and broad mining experience.

**Who We Are**

Element79 Gold is a near-term cash-flow mining company focused on gold, silver, and associated metals. It is committed to maximizing shareholder value through responsible mining practices and sustainable project development.

Our flagship project, Lucero, is a previously produced high-grade gold mine.

Four hundred fifty-five underground channel samples have been collected from this latest phase, representing nearly 600 kg (620kg) of mineralization and 650 kg of wall rock, which underwent comprehensive analysis by our partners at Ore Discovery and unveiled significant exploration potential. Notably, results in 115 samples returned substantial values in gold (Au) (ranging from 1.0 g/t to 98.1 g/t), silver (Ag) (ranging from 0.7 g/t to 3,026 g/t), lead (Pb) (as high as 2.0%) and zinc (Zn) (up to 3.5%), highlighting the robust potential of Lucero's mineral endowment.

*Galloper’s land, covering 133 sq. km, is considered highly prospective for structurally controlled orogenic gold deposits, as well as copper-gold-rich VMS deposits. Galloper is the dominant landowner on Glover Island, essentially creating 'our island on an island' with exceptional discovery potential. This unique position sets us apart and adds an element of intrigue to our investment proposition.*

**Salient Points**

·  **Galloper Gold is focused on advancing its flagship Glover Island asset in western Newfoundland.**

·  **Glover Island is at the convergence of major fault zones, where a known historic gold resource defined by dozens of drill holes more than a decade ago exists.**

·  **Galloper's 133 sq km land package surrounds this historic zone, continuing along a northeast trend for 36 km, and it is a potential new large-scale gold discovery.**

**Driven by a management and technical team with successful exploration and production backgrounds, and supported by capital markets expertise, Galloper's ""outside the box"" thinking helps make the company a unique player in an increasingly selective junior resource sector.**

Mr. Hratch Jabrayan, Galloper CEO, commented: *“Glover Island represents compelling new discovery opportunities well beyond the known historic deposit defined more than a dozen years ago, so we’re excited to begin the drilling phase of our work there. Most of Glover Island has never been systematically explored as evidenced by the copper anomaly we’ve uncovered on the western side of the Island. The convergence of major faults at Glover Island and the widespread presence of ‘the right rocks’ is an excellent recipe for a potential large-scale system consistent with what has been observed elsewhere in this ‘Four Corners’ region of Western Newfoundland.”*

Investors are entreated to trust that the very experienced management can bring Lucero back into play. Why? Even though the shares have weakened, an excellent volume of trading has appeared, indicating a strong interest in the company's stock.

Four hundred fifty-five underground channel samples have been collected from this latest phase, representing nearly 600 kg (620kg) of mineralization and 650 kg of wall rock, which underwent comprehensive analysis by our partners at Ore Discovery and unveiled significant exploration potential. Notably, results in 115 samples returned substantial values in gold (Au) (ranging from 1.0 g/t to 98.1 g/t), silver (Ag) (ranging from 0.7 g/t to 3,026 g/t), lead (Pb) (as high as 2.0%) and zinc (Zn) (up to 3.5%), highlighting the robust potential of Lucero's mineral endowment.

A place in your long-term, junior gold sector of your portfolio. I own some. I am looking for the APR telling me Lucero is in serious production. And the gold price has exceeded USD.

**Number Two**

**Galloper Gold Corp.** **(CSE: BOOM; OTC: GGDCF; Frankfurt: W9F) (the “Company” or “Galloper**”) is an intriguing stock with some exciting properties, including Glover Island in Western Newfoundland.

https://preview.redd.it/btbrw69y6v5e1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7253c35aa72380b29dba76c5b3bc51b5a2daf218

*Galloper’s land, covering 133 sq. km, is considered highly prospective for structurally controlled orogenic gold deposits, as well as copper-gold-rich VMS deposits. Galloper is the dominant landowner on Glover Island, essentially creating 'our island on an island' with exceptional discovery potential. This unique position sets us apart and adds an element of intrigue to our investment proposition.*

**Salient Points**

·  **Galloper Gold is focused on advancing its flagship Glover Island asset in western Newfoundland.**

·  **Glover Island is at the convergence of major fault zones, where a known historic gold resource defined by dozens of drill holes more than a decade ago exists.**

·  **Galloper's 133 sq km land package surrounds this historic zone, continuing along a northeast trend for 36 km, and it is a potential new large-scale gold discovery.**

**Driven by a management and technical team with successful exploration and production backgrounds, and supported by capital markets expertise, Galloper's ""outside the box"" thinking helps make the company a unique player in an increasingly selective junior resource sector.**

The chart shows weakening and softening recently, as does ELEM above, but it likely represents a good junior gold proxy in a long-term junior portfolio. There have been some nice trading spikes over the last few weeks, indicating periods of increased trading activity and potential profit opportunities for investors.

Mr. Hratch Jabrayan, Galloper CEO, commented: *“Glover Island represents compelling new discovery opportunities well beyond the known historic deposit defined more than a dozen years ago, so we’re excited to begin the drilling phase of our work there. Most of Glover Island has never been systematically explored as evidenced by the copper anomaly we’ve uncovered on the western side of the Island. The convergence of major faults at Glover Island and the widespread presence of ‘the right rocks’ is an excellent recipe for a potential large-scale system consistent with what has been observed elsewhere in this ‘Four Corners’ region of Western Newfoundland.”*

Galloper's other property is Mint Pond.

Galloper's other property, Mint Pond, holds the potential to emerge as a significant new grassroots gold and/or base metals discovery following Galloper's 2022-2023 work programs. The property, never previously explored, has shown promising signs with **initial soil sampling revealing anomalous gold and copper value**s in clusters, a result that was highly encouraging when combined with data from Galloper's LiDAR Survey and regional magnetic surveys

Galloper boasts an **impressive team** with decades of business and broad mining experience. The newly installed CEO, Hratch Jabrayan, brings over two decades of high-level resource sector experience to Galloper, including seven years with Dundee Precious Metals, where he significantly advanced the company's interests in Armenia and globally. This wealth of experience should instil confidence in the team's ability to lead Galloper to success.

The team at Boom is a group of seasoned mining professionals with a proven track record. Their experience and capabilities make them well-suited to bring BOOM into production. Galloper, under their leadership, is focused on mineral exploration in the Central Newfoundland Gold Belt with its Glover Island and Mint Pond properties, each prospective for gold and base metals. The Glover Island Property consists of 532 mining claims totaling 13,300 hectares while Mint Pond consists of 499 claims totaling 12,475 hectares.

Again, it seems to be a good prospect and proxy for the ring gold market shortly.As with ELEM, I eagerly anticipate the future PR as both companies ramp up production. The upcoming announcements are sure to bring exciting news and further boost investor interest."
Cei cu atașament puternic evitant: cum vă mențineți relațiile?,Men_RO,1habrml,2024-12-09 10:06:59,9,0.66,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Men_RO/comments/1habrml/cei_cu_atașament_puternic_evitant_cum_vă/,ten_miles_away,Întrebare,"Am un stil de atașament destul de evitant și știu că nu e ok pe termen lung. În sensul că recent mi-am dat seama că pe măsură ce înaintez în vârstă (am +30) s-ar putea ca acest stil să-mi joace festa deoarece opțiunile romantice se restrâng pe măsură ce trec anii. Orice femeie pe care o cunosc și de care îmi place și pe care încep să o curtez, ajunge să-mi displacă după ce îmi reușește să o cuceresc. Cele pe care nu le „obțin” rămân într-un colț al minții ca niște făpturi de neatins, iar cele care mi-au comunicat că am șanse cu ele ajung să mă lase rece.

De exemplu, luna trecută am încheiat o situație de 4-5 luni cu o fată faină dar de care a ajuns să-mi displacă (nu a făcut nimic aiurea, pur și simplu mi-a venit mie un ick). Nici eu nu înțeleg la modul rațional de ce nu mi-a mai plăcut de ea, dar cred că eram incompatibili și în plus m-a făcut să mă simt incomod când mi-a comunicat faptul că ține la mine. Acum am cunoscut pe Bumble o tipă, am discutat vreo 2 zile, era destul de deschisă și interesantă. Apoi am sunat-o și am vorbit un pic, iar la final de apel mi-am dat seama că mi s-a luat de ea și nu mai vreau s-o caut. 

Pe de altă parte, tipele cu care nu s-a materializat nimic rămân să mă preocupe, deși sunt foarte conștient că e o pierdere de timp să mă gândesc la ele. De ex am pe cineva în lista de prieteni de Fb, e într-o relație serioasă, ne știm la modul amical și știu că nu am șanse la ea. Dar în gândul meu stă mereu întrebarea „Dar ce-ar fi dacă?”

Și recunosc că mă deranjează acest lucru la mine, pentru că in the back of my mind aș vrea să găsesc o persoană cu care să clădesc o relație, dar de fiecare dată când întâlnesc pe cineva îmi zic „nu-i aia”.

Am căutat un pic prin psihologie ca să înțeleg acest comportament și cred că are legătură cu copilăria și felul în care am fost crescut. Plus că țin minte că în cercul de prieteni de la bloc era glorificată treaba aia cu fetele care „se lasă greu”. Cred că mi-a rămas întipărită chestia asta în minte.

Citisem că de obicei femeile au stil de atașament anxios (într-o relație tind să „se lipească” de partener”) iar bărbații sunt mai evitanți și vor spațiu. În cazul meu este 100% așa, dar mai este și faza aia că îmi iau ick dacă femeia se apropie prea mult și vrea afecțiune de la mine. Sunt eu ciudat, sau mai sunt bărbați care au acest comportament? Sau poate e imaturitate? Ați reușit să clădiți ceva de durată?

###CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET  
####[The Iron Aegis](https://i.imgur.com/ney6mHK.jpeg): A Strategic Overview of the Anvil of the Confederation         
#####*For your eyes only*   

> The Security Treaty Operations Integrated Command Structure (STOICS) faces several key challenges on account of the UNSC’s unique borders. The Confederation maintains multiple, non-contiguous centers of gravity separated both by distance and geography, in some cases in close proximity to unfriendly states. While enjoying a close defence partnership with the world’s foremost superpower under GIGAS, the UNSC’s traditional values of rugged self-reliance and self-defence continue to permeate the Confederation’s wider zeitgeist, a byproduct of [the Doctrine of the Three Swords](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/os3oqe/roleplay_romance_of_the_three_kingdoms/) being taken as gospel by its various constituents. Likewise, close proximity to unfriendly states and an inherent lack of strategic depth further heightens the need for a strengthened defence posture; Cyprus in striking distance of the Slayer, Kowloon on the edge of the Vampire coast, Greenland a stone’s throw from Borealis, North Africa as a buffer against the UASR, the Caribbean threatened by the increasingly unstable Texas and Brazil, and the Baltics on the border of the Garden all demonstrate credible threats to UNSC Permanent Members and Crown Protectorates.      

> Wars in the hyperstate era devoid of international order demonstrate that diplomatic resolutions work best when backed by force of arms already located within a given theatre, necessitating major changes to the way sovereign territory is defended. In this regard, STOICS military thinking is driven by four key conflicts:  

> + The [Downfall War](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/pem1k8/battle_timeline_downfall/), where geographic proximity to a continental conflict resulted in constant violations of neutral sovereignty  

> + The [Last Crusade](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/qmc9eh/battle_enemy_at_the_gates_the_battle_of_cyprus/), where the then-INC was forcibly drawn into a conflict by two bickering blocs with extremely loose rules of engagement 

> + The [Nightmare](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/reuinl/battle_timeline_the_chinese_nightmare), where a rogue actor prosecuted a devastating, long range act of terrorism that shattered a nation’s will to fight    
 
> + The [Caliph’s War](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1cy8sad/modpost_crisis_o_freedoms_song_roar_like_lions/), where a multinational coalition exposed the vulnerabilities of a politically-isolated superstate  

> (*Editor’s note: While at the time of this initiative’s inception, [the Brazilian affair](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dq4vvf/battle_timeline_the_first_bandung_war_surrounded/) has yet to occur, the First Bandung War would have accelerated STOICS concerns regarding both the ability of GIGAS to defend its outlying territories and the underlying threat of conventional superweapons.*)  

> These conflicts collectively demonstrate that the end of the American century has also seen an end to rational asymmetric deterrence; pressure to respond to hostilities is no longer driven by consequences and is instead dictated by the intent of the hostile actor. As such, the only successful deterrence policy is one where the opponent is convinced that the only winning move is not to play; in a variant of shock and awe, the UNSC must again demonstrate it is capable of such a successful defence against even large-scale pre-emptive attacks that the aggressor risks a massively disproportionate retaliation after achieving little-to-no tangible effects. The integrated defence of the Confederation’s areas of responsibility, therefore, must be qualitatively superior to that of its potential opponents, to the point that a territory can be successfully held until reinforcement arrives by land, sea, air, or even space.   

> To what ends the UNSC, and by extension, STOICS, must go in order to satisfy these requirements will soon become crystal clear.

##[The Great Northern Barrage](https://i.imgur.com/lhU7Tgh.png)

The importance of the European center of gravity (and by extension, the North Atlantic and Arctic theatres) to STOICS planning cannot be understated. Home to the majority of the Confederation’s wealth and manufacturing, the North Atlantic theatre’s non-contiguous geography renders it historically vulnerable to surface and undersea maritime threats, which can be utilized to disaggregate the defence area and force a defeat in detail. In order to counteract this major vector of attack against the UNSC “heartland”, STOICS Allied Maritime Command has commenced development of the **Great Northern Barrage**.   

### [Sensor-Shooter Composition](https://i.imgur.com/L8I1KrD.jpeg)  

Building on the extant ULTRASUS-INFOS chains laid during the heyday of the Arctic Custodianship, the Great Northern Barrage consists of an interlaced mixture of data fused INFOS sensor chains and CHASM-family smart networked minefields designed to serve as a major area denial solution against both surface navy and submarine threats. Unlike the legacy INFOS system, which only consisted of rows of bottom-mounted static undersea hydrophones and atomic magnetometers, the Great Northern Barrage is a three-dimensional solution, with new sensor chains suspended either directly on neutral buoyancy fiber optic cabling or remotely anchored to larger communications cables hidden underneath on the seafloor, ensuring multiple node arrays at every ~100-meter depth interval. Sensor nodes in this improved 3D INFOS “web” will still maintain the original ULTRASUS low-frequency passive hydroacoustic microphones and projectors, but will replace all existing [magnetic anomaly detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_anomaly_detector) with an array of advanced magnetometers based on RTSC [superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2144721-chinas-quantum-submarine-detector-could-seal-south-china-sea/), enhancing their detection range, sensitivity, and resolution by canceling artefacts generated by background noise. Traditional sensors are then further augmented by the addition of an underwater-adapted electro-optical [UV/visble light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet%E2%80%93visible_spectroscopy) array for passive visual identification of potential threats, supported by a series of [colored LED](https://www.subcimaging.com/case-studies/a-guide-to-subsea-lighting) [dive lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_light) for illumination at night and at greater depths (with overlapping lighting beams used to ensure complete coverage). Each upgraded INFOS sensor node will also be complemented by a net-new [wake detection system](https://www.navylookout.com/royal-navy-submarines-and-non-acoustic-sensor-technology/) heavily inspired by [SOKS](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a28724/submarine-sonar-soks/), leveraging a combination of several instruments to detect faint activation radionuclides trailing from an SSN reactor, trace amounts of chemicals in seawater via gamma ray spectrometry (inclusive of radioactive elements, zinc from sacrificial anodes designed to prevent corrosion, nickel flaking off pipes circulating reactor coolant, and hydrogen from electrolysis used to generate oxygen for the crew), and residual waste heat by measuring the water's refractive index with an optical interference system. Finally, a new [underwater laser detection system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015SPIE.9342E..21G/abstract) has been incorporated into each improved INFOS node by upcycling several of the technologies already utilized by ULTRASUS laser-based submarine-to-air communications, with [green and blue lasers](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-04/chinese-scientists-are-developing-lasers-to-find-submarines/11570886) used for long-range water penetration. Existing DAS units will also be complemented by new expendable air-deployed **Deployable Sensor System (DSS)** containers, featuring cut-down variations of the new sensor suites mentioned prior. Development of these improved INFOS nodes and DSS is set for completion in 2076.      

The upgraded three-dimensional INFOS ‘webs’ have also received cross-compatibility upgrades in order to seamlessly share data (either wirelessly via encrypted AF, laser, or fiber communications) with CHASM family naval mines (which have been either embedded into the sea floor or anchored at different depths) and a series of net-new sea-level ARIMASP floating platforms randomly scattered throughout nearby UNSC EEZs, with this cross-systems integration approach used to provide additional information for the monitoring, identification, and targeting of submarines, surface vessels, and low-flying aerial threats to the wider Barrage.   
  
In addition to a much greater array of sensing, the Great Northern Barrage further improves on the ULTRASUS model by greater disaggregation and redundancy of processing and decision-making. Instead of relying exclusively on Shore Signal Information Processing Segments (SSIPS), manned shore processing facilities are complemented by backup underwater C3 processing nodes scattered at random intervals throughout the barrage. These consist of submerged hybrid ARM/quantum supercomputing data centers, each hosting a highly-optimized sub-sentient artificial intelligence with significant machine vision capabilities designed to compare potential targets against a machine learning-compiled database of threats; these AIs are also particularly adept at discriminating suspicious acoustic voids against the ambient noise of the underwater environment, which could indicate the presence of enemy submarines. In case communications are severed with an SSPIS, the network is capable of rerouting data and deferring to human-in-the-loop commands from nearby submarines, ships, or aircraft (via transmedium laser or post-quantum/QKD-encrypted AF communications). In the absence of friendly localized assets, each Underwater Information Processing Segment (UIPS) has been provided sufficient command authority to cue an appropriate CHASM, CHASM-L, and CHASM-XL mine response depending on the threat level. This approach also makes the improved INFOS more resilient against sabotage and damage, with each UIPS delegated responsibility for managing the defense of a localized ‘web’ segment if areas of the array are ever severed from the greater network. The **Deployable Processing System (DPS)** has also been developed as a rapidly-deployable temporary UIPS solution, capable of acting as a containerized C3 node substitute during contingency events when standard SSPIS or UIPS are unavailable. Conducted in parallel to INFOS upgrades, development of UIPS and DPS is scheduled for completion in 2076.    


### [Distribution](https://i.imgur.com/Qz8sXPa.jpeg)  

Between 2076-2084, the Great Northern Barrage will be constructed based on [**this coverage map**](https://imgur.com/a/C0dNiwE), superceding the original ULTRASUS solution. INFOS webs deployed along the same axis as the extant bottom-mounted sensor chains depicted here will also see the legacy sensor nodes upgraded to the new multispectral Barrage standard. (*Note: Several sensor chains that were laid as part of the legacy ULTRASUS deployment are deliberately not depicted here; these will be disconnected from the wider ULTRASUS network and will be maintained completely separate from the new Barrage, receiving no expansion or upgrades.*)   

The most significant net-new ULTRASUS segments include:  

+ Greenland-Azores, which leverages portions of the [Mid-Atlantic Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge) for embedding and anchorage
+ Ireland-England-Siberica, which utilizes a large number of neutral buoyancy chains suspended across the Bay of Biscay
+ Madeira-Morocco, which only maintains a unitary SSPIS on the Siberican end of the connection, owing to continued instability in Rabat-Salé-Kénitra
+ England-Belgium
+ Ireland-Scotland
+ Bornholm-Kaliningrad-Gotland
+ The two Finland-Estonia segments, bridging the Gulf of Finland on the east and west
+ Svalbard-Franz Josef Land, leveraging a new STOICS garrison at the [Nagurskoye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagurskoye_(air_base\)) SSPIS enabled by the Partnership for Peace mechanism
+ Franz Josef Land-Severny Island, with another STOICS garrison at the new [Cape Zhelaniya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Zhelaniya) SSPIS
+ Norway-Arkhangelsk, which connects the [Kiberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiberg) SSPIS to a Yuzhny Island SSPIS monitored by a STOICS garrison in [Krasino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasino,_Arkhangelsk_Oblast) and a secondary STOICS garrison with a fallback SSPIS located on [Vaygach Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaygach_Island); the Vaygach Island SSPIS also acts as sole shore-based processing facility for the Vaygach-[Amderma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amderma) chain


### [Mobile Component](https://i.imgur.com/bUmuJBt.jpeg)  

The fleet of manned Resolute-class MROSS vessels supporting the legacy static ULTRASUS array will also undertake a major two-year retrofit (i.e. 2076-2078), to upgrade existing magnetic anomaly detectors to the SQUID magnetometer standard, with larger underwater electro-optical UV/VL detectors, LED diving “searchlights”, a more sensitive multi-spectral wake detection system, and higher-power laser detection array fitted into the hull below the waterline. Each Resolute-class will also receive a conformal hull-mounted [ACSMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/podenq/secret_stormaktstiden/), expanding the vessel’s original hydroacoustic sonar properties, and will receive a sentient artificial intelligence within a net-new missions center, additional storage and maintenance areas, an additive manufacturing hub, and launch & recovery systems designed to facilitate each ship’s use as a drone mothership. An additional 32x Resolute-class MROSS will also be commissioned at a rate of four delivered every two years (i.e. commissioned between 2076-2090, at a flyaway unit cost of [$80 Million](https://www.saildrone.com/news/saildrone-fleet-study-planet)), in order to supplement the older vessels.   

In addition to the growing fleet Resolute-class vessels, mobile surveillance of areas adjacent to and cordoned off by the Great Northern Barrage will now be complemented by schools of [Kongsberg-developed](https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/our-stories/autonomous-future/) attritable unmanned vehicles acting as mobile undersea monitoring solutions. The first of these, the **Segelfisk**, is a Unmanned Surface Vehicle constructed as an oceangoing [hybrid solar and wind-powered sail drone](https://www.navaltoday.com/2022/03/18/royal-navy-led-task-force-trials-solar-and-wind-powered-drones/). Effectively a [BFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jenkins_(engineer\)#Saildrone) conversion of the [Sail Drone Surveyor](https://www.saildrone.com/news/new-saildrone-surveyor-usv), the Kongsberg Segelfisk is a 15-ton, 22m-long uncrewed [ocean-going](https://www.saildrone.com/missions/atlantic-crossing) USV with a [carbon fiber composite](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/qpiwn6/eventcarbon_fiber_the_incs_panacea_to_further/) hull upcycling a large number of off-the-shelf components, such as polymer solar panels, [Mg-Air batteries](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/u6wa23/event_love_the_way_you_li), and a small outboard electric motor. Aside from the EMP-hardened COTS hybrid ARM-quantum computers hosting a sub-sentient artificial intelligence tasked with navigation and preliminary signals processing, the remainder of the Segelfisk’s mission’s suite is designed to be fully modular, with the volume inside the hull designed to support multiple plug-and-play modules adapted from the [BUDGETS](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dp3d2n/secret_lord_of_all_he_surveys/) family of low-cost ISR, navigation, and communications solutions and the same cut-down variants of the ULTRASUS-INFOS-Improved suite of sensors utilized by the DAS/DSS containerized solutions. This approach allows Segelfisk to be produced for as little as [$1.5 Million/unit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2021/08/16/with-a-sight-sound-and-radar-picture-saildrone-could-build-an-ai-database-of-everything-in-the-ocean/) on average (inclusive of modules), with [1000 units procured](https://www.saildrone.com/news/saildrone-fleet-study-planet) to support the Great Northern Barrage over the next five years (i.e. 2076-2081).   

Kongsberg’s **Rävhajar** is the more sophisticated of the Great Northern Barrage’s two autonomous mobile undersea monitoring solutions. Effectively an unmanned deep-diving minisub with a deployable [manta ray-like form factor](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/05/giant-military-manta-ray-drone-passes-first-ocean-test/396244/ ), this autonomous underwater vehicle features an ambient-pressure vessel with sensitive component modules flooded in oil in order to plug any gaps left in the static ULTRASUS arrays, particularly in deeper bathymetric zones. Prior to deployment, each Rävhajar is initially encapsulated within a stowage module with dimensions similar to the [Torped 64 Brugd](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/oj854w/secret_between_the_devil_the_deep_blue_sea/) heavyweight torpedo UUV, enabling the new UUV to be launched from and recovered by the same platforms. The unmanned underwater vehicle’s extremely-long-endurance is enabled via its unique design as an [underwater glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_glider), [varying its buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-buoyancy_propulsion) as its primary means of propulsion, with a [biomimetic hullform](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2021/july/move-shark-vanish-squid) that also allows the Rävhajar to passively [ride ocean currents](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/learning/player/lesson08/l8la2.htm). The UUV’s ambient-pressure auto-quenching aqueous Li-Air nanowire battery bank can be recharged in situ by either deploying an [oscillating floater that converts irregular wave energy into electrical energy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222010100) or by leveraging a compact [ocean thermal energy conversion system](https://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/3497-npo-43304). The Rävhajar hosts a development branch of the Segelfisk’s sub-sentient AI, optimized for deep sea missions utilizing the UUV’s unique propulsion and energy capture mechanisms. Each Rävhajar effectively acts as a mobile ULTRASUS-INFOS-Improved node, featuring the same hydrophone, SQUID-enabled magnetometer, electro-optical identification array and colored LED dive light, wake detection system, and underwater laser detection system as a standard static element of the three-dimensional sensor web. Another subvariant, the Rävhajar-C3, replaces the majority of the sensor suite with a DPS-derived Underwater Information Processing Segment, which acts as an AI-enabled mobile command, control, and processing mechanism for the nearby school. Due to the Rävhajar’s unique operating requirements, the deep-diving UUV is outfitted with additional communications systems beyond the Encrypted AF modems and laser-based submarine-to-air communications systems found standard on other undersea assets. The Rävhajar features a spool of [26km-long](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/guidance-wire-torpedoes) fiber optic cable that can be utilized to physically tether the unmanned minisub to a nearby UIPS or ULTRASUS-INFOS-Improved node. When not used as a hard-wired network connector, the cable is instead attached to an inflatable buoy containing post-quantum/QKD-encrypted wireless and laser datalinks, designed to rise straight to the surface. If the Rävhajar is operating at extreme depths exceeding the length of the cable and is unable to rise to an appropriate depth in a reasonable time, this buoy can also be detached from the UUV entirely in order to transmit the last-known coordinates of a hostile submarine to in-theatre surface and air assets, enabling a rapid ASW response. Due to their similar form factor, Rävhajar units can also be launched by any platform capable of deploying the Torped 64, and the new UUVs also maintain a comparable unit cost of $5 Million. 4000 units will be procured over the next four years following two years of development (i.e.2078-2082), with 1000 dedicated to patrol the Great Northern Barrage.   

### [Supporting Infrastructure](https://i.imgur.com/EfQqBzp.jpeg) 

Due to the integration of certain assets with limited underwater shelf lives, components of the Great Northern Barrage are intended to be routinely and covertly refreshed from logistics caches located in BFF and Siberican naval bases, leveraging minelaying and UUV mothership mechanisms aboard existing unmanned underwater vehicles like the Torped 64 Brugd, Silent Diana-N, and Nykr and a long-range, autonomous derivative of the Sagokungar’s ROVs to conduct regular maintenance and replacement of various static Barrage elements. This will ensure a high degree of readiness for the holistic network, providing excellent maritime early warning for the UNSC’s Western European permanent members, while also providing an opportunity for periodic repositioning of network nodes and emplaced mines, ensuring that any intelligence gathered on the locations of fixed elements will erode over time.

## [Theatre-level Regional Integrated Area Defence System (TRIADS)](https://i.imgur.com/Msquw2u.jpeg)   
  
STOICS Allied Response Military Authority (ARMA) has approved development of the Theatre-level Regional Integrated Area Defence System (TRIADS) as a joint initiative between the Strategic Vertical Aerospace Liaised Inter-National Network (SVALINN) tactical air command and Aalborg Kasern's Allied Land Command (ALC), with Allied Maritime Command in a supporting role. Unlike traditional IADS (which focus exclusively on aerial denial), TRIADS acts as a holistic strategic early warning, defence, and denial system capable of a multipurpose, multi-domain, multilayered approach to anti-ballistic missile, orbital, air, and coastal defence, with secondary long-range precision fires and signals/emissions intelligence capabilities.

TRIADS aggregates all [legacy STOICS-SVALINN](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/pkl2cn/secret_si_ruerit_caelum_multae_caperentur_alaudae/) and STOICS Allied Land Command assets of the UNSC Permanent Members and Crown Protectorates tasked with early warning, theatre-level ground-based air and ballistic missile defence, artillery, and coastal defence. While these primarily include orbital patrol assets and satellites, fixed radars such as those found in Aegis Ashore installations and GODMOTHERs (with the latest Skywave OTHR site constructed in southern Greenland), C2/C3 nodes, [air defence railgun complexes](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dre91i/roleplay_a_guided_walking_tour_of_the_baltic/), SAM sites, XLaser brooms, and even reactivated [coastal defence bases](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/06/finland-looks-for-new-mobile-coastal-artillery-systems) (which will be updated as autonomous, unmanned sites fielding surplus AESIR Railguns sourced from upgrades converting Allied Maritime Command surface combatants to SCADI), the nature of CULSANS as a combat cloud facilitates plug-and-play governance over SVALINN airborne AEW&C assets, local ISR planes, truck-mobile sensor systems, mobile command vehicles, SHORAD units, NASAMs platforms, Patriot batteries, and TALC containerized solutions. Unlike traditional IADS, Kuninkaallinen Tykistöprikaati artillery systems assets are also considered a part of TRIADS; long-range precision fires, surface bombardment, maritime strike, and coastal defence are all integral aspects of the Area Defence System. Additionally, the outer existing compatibility of the TALC and CAVIL LRPF solutions with JETSAMS, roll-out of new multi-purpose munitions with air intercept and indirect fires applications (see below), and the transition of the Rpbv 200 MLRS, Lancer Artillery Rocket Systems, and NSM-XER Coastal Batteries into [light common launchers](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2009-03-25-Lockheed-Martins-HIMARS-Launcher-Successfully-Fires-Air-Defense-Missile) via the rapid ad-hoc installation of missile rails will enable traditional tube and rocket artillery pieces to contribute to both coastal and air defence, further complicating attempts to defeat TRIADS.   

In addition to upgrading legacy fixed AD/BMD radar systems with pilot wave GEMMA technologies, upgrades will be also performed to ensure all air defence and artillery vehicles associated with the Area Defence System have received their own organic GEMMA radar systems to enable these shooters to identify targets even when battlespace network information is unavailable. Likewise, support vehicles operating the ubiquitous Dagr point defence system will also receive an integrated BUDGETS sensor suite, enabling even supporting logistics vehicles to contribute as ISR nodes with [low probability of intercept](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/pg0i1o/secret_quantum_buzzword/) radar capabilities.  
  
As a supplement to the Dagr directed energy self-protection suite, development of a new bolt-on hard-kill countermeasure dispenser will be developed to provide an additional APS layer for Allied Land Command ground vehicles. The **Dellingr** is a [modular active protection system](https://newatlas.com/maps-anti-tank-countermeasures/58722/) conversion of the
[AZRAEL’s 16-Cell APS module](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/rg0vlo/secret_we_are_the_dead/). Designed to seamlessly interface with vehicle-borne sensor suites (even those aboard existing APS), each Dellingr is a plug-and-play turnkey APS solution for installation on the roof of a ground vehicle, energized by an Mg-Air battery bank routinely charged by the transport’s own electrical system. Instead of Miniature Immediate-Neutralization Interceptors (MINIs), each Dellingr is loaded with 16 units of the [Self-defence Low-cost Interceptor Missile (SLIM)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/r30798/secret_rebuild_of_tempest_20_you_can_not_upgrade/) used by UNSC armored fighting vehicles, taking advantage of SLIM’s shared form factor. When an inbound threat to the vehicle is detected either by its onboard sensors or via the SAINTS/CULSANS network, the Dellingr triggers an explosive launch of one or more SLIMs, accelerating these munitions to appropriate ramjet ignition velocity. Post-launch guidance falls to each SLIM’s onboard seeker, which enables the miniature hit-to-kill missile to conduct intercepts within a 3km radius of the launcher.  

Dellingr is intended to provide non-stealthy ground vehicles such as mobile radar platforms with an on-demand solution to anti-radiation missiles, cruise missiles, and C-RAM. As part of the wider TRIADS development, it will therefore be rolled out across all Allied Land Command and SVALINN ground vehicles without their own integrated VLS APS solutions (inclusive of artillery platforms, logistics trucks, and C3 vehicles). As part of this initiative, any ground vehicle that did not already have the Dagr APS installed will also receive one with the aforementioned BUDGETS sensor suite upgrade. For vehicles requiring VLO characteristics, signature mitigation measures, including conformal RCS-minimized housings with Mignolecule® coatings have been applied.  
 
While not technically under the TRIADS umbrella of responsibilities, the Area Defence System is also designed to interface directly with Allied Maritime Command’s Great Northern Barrage and other static early warning/area denial assets. Hydrophone networks, smart minefields, and ARIMASP surveillance networks will be integrated with TRIADS in order to seamlessly share information via SAINTS and CULSANS, providing greater maritime situational awareness that can be leveraged for multi-domain operational responses. Allied Maritime Command shore-based facilities will also be physically hardwired into static cyber-secured TRIADS nodes via the laying of underground communications fibre cabling, serving as a further redundancy to wireless communication and laser datalinks. Similarly, STOICS warships and naval aviation which happen to fall within the boundaries of TRIADS subsectors will be utilized both as sources for early warning and ISR data and can be issued command orders for air/missile defence tasks and naval bombardment via the CULSANS combat cloud.   

Similar to [Vigilare](https://www.boeing.com.au/products-services/defence-space-security/wakulda), TRIADS also consolidates data sourced from civilian sources. These include Air Traffic Control radars, weather service radars, and even marine radars on UNSC merchant shipping (leveraging existing naval auxiliary relationships with major logistics companies), with information sourced unidirectionally though a [data diode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_network) and scrutinized by a choir of cyberwarfare-specialized Artificial Intelligences prior to being incorporated into the CULSANS-protected SAINTS environment. “Crowdsourced” surveillance from civil air and maritime sources is cross-referenced against military ISR and data fused to broaden both the scope of intelligence gathering operations and situational awareness of the Confederation's surveillance picture.  

     

### [ARC](https://i.imgur.com/idwBCj5.jpeg)   

To augment legacy solutions, TRIADS introduces multiple new-build **Active Response Complexes (ARCs)** acting as static anchor points scattered throughout the network. ARCs effectively act as successors to [Aegis Ashore sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_System#Aegis_Ashore), with fixed, hardened bases containing a variety of key enabler sensor-shooter systems.  

#### [ARC Sensors Integration](https://i.imgur.com/PyvGhE8.jpeg)  

At the center of each ARC is an elevated triangular pyramid, with each of the three faces mounting a 100 square meter Giraffe Electronic Modular Missions Array (GEMMA) assembled out of 200 hexagonal modular tiles. This tetrahedral arrangement of raised conformal antenna arrays provides a trio of all-aspect pilot wave conformal photonic graphene quantum MIMO AESAs with 360-degree coverage, capable of discrimination and detection of air, ballistic, LEO, and surface targets (with the latter being horizon-limited) up to 1575 nmi from the site, with secondary SIGINT/ELINT monitoring capability providing additional value as a [listening station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listening_station). Each GEMMA pyramid is capable of acting in either monostatic or [bistatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistatic_radar) operating modes. In effect, this capability enables the ARC's pyramid to act as an extremely powerful emitter in a wider [multistatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistatic_radar) array, with the latter capability enabling the fixed radar to illuminate targets on behalf of mobile in-theatre assets operating in [EMCON](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_silence) with their own [passive radar receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_radar), providing high quality, high resolution fire control solutions to shooters even without the use of battlespace networking communications. The apex of the sensor pyramid also hosts a high-performance multi-spectrum electro-optical search package, with 360-degree wideband 128K EO/IR/UV/VL surveillance, a spectroscopic target identification system consisting of a turret-mounted 20-centimeter telescopic mirror and IR/UV multi-modal sensor for wide area scan and detection of even exoatmospheric targets, and an ultra-long-distance quantum LiDAR optronic suite for quantum illumination.  

In order to offset the radar horizon limit imposed on the pyramidal GEMMA array, ARCs will also feature a [compact HF surface wave radar array](https://www.codar.com/images/about/BarrPedeEEZ2004.pdf) consisting of a pair of raised multi-element super directive receive arrays. These [HFSWRs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-horizon_radar#Alternative_Approaches_to_Over_the_Horizon_Radar) operate on wavelengths between 4 and 20 MHz, and differentiate themselves from larger skywave OTHR solutions like GODMOTHER by leveraging the propagation of [groundwaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_wave) over significant distances. Each ARC's HFSWRs provide bistatic over-the-horizon radar coverage via groundwave diffraction, and for Complexes constructed in the vicinity of coasts, the high conductivity of nearby seawater increases the coverage area to 400+ km from the site. These HFSWRs are also capable of operating as part of larger multistatic networks with adjacent ARCs in order to increase system robustness against air, surface, and maritime threats.     


#### [ARC NordVPM Integration](https://i.imgur.com/ZkW9ETV.jpeg)  

Similar to [existing SVALINN-controlled Aegis Ashore sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/t6uyg5/event_better_late_than_never/), ARCs disperse a [trio of multiple vertical launch enclosures](https://imgur.com/s8mBukz) hosting NordVPM hexagonal canisters around each Complex; each ARC hosts a total of 30 full-strike-length hexes, split equally between the three launchers. Where ARC diverges from the legacy Aegis Ashore complex design, however, is by burying its NordVPM canisters underground within siloed bunkers constructed from multiple layers of [spaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_armour) BNNT-composite nanomaterial armor, shielding each vertical launch enclosure behind Nanocrete and BNNT-composite metamaterial lattice reinforced blast doors. These underground batteries are physically hardened to standards comparable to (or in excess of) the protections enjoyed by traditional [Ballistic Missile Launch Facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_launch_facility#Minuteman_facilities), making them extremely-survivable static emplacements. Uniquely, reload of the NordVPM canisters is performed by a large [automated underground ammunition movement system](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dre91i/roleplay_a_guided_walking_tour_of_the_baltic/); the underground logistics network of each ARC is designed to move fresh munitions and adapters from a hardened underground weapons magazine and slot these systems Into NordVPM hexes from below, enabling customization of the contents of each battery to better handle detected threats while also ensuring consistent readiness even while the Complex is under attack.   

####[JETSAM Capabilities Upgrade](https://i.imgur.com/8BwEhTp.jpeg)  

As the primary air and missile defence capability for NordVPM, significant improvements to the Joint Engagement Tactical Surface to Air Missile (JETSAM) family have been made concurrently with the design and construction of ARC sites throughout the UNSC in order to enhance their full spectrum lethality. As a result, the following will be applied for universal roll-out to all STOICS member JETSAM operators:  

+ Legacy applications for CL-20 fuel and explosives have been substituted with newly-synthesized, extremely insensitive [Octaazacubane (N8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octaazacubane) monopropellant for various metamaterial-mediated throttleable motors, rocket stages, and boosters, providing substantial increases to theoretical energy density and detonation velocity (with N8's [REF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent#Relative_effectiveness_factor) value being more than triple that of CL-20). (Note: This change does not impact Liquid NOx and Energetic Ionic Liquid monopropellants, such as those found aboard the LBD-SAM, Shrike, and AKKV solutions.)  

+ Several JETSAM missiles have been retooled to utilize a series of scaled, multimodal modular warheads. Each warhead is designed to autonomously select one of five engagement modes during terminal intercept, choosing between hit-to-kill, electronically-controlled 3D directional High Explosive blast fragmentation, [SAPHEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_incendiary/armor-piercing_ammunition), [HESH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_squash_head), and Self-forging Explosive Penetrator Type (SEPT) intercepts. Electronically-controlled HE, SAPHEI, HESH, and SEPT engagements leverage the warhead’s insensitive N8 nanocomposite explosive filler packed into a [metal matrix composite energetic structure](https://patents.justia.com/patent/7886668), resulting in improved blast effects without adversely impacting weight or volume. Three-dimensional blast pattern and multiple explosively-formed aerodynamic penetrator targeting can be performed either by the warhead or based on inputs from the onboard seeker, ensuring maximum effects.  

+ Optional [lightcraft boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1f1ug42/secret_over_the_horizon/) can now also be integrated aboard all JETSAMs, improving weapon kinematics by leveraging point defence FELs co-located at each site to preserve more energy for terminal intercept and extending the range of each weapon by approximately 75-140km.   

+ The S-SAM and I-SAM systems will see their LOWER-AD missile components fully substituted for [BLOWER-AD](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/v2upy6/secret_synergy/) equivalents, which will see a reduction of cost per kill from [$150,000](https://imgur.com/d3S4wA7) to $50,000 without any loss of capability or reliability, enabling massing and dispersion of these systems across ARC NordVPM magazines while still leveraging the double-stacked coilgun adapter configuration to enable up to 62 x units installed within each ARC reinforced NordVPM hex. Further testing and certification of the S-SAM/I-SAM with the new N8 rocket motors/boosters will enable utilization of these missiles in both a [C-RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-RAM) capacity (comparable to an attrition-focused [Iron Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome)) and for terminal ABM (similar to the [PAC-3 MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#PAC-3_MSE) and [Skyceptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#SkyCeptor_(PAAC-4\)), respectively). Likewise, S-SAM and I-SAM will inherit the same terminal hypersonic cruise missile intercept and [Counter-Small Unmanned Aerial Systems](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/land/counter-unmanned-aerial-systems-c-uas) capability currently leveraged by BLOWER-AD’s sister AAM, LOWER-A2A.

To a short-term gain of USD and up to USD in a few years. It's not a sure thing, but it looks more than possible. A bunch of folks shouted silver and quickly regretted it as investors unleashed large buy orders and crushed the shorts.

That's strength. Physical or certs are acceptable for long-term buying from one of the big solid companies. The problem is liquidity. Stocks as gold proxies can be bought and sold practically the order entered.

**Number One**

**Element79 Gold Corp.** (CSE: ELEM) (FSE: 7YS0) (OTC: ELMGF) (""Element79"" or the ""Company"") is a mining company focused on exploring and developing its past-producing, high-grade gold and silver mine, the Lucero Project. This project is strategically located in Arequipa, Peru, a region known for its rich mineral deposits, with the intent to restart production in the near term.

https://preview.redd.it/71dyidxxv85e1.jpg?width=1901&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=455f8b917ff10f6b940012d79fad1a1428eb8266

**Who We Are**

Element79 Gold is a near-term cash-flow mining company focused on gold, silver, and associated metals. It is committed to maximizing shareholder value through responsible mining practices and sustainable project development.

Our flagship project, Lucero, is a previously produced high-grade gold mine. It is permitted for 350 tpd of ore extraction and has the immediate-term potential to generate revenue, and we are currently working to bring it back into production in 2024 and beyond. The Lucero Project holds significant promise, and we are optimistic about its potential to yield substantial returns.

**Key Assets**

Element79 Gold's flagship property is a cash-flow generator. The Lucero Mine is permitted for 350 tpd, and we are working to bring this high-grade gold mine back into production in 2024.

The company also owns notable exploration assets along the Battle Mountain trend in Nevada, Clover, which will be explored and drilled with the intent to generate resource value (Website). Another Corporate asset is the amount of relevant verbiage released to keep investors in the know.

[Corporate Presentation](https://www.element79.gold/_files/ugd/0feb69_690e123bc0844d94ae6c88c1f072e30b.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/06h35y81w85e1.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c80ecd344dd010c0bbe0486324e7138f79a9dc

Investors are entreated to trust that the very experienced management can bring Lucero back into play. Why? Even though the shares have weakened, an excellent volume of trading has appeared, indicating a strong interest in the company's stock.

Four hundred fifty-five underground channel samples have been collected from this latest phase, representing nearly 600 kg (620kg) of mineralization and 650 kg of wall rock, which underwent comprehensive analysis by our partners at Ore Discovery and unveiled significant exploration potential. Notably, results in 115 samples returned substantial values in gold (Au) (ranging from 1.0 g/t to 98.1 g/t), silver (Ag) (ranging from 0.7 g/t to 3,026 g/t), lead (Pb) (as high as 2.0%) and zinc (Zn) (up to 3.5%), highlighting the robust potential of Lucero's mineral endowment.

A place in your long-term, junior gold sector of your portfolio. I own some. I am looking for the APR telling me Lucero is in serious production. And the gold price has exceeded USD.

**Number Two**

**Galloper Gold Corp.** **(CSE: BOOM; OTC: GGDCF; Frankfurt: W9F) (the “Company” or “Galloper**”) is an intriguing stock with some exciting properties, including Glover Island in Western Newfoundland.

https://preview.redd.it/b7t8l395w85e1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=691c83d86f246bb304c9471073824f0500ad0200

*Galloper’s land, covering 133 sq. km, is considered highly prospective for structurally controlled orogenic gold deposits, as well as copper-gold-rich VMS deposits. Galloper is the dominant landowner on Glover Island, essentially creating 'our island on an island' with exceptional discovery potential. This unique position sets us apart and adds an element of intrigue to our investment proposition.*

**Salient Points**

·  **Galloper Gold is focused on advancing its flagship Glover Island asset in western Newfoundland.**

·  **Glover Island is at the convergence of major fault zones, where a known historic gold resource defined by dozens of drill holes more than a decade ago exists.**

·  **Galloper's 133 sq km land package surrounds this historic zone, continuing along a northeast trend for 36 km, and it is a potential new large-scale gold discovery.**

**Driven by a management and technical team with successful exploration and production backgrounds, and supported by capital markets expertise, Galloper's ""outside the box"" thinking helps make the company a unique player in an increasingly selective junior resource sector.**

[**Corporate Presentation**](https://gallopergold.com/GalloperGold_October21_2024.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/5eaklrzaw85e1.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=079025656654d0d40c89bfc3b218bf43677e6a67

The chart shows weakening and softening recently, as does ELEM above, but it likely represents a good junior gold proxy in a long-term junior portfolio. There have been some nice trading spikes over the last few weeks, indicating periods of increased trading activity and potential profit opportunities for investors.

Mr. Hratch Jabrayan, Galloper CEO, commented: *“Glover Island represents compelling new discovery opportunities well beyond the known historic deposit defined more than a dozen years ago, so we’re excited to begin the drilling phase of our work there. Most of Glover Island has never been systematically explored as evidenced by the copper anomaly we’ve uncovered on the western side of the Island. The convergence of major faults at Glover Island and the widespread presence of ‘the right rocks’ is an excellent recipe for a potential large-scale system consistent with what has been observed elsewhere in this ‘Four Corners’ region of Western Newfoundland.”*

Galloper's other property is Mint Pond.

Galloper's other property, Mint Pond, holds the potential to emerge as a significant new grassroots gold and/or base metals discovery following Galloper's 2022-2023 work programs. The property, never previously explored, has shown promising signs with **initial soil sampling revealing anomalous gold and copper value**s in clusters, a result that was highly encouraging when combined with data from Galloper's LiDAR Survey and regional magnetic surveys

Galloper boasts an [**impressive team**](https://gallopergold.com/team/) with decades of business and broad mining experience. The newly installed CEO, Hratch Jabrayan, brings over two decades of high-level resource sector experience to Galloper, including seven years with Dundee Precious Metals, where he significantly advanced the company's interests in Armenia and globally. This wealth of experience should instil confidence in the team's ability to lead Galloper to success.

The team at Boom is a group of seasoned mining professionals with a proven track record. Their experience and capabilities make them well-suited to bring BOOM into production. Galloper, under their leadership, is focused on mineral exploration in the Central Newfoundland Gold Belt with its Glover Island and Mint Pond properties, each prospective for gold and base metals. The Glover Island Property consists of 532 mining claims totaling 13,300 hectares while Mint Pond consists of 499 claims totaling 12,475 hectares.

Again, it seems to be a good prospect and proxy for the ring gold market shortly.As with ELEM, I eagerly anticipate the future PR as both companies ramp up production. The upcoming announcements are sure to bring exciting news and further boost investor interest."
"Psihopatie
",politica,1h6amq6,2024-12-04 02:29:29,6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politica/comments/1h6amq6/psihopatie/,Chebelea,Alegeri,"Un text publicat în urmă cu câteva zile pe *Contributors*, cu titlul *Piromanul*, se încheia cu aceste cuvinte: „*Vă mărturisesc că mi-e frică*”. Unii dintre comentatori au crezut că fac o mărturisire de lașitate, menită să ne descurajeze pe toți. Dar nu, nu de asta era vorba. Poate cuiva i-ar fi frică dacă ar vedea un om cu coadă de leopard ieșindu-i din pantaloni sau un om cu urechi de elefant. Eu mi-aș spune că n-ar avea ce rău să-mi facă. M-aș gândi că o fi vorba despre o mutație genetică inofensivă și m-aș freca la ochi. În schimb, mi-ar fi frică, și chiar îmi e teribil de frică, de un om care nu mai are capul pe umeri, fără să știu unde-l are sau dacă l-a avut vreodată.  
Ceea ce mă stupefiază în zilele acestea nu este în primul rând incapacitatea multora de a decoda – și clasifica – discursul unui candidat la prezidențiale care nu are nimic comun cu un program politic. Cu-adevărat mă stupefiază el, omul care cere un vot propunând, în locul unui proiect electoral, un balamuc verbal, o vomă care se prelinge scârbavnic și grandoman în urechile tuturor. Niciodată cuvântul „român” n-a fost mai cu sârg gargarisit, mai jalnic târnosit într-o asemenea mâzgă lingvistică.  
Neștiind să diagnostichez cazul rezumându-mă la cuvântul generic „șarlatan”, am apelat la un prieten psihiatru. I-am trimis maldărul de propoziții de mai jos, cu rugămintea să mă lumineze el în privința unui diagnostic. Iată mai jos sumarul pe care i l-am trimis, decupat din presă. Vă propun să-l citim – sau recitim – fără patimă, cu detașare și atenție de laborator.

**Despre România, despre destinul ei cosmic, despre poporul român,   despre apele, iarba, pădurile și munții lui**  
„România este un sanctuar cosmic care susține echilibrul planetei.”  
„Carpații sunt antenele care captează energia universală pentru întreaga umanitate.”  
„România este Grădina Maicii Domnului și are o misiune divină.”  
„Hristos a înviat pentru ca poporul român să devină un far al lumii.”  
„Românii sunt gardienii ultimei oaze de spiritualitate autentică din Europa.”  
„Fiecare fir de iarbă din România are o semnificație sacră în echilibrul universal.”  
„România este locul unde divinitatea a decis să păstreze esența purității umane.”  
„Fiecare român are în el o scânteie divină care poate aprinde lumina universală.”  
„Credința colectivă a românilor poate schimba cursul istoriei.”  
„Rugăciunea colectivă a românilor poate salva lumea de distrugerea spirituală.”  
„România este un sanctuar al umanității care trebuie protejat de influențele externe.”  
„Destinul României este să fie un exemplu de echilibru.  
„Fiecare rugăciune făcută în România hrănește energiile universale ale luminii.”  
„Carpații nu sunt doar munți, ci sanctuare ale energiilor divine.”  
„Carpații sunt coloane ale creației, care conectează dimensiunile spirituale.”  
„Carpații sunt coloanele de lumină care susțin echilibrul energetic al întregii planete.”  
Etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc………………………….

După ce a primit palmaresul de mai sus în forma lui extinsă, prietenul psihiatru m-a sunat și mi-a spus: „Dragul meu, omul nostru, din punct de vedere psihiatric, are caracteristici de *psihopat*. Spre deosebire de psihotic, psihopatul nu poate fi tratat. Stalin, Hitler și alții asemenea care au populat istoria omenirii nu erau psihotici, nu delirau. Erau psihopați. Însă spre deosebire de Stalin sau Hitler a căror psihopatie gravita în jurul unei ideologii, candidatul nostru e psihopat în termeni ezoterici, e fascinat de ocultism, de antivaccinism și de pseudo-știință. Nu are ideologie. Psihopat fiind, are și valențe de escroc cabotin, care își pune bine în scenă psihopatia de sușă grețos-naționalistă.  
Ar mai fi ceva de zis. Psihopații nu sunt doar periculoși pe cont propriu. Sunt cu atât mai periculoși cu cât sunt și vulnerabili, adică lesne manipulabili și instrumentalizabili, ușor de folosit, în psihopatia lor, de către profitori lucizi.”  
Mi s-a părut că diagnosticul pus de prietenul meu era oarecum abrupt, drept care am simțit nevoia să consult *The Cambridge Dictionary of Psychology*, ca să mă lămuresc dacă la omul nostru era vorba sau nu de un deranjament îngrijorător. Astfel am aflat mai în detaliu cum sunt tranșate diferențele dintre un psihotic și un psihopat.  
Cel mai adesea, *psihoticul* are doar *episoade* psihotice, în care, pierzând contactul cu realitatea, poate avea halucinații (aude voci, are distorsiuni perceptive etc.), deliruri (i se pare că este urmărit sau e convins că a căzut sub puterea cuiva etc.) și gândire dezorganizată. Psihoticul nu e agresiv comportamental și poate fi tratat prin medicație antipsihotică (neuroleptice).  
*Psihopatul* este caracterizat printr-o tulburare psihologică încadrabilă la categoria „tulburare de personalitate antisocială” (ASPD –  *antisocial personality disorder*). Psihopatia e definită ca „lipsă de empatie, manipulare extremă și comportament lipsit de remușcări”, manipularea ajungând până la capacitatea de a subjuga mințile a mase largi de oameni. Psihopatul e calculat, planifică totul pornind de la interesul propriu, e primejdios, dispus oricând să calce în picioare drepturile celorlalți, programând escrocheria, amenințarea, violența.  
Ei bine, într-o măsură m-am liniștit. Omul nostru nu era încadrabil clinic, ci doar dotat cu structură de psihopat. Dar chiar și așa, m-am întrebat, de vreme ce au avut acces din timp la gândirea astfel exprimată a personajului care dă foc țării, cum se face că instituțiile statului i-au lăsat drum liber spre vârf? Nu e oare firesc să ne fie teamă că o țară întreagă riscă să locuiască în curând în mintea unui asemenea om care, în plus, grație aplicațiilor digitale și poate și inteligenței artificiale, a beneficiat și de dibăcia cu care ele pot influența alegătorii?  
Acum, dacă vreau să consider psihopatia nu din punct de vedere psihiatric, ci filozofic, aș spune că ea este *o înjosire a rațiunii*, adică a tot ce a pus mai de preț evoluția pe lume. Fiind un viraj extrem al minții, psihopatia se poate solda cu emergența unui *monstrum*, cu o entitate care iese din limitele lui *humanum*, cu un *omen* malefic care amenință din viitor.  
Acel „mi-e frică!” din textul *Piromanul*, nu e o invitație la fugă, ci la o replică în fața primejdiei: constat primejdia, mi-o asu­­­­m, o văd venind către mine şi mă duc în întâmpi­narea ei. Cine o fi spus că „frica li­beră este frică în­vinsă şi de aceea, în mod esen­ţial, curaj”?  
Mă mai intrigă însă și un alt lucru, de astă dată în ordine, ca să zic așa, duhovnicească. Oare un adevărat credincios ar accepta să vadă numele lui Dumnezeu arestat peste noapte între granițele unei țări care, atunci când și-a apărat demnitatea și și-a ales destinul, a făcut-o *în numele libertății* *sale*, și nu recurgând la cerșetorie magico-religioasă? Numai un credincios rătăcit crede că Dumnezeu a hotărât să se mute duminică în Carpați abandonând restul universului, ca să-i țină pumnii unuia cu capul rătăcit în fantasma puterii.  
Acum, lăsând deoparte orice deriziune, aș spune, urmând o înțeleaptă observație a unui compatriot, că nu cu inocentul și mult încercatul nostru electorat avem a ne răfui, ci cu cei care, de-atâta amar de vreme, ne-au pus în situația de a alege între hoți, psihopați, securiști sau pur și simplu nesimțiți.

**Number One**

**Element79 Gold Corp.** (CSE: ELEM) (FSE: 7YS0) (OTC: ELMGF) (""Element79"" or the ""Company"") is a mining company focused on exploring and developing its past-producing, high-grade gold and silver mine, the Lucero Project. This project is strategically located in Arequipa, Peru, a region known for its rich mineral deposits, with the intent to restart production in the near term.

https://preview.redd.it/xo4r9vi4hn4e1.jpg?width=1901&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c98fb0b83fe055c3177bb7115afb2b4432bdf988

**Who We Are**

Element79 Gold is a near-term cash-flow mining company focused on gold, silver, and associated metals. It is committed to maximizing shareholder value through responsible mining practices and sustainable project development.

Our flagship project, Lucero, is a previously produced high-grade gold mine. It is permitted for 350 tpd of ore extraction and has the immediate-term potential to generate revenue, and we are currently working to bring it back into production in 2024 and beyond. The Lucero Project holds significant promise, and we are optimistic about its potential to yield substantial returns.

**Key Assets**

Element79 Gold's flagship property is a cash-flow generator. The Lucero Mine is permitted for 350 tpd, and we are working to bring this high-grade gold mine back into production in 2024.

The company also owns notable exploration assets along the Battle Mountain trend in Nevada, Clover, which will be explored and drilled with the intent to generate resource value (Website). Another Corporate asset is the amount of relevant verbiage released to keep investors in the know.

Investors are entreated to trust that the very experienced management can bring Lucero back into play. Why? Even though the shares have weakened, an excellent volume of trading has appeared, indicating a strong interest in the company's stock.

Four hundred fifty-five underground channel samples have been collected from this latest phase, representing nearly 600 kg (620kg) of mineralization and 650 kg of wall rock, which underwent comprehensive analysis by our partners at Ore Discovery and unveiled significant exploration potential. Notably, results in 115 samples returned substantial values in gold (Au) (ranging from 1.0 g/t to 98.1 g/t), silver (Ag) (ranging from 0.7 g/t to 3,026 g/t), lead (Pb) (as high as 2.0%) and zinc (Zn) (up to 3.5%), highlighting the robust potential of Lucero's mineral endowment.

A place in your long-term, junior gold sector of your portfolio. I own some. I am looking for the APR telling me Lucero is in serious production. And the gold price has exceeded USD.

**Number Two**

**Galloper Gold Corp.** **(CSE: BOOM; OTC: GGDCF; Frankfurt: W9F) (the “Company” or “Galloper**”) is an intriguing stock with some exciting properties, including Glover Island in Western Newfoundland.

https://preview.redd.it/f6t7tlpehn4e1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a76f49cdf6e8303095172d7c7f727c00e964fb1c

*Galloper’s land, covering 133 sq. km, is considered highly prospective for structurally controlled orogenic gold deposits, as well as copper-gold-rich VMS deposits. Galloper is the dominant landowner on Glover Island, essentially creating 'our island on an island' with exceptional discovery potential. This unique position sets us apart and adds an element of intrigue to our investment proposition.*

**Salient Points**

·  **Galloper Gold is focused on advancing its flagship Glover Island asset in western Newfoundland.**

·  **Glover Island is at the convergence of major fault zones, where a known historic gold resource defined by dozens of drill holes more than a decade ago exists.**

·  **Galloper's 133 sq km land package surrounds this historic zone, continuing along a northeast trend for 36 km, and it is a potential new large-scale gold discovery.**

**Driven by a management and technical team with successful exploration and production backgrounds, and supported by capital markets expertise, Galloper's ""outside the box"" thinking helps make the company a unique player in an increasingly selective junior resource sector.**

The chart shows weakening and softening recently, as does ELEM above, but it likely represents a good junior gold proxy in a long-term junior portfolio. There have been some nice trading spikes over the last few weeks, indicating periods of increased trading activity and potential profit opportunities for investors.

Mr. Hratch Jabrayan, Galloper CEO, commented: *“Glover Island represents compelling new discovery opportunities well beyond the known historic deposit defined more than a dozen years ago, so we’re excited to begin the drilling phase of our work there. Most of Glover Island has never been systematically explored as evidenced by the copper anomaly we’ve uncovered on the western side of the Island. The convergence of major faults at Glover Island and the widespread presence of ‘the right rocks’ is an excellent recipe for a potential large-scale system consistent with what has been observed elsewhere in this ‘Four Corners’ region of Western Newfoundland.”*

Galloper's other property is Mint Pond.

Galloper's other property, Mint Pond, holds the potential to emerge as a significant new grassroots gold and/or base metals discovery following Galloper's 2022-2023 work programs. The property, never previously explored, has shown promising signs with **initial soil sampling revealing anomalous gold and copper value**s in clusters, a result that was highly encouraging when combined with data from Galloper's LiDAR Survey and regional magnetic surveys

Galloper boasts an **impressive team** with decades of business and broad mining experience. The newly installed CEO, Hratch Jabrayan, brings over two decades of high-level resource sector experience to Galloper, including seven years with Dundee Precious Metals, where he significantly advanced the company's interests in Armenia and globally. This wealth of experience should instil confidence in the team's ability to lead Galloper to success.

The team at Boom is a group of seasoned mining professionals with a proven track record. Their experience and capabilities make them well-suited to bring BOOM into production. Galloper, under their leadership, is focused on mineral exploration in the Central Newfoundland Gold Belt with its Glover Island and Mint Pond properties, each prospective for gold and base metals. The Glover Island Property consists of 532 mining claims totaling 13,300 hectares while Mint Pond consists of 499 claims totaling 12,475 hectares.

Again, it seems to be a good prospect and proxy for the ring gold market shortly.As with ELEM, I eagerly anticipate the future PR as both companies ramp up production. The upcoming announcements are sure to bring exciting news and further boost investor interest."

https://preview.redd.it/noux8f21bh4e1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=31087607e815fc20b13bd969a117991c9e3f03b0

# Introduction

“Only by mastering crucial core technologies within our own hands,” said Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, “can we \[China\] truly seize the initiative in competition and development, and fundamentally safeguard our national economic security, national security, and security in other domains.”[^(1)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-248259) Xi’s declaration underscores his desire to transform China into a science and technology great power, which, he argues, hinges on tightening “international production chains’ dependence on China.”[^(2)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-248259) LiDAR, a remote sensing technology with both military and civilian applications, stands at the center of Beijing’s bid for technological superiority.

Xi’s technological vision is not just an ambition — it is already materializing. Today, Chinese companies are rapidly consolidating control over the global LiDAR market, with PRC-origin sensors now widely deployed across civilian and military networks worldwide, including in the United States. These sensors often serve as essential nodes within interconnected public safety, transportation, and utility systems, which is a clear benefit to the United States. However, Chinese LiDAR’s system-wide integration also leaves its users vulnerable to espionage and sabotage, potentially enabling Beijing to access sensitive U.S. data or disrupt critical operations.

For decades, Beijing has used cyber operations to breach sensitive networks and infiltrate critical infrastructure in the U.S.[^(3)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-248259) China’s military and intelligence services could leverage Chinese-made LiDAR systems for espionage purposes, much as they have exploited the compromised communication gear sold by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.[^(4)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-248259) The widespread adoption of Chinese-made LiDAR technology also advances Xi’s “comprehensive national security” (总体国家安全) concept, which merges technological development with state security to enhance China’s geopolitical advantage.[^(5)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-248259) In practice, Beijing could weaponize Western reliance on Chinese-made systems by manipulating or disrupting LiDAR supply chains as it has done repeatedly with rare earth elements to pressure other countries into accepting its strategic demands.

This memo provides an overview of LiDAR technology, detailing its expanding use across the United States. Next, it examines how LiDAR operates and how China could exploit the broad adoption of PRC-made LiDAR sensors to facilitate espionage or sabotage of critical U.S. networks and infrastructure. Finally, the memo outlines actionable steps policymakers can take to prevent Chinese exploitation of LiDAR technologies and protect U.S. national security.

Countering Chinese LiDAR dominance requires integrating LiDAR into a comprehensive industrial policy that bolsters U.S. technological leadership and economic competitiveness. This approach must go beyond simply reducing reliance on untrusted vendors from foreign countries of concern. It should also focus on expanding domestic LiDAR production capacity and fostering trusted supply-chain partnerships with allied nations. Establishing and enforcing rigorous cybersecurity standards for LiDAR technology will also be essential to safeguarding critical infrastructure and ensuring LiDAR’s secure integration into both civilian and military networks. 

# LiDAR Backgrounder

LiDAR (or Light Detection and Ranging) is an advanced remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to create highly detailed, three-dimensional maps of surrounding environments. By calculating the time it takes for these pulses to return to a sensor, LiDAR can generate precise spatial data far exceeding traditional methods, like radar and sonar. While LiDAR was originally developed in 1961 by Hughes Research Laboratory for lunar exploration, it has evolved into an indispensable tool in a wide range of civilian and military applications worldwide.[^(6)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-248259)

The technology’s most well-known civilian application is in the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry, where LiDAR sensors enable real-time object detection and safe navigation in dynamic driving environments. LiDAR has also been integrated into drone, train, and airport transportation systems for similar purposes. Additionally, utility companies and critical infrastructure providers are increasingly using LiDAR to monitor pipelines, power lines, and rail networks, proactively identifying structural weaknesses and environmental hazards before they compromise system integrity.

Urban planners are also integrating LiDAR with artificial intelligence and machine learning to build so-called “safe cities.”[^(7)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-248259) For example, many cities rely on LiDAR sensors to monitor traffic flows at major road intersections and automatically adjust traffic signals to reduce congestion**.** LiDAR-enabled alerts can also provide emergency responders with critical, real-time information about vehicle accidents and other safety hazards, enabling more efficient response times. Lastly, LiDAR can optimize city services, such as waste management and energy distribution, by delivering precise data on usage patterns and infrastructure conditions, streamlining resource allocation, and enhancing public safety.[^(8)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-248259)

LiDAR’s applications are becoming essential to modern military and defense systems, too. U.S. reconnaissance and missile guidance systems rely on LiDAR to enhance target acquisition, terrain analysis, and navigation in hostile environments. Looking toward the future of warfare, the Department of Defense’s Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative aims to integrate data and technology across military platforms to improve battlefield awareness, which will include outfitting next-generation autonomous military vehicles and drones with fully integrated LiDAR suites.[^(9)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-248259) For instance, the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift program, focused on developing advanced helicopters, will rely on LiDAR for real-time terrain mapping and obstacle avoidance capabilities.[^(10)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-248259)

China has also prioritized LiDAR as part of its ongoing military modernization. Under its “intelligentized warfare” concept, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is integrating LiDAR into defense systems to boost battlefield awareness and precision-strike capabilities.[^(11)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-248259) LiDAR has reportedly been installed on autonomous Chinese military platforms, including an autonomous fighting vehicle developed by the PLA in partnership with UISEE Technology and Dongfeng Motors. Equipped with advanced LiDAR from Chinese manufacturers such as Hesai, these and other LiDAR-enabled platforms are poised to become a “trump card,” or decisive advantage, in enhancing Chinese reconnaissance operations, according to Chinese state media.[^(12)](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-248259)

# DEC. 2nd 2024~ Chinese lidar sensors pose hacking risk to US defense equipment, report says

[Chinese lidar sensors pose hacking risk to US defence equipment, report says | The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/chinese-lidar-sensors-pose-hacking-risk-to-us-defence-equipment-report-says)

[China has become a major player in the lidar industry with firms such as Hesai Group. PHOTO: REUTERS](https://preview.redd.it/8v5rn1c1dh4e1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=261ad27937cda6d694cc1eea4d2f423ef2119817)

  
Dec 2 (Reuters) - Chinese-made lidar sensors could expose the U.S. military to hacking and sabotage during a conflict, according to a Washington think tank report released Monday that calls for a ban on putting those sensors into American defense equipment. Lidar sensors use lasers to generate a digital three-dimensional map of the world around them. While most commonly found in driver-assistance systems in the automotive industry, they are also used in critical infrastructure such as ports, where they help automate cranes.

  
The U.S. military is also considering how to put the technology in autonomous military vehicles. But the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said in a [report, opens new tab](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/12/02/laser-focus-countering-chinas-lidar-threat-to-u-s-critical-infrastructure-and-military-systems/) that lidar sensors, typically connected to the internet, use advanced processors that could allow for the concealment of malicious code or firmware backdoors that are difficult to detect. Such ""hardware trojans"" could be exploited by China's government, which under Chinese law can force companies to comply with state security directives. Satellite-based laser systems could also be used to trip or disable such sensors in fractions of a second over broad swaths of U.S. territory, the foundation said. 

\*\*\*SEE REPORT PDF ABOVE:

Satellite-based laser systems could also be used to trip or disable such sensors in fractions of a second over broad swathes of US territory, the foundation said.

“While Chinese lidar sensors may be cheaper, the obvious long term costs of sabotage and surveillance far outweigh the savings,” Mr Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the foundation and one of the report’s authors, told Reuters.

The foundation recommended that US lawmakers ban the procurement of Chinese lidar in defence gear and that US state governments ban its use in critical infrastructure.

The think tank also recommended that US policymakers work with allied countries such as Germany, Canada, South Korea, Israel and Japan to create an alternative lidar supply chain to China.

While several prominent lidar suppliers such as Valeo, Luminar Technologies and Aeva Technologies are based in Europe or the United States, China has also become a major player in the industry with firms such as Hesai Group.

The US Department of Defence in October signaled it plans to put Hesai back on a list of companies it says work with the Chinese military. REUTERS



# NOV. 29th, 2024~US targets scrap to close the critical minerals gap

[Column: US targets scrap to close the critical minerals gap - Nickel](https://nickel.com/news/column-us-targets-scrap-to-close-the-critical-minerals-gap/)

The United States hasn’t had a tin smelter since 1991. That year marked the closure of the Longhorn plant in Texas, which was built with federal funds in 1942 to reduce the country’s import dependency at a time when tin cans quite literally fed the war effort.

Tin is still a critical metal, now for its use in circuit-board soldering rather than in preserved food, and the US government is once again considering how to reduce the country’s reliance on imports, currently running at 75% of annual consumption.

With no mines and no active reserves, the only way of closing the import gap is to recycle more.

The Department of Defense (DOD) has recently awarded $19 million to US secondary tin producer Nathan Trotter & Co. to expand domestic recycling capacity and capture more of the 38,000 metric tons of tin scrap that is exported every year.

Such recycling, or urban mining, is the often overlooked part of the critical minerals self-sufficiency equation.

# Urban mining

The DOD has also channeled funds to companies such as 6K Additive, which recycles titanium alloys, and Rare Earth Salts, which recovers terbium from old light bulbs.

The Department of Energy (DOE) will invest $22 million for an upgrade of Golden Aluminum’s recycling operations in Colorado and earmarked up to $270 million for enhanced copper recycling at Wieland’s Shelbyville facility in Kentucky.

The DOE is also looking to build from scratch an electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling chain. It has distributed funds for new processing capacity, new scrap sorting technology and, in the case of B2U Storage Solutions, even the transport of used batteries.

Urban mining has many advantages over primary mining and smelting. Recycling metals is cheaper than producing virgin metal because it requires much less energy, up to 90% less in the case of aluminum.

It is therefore also much “greener”, emitting 80% less greenhouse gas than primary metal, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) just-released special report on recycling.

Perhaps most importantly of all for US supply-chain planners, boosting domestic critical metals production by expanding recycling capacity means a much shorter permitting process than building new mines.

# Untapped potential

Recycling alone won’t replace the need for new mines but it can make a big difference, potentially reducing global demand for new mining activity by 25-40% by 2050 in a scenario that meets national climate pledges, according to the IEA.

However, urban mining’s full potential has yet to be fulfilled.

The share of secondary supply of copper in global demand, including direct melt scrap in products manufacture, fell from 37% in 2015 to 33% in 2023, the IEA said.

The share of recycled nickel decreased from 33% to 26% over the same period. Aluminum bucked the trend with an increase from 32% to 35% thanks to well-established waste management programs and supportive regulations, the IEA noted.

But the United States is a laggard with secondary copper accounting for just 30% of national consumption, lower than the global average.

The country is the world’s largest exporter of both copper and aluminum scrap, much of the outbound flow ending up in China.

The core problem is the hollowing out of US scrap processing capacity, particularly that needed to treat old end-of-life material that often needs meticulous sorting and dismantling before entering a remelt furnace.

A successful recycling economy also needs an efficient collection system, which is still lacking in the United States.

US recycling rates for aluminum cans, one of the easiest products to loop back into the supply chain, are below 50%, according to the US Aluminum Association. That means the equivalent of $800 million of valuable resource going to landfill every year, almost enough to build a new primary smelter.

# Battery challenge

Recycling EV batteries comes with a whole different set of challenges.

Extracting valuable metals such as nickel and cobalt from a spent battery can be a profitable business but what about batteries with none of those elements?

The EV battery sector has pivoted towards cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry in the last couple of years, such batteries now accounting for around 40% of the global market.

The relatively low value of the core metal inputs undercuts the economic case for recycling LFP batteries, meaning the sector may need to look at different pricing mechanisms such as toll-based recycling.

A global regulatory framework for recycling spent EV batteries is also still work in progress. Waste codes for black mass, the concentrated mixture of cathode and anode in a spent battery, vary widely by country and region.

Moreover, as the IEA report points out, China still dominates the middle processing stage of the supply chain, where recycled metals are fed back into precursor elements for new batteries.

Today the world’s top 20 companies for spent battery pre-treatment and materials recovery are Chinese, representing a new potential dependency for Western countries.

# Lead template

Most of the challenges can be overcome with the right policy mix, both at national and international level, according to the IEA.

A successful template for EV batteries and indeed all metals recycling is provided by the humble lead-acid battery. Recycling rates for what is classified as a health hazard can be as high as 99% in developed countries such as the US or in Europe.

The lead market still needs new mines but far fewer of them thanks to its high recycling rate.

As the US government is discovering, investing in new scrap processing capacity is far cheaper and greener than building new mines. Most importantly of all from a national security standpoint, the metal is also already captive in the domestic market.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLIONS ABOVE:



# NOTE:

# Niobium is not commonly mentioned as a primary material in the core components of LIDAR systems, but it can still play an important role in certain applications related to the technology. Here's how niobium might be relevant in the context of LIDAR:

# 1. Niobium in Sensors:

* **Niobium-based alloys** could be used in some sensor components due to their excellent **corrosion resistance**, **high melting points**, and **good conductivity**. These properties are valuable in maintaining the reliability and durability of LIDAR systems, especially in harsh environmental conditions.

# 2. Niobium in Electronics:

* Niobium is sometimes used in the manufacture of high-performance **superconducting materials** and **capacitors**. These materials are important in some advanced sensor and detection systems that may be integrated with LIDAR, especially in systems requiring high precision and stability. Niobium-based capacitors and components can provide the necessary electronic stability for LIDAR systems.

# 3. Niobium in Optical Components:

* **Niobium oxide** has potential applications in certain optical and laser technologies. While not the most common material for LIDAR lasers, niobium compounds might contribute to specialized optical components in very high-precision systems.

# 4. Niobium in Structural Components:

* **Niobium alloys** can also be used in the structural parts of LIDAR systems. Their combination of **strength**, **light weight**, and **resistance to heat** makes them useful in building durable, high-performance mechanical components that house sensitive LIDAR equipment.

# Conclusion:

While **niobium** is not one of the main materials specifically highlighted for LIDAR systems, it could play a role in specific advanced technologies or components within the system, particularly those requiring high performance, precision, or durability. However, its use is secondary compared to more critical minerals like rare earth elements, gallium, and silicon, which directly influence the core functionality of LIDAR.

# Scandium is another critical material that is not commonly cited as a core component in most LIDAR systems, but it can have some potential uses in specialized applications. Here's how scandium might be relevant to LIDAR technology:

# 1. Scandium in Laser Technology:

* **Scandium-based lasers**: Scandium can be used in the development of specialized **lasers** for LIDAR applications. Scandium can be part of certain **laser gain media**, particularly in the creation of **scandium-doped materials**. These materials can have specific optical properties that may enhance the performance of the lasers used in LIDAR systems. For example, **scandium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG)** is a known material that can be used in laser systems due to its ability to improve laser efficiency.

# 2. Scandium in Optics:

* **Scandium alloys**: Scandium is sometimes used in **alloys** to create lightweight and strong materials. When combined with aluminum, scandium forms alloys that are stronger, lighter, and more corrosion-resistant. This can be beneficial in the structural components of LIDAR systems, such as in **housing, mounts, or other mechanical parts** that need to withstand harsh environments while maintaining the precision of the optical components.

# 3. Scandium in High-performance Electronics:

* Scandium's **conductive properties** could potentially make it useful in the creation of **electronic components** such as **capacitors** or **superconducting materials**. These could be used in the electronic systems within LIDAR units to ensure stable and efficient operation.

# 4. Enhanced Material Properties:

* Scandium has been studied for use in **high-strength, lightweight alloys**, particularly in the aerospace industry. In the context of LIDAR, scandium’s inclusion in **metal alloys** could lead to more durable, heat-resistant, and lightweight components, especially in portable or aerial LIDAR systems mounted on drones or aircraft.

# Summary:

While **scandium** is not a major component in the primary functioning of LIDAR systems, its potential in **laser technology**, **high-strength alloys**, and **optical systems** makes it a useful material for specialized LIDAR applications. Its role in enhancing the performance, durability, and efficiency of components, especially in advanced and high-performance LIDAR systems, should not be overlooked. However, scandium remains secondary compared to other more widely used materials like **rare earth elements** (e.g., neodymium and dysprosium), **gallium**, and **silicon**.

* Belltopper is located within the gold prolific Bendigo Tectonic Zone in Victoria and approximately 50 km SSW of the high-grade world-class Fosterville Gold Mine.
* The Exploration Target was defined through geological modelling of priority target reefs following completion of 2024 drilling and the release of assay results.
* The Exploration Target excludes numerous emerging prospective zones and conceptual targets based on progressive geological and geochemical understanding.
* Evolving geology model provides multiple, high priority, drill-ready targets.
* Diverse range of mineralisation styles demonstrated by current work programs.
* Potential for Intrusion Hosted/Intrusion Related mineralisation and Fosterville-style, world-class, high-grade gold to be tested in forward drill programs.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Novo Resources Corp.** ( **Novo** or the **Company** ) (ASX: NVO) (TSX: NVO) (OTCQX: NSRPF) is pleased to provide an update regarding the Company’s highly prospective Belltopper Gold Project (“ **Belltopper** ”) in the Bendigo Tectonic Zone, Victoria (Figure 1). Integrating results from the current 2024 exploration program, the Company have an updated 3D model of priority target reefs at Belltopper, which has resulted in the definition of an Exploration Target.

An **Exploration Target** is now presented for the **Belltopper** area based on seven reefs considered to show high prospectivity based on geological, drilling, and historical data (Table 1).

***Clarification statement:*** *An Exploration Target as defined in the JORC Code (2012) is a statement or estimate of the exploration potential of a mineral deposit in a defined geological setting where the statement or estimate, quoted as a range of tonnes and a range of grade (or quality), relates to mineralisation for which there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource. Accordingly, these figures are not Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve estimates as defined in the JORC Code (2012). The potential quantities and grades referred to above are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource. These figures are based on the interpreted continuity of mineralisation and projection into unexplored ground often around historical workings. The Exploration Target has been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code (2012).*

Novo Executive Co-Chairman and Acting CEO Mike Spreadborough said:

*“Our Belltopper Project is an exciting, high-grade gold opportunity located in a tier-one gold region. The Novo geological team has done an outstanding job to define the geology, mineralisation and prospectivity of Belltopper supported by a successful period of work delivered at the Project, including the six-hole, 2,529 m, diamond drill program completed in Q2 this year. Belltopper is an exciting opportunity and has the potential to grow in size and scale and the focus will now turn to expanding the prospectivity of the project.”*

*Figure 1.* *Belltopper Gold Project location map with regional gold occurrences and major structures* 1 *.*

*The mineralisation presented in the body of this announcement is not necessarily representative of mineralisation throughout the Belltopper Gold Project. Intercepts are expressed as down-hole intersections and should not be presumed to represent true widths, which vary from hole to hole and between reefs (refer JORC Table 1). In addition, all references in this announcement to tonnage, grade, contained Au and associated ranges are expressed as approximations.*

*Certain results at Belltopper were obtained (and reported in accordance with Canadian continuous disclosure requirements) prior to the Company’s listing on ASX in September 2023 and are now reported to ASX in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 for the first time.*

Belltopper is located 120 km northwest of Melbourne and approximately 50 km south of Agnico Eagle’s Fosterville Gold Mine (Figure 1) in the Bendigo Zone, an area with historical gold production of more than 60 million ounces.

Novo recently completed a six-hole, 2,529 m, diamond drill program in Q2 2024 (see the Company’s ASX announcement dated 4 June 2024 released to ASX on 5 June 2024), commensurate with a re-logging and infill assay program on key historic holes. Recent campaigns build on previous drilling (2021 – 2022) and deliver new significant gold intercepts across a range of structural targets, including the discovery of two new gold reefs with significant strike potential.

The Company is focussed on developing a program that aims to grow the Exploration Target, whilst systematically testing an evolving pipeline of high priority, drill ready, conceptual shallow and deeper targets, including: Fosterville-style (epizonal), anticline related targets; Bendigo-style saddle-reef targets; Costerfield-style faults; and intrusive-igneous targets such as the gold-bearing Missing Link Granite, on theme with high-value Victorian examples of intrusion hosted deposits such as A1 and Morning Star in the Walhalla – Woods Point gold province, and developing projects such as Southern Cross Gold’s, Sunday Creek, 60 km north of Melbourne.

**BELLTOPPER EXPLORATION TARGET DEFINITION DETAIL**

A characteristic feature at Belltopper is the dense network of apparent high-grade gold ± antimony reefs that cluster in the northwest quadrant of the project adjacent to the regional Taradale Fault. An Exploration Target (Table 2) is presented for the Belltopper Project area based on seven individual reefs (Figure 2) considered to show high prospectivity based on geological, drilling and/or historical data outlined in Tables 3 and 4.

*\^ Selection criteria for the sub-set of seven reefs from the wider network of reefs at Belltopper considers both target confidence and target ounce potential, with the latter nominally set at >20,000 oz Au to be considered for inclusion into the Exploration Target.*

Figure 2 depicts significant intercepts returned across all phases of drilling. Callouts are provided for all >50 m.g/t Au 2 intercepts, and select intercepts from important target reefs, as well as the gold-bearing Missing Link Granite, a porphyritic felsic intrusion with IRGS (Intrusion Related Gold System) characteristics that outcrops centrally to the network of high-grade reefs at Belltopper. This Figure highlights the exceptional prospectivity and diverse nature of mineralisation present at Belltopper.

Reefs belonging to the Exploration Target are typically narrow, discrete, continuous structures that can be traced up to 1.5 km in strike and predominantly fall into two geometrical sets: a more common moderate to steep NE dipping set; and a less common subvertical to steep NW dipping set. Both sets are oblique to north-south trending stratigraphy and crosscut both stratigraphy and the regional upright folds. The reefs commonly manifest as narrow (<1 metre-wide), sulphide-rich fault breccia ± quartz vein occurrence or infrequently as multiple occurrences within a typically wider halo of intense sericite – silica ± kaolinite altered sediments and preserve textures and mineralogy consistent with the epizonal class of orogenic lode gold deposits (Figure 3).

Table 4 notes individual characteristics for each of the seven reefs included in the Exploration Target.

All reefs forming part of the Exploration Target have some degree of historic mining and/or exploration development, albeit minor on the Leven Star Reef. The most significant mining occurred on the historic Queens Birthday – Egyptian and O’Connor’s Reefs, where a combined production of ca. 90,000 oz Au at historical recovered grades of between 1-2 oz/t Au are reported 2

Reported historic mining grades are supported by recent exploration drilling data at Belltopper, including examples, but not limited to: the Queen’s Birthday Reef which returned **3.1 m @ 9.27 g/t Au** from 400.9 m, including **2.34 m @ 12.01 g/t Au** from 400.9 m in diamond hole MD20 3 ; and the Leven Star Reef which returned **14.0 m @ 6.15 g/t Au** from 120 m, including **7.60 m @ 6.66 g/t Au** from 121.9 m and **3.0 m @ 11.06 g/t Au** from 131 m in diamond hole MD16 5

The wide array of orientations for mineralised reefs *(i.e. mineralised structures)* at Belltopper is an important feature that has resulted in localised zones of structural and mineralisation overprint. Several of these overprinting zones have been modelled and are captured in the evolving pipeline of high-priority targets; including structural overprints along segments of the Exploration Target reefs that represent potential zones of enhanced gold mineralisation and opportunities to grow the Exploration Target (Figure 2).

Table 2 and Table 5 outline the Exploration Target, and the significant reefs included within the current Exploration Target at Belltopper.

**BASIS FOR THE BELLTOPPER EXPLORATION TARGET**

Novo applied its geological understanding of the reef network at Belltopper, drawing upon 3D reconstruction of historic mining (Figure 4) and exploration data, drilling data, structural and geochemical data, field mapping (including high-resolution LiDAR™ interpretation), and surface rock chip sampling. Tables 3 and 4 summarise key inputs into each reef.

Mineralisation volumes were defined from strike and dip continuity and potential modern “mineable width”. Continuity extents and width were based on geological interpretation and modelling by Novo (see Table 4 and Figure 2).

https://preview.redd.it/v43z0hs3ju3e1.jpg?width=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=046137881860ee2b7b33da47cf796d564fc9d9ae

*Figure* *4* *. Example from Novo's 3D Model, showing historical mine infrastructure, diamond drilling and assay callouts, beneath LiDAR™*

The Leven Star Reef (#1) was based on a 3D wireframe from drilling 6

The geological **continuity factor** allows for potential breaks in local geological continuity related to faulting or reef pinch-out. Values (all of which are approximations) averaged 0.85 for the High case and 0.75 for the Low case. A value of 1.0 was applied to the Leven Star Reef based on drilling information.

The **payability factor** acts to report *potential* “mineable tonnages” at a cut-off grade within the target zone, which averaged (approximately) 0.33 for the High case and 0.25 for the Low case. The payability for the Leven Star Reef was based on the percentage of estimation 6 blocks reported at a nominal underground mining cut-off of 2.7 g/t Au – which was approximately 0.25.

The **mine factor** accounts of any mining that has been undertaken within the target zone. Values applied range from approximately 0.5 for the Queens/Egyptian Reef (#5 in Figure 2) to 0.98 for the Leven Star Reef (#1 in Figure 2).

The Exploration Target is located within both oxide and fresh mineralisation. A weighted bulk density of approximately 2.65 t/m 3 was applied to both the High and Low cases to define mineralisation tonnages based on drilling information from the Leven Star Reef. No other bulk density data is available, and it is assumed that the Leven Star data represents other reefs.

The High and Low case Target Mineralisation Tonnages have been calculated using the following ( **Equation 1** ):

\*Strike continuity x dip continuity x mineable width x

geological continuity

x\*

payability

*x mine factor x bulk density*

Where the

underlined,

factors are different between the Low and High cases. The other factors were not changed as the CP/QPs considered that the geological continuity and grade payability factors provided enough variation in the context of a conceptual model – the Exploration Target.

Grade was assigned dominantly from historical data. For the Leven Star Reef, the Low grade was assigned from the block model 6 , and for the High case via a 10% upgrade. For the other reefs a base historical grade of 1 oz/t Au (31 g/t Au) was used. This grade was based on historical research which indicates recovered grades of 1-2 oz/t Au (31-62 g/t Au) 5

The historical reports for the Belltopper area provide no stope widths. Drive backs (roof) in sub-vertical to vertical reefs in Central Victoria were typically c. 3-4 feet wide (0.9-1.2 m), other than for very wide reefs and stockwork zones (e.g. some in Ballarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine, etc.). Based on underground observation of Central and Eastern Victorian narrow (<0.5 m) reefs (e.g. Bendigo; Cassilis, Inglewood, Tarnagulla, etc.), stopes were typically c. 2-3 feet wide (e.g. 0.6-0.9 m) 7

The following process has been applied to define a defendable and likely modern mining grade for the Exploration Target. For reefs #2-7, grade was assigned via the following steps:

The Target Mineralised Tonnage (defined via Equation 1) was domained into Marginal (MG) and High (HG) Grade zones using a nominal split of 30:70 (Low case) and 40:60 (High case). The MG mineralisation was assigned grades of 3 g/t Au (Low case) and 6 g/t Au (High case) respectively. This is based on research in other Central Victorian goldfields, reflecting the fact that the Target Mineralised Tonnage will not have a consistent high grade, but will include lower grade (MG) mineralisation that historically will have been mined and left as pillars.

HG material will have had some degree of hand sorting with material stacked in stopes underground. Sorting was not sophisticated and based on human activity, therefore the effect on grade may only be a 10-20% upgrade. The historical recovered grade of 31 g/t Au was factored to allow for some sorting. Values of 10% (High case) and 20% (Low case) were applied.

Thus with 20% sorting, the back-calculated “in-situ grade” is 25.4 g/t Au assuming all the reject material has a grade of 3 g/t Au.

The “in situ grade” is then proportionally combined with the HG to give the “target zone grade” which is an estimate of the in-situ grade that the historical miners would have mined. This however is at the “historical mining width” (HMW), not a modern mining width. The “in situ grade” needs to be diluted to approximate what we might mine today. The “target zone grade” has been diluted to a possible modern mining width of 1.5 m (Mineable width – see Equation 1) based on HMWs of 0.6 m (Low case) and 0.75 m (High case).

Once these factors are applied to the grade, the target grade results that is applied to the target mineralised tonnage to provide the contained ounces (Tables 2 and 5).

Novo believes that should mining be viable at Belltopper, an underground operation would be the most appropriate option. Operations could be led by the application of narrow vein mechanised mining and a selective stoping strategy, potentially using pre-concentration (e.g. ore sorting and/or gravity or flotation options) and shipping offsite for processing to minimise the local surface footprint. The mine access decline could be placed away from existing infrastructure and dwellings, etc. Any operation would be supported by good regional infrastructure and easy access to Melbourne. At this time there has been insufficient exploration to estimate Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves as defined *in the JORC Code (2012)* , and any decision to mine would be based on a feasibility study, including evaluation of all ESG matters.

The factors and grades used to support the Exploration Target evaluation, are based on reasonable assumptions by the CP/QP derived from historical research at Belltopper and other Victorian Goldfields. Consequently, the conceptual nature of the Exploration Target is re-emphasised, and the reader is referred to the “clarification statement” provided previously.

**EMERGING & CONCEPTUAL TARGETS**

Beyond the Exploration Target detailed above, Novo is optimistic about the potential of emerging and high priority mineralised trends such as Butchers Gully and the Welcome Fault.

The former is identified as a layer parallel fault to the Leven Star Fault (Figure 2) where recent results from re-logging and additional sampling of historical core by Novo returned **2.0 m @ 7.19 g/t Au from 52 m (incl. 1.15 m @ 12.01 g/t Au from 52 m) and 2.0 m @ 3.87 g/t Au from 43 m (incl. 1.0 m @ 6.92 g/t Au from 43 m)** in MD04 8

The Welcome Fault, discovered during Novo’s most recent diamond drilling program in Q1 2024 returned **4.1 m @ 2.37 g/t Au from 36.1 m** in hole BTD002 9 and is interpreted to trend parallel to the historically mined Hanover Reef (Figure 2). BTD002 is the only hole drilled into a developing priority target corridor identified by Novo and associated with a high-tenor IP chargeability anomaly.

In addition, several historically mined and/or developed reefs (e.g. #1 O’Connor’s group of reefs, Doctors group of reefs, Panama Reef, and West Panama Reef) were excluded from the Exploration Target, primarily based on calculated lower target ounce potential (<20,000 oz Au), or lower target confidence resulting from lack of historical mining data or current exploration data. Potential upside varies across individual reefs, though most are considered significantly underexplored.

Approximately 30% of the project area is covered by local younger basalt cover. Of note, some target gold reefs (e.g. O’Connor’s and Queens Birthday) are projected and demonstrated to extend beneath this cover. These extensions and potential additional reef occurrences provide opportunities for “blind” discoveries under the cover at Belltopper.

Refer to Appendix 3 for a full listing of all significant historic and recent gold intersections > 2 m.g/t Au returned on the Belltopper Gold Project to date.

Geology cross section 5880600 mN (Figure 5, looking north) highlights the Missing Link Granite as modelled by mapping and drill hole intersections. Several notable high-grade gold reefs are projected to intersect the Missing Link Granite, including emerging targets “NW Fault 4,” and “NW Fault 9,” from surface; and the Exploration Target “Missing Link,” reef at depth (Figures 2 and 5). These modelled intersections represent high-priority conceptual targets for fault-controlled intrusion-hosted mineralisation in damage zones either along the margins or internal to the Missing Link Granite.

Agnico Eagle’s Fosterville mine lies approximately 50 km to the north of the Belltopper Project, in similar Ordovician aged sediments and within the same gold-prolific Bendigo Tectonic Zone.

The fundamental characteristic of the worldclass Fosterville gold system responsible for the bonanza grade at the Swan and Phoenix deposits, include the interaction of steeply west dipping faults with the Fosterville Anticline in the footwall of the Fosterville Fault. The Fosterville Fault is a crucial structural feature that influences mineralisation. It trends NNW, dips steeply to the west, and is traceable for about 30 km. This fault, along with other parallel and cross-faults, plays a vital role in localizing gold mineralization within the deposit. The fault’s movement and associated deformation have created conditions favourable for gold deposition, making it an essential part of the geological story of the Fosterville gold system 10

Depicts key Exploration Target reefs and emerging gold reefs, in addition to structural features including the regional Taradale Fault and important anticline-syncline hinge zones. Conceptual targets for intrusion hosted mineralisation associated with projected intersections of key gold reefs with the Missing Link Granite, in addition to various emerging conceptual targets across anticline hinge zones are highlighted. Refer above regarding the basis for the Exploration Target. See also the “clarification statement” in reference to the Exploration Target above.*

Belltopper displays many of the fundamental characteristics important to the Fosterville gold-system, including the presence of a controlling regional mineralised structure (the Taradale Fault); a network of high-grade Au ± Sb reefs with epizonal characteristics; multiple occurrences of important gold-bearing west-dipping faults across the project; evidence for complicated linking and cross-faults; and critically, key regional fold hinges; including the highest-priority “Belltopper Anticline,” which hosts a gold-bearing porphyritic felsic intrusion, is spatially associated with the highest density of historic stoping; and hosts the strongest multi-element gold and pathfinder geochemical anomaly on the project. No assurance can be given that Novo will achieve similar results at Belltopper.

Several modelled and projected structural intersections between identified gold-bearing west-dipping structures and mapped anticline corridors provide both shallow and deeper conceptual targets to test for Fosterville-style, anticline-related mineralisation at Belltopper. With deeper conceptual targets also facilitating testing of hitherto-untested underlying stratigraphy and key mineralised structures at depth. Figures 5 and 6 highlight evolving shallow and deeper targets associated with key anticline corridors at Belltopper.

**FORWARD WORK PROGRAM**

Diamond drilling in design and planned for 2025 – 2026 is required to further validate the widths and tenor of gold mineralisation associated with individual reefs belonging to the current exploration target. An initial program with a minimum of two diamond holes per reef will target interpreted enhanced zones of mineralisation associated with key structural intersections on high-priority segments of each Exploration Target reef. Pending success, further drilling will be required to scope out each reef to the nominal depths as indicated in Table 4.

Concurrently, Novo is developing exploration programs to build on recent success with emerging reef discoveries, as well as drilling programs designed to test the higher-priority conceptual shallow and deeper targets that are continuously evolving on the project, with a strong focus on exploring for world class, Fosterville-style, anticline related targets, which are considered the highest priority targets at Belltopper (Figure 7).

Shallow intersections of key west-dipping structures (e.g. Big Reef, Queens Birthday #2, and O’Connor’s No.1 Far West) with the Belltopper Anticline occur within areas of historic mine stoping on the O’Connor’s Reef on this section and are considered an important control on high-grade mineralisation for Exploration Target reefs such as O’Connor’s.

How Maqbool Bhat Escaped Prison.,Kashmiri,1h2lgdk,2024-11-29 08:10:21,16,0.83,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kashmiri/comments/1h2lgdk/how_maqbool_bhat_escaped_prison/,GYRUM3,ａｚａｄｉｗａｖｅ,"##ESCAPE HERE – REARREST THERE/THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MAQBOOL BHAT (PART ONE) BY WANDE TEAM/WANDE MAGZINE

**One Kashmiri, Abdullah Dar succumbed to perks of the state and turned into a Government witness, he was later used to persecute Maqbool and his friends. Maqbool, along with his two associates, were tried in a Srinagar court headed by Neelkanth Ganjoo for killing Amarchand, crossing the LOC illegally, and being an enemy agent under Enemy Act 1943, the case went on for almost two years and the verdict was given in August 1968. Maqbool Bhatt and Mir Ahmed were given a death sentence but Kala Khan was sentenced to life imprisonment.**

**When Maqbool was asked if he had anything to say in his defense, he said, ""I have no problem in accepting the charges leveled against me, except one. I am not an enemy agent (agent of Pakistan) but I am the enemy itself. Have a good look at me and recognize me well, I am enemy of your illegal rule in Kashmir... There is no rope that can hang Maqbool.”**

**An IB officer who had interrogated Maqbool after his arrest had said that almost the entire interrogation team was impressed by his clarity of thought, including Maoism.**

**The case went on for about two years and in August 1968 they were sent to the Bagh-e-Mehtab interrogation center and but the fire was yet to die down. To buy some time, Maqbool Bhat appealed against the court decision while he and his friends started planning an escape and, within a month and a half, managed to do the same. In the bone-chilling winter of December 1968, he walked hundreds of miles on foot and crossed the LOC 'illegally' once again back to his base camp.**

**Maqbool Bhatt later wrote in great detail about the escape and submitted the file before the Special Trial Court in Pakistan where he was tried along with other NLF members for ‘Ganga’ hijacking. A brief account of the escape is included here from one of his interviews in 1972:**

>Freedom lovers have always tried to break the walls that cage them, it’s even more important in a guerrilla fight. Our escape was no coincidence, we didn’t just see an opportunity and took it. Right from the time they put the shackles on me, I was thinking of ways to escape. I knew if I had to finish what I had started I would have to escape no matter what. I decided not to take help from anybody outside as it would put their lives in danger too, their allegiance had to remain a secret for now. We were kept separate from other prisoners, our area was called Zanaan Khana/Zanana Jail and during the autumn of 1967, we were joined by Zul Zamaan, Jamus Khan and Ghulam Yasin. All of them were from Azaad Kashmir and had crossed over to IOK during the 1965 war. Yasin had been arrested for spying for Pakistan. After getting to know them, our team grew, we were six now (Kala Khan, it seems, was being held in the other wing), Jamus and Zamaan lived in the second cell. Our cell had Room A and Room B, Room B was divided into 3 sections, kitchen, toilet and washroom. Four guards would still always stay outside to keep a watch. One had a machine gun and the other three were armed with rifles, all of them were from the BSF. We divided our escape plan into three steps. First, we had to improve our relationship with the prison administration by acting naive and making them believe that we mean no harm

>We would even smile whenever they tried to instigate a reaction. Second, we had to get friendly with the prison Administration, most of them were Muslims who identified with us. Slowly and one by one, we explained to them how we were not arrested for looting or stealing as the state and its propaganda says but for demanding freedom for Kashmir. We told them we wanted Kashmiris to rise and they could only rise after Azaadi.

>We soon found a support base who identified and would work for us among them, they would do minute tasks and carry our messages. We also used to get Indian Express, Aftab and a few cigarettes during the evening. The prison administration would censor much of the stuff in the newspapers. In winters, we were supplied with a Kashmiri bukhāri, which also helped us in our escape later on. The prison building was pretty old, it had soil plastered on stones not wider than a brick. On 21 August 1968, I filed an appeal against my death penalty in from of the Chief Justice of Indian occupied Kashmir. It was 300 lines long (The appeal is missing from the High-Court records). After my appeal, our wooden doors were replaced by iron doors, our walls were fixed and coloured with white, we demanded a bulb but it was rejected as “people under death sentence aren’t allowed such privileges” but they would leave a lantern near the prison bars. We asked for a 6-inch nail to hang our clothes and a place to put our Quran on. We were being chained even while roaming around the prison grounds and even when we went to the bathroom.

>In October 1968, we started putting our plan into action. The appeal was going on while I was gathering information from my sources inside the prison. I came to know that our wall was just 8 feet away from the prison walls, outside which was a field where vegetables used to grow. Many prisoners used to be taken there for work during the summers. There were no guards in the field during winter so it seemed to be the best time for escape. The second cell was at the end of the jail (where Pakistani citizens were held) was the end of the jail, it’s an eastern wall made up of bricks and at least 3 feet wide but the one opposite to the bars were weaker and made up of stones. We used one of its rooms as our storeroom where we would keep our things (mattresses/blankets etc). My sources told me that it would be comparatively easier to break through a stonewall than through the brick one. We decided to open a hole between the two cells first so that we can move easily.

>As the winters came, we noticed our walls were turning wet, so we covered them with blankets up to 2.5 feet in height. When questioned about our actions we simply said that our clothes were getting dirty and wet walls were making the cells colder. As we had already won their trust, they believed it. I complained to the jail administration that our jails were too open for such a brutal winter. I asked for permission to cover them from the floor to a few feet height with blankets, to which they again agreed. At evenings, I used to stay near the blankets, as if trying to find some light to read my newspapers but in reality, I was keeping an eye while my friends were doing their work. We used the 6-inch nail to dig the wall and hid the mud and stones under our mattresses. This was done so slowly that even the guard roaming outside our cell wouldn’t hear anything. No newspaper meant no digging. We soon managed to create a hole big enough to pass by through, it took us eight days.

>The wall was covered with blankets so the guards wouldn’t smell anything fishy whenever they peaked in during the day. As we couldn’t crossover to the second cell until everybody slept, we changed the timing of our digging. To dig the wall for our escape, we found 12 am-2 am a preferable time to work. I would still go the prison bars to read my newspaper order to minimize any chance of suspicion and we all would fake sleep till 12. Around 12:00 am every day, Ghulam Yasin would cross over to the other cell and start his work. I would use blankets from the store to make a dummy in order to make sure he would seem to be sleeping from the outside if anybody came to check. It took us almost two weeks to finish working on this wall. Now, we had to create a hole in the main wall which surrounded the whole compound. We used the iron and wood from our Bukhari to do this job but suddenly one day our guard changed.

>These new guards were from the CRPF. They didn’t even speak Urdu or Hindu but only English and Tamil. We found it easier to impress them and I even learned a bit of Tamil from them. These poor souls were from the plains and the winters of Kashmir were too harsh for them. They would light a big Bukhari during the night, surround it, make tea and talk, thinking that we all were deep asleep. They would have not even in their wildest dreams thought what we were up to. On 17 November 1968, the Indian government decided to convert all death sentences into life sentences in respect of the 20th death anniversary of the Mahatma Gandhi that was soon about to be celebrated. Next day, the Jail staff visited to congratulate and informed us that we shall be soon shifted to the normal cells. We had already finished 3/4th of our work, so changing our cells would have exposed our secret. We told them that every cell was the same for us and we were still on the death sentence till the official order came. Even our guards weren’t happy with the general actions of the Indian state. I used to discuss and share news from Madras with them and that would make them extremely happy. During the third week of November, Ramadan started and we were given some relaxation.

>Our Pakistani friends would come into our cell during the day (legally) and we would pray together. After the prayers, I would recite the Quran to them and talk about Jihad against falsehood so that they wouldn’t lose hope. One day, Mir Ahmed returned with red eyes and deep breaths, he said, “Maybe Allah doesn’t want our Azaadi, there is a huge stone blocking our way out. We can’t close the holes neither can we get away. What should we do now, Maqbool?”. I told him to have faith and start digging around the edges of the stone. When the edges became weak, the big stone took just around 15 minutes to dispose of. I cannot explain the smile on his face when he came back! He hugged me and kissed my forehead, it was around 2. The guards came as they always would around this time during Ramadhan to order Yasin to make Sehri for us. We explained the plan of escaping on the same night to Yasin after the guards went away to warm themselves. Mir Ahmed was the first to cross, then Yasin and then me. We thought about our brothers, who refused to come with us. They didn’t believe we would be able to escape, forget cross over to Azaad Kashmir during such a harsh winter. They said it was impossible, that it was a suicide, but we had made our mind. We again requested them to join us but they declined. I think they were scared, very scared. We took some food, a packet of cigarettes and my legal documents with us and left.

>It was the 9th of December 1968 and around 2:30 am when we escaped. We reached the mountains of Badamwari and crossed a river. The winter was bone-chilling, only the thirst of Azaadi and the strength of our Emaan kept us going. We would deliberately cross rivers rather than going around them as we knew police (with their trained dogs) would soon be looking for us. It took us 16 days to reach to the first border check post of Azad Kashmir. We didn’t contact our sympathizers in Indian Occupied Kashmir because we knew they would be facing the brunt of the state after our escape. We also knew crackdowns would be happening all over Kashmir. We would walk through apple orchards to escape sight while eating our eggs and rotis. Every day at around 4 am, guards usually interchanged their positions in the prison. After the change, they would check on the prisoners from outside to see if everything was going alright, but we weren’t there anymore. The countermeasures should have started by now. The sun was coming up, so we took up to the mountains and hid there till it was dark again.

>At around 2:00 am on the 10th of December, it started to snow but we couldn’t stop. Our feet were freezing and we lost the way, but we still kept going as stopping was no option. It had snowed only on the mountains till now, so we found a cave and warmed ourselves there, then we came down and continued our journey through the plains. We soon found a lonely village, right in the middle of nowhere. On the outskirts of it, we found a small hut. The inhabitants were poor, so we asked only for a place to rest. Treating us as his own, the owner told us to sit near the Dambur and served tea. He told us about a dream he had had yesternight, in which a divine figure had appeared to him and informed him about the coming of a few guests who should be taken great care of. Even though he was a shepherd, he makes sure we got everything we needed. Our feet were washed with warm water. My companions slept but I kept talking to my host till we had Sehri. This place was somewhere in Alasteng, the same place Srinagar gets its electricity from. We soon left for Ghanderbal, it was a highly militarised area but to our good-luck, it was also raining profusely and due to heavy fog, nobody could see beyond about 50 feet.

>We again took refuge in a lonely house to dry our clothes and to warm ourselves by acting as businessmen from Residency Road, Srinagar who had come to the area for hunting. Our host asked me if I could help him with a land-grabbing case going on at the Srinagar High Court, I replied affirmatively.

>During our stay, Ahmed Rather (our host) instructed us to be careful as the army and the CRPF had started strict checking of all roads leading to and from Srinagar and were harassing people, even the women weren’t spared. I acted surprised and asked him why all this was happening.

>“Don’t you know? Mujahideen have escaped from Srinagar. They were being kept there since long, some were even on the death sentence… Not only army, even CID is looking for them, but they are nowhere to be found”, he said.

>We then started to talk about the Mujahideen of 1965. I told him how I had helped the Mujahideen during those years (which is a fact) and he was highly impressed. I asked him, “I have heard that a lot of Mujahideen were working in this area. Is it true?”, He sighed and said, “Yes, it’s true. They were working here, some even saw them but I never did, how I wish I would have seen one.” I changed the subject and asked about his personal life. He was a farmer, who during his youth also used to deliver supplies to Srinagar, Gurez, Asur, Poji, and Gilgit. “But these are the stories of old times, now the LOC has divided our country. I can’t go there nor can they come here,” he added. I then told him that I wanted to discuss something of grave importance with him alone. He took me to the third floor of his home and we sat on a Patij. I asked him if he was in the state of Wuduh and he replied with a yes.

>I then took out the Panch-Surah which I always used to carry with me out from my pocket and asked him to keep his hand on it and promise me that he would not share the secrets I was about to reveal with any other living soul. After his promise, I told him we were the same Mujahideen who had escaped from Srinagar. His face brightened up, and his eyes turned bloodshot. I don’t think I can really explain his emotions at that time. He began crying, kissing my hands and hugging me. He ran down to the first floor and spread a new carpet, opened his Almirah and also took out his new blankets and mattresses. From now on, we were told to stay in this room. He then went to the kitchen and asked his wife to cook chicken. Rather than Tyoth, preparations for Kehwa began too.

>The old man ordered his daughter to go to the main village and get her brother (Habib) home too. At the time of dinner, food was brought to the first floor. I could see on the face of his wife how proud she was for getting a chance to cook for us (Mujahideen), but only men ate at our table while the women ate separately. Within a few hours, we turned from strangers to their most beloved guests. They made sure we had no complaints about our stay. We told them we had to leave in the middle of the night and Habib offered to guide us as far as he could.

>On 12 December 1968, at around 1:00 am, I and my friends woke up and found the old man still awake and waiting. He woke up his family and asked them to prepare a meal while he went to get some fruits and a few kilograms of rice for us from his orchids which we would need during our journey. We refused to take anything but were forced to accept. With a heavy heart and a lot of blessing, Baba bade us farewell. In the dim moonlight, we left for our destination with Habib.

>Habib was well-informed about the area and helped us skip checkpoints with ease. After an hour of walk, Habib told us that he didn’t know what lay beyond, so we bade him farewell. Before leaving, I had written a letter attributed to Sheikh Nazir of the Plebiscite Front for our hosts, I wrote to him about our escape and asked him to help Habib and his family in their case going on in the High Court. I had met Sheikh Nazir during our imprisonment at the Srinagar Jail.

>We took to the mountains and crossed a few rivers and reached another village. The river divided the village into two parts. On the banks of it was a Masjid, we prayed Nafl there and resumed our journey. After reaching the Sumbal-Ganderbal road intersection we started walking towards Sumbal. We reached yet another village where people were leaving for Fajr prayers. A man saw us and greeted us with the Islamic greeting, he asked us who we were and I answered saying that I was the forester from a nearby village on my way to Sumbal with my colleagues. Foresters are not seen as a direct part of occupying force in Kashmir, so people go easy on them.

>Coincidentally, Mohammad Akhoon (our host) had just built a new house and needed wood for it. He requested us to stay with him for a few hours so that we could rest. The sun was coming up, we also were in need of a place to stay, so we agreed. He took us to his newly built house, they hadn’t moved in yet but preparations were in place. We decided to sit there rather than going to his old house because it was easier to keep an eye on the village from this location. Akhoon went home and came back with tea. While he was gone, I had ordered my friends not to unpack anything and be ready to move while staying at the window. One cannot be sure of anything.

>After coming back and noticing our uneasiness, Akhoon asked me why we wouldn’t even take our shoes off? I, acting as a forester, authoritatively ordered him to not talk about useless matters with us but he kept insisting. We removed our shoes and sat comfortably.

>I asked him about his family. Akhoon had a wife, and a daughter who had been married recently. By morning, the news of our escape had reached here too. Akhoon told me how the forces were looking everywhere to find the escaped Mujahids. My eyes fell on a sewing machine and I learnt that Akhoon was a part-time tailor. I used his scissors and the sewing machine to make a pair of gloves from a piece of my blanket that I had taken along from the jail.

>I found Akhoon to be very supportive and the same as I had done with Baba, I made him place his hand on the Quran and promise to protect our secrets. Akhoon wanted to run back home and get more food for us after he heard the truth but I refused. When his son-in-law came to check on us, Akhoon went to get the dawat (invitation) he was planning all along. He ordered his son-in-law to look after us and not to leave us alone in case we needed anything. Akhoon requested me if he could bring his daughter in to meet us too. He wanted her to see the Mujahideen. I skipped his requests multiple times, but he wouldn’t give up so we agreed to see his daughter. She and her husband later left for their home after meeting us.

>Akhoon provided us with a guide who was extremely happy for getting a chance to guide the Mujahideen. He also got some sugar, tea, cigarettes, and kulchas from for us which we might need on the way. We left at around 7:00 pm.

>We walked on the road to Sumbal for some time but later went into the cornfields. Electric polls were directing us towards other villages. After two hours of walking, I asked my guide to return, he insisted on coming with us until we reached Sumbal but I refused stating that his family would be waiting for his return.

>After waiting for a few minutes, we changed our path. It was not a sudden change; it was our plan all along (this was done to fool the authorities in case somebody snitched). After walking for a few more hours, we reached the Mansbal lake. To our left was a big village with bright lights. We found two houses on the outskirts, but both were empty. While we were discussing our plan ahead, the electricity went out in the village. We decided it was safer to go into the village now but we couldn’t just knock at any house and be mistaken for thieves. I told my companions to keep their eyes and ears open and look for a house where people were still awake. While walking, we heard a man coughing on the second floor of his wooden godown. These godowns always have a room where the owner can stay and is usually built near one’s own house.

>I ordered my companions to stop and knocked at the window with a long stick. There was no answer for the first time, but when I knocked again, he asked us who we were and what did we want at this time. In a hushed-up voice, I told him that we were no strangers and asked him to open the window so we could talk. He opened the window and again asked us about our business there. “We are Musafirs from Sumbal and want to go to a village a little far from here, we are very tired and want to take some rest”, I said politely. He pointed at a Masjid nearby and asked us to go there and rest as much as we wanted to. I told him that it wasn’t possible for us to go there, had it been possible we wouldn’t have come to him in the first place.

>He allowed us to come in. He then lit his lantern and looked at us carefully. “Oh, so it is you, people! I am so happy to meet you. Now I understand why you don’t want to go to the Masjid. You are the Mujahideen everybody is looking for!”, exclaimed the 25-years-old young man. We told him that we wouldn’t have disturbed him in the middle of the night like this, but it was extremely necessary for us to cross the lake somehow. “Consider it done, if you want, I can be of more help. We are always ready to make sacrifices for our Mujahideen, but first you should take some rest,” he replied.

>He extinguished the light and talked to us about the Mujahideen. He told us about his younger brother who was studying in a college nearby and how he would love to see us. I asked him to make the arrangements for our crossing, but he wanted us to have Sehri with him first. We went to his house, where we also met his brother who was really happy to meet us. All of us together had our Sehri with rice and fishes. We also listened to the radio to catch some news. After we were done, both the brothers helped us cross the river and joined us until we reached the Sumbal-Bandipora road. I asked them to return from there. I don’t remember their names, but they belonged to the Wagay caste.

>On 13 December 1968, we again walked non-stop till we reached Sadarkot. We could hear the sound of Duroods being hummed from the Masjids. It was almost morning. We crossed Sadarkot and again started looking for a place to stay. A mile away from Sadarkot, we found a few isolated houses. We decided to either stay in the jungles nearby or stay in one of the houses. When we reached the last house, we knocked on its door and a young boy came out. He told me that his father was still at the Masjid.

>I told him that we were his father’s guests and wanted to meet him. He guided us inside and introduced himself as Ghulam Rasool. After around 15 minutes, his father returned and sat near me and asked us who we were and where we were from. I told him that we had come here for hunting and wanted to cross the mountains ahead. While we were talking, I also told him that I was a schoolmaster by profession. So, to test his sons' progress, he requested me to ask him a few questions. The father was himself uneducated but had left no stone unturned to educate his son. I ordered Ghulam Rasool, a 9th class student to come closer and asked a few questions. After some time, much to the relief of his father, I told him that his child was good at studies and would pass his exams with ease. Now, he wanted me to examine hi10-year-old daughter too. She was a student of the Qu’ran. She was a bit weak in her studies so I had to correct her from time to time. Hearing my Tilawat (recitation), the father asked me where I had learnt it from but I asked him why was he interested in knowing where I had learnt to recite the Qu’ran in such a manner.

>“Your recitation reminds me of the old times, the time when our country wasn’t divided. I was a young man then, working in Punjab. The Mullahs there have a tone much similar to yours.”, he said. I told him that I had got my religious knowledge from Punjab itself. He then began to share his experiences of living in Punjab. While discussing different topics, we also took up Kashmir’s politics. After getting positive answers from him, we revealed our real identity to him too. He too was extremely happy to host us and did whatever he could to make our stay comfortable. One of us would stay at the door and keep an eye on the surroundings while others would rest. Our host told us that the whole of Bandipora had been turned into a garrison after our escape. Various check-points had been set up and raids were taking places everywhere. Sensing danger, we decided to change our course. At the evening, I asked our host if he could find for us a guide who could help us reach the Sonawari Tehsil through Jehlum. He sent his son to the surrounding houses who came back with 3 more people. Out of them, Ghulam Ahmed Khan volunteered to go with us. After our dinner, we left at around 9:00pm and reached Chandaregare. Here, our guide took us to his son-in-law’s house.

>Here, we met two more people, Salam and Sana-ullah Sheikh. They informed us that crossing through the river into Sonawari was not safe anymore as CID officials in civilian clothes had been installed near the banks of the river, but at the same time, they also promised us that they would find a way till morning. We stayed at their house for the night. I warned them not to snitch on us, else we would burn the whole house down with everybody in it. One of us would always stay awake while the others slept to keep an eye. After our Sehri, Ahmed Khan bade us farewell and informed us that he would return by noon with some details.

>In the morning, Sana-ullah gave us a transistor to listen to the radio. At around 7:00 am in the morning, Sana-ullah too bade us farewell as he had to mark himself present at his office. He promised to come back as soon as possible. I told him to also get details about the presence of the enemy forces around the area. Salam had volunteered to take us to Sopore undetected.

>At around 2:00, Sunaah-ullah returned with the newspaper Aftab. It carried a news of our escape and the repercussions faced by the officials on duty there (Extra detail – At least 24 employees including the Superintendent and his Deputy were dismissed. Two among them identified as Ghulam Qadir Khan and Muhammad Amin Zarger were taken into custody and severely tortured in Kothibagh Police Station for 17 days. They were shifted to Joint Interrogation Centre (JIC), Hari Niwas, and after a month shifted to Coimbatore Jail in Tamil Nadu. After a year, Ghulam Qadir Khan and Muhammad Amin Zarger were released on parole. However, they were required to present themselves before the investigating authorities once a week. Later the court ordered their release and reinstatement. However, severe torture had adversely affected Ghulam Qadir’s nerves. He turned mentally ill and died without hearing the good news of his reinstatement). A little while later, Ghulam Mohammad Khan and Salam joined us too. Everybody shared the information they had been able to gather. Salam had already arranged a boat for us which would lead us into the jungle, crossing which would land us in Sopore. We decided to leave in the evening.

>After our journey through the boat, We, Sana-ullah, Salam and our boatman reached Mugdambagh, a village of fishermen/women. We knocked at a one-storey hut, but the owner refused to open the door fearing we might be thieves. Only after a few minutes of persuasion did he agree to open the door. We asked for his help and offered to pay, but he refused to go out before the sunrise. His wife was suffering a mental disorder, and she thought she was possessed by a Jinn/Ghost. I read from the Quran and blew on her. She considered our coming as a sign of good luck. At about 6 in the morning, we said goodbye to our friends and got into the old man’s boat to continue our journey.

>It took us about 3 hours to reach our destination, Sangar. Sangar is the same hill where the tomb of Baba Shukuruddin is located. From this hill, all of Zaingeer and Sonawari is visible. After walking for about 4 hours, we reached an apple orchid and decided to take some rest there till the sun dusked upon us. I sent Mir Ahmed to the village where one of our friends, Abdul Rehman Mir lived. After finding him at home, we decided to meet. Here, we also met Maqbool Mir, a farmer from Kupwara. He invited us to stay at his place for the night and we agreed.

>In the morning, we sent Maqbool Mir to check out the security footprint in the area while Abdul Rehman got supplies and equipment for our journey ahead. He also provided us with bandages and sheep-hides to walk through the snow. Here, people would cover their legs up to their shins with the hides and tie grass-ropes around them to keep them in place. Strips of cloth were also tied from their ankles to their knees to make it air-proof. This was the only way to survive the snow coming ahead. We left after some rest.

>On 17 December, after walking for a few hours, we reached Baramulla through Rafiabad and took shelter in the woods. We decided to go to Qazinag, it was a difficult route but we had no other option. Ghulam Yasin remembered these woods, it was through these woods he was able to return to Azaad Kashmir during the Operation Gibraltar. We had also heard that not only Police and CID, but also Chowkidars and Numberdars were warned against helping any unknown individuals. Huge banners with our pictures had also been set up at many places warning people of at least 7 years of imprisonment if they dared to help us and a reward of ₹10,000 if they passed any information leading to our capture. We were on our way towards Nowgam through the dense jungle and soon reached areas covered with snow. When it was almost dark, we found a place to rest and started a fire to keep us warm.

>On 18 December 1968, we started out for Qazinag Galli, our pace slowed down as the weather kept getting colder and snow more dense. After reaching Qazinag at around 2:00 pm, we found an abandoned hut and took some rest there. These huts belonged to the Bakarwal community who brought their animals to these areas during the summers.

>Now, we had to climb the snow mountains ahead. At places, we would be inside the snow up to our waists, but we continued climbing until it was almost dark. Dabritop was our next destination. My companions were tired and wanted to rest, but I didn’t want anybody to stop as we hadn’t covered much distance due to our slow pace. Ration was also running out. We kept walking to the top under the dim moonlight. At around 2:00am, we found a small plateau near the top with another abandoned hut on it. We went inside, ate and slept.

>On 19 December 1968, as the dawn was upon us, we picked up bags and resumed our journey to the top. After reaching to the top at around 10 am, we knew this was the spot after which we could no longer see the valley, so we decided to stay there for a moment. I looked back at my motherland but couldn’t see anything. As far as my eyes went, everything was covered with clouds. It was due to these clouds that I couldn’t see this heart-alluring, beautiful nation of mine whom I had chose to live and die for. We started our descent. The snow had frozen during the night, making it easier for us to walk on it. Our plan now was to reach a jungle before dusk. After walking for some time, I saw a forest to my left but while coming down, Mir Ahmed slipped, I still remember how I dig my hiking pole into the snow and grabbed him. When we reached the forest, we found an abandoned bunker. Inside it were only a few letters in Hindi and some utensils. This meant that we were somewhere near the LOC. We stayed for the night.

>On 20 December 1968, we resumed our journey. The mountain we were about to cross was so hard to trek that even after a day of climbing, we couldn’t reach the top. We found a small forest midway, got some Birch bark to keep us warm and took rest but it wasn’t comfortable enough to get any sleep. We again resumed our journey in the morning. At around 2:00 pm, we crossed over the mountain, but I had already met with an accident. While climbing, I had slipped and fallen down into a river. My hand was also injured but as the temperature was below zero there wasn’t much blood loss. We soon reached Satsari. Now in front of us was a river, which people of Azaad Kashmir call Chumb-nala. We took rest for the night and walked on the banks of it for the next day as it led to mainlands of Azaad Kashmir. The snow was decreasing but our feet had had enough of the frostbites, cramps, and injuries (from our handcrafted boots), but we couldn’t take the boots off due to the fear of infection. Whenever we would stop to warm ourselves, the pain would increase due to the increased flow of blood. Mir Ahmed’s condition was the worst. I don’t think he even slept for a moment during that night. But what could we do except console him?

>On 23 December 1968, at around 12:00 PM, we had almost reached our destination, but Mir Ahmed refused to go any further. He was trembling with pain and wanted us to leave him behind. As our attempts at motivating him failed, I started to mock and taunt him so as to make him change his mind. I also took his bag and put his arm around my neck to help him walk. When we had to climb, I would carry him on my back. Had all this been not done, I am sure he would have died.

>We soon found a man wandering in the jungle and asked him if this was Azaad Kashmir to confirm our belief. He replied with a yes and took us to his home after hearing our story. This was a day after Eid. How our Eid went, you already know. We will celebrate our Eid the day Kashmir is free.

>We were hungry since the last three days, Shah Mohammad (our host) cooked some rice and potatoes as fast as he could to feed us. We removed our shoes and they washed our blood-soaked feet. As the house was too small to host us all, Shah Mohammad asked his friend Muhammad Yaqoob to host me and Yasin. We asked Shah to bring Mir Ahmed to us in the morning. Yaqoob’s family took great care of us. People gather around us and congratulated us for our hard earned freedom.

>On December 24, 1968, Shah Muhammad brought Mir Ahmed to us. The news of our arrival had spread far and wide already. People were coming to congratulate us. We now had to go to a checkpost, but didn’t have the strength to walk further. People of Azad Kashmir carried us on their backs and walked for at least 2 hours till we reached the checkpost. Here, a Subedaar welcomed us and offered tea. The news of our coming was then forwarded to his senior officers. I talked to a Force Commander who was stationed at another check point. He assured me that he will report our coming to his seniors too, and whenever a decision is taken we would be informed. I talked to the Subedaar for the next two hours while Mir Ahmed and Ghulam Yasin talked to the other soldiers. We were then taken to the Chinari Batallion Headquarters. By the time we reached there, it was snowing there as well. From there, we were directed towards Sawankhuch. The snow was almost 9-inch high by now. I thanked Allah for the weather that had remained almost constant during our crossover, had it been any different, we would have perished.

>Next day, we were served food in the military mess and while talking to a few officers, one of the GCOs (General Officer Commanding) of FIU (Federal Intelligence Unit) came inside the camp and started questioning us. The military doctors took great care of us nonetheless. It had been ages since I had shaved or even washed my face with warm water. Next day, the GCO returned with a jeep and took us to Muzaffarabad. In Muzaffarabad, we were taken to The Black Fort and handed over to the 611 Field Investigation Unit. This is where our running which had started from our prison cell finished. This was our victory and the defeat of our enemy who was much more powerful than us, whose resources were infinite and who was always keeping an eye on the oppressed people. This victory gave birth to new hopes and dreams in my heart. It strengthened my belief and love for my nation. What more could a man who was on a death sentence wish for? I thought I would be going back to my family but my dreams were short lived. My experiences at the Black Fort shook me to the core and my mind started running. It became difficult to differentiate between my enemy and my ‘friend’. "

Eu in principal trollez, nu imi pasa nici de o parte nici de cealalta, imi pasa doar de mine.

Dar cateoadata si eu ma cruceam de cat de departe va puteti duce unii.  Toată lumea sare să zică Rusia, conspirații, interferențe externe și alte lucruri de genul ăsta.

Sigur, sună bine, e comod, dar haideți să vedem de ce cred eu că Călin Georgescu a ajuns așa sus pe val. Pe scurt? Stânga progresistă l-a făcut popular, intr-o mare masura. Și o să explic.

1. Știi cum e să te simți constant judecat?Oricine are o opinie mai conservatoare despre familie, religie sau chiar ceva legat de UE e imediat catalogat drept înapoiat, intolerant sau, mai rău, extremist. Te-ai săturat de asta? Fix aici vine Georgescu și zice: ""Nu sunteți voi de vină, sunteți doar ignorați!"" Și dintr-o dată, omul devine eroul celor care simt că stânga le închide gura.
2. „Corectitudinea politică” dusă la extremÎți amintești câți oameni au fost „anulați” pe rețelele sociale sau în spațiul public pentru opinii mai tradiționale? Sau pentru că au spus ceva ce nu se aliniază perfect cu narativul progresist? Ei bine, când îi faci pe oameni să se simtă marginalizați, aceștia caută lideri care „le dau voce.” Ghici cine a luat steagul ăsta și a alergat cu el? Georgescu.
3. Îndepărtarea de problemele realeCând discuțiile sunt dominate de teme precum drepturile globale, ecologie radicală sau corectitudinea politică, mulți români simpli — care abia își plătesc facturile — simt că vocea lor nu contează. Georgescu apare și spune fix ce vor să audă: „Trebuie să ne întoarcem la problemele noastre, la valorile noastre!” Și uite așa, îl urmează oameni care n-ar fi fost interesați de el altfel.

Deci, să fim serioși: Georgescu nu e doar un produs al campaniilor sale. E și un efect secundar al polarizării extreme și al felului în care progresismul tratează orice altă opinie. Iar cât timp oamenii vor continua să fie alienați și împinși spre margine, liderii de genul lui vor continua să urce.

Campania sa s-a bazat pe ideea că ""România are nevoie de un lider care să lupte pentru popor, nu pentru elite."" Acest mesaj, combinat cu un refuz deschis al discuțiilor progresiste despre tehnologie (precum 5G) sau teoriile sale despre resursele naturale (precum apa contaminată), l-a transformat într-un simbol al luptei împotriva globalizării.

Acum votează toți acei oameni de care ați râs, cei pe care i-ați luat la mișto, cei cărora le-ați lăsat comentarii răutăcioase doar ca să primiți like-uri de la bula voastră frumoasă de stânga. În loc să le explicați cum ar putea să vadă lucrurile altfel, ați preferat să-i marginalizați.

Sunt acei oameni față de care stânga, care ar fi trebuit să fie mai înțelegătoare și să accepte diferențele, nu a făcut decât să le dea cu ușa în față și să-i ponegrească public, în loc să încerce să-i convingă cu răbdare și respect.Rusia stie asta si nu a facut decat sa il promoveze pe asta fix acelor oameni.

Tot ce am zis mai sus combinat cu dezinformarea si faptul ca oamenii care stiu mai bine au preferat sa bea o bere artizanala in timp ce isi numarau like-urile a dus la asta."
"Mesajul meu catre toti cei care au demonstrat, prin comentariile lor legate de participarea comunitatii lgbt la proteste, au demonstrat ca nu au invatat nimic din dezastrul politic de saptamana asta. Un semnal de alarma la adresa mentalitatii care in final o sa va autosaboteze.",Romania,1h1s5vp,2024-11-28 04:19:22,14,0.62,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/1h1s5vp/mesajul_meu_catre_toti_cei_care_au_demonstrat/,Wrathofthebitchqueen,Politică,"Oameni buni, eu dupa postarile din ultimele 3 zile m-am convins de ce a ajuns aceasta tara in halul in care a ajuns. Unii dintre voi dati dovada de o lasitate si o ipocrizie iesita din comun. Daca mai aud o singura data tampenia aia legata de strategia propagandei rusesti ce presupune ""the weaponisation of lgbt"" eu o sa fac spume la gura. 

V-ati gandit vreodata ca ""weaponizarea"" comunitatii queer merge ca pe roate pentru ca NIMENI nu vorbeste deschis in public despre noi? Ca nu suntem subiect de conversatie la masa? Ca 90% dintre voi nu ati declarat niciodata raspicat in public ca sustineti comunitatea lgbt si dreptul nostru la a ne intemeia o familie? Ca suntem subiect taboo in politica? 

De-asta diagrama Venn intre eurosceptici si homofobi este UN CERC. Suntem atat de inexistenti si ostracizati in romania incat votantii AUR si CG sunt convinsi ca noi suntem un produs extern importat din vest. De-asta refuz sa ma cenzurez sa vorbesc despre mine si comunitatea lgbt prin taxiuri, la metrou sau la terase. Iar cei din jur care ma aud poate asa ajung sa nu ma mai considere o noțiune culturala abstracta si straina. Atata timp cat persoanele lgbt se comporta in public ca niste intrusi/infiltratori in propria lor tara, asa vor fi vazute de catre conservatorii homofobi. Cand o intreaga populatie tace din gura si se auto-cenzureaza, atunci dacii astia liberi ajung sa creada ca am fost inventati de americani ca sa anihilam traditiile poporului roman. De-asta ei numesc comunitatea lgbt ca fiind o ""ideologie"". Ca noi nu existam ca oameni in carne si oase pentru ei.

Iar voi toti le faceti jocul de ani de zile prin refuzul de a va asocia cu noi sau a ne sustine cauza prin implicare activa. Ba dimpotriva, acum majoritatea de aici veniti cu sugestii strategice sa nu iesim in evidenta la proteste pentru a prezerva ""optica"" si sa nu ""oferim amunitie inamicilor"". Oameni buni treziti-va-n pula mea la realitate ca fix de-asta am ajuns sa fim arma politica nr 1 in aceasta tara: pentru ca rusinea si refuzul vostru de a fi asociati cu noi este ceea ce creaza cu adevarat optica cea mai daunatoare cauzei pro-europene, pro-nato, pro-democratie, anti-rusia.   

Pe voi va preocupa optica miscarii anti extrema dreapta dar sunteti prea orbi ca sa va cititi propriul mesaj transmis opozitiei: ""comunitatea lgbt este o vulnerabilitate a societatii romanesti ce poate fi exploatata de extrema dreapta pentru a ne destabiliza sistemul democratic si a obtine susținerea poporului prin extremism si radicalizare."" 

Poate daca nu eram tratati ca fiind o slabiciune pentru orice campanie politica de succes, atunci CG/AUR nu ar fi avut atat succes cu retorica anti-lgbt in propriile lor campanii (fara sa sufere absolut nicio consecinta). 

Orice tara in care populatia nu vrea sa se asocieze sau sa sustina public femeile/minoritatile/lgbt, acum nu mai stie cum sa scape de partidele de extrema dreapta care au profitat de apatia poporului in ceea ce priveste cauzele sociale si lupta pentru drepturi civile. Uita-ti-va la tarile care se tin tare pe pozitii si fara nicio exceptie in atitudinile pro-drepturile femeilor si lgbt. Parca extremismului inca nu le-a intors societatea cu fundul in sus. Rusii nu au reusit sa influenteze alegeri cu propaganda lor de doi lei. Kamala in schimb a ignorat in toata campania ei discutiile despre lgbt, woke, si persoane trans, in incercarea de a castiga votul conservatorilor middle class. A pierdut. De ce? Pentru ca desi ea nu a zis nimic de social justice si transgender rights, TRUMP A REFUZAT SA TACA DIN GURA MAI MULT DE DOUA MINUTE LEGATE PE ACEST SUBIECT. El a controlat tot discursul pe aceasta tema. Si a functionat de minune. 

De ce in plm? Pentru ca o societate care sustine vocal si direct aceste lucruri, o societate care merge la proteste, o societate care refuza sa mature ""indezirabilii"" sunt preș si sa ignore subiectul, este o societate care este MULT mai greu de radicalizat. Greu sa radicalizezi un popor impotriva unei minoritati atunci cand minoritatea respectiva are sustinerea celor din jur si puterea sa lupte inapoi prin educatie, cultivarea tolerantei, reprezentanti publici de succes si organizarea activitatilor culturale. 

Voi in pana mea la birou nu voiati sa discutati despre asta si nici la terasa nu dezbateati subiecte de genul cu cei din jur, pentru ca sunt ""prea political/polarizante/woke"" si evitati orice posibil conflict de opinie. in casa cu familia unii dintre voi nu v-ati obosit sa le schimbati mentalitatea pentru ca ""sunt conservatori religiousi si la varsta asta nu se mai pot schimba"". Si apoi va mirati ca homofobia, rasismul si misoginia ajung sa fie exploatate de politicienii de extrema dreapta ca sa intre la putere. 

Acesta este rezultatul actiunilor voastre. Iar eu ca proasta credeam ca in urma celor intamplate duminica, o sa va treziti naibii odata. Pe dracu. Numai postari negative legate de prezenta persoanelor lgbt la protestele din ultimele zile. Va prefaceti ingrijorati si credeti ca daca ne ascundeti de public in dulap atunci ii ramane nepatata imaginea Elenei Lasconi in ochii extremistilor. Fix atitudinea asta a dus la aceasta situatie oameni buni. Vreti sa nu mai fim folositi ca arma politica? Vreti sa nu mai fie exploatata misoginia si xenofobia poporului pentru a servi intereselor rusesti? 

Atunci sustineti tare si raspicat atat comunitatea lgbt cat si feminismul/drepturile si egalitatea femeilor. Pentru ca numai asa se rezolva aceasta vulnerabilitate a sistemului. ca altfel ajungem ca republicanii din america care au exploatat singuratatea si lipsa succesului romantic al barbatilor tineri pentru a ii radicaliza impotriva femeilor si a ii indemna sa militeze impotriva drepturilor lor. Au reusit asta lejer doar prin social media si podcasturi alt-right. Daca mama/bunica voastra nu poate fi convinsa sa voteze cu o femeie presedinte din cauza misoginiei, asta spune mai multe despre voi ca adulti decat despre ele ca mentalitate. Va plangeti de lipsa de educatie din tara dar nu ati depus efort sa va educati propriile mame si restul femeilor din familie.  

Voi chiar credeti ca, daca printr-un miracol scapam cu basma curata si castiga Lasconi, peste cativa ani la alegeri nu o sa se intample aceeasi poveste? Nu vor fi exploatate aceleasi mentalitati? Nu vom fi in continuare folositi ca tapi ispasitori pentru a radicaliza masele? In cativa ani o sa fie mult mai rau ca acum. Poate chiar si prea tarziu pentru a mai schimba ceva. 

In romania 9% dintre adulti se identifica ca fiind LGBT! 9%!!! Voi va dati seama ca daca am fi sa votam toti 9% cu Lasconi, ii garantam victoria in pana mea. Daca voi, astia, cica ""aliatii"" nostri, ne mai incurajati cat de cat sa prindem putere, atunci am putea sa convingem cate 4-5 persoane de fiecare minim. Dar de unde putere si curaj din partea noastra daca voua va este efectiv rusine cu noi si ne devalorificati? De unde putere daca ne bagati sub pres la proteste?

Mai oameni buni, daca fiecare roman, care a vizionat cu placere la viata lui filme pentru adulti din categoria ""lesbians"", participa in ultimii ani la parada Pride, atunci pana acum aveam si drepturi egale, si familii deja intemeiate, si mult mai multe resurse sa contribuim la educarea si de-radicalizarea celor din jur. Nu se mai zicea la noi ca ""poporul roman nu este gata pentru recunoasterea uniunii civile a persoanelor lgbt"". Nu se mai capitula in fata BOR-ului la fiecare moft de-al lor. Nu se mai dadea vina pe noi pentru toate neajunsurile societatii. 

Dar cel mai important, am fi reusit sa fim indeajuns de puternici, integrati si acceptati incat sa nu ajungem sa fim cea mai convenabila arma a politicii de extrema dreapta si pro-ruse. 

Propunerea mea: voi, macar in acest ultim ceas sustineti-ne activ si public ca sa nu mai alimentati idea ca suntem o vulnerabilitate a campaniei Lasconi ce trebuie ascunsa si ignorata (cum a si fost in ultimii 20 de ani), iar la anul la Pride promit ca va facem loc sa veniti cu gratarele, boxele care pot sa bubuie orice de la manele la coruri gregoriene (dupa gust), cu mingile de footbal si toti baietii cu care va jucati fifa online. Din partea mea puteti sa veniti la parada sub pretextul etalarii celor mai smechere cosplay-uri ale voastre ca si asa nu avem Comic-Con in tara. Si la noi in comunitate sunt foarte multi cosplayerii, unii chiar profesionisti. Singura diferenta este ca titulatura lor este de ""Drag Queens""."
Paradoxul tolerantei,Romania,1h19dqv,2024-11-27 12:13:16,13,0.72,6,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance,Corporatistul,Discuție,"Va propun sa discutam si despre altceva decat despre Georgescu dar la fel de relevant pentru contextual politic in care ne aflam. 

Vreau sa discutam despre paradoxul tolerantei.

Karl Popper ne spune ca o societate toleranta ar trebuii sa interzica grupurile ce promoveaza intoleranta altfel, aceste grupuri / acesti indivizi ar exploata toleranta societatii si ar creste nestingheriti. 

John Rawls propune ca o societate dreapta ar trebuii sa ii tolereze pe intoleranti pana cand in acestia devina periculosi pentru liberatile societatii.

In Germania de exemplu este interzis orice forma de nationalism extremis, sunt interzise insemnele nazismului si spalarea criminalilor nazisti.

In Romania, toate grupurile de legionari isi fac veacul bine mersi, partidul ""Noua Dreapta"" a si candidat in 2020 la parlamentare dar a luat sub 1% din voturi. In schimb avem partide sub acoperire care fac din acelasi grup fascist. AUR, SOS si mai nou POT.

In 2022, Liberatatea a publicat un articol de investigatie asupra miscarii legionare din Romania si i-a legat mai pe toti actorii principali: Simion, Georgescu de aceste miscari. [Link catre articol](https://www.libertatea.ro/opinii/de-cine-este-sprijinit-aur-ruta-de-la-preotii-din-biserica-ortodoxa-catre-neolegionarism-camaraderia-dintre-simion-si-noua-dreapta-3953723)

Credeti ca ar trebuii ca aceste miscari extremiste sa fie interzise si scoase in afara legii si la noi in tara la fel ca in Germania? Credeti ca personaje precum Sosoaca care intr-un live de curand i-a facut eroi si martiri pe Corneliu Codrea Zeleanu si pe Ion Antonescu ar trebuii sa mai aiba viata politica la noi in tara? 

Credeti ca am fi intoleranti daca i-am scoate in afara legii pe acesti actori?

Opinia mea este ca nu, nu am fi intoleranti. Liberatile omului nu trebuiesc ingradite de nimeni. Fiecare om este liber sa faca ce vrea, sa creada ce vrea, sa iubeasca pe cine vrea atata timp cat actiunea lui nu constrange liberatile altei persoane. 

Noi suntem una dintre putinele tari care in ultimii 80-90 de ani am trecut prin ambele extreme, de la fascismul de dreapta din 38 pana in 47 iar apoi la comunism pana in 89. Iar noi nu am invatat nimic din aceste experiente. Eu pun acest esec major pe seama lipsei educatiei a populatiei. Nu am idee ce se mai preda in scoli la ora actuala, dar la inceputul anilor 2000 cand am facut eu scoala, la ora de Istorie s-a trecut ca prin branza peste perioada fascista si cea comunista, nu s-a mai deloc despre aceste evenimente... la fel cum nu s-a discutat deloc despre Revolutia de la 89. Ma indoiesc ca s-ar fi schimbat ceva in acest sens.

Paradoxul tolerantei nu este un topic usor de digerat si sunt curios sa aflu si parerile voastre indiferent de ce parte a baricadei va aflati.

In final va las cu doua citate:

""Cei ce nu isi aduc aminte trecutul sunt condamnati sa il repete"" - George Santayana (The Life of Reason, 1905)
""Voi lupta pana la ultima mea picatura de sange ca sa ai dreptul sa nu fii de accord cu mine!"" - Ion Ratiu (Confruntare televizatin Mai 1990, Ion Iliescu vs Ion Ratiu vs Radu Campeanu)"

Voi cum ati trecut peste o despartire in care partenera/ul face parte din acelasi grup de prieteni?,CasualRO,1h0m6vd,2024-11-26 15:40:27,28,0.76,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualRO/comments/1h0m6vd/voi_cum_ati_trecut_peste_o_despartire_in_care/,SpicedMorganEnjoyer,:relatie: Dragoste și Relații,"Edit: Primul post pe reddit, mi-am facut in sfarsit cont pt ca n-am gasit nicaieri un post similar, niciun video YT, Quora, whatever.

Multumesc oricui citeste asta, mai mult am scris-o sa ma descarc, dar chiar cred ca m-ar ajuta sa aud si opiniile altora care au trecut prin asta.



Dupa 3 ani jumate, m-am despartit de iubita din motive de infidelitate. Suntem prieteni buni de peste 10 ani si toti prietenii mei din oras sunt si ai ei.

Am crezut ca trec incet incet peste, mai ales cand am inceput sa ma revad cu ea si am vazut ca pot sa fiu ok cat de cat. Dar simt ca imi revine iar starea negativa, ceva efectiv insuportabil si nu-mi sta capul decat la cum mi-a gresit si cum pot s-o fac sa sufere la fel ca mine. 

Dupa despartire, imi tot spune ca ii pare rau, ca eu n-am gresit cu nimic si isi asuma vina, dar nu ma incalzeste cu absolut nimic. Vrea sa fie iar cu mine, dar dupa o perioada de distractie...mars. Stie cat m-a ranit cu replica asta, sper ca si-a invatat lectia... Isi tot cere scuze si vrea sa ma vada ok, dar o parte din mine nu vrea sa-i dea satisfactia sa ma vada ok... Asta face sa simt cumva ca toata negativitatea mea e performativa, inautentica, mi-o doresc pt ca in nu stiu care situatie ipotetica e s-ar simti si mai prost. Mi se pare patetic, dar nu ma pot opri nici din a ma simti prost, dar nici din a ma simti fals.

Nu am cu cine vorbi despre cum ma simt, nu vreau sa-i stric imaginea fata de niciunul din membrii grupului, nu o judec ca prietena, am stiut in ce ma bag, am facut greseala clasica de a ma atasa de cineva toxic crezand c-o pot ""salva"". Si eu sunt toxic la randul meu, si nu, n-as lasa pe cineva sa ma salveze voit, evident. Chestiile astea tot timpul dau gres....

Dar da, idea e ca nu stiu cum sa trec mai repede peste in timp ce o sa ma vad in continuare cu ea si nici n-am cui sa ma descarc. Nu sunt o fire sociabila, oamenii ma obosesc, oamenii noi si mai mult. Nu caut prieteni noi, ii vreau pe aceasi, dar ea, fiind mult mai sociabila ca mine, simt ca-i acapareaza pe toti si n-am prilej sa ma vad doar eu cu ei. Nu caut deloc sa-i intorc impotriva ei sau ceva de genul, ar fi si imposibil, cu totii ne stim defectele, si n-ar fi prima oara cand s-a intamplat ceva similar in grup. Ne acceptam cu bune si cu rele, de asta nu e o optiune, sa fug de toti, e prietenie adevarata.


Iesim la o ocazie sau alta, o vad acolo, e totul ok si-mi zic ca e aceasi tipa pe care o stiam si inainte, n-a fost sa fie intre noi, are drumul ei de parcurs, eu il am pe al meu, dar e al naibii de frustrant cand ajung inapoi acasa si imediat ma complac in ura, furie, autocompatimire...

N-am mai simtit ceva de genul din liceu, si-au trecut vreo 15 ani de-atunci, asa ca mi-e cumva straina toata experienta asta. 


tl;dr M-am despartit de partenera pt ca m-a inselat. Grupul de prieteni e comun. Am fost prieteni mult timp inainte sa fiu cu ea, vreau in continuare sa fim prieteni. Singurele ocazii sociale unde pot iesi sunt cele unde e si ea prezenta. Nu vreau s-o fac de rahat prietenilor, deci nu pot sa ma refulez cu adevarat. Cum fac sa trec mai repede peste? 






Also, stiu, plety of fish in the sea, dar nu ma pot gandi la asta inca. Nu-s genul sa ma bag in chestii superficiale, n-am de ales in privinta asta."
Mining for Success: The Promising Futures of Element79 and Galloper Gold,CanadianStockExchange,1h0hwqf,2024-11-26 12:49:14,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianStockExchange/comments/1h0hwqf/mining_for_success_the_promising_futures_of/,MightBeneficial3302,Analysis,"For those who have been living under a rock. To a short-term gain of USD and up to USD in a few years. It's not a sure thing, but it looks more than possible. A bunch of folks shouted silver and quickly regretted it as investors unleashed large buy orders and crushed the shorts.

https://preview.redd.it/zrd7v6oz5a3e1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe77badc119096e0aa8afaaf9b9ca2f4e0564218

That's strength. Physical or certs are acceptable for long-term buying from one of the big solid companies. The problem is liquidity. Stocks as gold proxies can be bought and sold practically the order entered.

**Number One**

**Element79 Gold Corp.** (CSE: ELEM) (FSE: 7YS0) (OTC: ELMGF) (""Element79"" or the ""Company"") is a mining company focused on exploring and developing its past-producing, high-grade gold and silver mine, the Lucero Project. This project is strategically located in Arequipa, Peru, a region known for its rich mineral deposits, with the intent to restart production in the near term.

https://preview.redd.it/43muj3at9a3e1.jpg?width=1901&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b2cefa38d69021cc2e206df2c2a1b40e9a381fc

**Who We Are**

Element79 Gold is a near-term cash-flow mining company focused on gold, silver, and associated metals. It is committed to maximizing shareholder value through responsible mining practices and sustainable project development.

Our flagship project, Lucero, is a previously produced high-grade gold mine. It is permitted for 350 tpd of ore extraction and has the immediate-term potential to generate revenue, and we are currently working to bring it back into production in 2024 and beyond. The Lucero Project holds significant promise, and we are optimistic about its potential to yield substantial returns.

**Key Assets**

Element79 Gold's flagship property is a cash-flow generator. The Lucero Mine is permitted for 350 tpd, and we are working to bring this high-grade gold mine back into production in 2024.

The company also owns notable exploration assets along the Battle Mountain trend in Nevada, Clover, which will be explored and drilled with the intent to generate resource value (Website). Another Corporate asset is the amount of relevant verbiage released to keep investors in the know.

[Corporate Presentation](https://www.element79.gold/_files/ugd/0feb69_690e123bc0844d94ae6c88c1f072e30b.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/g45rj42x9a3e1.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84dc18a64fb3cfc7a843e6ae9c1d61290b03f30

Investors are entreated to trust that the very experienced management can bring Lucero back into play. Why? Even though the shares have weakened, an excellent volume of trading has appeared, indicating a strong interest in the company's stock.

Four hundred fifty-five underground channel samples have been collected from this latest phase, representing nearly 600 kg (620kg) of mineralization and 650 kg of wall rock, which underwent comprehensive analysis by our partners at Ore Discovery and unveiled significant exploration potential. Notably, results in 115 samples returned substantial values in gold (Au) (ranging from 1.0 g/t to 98.1 g/t), silver (Ag) (ranging from 0.7 g/t to 3,026 g/t), lead (Pb) (as high as 2.0%) and zinc (Zn) (up to 3.5%), highlighting the robust potential of Lucero's mineral endowment.

A place in your long-term, junior gold sector of your portfolio. I own some. I am looking for the APR telling me Lucero is in serious production. And the gold price has exceeded USD.

**Number Two**

**Galloper Gold Corp.** **(CSE: BOOM; OTC: GGDCF; Frankfurt: W9F) (the “Company” or “Galloper**”) is an intriguing stock with some exciting properties, including Glover Island in Western Newfoundland.

https://preview.redd.it/qj5rdas1aa3e1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6864168ca1721fac93daa7533a8cd9c0567de04

*Galloper’s land, covering 133 sq. km, is considered highly prospective for structurally controlled orogenic gold deposits, as well as copper-gold-rich VMS deposits. Galloper is the dominant landowner on Glover Island, essentially creating 'our island on an island' with exceptional discovery potential. This unique position sets us apart and adds an element of intrigue to our investment proposition.*

**Salient Points**

·  **Galloper Gold is focused on advancing its flagship Glover Island asset in western Newfoundland.**

·  **Glover Island is at the convergence of major fault zones, where a known historic gold resource defined by dozens of drill holes more than a decade ago exists.**

·  **Galloper's 133 sq km land package surrounds this historic zone, continuing along a northeast trend for 36 km, and it is a potential new large-scale gold discovery.**

**Driven by a management and technical team with successful exploration and production backgrounds, and supported by capital markets expertise, Galloper's ""outside the box"" thinking helps make the company a unique player in an increasingly selective junior resource sector.**

[**Corporate Presentation**](https://gallopergold.com/GalloperGold_October21_2024.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/1n27i2p4aa3e1.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=17cfa678f835b7cacb51ceda1353932d471a422b

The chart shows weakening and softening recently, as does ELEM above, but it likely represents a good junior gold proxy in a long-term junior portfolio. There have been some nice trading spikes over the last few weeks, indicating periods of increased trading activity and potential profit opportunities for investors.

Mr. Hratch Jabrayan, Galloper CEO, commented: *“Glover Island represents compelling new discovery opportunities well beyond the known historic deposit defined more than a dozen years ago, so we’re excited to begin the drilling phase of our work there. Most of Glover Island has never been systematically explored as evidenced by the copper anomaly we’ve uncovered on the western side of the Island. The convergence of major faults at Glover Island and the widespread presence of ‘the right rocks’ is an excellent recipe for a potential large-scale system consistent with what has been observed elsewhere in this ‘Four Corners’ region of Western Newfoundland.”*

Galloper's other property is Mint Pond.

Galloper's other property, Mint Pond, holds the potential to emerge as a significant new grassroots gold and/or base metals discovery following Galloper's 2022-2023 work programs. The property, never previously explored, has shown promising signs with **initial soil sampling revealing anomalous gold and copper value**s in clusters, a result that was highly encouraging when combined with data from Galloper's LiDAR Survey and regional magnetic surveys

Galloper boasts an **impressive team** with decades of business and broad mining experience. The newly installed CEO, Hratch Jabrayan, brings over two decades of high-level resource sector experience to Galloper, including seven years with Dundee Precious Metals, where he significantly advanced the company's interests in Armenia and globally. This wealth of experience should instil confidence in the team's ability to lead Galloper to success.

The team at Boom is a group of seasoned mining professionals with a proven track record. Their experience and capabilities make them well-suited to bring BOOM into production. Galloper, under their leadership, is focused on mineral exploration in the Central Newfoundland Gold Belt with its Glover Island and Mint Pond properties, each prospective for gold and base metals. The Glover Island Property consists of 532 mining claims totaling 13,300 hectares while Mint Pond consists of 499 claims totaling 12,475 hectares.

Again, it seems to be a good prospect and proxy for the ring gold market shortly.As with ELEM, I eagerly anticipate the future PR as both companies ramp up production. The upcoming announcements are sure to bring exciting news and further boost investor interest."
 Vreau să îmi îndepărtez soțul de mătușa lui ,WomenRO,1h0d1nv,2024-11-26 09:24:27,11,0.92,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenRO/comments/1h0d1nv/vreau_să_îmi_îndepărtez_soțul_de_mătușa_lui/,clauuubauu,Rant - No advice,"
Deși soțul meu nu vorbește cu ea, am observat de mai mult timp ca se interesează de ea prin diferite moduri. 
Am încercat să ignor chestia asta de la început, numai că recent mătușa lui mi-a spus niște vorbe groaznice și pur și simplu nu o mai suport. 

Ea are un iubit din Maroc cu care soțul meu se înțelege ok deși cu ea nu comunica așa că recent am inceput sa ieșim aproape în fiecare weekend cu ei doi. Din aceste ieșiri pe care le-am avut, tipul ăsta crede că ma cunoaște și ca își permite glume cu mine , mi-a spus că sunt o țărancă care nu a mai ieșit niciodată afară în oraș și ca fără soțul meu eram un nimic. M-am simțit  ciudat atunci când a început să mi pună întrebări despre părinții mei și să se intereseze de viața  mea de dinainte. I-am spus soțului meu ca ma deranjează și ca ar trebui să-i spună să înceteze, dar el radea, la fel și mătușa lui și mi-a spus că nu are ce s-a îi spună. 
Aceste glume au continuat și eu ma saturasem. 

I-am spus soțului meu ca nu vreau sa mai ies cu ei , plus de faptul că mătușa lui ma îmi dă un feeling de parcă  m-ar spiona, să vadă ce cumpăr, dacă cheltuiesc aiurea banii (soțului) ca apoi să îmi informeze soacra. 

Așa că am decis ca nu vreau sa mai stau în preajma lor. 
Eu si soțul meu ne-am certat din cauza astam iar eu mi-am spus ""OF-ul"" părințiilor mei deoarece soțul meu nu voia să ma asculte. Le-am spus despre glumele care au fost și ca soțul meu se ceartă cu mine din cauza ca nu vreau sa mai ies cu mătușa lui, CU CARE NU VORBEȘTE DE APROAPE 4 ANIIII. 
Așa a aflat și soacra mea, care normal ca i-a spus surorii sale, cu pretextul că voia să știe ce se întâmplase defapt. 

Mătușa asta a soțului meu a venit la noi în cameră la 23 jumate și a cerut ca vrea să vorbească cu soțul meu. Acesta a refuzat, așa că a vorbit cu mine. Eu i-am cerut să vorbim afară din cameră, pentru ca era târziu și soțul meu trebuia să meargă la muncă la 6 dimineata. Ea a spus că vrea să discute în camera mea pentru ca voia să cadă bine în fața soțului meu. 

Mi-a spus că iubitul ei nu a greșit cu nimic, ca au fost doar niște glume și ca  parintii mei o cred pe ea ceva gen  curwa care bagă pe toată lumea în casă. Mi-a vorbit cu o autoritate de cacat când ea nici nu avea dreptul să ma tragă la răspundere. Mi-a spus ca trebuie să îmi elimin părinții din viața mea deoarece acum sunt măritată și trebuie să îmi ascult soțul ( țin să mentionez ca a avut o casnice rroma eșuată din cauza ei,nu am nevoie de sfaturile ei) Am refuzat să îi răspund la atacuri pentru ca stiam ca după eu si soacra mea ne vom certa mai tare din cauza ei așa ca am lăsat-o să vorbească. În final mi-a spus cu o ignoranța atat de mare: EU NU CRED CA (numele soțului) ÎȘI DOREȘTE O FEMEIE CUM EȘTI TU. 

O URASC. 

Nu am mai vorbit cu ea de atunci și nici nu am de gând să  o fac. Nici nu ma intereseaza faptul că o să am discuții din cauza ei cu soacra mea, dar o urăsc foarte tare. Soțul meu nu a zis nimic despre tot ce s-a întâmplat. Ma doare foarte tare. I

Soțul meu lucrează la o fabrică de pantofi Gucci și are avantajul de a cumpăra pantofii  si adidași Gucci mult mai ieftini. 

Aseară soacra mea i-a spus soțului meu ca cat o să mai aibă aceasta ocazie s ai cumpere și mătușii sale niște adidași. A vorbit de parcă ar fi fost un ordin. Acesta nu a zis nimic.
Când ne-am băgat în pat i-am spus că cat eu o să stau în dreapta lui el nu o să mai vorbească niciodată cu mătușa lui și ca nu am de gând să-l las să îi cumpere absolut nimic.

1st . The original message I want to tell in my own words in English.

This message is to show you the difference between AI Generated and AI curated.. And I will help to make a example for LeadGen and Selling pourposes.

This is how the message will go out if I write it directly in English (not my first language).

""The use of AI is among us and we will qualify as stupid if we dont use it to be better at whatever we do. In sales however sending the right message is really important, be clear with the ideas and have an structured message will help a lot on generating that response or engagement we are looking for. Recently I was warned that messages to be suspected be generated by AI will end up on the removal from the grup. And this make me think a lot about it, because yes I use AI to translate correctly my messages and to give them a better structure so I can communicate my ideas more effectively, I call this ""curation"" of my messages, but the idea, the knowledge and the experience behind that messages are all mine. So i dont believe this is wrong, on the contrary is better for me and the users that read my posts that I can communicate more effective.

Thoughts ?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
2nd . Now the message I wrote in Spanish with my ideas to be strucured and translated by AI.

El uso de AI en nuestras vidas es algo que debemos de aprovechar, llego para quedarse y para ayudarnos a ser más efectivos en nuestras labores diarias, me atrevo a decir que seria estupido no utilizarlas, recientemente recibí un mensaje que estipula que si los mensajes son sopechosos de ser AI generated, puedes ser retirado de la comunidad. Ahora esto me puso a pensar mucho sobre el uso de AI y si si lo utilizó para traducir y dar estructura a mis ideas y mensajes, lo msimo aplica en ventas y en Lead Gen, es super importante ser efectivo y acertivo en la comunicación, entonces por que no usar estas grandes herramientas para tener una comunicación mas efectiva ?, es esto malo?, es hacer trampa?. Desde mi punto de vista es necesario usar las herramnientas de manera adecuada, si uso AI para ""curar"" mis mensajes no es por que pida a AI que los genere por mí, es para que me ayude a comunicar de mejor manera mis ideas y de eso se trata las ventas, de ser acertivos comunicando. Creo firmemente que tanto para mí como para los usuarios que me leen que es mucho mejor si logro enviar de manera correcta mi mensaje. Que opinan?

The use of AI in our daily lives should be fully embraced—it’s designed to enhance effectiveness and productivity. Ignoring it is a missed opportunity. Recently, I received a notification about posts suspected of being AI-generated, which made me reflect on this.

Yes, I use AI to translate and structure my ideas, but the core—the content, experience, and knowledge—is entirely mine. AI is simply a tool to amplify clarity and impact, which is crucial in sales for delivering concise, well-structured messages.

It’s about working smarter while preserving authenticity. What’s your take?---------

Message 1 and 3 - same idea, synthesized with more effective structure and communication."
My Skyrim with mods stops when I'm outside,skyrimmods,1gxperm,2024-11-22 21:36:58,0,0.33,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1gxperm/my_skyrim_with_mods_stops_when_im_outside/,JLCV_8,PC SSE - Help,"Hi friends, I have Skyrim 1.1170 with mods. I have a glitch that I can't fix. It's that when I'm outside in the overworld, after a while for a few minutes the game stops and I have to restart the entire PC because afterwards there's no way to remove it or resume it. Please help. Can I upload my list of mods to see if you know of any that are incompatible?

Why are there 4 Orc characters who are listed as Complete Monsters on TV Tropes but no Human characters?,warcraftlore,1gwuqy1,2024-11-21 19:21:05,0,0.36,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/1gwuqy1/why_are_there_4_orc_characters_who_are_listed_as/,Hot_Reach_7138,,"So, for those of you who don\`t know there is a trope created by TV Tropes called Complete Monsters (also known as Pure Evil). They are regarded as the very worst of the worst characters from a certain franchise. There are a lot of requirements for these trope but the main ones are the following:

The character has ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING QUALITIES. Even if a character has some redeeming qualities at the start of the story he/she could still become a Complete Monster if he/she loses them. Even one single redeeming quality is enough to disqualify a character from this trope.

The character in question commits horrible, atrocious crimes that are presented seriously within the story and their actions are worse than the actions of most other villains in the story. We also take into account their resources and their ability to cause harm to other people. This means that if a character has more resources (if for example he/she is a ruler that commands thousands of people), then he/she needs to comit bigger atrocities in order to stand out. If a character has less resources to harm people (for example, if he/she is a lone serial killer), then he/she qualifies if their crimes are heinous enough considering their resources. If a character\`s actions are not heinous enough by the standards of the story then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster. The character\`s crimes must pass several different heinous standards in order for the character to count as a Complete Monster:

\- The baseline standard - This is a common standard that all villains need to pass, no matter the work they come from. This means that the villain needs to commit crimes that are worse than animal cruelty, theft, abuse (unless the abuse is REALLY extreme but that rarely happens) and trying to kill the main characters (because this is something most villains try to do).

\- The standards of the work - This means that the villain should be compared to other villains from the same work (or franchise) to see if his/her actions are bad enough to make him/her stand out. This means that a villain who comes from a lighthearted series like My Little Pony needs to be compared to other villains from My Little Pony and not to villains from grimdark franchises such as Warhammer 40000, A Song of Ice and Fire and Berserk. Similarly, a villain who comes from a work with high heinous standard should be compared to other villains from the same franchise and not to villains that come from My Little Pony.

\- The resource standard - This means that we should also take into consideration the villain\`s resources and their ability to hurt other people as I already mentioned.

\- The system standard - This means that if a villain is part of an organization or a group, then the villain needs to be the worst member or one of the worst (if the organisation is big like the Galactic Empire for example)

3) The character\`s motivation for commiting those crimes or the character him/herself are never portrayed sympathetically and he/she has either no excuse for his/her actions or their excuse is not portrayed sympathetically. Even if the character in question has some traumatic moment that has shaped his/her personality, it doesn\`t excuse their actions and the narrative doesn\`t try to make you feel sorry for them.

4) The character has enough understanding of human morality to tell right from wrong and make decisions. This means that characters who are severely mentally ill, possessed or brainwashed or from a race or culture that can\`t comprehend morality or has an entirely different morality can\`t qualify. However, characters who are mentally ill can still qualify if they can tell right from wrong despite their mental illness (for example, the Joker).

5) The character is portrayed seriously and is not a Comic Relief (a character you are supposed to laugh at and not take very seriously). Even if the character is funny he/she can still be a Complete Monster if they are portrayed seriously despite their sense of humor. If the character is treated as a joke by the narrative itself (which often happens in kid\`s shows), then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster.

6) The character must make AT LEAST ONE APPEARANCE in the story itself. Characters that are just mentioned by other characters and make no appearance can\`t qualify. Aside from that, if all the crimes commited by the character happen off-screen/off-page and are only vaguely described, then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster. That being said, flashback characters can qualify under certain circumstances if they have enough personality and crimes that have effect on-screen are still considered.

7) The audience is not supposed to feel bad for a Complete Monsterr when something bad happens to him/her because their comeuppance is completely deserved and the narrative doesn\`t try to make the audience feel sympathy for the Complete Monster.

8) The character must come from a work which has at least some semblence of plot and is not pure exploitation and is more complex than ""bad guy does evil things for no apparent reason"" type of plot. A horror film or book can still contain a Complete Monster but it needs to have some plot. For this reasons films like Human Centipede and Serbian Film don\`t contain Complete Monsters because they are viewed by TvTropes as plotless exploitation even though the villains are extremely repulsive.

9) A character must meet ALL of the above mentioned criteria in order to be a Complete Monster.

Below, I will copy and paste all the entries of the characters who were approved as Complete Monsters by TV Tropes:

[**Gul'dan**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer)

* Gul'dan, the first [Big Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad), is a power-hungry [orc](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent) who voluntarily corrupted his people into a [bloodthirsty horde](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WarcraftTheHordeOldHorde) which he secretly controls, planned the Draenei Genocide and brought the orcs into Azeroth so they could trigger two wars. He also created Garona as a ""breeding experiment"" between an orc soldier and a female Draenei prisoner, after which she was magically aged, tortured and mind controlled into becoming his personal assassin. Finally, he betrayed the Horde to follow his own goals, which caused the defeat of the orcs. Even after his death his evil lingered around his skull, corrupting everything around it.
* Gul'dan from the alternate universe Draenor matches his main timeline counterpart for wickedness. While he initially fails to get his fellow orcs to drink the demon blood, Gul'dan quickly makes up for failure by serving as the Burning Legion's vanguard. He sends Cho'gall to Oshu'gun to subjugate the Naaru there, sends Teron'gor to Auchindoun to empower the Shadow Council by [devouring the souls](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulEating) of dead Draenei, and tries himself to cause a volcano to erupt in Shadowmoon Valley. As the Iron Horde falls apart, he takes advantage by [finally corrupting his people](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter) like his prime counterpart. Victorious at last, Gul'dan tries to deliver the deathblow to Draenor by destroying its elements with the Cipher of Damnation and siphons the world's ley lines—like power lines, only with magical energy instead of electricity—to power a new portal to allow the Legion to arrive in all its might. After the Legion's invasion of Draenor fails, Gul'dan is forcibly sent to Azeroth, whereupon he opens a portal in the tomb of Sargeras and causes a massive invasion by the Legion which claims the lives of many innocent people, some of whom die directly at Gul'dan's hands. Finally, after blackmailing the Nightborne into joining the Legion, Gul'dan tries to summon Sargeras into the world using the combined powers of the Nightwell and Illidan Stormrage's body before finally dying at the hands of a revived Illidan. Regardless of the circumstances provided by a new timeline, Gul'dan proves that he will always be a heartless monster willing to sacrifice everything to gain power.
* In the [2016 live-action film](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarCraft2016), [Gul'dan](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks) is a ruthless orc [warlock](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer) who [reigns over the Horde](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad) with an iron fist. Addicted to dark fel magic, Gul'dan seeks to expand the Horde into the world of Azeroth to conquer. Opening a portal by [draining the lives of hundreds of innocent Draenei prisoners](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild), he sends the Horde out to conquer and destroy all in its path. Eventually it is revealed that Draenor was rendered a dying world by Gul'dan's own abuse of the fel, and Gul'dan has zero compunction about doing the same to Azeroth. Rounding up human captives to empower his magic, Gul'dan tortures one by [slowly draining his life](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain), plotting to use the rest to open up the portal for the rest of the Horde. When the honorable chieftain Durotan tries to stand against Gul'dan, Gul'dan orders his clan slaughtered, including [Durotan's baby son](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild). When Durotan challenges Gul'dan to a duel, Gul'dan cheats to win by using his magic to drain Durotan's life after he finds himself without the advantage and promptly murders several orcs when they turn from him in disgust. Even at the end, Gul'dan demonstrates he has no loyalty to his people or their traditions when he orders the heroic Anduin Lothar killed after Lothar defeats Gul'dan right-hand orc Blackhand in fair combat. Greedy, power-hungry, and insatiable in his desires, Gul'dan will happily condemn any world to destruction as long as he can fuel his addiction to the fel.

[**The Old Gods and their Minions**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WarcraftTheOldGods)

Old Gods 

* [N'Zoth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptor), lord of Ny'alotha, is the weakest of the four Old Gods who arrived on Azeroth in ages past. The [craftiest](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) and most wicked of his kin, N'Zoth ruled part of the Black Empire with numerous atrocities until the arrival of the Titans. [Sealed away](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan) at the bottom of the seas, N'Zoth found a way to whisper in the mind of the Dragon Aspect Neltharion. Steadily swaying Neltharion to become the evil Deathwing and helping to facilitate the genocide of the Blue Dragonflight, N'Zoth also transformed queen Azshara and her followers into the Naga with intent to overwhelm the surface one day. In modern day, N'Zoth twists the Emerald Dream with the Emerald Nightmare to corrupt and destroy the dreaming through his agent Xavius. Empowering Deathwing to cause the Cataclysm and wipe out the face of Azeroth, N'Zoth secretly plans to dispose of the dragon when he is free. Finally unleashing the Naga after arranging a new war between Horde and Alliance, N'Zoth intends to restore the Black Empire to glory in endless atrocity and return creation to the Void.
* [Yogg-Saron](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination) is the Old God of [Death](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfTheDead), and he proves himself to be every bit as vile as his rival N'Zoth. Forming the Black Empire with the other Old Gods, Yogg-Saron would last longer than his rivals and had his C'thraxxi minions slaughter many Titanforged before he was finally [locked away](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan) in the prison city of Ulduar. While imprisoned, [Yogg-Saron](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard) would take advantage of Keeper Loken having an affair with Keeper Thorim's wife Sif; Yogg-Saron tricked Loken into killing Sif, and got him to start a war between Thorim and his Frost Giant allies while Yogg-Saron corrupted the Forge of Wills with the Curse of Flesh to make Titanforged easier to corrupt while also tainting the world tree Vordrassil and creating the [Emerald Nightmare](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape), all the while enslaving his jailers and getting Loken to manipulate himself into the position of Prime Designate, assuring that the death of Yogg-Saron's foremost pawn would usher in [the death of all life on Azeroth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac).

Minions 

* [Azshara](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen), the [Light of Lights](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood), is the former ancient queen of the Night Elves who, in her endless goal to obtain power and perfection, nearly led all of Azeroth to total ruin. 10,000 years ago, Azshara used her magic to enthrall her people to love her without question while also seeking to purify the world of any she deemed imperfect, who included all but herself and her Highborne servants. While attempting to enact this purification with the power of the Well of Eternity, she caught the attention of [Sargeras](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain), creator of the omnicidal Burning Legion. When he offered to aid in her goal in exchange for her opening a portal for his armies to rampage over Azeroth, Azshara agreed without question. Her actions to satisfy her own limitless vanity led to the War of the Ancients, the deaths of countless innocents, and the breaking of the entire world. Azshara then makes a deal with [N'Zoth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination), who turns her and her servants into the first [naga](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople). As their Empress, Azshara oversees the enslavement and slaughter of countless beings over the course of thousands of years.
* [Cho'gall](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac), the mad prophet of the [Twilight's Hammer cult](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil), [serves the Old Gods](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter) to bring the Void's apocalyptic designs to fruition. Born in the ogre capitol of Highmaul, Cho'gall's ambition led to his exile where he learned fel magic from Gul'dan and void magic from the pale orcs. Learning of the Hour of Twilight, Cho'gall made fulfilling this apocalyptic prophecy his life's work, and formed the Twilight's Hammer clan to make it a reality. He would go on to raze Highmaul and slaughter its people and aid the Horde in their genocidal conquest in the First and Second Wars. Many years later, he attempted to resurrect the Old God C'thun by sacrificing the young half-orc Med'an, and [enslaved](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil) his mother Garona and used her to reignite full scale war between the Horde and Alliance. His final attempts at fulfilling the Hour of Twilight involved healing a wounded Deathwing and using the fallen Aspect to ignite the Cataclysm, and ultimately [put Azeroth within a inch of annihilation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory).
* [Deathwing the Destroyer](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraconicAbomination) was [once the noble Neltharion](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero) until he swore allegiance to the Old Gods and developed a genocidal hatred towards all life. One of Azeroth's most ancient villains, Deathwing would taint his own descendants in his Black [Dragonflight](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WarcraftTheDragonflights) and felt no pity or remorse as he began to replace his dying kin with his own twisted Twilight Dragonflight. In ancient days, Deathwing masterminded the near-extinction of the other Dragonflights and all but annihilated the Blues when he tricked their Aspects into sealing their power into the Dragon Soul before turning that power against them. Using his monstrous molten body, Deathwing painfully raped all but one of his consorts to death, and later had his enemy Alexstrasza raped to produce children [he would corrupt and enslave](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents). In modern times, Deathwing plotted to usher in his dark masters by igniting the Cataclysm to cause untold devastation to the world's mortal civilizations until he was ultimately defeated by his fellow Dragon Aspects. In a [last suicidal charge](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe), Deathwing traveled to the Maelstrom to usher in a final apocalypse to bring all of Azeroth with him into oblivion.
* [Xavius](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceror), once [the high councilor](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon) to Queen Azshara, is best known for the evils he committed as the first satyr and the Nightmare Lord. Xavius can be considered the mastermind behind the Burning Legion's first invasion, when he convinced Azshara and the Highborne that Sargeras was a deity and would lead them to godhood. After his first death, he became the first satyr and [corrupted many of his brethren](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter) into that form while also seeking eternal vengeance on Malfurion Stormrage, who was responsible for his first and second defeats. Changing his allegiance to the Old Gods, Xavius would go on to become the creator and master of the Emerald Nightmare. As the Nightmare Lord, he corrupted much of the Green Dragonflight and entrapped many druids, including Malfurion. Now his prisoner and plaything, Xavius upheld his end of the bargain and began destroying Azeroth. He swallowed much of the world into the Emerald Nightmare causing countless people to become [eternal victims of their own worst nightmares](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream). Eventually defeated again by Malfurion, Xavius would later pledge the Nightmare to the Burning Legion to deliver his wrath to both Malfurion and all of Azeroth.

**Franchise-Wide**

* [Archimonde the Defiler](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction) is the supreme commander of [the Burning Legion](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WarcraftTheBurningLegion) and [the right hand](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon) of the Dark Titan Sargeras. Archimonde began his rise to power by betraying his master and [torturously imprisoning](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream) his soul in his skull for millennia, and later rose to become one of the masters of the Eredar alongside Kil'jaeden and Velen. Behind his comrade's backs, he sold out his people and forged a pact with Sargeras to turn them into the Man'ari, the overlords of the Legion. As their commander, Archimonde masterminded the destruction of countless worlds and the genocide of billions before setting his sights on the world of Azeroth. His first invasion during the War of the Ancients led to the deaths of most of the wild gods and the near-extinction of the night elven race, and his second attempt sparked the Third War and the destruction of Dalaran and the remaining human kingdoms in Lordaeron. He ultimately sought to devour the power of [World Tree](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree) of Azeroth to overthrow Sargeras and become the Legion's new master. Never shown to have his master's [intentions](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist) or Kil'jaeden's regrets, Archimonde was the greatest monster in all the Legion.
* [Blackhand](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser), former chieftain of the Blackrock Clan and the first Warchief of the Horde, is an [ambitious](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil) brute well known for his tactical brilliance and conquest of numerous enemies. Allying with Gul'dan, the warlock stroking Blackhand's ego and hunger for power, the Warchief magically ages [his children](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents) to make them weapons for his new horde and stamps out all dissent with violence. Leading the [genocide](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution) of the Draeni people of Draenor, Blackhand happily allows Gul'dan's twisted rape and breeding experiments with captive Draeni women. Upon discovering Azeroth, Blackhand initiates a mass slaughter of human villages with intent to butcher and enslave every human on Azeroth. Caring nothing for his own race and family, Blackhand has the orcs drink the blood of Mannoroth to make them the servants of demons and even orders his own daughter Griselda [murdered](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring) when she flees the Horde.
* [Dar'Khan Drathir](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil) was once an ordinary High Elf in Quel'Thalas who became obsessed with the Sunwell. After becoming a Magister, Dar'Khan would be approached by the fallen prince Arthas Menethil and was offered the chance to get his hands on the power of the Sunwell if Dar'Khan aided [the Scourge](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WarcraftTheScourge) in invading Quel'Thalas, and slaughtering his fellow elves. [Accepting Arthas' deal](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs), Dar'Khan quickly came to relish [massacring his own people](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideFromTheInside), and would even [betray the Scourge](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder) in trying to claim the Sunwell. After being brought back as a Darkfallen, Dar'Khan would stalk the Human woman Anveena Teague after learning of her connection with the Sunwell, and immediately attempted to kidnap her after learning that she was the Sunwell itself. After being defeated a third time, Dar'Khan would continue assisting the Scourge in Quel'Thalas, and would be slain two more times before he was stopped.
* [Fyrakk the Blazing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsBurningHot) is the most [mentally unstable and destructive](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy) of [the Primal Incarnates threatening the Dragonflights](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WarcraftTheDragonflights). Utterly devoted to the power of the elements, Fyrakk led the armies of the Primalists in the ancient and cataclysmic war against the Order-aligned dragons and was among the first to be imprisoned. Awakened in modern Azeroth, Fyrakk wastes little time in finding and consuming the [corruptive shadowflame](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption) to empower himself and wage a renewed war against the mortal races. Fyrakk seeks to corrupt the newly born World Tree Amirdrassil and forcibly infuses its guardians with shadowflame that painfully burns away their mind and soul and turns them into [Fyrakk's loyal slaves](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream). Between killing and consuming his own forces and mocking the Dragon Queen Alexstrasza for her past torture and rape, Fyrakk sought to engulf all life on Azeroth in shadowflame to turn them into his tortured servants.
* [Kargath Bladefist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist) is the founder and leader of the Shattered Hand clan whose insatiable love of pain created one of the cruelest orcs in existence. Kargath led his clan to torture new recruits either to death or until they began to enjoy the suffering, and he would [gleefully torture victims](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician) by flaying, burning, or having them eaten alive, all the while injecting them with poisons that kept them conscious and aware for as long as possible. Caring nothing for the orcs, Kargath became the only non-warlock to join Gul'dan's Shadow Council and sell out his race into enslavement to the Burning Legion. Reveling in the Old Horde's cruelties, Kargath successfully led the genocide of the [arakkoa](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdPeople) save for a handful of outcasts, and stayed behind on Draenor to keep the more savage clans in line. [Betraying master after master](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder) over the following decades, Kargath ultimately settled on following Illidan Stormrage in exchange for ruling over the Fel Horde and further corrupting the last of his race to satiate his never-ending sadism.
* [Nekros Skullcrusher](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFrom) is a bitter [warlock](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight) and the second-in-command of the Dragonmaw clan. Entrusted with the Demon Soul, Nekros led the capture of Dragon Queen Alexstrasza, torturing her [physically](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture) and [psychologically](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape) with the artifact.

Bloodthirsty to the extreme, the savage rituals and [Monstrous Cannibalism](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonstrousCannibalism) that define the trolls can all be traced back to Mueh'zala's never-ending demand for sacrifices.

Mueh'zala corrupted the once heroic Helya into a dark goddess to command the Jailer's armies and tricked the troll Vol'jin into naming [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WarcraftSylvanasWindrunner) as the Horde Warchief.

As you can see, there are 4 Orc characters who are approved as Complete Monsters by TV Tropes and are featured on this list (Gul'dan, Blackhand, Kargath Bladefist and Nekros Skullcrusher) but there are absolutely no Human characters who are considered to be Complete Monsters.

Hayk Ertaşkıran, 20 kur’a askerlikten hasta olarak dönmüştür. Hayk’ın Karaköy’de bir ayakkabıcı dükkanı vardır. Kendisine yüklü miktarda Varlık Vergisi salınır. Kanser hastası ve yatalak olduğundan hakkını savunamaz, dükkanı evi tamamen boşaltılıp bir tek yattığı yatak bırakılır. İki gün sonra Hayk eşine; “Saint Antuan Kilisesi’nde başımıza gelen felaketler için dua et ve dönüşte Beyoğlu’ndan bir tavuk al da gel canım çekti” der. Eşi duasını yapıp satın aldığı tavukla eve döndüğünde Hayk’ın cansız bedeniyle karşılaşır. Hayk, eşi kiliseye gittiğinde mutfaktaki ocak da alındığından boşta olan havagazı musluğunu açarak hayatına son verir.

Aslında Hayk Ertaşkıran’ın hikayesi Varlık Vergisi’nin özetidir. Başka söze gerek olmamasına rağmen biraz daha altını doldurursak:

Varlık Vergisi azınlıklara yönelik bir siyasettir ve bu siyaset kendisini bir “ekonomik” uygulamanın arkasına gizler. Cumhuriyet tarihinin kara sahifelerinden biri olan Varlık Vergisi, İkinci Savaş sırasındaki hükümetin bilinçli politikaları sonucunda fiyatların artışı, sermaye birikimini hızlandırma adına, karaborsa ve vurgunculuğa göz yumulması neticesinde -buna kısaca yağma da diyebiliriz- hükümete karşı oluşan tepkileri savuşturmak ve harp sırasında oluşan aşırı kazançların vergilendirileceği gibi masum bir “iktisadi” gerekçe ile çıkarılıp, savaşın verdiği fırsattan yararlanarak (sadece bir ayağı sermayenin “Türk”leştirilmesinin sağlanması olan) azınlık mensubu vatandaşların biçilmesine ve ekonomik ve kültürel olarak silinmesine, yaşam araçları elinden alınarak göç etmekten başka bir seçenek bırakmamaya yönelik İttihatçı gelenekten gelen etnik temizlik politikasının kırbacıdır. Yasa tamamen siyasidir ve pre-kapitalist/melez bir sosyal formasyona tekabül eden uygulamayı temsil eder.

Hükümet Varlık Vergisi öncesinde yaptığı mükemmel bir manipülasyonla kendisine yönelen ve/veya yönelebilecek tepkileri azınlıklara yönelterek savuşturmayı becermiş, bu yasayla, azınlıkları iktisadi ve kültürel olarak yok ederek homojen bir yapı şekillendirme fırsatını yakalamıştır. Çünkü ülkenin geri kalanında etnik temizlik yapılmıştı, ama İstanbul hâlâ Rumlar, Ermeniler ve Yahudilerden arındırılamamıştı.

EKONOMİK VE KÜLTÜREL JENOSİD
Varlık Vergisi kanun gömleği giydirilmiş zulmün adıdır. İkinci Savaş yıllarında gayrimüslim vatandaşları ödeyemeyeceği derecede borçlandırıp, onların her şeylerine el konularak tüketilmelerine ve yaşamlarını devam ettiremeyecek duruma düşürerek, bu coğrafyadan ayrılmalarına/kovulmalarına yönelik siyasetin aracıdır. Hacizlerde bütün eşyalar yağma ve müsadere edildikten sonra kira devir haklarının dahi hacze konu olması gayrimüslimlere hiçbir şekilde yaşama hakkı tanınmamasının göstergesidir. Varlık Vergisi özel bir operasyondur. Operasyon devlet, basın (i), özel sektör ve halk işbirliğinin mükemmel örneğidir.

Varlık Vergisi siyasî bir karardır ve amacı gayrimüslimlerin birikimlerine el konulması, sermayenin el değiştirmesi ve müsaderesinin çok ötesindedir. Bu yasayla gayrimüslimlerin her şeyleri müsadere edilerek ekonomik ve kültürel jenosidi amaçlanmıştır. Sermaye transferi, siyasî kararın sonuçlarından sadece biridir. Azınlıkların belleğinde Saraçoğlu’nun “haraçoğlu” olarak hatırlanması nedensiz değildir. Varlık Vergisi Kanunu’nun bu temel özelliği, dönemin gazetelerinde yer alan bazı mezat ilânlarıyla belgelenmiştir.

Çok kısa zamanda örgütlenip sonuç alınması, bir anda gayrimüslimlerin donuna varıncaya kadar soyulması, önceden bir hazırlığın ve stratejinin var olduğunun göstergesidir. Donuna varıncaya kadar derken ironi yaptığımız sanılmasın; genç kadınların çeyizlik donları da el konulanlar arasındadır.

Verginin amacını, en iyi verginin mimarları bilir; onlardan biri de Saraçoğlu’dur. Saraçoğlu verginin, gayrimüslimlerin piyasadan silinmesinin ötesinde amaçlarının olduğunu gizlememektedir. Saraçoğlu memleketi olan Ödemiş’in Gölcük yaylasında yaptığı konuşmasında “Biz bu vergiyi Türk tüccarını ön plana çıkarmak için ihdas ettik. İstanbul’da dolaştığım zaman her nereye baktım ise azınlıkların çok gösterişli işyerlerini gördüm” der.

İstanbul Defterdarlığı’nın haczedip içindeki büyüklü küçüklü 150 domuzla birlikte mezata çıkardığı (27 Şubat 1943 günlü Tasviri Efkâr) domuz çiftliği de bu tasarımın bir örneğidir. Çiftliğin satışının ikinci bir ilanının olmamasından satışın gerçekleştiğini rahatlıkla söyleyebiliriz. Tesis bir Müslüman tarafından satın alınmıştır.

Varlık Vergisi vasıtasıyla, en ağır vergi tahakkuk ettirilen Barzilay ve Benjamen firmasının kullanılır durumdaki gemilerinin Deniz Yolları’na devredilip Haliç’te çürümeye terk edilmesi de yasanın siyasi karakterinin aslolduğunu belgelemektedir.

1530 LİRALIK BORCA 24 BİNLİK HACİZ
Zaten azınlık sermayesi, Kemalistlere göre rasyonel sermaye değildir. Nesim Kızı Kade’nin 1530 liralık borcuna karşılık 24 bin lira değer konulan gayrimenkulünün haczedilmesi (14 Mart 43 Yeni Asır ) uygulanan politikanın boyutunu ortaya koymaktadır. Kışın ortasında sobaların, perdelerin dahi haczedilmesi yeterince açıklayıcı olsa gerektir.

Varlık Vergisi’ni vermeyen avukatların barodan çıkarılması da bu çerçevede alınan kararlar arasındadır.

Daha dramatik örnekler de vardır: Erman ve Emil’in cenaze arabasına dahi el konulup mezatta satılmıştır (Tasviri Efkâr 6 Kasım 1943 ). Cenaze arabasına el konulup mezatta satılmasının mantığı nedir? Hangi amaca hizmet etmektedir? Cevap verelim: Azınlıklara bu coğrafyada yer yoktur. Azınlıklara bu coğrafya ölülerine dahi dar edilsin ki her şeylerini bırakıp bu ülkeden gitsinler. Hiçbir izleri de kalmasın. Cako Ventura’nın bir küçük duvar aynasına (Yeni Asır. 24 Aralık 1943 ) varıncaya kadar her şeylerine el konulması, hatta çocuk oyuncaklarının bile hacze konu olması kanunun ne kadar acımasız olduğunun göstergesi olarak da okunabilir.

O yıllarda sağlık sorunlarının çok vahim olmasına rağmen, Varlık Vergisi’yle doktorların muayene eşyalarına da el konulması (ii), azınlık mensubu doktorların ve sağlık kuruluşlarının hizmet veremez duruma getirilmesi, azınlık cemaatlerinin hastanelerine ağır vergiler konulması, vergisini ödeyemeyen avukatların barodan kayıtlarının silinmesi bu yasadan amacın gelir elde etmek olmadığının, yasanın, azınlıkların bu coğrafyadan silinmesinin aracı olduğunu kolayca söyleyebiliriz.

Varlık Vergisi ile müsadere edilip mezatta satılan gayrimenkullerin tahsilâta oranının Faik Ökte’nin verdiği bilgilere göre yüzde 1 civarında olması da amacın siyasi niteliğini daha açık ortaya koymaktadır.

Keyder, Varlık Vergisi’yle verilen mesajın açık olduğunu söyler: Gerçek ekonomik etkisi ne olmuş olursa olsun, bu uygulamanın verdiği mesaj açıktı ve İkinci Dünya Savaşı sonrasında, birçok gayrimüslim İstanbul’u terk etti. Mesaj azınlıklarca alınmıştır. Kitleler halinde bu coğrafyayı terk edecekler ya da 1964 yılında olduğu gibi kitleler halinde sınır dışı edileceklerdir.

VERGİNİN SOSYAL HİZMETİ!
11 Kasım 1942 tarihinde kabul edilen bu yasayla “verginin yüzde 70’i İstanbul’daki mükelleflere tahakkuk ettirilmiştir ve bu mükelleflerin yüzde 87’si gayrimüslimdir. Müslümanlar ise yüzde 7’lik bir oranı oluşturmaktadır. Oysa bu yıllarda Müslüman-Türk şir­ketlerde bir patlama yaşanmıştır. Anadolu eşrafı ve büyük top­rak sahipleri, hükümet politikasıyla savaş yıllarında yaratılan suni darlıktan hatırı sayılır bir birikim sağlamıştır ve bu biriki­mine İstanbul’da yeni kanal aramaktadır. İstanbul Ticaret ve Sanayi Odası’na 1942 yılı içinde 8 bin yeni kayıt yapılarak üye sayısı 28 bine yükselmiştir. Yeni girişimcilere hazır pazar… Uygulamacılardan Ferit Melen’in “Varlık Ver­gisi sonrasında tüm Anadolu tüccarı örneğin Koçlar, Sa­bancılar bu hadise ile kendilerine yer bulmuşlardır. Bu hadisenin böyle de sosyal bir hizmeti olmuştur. Varlık Vergisi ile tüm amaçlar bir arada çözülmek istenmiştir” sözleri bu olgunun ifadesidir.

Varlık Vergisi İttihat Terakki geleneğinin devamı olarak Cumhuriyet tarihinin azınlık karşıtı politikalarının en önemli pratiklerinden biri olan ‘1934 Trakya olayları’, ‘vatandaş Türkçe konuş’ ve ’20 kur’a ihtiyatlar uygulaması’ndan sonra azınlıkların bu coğrafyada artık bir yeri olmadığını gösteren önemli siyasi uygulamalardan biridir. Anlayamayanlara 6/7 Eylül olaylarıyla 1955 yılında daha net olarak anlatılacaktır. Azınlıkların seçeneği, ülkeden gitmek ve her şeylerini burada bırakmaktır. 1948’de İsrail’e gitmek isteyen Museviler de her şeylerini bırakma karşılığında ülkeden çıkabilme izni alabilmişlerdir. Kıbrıs olayları bahane edilerek etabli Rumlar da 1964’te her şeyleri bıraktırılarak sınır dışı edilirken, Yahudilerle aynı kaderi paylaşacaklardır: ‘0 Kilo. ‘0 Dolar!’

Bir resmi gazete olan 13 Kasım 1942 tarihli Ulus’ta, Fazıl Ahmet Aykaç’ın, Son kararları Düşünerek başlıklı Varlık Vergisi ile ilgili yazısındaki ürkütücü sözleri de bu kapsamda ele alabiliriz: “Bilelim ki yapılan şey, dün haddini bilmemiş olanlara bir ceza olmaktan ziyade onu yarın unutacaklara karşı muazzam bir ihtardır”.

Bir Genelkurmay Askeri Tarih ve Stratejik Etüt Başkanlığı yayınında ise şu ifadeler yer almaktadır: “İttihat ve Terakki’nin 1908’den itibaren başlattığı millî iktisat politikasına rağmen, Osmanlı sanayiinde gayrimüslimlerin ve yabancıların hemen hemen tamama yakın etkinliklerinin, 1915 yılında bile (abç) azaltılamadığını söylemek yanlış olmaz. Bu durumun Birinci Dünya Harbi ve sonrasında kısmen; Cumhuriyeti kuran kadro tarafından gerçekleştirilecek millileştirme faaliyetleriyle de 1930’lardan sonra derece derece düzeltileceğini belirtelim” sözleri de politika devamlılığını işaret etmektedir.

Genel kanının aksine Varlık Vergisi’yle sadece azınlık burjuvazisi hedeflenmiş değildir. Varlık Vergisi’yle azınlıkların tümünün tüketilmesi hedeflenmiştir. Başka türlü yoksulların barakalarına varıncaya kadar el konması nasıl izah edilebilir? Gayrimüslimlerin en yoksul kesimlerinden seyyar satıcı, hademe, şoför gibi günlük çalışanlardan 26 bin kişi vergilendirilmiştir. Taban 500 liradır. Bu rakam çok yerde Müslümanların tavan ödemelerine denk gelir.

Bu vergiye tabi tutulan İstanbul’daki toplam mükelleflerin(!) yüzde 25’ini oluşturan seyyar grubunda (15 bin 413 kişi), kişi başına 624 lira vergi düşer. Ücret karşılığı olarak çalışan hizmetli grubu (10 bin 991 kişi), toplam mükelleflerin yüzde 18’ini oluşturur ve kişi başına 626 lira düşer. Mülksüz gruplar, mükelleflerin (!) yüzde 43’ünü temsil ederler. Çoğu İstanbul’da Balat, Hasköy, Kuledibi, İzmir’de Keçeciler, Çankaya, Mezarlıkbaşı ve Irgat Pazarı gibi fukara mahallelerinde yaşayan proleter, alt, orta tabaka veya esnaf Musevilere, aralarında çok işadamı, tüccar, zengin bulunsa dahi, genel olarak zenginleştiniz demek yanlıştı.

İTTİHATÇI POLİTİKANIN KRİSTALİZE HALİ
Varlık Vergisi orantısızdır: Bu vergiye ilişkin bir incelemede, orantısızlık açıkça görülmektedir, İstanbul’da 100’ün üzerinde rastgele seçilen aynı güçte olan mükelleflere uygulanan verginin, firmaların gücüne kıyaslanmasında şöyle bir sonuca ulaşılmaktadır:

Etnik köken Kapital gücü-vergi ilişkisi
Ermeni tüccarlar yüzde 232
Yahudi tüccarlar yüzde 179
Rum tüccarlar yüzde 156
Müslüman-Türk tüccarlar yüzde 4.94

Bu yasa her şeye rağmen bu coğrafyada tutunabilen azınlıkların zor kullanılarak ekonomik gücünün kırılması, azınlıkların tüketilmesi için zincirleme ekonomi dışı politikaların uygulanması, ekonomik ve kültürel jenosidin pratikleri olarak İttihatçı politikanın kristalize olmuş halidir.

Vergi, ruhunda 1915 jenosidinin genlerini taşımaktadır. Başka bir ifadeyle 1915 jenosidi ruhunun 1942’de hortlamasıdır. Her ikisinde de savaş fırsatı değerlendirilmiş, savaş ortamının güç dengeleri hesap edilmiştir. Savaş süresince “tarafsızlık/savaş dışılık” politikası ile birlikte uygulanan şantaj politikasının verdiği hareket serbestliği, vergiyi uygulamada hükümete eşi bulunmaz bir fırsat ve kolaylık sağlamıştır.

Bu durum Boston’da yayınlanan Ermeni gazetesi Hairenik’in 30 Haziran 1943 tarihli sayısındaki Canavar Yine Zincirlerinden Boşandı başlıklı makalesinde dile getirildi.

Varlık Vergisi aynı zamanda İttihatçı Paşa İnönü’nün Lozan’da yarım bıraktığı ya da gerçekleştiremediği azınlıklardan kurtulma projesinin uzantısı olan İttihatçı geleneklere uygun bir projedir.

Komisyonlardaki etkin görevlerde Tophaneli Bican Bağcıoğlu, Tevfik Amca, İTC Katib-i Mesulu ve Hamallar Kahyası Reisi ve 1915 Soykırımında Konya’nın yerlisi Ermenileri ve Konya’da konaklayan Ermenileri ölüm yollarına süren Mahmut Ferit Hamal gibi eski İttihatçıların bulunması İTC’nin mutemet şeyhülislamı Hayri Efendi’nin oğlu Suat Hayri Ürgüplü’nun bütün komisyonlara hakim olup kontrol görevinde bulunması, bu kadroların yarım kalan bir hesabı görme operasyonu olarak görmemizde ayrı bir ipucudur. Bu eski İttihatçıların gerek komisyonlardaki tavırları gerekse süreci takipleri sırasındaki eylemleri de bunu doğrulamaktadır.

Aşkale’ye sevk gününe ilişkin Faik Ökte’nin söyledikleri bu konuda başkaca yorum yapmamıza gerek bırakmamaktadır; “Sevk günü eski İttihatçılardan birkaçı bana müracaatla kafileden Sekip Adut ve benzeri birkaç kişinin sağ salim dönüp dönmeyeceğini sordular”.

Vergiyi kabul eden mebusların listesinde gerek meclis bileşenleri gerekse kabul oyu veren meclis üyelerine ilk bakışta Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa elemanlarının çokluğu Varlık’ın 1915’le ilişkisini bir başka açıdan da netleştirmektedir. Varlık Vergisi Kanunu oylamasına katılarak kabul oyu verenler arasında azınlık mebuslardan Ermeni Berç Türker (Keresteciyan), Rum İstamat Özdamar (Pulluoğlu) da bulunmaktadır.

VERGİNİN EKONOMİYE FAYDASI OLMADI
Verginin acımasızlığına dayanamayan, itiraz eden ve görevden ayrılan müfettişler de vardır: Faik Ökte, “Fatih şubesinde çalışan İhsan Arat mükelleflerin ıstıraplarına, gözyaşlarına birkaç aydan fazla dayanamadı. Bu işten affedilmesini istedi. Şubesi munzam vazife olarak Rifat Onat’a verildi. Bütün varlığı satılan mükelleflerin çalışma kampına gönderilmesine en evvel Ekrem Türkay itiraz etti. Dinlemediler. Türkay ayrıldı. Şubesi Vefik Pirinççioğlu’na (iii) verildi”. Varlık Vergisi bürokratları yönetim basamaklarını en hızla tırmanan bürokratlar arasındadırlar.

Ekonomik bir politika olmadığından, verginin ekonomiye bir faydası olmamıştır. Toplanılan gelirler üretken olmayan harcamalara gitmiştir. İktidar bu olanağı iktidarını sürdürebilmek için günlük harcamaların finansmanında değerlendirmiştir. İki yıllık bütçelerin karşılaştırması bunu açıkça göstermektedir.

Varlık Vergisi’nin uygulamacısı Faik Ökte’nin, devlet tarafından icra yoluyla satışa çıkarılıp el değiştiren malların yeni sahiplerinin, savaş koşullarında mal darlığı ve karaborsa nedeniyle fiyatlarının yüksek olmasından dolayı normalin üstünde fiyatla satıldığını söylemesi, Türk ve Müslüman kesimin ihtikârına göz yumulduğunun ifadesidir.

Devlet harcamalarının yüzde 38’i ve milli gelirin yüzde 3,5’i, sanayi ve hizmetler kesiminde yaratılan hâsılanın yüzde 8’i oranında tahsilât yapılmasına rağmen emisyon hacminin daralmaması, haczedilen mallar dolayısıyla (iv) piyasada mal bolluğuna rağmen fiyatların düşmemesi, Müslüman tüccarın ihtikâra devam etmesinin göstergesi olarak okunabilir.

Varlık Vergisi borçlarını ödeyemeyen İzmirli mükellefler Sivrihisar’daki zorunlu çalışma kamplarına sevk edilirken, Başvekilin memleketi Ödemiş’te bayram vardır. Ödemişliler Başvekilin onuruna eğlenceler düzenlenmektedir.

Ekonomideki zorlukların aşılması(!) için konulduğu söylenen verginin kahramanı muzaffer başvekilin yurttaşları üzerinde kazandığı zaferin anısı abideleştirilmektedir. 2 Eylül günlü Tasviri Efkâr gazetesi İzmir Ödemiş yolunun her istasyonunda halk tarafından eşine nadir tesadüf olunur tezahüratla karşılandığını birinci sahifeden ilan ederken, Saraçoğlu anıtının bir gün önce açıldığını da şöyle müjdelemektedir: Başvekille beraber: İzmir’den Ödemiş’e, Saraçoğlu anıtı dün açıldı (Tasviri Efkâr 2 Eylül 1943)

Aynı dönemde zor ekonomik koşullar altında olunmasına rağmen İnönü büstlerinin de açılışlarında da geri kalınmamaktadır. 1943 bütçesine, Atatürk anıtı proje masrafları olarak 250 bin lira konduğunu da belirtelim.

SUÇ ORTAKLARI YARATILDI
Bu arada iktidar – vaziyetin icaplarından dolayı – kendisine suç ortakları yaratmaktan da geri kalmamaktadır. İktidarına destek ve verginin meşrulaştırılması için memurlara birer kat elbise ve birer maaş ikramiye verilmesi de unutulmaz. Rejimin üst düzey bürokratları da paylarını lojman olarak alırlar. Bugünkü adıyla Namık Kemal Mahallesi (eski adıyla Saraçoğlu Evleri) o günlerin eseridir.

Tüketiciler de unutulmaz; ucuz yiyecek için onlara da buğday alımı yapılır. Bu dönemde tek tip ya da makbul vatandaş yaratma mekanizması olarak kurulan Halkevleri’ne ayrılan kaynaklar ise birkaç önemli bakanlık bütçelerinin toplamından fazladır.

Varlık Vergisi’yle yapılan harcamalardan söz açılmışken iki kalem harcamadan daha söz edelim: Biricisi; 1943 bütçesine Varlık Vergisi’ne ait her türlü ücret ve harcamalar olarak 500 bin lira ödenek konulmuştur. İkincisi, gazetelere 299 bin 888 lira ilan bedeli olarak yapılan ödemedir. Faik Ökte, “İlan dolayısıyla gazetelerle aramızda sinsi bir mücadeledir başladı. Nihayet zimmî bir anlaşmaya vardık. Borçlunun kesesinden ödenen bu tevziatın yekûnu 299 bin 888 liradır.” diye açıklar.

Gazetelere ödenen bu miktar sadece İstanbul’u kapsamaktadır. Gazeteler ya da gazeteci partililer/partili gazeteciler, iktidara desteklerinin(!) karşılığını mağdurların kesesinden almışlardır.

Varlık Vergisi’nin 14’üncü maddesi müsaderenin kanunlaştırılmasıdır. Bu madde hükmü ile vergi mükellefi kılınarak vergi yükü bindirilen birinin borcuna karşılık neredeyse bütün akrabalarının malları teminat olarak haczedilebilmektedir.

KIRIMIN KÜLTÜREL BOYUTU
Yasayı bilmeyen bir hukukçuya bu madde okunursa şaka zanneder. Kırımın bir de kültürel boyutu vardır. Bu vergi neticesinde başlayan kitlesel göç, çok önemli bir kültür birikiminin yok olmasına, kültürel iklimin çoraklaşmasına neden olmuştur. Kayıp sadece azınlık cemaatlerinin kaybı değildir söz konusu olan, kültürel soykırımdan azınlık cemaatleriyle birlikte Türkiye de kaybetmiştir.

Kültürel yıkımın bir veçhesi de, entelektüel gerilemedir. Azınlıkların içine düştüğü yoksulluk, çocuklarının eğitimine de yansımıştır. Gayrimüslimler çocuklarını okutamaz duruma gelmemişlerdir. Çoğu gayrimüslim öğrenci okullarını bırakmak zorunda kalmıştır.

Varlık Vergisi uygulaması 1948 Birleşmiş Milletler Evrensel İnsan Hakları Beyannamesi’nde soykırım tanımının manevi ve maddi unsurlarını içermektedir: Eylemin “ulusal, etnik, ırksal veya dinsel bir grubu kısmen veya tamamen ortadan kaldırmak amacıyla” yapılmış olması, sözleşmede maddi unsur olarak tanımlanan azınlıkların yaşam araçlarının ellerinden alınması ve bir kısmının toplama kamplarına sürülmesi “grubun bütünüyle veya kısmen, fiziksel varlığını ortadan kaldırılacağı hesaplanarak, yaşam şartlarını kasten değiştirmek”, azınlıkların savaş ortamında yaşama araçlarından koparılarak açlığa mahkûm edilmeleridir. Bu açıdan da Varlık Vergisi insanlığa karşı işlenen bir suçtur aynı zamanda.

Türk solunun Varlık Vergisi’nin komprador burjuvazinin tasfiyesine yönelik olduğu ve bunların tırpanlandığı değerlendirmeleri boşlukta kalmaktadır. İttihatçılığın devamı olan Kemalizm’den beslenen “sol” için bu değerlendirme normaldir. Ancak Marksist iddialı iktisatçıların da konuya aynı açıdan bakmaları ya da azınlıklara yapılan bu uygulamayı görmezden gelmeleri anlaşılmazdır. Komprador retoriğini sürdürenlerin, ecnebi mükelleflerin(!), konsolosluklarının baskısı ile Müslümanlara uygulanan oranda vergilendirilmesine -daha doğrusu vergilendirilmemesine (v) karşı suskun kalmaları ayrı bir konudur. Vatandaşların etnik kökenine göre ayırıp bir bölümünü içerideki yabancılar olarak nitelenmeleri düşündürücüdür.

ÇALIŞMA KAMPLARI YASANIN SİLAHIYDI
Borcunu ödeyemeyen mükellefler 27 Ocak’tan itibaren toplama kamplarından alınarak Aşkale’ye gönderilmeye başlanır. Sabiha Sertel, Aşkale’de yaşananları anılarında şöyle nakleder; “Gidenlerden gelen mektuplar, Allah’ın çayırında, çadırlar, barakalar içinde yaşadıklarını, yiyecek bulmadıklarını, her gün sabahtan akşama kadar taş kırdıklarını bildiriyordu. Kanun, Nazi metotlarıyla yürütülüyordu. Şükrü Saraçoğlu, efendisi Von Papen’den, Hitler’den iyi ders almıştı… Verginin bu şekilde alınması hem içte, hem dışta kötü tepkiler yaptı. Dünya basınında Türk toplumu için yüz kızartıcı yazılar çıkıyordu. Bütün gürültülere, baskılara rağmen Varlık Vergisi, hükümetin istediği geliri sağlamadı. Ekonomik durum daha da kötüleşti”.

Mükelleflerin (!) çalışma kamplarına alınmaları yasanın en önemli silahlarından olduğu için sürgünler çalışma kamplarında kötü şartlarda çalışmakta ve barınmaktadırlar. Üzerlerinde baskı olmaması düşünülemez; nitekim anlatımlar ve raporlar bunu doğrular niteliktedir. “Aşkale’ye gönderilen mükellefler kafilesine yirmi kur’a gayrimüslim ihtiyatların silâhaltına alınmaları sırasında onların komutanları olan Albay Cevat Çetin komutanlık yaptı[ğını]” da eklersek Sürgünlerin yaşadığı dehşeti belki daha iyi anlayabiliriz.

Aşkale’de tutsaklardan biri sıranın biraz dışına çıktığında komutan albayın hışmına uğrar, Albay tutsağa şiddetle vurur, aldığı darbeden dişleri dökülen tutsak yerden dişlerini toplar, tutsağın, dişlerini kanıt olarak saklayacağını anlayan albay dişleri zorla elinden alıp taşla ezer(…) Albay başka bir zaman nutkunu şu sözlerle bitirir: “Neden şikayet ediyorsunuz? Bizim köylülerimize bakın bize ürünlerinin dörtte üçünü vermek zorundalar [Toprak mahsulleri vergisi kastediliyor] yine de şikâyet etmiyorlar.” Genç bir Ermeni ise sırasından ayrılmadan şunları söyler: “Bize çiftçileriniz gibi davranmanızdan memnun olurduk, onlar dörtte üçünü veriyorlar ama çiftliklerini, tarlalarını, hayvanlarını ve evlerini ellerinde tutuyorlar ve çalışmaya devam ediyorlar, bizim için ise (bize gelince) bizi tamamen çökerttiniz, yok ettiniz. Bizden işlerimizi, evimizi ve paralarımızı aldınız. Burada biz dünyada hiçbir ülkede olmadığı bir şekilde suçlu muamelesi görüyoruz. Suçluların barınma ve yiyecek ihtiyacı karşılanır. Sadece bize hiçbir şey vermemekle kalmadınız, zorunlu ihtiyaçları karşılamak için tuttuğumuz küçük şeyleri de alıyorsunuz, bu yüzden açlıktan ölüyoruz.”

Aşkale’de zorunlu çalışmaya tabi tutulan mükelleflerden 21’i (kamplarda 10 ay kalan Parseh Gevrekyan’a göre 25’i) yani yüzde 1,5’i kampta hayatını kaybetti. Ölenlerin dini ve etnik kimliği farklı da olsa azınlıklar cenaze törenlerini birlikte yaptılar. “Sürgünler naaşları tahta üstüne koyarlar ve tarlalara gömerlerdi; yanlarında da boş bir şişenin içine ölünün isminin yazılı olduğu bir kağıt parçası koyarlardı. Papaz yoktu. İçlerinden birisi papazlık görevi yapar, cenaze ilahisini okurdu ve sonradan trisagion (üç kere kutsal duası).” (O Politis (Ο Πολίτης), Atina, Şubat 1993)

Ne yazık ki Aşkale’de ölen Varlık Vergisi kurbanlarının Kamhi, Elyazar, Romano, Kostantinidis, İosif Topaloğlu,Yeorgio Topaloğlu, İsak Antoniadi, Konstandinos İatru ve Delioğlu’nun dışında diğerlerinin kimliklerini hâlâ bilmiyor olmamız acıtıcı bir gerçeği ifade etmektedir. 20 kur’a uygulamasında ölen kurbanlar kimsenin aklına gelmemiştir. Bu kurbanların da sayıları ve kimlikleri dahi bilinmemektedir. İktidar bu ölümleri doğal ölüm saymaktadır. İzmir’de de uygulama sırasında vergi kurbanlarından dördü vefat ettiğinden çalışma kamplarına sürülemediği ifade edilmiştir (16 Ekim 1943 Anadolu). Bu dört kişinin ölümü bu zulüm şartlarında doğal ölüm sayılabilir mi?

Kendisine uygulanan verginin miktarı karşısında, Zonguldak Devrekli Kasketçi Andon kalp krizi geçirerek anında ölmüştür.

Ya kamplardaki kötü yaşam koşullarında etkilenerek sağlığı bozulanlar ve birkaç yıl içinde hayatını kaybedenler… “[D]eri ticaretiyle uğraşan 51 yaşındaki amcama bütün servetinden fazla bir meblağ vergi olarak tahakkuk ettirilmişti. Onu ödeyemedi. Çalışma kampına gönderildiğinde şeker hastası idi. Kamptan geri döndüğünden bir buçuk yıl kadar sonra kalp krizi ve tıbbi komplikasyonlar sonucu vefat etti. Birçok aile dostumuz birkaç gün veya hafta dayanamadan kamplarda vefat ettiler.”

Kamptaki yaşam koşulları çoğu tutuklu için doğal ölüm sebebi oluşturmaktadır. Bu durumdan birçok raporda söz edilmektedir:

“Kötü yaşam koşulları ve tıbbî olanakların yetersizliği nedeniyle Romano adında bir Yahudi, kısa süren bir hastalık ve yardımı istenen doktorun da hastayı muayene etmeyi reddetmesinin ardından 28 Mart 1943 tarihinde bir ahırda saman döşek üzerinde vefat etti. Bazil Konstantinidis adlı bir Rum çalışma kampından dönerken Erzurum’da vefat etti. Kendisine tıbbî yardım yapılmamıştı. Bazil Konstantinidis, vefat etmeden önce Erzurum’dan karısına yolladığı son mektupta, mücevherler dâhil olmak üzere elde mevcut son varlıklarını satmasını, bundan elde edeceği para yetişmezse eşten dosttan borç alıp vergiyi ödemesini istedi. Kocasının vefat ettiğinden haberdar olmayan eşi son ziynet eşyasını satıp zorlukla parayı toplayıp vergiyi ödedikten ve makbuzu aldıktan sonra memura Erzurum’daki yetkililere telgrafla verginin tamamen ödendiğini bildirip kocasının serbest bırakılmasını istemelerini rica etti. Vergi memuru kadına çok üzgün olduğu ancak kocası birkaç gün önce vefat ettiği için telgraf çekemeyeceği cevabını verdi.”

KAPISINA TAHSİLDAR GÖNDERECEK MÜKELLEF KALMADIĞINDA…
3 Aralık 1943 günlü Başbakanlık onayında sürgünlerin evlerine dönmesine izin verilir

Dâhiliye, Maliye, Nafia Vekâletlerine,

Varlık Vergisi borçlarını kanunun tayin ettiği müddet içinde ödemediklerinden dolayı çalışma mükellefiyetine tabi tutulmuş olan vatandaşların, aile ve iş muhitlerinde çalışarak bakiye borçlarını ödeyebilmek imkânlarını bulabilmeleri için aileleri nezdine iadeleri tensip olunur.

Arzederim. Dâhiliye, Maliye, Nafıa Vekâletlerine yazılmıştır.

Başvekil

Eve dönüşte tesadüf vapur iskelesinde İstanbul defterdarına rastlarlar, aynı vapura binerler. Sürgünler Faik Ökte’yi tanıdıklarında vapurun üst güvertesinden ona doğru eğilerek hep bir ağızdan “Yaşasın Cumhuriyet!” diye bağırırlar. Faik Ökte: “Bu uğultu ne zamandır cefa çeken bedbaht bir kitlenin alabileceği en büyük intikamdı…”

Varlık Vergisi bir muhalif oya karşılık 310 kabul oyuyla 15.3.1944 tarihinde kaldırılır.

Ancak Varlık Vergisi’yle ilgili mezat ilanları 15.3.1944 günü dâhil devam eder. Suat Kehribar (Salamon)’a ait bakır fabrikası hissedarlık hukukunun satışı 15.3.1944 Tasviri Efkâr da yer alır. Düzeltme ilanlarına rastlamadığımızdan, vergi kaldırıldıktan sonrada satışların sürdüğünü anlıyoruz. Satılamayan menkul ve gayrimenkuller artık hazine malı olmuştur, bunların mükelleflere iadesi söz konusu değildir.

Verginin kaldırıldığı oturumda konuşan toprak ağası Emin Sazak’ın sözleri 16 Mart 1943 günlü Tasvir Efkâr gazetesinde şöyle nakledilmektedir: “Hükümet bu kanun lahiyasile… vergi borçlarını affetmiş olabilir. Fakat bunlar halkın nazarında birer cani, yurdumuza ihanet etmiş kadar maznundurlar. Bir gün millet intikamını alacaktır.”

Varlık Vergisi tahsilatı ertesi yıl bitti “öngörülen hedefler” gerçekleşmedi. Ekonomi göstergeler daha da kötüleşti. Ancak bu kez kapısına tahsildar gönderecek mükellef kalmadığı gerçeğinin altını çizmek gerekir.

Sait Çetinoğlu
(i) 1942 yılı CHP iktidarında muhalif medya yok. Tamamı merkez medya. Medyayı kontrol eden Basın Konseyi’nin başında Cemal Paşa’nın özel kalemi Ulus Gazetesinin başyazarı Falih Rıfkı vardır. Falih Rıfkı için tek gerçek, devletin gerçeğidir: “Hakikatin ne lüzumu var devletin hakikati yeter!”

(ii) Dişçi Nubar Peştamalcıyan’ın dişçiliğe ait alet ve edevatın mezatta satışı, 10.4.1943 Tan, Doktor Yaranusyan’ın doktor muayene eşyalarının mezatta satışı, 8.3.1943 Tasviri Efkâr

(iii) Vefik Pirinççioğlu, Diyarbakırdaki 1895-96 Ermeni kırımlarının sorumlusu Arif’in torunu ve 1915’te Diyarbakır’daki Ermeni Soykırımı sorumlularından Feyzi Pirinççioğlu’nun oğludur.1960 darbesi sonrası kurulan İnönü restorasyon hükümetinde bakanlığa getirilecektir.

(iv) Gayrimüslimlerin mallarını saklamadıkları, ticarethanelerinde bulunan malların haczedildiği gazetelerdeki haciz listelerinden anlaşılmaktadır. Zaten Milli Koruma Kanunu’nun denetimi de her an gayrimüslimlerin üzerindedir. Kaçırmaları söz konusu değildir. Gümrükteki ambarındaki mallar, akreditifler dahi hacze konu olmuştur

(v) M [Müslüman] grubunun vergileri gayet hafifti, hatta bir kısım mükellefler kendilerinden neden bu kadar az vergi tarh edilmiş olduğuna hayret etmişlerdi. Halide Edip bu meyandadır. Verginin ilanı günü sevincinden kurban kesen M mükellefler vardır” Faik Ökte, Varlık Vergisi Faciası s.129

De momento esto es todo lo que he hecho, podría actualizar el tutorial del laboratorio secreto y las diferentes zonas especiales para los diferentes finales. 

Quiero agradecer al SR tazas por darme parte de la información necesaria. Tiene una de las guías más rápidas que hay y muchas partes, por no decir casi todo, es de su run. Dejo el enlace del video aquí. No soy propietario de este tutorial. Pero a mí me ha sido más cómodo de jugar teniéndolo en texto que en su guía. Espero os sirva y nos vemos.
