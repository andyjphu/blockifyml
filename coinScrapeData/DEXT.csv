I fell victim to a sophisticated scam and LOST EVERY SINGLE PENNY I HAD SAVED OVER THE PAST YEAR.

What's even more alarming is that SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN YOUTUBE INFLUENCERS WITH BLUE TICKS, including XAI317k, XAI207, and XAI799K, PROMOTED THIS COIN, which appears to be a MALICIOUS SCAM.

I'm deeply concerned that MANY OTHERS MAY HAVE ALSO FALLEN VICTIM TO THIS SCAM due to their promotion. I urge everyone to EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION and VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF ANY INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES before taking any action.

**Update:**   
Here is an update guys if you go on Dextools io and search this Fuc\*ing coin XAI317K it launched on 31st Dec. 2024, and within five days it goes to 230 Million Market Cap (starting price: 0.000362 and now it's on $2) but now you are thinking that I am promoting this coin but you know what I am watching this coin and it stuck with only 250 holders and holders number are not increasing and one more thing when you see DEXT Score it's only 1.  
(Note: Now they remove all above tokens and now they are making lot of Coins/Token with the starting name XAI, and after that add random numbers, you can check it on Dextools or Dexscreener)

I don't know what to say further, if there is any expert who can explain to me what the hell is going on here. I am assuming that these M.F are scamming lot of people and putting all the money into this coin, Am I right?"

"Day 11 - Trending on DEXT, Marketing Expenses, and 20% price increase!!",The_Operation_Phoenix,1apifc8,2024-02-12 21:31:53,39,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Operation_Phoenix/comments/1apifc8/day_11_trending_on_dext_marketing_expenses_and_20/,Original_DaddByB,,"Today was exciting from a publicity perspective as we were trending on DexTools for the majority of the day. Our rank fluctuated up and down the top 10 trending list for most of the day. Why does this matter, you may ask? Well, DextTools as most know is where we get our charts from. It's one of the top websites which provides price updates, hundreds of thousands of investors watch the “hot” tokens. How did we get there you my wonder? Well a lot of it depends on how many people visit the OPHX page. They monitor the traffic, so it is extremely beneficial to constantly check the price. If you want more information about how it all works, please come into TG and there is a post that has been pinned by the mods. 

Another exciting item is Shaun posted a Twitter message informing the crypto community that OPHX is ready to start taking applications for the launchpad. Some people may not be familiar with a launchpad, but this a place for new tokens/projects to gain exposure at launch. Pinksale is another popular launchpad for tokens, so we should see some similarities between that website and what is being developed by the OPHX team. The major benefit to the OPHX launchpad compared to others would be the added benefits of a well-built community (OPHX community) already developed to expose the new project to. They would also have the benefits of Shaun/Joe’s YouTube marketing team to help with launching their own crypto projects. In return the fees paid by the new crytpo team could be added to our LP, helping to strengthen the price. As a community, we also gain the benefit of seeing new projects before they are launched and having a KYC process to protect us against bad actors.

This extra exposure on Dext and the Twitter posts has helped us show some major price action. One person purchased over $6000 today! Based on CG it looks like we are up almost 20% over the last 24 hours; trading volume is about $70,000 over the past day which is pretty impressive for a token as new as ours. We need to keep this strong momentum going into Phoenix Friday, where we will hear about the newest updates. Joe already teased today on Twitter that we can officially check off another roadmap item. I am excited to see which one it is.  

Today’s Interesting Items 

* The community burned another 10,000 tokens voluntarily, bringing us up to almost 61,000 burned. 
* Money was moved for the first time from the marketing wallet, and the developers have already started to show their transparency and explaining where it's been going. $4,500 was used for Trustwallet updates. The first payment of $30k was made to the CEX, with the next portion coming soon. I LOVE THE TRANSPARENCY of the team for explaining everything that they do. 
* Our biggest whale being tracked went from 565k to 540k, dropping roughly another 5% today. This is one of our sell walls, so we still have more work to go, but we have already eaten up over 1Million that has been dumped by this whale. 
* Of the 57 WhiteList members, we lost 2 more over the last 4 days. Bringing us to 47 out of 57 WL members still holding strong. Personally, I find this overly impressive to see so many early investors still have faith in the project.  

Overall, a really good day. The price is up and the exposure is growing. We have a handful of whales who are respectively offloading their bags at a pace we can still grow. I continue to be excited about the project, especially with how fast the founders are getting things done. On a side note, we have grown to almost 150 people here, and only a couple people posting. Feel free to start threads and ask questions. If something happens in TG during the day that I may miss, please post it here. Let's make this a place where investors can come and quickly get their questions answered and updates without having to scroll through 1000 missed TG messages. "

6 Key Points That Will Help You Analyze Fundamentals of Any Crypto Project Before Investing - in 15 Minutes!,ethtrader,17a4qpm,2023-10-17 14:14:02,3,0.64,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/17a4qpm/6_key_points_that_will_help_you_analyze/,pythonskynet,Warning,"TL;DR - ignore the Donuts FUD, it will recover. Know come to the post: 6 important points such as **idea, tech, community, team, marketing** and **key statistics** will help you analyze any potential crypto projects and complete the fundamental analysis before investing in them.

Analyzing crypto projects is not easy, unless you are a rich degen who blindly jumps into any shitcoin he sees. It's time-consuming, and I am going to make it easy and quicker for you. These six points will help you conduct the research and quality checks as quickly as possible:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kes1sk0pzsub1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=890890b08ee0769ebc01a6716598a1aece20ae1f

# 1: IDEA

* **What's the basic concept of the project?** You can't evaluate a crypto project without knowing what it does in the first place.
* **Does the project solve any problems?** If more people have to use this crypto project (mass adoption), what kind of real-world problems does it solve (blockchain problems included)?

# 2: TECHNOLOGY

* **Quickly analyze the basic specifications:** Is this a new Layer 1 blockchain or a L2? Is it a Dex or a Dapp? First, understand where it sits in the cryptosphere. It will help you know about its competitions.
* **Development progress:** Learn about their development phases, when they launched, how many phases they have passed, and how many are left. Does this project have a working product or service? Are they in beta or alpha? History shows that projects with a cryptocurrency or token but no real products or services don't end well often!

# 3: TEAM

* **Team background check:** Visit LinkedIn to learn more about team members' experiences and accomplishments, including the founders'. Don't forget to see how old those accounts are, how well connected they are, and whether they connected their original social media handles.
* **Are those pictures of team members real?** Nowadays, lots of scam projects use AI to create fake pictures of team members to show themselves as legit. A reverse image search on Google can help you with this.

# 4: KEY STATS

* **Marketcap:** Knowing the market value of the token gives you a better perspective on the future potential of the project.
* **Price History:** See how the price of the cryptocurrency has been performing in its lifetime. If a token's price is not doing anything in multiple years, it will not magically change overnight!
* **Supply Check:** Look at the circulating supply vs max supply. A low circulating supply means a large number of tokens are yet to be released. This will add more selling pressure if there's not enough demand to accompany it.

# 5: MARKETING

* **Media mentions:** Did any media sites, like news websites, write about this project? Any major blogs writing about them? Whether it's a paid article or not, it doesn't matter; the project has to get some visibility out there on the internet.
* **Frequent news and updates:** Is the project releasing the latest updates as news releases every now and then? Are they posting frequent updates about their projects on their blog? Communicating with investors is vital for any project to succeed. Potential investors who are studying a project always want to know what's happening behind the scenes before investing, and so do you!

# 6: COMMUNITY

* **Activity on social media channels:** Are the Telegram or Discord channels filled with life or are they dead? Good activity usually represents real followers and not just non-engaged numbers.
* **Community sentiment:** Where there is smoke, there is fire. Listen to what the community says. While a lot of information can be false or perceived as ""FUD,"" it can also be valid. Listen to what they are saying and see where the smoke comes from.

While a solid fundamental background check will always take time, these six metrics will help analyze projects in less than 15 minutes. All of these usually only require the use of 3-4 websites: the official website, Coingecko, LinkedIn, and sometimes Dextools' DextScore and Audit reports.

**Update:**

# DONUT is a winner amongst other RCPs due to its decentralized nature. Donut is on mainnet and Gnosis chain, not on Arbitrum Nova. EthTrader community can find a way outside of Reddit, independently - but others like rcc and fortinteBR can't!

That score measures the overall reliability of the project based on key protocol metrics such as transactions, holders, and pool liquidity. While the DEXT score can be a great starting point, I recommended going deeper into researching the contract details, which is where the GoPlus Security check comes in handy.

To demonstrate the usefulness of the said tool, I picked a random contract from the main page and analyzed it. At first glance, everything seemed okay, but upon closer inspection using the tool, I found that the contract owner could modify taxes, pause transfers, and blacklist users, so i quickly decided to move on and find something else. This information is crucial for investors to know before investing in the project.

In conclusion, DEXTools GoPlus Security check is a powerful tool that can help investors mitigate risks in the DeFi space. By providing a detailed overview of a smart contract's features, investors can make informed decisions and avoid scams.

The tool is accessible to all web3 users, even those with no technical knowledge, and makes the due diligence process simpler and easier. In a world where ""code is law,"" DEXTools GoPlus Security check is a valuable asset for DeFi investors to protect their investments.

"$REDDIT - $3.5M MC, huge upside potential following 4Chan at 30M",CryptoMoonShots,14ef8nz,2023-06-20 12:10:13,13,0.88,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/14ef8nz/reddit_35m_mc_huge_upside_potential_following/,IfItBleedsItBreeds,ERC-20 Token,"**Token Name: $REDDIT**  
  
**Market Cap: $3.5M**  
  
Okay so you might have heard or seen the $REDDIT token in the past - it was launched back on the 1st of May, it ran up hard and hit 1.5M as an ATH then died out and has laid dormant now since like the 10th of May.  
  
Well - the community was still around and the dev Snoo seemed to still be around and I noticed that some price action was hitting on it. Was starting to look like a slow mooner.  
  
However - now momentum is picking up and it keeps getting higher highs and higher lows and seems to be making a very nice revival comeback. Now its still very under the radar as I've only seen it mentioned a few times here and there - Maythous and Pow gave it a call out on their TG channels which brought some volume to it and more eyes, but still - mainstream does not know this is even coming back to life. Eric Cryptoman is involved and helping push as well. ETH Trending has been paid for, Dext trending at #3. New website about to be launched.  
  
**Long story short - The upside on this is huge..... and here's why:**  
  
$4Chan - YES.... idk if you've noticed but $4Chan just recently had a revival.... they cracked 30 MILLION!!!! Funny thing is... this is eerily similar to $REDDIT, it also launched at the same time, right after $REDDIT launched and had success, $4Chan was created and also did a similar ATH. Monkey see, monkey do.  
  
So... $REDDIT actually came first, this gives it first to market.  
  
The charts are FREAKISHLY similar now and it's giving me stupidly bullish vibes.  
  
Reddit is actually larger than 4Chan reach, it also has had a LOT of big controvery and time in the news with various things. This also gives it a big edge.  
  
IT'S A HIDDEN GEM right now. $3M Market Cap vs 30Million Market cap on $4Chan. (look at the charts and tell me what you see).

Well, they have a native token, $DEXT, which has an insane revenue model btw, but what really sets is its subscription tiers.

\- P&L tracker  
\- Wallet info/tracker  
\- Price alerts on telegram, mail, or whatever  
\- 12 hot pairs

I'm probably forgetting some, there's plenty of stuff.  
In my experience though, the best part of this is the chance to access a private Telegram group with all the guys holding plenty of tokens. This means that everyone in that group has some fine knowledge to share, and it's really wonderful how much you can learn just by reading their talks.   


I've been hanging in the crypto world for years, and it's uplifting to see that there are still some high-quality communities where so much alpha is being given away on a daily basis.

[GUIDE] How to (partially) avoid getting rekt when investing in DeFi,AltcoinTrader,120tfxu,2023-03-24 14:33:57,49,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltcoinTrader/comments/120tfxu/guide_how_to_partially_avoid_getting_rekt_when/,mcccsm,educational,"The rise of DeFi has made the crypto space more vulnerable to hackers, with a whopping $3.8 billion stolen in 2022 alone. 

As DeFi protocols lack regulation and auditing, investors need to be cautious and conduct proper due diligence before investing. While researching can be challenging for non-tech web3 users, there are tools available that can help mitigate risks. 

While aping around, I came across DEXTools ""Go Plus Security"" tool, and this was a complete game changer to me, as I could scan through tokens at 10x the average speed, being efficient and extremely precise.

The GoPlus Security check on DEXT provides investors with a comprehensive overview of a smart contract's features. It covers everything from buy/sell taxes to contract verifiability and blacklist capabilities. The tool is designed to assist in analyzing the state of a smart contract and detect any potential malicious lines of code. 

To access the GoPlus Security check, anyone can go to the pair page on dextools.io and find it in the left-center part of the screen, beneath the DEXT score. That score measures the overall reliability of the project based on key protocol metrics such as transactions, holders, and pool liquidity. While the DEXT score can be a great starting point, I recommended going deeper into researching the contract details, which is where the GoPlus Security check comes in handy. 

To demonstrate the usefulness of the said tool, I picked a random contract from the main page and analyzed it. At first glance, everything seemed okay, but upon closer inspection using the tool, I found that the contract owner could modify taxes, pause transfers, and blacklist users, so i quickly decided to move on and find something else. This information is crucial for investors to know before investing in the project. 

 In conclusion, DEXTools GoPlus Security check is a powerful tool that can help investors mitigate risks in the DeFi space. By providing a detailed overview of a smart contract's features, investors can make informed decisions and avoid scams. 

The tool is accessible to all web3 users, even those with no technical knowledge, and makes the due diligence process simpler and easier. In a world where ""code is law,"" DEXTools GoPlus Security check is a valuable asset for DeFi investors to protect their investments.

DEXTools Integrates Floki's FlokiFi Locker Protocol! (details within post),Floki,11nqde6,2023-03-10 09:15:38,20,1.0,4,https://i.redd.it/wkzlqhb17xma1.png,NotAWhaleQQ,:FlokiFi: FlokiFi,

So, what is $DEXT?

It's the utility token of [Dextools.io](http://dextools.io/), the leading defi analysis and trading tool platform. Holding $DEXT gives you access to premium features on the platform and Dext Force Ventures, the $DEXT whale & investment club.

But $DEXT is more than just a utility token. It lets you benefit from Dextools' revenues and growth simply by holding it. And let me tell you, Dextools has diversified revenue streams that keep the company profitable and growing.

How does DEXTools make money?

\- Banners in app (with 10m+ views/month)  
\- DextForce ventures fees and profits  
\- Fees paid by project to update social info on-app  
\- Fees from on-platform multi-dex aggregator

But DEXTools doesn't just use these revenues to sustain operations and development. They also use them to expand the DEXTools ecosystem and perform acquisitions. In addition to these revenue streams, all payments made in $DEXT (the cheapest option) for updating social info on-app are burned, while payments made in $BNB and $ETH are used to cover marketing and expansion activities.

And that's not all. The aggregator revenues are fully used to buy back $DEXT from the market and burn it. These two activities create a constant buy pressure, currently in the 500k to 1M $DEXT per month.

Quite amazing, isn't it? 😎

With a market cap of just $23m, a price of $0.23, and a circulant supply of 101M, $DEXT has a lot of room for growth. And with a locked supply of 39M and 0% to founders, it's a fair and ethical investment imho.

There are currently around 15k $DEXT holders, but with over 1M monthly unique users, the potential for growth is enormous!

Dextools is truly a diamond in the rough in the crypto space. As the leader of its niche, it continuously delivers improvements and listens to the community. With 30% buy pressure per month from organic revenues, it's a profitable and growing company without selling tokens!

So, Floki community, if you're looking for an ethical and profitable investment in the crypto space, $DEXT is definitely worth considering. With incoming features that will only increase its utility and adoption, the future looks bright for DEXTools and $DEXT."

And that's not all. The aggregator revenues are fully used to buy back $DEXT from the market and burn it. These two activities create a constant buy pressure, currently in the 500k to 1M $DEXT per month.

Quite amazing, isn't it? 😎

With a market cap of just $23m, a price of $0.23, and a circulant supply of 101M, $DEXT has a lot of room for growth. And with a locked supply of 39M and 0% to founders, it's a fair and ethical investment imho.

There are currently around 15k $DEXT holders, but with over 1M monthly unique users, the potential for growth is enormous!

Dextools is truly a diamond in the rough in the crypto space. As the leader of its niche, it continuously delivers improvements and listens to the community. With 30% buy pressure per month from organic revenues, it's a profitable and growing company without selling tokens!

So, Floki community, if you're looking for an ethical and profitable investment in the crypto space, $DEXT is definitely worth considering. With incoming features that will only increase its utility and adoption, the future looks bright for DEXTools and $DEXT."

Amplifier Withdrawals will be possible from Sunday 19th February @ 00:00 UTC,maxxfinance,10vgxpe,2023-02-06 15:18:40,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/maxxfinance/comments/10vgxpe/amplifier_withdrawals_will_be_possible_from/,MAXX__Finance,,"**MAXX Launch Update**

Hello MAXXians! We are extremely excited to see the project now trading on our first DEX, and our users using the staking system and earning rewards. Apart from a hiccup with the amplifier withdrawals, the protocol is working exactly as intended.

**Flash Stats!**

280 MAXX Holders (+4000 users with FreeClaims)

4,950+ Stakes created already

Performance since launch +450%

6,991,938 MAXX Tokens burned

$746K Market Cap.

97/99 DEXT Score Rating

As you may be aware, Amplifier withdrawals are not possible at this time. This was unplanned, and down to the fact that we reduced the length of the Amplifier from 60 to 40 days before its launch. Unfortunately, one instance of ‘60’ was left in the contract and was missed in audits. This means that withdrawals are not possible until the full 60 days have passed since the Amplifier launched (another 14 days from now). This of course caused immediate concern amongst Amplifier participants and ourselves at the time of launch, as we all wanted to withdraw our reservations instantly and get staking.

We immediately put our dev team to work to come up with a solution, but as the contracts are immutable it’s impossible to simply edit the unlock time. Technically, it may be possible to deploy a new contract that would interact with the old one, and allow for withdrawals sooner.  But after careful consideration, we have made the decision as the community to leave the Amplifier to run the full length and wait the extra 14 days.

The reason for this decision is that the existing contracts are thoroughly tested and audited. Writing and deploying a new contract, would need several days of testing, and ideally a full security audit which could take over a week. This may open us up to vulnerabilities if rushed, and we don’t want to put any users' funds at risk. Therefore we are leaving this to run the length of the original immutable contract, meaning that Amplifier Withdrawals will be possible from Sunday 19th February @ 00:00 UTC.

We can only apologize for this mishap, but it's just one of those things that can happen.  All reserved MAXX tokens are safe and will be fully accessible in two weeks time. As a reminder, all Amplifier participants will be getting a 10% Bonus when they stake any of their daily reservations.

We hope you understand and we appreciate your support for the project. Remember we are a community project and your input is very valuable to us.

We are at the very start of a long journey with MAXX, the project has only just been born. We have a lot of exciting things to be added to the roadmap soon!

MAXX to the moon, fudders get rekt! LFG MAXX

1️⃣ A $DEXT premium account (hold 1,000 $DEXT)  
2️⃣ A want to make your life easier.

All jokes aside, let's dive into the method  ⬇️

&#x200B;

First up, with your wallet holding $DEXT, you're going to head over to: [https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/wallet-info/](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/wallet-info/)  
There, you can paste your main wallet address (You can always connect more after)  
After pasting, you should see your assets.  
Go ahead and click save and you're ready to go.

As you can see I'm using a random wallet ""DEXtools test"", but my three saved wallets are tagged below. Why do I do this?  
So I know which wallet I'm using, detectable by name and color.  
This feature really shines once we move over to a chart and start aping.

With my wallets saved, I decide to ape into a project.  
However, there are usually multiple issues to track that entry  
\- What was my real entry price?  
\- How many tokens  
\- What % am I up or down?  
Usually, a block explorer feed looks like a mind field:

Even as good as it is, why would you waste time with this when there's something easier and faster?

With my wallet saved, my entry shows up clear as day.  
Every buy OR sell will be illuminated for me. No more cross-referencing.  
But wait I can go an extra mile.  
See how I'm hovering over 'add to my positions' button?  
That's available once you favorite a pair!

Clicking it opens up an entry form that's auto filled based on your tx.  
IMG: [https://i.imgur.com/EuJzPkL.png](https://i.imgur.com/EuJzPkL.png)  


![img](k44vuozxorda1 ""
"")

I can change it if the no. of tokens was incorrect. After clicking save, my position is now saved and tracking my % profit up/down, entry price & current value.

Don't forget the entry marker on the chart, extremely useful to visually identify your entries and take profits.

So why do I love this method so much?  
Because it allows me to implement my take-profit strategy without even thinking.  
I need ZERO manual entry and zero effort to track trades or entries.  
I can't tell you how easy this has made my aping.   


 And that's a wrap fellas, let me know if this was useful to you 🤝"
Why i use DEXTools above Dexscreener or similar for my charts and tracking,AltcoinTrader,1097dtg,2023-01-11 10:27:00,102,0.95,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltcoinTrader/comments/1097dtg/why_i_use_dextools_above_dexscreener_or_similar/,mcccsm,educational,"Almost everyone I know uses dexscreener, without realizing the benefits of Dextools.To benefit, you must have a premium dextools account (Hold 1k DEXT) - around $150 as of now.

There are two main features which draw me to DEXTools: 1️⃣ Instant trade tracking 2️⃣ Wallet tracking As mentioned, you'll need a premium dextools wallet to use these tools.

You can start by adding your wallet to your saved wallets list.

→ Head to the wallet info tab

[https://i.imgur.com/ZjWYUUO.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZjWYUUO.png)

Once there, you can proceed to save up to 500 unique wallet addresses over a multitude of chains.

Let's run over an example:

Below I've added a random wallet I found and saved it as a saved wallet. Now that it's saved under the name 'example', look what happens: ↓

[https://i.imgur.com/9zuOvZl.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/9zuOvZl.jpeg)

When I go to the $MAGIC/WETH pair it recently traded, my saved 'example' wallet's transaction is automatically recognized as a saved wallet.

Now how would I normally record that transaction? Manually? with an external aggregator?

Why not directly through the dapp itself?

[https://i.imgur.com/LBDq4sw.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/LBDq4sw.jpeg)

By favouriting a pair, you're able to add on-chain transactions directly into ""your positions""

Navigating to your transaction, you'll see a + sign

Once added, it'll be shown as so ↓

You can manually edit or add new positions incase you missed your tx, but it doesn't stop there

[https://i.imgur.com/dz8EpPB.png](https://i.imgur.com/dz8EpPB.png) [https://i.imgur.com/F8A1qHV.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/F8A1qHV.jpeg)

As is constantly preached, I often take my initial out of a trade at the 2x mark or below, to protect my capital.

But how do I know how much I'm in the profit? Instead of closing your winning trade position on dextools, simply change the amount.

Example ↓ Say I actually entered the aforementioned trade at 30c, meaning I'm up 100%. I decide to sell 450 magic (half my stack, now my initial)

To keep track of my trade accurately whilst taking profits, I can edit my position while keeping the exact same entry.

This also operates as a DCA tracker.

If you're slowly building a position, it can be incredibly tedious to keep track of your average entry price.

Why waste time with these alternative methods, when a tool like this is right in front of you :? To be transparent, I'm not sponsored by DEXTools, I just genuinely think this tool is under appreciated.

I use it actively when I trade and is the reason why I prefer it over competitors platforms.

Hopefully I showed you something you didn't know!"
Why I think that DEXToolsis the best DEFI analytic tool and one of the most under-rated projects. An overview 👇,AltcoinTrader,101c6vd,2023-01-02 08:06:27,188,0.92,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltcoinTrader/comments/101c6vd/why_i_think_that_dextoolsis_the_best_defi/,mcccsm,DEX,"If you don’t already know, DEXTools is an app and ecosystem for traders that provides info about all the decentralized markets.

Assimilating blockchain data into one comprehensive UI allows you to have a clear vision about your trading, investments and market state.

It aims to provide users with such a comprehensive, powerful and intuitive experience that their impression of decentralised trading will no longer be a challenge, but an opportunity available to everyone! 

The platform offers a wide range of features, most of them are free and accessible to anyone, while for more experienced traders, it also offers some premium features that can be accessed simply by holding a certain amount of $DEXT or by paying a monthly subscription.

[https://i.imgur.com/BTBADYK.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/BTBADYK.jpeg) \[DEXT PLANS\]

These are the features which draw me to DEXT:

* Hot Pairs
* Big Swap Explorer
* Wallet Tracker
* P&L Tracker

I found very useful the first three ones for discovering new low cap gems and for following whales' trades, while the last one for keeping track of my plays. 

In addiction, when you find a low cap token, you can check key informations such as:

* Marketcap
* Liquidity
* Creation date
* Reliability Score
* Supply
* Holders
* Community Trust

Thanks to these information, you can quickly scan the token you are looking at!

Now let's speak about $DEXT.

Its the Utility Token that you can use for:

* Accessing premium features of the app through holding or monthly subscription
* Accessing Dext Force Ventures, the whale & investment club
* \-Benefit from Dextools revenues and growth by simply holding it

[https://i.imgur.com/GuRPF7Y.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/GuRPF7Y.jpeg) \[$DEXT CHART\]

has a wide range of revenues:

* 10+ Marketing banners on-app
* DextForce ventures fees and profits
* Fees paid by project to update their social info on-app
* Fees from on-platform multi-dex aggregator

That's what I call sustainable business model!

Update social info revenues are used partially to cover marketing and expansion expenses ($ETH – $BNB) and everything paid in $DEXT (cheapest option) is instead directly burned.

The aggregator revenues instead are fully used to buyback $DEXT from the market and burn it. 

In the last 3 months:

* \~7.5k $DEXT (1 $ETH) daily from Aggreg
* \~25k DEXT (4 $ETH) daily from USF

At the current prices that leads to 1M $DEXT (\~1% of the supply) burnt per month, with an impact on the price of the buybacks of 30%/month.

150 ETH of buy-pressure month by month!

Recently DEXTools burned 2,182,000 $DEXT in one shot!

This not only proves the assumptions above, but shows that the team is not just talking. It’s silently, but surely keeping the promises.

Find me another company in crypto that is leader of its niche, profitable and growing even in bear, without selling tokens, continuously delivers improvements and listens to the community, uses 150ETH of revenues to buyback on a fixed-supply token and sits at $15m capitalization! 

Another important metric to look at is the number of unique addresses. In the recent 3 months, there has been a 4% growth, even during bear market.

[https://i.imgur.com/bUIToK6.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/bUIToK6.jpeg) \[$DEXT UNIQUE HOLDERS\]

It’s another confirmation that more and more people are interested in having $DEXT to benefit from the services offered by the platform or because they consider DEXTools’ token a valid investment. 

During Sep-Nov Dextools totalized 21.89M total visits from 1.1M unique users. This leads us to state that only 1.2% of DexTools users own some $DEXT tokens. More interestingly, it shows that there are more than 2x unique visitors to Dextools than Ethereum active addresses.

[https://i.imgur.com/5z9Ru4P.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/5z9Ru4P.jpeg) \[[DEXTOOLS.IO](https://DEXTOOLS.IO) WEBSITE METRICS\]

DEXTools continuously delivers improvements and listens to the community, in fact they will realease these features:

* API for gathering Dextools data
* Dext Launchpad
* Dext liquidity pools
* Price bot telegram

The project has already grown hugely with a mission to “do for DeFi what cryptographic blockchains did for value and information transmission.” If it maintains the accuracy and decentralization of its services, it will be one of the most essential tools ever in the crypto space."
