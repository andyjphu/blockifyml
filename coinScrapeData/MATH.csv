He was at a first grade level in kindergarten and now that he’s in first grade, he’s at a second grade level. His math scores are in the 95th percentile so he gets bored with what they’re teaching him and I end up teaching him extra stuff to keep him interested. He actually likes doing math so extra stuff isn’t an issue for him, he’ll sit with his sister and watch her do her homework. 

The school gave us extra programs like IXL and boddle but they’re very simple and don’t teach him anything. I also tried Khan Academy but he gets bored of it fast, I think it’s  just too structured like a class for him.

What are some good sites or programs that he could benefit from? "
A different way to look at fat burning and muscle loss,fasting,1i9xfzn,2025-01-25 16:23:49,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1i9xfzn/a_different_way_to_look_at_fat_burning_and_muscle/,PurpleCustomer9791,Discussion,"Hi,

I've been lurking here for a while, but wanted to share something that rang a clear bell in mind about how our bodies actually burn fat. I just completed a 15 day fast (longest fast I've done) and am down 19lbs, feeling amazing too after a couple rough days where i didn't have my hydration and electrolytes in check yet. Anyway, while doing my usual routine of obsessing about details and diving deeper into the subject, I stumbled onto something that I wish I'd known during my previous fasts. 

Turns out there's a scientific limit to how fast your body can actually burn fat, this feels kind of obvious in a way bit is rarely part of the discussion as far as I have seen. When I did a little math with this info the results surprised me and it changed how I'm approaching fasting.

 Quick background on me: I'm 260 lbs, about 40% body fat (working on it), and I keep seeing  conflicting advice and practices about exercise during fasting. Some people seem to keep working out fairly hard, others tend to just rest or get low exercise and there are always tons of questions on how to handle it. I found that kernel of information really crystallized it for me, so I thought I’d share.

 Your body can only burn fat at a certain speed - like a pipe that can only let so much water through. For each pound of fat you have, you can burn about 31 calories from it per day (science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45, I believe the high end would be when you are very overweight and have plenty of easily accessible fat). That's not a ""daily allowance"" you can save up - it's more like a speed limit you can't break.

Here's how it breaks using myself as an example:

\* I've got about 104 lbs of fat (260 × 40%)

\* Each pound can release 31 calories per day maximum(assuming 31 as the rate)

\* That means I can burn up to 3,224 calories from fat per day

\* Breaking it down further: that's about 134 calories per hour(the speed limit, not a cumulative total), but this isn’t all available for you to spend, you have to subtract your basal metabolic rate first.

\* Or about 2.2 calories per minute

 **The Muscle Loss Warning**

Here's the important part - if you push past your fat-burning limit, your body doesn't just magically find more fat to burn. Instead, it goes ""Oh, you need more energy? Let me grab that from your muscles real quick."" Not exactly what most of us are aiming for.

 Think of it like this: Your fat stores are like a slow-drip IV that can only deliver a certain amount of energy per hour. If you suddenly need more energy than that drip can provide (like during an intense workout), your body has to find that extra energy somewhere. Guess what's protein-rich and full of energy? Your muscles.

 Some real numbers to put this in perspective:

\* Let's say I go for an intense workout that burns 600 calories in an hour

\* My fat can only provide 134 calories that hour

\* My base metabolism needs about 100 calories that hour(you need to figure this number out, calculators all over the internet)

\* That leaves a 366-calorie deficit

\* Those calories HAVE to come from somewhere - hello, muscle breakdown

 

It's actually worse than just losing muscle mass. When your body breaks down muscle for energy, it:

\* Is less efficient than burning fat

\* Can stress your kidneys (they have to process the broken-down muscle protein)

\* Makes you feel like garbage (that workout ""high"" quickly becomes a crash)

\* Can take longer to recover from

 

What This Actually Means

My body needs about 2,400 calories just to keep me alive each day (BMR). That leaves me roughly 824 calories (3,224 - 2,400) for extra activity. Spread across 24 hours, that's about 34 calories per hour for exercise or whatever. The 34 kcal per hour during sleeping is lost capacity.

 If I burn an extra 34 calories per hour during waking hours on top of my BMR (2,400 kcal/day), my total daily energy expenditure would be approximately **2,944 calories per day**. This would result in burning about **0.84 pounds of fat per day- anything above this means burning muscle.**

**It's important to remember that the less fat you have, the lower these thresholds become.**

 At first I was disappointed that this number is so low, it gives me a very minimal overhead for exercise. But it explains why:

\* People lose muscle when they exercise too hard while fasting

\* Some folks feel great with light walking but crash after gym sessions

\* You can't ""make up"" for a lazy day with one intense workout, you don’t get to “save up” unused fat energy, it’s an on demand system with a limt.

 

 The Numbers

For every pound of fat you have:

\* 31 calories per day(again, science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45)

\* 1.29 calories per hour

\* 0.022 calories per minute(realistically this is the most pertinent number)

 Multiply those by your pounds of fat to get your limits. Just remember your body needs its baseline calories first (BMR), and what's left is w

To be clear about the muscle thing: you'll always lose a tiny bit of muscle during any fast, but the goal is to minimize it. Staying under your fat-burning limit helps do that. The really aggressive muscle loss happens when you push too hard and force your body to break down muscle for fuel, I for one don't want to go lift weights just to lose muscle... Exercise is important to let your body know to protect the muscle, because you are still using it, but there are clear limits.

I’ve probably made some mistakes in here and obviously there are probably some more factors that could be accounted for, like a lower BMR while fasting, differences in BMR from day to night, and rounding to the hour not being super representational… But I would love to hear what people think of this.

Thanks

How do you realistically move an asteroid in career mode?,KerbalSpaceProgram,1i9xdof,2025-01-25 16:20:57,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1i9xdof/how_do_you_realistically_move_an_asteroid_in/,DefconExile,KSP 1 Question/Problem,"I have a contract for moving a Class D asteroid into gilly orbit and then docking a space station on that asteroid , at first glance this seemed challenging but worth the reward with a 1.8 million payout and 620,000 advance. but the issue now seems to be that the amount of money it’s going to cost me to even move such an asteroid is going to outweigh the whole reason I’m doing the contract in the first place 

I created a probe that had a grabber on it equipped with a rhino engine and 2 large tanks but after docking with the asteroid it decreased my delta v by 90% due to the mass.

After doing the math it will take me roughly 2000-2500m/s of delta v to get the asteroid to gilly which means I will need to send up 4 more rockets with grabbers to give me a total of 5 rhino engines @ 500m/s giving me my required  fuel. The first rocket cost me 473,000…. So that means that if I send 4 more my total cost is at 2,365,000.

So I’m just curious is there any better way to achieve such a task while actually making money? this whole predicament has caused me to download a bunch of tech tree mods to add more powerful rockets but I have again ran into the same problem of them costing too much and outweighing to reward from the contract. What’s the point of these contracts if they aren’t even viable in base game let alone with 60 mods installed "
AITA for not accepting an apology from my friend after an insensitive joke?,AITAH,1i9xcjm,2025-01-25 16:19:36,1,0.99,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9xcjm/aita_for_not_accepting_an_apology_from_my_friend/,ThrowAway360-365,Advice Needed,"My friend James and I met through our math class, and it has been sort of a ""frenemy"" situation. We see each other in only two classes, the other being P.E. At times, he has shown a romantic interest in me (I think) by saying I'm his type, always moving next to me, and getting a bit jealous when anybody other than him is helping me with something. However, when these things occur, I typically forget about them almost immediately, as he will jump to doing things that make me believe this interest is just in my head. It is important to note that we sit across from each other in our math class, and we have sat at the same table a total of three times now. I am the only girl at this table and have been every other time as well. Before we got to the point of being ""friends,"" I felt as though he was treating me like I wasn’t even a person. This led to multiple arguments, crying on my part, me ignoring him entirely, and eventually, moving my seat to a different table to avoid any future conflict. He apologized for this time, and since then, we have moved past it. I have now confided in him about something I hadn’t even told some of my closest friends: my biological mother left me about two years ago. I felt comfortable enough to tell him this, as I also told another friend (Noel) at the same time.

The situation at hand began about two days after he had apologized to me for a different incident, where he was rude once again and belittled me over my times for track. I was in our math class, and everything was going well. Everybody at the table, including myself, was making jokes and having fun. One of our mutual friends, Noel, decided to make a joke about me and James' relationship, stating that we were like an ""old married couple."" Since everybody was joking that day, I decided to go along with it and just laugh, saying that I would ""never want to be old and married to James."" Noel continued with the bit, asking James how many kids we would have, and he replied with ""25, obviously."" I said I would have 0 with him, as I wouldn't ""want to ruin my bloodline."" James began bragging about his physical characteristics, saying that he's tall and conventionally attractive. I then said that I found it hard to believe that James would ever have relations with a woman. This resulted in him saying, ""Like I don’t have a mom?"" Noel then chipped in with another joke, stating, ""You have sex with your mom, James?"" After this, the table began laughing, as did I, even James did. Then, he looks over to me and says, ""Why are you even laughing, \[my name\]? You don’t even have a mom!""

Almost immediately after he said this, the table went quiet, and I just said, ""Really?"" Everybody continued on like this for about a minute or so before I decided to leave the table and go to another one momentarily to talk with one of my friends. The bell rang about two minutes into talking with her, and then I went back to my assigned table to pack up my stuff. As I was packing up, I heard James calling my name next to me. I told him I didn’t want to talk to him and continued to tell him to stop talking to me while he was apologizing. Being upset and blocking him out, I didn’t quite get to process his apology, but I do remember he said something along the lines of, ""It was really stupid of me, and I don’t know why I even said that."" Then, I asked him a question, asking him to name one thing I’ve ever said that was even close to that level of cruelty. He wasn’t able to, but he told me he no longer wanted to continue the conversation and didn’t wish to speak to me for a while. I told him nothing but, ""Okay,"" and we both left afterwards.

Two classes went by, and I happened to have my last class of the day with Noel. I decided to ask him if I was in the wrong for not wanting to hear his apology as we were walking to class together. I told him that I thought it was irrational that, despite all of this, James didn’t want to speak to me and was mad at me, and not the other way around. Noel said, ""You both responded in a correct way, but James isn’t mad at you. He’s just mad at himself, and after you left, I told him he went a little too far, and he was mad at me too. I think he’s just beating himself up about it right now.""

The next day, during our P.E. class, I decided I would talk to him to try and solve things, as I hate the idea of conflict overall and value him as a friend. He was playing football, but I tried to call out his name and get him to speak to me. He ended up ignoring me, so I eventually just gave up. Then, in our math period, he continued to ignore me, and so I ended up giving up once more. However, when I gave up on speaking to him, that’s when he decided he wanted to talk to me. For example, I would ask Noel a question about the work, and James would reply instead. Because of this sudden turnaround, I was a bit upset and began ignoring him. I was frustrated with the fact that he plays this game of push and pull frequently and asked him why he was doing it—ignoring me. He replied with, ""Every time I talk to you, I always make you cry or hurt your feelings or both. I don’t want this to keep happening, so it’s best if I just ignore you."" I tried to convince him that the statement he made just then wasn’t true, saying that I’ve only ""cried like, 2-3 times."" He told me that was 2-3 times too many, and for the rest of the period, I just kept annoying him with stupid questions like, ""What’s the worst thing anybody’s ever said to you?"" I wasn’t acting like myself out of frustration and discomfort. I tried to bring Noel into this, which only made him upset because we are both his friends, and he doesn’t want to be in the middle. He just said he wishes we could stop arguing or stop being friends.

At the very end of the period, I just gave him a summary of everything he’s done to me thus far, and he asked me if I felt as though he was being mean to me today by ignoring me. I replied with, ""Yes,"" and then we left. I asked Noel if he thought I should apologize to James for everything in our last class of the day, and he told me I should.

This situation overall is very sticky because I don’t know what to do or if I’m in the wrong. All my girlfriends say that James is just a jerk and I shouldn’t apologize to him, but Noel said I should, and I feel as though I am responsible in some way."

I’m looking at starting a small GPU hosting setup and wanna know if this is even worth doing or if I need a serious reality check.

I’d start with 3 RTX 5090s (when they come out) and use platforms like Vast.ai to rent them out for AI training. When they’re not being used, I’d switch to crypto mining to fill the downtime. I’m thinking 

	•	Hosting: Maybe I’d only get 30% usage on Vast.ai (~$204/month).
	•	Crypto mining: With 85% downtime, I could make more 


Setup cost would be around $7,750 for the GPUs, motherboard, RAM, power supply, and everything else. That means I’d break even in a year or so months… if the math is right.

The things I’m worried about:

	1.	Low hosting demand: Would anyone even rent from me on Vast.ai as a small setup?
	2.	Bandwidth issues: My internet upload maxes out at 32 Mbps. Is that gonna kill my chances?
	3.	Mining volatility: If crypto tanks again, is this even gonna make sense?

I’d keep my day job while doing this and if it works, maybe scale up and bring in investors later. is this realistic or am I just wasting money on something that won’t work?

Anyone here done something similar or have advice? Would love to hear if I’m missing anything "

2. if they say no, go back to my old secondary's sixth form(not a great school, also got bullied there but oh well it's only 1.5years anyway)- ik they will take me because they told me that they would literally let me come back if i asked at the end of year 12/going into year 13(for context i was the only one in my year who got all 8s and 9s so that's why- again, it's not the best school)

  
What should I do? also if anyone has any resources and advice to catch up please lmk i'd really appreciate it.

  
I don't want to resit year 12 and i also would rather not have to teach myself bio a level in a gap year because it would be a waste of my two years at sixth form so those are out of the question. I got a 9 in gcse bio and it was always my best science so i'm confident that i'll be able to catch up but i'm just looking for any advice esp if anyone has been in my position- switching a levels in jan of year 12."
Income and Expense Tracker Spreadsheet Monthly Expense Tracker Personal Finance Sheets Template Excel Spreadsheet Monthly Budget,Apartmentliving,1i9x8h5,2025-01-25 16:14:33,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1i9x8h5/income_and_expense_tracker_spreadsheet_monthly/,Striking-Quantity661,Budgeting & Cost,"Hi everyone! I wanted to share a personal finance tool that’s been super helpful for staying on top of money management. It’s an all-in-one dashboard where you can track income, expenses, savings, and investments in a simple, straightforward way. Whether you’re budgeting, tackling debt, or working towards big financial goals, this dashboard makes it easier to keep everything organized.

# Here’s a quick overview of what it does:

* **Transactions Tab**: Record income and expenses, and it handles the math for you.
* **Monthly & Yearly Dashboards**: See where you stand each month and over the year.
* **Calendar View**: Track daily spending visually.
* **Customizable Categories**: Adjust it to fit your needs.
* **Summary Overview**: Get a big-picture look at your financial health.

It’s been very helpful for many people in reducing the stress of managing finances. If you’re looking for a way to simplify money tracking or just want to get a clearer picture of your finances and understand where your money is being spent, I think this could be really useful.

This year let's make it different! Let's take this opportunity to create something special together.

I am 26M from Hungary. I am pretty much an introvert (INTJ) and kinda a nerd ig, I have degree of Mathematics (i can help with your math homework) and CS, also I work in IT field.

I like to play videogames and ideally you also would be down to play something together. Maybe just some chill co-op game or even just watch me play while we talk, it is a good way to do stuff together in LDR. We can also watch random series if you are into that. My other hobbies are doing/watching sports, I like F1 and football, also i used to fence and table tennis in college. I used to go hiking a lot from my summer house, maybe we could go there together sometime? I also like to learn about different cultures and languages, I speak several at least in a basic level. I have a goofy ahh family dog but I rarely see her since I moved :c

Physically I am 6'3, white, on the skinnier side. I have blonde hair and blue eyes.

Personality wise: as I already said I am an introvert and kinda quiet sometimes. I am smart and reportedly funny sometimes. I am kind, patient, and I would love to listen to you yap about anything, I am supportive and I would always remember small things u told me. So if you like to get showered with attention and feel loved and special I am a very good choice :3. Also I am loyal and VERY honest about things, so if you are the type of person who gets offended easily this wont work. If I have a problem I would let you know, I do not care if it is something you dont want to hear, honesty is always the best option.

So what I am looking for is a female around the age 20-28, preferably from EU, or would consider move to the EU in the future (if everything works out). But lets just talk and we will see, we can worry about distance stuff later. Appearance wise I dont have much preference, I like girls on the skinnier/fit side, but It doesnt matter as long as you look healthy. I would like us to exchange photos early on. I prefer someone with shared interests and hobbies, or at least be open to try stuff together. I want a relationship where we can be ourself and talk about anything openly. Being with someone where you feel safe and dont have to filter youself all the time is the best feeling. And as I said I value honesty, open communication and loyalty. I am looking for something monogamous obviously, it should go without saying but you cant know in this cooked generation. **Make sure you are actually committed for a LDR and wont change your mind. Also be able to meet up within a reasonable time.**

If this sounds interesting send a small intro and maybe a pic of yourself. I would like to move to a different platform as soon as you are comfortable with it, doesnt matter where, just away from Reddit lmao"

At my work there have been a lot of changes to our pto this year. We switched to a use it or lose it but allowing 40 hours of rollover. Now instead of earning 3.07 hours of pto a week (4 weeks a year) I earn 3.07 hours per 40 hours worked. We also get 10 holidays a year that also used to be paid but now only 6 are paid with 4 requiring us to use pto on. And we get one week of sick time the state mandates they give us.

So if your doing the math if I take all my time off through the year that is 7 weeks off that will have no pto build up so a loss of 21.49 pto hours. So my question is would this be considered being punished for taking my pto? If I don't take my pto I lose it if I take my pto I don't get it all plus now forcing us to use 4 days worth for holidays that used to be paid."

Early opinions too, but we've seen a lot of Kurogiri combos and stuff these last few days, and I think we've got a good grasp on him, no? Maybe not in a 3 stack, since a lot of people play solo queue, but still. Balance is a huge issue, and I plan on copy and pasting this stuff to the official discord's feedback. if I'm not being stupid with these changes, and add more changes based off of what you say about characters I was never skilled in (My aim and mechanics feel terrible now, so no way I'm good at Iida or Ibara all of a sudden). Skill sets will have parenthesis with the skillset's name. If I think a special action should be changed, I will put it under both the OG character and the skill set, labeled (Character's name) Special Action.

Izuku Midoriya: Crouched Alpha at lvl 9 deals 115 damage, and previous levels are adjusted accordingly, and 2nd Gamma is received at level 4.  Gamma now properly pulls targets (bug fix)

Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet): Alpha has larger spread and deals 1 less damage per pellet (at lvl 9 he does 100 damage), and a fully charged Beta requires more height.

Katsuki Bakugo: Alpha deals 7 more damage across all levels, and Gamma now properly drags opponents for the final hit

Katsuki Bakugo (Machine Gun): Now only has 1 Gamma, and 3rd Beta charge is gained at lvl 7.

Ochako Uraraka: Gamma now comes out faster. Gamma does full knockdown upon ""releasing"" the Gamma. Decrease Alpha reload speed at all levels by 1 second.

Shoto Todoroki: Alpha hitbox is widened at all levels, and damage is increased by 5 across all levels. Beta is slightly further away. Gamma travels faster.

Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame): Alpha deals 20 less damage across all levels. Now only has 2 Beta charges. 

Tenya Iida: Alpha deals 5 less damage across all levels. Beta deals 20 less damage at lvl 9, and progression is scaled accordingly.

Asui Tsuyu: Alpha now starts with 3 charges, and deals 10 more damage across all levels

Denki Kaminari: Alpha deals 5 less damage across all levels. Beta has stuns on every hit (NOT electrify). Gamma deals 15 less damage across all levels.

Eijiro Kirishima: Alpha now properly carries, even when turning. Beta deals 15 more damage across all levels, and has significantly longer range at lvls 1-3, and slightly longer range at lvls 4-8, and Beta no longer stops at an opponent- Instead, Kirishima has an active hitbox for Beta for the entire duration.

Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive): Alpha travels slower. Bug fix so that Alpha>Beta movement tech no longer works.

Momo Yaoyorozu: Beta comes out faster and now blocks attacks in a semicircle in front of Momo. Attacks behind Momo still hit. Gamma takes less time to place and start firing.

All Might: Alpha deals 11 less damage across all levels.

All Might (Special Action): It now takes 40 seconds to fully recharge, whether from jump or fully depleting the gauge from carrying someone.

Shoto Aizawa: Alpha now properly pulls targets to you (bug fix). 

Tomura Shigaraki: Both Alpha AND Beta now hit slightly above the ground in a similar manner as Overhaul Gamma, in such a way that Hawks flying at ground level, alongside certain moves performed along the ground after jumping (such as Iida's Alpha- it temporarily stops the damage from what I found). 

Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe): Alpha, Beta, and the last hit of Gamma now hit slightly above the ground in a similar manner as Overhaul Gamma and the Strike Shigaraki changes for the same purposes. Alpha now travels faster and knocks down upon 2nd hit. In addition, the direct hit deals 12 more damage, and the indirect hit deals 10 less damage across all levels. The 1st hit of Gamma knocks down faster so that you cannot perform a second Gamma or beta after landing a direct Beta at the same target.

All for One (Special Action): Special Action now has a 5 second cooldown, instead of 20 seconds.

Dabi: HP increased to 400. Alpha travels faster. Beta now deals all damage in a single hit, and does 160 damage at max level, with level one dealing 20 more damage, and the levels inbetween adjusting accordingly. Additionally, you have 1 more charge at levels 1-3.

Dabi (Crazy Torch): HP decreased to 300. Alpha, when not powered by Gamma, charges faster. Beta no longer has tracking, and travels further when not powered by Gamma. Additionally, the final hit of Beta always does a hard knockdown, and the kick, when the grab does not connect, allows for recovery. Finally, the hit registration is now fixed. Gamma has a cooldown similar to Iida's Gamma, and no longer generates flame rings while active. Additionally, upon ending Gamma, it always does the final burst. 

Himiko Toga: Alpha, at levels 1-3, have a cooldown of .75 second per bullet, and at levels 7-9, a cooldown of 0.4 seconds. Beta cooldown increased by 7 seconds. Beta's range for the initial hit is doubled. At max level, the first hit of Beta deals 10 more damage, and the second and third hits now deal 42 more damage, and the following hits deal 50 damage each. (For an explaination, the ""dash"" at the start of Beta comes out in 3 hits. Right now, it deals 10, 33, and 33 damage, respectively. Afterwards, we get the 88 damage per hit. With the changes I made, it deals I think 41 damage more for hitting all hits? However, not hitting it at the start means you deal less damage.) Gamma has better tracking, a cooldown increase of 8 seconds, and deals 7 less damage across all levels per needle. (The following cooldown changes are VERY dependent on the Special Action changes I made)

Himiko Toga (Sting Dance): When using Alpha, there is a .5 second delay instead of the .33(?) delay before you can fire another Alpha, the bullet count is now increased to 10, and the cooldown is increased to 1.75 per bullet. Beta's cooldown is now doubled. Gamma's distance is increased by 1.5 at levels 4-9, alongside the speed of the second part of Gamma, and Gamma now does not gain an additional charge. Additionally, the cooldown for each charge is increased by 3.5 seconds (The following cooldown changes are VERY dependent on the Special Action changes I made)

Himiko Toga (Special Action): Transform now no longer resets your cooldowns. Instead, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma all recharge at the same rate while Transformed. (This effectively requires Toga to use blood effectively for longer periods of time to fully recharge their abilities. Also, Transform effectively has a ""cooldown"" until the next down OR until Gamma recharges- which, for both, is around 12-13 seconds \[per charge\] if I did my math right, meaning she ACTUALLY has to juggle cooldowns.)

Endeavor: Alpha and Beta bug fixes (ofc). Alpha now hits one additional time for each bullet (without changing the duration), and he has 6 bullets at all levels. Beta's first hit deals 40 more damage at level 9, 20 more damage at lvl 1, and all other levels are adjusted accordingly.  Gamma now takes less time to activate.

Endeavor (Special Action): Sustaining Sprint while using special action now costs 75% of the current drain. Using it to jump consumes 35% of the gauge, instead of 50%, and has less startup, and you can't use it if the gauge is under 35%.

Mirio: Increased to 250 HP (Mirio mains before the nerfs- tell me the old combos plz- I'll take it into consideration when posting to the discord)

Nejire Hado: Alpha travel speed is increased. Beta size is decreased, and subsequent hits deal damage every .5 seconds instead of .25 seconds(? Still- the point stands). Additionally, the gauge for Beta goes down faster. 

Overhaul: Alpha deals 5 more damage on the initial hit (so 80 per bullet, as, right now, the first hit is 15, while the other 3 are 20). Gamma deals 30 less damage across all levels, but stuns for twice as long.

Overhaul (Special Action): When healing, instead of fully healing and healing 125 shields while self-healing and fully healing both upon healing an ally, both using up both charges, self-healing heals for 175, prioritizing HP, and uses one charge, and healing an ally heals for 300, prioritizing HP, and uses one charge. (This allows him to be more flexible with his heals but heal for less during a fight most of the time. Also, allows for the second charge to be used to disrupt a combo even if you healed once.)

Twice: Remove Gamma tracking. (From what I know, Twice was fine before they added tracking? Correct me if I'm wrong tho)

Compress: Alpha stun is reduced, and fire rate is SLIGHTLY reduced (Maybe to 1.5 times a second instead of what seems to be 2 times a second?). 

Hawks:  Alpha deals 3 less damage at all levels. The subsequent hits of Beta now deal the same damage as the first hit. The last hit of Melee now causes a full knockdown. 

Itsuka Kendo: Alpha has a tighter spread. Beta insta-break bug fixed (if it wasn't already). Gamma damage increased by 36 damage at lvl 9, and damage for previous levels is adjusted accordingly. 

Mt. Lady: Gamma recharges at 6.5 seconds per bullet at levels 4-6, and at 5 seconds per bullet at levels 7-9. 

Cementoss: Alpha structure is shorter, and the second hit of Alpha deals 20 less damage at all levels. Gamma is thinner at levels 4-9. Beta is now fixed, if they didn't fix the wall bug stuff where it instantly broke sometimes. (People who have fought more Cementoss, and people who play him- tell me if these are bad changes)

Ibara: Alpha finishes faster. Beta now deal their second hit of damage faster, and finishes faster. Gamma hits faster. (I feel like the main reason why she isn't that great compared to the rest of the cast is because of how immobile she is. Hopefully this would help her? I don't play her though. I once again request help from people who main this character.)

Kurogiri: Alpha now properly is perpedicular to the surface it hits, if it hits a wall, floor, or ceiling. Beta damage is reduced by 15 at all levels. Gamma travels faster. (The beta change is mostly because triple Beta into Alpha is a thing, and while I think it's good that they have it, it does need toned down a LITTLE so that most the cast isn't screwed over by it and being flesh.)

Present Mic: Beta, when held down, now deals 5 less damage per hit. Gamma now has 2 charges instead of 3, and deals 20 less damage at all levels. Additionally, the multipliers for 1 and 2 teammates down or dead is now 1.25 and 1.5, respectively. (He should still be a proper strike character with this, but he's definitely overtuned, even if not as overtuned as other characters)

Present Mic (Special Action): Has 2 charges instead of 3.

If you're wondering, the character I changed the MOST was likely both Togas. In third place, it's Strike Dabi thanks to all the Beta and Gamma changes lol. In fairness though, I overhauled how Toga's Transform worked, and made sure to change a bunch of cooldowns, alongside the other changes I made.  Anyway, that's quite literally EVERY character, except for Denki (Lightning), which hasn't released yet, so if these changes are trash, tell me which ones! I'll start copying the list of changes at 3 PM CST to the official discord TOMORROW, so 23 hours and 50 minutes from this post going live (it took me 3 hours to type this all out, thanks to me having to test/find some stuff and find proper damage numbers, as the database only displays 1 of several damage numbers for multi-hit moves).

Confused About Loan Repayment Estimates: $38k in Loans Somehow Becomes $100k?,ApplyingToCollege,1i9x4id,2025-01-25 16:09:39,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1i9x4id/confused_about_loan_repayment_estimates_38k_in/,EpixOofer,Financial Aid/Scholarships,"Hi everyone, I’m a senior from NY, and UNC Charlotte is my target school. I’ve been going through the financial aid details, and something seems off. As an out-of-state student, my yearly cost after accounting for federal work-study, Pell Grant, SEOG, and two federal loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) comes out to around $18,143.

The federal loans I’d take out each year total $9,500 ($3,500 subsidized and $6,000 unsubsidized), which means after four years, I’d have borrowed about $38,000. The subsidized loan doesn’t accrue interest while I’m in school, and the unsubsidized loan has a 6.53% interest rate.

I used UNC Charlotte's loan calculator to estimate repayment, but it showed a total repayment amount of over $100,000 if I pay $900/month for 10 years, which doesn’t make sense to me. If I’m paying $900/month, I’d expect to pay off the loans in about 4 years, not 10, and definitely not end up paying $100k.

Is the calculator just assuming I’ll stick to a 10-year plan and pay $900/month for 10 years, even if I’m paying way more than the minimum? It would be expected to be paid off in 4 years on a 900/month payment.

I've already asked this question on a math subreddit and they said it doesn't add up as to how it would come off at over 100k.

Can anyone help me figure out what’s going on? Is the calculator wrong? That's the main assumption I'm going off currently as well as other's I've talked to.

Thank you!"

I flunked Secondary School (I'm Irish for reference) and had to take a version of the math course that bars me from any college opportunities due to my dyscalculia. My only escape from my father is a week trip to my best friend in America twice a year. I have nothing and can only really take solace in being such a perfect abuse victim that it's enabled my much more capable sister to get very close to escaping with her fiance. 

I've done everything I can. I work a dead end part time job that pays like shit because it's all I can get. My best friend convinced me to start taking writing commissions and they're decent but extremely inconsistent money. I started HRT in July of last year and I'm starting to feel like I finally belong in my own skin. Like my body is mine. But every aspect of me other than some growing breasts and more feminine looks is male. I can never change my name. I can never wear female clothing. I can't voice train as the only person at home in this very small apartment more than me is my abuser, so even my best friend still occasionally and accidentally calls me ""he"" in voice calls and the rare times we're in person (she's trans mtf too so don't give her shit for it thank you). I can't escape and I can't be me.

My rent is free beyond buying my Dad cigarettes, half the groceries and paying the internet bill. While he's guaranteed to move there with me, I do maybe one day have social housing to bleed me dry in a place I hate until I die.   
  
I'm scared what I should be focusing on is that the abuse is the cost of surviving. That I can't be a woman because I can only survive here. I have no life skills, no way to get any real qualifications and nowhere to go. If I run out on my own I'll either die or end up back with an even angrier version of my abuser.

It all feels hopeless and I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just not allowed to be happy. I'm not allowed the life I want.

Maybe I have to stop transitioning and accept that I can't be me."

Also, I myself am not a dozenalist, but I thought it'd be nice to share.

I have figured out how to handle 5 and 7 in dozenal with nearly the same ease as those numbers in seximal. This could chip away quite significantly at the case for seximal, leaving little else but long numbers and an inability to handle Bs and 11s.

This method relies on a few things.

* Knowing that A and 12 are just 2 off from 10
* Knowing that 5 and 7 are factors of A and 12
* Understanding magic sequences better than the guys who did the video ""The Best Way to Count""
* Balanced magic sequences

So first things first, to get the magic sequence for a number, you start with 1, then at each step, you multiply 10 and then keep subtracting 10 until you get less than 10. For the balanced version, you keep subtracting until you get to just less than or equal to a half the number.

The magic sequence can be used to test divisibility of a dividend by that number, simply by multiplying each successive, starting from the units then leftward digit by the corresponding term in the sequence to see if the result is also divisible by the target number.

I'll give an example

For 2, the sequence starts 1. Then you simply multiply to get 10, which is equivalent to 0 mod 2, so from then on, we have 0. The sequence is therefore simply 1 (and infinite 0s) To test a random number like 1234, we have 4\*1+3\*0+2\*0+1\*0=4, which is divisible by 2, therefore so is the whole thing. That seemed silly and obvious, so we'll go onto a different kind of case as a next example.

For B, the sequence starts at 1, then we multiply by 10 to get 10, which is 1 more than B. Therefore the sequence is a recurring 1. You therefore simply add the digits. This too is an obvious case.

For A, things get interesting, We know A is 2 less than 10, so the first 2 terms are 1 and 2. There is a shortcut here, in that because 10 is equivalent to 2 mod A, we only need to double, rather than multiply by 10. This means we effectively are effectively doing the magic sequence in binary. Knowing this, we can add more terms, 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2... Clearly once we reach 2 it's recurring. This also gives an easy test for 2 digit numbers, so 26 leads to 2\*4+6=A, so we verified without too much difficulty that 26 is divisible by 10.

Now onto 5, 5 is half of A, meaning that the first term, must be the same because you can fit an extra 5 into 10 and still have 2 leftover. This means the terms are 1, 2, 4, 3, 1...

So how do we do the same for 12, and 7? Well, their second terms are 10, which doesn't seem to help, however, by using balanced modular arithmetic, we can rewrite as -2. From this we can simply do 1, -2, 4, 6, 2, -4, -6, -2... Likewise, 7 would be 1, -2, -3, -1. -2, -3, 1... We can also simplify for 5 and A to get 1, 2, -1, -2, 1 and 1, 2, 4, -2, -4, 2...

With these facts you should be able to quickly tell if any number is divisible by 5 or 7. You can even figure out the radix expansion. Take the sequence for 5; 1, 2, 4, 3. Simply ask how many times does 5 fit into 10 times the amount. the answers are 2, 4, 9, 7.

Hopefully this helps you find more ease in dozenal maths. If there's anything I didn't explain well, please let me know."
The Flying Bank Robber,dbcooper,1i9x2is,2025-01-25 16:07:05,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dbcooper/comments/1i9x2is/the_flying_bank_robber/,Kamkisky,,"I'll begin by saying I expect this guy to have been checked out early after the skyjacking. I'm assuming he is in the 302s (ruled out), but I don't know that since I don't have a searchable database of 302s.

With those caveats, I present to the community a man with the following resume:

\- Lifelong criminal

\- Bank Robber over decades

\- Exact height/weight/eye color...with ""medium skin tone"" per FBI

\- 41.5 years old at time

\- From Ohio (accent)

\- Flight trained in Washington state

\- Liked to dress ""Ivy League""

\- ""Studious and quiet spoken""

\- FBI Ten Most Wanted (briefly)

\- Last prisoner to leave Alcatraz

\- In Alcatraz, he told a newsman, he studied things like ""plane trigonometry, differential calculus and advance engineering math""

\- Showed no remorse for crimes

\- Escaped prison

\- Had 35 aliases / stole 29 cars / stole 3 planes (they know about, over a short period...like 1.5 yrs)

\- Brazen, would use planes in his bank robberies and for fun

\- Flew to Mexico

\- Military experience\* (Maybe on this one)

\- Paroled in 1970 (or 71..conflicting sources)

\- Appears again in 1976 assisting bank robbers and escaping via commercial flight

\- Had lived in town 4 years prior to 1976 with second wife as a ""friendly, unassuming TV repairman""

\- Learned TV repair in prison (prior to 71 release) \*Tie particles?

\- Once crashed a plane on purpose to escape

\- Once got caught because he crashed a plane

\- ""The Flying Bank Robber"" was literally his nickname, I didn't make it up.

\- Was a ""wig-wearing daredevil"" since the 1950s \* I know this one will draw attention from the community so take a look at him (early 1971 the first link) and read some more:

I bought the 2500 gold mini set first. Then under it  I saw three  mini-mini sets for 1200 gold each. It was a dumb mistake not looking at what cards I get from the 2500 gold mini set so I thought I would  need to purchase all the other 3 ones for 1200 to  get all the cards. I bought the Zerg and Protoss ones for 1200 and realized its the cards I already own from the 2500 gold mini set. Needless to say blizzard support wont refund anything that is purchased  with ingame currency so that didn't work. I just dont understand why they would code it like that. They should come up as owned already not be able to be purchased the second time. But I guess thats too much for blizzard shop coders to ask for. Anyway I could  care less about 2400 gold less but be careful ( or dont) if you need extra dust. If someone wants to do the math how much dust you get from  each of the 1200 mini sets because they do show up in my collection as extras. So at least I can disenchant them for dust (which I dont really need at this point ) but yea maybe its worth it for you if you are in need of extra dust which you might not get from buying 12 packs. So yea exploit early, exploit often as they say. "

Should I just drop the class or keep trying and hope it makes sense eventually? Hoping for some perspective from people who are good at math. "

I do the plumbing for new construction homes. Imo, it’s not the hardest job but it’s somewhat monotonous.  Dealing with the cold and heat is probably the hardest part of the job.  Hours worked are completely random depending on the work for the day.  It could be a 3-4 hour day just as easy as it could be daylight to dark.  Lunch would be your responsibility.  We don’t really take breaks. 

Skills I’m looking for would be the ability to read a level and tape measure. Be legal to work to the USA.  Also basic fractional math. And the biggest thing, a willingness to work. 

I’m able to pay hourly(20-30$) or a percentage of work done(20-30%) I’d prefer paying a percentage as I get paid for what I do and your salary comes from my salary and a percentage helps instill the “more work you do the more you make” mentality. Which one works out better totally depends on the day. Insurance is also available, although I think enrollment only happens in the fall. Would have to check on that.  All tools provided unless you want a specific brand or whatever.  I for sure won’t stop you from buying your own tools.  

If there’s something you have questions about or you’re interested in a job, hit the pm’s.  I’m sure there’s something I’ve missed.

Disclaimer: this is all according to banzuke math. There will be discrepancies based on the mismatching number of potential demotees and promotees coupled with the existence of Maegashira 18 (which is likely to exist but may not) and Terunofuji’s retirement. We will know nothing concrete until after day 15, and nothing as fact until the next banzuke is released. THIS IS JUST FOR FUN AND SPECULATION

Makuuchi demotions: hokutofuji, Roga, kitanowaka, kotoshoho, tokihayate, Kagayaki, tamashoho

Kagayaki and tamashoho join the demotion group with losses on day 14. We will have a conundrum in our hands as I will explain later.

Sadanoumi punches his return ticket to the top division with a win on day 14. He and Ryuden had a taste of juryo for the first time in a while and decided their palate was more accustomed to the makuuchi delicacies.

With a loss on day 14, shirokuma is now eliminated from the promotion picture…barring lots of shenanigans

With 1 win: Kayo, Asakoryu

Because so far 7 makuuchi rikishi deserve mathematic demotion and only 6 juryo rikishi have a substantial chance at promotion, I will put a list at the end of this post of what I think priority will look like for the makuuchi rikishi who will be spared despite their demotable records.

JURYO DEMOTIONS: Bushozan, daishoho, Shimazuumi, daiamami

With a loss on day 14, daiamami is now part of the demotables.

With 1 loss: Daiseizan, Shimanoumi, Kiryuko, hatsuyama

MAKUSHITA PROMOTIONS: wakanosho, kazekeno, hitoshi, kusano

Hitoshi dispelled any doubts of his promotion with a win on day 14. Miyagi with a 4-3 at Ms 4 is a borderline case. We will see.

With 1 win: otsuji

MAKUUCHI PRIORITY LIST: this is based on who has the most wins at the tier ranks based on the possible outcomes after day 15

Tokihayate 7-8
Kotoshoho 5-10
Mitakeumi 2-13
Tamashoho 6-9
Kagayaki 6-9
Shirokuma 9-6
Asakoryu 8-7
Tokihayate 6-9
Tamashoho 5-10

If all it takes to beat OpenAI is a maximum of $55million, the industry is becoming commoditized way faster than previously expected.

US-based AI companies alone will have to generate about $600 billion a year in revenue to pay for their AI hardware, according to Sequoia. 

The capex and R&D will likely be accepted to remain competitive given the risks of not being involved in the space, however it is getting harder by the day to envision a profitable venture in the field.

in the best math club in Russia. In this club I solve the hardest problems

Member , English club in Moscow State Institute of International
Relations
I attend the English club at the best university in international relations
in Russia, I got in the strongest group based on exam results.

Member, Math and Physics in Moscow Institute of Physics and
Technology (Summer camp)
These subjects are interesting for me because both of them help people
understand the world around us. It also gave dorm life experience 

Member, Physics in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
I prepare for my national Olympiad in group of students with highly
qualified professor. I also wanted to spend time with people with same
interests.

Researcher, Research
I do research about different topics and bring them into school and
presented them in front of my school.

Coach, Figure skating coach
I tried myself as a coach, I practiced skating skills with kids. I did it for
money, I spent on my and my sister's school cloth and supplies.

Member, Figure skating
I have the first sports category, could do all triple jumps. I also got 16th
place in Russian national junior competition

Teacher, I replaced my math teacher for a day (it was absolutely legal,
and for free)
It was a really cool experience to spend time as teacher and even taught
your own classmates. It also helped me to figure out how hard teaching
is.


Additional information:

1. I don't submit English test in my country all international cards are blocked, so I can't pay for
exam.

2. In Russia students usually spend only 11 years at school and high school is 10th and 11th
grades. 

3. My school do not provide class rank, but me and classmates calculated it ourselves in 9th and
10th. In 9th grade I got the 5th place in class and in the 10th grade I got the first.

4. When I listed my courses, I named some of them advanced because teachers gave me tests
and exams which were harder than my classmates solved (I asked for it because my school don't
provide any advanced/honors courses or AP/IB class)

5. My sister homeschooled throughout last years in elementary school before 2022 because of
propaganda at school. I had been teaching her, and didn't have enough time for my homework and
a drop in my grades in secondary school.

2024 NW + Investments Review!,financialindependence,1i9wm3t,2025-01-25 15:47:14,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i9wm3t/2024_nw_investments_review/,PlusSpecialist8480,,"Long-time lurker on FI and finally bit the bullet on contributing to the conversation! Wanted to share where I'm at after doing my EOY 2024 review as my last paychecks come in (bonus just hit my bank account); any advice on asset allocation/short-term goals are very much appreciated! The goal is to make bi-annual update posts like this one as a financial self-review and to contribute to the community I've learned so much from! TIA all

**The Basics**: mid 20s, VHCOL, 135 base, 2024 bonus came in at 80 (got a raise to 145 base for 2025). Single with no large assets (home, car, etc.) so figured I will pummel in as much money into liquid investments before responsibilities start compounding.

**Goals**: 

* Long-term would like to FIRE in the range of 40-45
* Medium-term I'm focused on getting my income as high and stable as possible and save up for a down payment to buy a primary residence in the next 5-7 years.
* Short term will have to anticipate a job switch this year, where I'm not convinced I will be able to replicate my TC, so aim to have about 6mo of short-term cash

2025 financial goals:

* 200k in retirement accounts (401k - pretax and MBDR, backdoor Roth)
* 210k in taxable brokerage
* 25k saved/invested earmarked for house down payment
* Overall NW of \~440k including cash/emergency fund by EOY 2025

**Current Stats (Jan 2025)**: 

* 157k in taxable brokerage, 95% VTI
* 90k in 401k (mostly pre-tax with \~15k MBDR, includes a vested 12.5% match on each $ I contribute for pre-tax and will hit a vesting cliff later in the year that brings up my vested match to 25%), 100% in VTI or mutual fund equivalents
* 43k in Roth IRA (have been contributing backdoor the last few years and just maxed out my 2025 contribution!), 100% in VTI
* 25k in MMF as an emergency fund (SGOV for favorable state tax treatment)
* 15k in future down payment

**Questions:**

* I am not convinced on the math of renting vs. buying especially in VHCOL when I'm most likely going to retire in a MCOL/HCOL - does it make sense to invest my down payment in the meantime in something like VTI/SGOV 80/20 and slowly move into 100% SGOV as I get closer to buying a place? At what time horizon does the math of investing down payment money make sense vs. short term bonds/HYSA?
* I have not been doing tax-loss harvesting - most of my investments are in VTI which has netted positive, when/does it make sense to do tax-loss harvesting?
* I've been living off my base and intend to save the entirety of my bonus. Given my lumpy one-time bonus payments, would it make sense to pummel first few paychecks to 401k to let an early match (my employer does this) grow over the year and float some expenses using my bonus, or dump the bonus into my brokerage?"
Post day 14 promotion and demotion speculation,Sumo,1i9wko5,2025-01-25 15:45:33,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sumo/comments/1i9wko5/post_day_14_promotion_and_demotion_speculation/,Careful-Programmer10,,"What are the promotions and demotions looking like after day 14?

Disclaimer: this is all according to banzuke math. There will be discrepancies based on the mismatching number of potential demotees and promotees coupled with the existence of Maegashira 18 (which is likely to exist but may not) and Terunofuji’s retirement. We will know nothing concrete until after day 15, and nothing as fact until the next banzuke is released. THIS IS JUST FOR FUN AND SPECULATION

Makuuchi demotions: hokutofuji, Roga, kitanowaka, kotoshoho, tokihayate, Kagayaki, tamashoho

Kagayaki and tamashoho join the demotion group with losses on day 14. We will have a conundrum in our hands as I will explain later. 

With 1 more loss: mitakeumi

JURYO PROMOTIONS: shishi, Aonishiki, Ryuden, sadanoumi

Sadanoumi punches his return ticket to the top division with a win on day 14. He and Ryuden had a taste of juryo for the first time in a while and decided their palate was more accustomed to the makuuchi delicacies. 

With a loss on day 14, shirokuma is now eliminated from the promotion picture…barring lots of shenanigans

With 1 win: Kayo, Asakoryu

Because so far 7 makuuchi rikishi deserve mathematic demotion and only 6 juryo rikishi have a substantial chance at promotion, I will put a list at the end of this post of what I think priority will look like for the makuuchi rikishi who will be spared despite their demotable records. 

JURYO DEMOTIONS: Bushozan, daishoho, Shimazuumi, daiamami

With a loss on day 14, daiamami is now part of the demotables. 

With 1 loss: Daiseizan, Shimanoumi, Kiryuko, hatsuyama

MAKUSHITA PROMOTIONS: wakanosho, kazekeno, hitoshi, kusano

Hitoshi dispelled any doubts of his promotion with a win on day 14. Miyagi with a 4-3 at Ms 4 is a borderline case. We will see. 

With 1 win: otsuji

MAKUUCHI PRIORITY LIST: this is based on who has the most wins at the tier ranks based on the possible outcomes after day 15

1. Tokihayate 7-8

2. Kotoshoho 5-10

3. Mitakeumi 2-13

4. Tamashoho 6-9

5. Kagayaki 6-9

6. Shirokuma 9-6

7. Asakoryu 8-7

8. Tokihayate 6-9

9. Tamashoho 5-10

10. Kotoshoho 4-11

11. Kagayaki 5-10

12. Shirokuma 8-7

A very long winded way of doing this, but it was more to flesh out my own thought. 

Let me know what you guys think.

Windows 11 bug: Deleted image keeps returning as Wallpaper that I never set up,WindowsHelp,1i9wjfd,2025-01-25 15:44:00,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/1i9wjfd/windows_11_bug_deleted_image_keeps_returning_as/,JessPanter,Windows 11,"I’m experiencing a strange glitch on Windows 11. I went to my files to delete some images and videos I didn’t need anymore. After I finished and closed the file manager, an image I deleted suddenly appeared as my wallpaper, even though I never set it as my wallpaper before.



At first, when I hovered my mouse over the apps on my home screen, the background behind those apps turned black. Even after moving my mouse away, the black box behind the apps stayed. I decided to restart my computer.



After restarting, the wallpaper changed to a completely black screen. However, when I hovered my mouse over the apps again, parts of the deleted image started appearing behind the apps, while the rest of the screen stayed black.



When I try to change my wallpaper to a solid color, it works the first time. But when I pick a second color, it switches back to that same deleted image instead of applying the color. Then, when I pick another color after that, it shows the solid color again. This keeps repeating every second time I choose a new color.



Does anyone know what’s causing this or how to fix it?

I have a maximum possible weighted GPA of 4.5 right now in my school because I have never gotten below an A every year so far (not a single A-, and my school doesn't do A+'s for some reason), and this will only increase by the end of this year most likely since I ended semester one with all A's and I am taking 3 APs: Lang, Spanish and Physics 1. I have taken only the highest possible classes for each subject I could've throughout all my high school years so fat (except for math, which there is an enriched class for that I felt was probably too much for me though I will never be able to know since I never took it). Case in point, I am doing successful in school right now, but I'm not a genius.

The AP classes I am considering for next year are: Comp. Science A, Physics C: Electromagnetism, either Calculus AB or BC and maybe either Psyche or Econ. I do not want to be an engineer.

I am looking to my future at the moment and thinking about my college career. I am super super into the sciences, especially Comp. Sci, Physics and pharmaceutical. The schools I am looking at right now have a program for a combined major in both Physics and Computer science, which would basically be my dream (pharma could be a minor for me). However, as I am looking at the required courses for this program, I noticed that for most schools, only 2/7 of them would even be applicable for these majors: Calculus and Lang. That is sort of a major blow to me: I am not from a necassarily financially-blessed family, and it has always been the plan to use my AP credits to be able to graduate earlier and save both money/time and pursue a career or grad school faster. Even past that, it is also just sort of pretty disappointing that I wouldn't be able to use these credits for much, which sort of just makes me feel like there's no reason to take these AP courses.

Yes, I know they help me build a solid foundation for learning and the subjects I will experience in college. I understand they're challenging. But extra college credit is not something thats super easy to just say ""eh, whatever, its fine they're not gonna accept 5/7's of my work"". So I'm sort of at an impasse. Obviously I shouldn't already be deciding my major but its hard to ignore how good of a program this Comp. Sci and Physics one would be for me. 

Main idea: I just don't know if its worth it to take AP Comp. Science and AP Physics C: electromagnetism (I would've taken AP Physics 2, as that course seems much more interesting to me, but my school doesn't offer it unfortunately) if the AP credits won't even matter. I also don't know whether I should take AB or BC calc: I'm good at math, but I do not know HOW good I am, or rather how hard AB vs. BC is: BC would get me more credits however, if I were to take it instead of AB. I know that a lot of people consider precalculus to be harder than calculus, and I have an A in precalculus right now so I just don't really know what to do. I would really appreciate some advice, thank you."

Now feeling lost in life because I don’t want to do and MD or PhD, but there are few lucrative and ethical careers in science that are open to those without these degrees. My strengths have always been in reading and writing and the further I go into science the less I want to do it. 

I’m coping with the fact that I am not going to achieve the level of financial or professional success/esteem as my dad. I feel awful knowing I have no excuses— finances and family support will never be a concern for me. My bf who comes from a middle class family works 2 jobs to pay rent and is applying for PhD programs in bioengineering. I feel lazy and privileged  in comparison, knowing that there are millions of people out there who would kill to be in my position and utilize it to the highest extent. I’m considering law school now but even then I know to get into patent law etc and have a “non evil” career, I should get a PhD or an MD, or go into engineering and CS, but I am so deeply not a math/computers person.

He is learning to read, it was a rough start but is now confident and progressing daily.  He is also very good at math.  The issue is he has more days than not where concentrating is impossible.  It'll take 40 minutes to do a 15 minute lesson.  He is very fidgety, I have him stand and move his body or build while we are doing oral lessons and keep the use down portions very short.  He's currently enrolled in a basketball skills grogram and often sits on his ball, looking around, skipping his turn, picking his nose and just not caring.  He has no drive to do absolutely anything besides ""fixing or building"" things.  He has always been obsessed with machines and was a delayed talker.  He acts perfectly well with his peers, although does struggle to make eye contact.  I believe this is a habit, he did often make eye contact as an infant and toddler.  He is compassionate and caring for others and really internalizes peoples emotions around him.

 That´s why I chose to post this here, bc there may be some interested ppl with more tips/knowledge to help. I´d appreciate any kind of answer regarding my question. Thanks in advance

Contradictory diagnoses - part 2 - childhood,AutismTranslated,1i9w7vy,2025-01-25 15:29:40,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1i9w7vy/contradictory_diagnoses_part_2_childhood/,CovertBeacon,,"Hello all,

This is a part 2 for my previous post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1i24gyz/contradictory\_diagnoses\_need\_help\_for\_next\_steps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1i24gyz/contradictory_diagnoses_need_help_for_next_steps/)

I think this deserves a brand new post because a lot of things happened in my mind since my last post. My thoughts have been a bit eye-opening and I would like to ask once again for your point of view.

Summary of last post:

>I received 2 contradictory diagnoses and I am now a bit lost. The assessment that discards autism does so because of a lack of symptom/evidence of autism in my childhood.

The thing is, I actually do have multiple elements from my childhood that I included in the assessment. And now I have a feeling that maybe I discarded these symptoms too much during the assessment. I remember mentioning all of them, but I would need to add stuff like ""but that was not that bad"" / ""not more than average"" / ""like everybody else"" because I was scared of making them look worse than they were (oh, the good old imposter syndrome). Because let's be honest, they are all mild symptoms, and I never really ""suffered"" from them.

**Here are stuff that I know about my childhood** (either from my parents or from my memories):

* I was **very quiet at school**, keeping everything for myself. When back at home, I would need to “decompress” with bursts of energy: jumping everywhere, running into walls, etc. An elementary school teacher one told my mom ""I did not hear the sound of his voice the whole day"".
* My parents told me I had “**hand tics**” when I was a child. My parents describe them as ""quite often, and quite for a long time"". Maybe from age 4 to 8. And then it stopped.
* Apparently I didn't like when pieces of paper blew away from the wind, it unsettled me.
* Need for “**sensorial geometry**”: let’s say I hit the table with my left hand by mistake, I needed to hit it back with my right hand to ensure “sensorial geometry” in my body. It’s something I still do a little bit as an adult.
* I was also **very strict with time and hours**, and about cleanliness (of my bedroom for example). All of that disappeared as an adult.
* I **learnt to read at an earlier age than average**. And I spent A LOT of time reading during all my childhood and teenagerhood. I loved it.
* As a young kid I had a **fascination for dolphins** (not anymore).
* During most of my late-elementary and middle school, I would **bite my finger tips** (to blood).
* I was sometimes **called ""weird""** (especially my humor) or **""alien""** (because of my facilities at school especially in math class), but never in a bad way.
* I always **preferred alone activities** (reading, piano, swimming, athletics sports, etc.). Exception for theatre classes that I did for a while. But for example I did 3 years of soccer practice (I asked for it), but I remember that the only reason was because it was popular. I wanted to do like everybody and to be a cool kid.



**Why I maybe discarded all of that during my assessment:**

My father was a medical staff and worked all his life as a **psychiatry nurse**. First with adults, and then with children in a day care for the second part of his career.

When I had talks with my parents about all these symptoms I'm describing here, they would often repeat to me that it was **""not worrying"" and ""normal""**. So of course I used the same language during the assessment. The point of my dad was that in his experience, my symptoms were much, much ""milder"" / ""lighter"" than what he experiences with autistic kids at work, so it was at a **""normal"" level** for him, and definitely not potential signs of autism. He gave me examples of kids ""bursting into tears and anger"" when they would ""undo"" a puzzle. Or other kids really struggling with eye contact or motor skills. So now I realize my dad maybe had some kind of **cognitive bias** because of his work. Obviously, the kids he was working with in day care had much more ""severe"" symptoms than somebody with level 1 autism that does not need that much support of accommodation. And maybe because of that, I (consciously or not) decided to not insist too much on all of these traits.

Also, even as a kid I never had issues with eye contact or making friends. I always had a quite big and close group of friends. I was never bullied, in fact I was quite popular, seen as a funny guy (I think), I was invited at birthday parties, and I never had issues joining social activities. Same for dating, later in life. I do not recognize myself at all in the ""social difficulties"" part of the DSM-5 criteria. So I have to say that it makes me easily discard the other ""symptoms"" as well.



Look, I am not really expecting anything from this post. Just the act of posting it forces me to write my thought down and it's already helping. Kind of a written psychotherapy lol.

But still... do you think I self-sabotaged by own assessment? :D"

I’m currently in my third year of architecture studies in the ENSA Paris-Est, and I’m planning to apply for a master’s program in architecture at EPFL. I know the school is renowned for its scientific education.

At my current school, we have math and physics courses, but they’re not very advanced. I’m highly motivated, but I’m genuinely worried that the scientific level at EPFL might be extremely high compared to what I’ve been taught so far.

For those pursuing a master’s degree there, could you let me know if you really need to already be very good in science, or if the courses are manageable even for students with an average level, as long as they are dedicated and attentive in class?

Thank you for your answers"

I don’t know how much fuel I need, let alone the size of the tank and the other math involved.  I just need the tank filled and I’ll pay that total dollar amount…like every other gas station in the civilized world.

The only alternative to typing an unknown dollar amount was going inside, being told to type $100.00 at the pump, then pump, then go back inside to pay.  (And she was very rude.)

It’s like whoever designed this system has never been to Europe, the US, Canada, etc.  This gas station’s system is completely nonsensical.  It’s why no other gas station I’ve ever encountered does it this way…because it’s stupid.  And this is a new, modern gas station in a safe place where *many* rental cars are to be expected.

So what’s the deal here?  Is this normal?  Or did I find the most incompetent gas station in the Cayman Islands?

I work in social media—low pay, no stability, and no future I’m excited about. I have a math degree from a top 15 school and have been exploring career options like actuarial science or tech, but medicine stands out for its financial stability. I tried self-teaching code, but it fizzled out.

I’d be starting from scratch—no prerequisites, no clinical experience, and no passion for medicine. My *only* motivation is the job security, salary, and respect. I never had an inkling to pursue this field when I was in college, I wanted to go into finance but found it boring. But I want to buy a house soon and I just envy the salary and how 'recession proof' medicine is. The clear, defined path (postbac, MCAT, med school) is appealing, and I’m okay with $300k of debt if it means a guaranteed $200k+ salary in 10 years.

Is it realistic to start this late for financial reasons alone? Again, I am not particularly passionate about medicine at all. I just want honest advice if pursuing this for the salary is smart or stupid. Will I regret pursuing a career I’m not passionate about? I’d love honest, no-BS advice, especially from anyone who started later in life. Be blunt, roast me, etc. I don't want to waste the rest of my life"

Although I remember in Middle School I was teased about the name asking if my mom ""named me after the movie"" because kids are fucking stupid and can't math apparently... Even now I work for a theme park and people see my name and occasionally will ask if it's related to the movie, but I'm much older than that. 

I'm sad to say that as much as I did enjoy the film. (And even City of Angels) Growing up with the name Draven turned me off of the movie a lot so I never properly gave it appreciation. I've only met a couple other people with my name and they were both children so I assume they were named after the Crow, but my question is if anyone here is named Draven or named their kid Draven, or any influence because of the film. 

EDIT: I should say that I wasn't named after the movie obviously, but I was named ""Raven"" as my mother was native American, but my father was of Scottish descent and wanted it to be ""Daniel"" so kinda met in the middle with Draven as a unique combination of the two. 
Ironically growing up a crow or Raven has always been part of my life. There was a story when I was born I was visited by a raven, throughout my life there was always Crow around so my mother said it was my spirit animal. And now as an adult I am a Norse Pagan and also relate to the Ravens of Odin. "

AIO for feeling off about not being invited to my boyfriend’s birthday lunch with his mom,AmIOverreacting,1i9vlto,2025-01-25 15:02:29,3,0.8,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i9vlto/aio_for_feeling_off_about_not_being_invited_to_my/,ubi_amor_ibi_dolor,👨‍👩‍👧‍👦family/in-laws,"TLDR: My adult boyfriend’s mom is having a birthday lunch for him and I’m not invited. Meanwhile, my infant son is attending and we also had a family lunch the week prior to celebrate the birthday. Is this weird? AIO because I feel some type of way (bummed? I can’t explain the feeling) for being excluded? 

For some context to lead up to the question here: My (30 f) bf (39 m) and I have been dating for a year and a half. We have a child together who is just a few months old (yes, your math is correct. We got pregnant early into the relationship). He is the youngest of 3. No, he is NOT a “mama’s boy” and she does not seem to be a “boy mom.” Because he had been single for awhile and entering his late 30’s, his mom did not think he would have a child. I entered the picture and surprise! She and his sister were elated. My relationship with my boyfriend’s mother is good. She seems to like me. 

Every year his mom has a dinner with each of her children on their birthday. When I first started dating my boyfriend I didn’t think much about not being included. His birthday was just a few months into our relationship and considering he had been single for several years prior it was maybe more of a habit not think to include me. Again, at the time I didn’t think much about it. If anything I thought, “oh that’s sweet of him to have a nice relationship with his mom.” 

This year she said she wanted to have a family lunch to celebrate all the birthdays of that month - hers, her husband’s and my boyfriend’s. I was included in this lunch - We packed up our baby and drove an hour to come to them and they were 20+ minutes late. However, no one really talked to me much so I spent the whole lunch talking to his 10 year old niece. I figured “well, I’m sitting at the end of the table so maybe it’s the seating that doesn’t make it very easy for the rest to talk to me.” His mother did talk to me at the very end briefly so I could take her picture with my boyfriend and my son.

Now this is where I’m not sure if I’m overreacting (and honestly not sure of how to describe my feelings about it in general) - she then arranged for ANOTHER birthday lunch for the following Saturday (yay- another disrupted Saturday) for just her and my boyfriend. I’m not invited. 

The night before I called a friend of mine to ask her opinion about it since my mom had mentioned that she thought it was weird. My friend agreed and told me that it seems like his family is only nice to me to keep access open to my son. She then was like “well, you can have your boyfriend take the baby with him so you can have some baby free time or another thought is to not allow your child to go where you are not invited to go.” It had been a very challenging Friday (I work full time from home AND watch the baby alone for 12 hours due to our work schedules and living arrangement) - the baby wasn’t eating or napping much etc etc. So I asked my boyfriend if he is taking our son and he said he would if I was ok with it. I decided it was since I did need a bit of a break (although I usually do get a break when I’m done with work and on the weekends since my boyfriend takes over care). Although, I was reluctant since these outings are often made without any consideration that we have an infant who has a feeding and napping schedule. 

I did have a conversation about if she eats alone with his siblings on their birthday and if their spouses and children are ever invited/attend. He said it’s usually just them and this individual lunch came about since it was hard to arrange for all family members to be in attendance at the same time. I then followed up with why there was another lunch if the family lunch was already celebrating the birthdays and everyone was there? He said he doesn’t know. 

Today, we spent the morning watching a show and then he went to get dressed to have lunch with his mom. He then played with the baby and got him dressed. His mom called that she was going to be 30+ minutes late. She was going to meet him at the house and then they would ride together to the restaurant. I decided I would just go take a shower since I started to feel awkward about the whole thing. Like, should I have just been sitting on the couch in my pajamas (since I live here!) and waving them goodbye as I sit alone?? His mother arrived when I was in the shower and my boyfriend let me know they were leaving. 

Now I’m not sure how I feel about being excluded. I didn’t think I would be upset but I’m not really looking forward to ordering food and eating lunch by myself especially given our schedules don’t even allow for us to have lunch or dinner together during the week. I think maybe I feel like I’m “just the girlfriend,” and almost like just the “vessel” that carried her grandchild and made her beloved son a father. I also don’t know if this is totally a normal thing to do. I was raised by a single mother who is maternal but in a different way other than the typical motherly image and I’m an only child (I bring this up because maybe I have a different example of “family” than he does). I have a son now so is this normal mother son behavior? Am I going to want a lunch with just him? 

Either way I’m not sure how to describe how I feel but part of me doesn’t want to be at the house just eating my door dash alone while waiting for their return but I feel too bummed to drive anywhere. My feelings just really started as the day went on so I didn’t have time to discuss it with my boyfriend but also I just don’t even know how or what I would say since I don’t know if this is normal, I can’t pinpoint words to describe what I feel and I am a few months postpartum so maybe I’m being hormonal?

 ""Nyeh...Kokichi, what's 4(x-5)²?"" Himiko asked on the way to school. Kokichi raised his brow at her. 





   ""You didn't finish your algebra homework last night?"" he asked.





   ""It was too hard..."" Himiko pouted. Kokichi sighed.





  ""Okay, hang on,"" he said, closing his eyes in thought. ""4x²-40x+100.""





  ""Okaaay, and what's the answer to *that?* "" Himiko asked, writing down Kokichi's response.





   ""That *is* the answer, Himiko.""





""*WHAT?!* That just looks like another problem!!"" Himiko cried. 





   ""It's binomial expansion, Himiko. You're not really solving the problem, you're just *expanding* it,"" Kokichi explained. ""Hence, binomial *expansion.*""





   ""Nyeeeeh...more like *exacerbating* it! What's the point of math if you're not gonna solve the problem?! Nyeh...this is why math is such a pain,"" Himiko groaned. Kokichi smiled and shook his head. As they arrived at the entrance of Hope's Peak, Himiko felt a tap on her shoulder. She and Kokichi turned to see Shuichi.





   ""I didn't mean to eavesdrop, Himiko, but if you'd like, I could help you with algeb-"" he began, but was interrupted by a couple of students in white uniforms with red armbands suddenly strapping handcuffs around his wrists. 





  ""Shuichi Saihara, you've been sentenced to detention for standing five seconds too long in line at the water fountain tomorrow after gym class!"" Taka shouted. ""Take him away boys!""





   ""*Tomorrow?!* "" Shuichi exclaimed as Taka's hall monitor lackeys dragged him away. ""What do you mean *tomorrow?!* That doesn't make any sense!!""





   ""Huh...that's weird,"" Kokichi said as he and Himiko continued walking. Everywhere they looked, students all around them were being cuffed and sentenced to detention.





  ""Miu Iruma, you're being sentenced to detention for knocking Hifumi Yamada da fuggout on Friday!"" one of the hall monitors said





   ""The fuck?! You better let me go, dispshit, or I'll knock *you* da fuggout *next* Friday!!"" Miu threatened. 





   ""Teruteru Hanamura, you're being sentenced to detention for sneaking into the girls bathroom next week!"" cried another hall monitor. 





   ""Oh, wait!! If you're going to arrest me for it, at least let me see it first!"" Teruteru cried. Then, his nose started to bleed as he grinned lustfully. ""I'd...like to see what girls do in there. I bet it's really exciting.""





   ""Get movin,' sicko!"" the hall monitor exclaimed, shoving Teruteru in the direction of the detention room. 



 

   ""Why is Taka sentencing students to detention *before* they've broken the rules?"" Kokichi asked.





   ""Nyeh...who knows? He's probably going on another power trip,"" Himiko muttered, too focused on her math homework. Kokichi gave Himiko a mischievous grin.





   ""Hmm...well, whatever's going on, I think it's up to us to figure out-HEY!!!"" Kokichi was unable to finish what he was going to say as a couple of hall monitors slapped some handcuffs on him, as well. 





   ""Kokichi Ouma, you're being sentenced to detention for mooning the entire band class on Monday!"" one of them said. 





   ""No way!! You'll never take me alive!!"" Kokichi shouted, struggling to get away.





   ""Would you prefer we kill you instead?"" one of the hall monitors threatened in a low voice. Kokichi rolled his eyes in thought, contemplating before opening his mouth again.





   ""Orrr...instead of resorting to murder, you can just take me alive! Ever think of that, ya maniacs?!"" he answered. 





""That's what we thought,"" said the other hall monitor, and the two began dragging Kokichi away. 





  ""Nyeh...hey, Kokichi? What's 3(2x+5)²?"" Himiko asked. When Kokichi didn't answer, she turned around in shock to see him being dragged away. ""Kokichi!! Come back!! You hafta tell me the answer to this math problem!!""





   ""Urghh...woman!! I'm kinda busy here!!"" Kokichi cried, struggling against the hall monitors. ""Grghh...looks like you're gonna have to solve this case on your own, Himiko! Find Kazuichi! He might be able to tell you what's going on! Oh, and make sure you wear a detective outfit! You'll look cute in it! And take a picture and send it to me in case I don't make it ooouuuut!!"" Himiko raised an eyebrow and examined her outfit.





   *In that moment, I knew...it was up to* me *to solve the case. I ran--really slowly, 'cuz running is a pain--to the nearest girls bathroom and pulled my mage hat down, stretching it over my entire body. When I pulled it back up, my outfit magically changed. Nyeh...and my hat did this cute flippy thing before turning into a black fedora and landing on my head! I was now wearin' a black trench coat, white tights, and some black mary janes. I looked in the mirror. Nyeeeh!! The beau was right! I* do *look cute!*





  *After changing into the cutest magical detective ever...and takin' a picture of myself for the beau...I needed to figure out some stuff.*





  ""Like what the heck is 3(2x+5)², for crying out loud!!"" I cried out loud. 





   *The beau told me to look for Kazuichi Soda. I didn't think I'd find him in the library; if it ain't machines or his galpal, Miu, he wants nothin' to do with it. Kaz was lookin' like his usual squirrely self as he placed the books from the wheely cart onto the shelf...as if he had somethin' to hide. I walked over to the fanged fellow hoping to get some answers.*





  ""Nyeh...what's the deal, Kaz..."" I began. ""...with all these parentheses and exponents?! It just makes things even *more* confusing!!"" Kazuichi jumped.





   ""Hey, Yumeno!! Don't just pop up out of nowhere and scare me like that!!"" he cried. ""Besides, I don't know what you're talking about. Not that it matters. I have to stack all these books because of your annoying-ass boyfriend!""





   ""Nyeh..*Kokichi?!* "" I asked. ""What does *he* hafta do with this?""





""He thought it was funny to play a farting sound right as the librarian bent over to pick up a fallen book!"" Kazuichi said. ""Then he pinned the blame on me! Because of that, I got kicked off hall monitor duty, and was made to help the librarian with library duties!"" 





   ""Jeepers! Ain't my fella swell?"" I sighed quite dreamily. 





   ""No! He's nothing but a troublemaker!"" Kazuichi cried. ""He needs to learn some manners, for Pete's sake!""





   ""Nyeh...I dunno who Pete is, or what he has to do with this scenario, but no need to be a fuddy-duddy, mister,"" I said, placing my hand on my hip. ""Gee, you'd think someone as doll dizzy as yourself would be able to take a joke and have some fun.""





   ""Last time I checked, a joke is something that *everyone* can laugh at!"" Kazuichi said.





""SSSHHHHH!!!"" the librarian hushed. Kazuichi turned to me, then lowered his voice.





   ""Anyways...what do you want? I'm busy!""





   ""Don't snap your cap, kid. I think you know what I'm here for,"" I said. 





   ""Well, judging by your whole detective outfit, I'm guessing you wanna know about the whole detention thing with the hall monitors, right?"" Kazuichi asked.





   ""Oh! Uhhh...yeah..."" I replied, discreetly hiding my homework behind my back. 





   ""Well...t-too bad! It's not my place to speak about it! Now, go away already!"" Kaz exclaimed. I squinted my eyes at him.





   ""You know something,"" I said.





   ""N-No, I don't.""





   ""Nyeh...try and give me the slip, and the only slip *you'll* be gettin' in return is a *detention* slip! Now spill, Soda!"" I demanded.





   ""A-Alright! Alright! I'll spill!"" 





  *Finally, he started spillin' his guts faster than a butcher after a fresh kill.* 





  ""I'm still friends with some of the hall monitors, so I know what's been going down. It all started when Hiyoko forced her way into the lead position of the Public Morals Committee. Ever since then, the whole thing went to shit!""





   ""Hiyoko, huh? I thought Taka was in charge of the PMC.""





   ""Nah, he may be the lead hall monitor, but he's definitely not in charge of the whole committee. But, if there's anyone who's behind all these detainments, it's probably Hiyoko,"" Kaz continued.  ""Though, I don't know why-"" But before he could answer me, the hall monitors burst through the door and attacked him.





   ""Kazuichi Soda, you've been sentenced to detention for cutting class during biology tomorrow!"" one of 'em said as he handcuffed the poor pink-haired schnook. 





   ""AAAHHHH!!!"" Kazuichi screamed. 





   ""SSHHHH!!!"" the librarian shushed again. Kaz turned to me, his peepers large and shiny, as they usually were when he was flippin' his wig. 





   ""Listen, Yumeno!! I'm sure Hiyoko is behind this!! Find her!! She'll do the math for you!!""





   *And that was the last I saw of him. I grinned to myself.*





  ""She'll do the math for me, huh?"" *That's when I made like a dog next to a fire hydrant and went.* "
Notes on Deepseek r1: Just how good it is compared to OpenAI o1,OpenAI,1i9vjg7,2025-01-25 14:59:50,0,0.43,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i9vjg7/notes_on_deepseek_r1_just_how_good_it_is_compared/,SunilKumarDash,Discussion,"Finally, there is a model worthy of the hype it has been getting since Claude 3.6 Sonnet. Deepseek has released something anyone hardly expected: a reasoning model on par with OpenAI’s o1 within a month of the v3 release, with an MIT license and 1/20th of o1’s cost.

This is easily the best release since GPT-4. It's wild; the general public seems excited about this, while the big AI labs are probably scrambling. It feels like things are about to speed up in the AI world. And it's all thanks to this new DeepSeek-R1 model and how they trained it. 

Some key details from the paper

* Pure RL (GRPO) on v3-base to get r1-zero. (No Monte-Carlo Tree Search or Process Reward Modelling)
* The model uses “Aha moments” as pivot tokens to reflect and reevaluate answers during CoT.
* To overcome r1-zero’s readability issues, v3 was SFTd on cold start data.
* Distillation works, small models like Qwen and Llama trained over r1 generated data show significant improvements.

Here’s an overall r0 pipeline

* v3 base + RL (GRPO) → r1-zero

r1 training pipeline.

1. **DeepSeek-V3 Base** \+ SFT (Cold Start Data) → **Checkpoint 1**
2. **Checkpoint 1** \+ RL (GRPO + Language Consistency) → **Checkpoint 2**
3. **Checkpoint 2** used to Generate Data (Rejection Sampling)
4. **DeepSeek-V3 Base** \+ SFT (Generated Data + Other Data) → **Checkpoint 3**
5. **Checkpoint 3** \+ RL (Reasoning + Preference Rewards) → **DeepSeek-R1**

We know the benchmarks, but just how good is it?

# Deepseek r1 vs OpenAI o1.

So, for this, I tested r1 and o1 side by side on complex reasoning, math, coding, and creative writing problems. These are the questions that o1 solved only or by none before.

Here’s what I found:

* For **reasoning**, it is much better than any previous SOTA model until o1. It is better than o1-preview but a notch below o1. This is also shown in the ARC AGI bench.
* **Mathematics**: It's also the same for mathematics; r1 is a killer, but o1 is better.
* **Coding**: I didn’t get to play much, but on first look, it’s up there with o1, and the fact that it costs 20x less makes it the practical winner.
* **Writing**: This is where R1 takes the lead. It gives the same vibes as early Opus. It’s free, less censored, has much more personality, is easy to steer, and is very creative compared to the rest, even o1-pro.

What interested me was how free the model sounded and thought traces were, akin to human internal monologue. Perhaps this is because of the less stringent RLHF, unlike US models.

The fact that you can get r1 from v3 via pure RL was the most surprising.

For in-depth analysis, commentary, and remarks on the Deepseek r1, check out this blog post: [Notes on Deepseek r1](https://composio.dev/blog/notes-on-the-new-deepseek-r1/)

What are your experiences with the new Deepseek r1? Did you find the model useful for your use cases?"
"Goodbye, you were my lighthouse",outerwilds,1i9vicl,2025-01-25 14:58:27,8,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/comments/1i9vicl/goodbye_you_were_my_lighthouse/,mayonaiso,Base and DLC Appreciation/Discussion,"I know this title must  make it feel like this isn't a ow post but it is, please, if you have not finished the game or dlc please do not continue reading

When I first ended outer wilds I felt like it has sunk onto me but I didn't appreciate in that moment how much it would affect my personal life, this was years ago at this point but I still feel it like it was yesterday, I was in one of the best personal and emotional situations I could be, but unfortunately that was not the same when I arrived at the dlc like a year after, when I was close to the end my grandfather who I cannot love more and I feel like he's a lighthouse to what my life was, he transferred to me lots of my good qualities such as generosity little details and one of the things i love more: maths. They discovered he had cancer, with metastasis (I ain't sure what the English word is) but basically it was spreading and really really bad

As I've said he was my lighthouse but unfortunately I found myself start to see the moment where that light bulb would turn off and I wasn't sure how much could I navigate without him, how much did I want to navigate without him, unfortunately he died a moth afterwards but at least I had the option to say my goodbyes knowing they were probably my last words I would exchange with a grandfather who was surprisingly happy for someone who knew their final fate was close, and you would think whats the point in telling all this and all I can say is the next analysis

Even though I thought the game had sunk deep into me, I didn't learn the real lesson, that even when everything ends great things must go to make space for other great things, like the galaxy did, talking with chert and seeing him get sad seeing how close the end was, seeing the stars fade away as the time passed, seeing all go away, and being sad, what could you do, there's no other way to fight the end, and it's how we all deal with it.

But then I discovered what was inside the bell in the end of the dlc, the prisoner, and finding him, see that to get to a better place we might need to let go, to not be like the owlk, to be able to say goodbye and affront it with a smile, seeing that attitude and comparing it with my grandfather's I found why he was still smiling even in those awful situations (to make it clear, I don't want to make it seem as if saying goodbye was easy, or should be, I'm the first one whose eyes are crying a river writing this, but this is no crying post, is a hope one, so let's continue) 

We should learn that even when everything is bad we just have to fight and play our cards, like gandalf once said, it's not the times we have been given to live, but how we deal with them (it's not the literal sentence since I'm saying it from memory) and that's what this game showed me, making it sink in, even if I think I cannot accept it yet, there has only been less that 2 months and even if I don't find myself over it yet, (it also got worst when in the first month of his death I discovered one of my best friend was also fighting that battle against cancer but he didn't told most of his friends, trying to fight it silently, but I had discovered it, and he was given at most 5 years to live, but as this game has showed me, the end isn't the most important part when the journey is great) so I find today,  being 4 days away from the second month mark of his death a great moment to say my last goodbyes in this public later, to try and get my lesson further, do not be like the owlks, be like the prisoner, learn to deal with it, and be conscious even when beautiful things are going away it might be just for some other great things to come, even if it takes 14.3 billion years until it comes it will come in the end

So with all this being said, goodbye ""majo"" you were my lighthouse but now I must learn to give me myself enough light to continue navigating, I hope to be able to see you in the eye of the universe you've shown me a lot and I'll not let it fade away, now Im sure all stars are destined to became a supernova, but you'll always be the star that shine more

(Please save your comforting comments, these isn't a sad story but a great goodbye)"
