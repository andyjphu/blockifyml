The Ultimate Guide to Staking: Earn Passive Income with Crypto,DeFiYieldClub,1i9l35j,2025-01-25 06:32:43,5,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9l35j/the_ultimate_guide_to_staking_earn_passive_income/,Solanafluent,,"# 1. Introduction to Staking

# What is Staking?

Staking is a way to earn rewards on your crypto by locking it up to help secure a blockchain network. Instead of just holding your tokens, staking lets you put them to work and earn passive income. It‚Äôs like earning interest in a savings account, but for crypto.

# Proof of Stake (PoS) vs. Proof of Work (PoW)

* **PoW (Proof of Work)**: Used by Bitcoin, miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This requires a lot of computing power and energy.
* **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Instead of miners, validators are chosen based on how much crypto they stake. This method is more energy-efficient and allows for faster transactions.

# 2. Benefits of Staking

# Earn Passive Income

By staking, you receive rewards in the form of more crypto. For example, if you stake 100 SOL with a 8% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), you will earn 8 SOL over a year.

# Support Network Security

Stakers help validate transactions and prevent attacks. The more users staking, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes.

# Eco-Friendly Alternative to Mining

Unlike PoW mining, staking does not require large amounts of energy, making it a more sustainable way to support blockchain networks.

# 3. Types of Staking

# Direct Staking

* You lock up your assets directly on a blockchain.
* Requires technical knowledge.
* You are responsible for managing your stake.

# Delegated Staking

* You delegate your tokens to a trusted validator who stakes them for you.
* Easier for beginners.
* Validators take a small commission from your rewards.

# Liquid Staking

* You stake your assets but receive a liquid staking token (LST) like vSOL, mSOL, or JitoSOL, which can be used in DeFi.
* Allows you to stay liquid and use your staked funds for lending, farming, or other yield strategies.
* Higher rewards potential but involves smart contract risks.

# 4. How to Get Started with Staking

# Choosing the Right Crypto for Staking

* Popular staking tokens include **SOL (Solana), ETH (Ethereum), ADA (Cardano), and DOT (Polkadot).**
* Consider factors like staking yield, lock-up periods, and project credibility.

# Selecting a Wallet and Platform

* Use secure wallets like **Phantom, Ledger, or Solflare**.
* Choose a staking platform that offers transparency and security, such as **Marinade, Lido, Jito, or The Vault**.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Staking

1. **Choose a Wallet**: Set up a non-custodial wallet (etc Phantom for Solana or MetaMask for Ethereum).
2. **Select a Staking Provider**: Decide whether to stake directly with the network or through a third-party staking service.
3. **Stake Your Tokens**: Follow the platforms instructions to delegate your tokens.
4. **Track Your Rewards**: Use blockchain explorers or staking dashboards to track earnings.

# 5. Risks and Considerations

**Slashing Risks**

Some blockchains will put penalties if validators act corrupt or fail to validate transactions properly. Choosing a strong validator minimizes this risk.

# Lock-Up Periods

* Some networks require a **cooldown period** before you can unstake your tokens. Avoid CEX ( central exchanges at all costs) Coinbase even take a 35% cut from your rewards. That's insane.
* Liquid staking removes this issue but carries its own risks.

# Market Volatility

* Crypto prices goes up or down, so while you earn staking rewards, your staked assets value may decrease.
* Diversifying assets and strategies can help mitigate losses.

# 6. Advanced Staking Strategies

# Yield Farming with Liquid Staking

* Liquid staking tokens (vSOL, mSOL) can be used in **liquidity pools, lending platforms, or farming strategies** to earn extra rewards on top of staking yields. ( even more crypto)

# Restaking for Extra Rewards

* Some protocols allow **restaking**, where you use your liquid staking rewards to earn even more yield in different DeFi platforms.

# Diversification Strategy

* Split your stake across different validators to reduce risk and increase chances of better APY returns.

# Successful Staking Projects

* **Lido (ETH Staking)**: One of the largest staking platforms with liquid staking.
* **Marinade (SOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking.
* **The Vault (vSOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking focusing on community.

# 8. Future of Staking

# Emerging Trends

* **Increased Institutional Adoption**: More funds and enterprises staking crypto for yield.
* **Enhanced DeFi Integrations**: Liquid staking becoming central to yield strategies.

# Regulatory Considerations

* Some countries are **taxing staking rewards as income**, while others see them as capital gains.
* Decentralized staking may face **future regulatory review,** staying informed is key.

# Final Thoughts

Staking is one of the best ways to earn passive income in crypto while supporting network security. Whether you go for **direct staking, delegated staking, or liquid staking**, each method has its pros and cons. The key is to choose a strategy that fits your risk tolerance and investment goals.

New Discord Exploit: Please be safe!,Polkadot,1i7rl01,2025-01-22 20:13:25,17,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1i7rl01/new_discord_exploit_please_be_safe/,Dot_Anti-Scam_Team,,"A recent [report ](https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/45a3cdfa52246f1d1201c1e8cdef6117)by a young security researcher named Daniel, revealed a unique deanonymization exploit that targets platforms like Signal, Discord, and others relying on Cloudflare‚Äôs CDN. This exploit has the potential to approximate a user‚Äôs location within a 250-mile radius using caching data‚Äîa chilling reminder of how fragile privacy can be online. This is relevant considering the Polkadot Discord community has over 25k users, and it is the home of our community!

# How the Exploit Works

The attack leverages a mechanism in Cloudflare's Content Delivery Network (CDN):

1. A malicious payload prompts the target application (e.g., Discord or Signal) to request a specific resource.
2. Cloudflare caches the resource in the datacenter closest to the user.
3. The attacker analyzes the `cf-ray` header in the HTTP response, which contains the airport code of the datacenter.
4. Using this data, the attacker infers the target‚Äôs approximate location.

# Why This Matters for Web3 and Polkadot Users

The majority of crypto communities like Polkadot and other blockchains host their communities on Discord,  This exploit highlights the risks inherent even in tools we use and trust everyday:

* **Implications for Security:** Users in vulnerable or high-stakes scenarios (e.g., activists or developers) may be exposed to location tracking.
* **Relevance to Web3 Tools:** Many dApps and communication tools integrate with centralized services like CDNs, creating a potential attack surface.
* **Need for Vigilance:** As Web3 grows, threats like this remind us to regularly audit and assess third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities.

# How You Can Protect Yourself

* **Use a VPN:** Mask your IP to prevent accurate geolocation.
* **Minimize Trust in Centralized Services:** Whenever possible, use decentralized tools that prioritize end-to-end encryption and data privacy.
* **Stay Educated:** Understanding potential vulnerabilities is key to avoiding them.

We believe this is a great opportunity to discuss something vital for decentralized networks like Polkadot.  
Should Web3 move faster toward fully decentralized infrastructures to avoid centralized weak points like CDNs?

We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Let‚Äôs discuss how we can collectively protect our ecosystem from these evolving threats.

Trust has always been the cornerstone of human interaction, but for centuries we‚Äôve depended on institutions to mediate it. These structures are often slow, exclusionary, and prone to failure. Polkadot, powered by JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine), offers a transformative alternative‚Äîa system where trust is inherent, decentralized, and verifiable.

The promise of decentralization is not speculation or fleeting trends; it is resolving how we connect and  collaborate:

üîì **Trust through verification**: cryptography ensures reliability, removing the need for middlemen and gatekeepers.

üîó **Permissionless interoperability**: applications and chains to integrate seamlessly across industries and borders.

‚ö° **Scalable and adaptive**: Infrastructure that enables mass adoption without sacrificing decentralization or control.

Crypto‚Äôs past has largely been defined by financial experiments, but its future lies in creating tools and systems that underpin a new way of interacting‚Äîsecure, open, and universally accessible. Polkadot and JAM deliver the infrastructure for builders and innovators to go beyond payments and speculation, to create decentralized applications and services that work for everyone.

We‚Äôre not just building technology; we‚Äôre redefining how the world works together. This is a pivotal moment to design systems that empower, include, and inspire. We will deliver an internet that reflects our best ideals: transparent, resilient, and truly for all.

Together, we will build the global computer the world deserves. üíªüåç

 Unlocking the Power of Yield-Bearing Collateral with LSTs,polkadot_market,1i5izn6,2025-01-20 00:21:19,7,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/polkadot_market/comments/1i5izn6/unlocking_the_power_of_yieldbearing_collateral/,Sand4Sale14,,"**Polkadot Staking & Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking revolutionizes the way staked tokens are used by solving common issues like locked tokens, unbonding penalties, and lack of liquidity. It allows users to earn staking rewards while keeping their tokens liquid for DeFi activities. This innovation is particularly impactful in ecosystems like Polkadot.

**Bifrost & vTokens**  
Bifrost‚Äôs Liquid Staking protocol introduces vTokens‚Äîliquid staking tokens (LSTs) such as vDOT, vKSM, and others. These tokens act as yield-bearing collateral, earning staking rewards while staying usable across DeFi platforms for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Bifrost‚Äôs approach also enables cross-chain liquidity with LSTs like vETH.

**Why vDOT Stands Out**  
vDOT exemplifies the power of liquid staking in Polkadot, offering composability, liquidity, and integration with DeFi tools like LoopStake and Hydration. With trustless bridges like HyperBridge, vDOT‚Äôs utility is poised to expand, setting a benchmark for LSTs in yield-bearing collateral and driving broader DeFi innovation.

To people expecting price action from Polkadot 2 or JAM,polkadot_market,1i551tx,2025-01-19 13:21:36,26,0.89,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/polkadot_market/comments/1i551tx/to_people_expecting_price_action_from_polkadot_2/,LeftHandMorty,,"First let me say I am not a prophet, I don‚Äôt know what will happen and neither does anyone else. Everyone promising price action or a specific price is likely just trying to pump.

Aslo, this is not financial advice but purely my opinion based on my logic.

I have been reading a lot into polkadot and invested into it.

1. Currently I think polkadot with its Governance system and forkless upgrades is the most decentralized and quick to adapt blockchain. This is huge. Think about how long it took for Ethereum to update to pos and the forking it caused. In Polkadot this kind of change is much easier.

2. The updates for Polkadot 2 and JAM will turn Polkadot into the most performant truly decentralized blockchain there is.

Having said all that, these changes are very unlikely to create any price action short term for Polkadot. That‚Äôs because what creates price action are news that are likely to directly bring in morw buyers. Like for example a big company going into Dot, a big partnership, new game that will bring in more users, social network, etc. basically anything in the near future that will likely bring in more users and buyers directly is usually the cause for price action, not advanced tech.

But‚Ä¶ these tech updates are going to open more usecases for Polkadot that are currently impossible or very hard to implement on any other blockchain. This will cause projects/companies to choose Polkadot, because they have no other choice. And these companies and projects will hopefully bring in more users and buyers which will cause the price action.

That‚Äôs why anyone expecting quick gains after these upgrades is likely to be disappointed, however anyone sticking long term may enjoy gains unlike any other blockchain."

Wallet security,Polkadot,1i4zx6f,2025-01-19 09:42:49,16,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1i4zx6f/wallet_security/,Dot_Anti-Scam_Team,,"Wallets in crypto are probably one of the most basic ideas that people get introduced to when they embark on their crypto journey. The idea that you move funds onto a wallet and can then sign transactions is something we all probably already know and understand. But are you really as secure as you think you are / want to be? There are choices and safety practices that we should all be doing or considering, but many don't. These are, having a hardware wallet vs software wallet, how you secure your private keys, and how often you monitor your on-chain transactions to detect fraud.



Software vs Hardware Wallets

The argument between these two types of wallets can be summed up by asking ‚ÄúDo you want to prioritize security or convenience for managing your crypto?‚Äù. If you want to prioritize security over nothing else, then a hardware wallet may be for you! If you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice a bit of security in the name of convenience, then a software wallet will do just fine. Below are the main differences:¬†

	Software Wallet

* Locally stored private key to approve transactions
* Can be used without having to plug in a physical wallet
* Connected to the internet and therefore more accessible to attackers



Hardware Wallet

* Private key is stored within the hardware and not exposed to any outside connections
* Must physically interact with it in order to sign
* Remains offline until until signing a transaction



How Secure Are Your Private Keys?

This is a question we should all ask ourselves. If someone gained access to your computer, will they have access to your crypto wallets? If you have your private keys stored on your desktop then the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù. It‚Äôs important to store your private keys securely, even for a software wallet. Here are a few examples:



* Storing it in a physical format (I.e. a piece of paper placed someone secretly)
* In an encrypted file on a flash drive
* In an encrypted file in the cloud



Monitoring Wallet Activity

This is one of the most effective ways to detect and prevent any potential fraud or unauthorized access. By keeping your eyes on your on-chain data, you can quickly spot any suspicious behavior and take action accordingly. If you detect any suspicious transactions, it may be a good idea to swiftly relocate your funds onto a separate wallet. A few things to keep your eye out for are:



* Unusual account transfers
* Apps making transactions you didn‚Äôt approve
* Unknown apps making transactions
* Repeated small transactions¬†

Does Polkadot have a fun factor and why Solana pumped so high,polkadot_market,1i1zr6x,2025-01-15 10:22:25,10,0.7,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/polkadot_market/comments/1i1zr6x/does_polkadot_have_a_fun_factor_and_why_solana/,Eightsense,,"Solana went up 30x from its bear market low, because of [pump.fun](http://pump.fun)

I have been playing around with it for a week now and the amount of engagement and traffic is crazy. Makes Polkadot lika dead chain. Every second new coins join the market and its not just memes, for example the SEC announced yesterday that they made a website called Howeycoins to mimic a bogus coin offering to educate investors before they invest in a scam. This coin got released on pumpfun and has pumped from 10k to 10m in marketcap

Or trump tweeting about the new external revenue service battling IRS, this new coin ERS was released on pumpfun and rocketet aswell. People use third party trading softwares like bullx for more proffesional trading.

The smallest news and narratives get created, and if they hit 77k marketcap they migrate to Raydium dex, thousands of new coins per day.  Kanye tweets a goat picture, people make 10x within minutes, its crazy. Its a huge ecosystem and my mind was blown at how stagnant Polkadot network is in comparison.

Now guess what for all these coins you need SOL. Which creates huge demand. SOL has a massive use case here. Which is what Polkadot is lacking hard, you need DOT only for governance, staking and coretime which are very boring.

I hated Solana so bad and didnt know why the shitcoin pumped so hard, now from my own experience know that they nailed it. Polkadot needs to come up with something that gets people engaged and excited requiring DOT. Imagine they put the tens of millions of garbage bullshit stickers on sportteams and private planes, they would do something productive like this instead. Absolute losers who voted for such things, Polkadot has the dumbest whales.

I dont know what is down the line for Polkadot to create such effect, but it has the funds, it has the devs. With JAM coming i hope devs create something that gets people wanting to engage like pumpfun levels."

Trust has always been the cornerstone of human interaction, but for centuries we‚Äôve depended on institutions to mediate it. These structures are often slow, exclusionary, and prone to failure. Polkadot, powered by JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine), offers a transformative alternative‚Äîa system where trust is inherent, decentralized, and verifiable.

The promise of decentralization is not speculation or fleeting trends; it is resolving how we connect and  collaborate:

üîì **Trust through verification**: cryptography ensures reliability, removing the need for middlemen and gatekeepers.

üîó **Permissionless interoperability**: applications and chains to integrate seamlessly across industries and borders.

‚ö° **Scalable and adaptive**: Infrastructure that enables mass adoption without sacrificing decentralization or control.

Crypto‚Äôs past has largely been defined by financial experiments, but its future lies in creating tools and systems that underpin a new way of interacting‚Äîsecure, open, and universally accessible. Polkadot and JAM deliver the infrastructure for builders and innovators to go beyond payments and speculation, to create decentralized applications and services that work for everyone.

We‚Äôre not just building technology; we‚Äôre redefining how the world works together. This is a pivotal moment to design systems that empower, include, and inspire. We will deliver an internet that reflects our best ideals: transparent, resilient, and truly for all.

Together, we will build the global computer the world deserves. üíªüåç

**Welcome to the week!** üåê

All discussion is welcome here including conversations about the price of the DOT token, related tokens, markets and economy of the Polkadot crypto economic system.

You will find a wider audience at [/r/polkadot](https://reddit.com/r/polkadot) but please do not discuss prices of tokens including DOT there. Do it here üòä"
The Anti-Scam Weekend Report,Polkadot,1hztleo,2025-01-12 13:43:51,12,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1hztleo/the_antiscam_weekend_report/,Dot_Anti-Scam_Team,,"Last week we covered some basic tactics that scammers use to take advantage of people. This week we are going to expand on that topic a little further with a few more things to keep your eyes out for. These are fake giveaways that promise too much, QR codes that lead to malicious places, and fake customer support users.



Fake GiveawaysThese types of scams range from small projects that try to steal your wallet information whenever you connect to their website, all the way up to fake Polkadot giveaways that promise to double the amount of $DOT you send in. Be on the lookout for:



1. Promises to double your DOT: These scams request that you send DOT to an address with the promise that they will send you more back.
2. Fake teams impersonating projects: As discussed last week, scammers will go to great lengths to impersonate legitimate projects and take advantage of people. This is true for fake giveaways too.
3. Fake verification for airdrop: This type of scam asks users to ‚Äúverify‚Äù their identity to cash in on the airdrop they‚Äôre eligible for. In other words, they ask you to send, for example, 0.1 DOT in order to receive 1 DOT.¬†



QR Code ScamsAs QR codes get more and more widespread, so do malicious QR codes. These are especially tricky because, unlike a link, it‚Äôs very difficult to tell if it's malicious until you scan it. Here‚Äôs how you can stay safe:



1. Verify the sender: Double check that the sender is who they say they are. If it is out of character for them, they may have even been hacked. Stay vigilant!
2. Avoid scanning QR codes from unverified sources altogether: This way, you don't put yourself at any unnecessary risk.
3. Only scan codes from trusted sources: Another way you can stay safe is to only scan QR codes if it comes from a trust source. Such as platforms you already use and know are safe.



Fake Customer Support

The last type of scam we will be covering today is fake customer support. These individuals usually DM you after you ask a question on X (formerly twitter) or Discord. They pretend to be a moderator and offer you assistance. Or, they will randomly DM you and say that you must ‚Äúact quickly‚Äù or risk losing your funds. In either case, here is how you can stay safe:



1. Ignore the DM: Almost 100% of the time, moderators / admins will not DM you. If they do, they typically let you know beforehand.¬†
2. Verify the user: If you do believe this person may actually be a moderator / admin, try to verify their identity. Check over their profile or even cross reference the user IDs if you‚Äôre using Discord.
3. Report them: The best way to stay safe against this type of scam is to report the account. If everyone does their part, there will be less accounts participating in this scam.



In this cryptocurrency world, scammers are ever-evolving to try and take money in illegitimate ways. Whether its fake giveaways, malicious QR codes, or fake customer support, knowing what to look out for and how to stay protected will always make a difference.

Polkadot.js API level-set,Polkadot,1hyryqs,2025-01-11 03:57:40,16,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1hyryqs/polkadotjs_api_levelset/,Eye-Catching,,"Hello, I've recently been tinkering with the **utility.batch** Extrinsic using Polkadot.js and it's given me an idea of a facility I'd like to provide myself, a kind of helper if you will. I'd like to have an Event listener that is aware of when a deposit is made to address, it then kicks off 'code' that does a **nominationPool.bondExtra** (of an amount slightly less than the amount deposited) and then checks the free balance and does a **balances.transferAllowDeath**, leaving 0 DOT.

After researching, I *believe* something like this can *only* be achieved via the API.

I've read up on the documentation and (because there appears to be some non-trivial installation requirements and a steeper learning curve, and I'm running Windows which adds its own issues) I wanted to check if there's a way to dip my toes into the API via the Polkadot,js web UI or some downloadable fat(ter) client. I'm especially interested if there's a way to listen to the Event when a deposit lands at an address.

I've seen some great examples out there (https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/examples/promise/listen-to-balance-change/) and I've even blasted off a **utility.batch** with **nominationPools.bondExtra** and **balances.transferAllowDeath** but the amounts of DOT I've entered have just been entered, rather than been returned via some call, obviously."

Polkadot System Capability: Tik Tok?,Polkadot,1hxyd4e,2025-01-10 01:33:00,17,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1hxyd4e/polkadot_system_capability_tik_tok/,Asianfoam7,,"About a year ago Frank McCourt mentioned that he wanted to buy the rights to Tik Tok in the USA and move it over to the Polkadot network.

The owners of Tik Tok, ByteDance, have stated that they do not intend to sell the USA rights to Tik Tok in the event that they are banned. They will simply peace-the-F-out. 

So in 3 hypotheticals (a crypto parlay if you will) 1) The USA Bans Tik Tok 2) Kevin O Leary & Frank McCourt buy the USA rights to Tik Tok 3) Frank McCourt follows through with his goal of putting Tik Tok on the Polkadot network...

Technologically speaking, could the DOT network realistically support an app of that magnitude? "

The setup is that I have 1 address with 3 DOT (Polkadot.js says free balance is 2.7801¬†dot) and 2 receiving addresses. I have a **utility.batch (calls)** Extrinsic with 2 calls to **balances.transferAllowDeath** added.

In the **balances.transferAllowDeath** I have the 2 receiving addresses with a value of **1000000000** (which I hope is 0.1 DOT.

If I attempt that then the first transfer gets a return code of **0** and the second **1**. The first address does get 0.1 DOT. Polkadot.js shows the error - **utility.batchInterrupted** \- and says - **error: 0: Token.FundsUnavailable** \- yet I can do it again and the first address will still receive 0.1 DOT (and there's almost 3 DOT there).

If I try the same but using **utility.batchAll** then, of course, the whole thing fails but I still see the same return codes for each **transferAllowDeath**.

Looking at Subscan, I do see **""value"":""10000000000000000000""** for each call to **transferAllowDeath** which confuses me as I enter **1000000000** in the UI and, at least with **batch**, 0.1 DOT is received at one address (with the other failing). If I send 0.1 DOT with Talisman then I see **1000000000** in Subscan.

I'm missing something blatant here, I've watched a video (linked from the Batch Transfers section at https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-transfers) on how to do this (with Westend), but I have no idea what it is I'm missing.

**P.S.** \- the same outcome is seen with **transferKeepAlive**.

P.S. - the same **FundsUnavailable** message is seen even if I set the amount to **1000000**."

Price Action is the Only Thing That Matters RN,polkadot_market,1hvps0t,2025-01-07 06:54:01,55,0.98,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/polkadot_market/comments/1hvps0t/price_action_is_the_only_thing_that_matters_rn/,Dry_Scholar_5418,,"I've been lurking in here for quite a while and usually, I don't get involved, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts. I've been a staunch supporter of Polkadot from its early days - ‚ÄúI accidentally killed it‚Äù, Funkhaus etc...

  
Let's confront the stark reality of DOT's price performance. It's akin to seeing NVIDIA's stock price plummet while their technology dominates the market. Here's the thing: Polkadot's SDK is being embraced by projects like Cardano, Avail, and TAO, proving its technological edge, yet the DOT price doesn't echo this success. This isn't just about financial gain; in the crypto world, price action is the loudest advertisement, the most effective marketing tool, and the key to attracting developers, users, and investors.  
  
The stakes are high: not only do we risk losing momentum, but we risk DOT fading into irrelevance.   
  
Consider this

* Marketing: The price of a token is the first impression in the crypto market. A rising price signals to the world that something significant is happening. It's the narrative that captures headlines, generates buzz, and draws in the curious. If DOT's price languishes, we're mute in a cacophony of viral projects.
* Attraction: Developers build where there's opportunity. A vibrant price action indicates growth potential, which is magnetic for talent looking for the next big platform. Without this, Polkadot becomes a niche tech without the community to drive it forward.
* Retention: Current holders, including the early believers, need to see their faith in the technology rewarded through price appreciation. A stagnant or declining price can lead to disillusionment, selling off, and a loss of community strength.
* Retirement: For many, crypto investment is about securing future financial stability. If DOT doesn't perform, it's not just about losing money; it's about losing the dream of what blockchain could offer in terms of financial independence.

The upcoming JAM upgrade is poised to be a leap akin to the transition from Nokia 3310 to iPhone in terms of blockchain innovation. But if the price doesn't reflect this leap forward, it will be like having the most advanced tech in a forgotten lab‚Äîrevolutionary yet invisible to the market.  
  
The ""long-term play"" narrative feels like wishful thinking. After the last cycle, DOT's performance was underwhelming. We're still stuck with old narratives of parachains and staking. We need a new story, and that story won't be written in whitepapers alone; it'll be charted in price action. DOT must ride the current market waves to stay relevant, not just as another tech project but as a leader in the blockchain revolution.  
  
The TikTok opportunity looms large. If there's even a whisper that Frank McCourt might leverage Polkadot for TikTok, every single part of our ecosystem should be laser-focused on making that happen. Without price action, we're not just less competitive; we're out of the race entirely.  
  
We're at a crossroads. The crypto market is now geared towards ""sell now, figure out later."" If DOT doesn't see significant price action, we're not just talking about a dip; we're talking about DOT fading into obscurity.   
  
To Parity, W3F, the Fellowship, Gavin, Bill, the Kusamarians, VCs, and every human, alien, cyborg, and sentient AI from all corners of the multiverse - whether you're from the land of sushi, tacos, pasta, biltong, or just the good ol' burger - to the tech bros, crypto bros, bro-ettes, and non-binary bros, to the straight, the queer, the questioning, the fabulous, and the ""I'm here for the free pizza"" crowd, to the young, the old, the ageless (looking at you, vampires), the hipsters, the boomers, the zoomers, and the ""I refuse to be labeled"" crew, to the ex-pats, the nomads, the urbanites, the country folk, the beach bums, and the space enthusiasts, to every ethnicity, religion, or lack thereof, to the cat people, dog people, bird people, and those who just love their pet rocks, to the gender-fluid, cis, trans, intersex, bigender, agender, pan-gender, and those who identify as ""a mood"" - if you're invested in this vision, listen up:  
  
The price of DOT must rocket to the moon, or we're all just going to be stuck in this blockchain purgatory, watching as other projects throw the coolest parties in the metaverse. It's not just about the numbers; it's about survival, recognition, and ensuring Polkadot doesn't become the next MySpace of crypto. We're teetering on the edge of either a glorious renaissance or a sad, meme-filled decline. This is our moment to grab the universe by the horns, or we'll be relegated to the sidelines, eating our metaphorical popcorn while others dance in the spotlight of success. Let's make DOT go up, or we'll all be left explaining to our grandkids why we didn't become space millionaires.  


Call to Action:  


* Shill the shit out of every announcement: Coordinate a massive shilling campaign from the official Polkadot account, KOLs, Gavin, Bill, W3F, the Fellowship‚Äîeveryone. Stop posting technical details only developers care about. Spin it into narratives that retail investors can rally behind.
* Engage in every single discussion on Crypto Twitter (CT): Debunk myths, spread facts, and keep the conversation alive. If you want to code, hire an army of shillers and account managers to amplify your voice.
* You need developers, but developers need degenerates: To bring their work into the light of day, tell the gospel of Polkadot. Developers create, but it's the community that evangelizes.
* Get VCs to shill: Have the money makers use every financial tool and trick in the book to push the price. 
* Avoid internal public fights: Keep the community aligned at all costs. Don't debate proposals on CT; use the forum for that. Project positivity, positivity, positivity.
* Internalize the greatness: Let the positive vibes pump the price. 
* Attract big names: Get Aave, Curve, Compound, TikTok, Revolut, Visa‚Äîwhatever it takes. Figure out the details later. Throw resources at attracting these giants to Polkadot.
* Support existing projects: Fund them, promote them, and ensure they mention Polkadot everywhere. In return, we do the same for them. Provide anything they need to thrive and shine a light on Polkadot.

This is our time to make Polkadot not just a technological choice but the talk of the crypto town. Let's act now, with full force, to ensure DOT doesn't just survive but thrives."
Staking Explained in Simple Terms: What It Is and How Beginners Can Earn,u_Ok_Note8852,1hvp53e,2025-01-07 06:11:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Note8852/comments/1hvp53e/staking_explained_in_simple_terms_what_it_is_and/,Ok_Note8852,,"In traditional finance, a popular way to earn passive income is by keeping money in bank deposits or low-risk investments in bonds. This approach helps grow capital and generate stable returns in the long term. Digital asset holders do not have access to these options, but they can earn through staking ‚Äî a mechanism that allows users to earn rewards by contributing to the security of a given network.

In this article, we will explain what staking is, how it works, the advantages it can offer investors, and the risks involved.

https://preview.redd.it/1xu7ktmi1kbe1.jpg?width=2600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b6f20bc05e4cdde2acbd5082eee55f8b245028

# What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm that powers blockchain operations, transaction verification, and network protection from malicious actors. It was designed as a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW), where network security is ensured by computational power. In PoS, tokens become the main resource for participating in consensus. Participants lock their assets to become validators, and the network selects those who will verify transactions and add new blocks. The chances of becoming a validator depend on the number of locked tokens, as well as other factors such as staking duration and randomness.

To ensure validator loyalty, PoS uses a penalty mechanism known as ""slashing."" If a network participant violates the rules, their assets can be partially or fully confiscated.

Due to these features, Proof-of-Stake has become a key element of modern blockchains, offering an energy-efficient solution for maintaining consensus and making participation accessible to any token holder. Staking is at the core of PoS.

# What is Native Staking?

Native staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency directly in a blockchain to support its operation and earn rewards. Participants in native staking can also become validators, helping verify transactions, create new blocks, and maintain network security. To participate in native staking, a special wallet and a minimum number of tokens are usually required, depending on the blockchain's requirements.

However, locking assets for staking does not automatically grant validator status. Validators must also launch their own nodes, so for users who cannot or do not want to do this, the option to delegate their tokens is available. They transfer assets to one of the validators via specialized platforms and receive a portion of their reward.

# Liquid Staking and Restaking

Modern approaches to utilizing tokens to support blockchains, in addition to native staking, include two key trends: liquid staking and restaking. These expand the possibilities of using staked assets, making the process more flexible and profitable.

Liquid staking allows users to lock their assets to support the network in exchange for liquid tokens that represent their staked assets. These tokens can be used in DeFi protocols for earning, trading, or investing. Thus, liquid staking solves the issue of asset freezing that is typical of traditional staking. Restaking is a mechanism that allows users to reuse assets already locked in staking. It is applied to secure additional networks or protocols.

For example, in the EigenLayer project, Ethereum validators can offer their staked tokens to secure new decentralized applications, cross-chain bridges, or oracles. In return, they earn additional rewards.

However, restaking also carries higher risks: validators may face penalties if they violate the rules of the additional protocols, potentially losing assets.

# Staking vs. Farming and Mining

Staking, farming, and mining are three different approaches to earning in the crypto industry, with distinct goals, requirements, and risks. However, beginners often confuse them, perceiving them as similar methods of earning passive income through digital assets.

It's important to remember that staking is considered a more eco-friendly solution for securing a blockchain compared to mining. In both cases, users can actively participate in the network, but mining requires powerful hardware that consumes a significant amount of electricity. In PoS networks, validators only need to lock their tokens to help secure the network.

Farming (or yield farming) has a different nature but often involves ""staking,"" i.e., locking assets. In this case, users freeze their tokens in smart contracts to provide liquidity to decentralized protocols, such as exchanges or lending platforms.

Rewards from farming are often paid in governance tokens or transaction fees. Unlike staking, farming is not related to network security. Instead, it is used to provide liquidity or other functions in DeFi. However, farming carries additional risks, including impermanent loss, which occurs when the prices of assets locked in pools fluctuate.

This comparison helps understand which method is best suited for a user's specific goals.

# Advantages and Risks of Staking

**Main Benefits of Staking:**

* **Passive income:** Locked tokens continue to work for their owner, earning rewards without requiring active involvement. This makes staking especially attractive for long-term investors.
* **Network support:** Through staking, users help ensure the security and stability of the blockchain, becoming an integral part of its ecosystem.
* **Accessibility:** Staking does not require expensive equipment. All that is needed is cryptocurrency and the appropriate software.

**Risks and Drawbacks of Staking:**

* **Market volatility:** The value of tokens can drop sharply, leading to losses that may outweigh the earned rewards.
* **Technical risks:** Assets may be lost due to errors in smart contracts, hacking attacks, or loss of access to a wallet. These risks increase when using intermediary providers.
* **Inaccessibility of tokens:** Locked assets cannot be used, limiting liquidity and the ability to sell quickly. Liquid staking platforms are an exception.
* **Slashing risk:** In case of errors or malicious actions by the validator, part of the staked assets may be confiscated as a penalty. This can apply both to the user and to the validator they delegated their assets to.

Many of these risks can be minimized with a careful approach, such as choosing reliable providers or delegating assets to trustworthy validators with a good reputation and high reward shares. It's also important to monitor the state of the crypto market and the price dynamics of the selected asset.

# Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Staking

The key metric when choosing a network and platform for staking is APY (Annual Percentage Yield), which reflects the annual return considering reward reinvestment. It‚Äôs important to balance rewards, network reliability, and asset volatility.

Here is a list of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies for staking as of this article‚Äôs writing, according to Staking Rewards.

1. **Ethereum (ETH):** The largest PoS blockchain with $132.4 billion locked in staking. The network offers an APY of 3.48%.
2. **Solana (SOL):** Known for high transaction speeds and low fees. $91.2 billion locked, with an APY of 6.65%.
3. **Sui (SUI):** A next-gen blockchain quickly gaining popularity. $33 billion locked, with an APY of 2.81%.
4. **Cardano (ADA):** One of the earliest and most stable PoS networks. $26 billion locked, with an APY of 2.67%.
5. **Binance Coin (BNB):** Native token of Binance Smart Chain. $21.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.22%.
6. **Tron (TRX):** One of the oldest blockchains with staking. $13 billion locked, with an APY of 4.65%.
7. **Aptos (APT):** A rapidly developing network competing with Sui. $12.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.00%.
8. **Avalanche (AVAX):** A popular ecosystem with high transaction speeds. $12.41 billion locked, with an APY of 7.79%.
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** A blockchain with unique architecture supporting parachains. $8.65 billion locked, with an APY of 11.96%.
10. **Celestia (TIA):** A modular blockchain launched in 2023. $6.12 billion locked, with an APY of 10.69%.

These projects offer unique opportunities for users wishing to earn through staking due to varying reward parameters and use cases.

# Conclusion

Staking is a way to earn passive income and actively participate in supporting blockchain operations. Its popularity is explained by energy efficiency compared to mining, ease of participation, and the potential for stable rewards.

However, participating in the network‚Äôs infrastructure requires understanding technical processes and associated risks. For beginners, staking can offer an easy and accessible way to earn, provided they use providers that lower the entry barrier and technical complexities. It's crucial to carefully choose platforms and projects to minimize potential threats.

With innovations like liquid staking and restaking, users have even more tools to manage their assets flexibly. These solutions make the process more convenient and appealing for both experienced investors and newcomers eager to integrate into the crypto ecosystem."

	After the chaotic 4 months of war and reclaiming captial citizens were hyped for  the new year of the hunger games. Panems new victor Veronica Canvil had been enjoying her life of richness and joy starting up her now infamous wine company ‚Äúroyalty and prime‚Äù. Veronica had been spending her morning in her home with  her new workers and her family testing certain berries that were transported to district 1 from district 9 and 11. However she did receive the usual call to conduct the reaping tour. Her permitted guests were her boyfriend, her mother and her older brother were granted passageway. Her first stop at district 9 wasnt that bright as Camelio the male tribute for the district attempted to break Veronica‚Äôs nose but a peacekeeper and Devin her boyfriend to rip Camelio off of Veronica with the later screaming ‚ÄúFOR MY GIRLFRIEND BITCH‚Äù.  What Camelio really didn't know was that it was not Veronica who killed Piefer with the boy earning  a broken nose and black eye in response. Her next stop that followed as district 7 was what commentators called Veronica's ‚Äúnot so favorite district‚Äù.

	Her entourage landed at the crest where they were greeted by Mayor Sticks and Flora PetalBloom (victor of the 126th hunger games) who rolled her eyes after seeing what Flora dubbed ‚Äúmadam snob‚Äù. Still Mayor Hillary Sticks maintained peace between the ladies leading Veronica and her entourage on a brief tour through the deep forest areas first. However a fight soon had to be stopped when Flora quietly mocked Devin, Veronica‚Äôs boyfriend, on his ‚Äúmusty look‚Äù. As a cat fight soon took place Hilary and Mrs.Canvil had to quash it as Flora‚Äôs hair was quite ripped and Veronica‚Äôs beautiful ruby gown. The tour was brought to a stop while the ladies fixed themselves up Devin and Mayor Sticks chatted for a while at the mayor's manor where the enetrouge now resided.

	During this talk the brown cadered youths of the district were shepherded into their respective age zones  within the square. After a 35 minute wait Flora popped back out first mustering a groan and jeers from the square with Nancy Anderson lead editor of Anderson Fashion commented how they ‚Äúmust have not gotten over Chuck‚Äôs death after 6 years‚Äô.When Veronica entered back onto the stage in a glitter ruby jumpsuit Flora let out a bemused laugh however when Veronica looked at her and asked ‚ÄúWhat you gonna set me on fire now you literally won your games by sitting in a room.‚Äù, However Mayor Sticks now angry grabbed the two y the scruffs of their necks causing quite the bewilderment of laughs in Snow Square with Cyrus joking ‚Äúi never liked the fire girl anyway‚Äù. After Hillary dropped the too victors Veronica gave a brief speech about the importance of the games and joked to ‚Äúnot treat it like a holiday and too geneuly fight like the true warriors there mommies and daddies believed them to be‚Äù. And without a further of a do she walked over to the female reaping bowl.


	18 year old Sharon Matthews was announced as the female tribute of district 7. Sharon was spotted in the back corner  with a frightened glance, her fluffy blonde curls and pearl face becoming more bright in the early morning sunrise. Sharon screamed before ripping her brown dress‚Äôs sleeves before stomping up to the stage with an angry scowl resulting in many citizens in snow square to laugh and Nancy to comment ‚ÄúSomeone woke up not in their tree‚Äù. As Peacekeepers brought Sharon up to the stage she  refused to shake Veronica‚Äôs hand but once  a peacekeeper butted  her gun at the back of Sharon‚Äôs head she shook her hand earning a joyful smile of approval from Veronica and Mayor Sticks.

	Afterward the male tribute was ordered to be called as Veronica did so she called the name of 15 year old Hawk Morgan. A pin drop could be heard at the quiet followed as Cameras flew to a well known trapper of the district. The boy was quite skinny having short beige hair that was styled well skin  pearl skin  a smattering of freckles  and heterochromia green and browneyes also being adorned in a brown tank top and rugged jeans. Cyrus was surprised at the skinniness of this tribute with Nancy after reading his tribute identification card replying he ‚Äúate food sparingly‚Äù. The audience praised this claim as  Hawk noticed one boy behind him laughing saying ‚Äúaww the twig can't out run this near death experience huh‚Äù. However, Hawk pinched the nerve of this boy's neck causing him to fall limp. While the audience in Snow square laughed, Hawk replied ‚ÄúI guess you can't out run this Philp‚Äù.  As the other nearby youths were in shock, peacekeepers made their way to Hawk however he kicked Philp in the face  resulting in many of the boy's friends in the  16 and 17 year old  section to applaud. Finally when the peacekeeper tried to drag him up  to the stage he replied gently ‚ÄúI don't need  a crossing garud to walk me‚Äù. As the peacekeeper pinched him on the arm, Hawk walked to the stage. When on the stage he complimented Veronica‚Äôs ruby jumpsuit resulting in a less angry  carrer mentor thanking him.

	After walking to his section Veronica announced the paris tributes for district 7 while applause followed Veronica and her entourage had been hightailed it to their hovercraft to district 4 next apparently the Pine smell and ‚ÄúArsonist‚Äù was too much for them. Mayor Sticks brought  them to their families. This  year was one of those odd years where not too many people visited the tributes with Sharon shoooing her mother out of the meeting room after she was hysterically claiming that the gods were ‚Äúdamming them‚Äù. On the other side of the meeting hall Hawk was met by his mother and  many of his school friends which surprisingly peacekeepers overlooke this. His mother made sure to check if her boy was ok seeing his newly acquired  scratches from Philp. He reassured his mum that he was fine as one of his hunting mates Jerome joked with Mrs Morgan that ‚ÄúOl chum will be fine‚Äù.  Another hunting mate Damion the boy who hyped up the others when Hawk stood up for himself. Hawk hugged Damion claiming he felt afraid but the boy smiled telling him to ‚ÄúHone agility and speed‚Äù. Hawk nodded and when the bell to leave the fair well rooms was heard  he hugged his mother and friends that were there before leaving the domicile joining Sharon before the pair from 7 left for the captial.

	When they boarded the train since the horse drawn carreiges were removed the pair marveled at the fine architecture. Sharon laughed at Hawk‚Äôs  frail complexion before asking ‚ÄúYou gonna eat the money if you win‚Äù. Hawk rolled his eyes before  walking toward the library  carriage taking a book about Johanna Mason (victor of the 71st hunger games) and sitting at the bar carriage. While Sharon was in the process of inbereating herself Hawk soon placed the book back on the shelf mumbling ‚ÄúLunatic axe lady‚Äù.  The two did stop when seeing their mentors arriving. The lady with well kept red hair chastised Flora for ‚ÄúCausing mentor discourse‚Äù causing Flora to joke in a sing-songy voice ‚ÄúSnooby snobby ass hole‚Äù.  However Belle Figeoura (Victor of the 112th hunger games) rolled her eyes before noticings their tributes. Flora laughed and called Hawk a ‚ÄúAnorexic bison‚Äù. What caused a circus of laughs in snow square was Hawk sneakily snatching the bottle of Liquor out of Sharon‚Äôs hand before dumping it down Flora‚Äôs hair. While she shrieked, Sharon laughed and joked ‚ÄúI like you kid wanna ally‚Äù. Hawk laughed and joked ‚Äúthat changed your mind huh‚Äù. While the two confirmed an alliance Belle laughed before introducing herself to her tributes.  As Sharon turned her attention back to her liquor bottle Flora came back saying ‚Äú I have the girl you take Twiggy‚Äù. ‚ÄúIm not a twig madam arsenit‚Äù. Flora laughed again saying ‚ÄúHe's a comedian too, we have this in the bag‚Äù before taking a high ball and drinking away with  Sharon.


	Belle asked Hawk if he wanted to ‚ÄúGet away from the lollies‚Äù. Hawk laughed and nodded before the pair switched over to the dining carriage. An avox brought in  a nice steak with seasoned french fries and abnormally large broccoli stalks. While Belle simply enjoyed a nice flask of red wine and  chicken parmesan. Belle asked the boy if he wanted to watch any of the past 31 hunger games. The boy clammed up for a second but Belle noticed this before replying ‚Äúa less bloody one‚Äù. Hawk nodded before Belle rummaged through old video tapes before putting all 31 out on the table asking Hawk to  choose 2 besides the 112nd games that Belle wanted to show to him regardless of choice. The boy chose the 113th games and the 116th games. While the  113th games played and  Belle gave her commentary, cameras went back to Flora and Sharon conversing through drinks.


	Sharon  burped dramatically which made Flora laugh like a hyena drunkenly asking the girl if she was good with axes or fire. After burping after another swig of vodka Sharon replied she ‚Äúnever left the forests‚Äù. Flora tossed her beer bottle out the window, hitting a stray factory worker from district 5 in the face. After being sharply reminded by peacekeepers on the train to ‚Äúwatch the alcohol consumption‚Äù.  Sharon took a hangover pill from an avox and after the two ladies spent 45 minutes vomiting courtesy of withdrawal from the booze  Flora walked Sharon to the combat carriage where she  soon barked at an avox in her signature scottish hiss to bring a rack of axes in and told the girl to ‚Äúshow the strength she claimed to have‚Äù. Sharon proceeded to hurl axes left and right at targets unfortunately missing every and andeven hitting an avox on accident. As the avox was hurried away Flora laughed and playful reminded her ‚ÄúWatch your aim‚Äù. Sharon felt bad and apologized profusely but thankfully the avox was tended to and made a speedy recovery. Flora soon knocked on the door to see Belle who was in the process of giving her rundown on the 112th games the ones she won to Hawk.

 	When hearing the knock Belle rolled her eyes saying the lollies had returned. Hawk rolled his eyes at seeing Flora with Flora mocking the boy. Belle soon asked Flora if ‚Äúanything productive was done‚Äù or ‚Äúdid she wast the new year getting drunk off of booze‚Äù. Flora rolled her eyes saying her ‚ÄúWarrior axed an avox‚Äù.Belle soon sighed resulting in Flora calling her‚ÄùGrandma‚Äù. This was not too wise of the arsonist to do this as Belle put her co mentor in a choke hold and knocked her out. As Flora thankfully still had a pulse Belle took a gulp of vodka before sighing  again telling Sharon ‚ÄúI'm mentoring you both‚Äù. Sharon seemed to have no problem with this with her drly telling Belle she was getting tired of ‚Äú Skinny shaming and requests to just take these games as a bloody holiday.‚Äù After Sharon ate Belle praised them for acting valuent so far with her rejoicing the fact that district 7s reputation might be healed. Belle soon shooed them to bed however as Sharon happily did this she pulled Hawk aside. The boy claimed he was exhausted, resulting in Belle promising the 15 year old she would ‚Äúmake it quick‚Äù. She pulled up a portrait of the male tribute of district 3 Kade Merlson  of the 126th hunger games asking ‚ÄúSee any similarities ‚Äú. The boy shrugged however when Belle turned on the 126th hunger games Hawk took a glance at Chuck before his face. When Belle asked if the boy was ok Hawk asked if  Flora ‚Äúwas supposed to be the male or female  mentor‚Äù. Belle replied that herself was originally  the female mentor while an old friend ‚Äúgave her accounts‚Äù of Flora ‚Äúfavoring‚Äù the male tributes more than the female  tributes citing Calla(7) as an example but stopped when Flora abruptly awoken saying ‚Äúshe was an idiot anyway‚Äù.

    Belle groaned before telling Flora to ‚Äúbugger off ‚Äú. Flora continued to be an issue, mocking Chuck saying he was like a ‚Äúlost puppy‚Äù before she finished this syllable she grabbed her cheek in pain. Hawk rolled his eyes asking Flora if she ever ‚Äúshut up‚Äù however as the two soo. Went at it Belle sat there and watched which caused Sharon to awake and look on in bewilderment at the cat fight. She asked ‚Äúwithdrawal?‚Äù. 
Belle nodded joking ‚ÄúI hope one of you win, I can't stand this girl ‚Äú. Hawk had almost gotten curve stomped by Flora  but it was indeed Sharon who took out some twigs from her bag and attached a rope onto it. After rolling it to Hawk he grabbed a nearby tinfoil ball and pulled the rope back sending the ball smacking into Flora in the face.

	While Flora bent back covering her now bleeding eye the woman seemed genuinely impressed and patted the boy on the back. Flora cracked her neck before saying ‚ÄúGood stuff‚Äù. Hawk  nodded before Belle ruffled his hair with her hand as if she was an ‚Äúolder sister applauding their younger sibling‚Äù. As the night stars continued to litter the sky Flora  and Sharon and Belle went to bed but Hawk wanted to stay up and watch the stars. Sharon claimed she wanted to do this too, resulting in Flora to still shut her carriage door. The couches were soon moved into seats that one would see at a movie theater with the train soon extending out. The ceiling opened as Belle had more of a down to earth conversation with her tributes asking them what she should name her 4th child which was a boy which she was currently pregnant with. The two tributes bounce ideas off of each other till Belle was impressed when Sharon mentioned naming him ‚ÄúMatthew‚Äù. As Sharon began to doze off Belle looked at Hawk who was mesmerized with the glittering stars. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre pretty aren't they‚Äù. However she heard soft snoring followed as Belle looked seeing a Hawk resting on her shoulder. The girl softened before the train was bumped back to being normal as Belle picked up both Hawk and Sharon putting them in their respective carriages and returning to her own sleeping for the remainder of the night.


	The next day Belle awoke her tributes early with some hot cocoa and apple cider donuts and eggs. Flora noticed they were nearing the captial and after looking at what Hawk was wearing a tank top  cream shirt and shorts while Sharon wore a long brown nightgown.  Belle shrugged before taking out some colorful string called yarn and begun knitting while Flora conversed with Sharon on the current reapings with the two laughing hysterically at the reapings of Drew and Peter and Amelia(12) with Drew missing a right arm Peter a left arm and Amelia her right arm with Sharon calling them ‚Äúthe pointer siblings‚Äù.

Hawk curiously watched Belle knit and asked if he could learn how to knit a shawl since his mother always made him when he was younger. Belle smiled and did this giving him blue yarn and gray yarn spending the remainder of the trip.

When the pair from 7 arrived in the captial moments later Flora and Belle grinned before reading their tributes. Once leaving there was relatively a small crowd for the 7s which relieved the two from 7. Many ladies gawked over Hawk's eyes, comparing him to Yugi Hashimoto (victor of the 120th hunger games). The boy semmented a good popularity by teaching  his female fans acrobatic movements such as a barrel roll and cartwheels which tired out the captial citizens but many of them cheered further and begged Hawk to do more. He gave Belle a worried look before she encouraged him to do it. Hawk soon climbed  up two polls even doing a parkour stunt by jumping off statues and even a small captial vila. He nearly had a near miss when he fell off of a larger building however a burly man with green hair caught him. Cheers still followed  with sharoon soon challenging Hawk to a parkour race. While Belle was now chatting with fellow associates Flora loudly chanted for this race to happen resulting in round 2 of the parkour to happen. The two tied which caused further cheers to follow and after a photo session with more captial lights Belle and Flora thanked the captial for their time before ushering their tributes to limo. 

After arriving Flora and Belle slapped their faces in embarrassment seeing Ivy Breen, their stylist for 20 years, sat there with a grin. Ivy laughed before hugging Belle commenting on how pleased she was not seeing Carine Janseion the former capital mentor for district 7. She soon brought out a skinny boy that was Sharon‚Äôs age.  She announced this boy to be 19 year old  Rome Heavensbee, the son of former game maker Asreil Heavensbee  . As Ivy announced she was retiring soon walking out of the apartment with Flora taking a sip of wine as  victory. Rome warmly introduced himself to the 4 of them telling Flora and Belle saying how he hoped to make ‚Äúglorious trees bloom‚Äù.

Sharon laughed hysterically at seeing  Rome's rather ‚Äúeccentric‚Äù look as the boy had a purple dress that could switch into a normal looking jumpsuit with a tap of a button. What really made Flora laugh as well was the white makeup on Romes‚Äôs face that made him resemble a dead squirrel. As  Rome asked what was so funny Sharon replied in a thick Scottish tone as Flora‚Äôs accent ‚ÄúNo offense dearie you're absolutely stunning your makeup made me remember the district mayor's son running afterhours drag queen competition in district 7 that turned tumbler‚Äù. Hawk Belle Flora and even Rome who thankfully understood the joke cackle hysterically.

Rome proceed to show Flora and Belle ideas on potential designs but the two ladies decided on a gnome inspired outfits with Hawk wearing a kilt with red and white dots with his beige hair being neatly  combed like a mop and above the kilt he wore a white dress shirt with brown buttons and straps that clicked onto the kilt acting as ‚ÄúBody backpack‚Äù. And with Sharon after Rome‚Äôs stylist aids finished her measurements they made her a red and white polkadot dress and put a mushroom cap on her head to top it off. Flora could not contain her laughter at the absurdity of these outfits with Belle shrugging and saying ‚Äúit's worth a shot‚Äù.  As they had time left the pair from 7 and their mentors watched captial tv until the mentors became interested at the reapings in district  11 taking place.

	As the forestry scenery of 11 came into view the 4 watched with intrigue as the female tribute was about to be announced. 16 year old Carissa Dow was announced as the female tribute for the district. Cameras went to a young lady with shaggy brown afro brown skin wearing a fashionable green dress. Nancy announced to the audience of how the Dow family was the cousins of the once infamous and degenerate family called the Armstrongs that supplied Devin Amrstrong from the 101st hunger games and Devin‚Äôs sister Naomi Armstrong tribute of the 104th hunger games who during the victor of those games Aj Carnival Naomi attempted to flee like an ‚Äúescaped convict‚Äù.  Thankfully the only other problem child in that family Lee Armstrong the tribute of the 114th hunger games gave  the districts 2nd capitol mentor Gale Dovecote probable cause to quit being the mentor to the district. 

Once Carrisa‚Äôs name was called the peacekeepers standing by the newly elected Mayor Wulfric applauded as 8 peacekeepers walked past the girl who had a relatively calm expression on her face. Nancy also  added on to her statement about Carisa stating ‚Äúeven though the family hasn't been too problematic thank those peacekeepers for keeping a good eye on them‚Äù. When Carrisa boarded the stage she rolled her eyes and saw Veronica‚Äôs previously un torn ruby dress. Still the fruit picker shook her hand with grace.


Veronica praised her for maturity before walking over to the male reaping bowl first. However the once matury standing in the current reaping soon evaporated in thin air when Veronica called the name of one 12 year old Dolhobus Mavery. An ungodly screech followed from a wee lad with a shaved head and dark skin fashioning a suit that was dubbed to make him look no older than his actual age. Dolhobus screamed and cried for his father who was held back. However a boy 2 years older walked by from the middle of the crowd and when he boarded the stage Veronica grinned and said ‚ÄúOh darling even if you try to be a hero play those cards right‚Äù. Followed by laughs from citizens in the captial with Cyrus mocking the boy for his ‚Äúdum courage that wouldn't get him anywhere.‚Äù

 The boy had short curls of red hair which was a very rare situation for citizens of district 11 to have also having brown skin with a mix of beige green eyes and an athletic build before snatching the microphone right out of Veronica‚Äôs hands. Veronica screamed ‚ÄúGive that back rat boy it's mine‚Äù. Reluctantly listening to orders Veronica announced that there was a volunteer before telling the boy to introduce himself. 14 year old Fabian Levacri announced himself as the male tribute before promptly shaking Veronica and Carrissa‚Äôs hands with diligence. After taking his spot Veronica announced Carissa Dow and Fabian Levarci of district 11 as this year's tributes followed. No applause followed besides the front of ‚Äúdistrict degenerates‚Äù holding their middle fingers up. However when guns were shot they stopped as Carissa and Fabian were driven to the hall of justice while Veronica and her entourage from the captial and from district 1 made their journey to district 14 main square which was moved to Osaka Japan.

After being brought into their domicile rooms to a waiting family Carrisa sat alone in her room until a man by the name of Runcorn Champagne arrived. Until the events of the 139th hunger games which occured 7 years later Runcorn was a captial teacher sent to district 11 after the events off the 104th games he was sent to the district to ‚Äúorient‚Äù the most rebellious youths. Carissa  asked who the man was before Runcorn smirked saying ‚ÄúThey didn't want to see you, they thought you died.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's fibbery i'm not dead, I had to do that to get away from the mayor nephew‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou did, did you?‚Äù The audience became intrigued hearing this as Runcorn acted similar to a training master of a carrer training academy to Carisa which greatly bewildered her and captial lights.

As for Fabian he was not visited by anybody besides one person.  His boss  Chymera Derine visited the boy. Fabian sat there expressionless but Chimera encouraged the boy to ‚ÄúPut his best foot forward‚Äù. Still without a word he blinked, Chymera reminded the boy that he would have to talk in the captial. Fabian said he was sorry before walking out of his domicile meeting Carissa as the pair from 11 began their journey to the captial. When they boarded the train Carrisa laughed seeing Fabians lost expression before looking in intrigue at the intercetonly placed foods on the dining table.

Fabian gasped with delight seeing the large chocolate bar  screaming ‚Äúdid someone say CHOCOLATE!‚Äù  However  after he took one bite out of the chocolate bar Fabian vomited seeing bugs crawling out the bar and while he ran to the nearby toilet. Carrisa rolled her eyes before soon groaning in annoyance when the table of food soon disappeared.


‚ÄúI pray you have a brain love‚Äù.


	Carissa sprung around fist at bay but the pairs capitol mentor for the ladies Veruca Hilton caught the fist before replying ‚ÄúPut it down like the fire though‚Äù.  As she reluctantly did this another voice followed ‚ÄúThat other one seems dumb even from here‚Äù. As Nick Arden (Victor of the130th hunger games) strolled in he knocked on the ‚ÄúVomit bathroom‚Äù door with him replying ‚ÄúCome on boy I have tylenol.‚Äù

		As Fabian walked back with a nauseated look Nick laughed before kicking him in the stomach saying in a mocking tone ‚Äúcongratulations you're the first out of this year's hunger games‚Äù. Fabian held his knee in pain as Veruca ordered the pair to listen up. She stated that she and Nick will be mentoring differently this year. Carissa became confused with Fabian calling bull.


Nick claimed this year ‚Äúit's up to you‚Äù. Interesting sounds of intrigue and confusion followed in the captial with Cyrus claiming it was indeed a ‚Äúweird thing‚Äù even for a mentor to do. Carissa laughed after hearing this, calling Nick a ‚Äúwaste of a mentor‚Äù. While Veruca was chatting with other peacekeepers toward the bar carriage Nick laughed before saying ‚Äú you two have 4 days to (win us over any mess ups no advice )at the end of the day Veruca and I will calculate your performances so main thing is don't make the stupid agricultural district more hated like the dirty 12s‚Äù

Fabian begged for Nick to come back but he turned back with a grin he replied ‚ÄúMan up kid‚Äù. Before going to Veruca in the bar carriage. Carissa told Fabian to ‚ÄúStop bitching‚Äù she then went on about how for a boy his age she was impressed that he volunteered. Fabian smiled and claimed he ‚Äúfigured to do something heroic for once in his life‚Äù.

Carissa laughed and said ‚Äúsomething heroic?‚Äù. Fabian laughed and said ‚Äúyeah‚Äù. The two soon tried to tinker with the tv to see the other reapings but it only made the projection of the post reaping commentators  Nancy and Cyrus‚Äôs faces to become distorted. Even as an avox tried to help a peacekeeper was ordered to drag the avox out. Fabian got annoyed at this saying and allowed ‚Äúit's just trying to help us‚Äù. 

More on the manner Carissa found a button which brought out a new tv and food that was not moldy.  For the next few hours the pair ate in silence before Fabian broke the silence by trying to articulate a plan to  get their mentors attention but Carrisa stopped him telling him to  ‚Äújust accept the fact they might not have a mentor‚Äù.

Fabian continued to protest but Carrisa pointed at Nick and Veruca crossing a line through their notes. The 14 year old grew angry and stormed through the bar carriage. Only seeing the 2 peacekeepers Nick and Veruca chatting. All hell soon broke loose when Fabian lunged at Nick breaking his gray glasses screaming ‚ÄúASSHOLE WE JUST WANT TO TRY TO GET OUT LIKE YOU CAPTIAL LAP DOG POPULAR BLUEBELL JANSEN WANNA BE BIT‚Äù however just before he finished the syllable Nick left hooked Fabian in the face as the 19 year old mentor put his mentey in a choke hold until a bullet was fired. As Fabian fell to the ground in pain Nick soon noticed the rogue  peacekeeper who fired the bullet trying to flee. But Nick and chief train garud  Lanvil restrained the peacekeeper, shooting the garud 4 times in the head before tossing the garud in the middle of district 10s  desert. As unfortunately Fabian died from the bullet wound an emergency meeting followed after  Fabian unfortunately lost his life it was declared another speed reaping would take place. Carissa was rather confused as the train made a detour back to district 11. In district 11 a ‚Äúspeed train‚Äù was docked at the hall of justice as Carissa and Veruca and Nick made their way to the speed train while Mayor Hill looked dully at the depressed male youths refusing to even look up at Mayor Hill.

Still he chose the new male tribute for district 11 that being 17 year old  Rapheal  Pharsi.  A boy with messy brown braids fashioning an stylish emerald green suit with a green ascot. Nancy and Cyrus adored the boy's look and the fact of how he ‚Äúdid not cause a fuss‚Äù like the originally reaped male tribute of the district. Raphael  sighed with despair after hearing his name. Even though others cheered  that they were spared, some patted the boy on the back as he made his way up.

After he shook Mayor Hils hand the youths were dismissed again and Rapheal was quite literally drop kicked into the speed train as the train made its journey back to the captial.  Carissa shook Rapheal‚Äôs hand introducing herself to him saying ‚ÄúThe original boy beat the crap out of your mentor and got shot‚Äù. ‚ÄúLovely‚Äù Rapheal replied. The social experiment both Nick and Veruca had for Carissa and Fabian stopped as Veruca asked the pair who they would want as their mentor. This was a rather easy task as Carrissa chose Veruca and Rapheal shrugged saying ‚ÄúHockey man guess you and me‚Äù. While Veruca and Carissa  more formally conversed Nick beckoned Rapheal over.

The boy was respectively confused at this request but obliged. When the two men were in the weapons carriage Nick told Rapheal to sit. As he obliged Nick turned on the 130th hunger games that he won 2 years prior. WHen asked on what to do Nick bluntly replied ‚ÄúGive me a report on these games and when your done test your skills in weapons a peacekeeper will watch your progress  if you want to leave get 5 bulls eyes or if your not using bows and arrows/knives have a weapon accuracy of 90 or higher.

Rapheal had more questions to ask however Nick soon left the carriage and as the speed train continued speeding on Rapheal ended up tripping. However this did not stop him from doing as was asked. Carissa Veruca asked her a bit about her home life. Carissa claimed how she was ‚ÄúJust a fruit picker‚Äô> Veruca shrugged, asking ‚Äúthat all seems to be a little boring even for an outlying district‚Äù. After hearing Veruca‚Äôs words Carissa claimed ‚ÄúThe field I worked at Panems scummy white color helmet guards made us climb to the top of  these ungodly tall trees like those tree huggers‚Äù. Veruca‚Äôs expression turned  to intrigue replying ‚ÄúYour good with heights that's good‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor a fact I'm afraid of heights‚Äù. Veruca and Snow square laughed with Nancy commending Carissa on ‚ÄúBeing an interesting sight so far‚Äù. To pass the time, Veruca displayed a holographic quiz  that displayed poisonous foods and non poisonous foods.

Veruca watched as Carrisa easily ran through the 80 questions however but swore when she got the final question wrong she threw her flask of water at a wall in rage as an avox was hit by a stray projectile. Veruca hurried to stop her emphasizing she  ‚Äúgot 79/80 correct‚Äù. Carissa still swore in rage but was stopped when Veruca pinched her neck. Carissa apologize for the ‚ÄúOutburst‚Äù, resulting in Veruca shrugging off the incident also keenly reminding the girl to ‚Äúhave less or even none of the outbursts in the captial‚Äù. After hearing a loud bang  the woman soon looked curiously at the men now sparring. The two spent the remainder of the train ride watching this fight.


Eventually the train from 11 finally made its way into Snow station. Nick peeked out of the train window being really surprised seeing no captial lights there waiting for them.  Raphael inquired how ‚Äúafter the death of the mentally absent lad‚Äù they're probably scared out of their mind.  Nick smirked but as the train stopped Veruca realized how late they were.

The 2 from 11 and their captial and district mentor steam rolled their way up to their accommodations with their stylist Anabell Shafer squealing in a panic that she didn't want her first year to be so poor. Veruca did damage control and helped Anabel and the other stylists do measurements while Nick watched with a bemused smirk. Eventually after both the tributes from 11 had a growing disdain for being jossleed around Annabell declared they would be dressed as Gala apples and after quite literally dressing the tributes themselves Annabell rushef them down while Veruca and Nick stayed behind with Nick quietly telling Veruca ‚ÄúThis happens too much‚Äù.

Trust has always been the cornerstone of human interaction, but for centuries we‚Äôve depended on institutions to mediate it. These structures are often slow, exclusionary, and prone to failure. Polkadot, powered by JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine), offers a transformative alternative‚Äîa system where trust is inherent, decentralized, and verifiable.

The promise of decentralization is not speculation or fleeting trends; it is resolving how we connect and  collaborate:

üîì **Trust through verification**: cryptography ensures reliability, removing the need for middlemen and gatekeepers.

üîó **Permissionless interoperability**: applications and chains to integrate seamlessly across industries and borders.

‚ö° **Scalable and adaptive**: Infrastructure that enables mass adoption without sacrificing decentralization or control.

Crypto‚Äôs past has largely been defined by financial experiments, but its future lies in creating tools and systems that underpin a new way of interacting‚Äîsecure, open, and universally accessible. Polkadot and JAM deliver the infrastructure for builders and innovators to go beyond payments and speculation, to create decentralized applications and services that work for everyone.

We‚Äôre not just building technology; we‚Äôre redefining how the world works together. This is a pivotal moment to design systems that empower, include, and inspire. We will deliver an internet that reflects our best ideals: transparent, resilient, and truly for all.

Together, we will build the global computer the world deserves. üíªüåç

**Welcome to the week!** üåê

All discussion is welcome here including conversations about the price of the DOT token, related tokens, markets and economy of the Polkadot crypto economic system.

I kept missing important crypto news because I was too lazy to check multiple sites, so I built a little weekend project that pulls news from different sources into one place. Added AI summaries to help quickly scan articles and included active crypto streams since I watch those too.

The first time you request an article summary it takes a few seconds (AI, you know), but after that it's cached and instant. Nothing fancy overall, but it helps me stay on top of things. Would love to hear if anyone else finds this useful and what features you'd want to see!

Back to Basics: Common Scams to watch out for in 2025,Polkadot,1hso50x,2025-01-03 09:51:21,14,0.95,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1hso50x/back_to_basics_common_scams_to_watch_out_for_in/,Dot_Anti-Scam_Team,,"The crypto space is full of opportunities‚Äîbut unfortunately, where profits exist, so do scammers. From phishing scams to fake tokens and impersonation schemes, bad actors exploit everyday users to make a quick buck. Let‚Äôs explore these common scams and, most importantly, how you can stay safe:

# Phishing Scams

Phishing scams are a type of social engineering where attackers trick users into sharing sensitive information, like wallet details. Here‚Äôs how they work:

1. **Links That Look Legit:** Scammers use links that mimic legitimate sites, often swapping characters like a ‚Äú0‚Äù for an ‚Äúo.‚Äù
2. **Fake Websites:** They may create knock-offs of popular DeFi or crypto platforms, complete with professional-looking designs to fool you.
3. **DM Scams:** Many phishing attempts begin in your DMs, especially on platforms like Discord or X (formerly Twitter).

**How to Stay Safe:**

* Double-check every link before clicking.
* Avoid clicking on links from unknown senders.
* Hover over links to inspect the URL for discrepancies.

# Fake Tokens

Scammers create counterfeit tokens to lure unsuspecting buyers. These tokens often mimic legitimate ones by using similar names and logos. Once they‚Äôve generated hype, they execute a **rug pull**‚Äîdraining the funds and leaving investors high and dry.

**Warning Signs:**

* Over-the-top advertising on social media or through DMs.
* Phishy links or websites promoting the token.
* Promises of sky-high returns that seem too good to be true.

**How to Stay Safe:**

* **DYOR (Do Your Own Research):** Investigate the project thoroughly before investing.
* Check community sentiment; while not always accurate, widespread concerns can be a red flag.
* Be skeptical of any project that aggressively pushes you to act fast.

# Impersonation Scams

These scams involve attackers posing as influencers, developers, or trusted figures in the crypto space. The goal? To trick you into trusting their recommendations‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs buying a token or clicking a phishing link.

**Tactics Used:**

* Highly convincing profiles with stolen photos, fake followers, and detailed bios.
* Urgency tactics to pressure you into quick decisions.

**How to Stay Safe:**

* Verify the identity of anyone reaching out to you. Compare usernames and check official channels for confirmation.
* Be cautious with direct messages‚Äîmost legitimate figures won‚Äôt DM you unsolicited.
* Remember: If it feels off, it probably is.

# Final Tips for Staying Safe in Crypto

Navigating the crypto world requires vigilance. Phishing attempts, fake tokens, and impersonation schemes are just the beginning. Always:

* Take time to verify before acting.
* Be wary of opportunities that seem too good to be true.
* Stay informed‚Äîknowledge is your best defense against scammers.

In crypto, a few extra minutes of caution can save you from massive losses. Keep your guard up and stay safe out there!

What is the minimum DOT required to receive staking rewards with ledger?,Polkadot,1hsks98,2025-01-03 06:50:35,16,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1hsks98/what_is_the_minimum_dot_required_to_receive/,vonvinvoo,,"I understand the minimum DOT required to bond for solo nominations is 250, but I always thought that even though you could pass the minimum of 250 to stake, you needed to have around 500 DOT to regularly receive rewards due to the way staking works.

However it has been a while, and i've just checked [https://staking.polkadot.cloud/#/nominate](https://staking.polkadot.cloud/#/nominate) where it says minimum required to earn rewards is 237.07. Is this a misleading figure, or has something changed over the past 6 months whereby now if you stake from ledger with 250 DOT you will regularly receive rewards?

I am asking now as after a long time of being unbonded I decided to use Talisman wallet paired with ledger as I have been aware for quite some time you can join a pool with said wallet and continue to received rewards.

Is there any gain or loss between staking with Talisman wallet vs staking yourself through ledger nominations?"

"Its time for the its time for the theory, its time, its time for its time for the, its time for the is a awesome show, yes indeed, wow, awesome, its time fo-",GameTheorists,1hqkkl2,2024-12-31 13:17:10,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/comments/1hqkkl2/its_time_for_the_its_time_for_the_theory_its_time/,Itz_Gloinky,GT Theory Suggestion,"There is a show on YouTube, inspired by the popular show genera called object shows started by Battle for Dream Island (which should also receive a theory sometime eventually) and uses the repetitive format of object shows and flips it on its head, a sub genera in the object show community is called joke shows, making a mockery of the repetitiveness generic object shows have, by doing just that, but ironically. but another kind of joke shows is those that show what do do right, while still making ironic parts, but this one focuses on story, plot, and a theorists favorite thing, you know it, you love it, LOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, the show begins as just another object show, trying to get a quick buck off the ever growing format of object shows, but it quickly shows that to not be the case, if you are going to watch this show you may want to know what an object show is, an object show is a show where different characters compete for a prize, but they are all living objects, this is because humans are hard to animate. This show is a joke show that focuses on what to do right, while poking fun at the generic shows. and this show is an example, with the story, plot, LOREEEE, and characters being compelling. (MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE AFTER CREDIT SCENES)

In the show, we constantly see the number 57, and there is a reason for this which hints at itself in the show. but this is still a theory, but i, AND MANY OTHERS, believe that the show takes place in a tv, one of the ones without streaming services, just channels. the show takes place on channel 57 Even one of the characters, words for friends tile, comments on the fact, ""man, i see 57 once and i feel like im seeing it everywhere"" Above everything in the world, we see text that says ""CH 57"" as seen the 5th episode, titled ""Fifty-Seven Tears Of The Star"" although it is slanted and hard to read.

So. On the channel where this show is hosted, The channel ""Derpadon,"" there was another show on the channel, more like a typical object show, which for those uneducated about these shows and how they work, which I just realised I never explained in ANY of my messages, object shows have the format of shows like total drama and survivor... sometimes, they don't ALWAYS follow this format, some of them, like HFJONE, have competition and lore, and others, like The Nightly Manor, just have lore.

The main thing that sets object shows apart is that everyone, sometimes excluding a few people, are living objects. The reason the creators of the first object show did this is because they couldn't draw humans. To be fair neither can I.

Now, back to ITFT, and how Derpadon's old show fits into the lore. The old show was titled ""Race for the Keys"" following a more traditional format of object shows, with the prize being a keyboard able to do anything. This show has been canceled and I don't want to rewatch the 8 episodes to find out if the lore here has been planned since all the way since the show started. But, rftk isn't the focus here and now. It's something derpadon has called in the title of the playlist ""CH 547""

You see. In the previous theories I have stated that it's clear that ITFT takes place in a channel on a TV station in universe. The TV station is called ""Jasonville TV"" and you will never guess what the town I think it's in is called (SARCASM) But what I have realised, is that due to the shorts in ""CH 547,"" I think RFTK also takes place in a channel on Jasonville TV Let's analyze the first video in the playlist. This video celebrating 2 years of the show.

The video begins with the date this is taking place in, in universe. June 28th 2022. And then shows 2 of the characters from RFTK, which is what makes it obvious that they are apart of Jasonville TV, they are just interacting like normal, and more characters from RFTK shows up to. But this is not in the normal environment the show, RFTK, takes place in. I didn't notice much actually happening in this though, at least not progressing the lore.

The next video is literally just the characters from RFTK singing all I want for Christmas as a Christmas special, as this video was posted on Christmas Eve. Also this video made me realize there are so many people in this show that cant talk.

The next video is the first one made after the creation of the main focus, ITFT. Specifically made after episode 6, titled ""Will you ever know?"" But before episode 7, titled ""Stop and look. Realize""

Looking at the thumbnail I already see something. All the ITFT episodes have a clock in the bottom left of the thumbnail, and as I said, the show in universe takes place in a day, with episode 1 at 1 PM, episode 2 at 2 PM, so on, and the clock shows the time the episode takes place. The CH 547 shorts after itft was made do also have the clock, and it shows the right time, but the clock is shattered.

I feel like now I should talk about the most important character in the Derpadon Cinematic Universe. Polkadot. Polkadot most of the time, is a square with little Polkadot's on it, but she can also... become the Polkadot? I'm not completely sure but she just becomes a bunch of floating colorful dots. The dots of which leads anyone who enters to different channels, but I'm not sure she realises until later and she (Polkadot) just sees them as portals.

In episode 4, titled ""Do NOT use the popcorn button"" a portal, with Polkadots just like Polkadot, appears. And it shoots out random objects, seemingly props for the shows on Jasonville TV. But starting episode 5, ""Fifty-Seven Tears Of The Star,"" it also shoots out individuals.

Back to the CH 547 stuff, in the 3rd video of the playlist, titled ITFT \[6:31\] we see both people from ITFT and RFTK, Clock is here also, and asks people people to ""Deliver a package to Texas,"" this video is as promotional material for people to buy the ITFT DVD'S at the Object Show Community Meetup in Texas. I'm not sure if this video is cannon, it could be because all the others are seemingly cannon, but it also can't be because it disproves a theory that has loads of evidence.

this theory is what i call the algrbrailized clock.

in object shows, objects are not the only species, there are also beings called ""algrabrailians"" of which autocorrect loves to call Brazilians.

Algrabrailians are living symbols, although sometimes objects, with the major difference being more bulky limbs, and most of the time way more strange (personality wise) and powerful.

In the after credits scene of many episodes in the main ITFT series, we see clock, but not as a algrabrailian, but as a object, it paints a simple scene, clock cooks popcorn, he sits on the couch, watches tv, dazes off, and suddenly he is jolted awake.

he looks at the tv and sees ITFT playing in the background with algrabrailian clock's silhouette.  clock is shocked by this, runs outside, and sees a bright light. also to note that there is something falling from the sky in the scene here and many beleive it is wheel, after falling into the void in a secret video found using spectrograms, decoders, and codes in the video, this is the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y\_WUJ4Nz0u0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_WUJ4Nz0u0)

the title for the next video in the playlist is ""IT'S TIME FOR THE \[6:58\] - In The Past"" It's fair to assume these videos were taking place before the 2 shows, ITFT amd RFTK.

The video starts with people from RFTK and ITFT playing a card game. And there are also some people we havnt seen, presumably they are in the other jasonville channels. Clock shows up to. Which makes me realise that the previous video really was cannon and i have no explanation. None. I don't know. Help. Anyway. Clock seems to assign random jobs to people here on channel 547. Something confusing happens, Lock, a character from RFTK, who cant talk, apparently was able to talk in the past??? Maybe they got injured which caused them to lose their voice. Clock assigns Marmalade, (someone who we didn't see until now in this Cinematic Universe, probably from another jasonville channel) to get a gift box for Lock to deliver, this box shows up in ITFT 7. Marmalade peeks inside the box, and there is a polka dot void like the one in itft 5. We will call these voids ""Polka Voids"" Marmalade gets consumed by the Polkavoid. And the PV spreads. My theory is that the PV sends them to the channel we find them in (Example is that it would send Vase to channel 57, which us where ITFT takes place in) and also removes their memories of channel 547. Something further proving that this is in the past is we see end key (the host of RFTK) with the Magic Keyboard (What will be the prize of RFTK) and he is talking about feeling empty, even tho he has a keyboard with unlimited power.

Then, star jar, someone who is nit from CH 57 but shows up in itft later on due to the thing we have discusses multiple times that happens in episode 5 of ITFT. Star jar is a weird person. Being able to accurately tell what is going to happen. She tells End key, and the person he is talking to, 100 Cube, ""we're all going to die soon... just thought I should let you know"" before they get consumed by the void. It then shows characters, some from RFTK, Some from ITFT, and some we don't know, running from the PV (Polka Void) Then, a pink creature shows up, and acts like a normal object show host with something that happens in normal object shows, they ask ""do you want to compete in my competition show"" like a normal object show. Then, after being yelled at by wheel, sees the PK and creates a purple shield of a glass-like material. But it doesn't hold for long. It shatters. And everyone, and everything, gets consumed by the void. Then, the credits roll. That's the end of what is currently released of the series and I'm trying to peice together everything. My main question is how clock is there before itft begins. So I say what I found here and hope we get a film theory.

Friendly reminder that most of the coins in top 100 won't survive the next crash,ethtrader,1hprbhd,2024-12-30 11:42:28,34,0.82,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hprbhd/friendly_reminder_that_most_of_the_coins_in_top/,whodontloveboobs,Trading,"I did some research and compared the current prices of some altcoins/tokens with their prices back in May 2021. The results were a bit of surprising since most of the coins/tokens didn't survived till now. 

I think most people should realize this. Ethereum and Bitcoin are called bluechips for a reason. Most of the altcoins or tokens and some ""ETH killers"" won't survive the next crash. You should invest according to this.

Note: I just shared a few top coins with you. They were one of the most popular coins by market cap back in 2021. I can't even imagine how coins that were out of top 100 are doing now. They probably went extinct like Luna.

\#5 Coin by marketcap back in 2021: Internet Computer was at $464 back in May 2021. It's current price is around $9. That's more than 90% down.

Number 9 coin back in 2021: Polkadot. It was $36 back in 2021. It's current price is $6

Some other coins:  NEO was around $100 back in 2021. Now it's at $13.

Cosmos was $25, not it's $6.

Tezos was $6 back in 2021 may. Now it's trading around $1

Compund (COMP) was at $800, now it trades at $74

Dash was $375. Now it's at $38

Those are the coin I checked randomly. You can check more by yourself as well. Just keep in mind that those coins were all in top 100. There were millions of people who believe in them back in 2021. Now all those coins are down around 90%.

DOT Existential Deposit: Available vs. Staked,Polkadot,1hpqj27,2024-12-30 11:08:21,9,0.92,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1hpqj27/dot_existential_deposit_available_vs_staked/,Eye-Catching,,"My pensioner uncle has bought some DOT and entered a Nomination Pool. He asked me a question that I may have answered myself with some tinkering, but - as it's his question to me - I'd like some backup if it's forthcoming. Appreciate any thoughts or pointers.

I've told him to always keep a modest amount of DOT, over 1, as Available balance due to the Existential Deposit *and* gas requirements. This is an approach I always take myself, leaving about 5 DOT free.

He could not believe it was even theoretically possible for a staked account to be reaped if the Available balance dropped below 1 DOT and I started to mull this - maybe it's me who's been operating under this misconception. It doesn't help that there's certainly different views out there, as I've been reading-up.

And I found that both Talisman and the polkadot.js site will happily get to the approval stage of a 1.64 DOT transfer of a 1.66 DOT Available balance without warning you of any problem. That doesn't mean I've gone and tried to do it - just that I've progressed through the UIs.

The polkadot.js site has the **transfer with keep-alive checks** checked - but I guess that check happens as you execute the transfer. If you uncheck that it certainly implies reaping will happen if you **transfer the full account balance, reap the sender** but it misses the key word of **available** (for me). Obviously he could choose to empty the account of any *available balance* \- but the *true balance* is whatever he has staked, no? Much more than the existential deposit... it's in no way a dust account.

So, if he had 200 DOT in a Nomination Pool, could he empty that account (even of any gas) and not be reaped, or is it for sure that the Existential Deposit doesn't care about the 200 locked away and only the balance that is spendable?

I'm minded to just reply - ""better safe than sorry"" - but I am curious."

Understanding Staking in Crypto,BuildOnWYZth,1hplvhi,2024-12-30 07:07:10,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildOnWYZth/comments/1hplvhi/understanding_staking_in_crypto/,WYZthChain,,"Staking is one of the most popular ways to earn rewards in the crypto world while supporting blockchain networks. If you‚Äôre curious about how it works and why it‚Äôs important, this guide will break it down step by step.

# 1. What Is Staking?

Staking is the process of locking up your cryptocurrency to help maintain and secure a blockchain network. In return, you earn rewards, typically in the form of more cryptocurrency.

Think of it like planting a tree:

* You plant a seed (your crypto).
* The tree grows and strengthens the ecosystem (the blockchain).
* Over time, the tree gives you fruits (rewards).

Staking is used in blockchains that rely on Proof of Stake (PoS) or similar systems to confirm transactions and create new blocks.

# 2. How Does Staking Work?

Here‚Äôs how it works in simple terms:

1. Lock Your Crypto: You commit some of your cryptocurrency as a ‚Äústake.‚Äù
2. Help the Network: Your stake is used to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.
3. Earn Rewards: For your help, the blockchain rewards you with additional cryptocurrency.

# 3. Why Do Blockchains Need Staking?

Staking replaces the older system called Proof of Work (PoW) (used by Bitcoin) that requires powerful computers to solve math problems. Instead of using lots of electricity, Proof of Stake networks rely on staked cryptocurrency to achieve the same goal:

* Verifying transactions.
* Adding new blocks to the chain.
* Keeping the network secure.

Staking is more energy-efficient and faster than mining, making it a better option for modern blockchains.

# 4. What Can You Stake?

Not all cryptocurrencies support staking. Popular ones that do include:

* Ethereum (ETH)
* Cardano (ADA)
* Solana (SOL)
* Polkadot (DOT)
* Tezos (XTZ)
* Wyzth (WYZ)

Each blockchain has its own rules for staking, like how much you need to stake and how rewards are calculated.

# 5. How to Start Staking

Getting started with staking is straightforward:

1. Choose a Blockchain: Pick a cryptocurrency that supports staking.
2. Set Up a Wallet: Use a wallet that allows you to stake your crypto. Some wallets come with built-in staking options.
3. Select a Validator or Platform: On some networks, you can stake directly. On others, you might delegate your stake to a validator or use a platform like Binance, Coinbase, or WyScale.
4. Lock Your Crypto: Decide how much you want to stake and lock it up for a specific period.
5. Earn Rewards: Sit back and watch your rewards grow over time!

# 6. What Are the Benefits of Staking?

* Passive Income: Staking lets you earn more cryptocurrency without trading.
* Supports the Network: By staking, you‚Äôre helping the blockchain remain secure and decentralized.
* Environmentally Friendly: Unlike mining, staking uses minimal energy.
* Increased Community Engagement: Stakers often get a say in blockchain decisions through voting rights.

# 7. What Are the Risks?

While staking has many advantages, it‚Äôs not without risks:

* Lock-Up Periods: Some blockchains require you to lock your crypto for weeks or months. You can‚Äôt withdraw it until the period ends.
* Market Volatility: The value of your staked cryptocurrency can go down, affecting the overall value of your rewards.
* Validator Risks: If you delegate your stake to a validator, their mistakes (like going offline) could reduce your rewards or even cost you part of your stake (called ‚Äúslashing‚Äù).
* Liquidity Issues: During the lock-up period, your staked funds aren‚Äôt liquid and can‚Äôt be used elsewhere.

# 8. Staking Rewards: How Much Can You Earn?

The rewards you earn from staking depend on:

* The Blockchain: Different blockchains offer different reward rates.
* Your Stake: The more you stake, the higher your potential rewards.
* Network Activity: Rewards can vary based on how many people are staking and the total activity on the blockchain.

For example:

* Ethereum offers annual returns of around 5-7%.
* Cardano rewards range between 4-6%.
* Solana can provide 6-8% returns.
* WyScale offers competitive and flexible staking solutions, tailored for beginners and advanced users alike.

# 9. Staking Platforms

If you don‚Äôt want to handle staking directly, you can use platforms that make it easier:

* Centralized Exchanges: Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken offer staking as a service.
* DeFi Platforms: Use decentralized platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, or WyScale for staking.

These platforms often handle the technical details for you, but they might take a small fee from your rewards.

Staking is an exciting way to earn passive income and support blockchain technology at the same time. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an experienced crypto enthusiast, staking offers opportunities to grow your holdings and contribute to a more secure and decentralized future"

Trust has always been the cornerstone of human interaction, but for centuries we‚Äôve depended on institutions to mediate it. These structures are often slow, exclusionary, and prone to failure. Polkadot, powered by JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine), offers a transformative alternative‚Äîa system where trust is inherent, decentralized, and verifiable.

The promise of decentralization is not speculation or fleeting trends; it is resolving how we connect and  collaborate:

üîì **Trust through verification**: cryptography ensures reliability, removing the need for middlemen and gatekeepers.

üîó **Permissionless interoperability**: applications and chains to integrate seamlessly across industries and borders.

‚ö° **Scalable and adaptive**: Infrastructure that enables mass adoption without sacrificing decentralization or control.

Crypto‚Äôs past has largely been defined by financial experiments, but its future lies in creating tools and systems that underpin a new way of interacting‚Äîsecure, open, and universally accessible. Polkadot and JAM deliver the infrastructure for builders and innovators to go beyond payments and speculation, to create decentralized applications and services that work for everyone.

We‚Äôre not just building technology; we‚Äôre redefining how the world works together. This is a pivotal moment to design systems that empower, include, and inspire. We will deliver an internet that reflects our best ideals: transparent, resilient, and truly for all.

Together, we will build the global computer the world deserves. üíªüåç

**Welcome to the week!** üåê
