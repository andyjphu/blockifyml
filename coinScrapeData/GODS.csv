Sci-Fi and VR capsules,whatsthatbook,1i9xha4,2025-01-25 16:25:23,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1i9xha4/scifi_and_vr_capsules/,Greedy-Fruit6924,UNSOLVED,"I read this book over 5 years ago in Germany, so not sure if jt was English or German.

A girl grows up in a village, (I believe was even treated poorly) and is not allowed to leave. Anyone who leaves can never come back. She meets a boy, and falls in love with him, but he questions the rules. They get together, but one night, he disappears. Three years later, the girls mom is trying to marry her away to someone, but she doesn’t want to, still in love with her old boyfriend. One night she spots a drone. She’s not aware of what it is. She decides to leave and find her boyfriend. 

She finds out that the rest of the world is full of technology, and ruled by computers. She meets a man that appears to be live-streaming, he and other citizens are aware of the villages existence. 

She’s off to finding him again, and she finds out that he’s lived I. A VR capsule, that feeds him etc. When she does find exactly him he looks older and malnourished. Players can only leave on their own so she joins the game, but he doesn’t believe she is who she claims to be. 

I forgot the rest, but I believe she got him out, and the book ends on a cliffhanger saying there’s three computer gods, and to revisit the village she needs to stop them or something.

Help would be greatly appreciated I’ve searched for hours. "

With one of our coworkers. 
We were having a get together w people from work at the apartment we just moved into 5 months ago. It somehow turned into a sleep over as they were drinking too. I feel so fucking stupid for practically standing by as I’m watching this unfold. 
Them talking excitedly to each other for what felt like too long prior to what happened, him bringing down the mattress from upstairs so they could sleep in the living room. And she laid on that bed right next to him like that was her spot for the night and that it was completely normal and innocent. While im laying on the couch right next to them thinking am I crazy? Am I making things up? She has never given me a reason not to trust her. my dumbass decided to just sleep on the couch right next to them, because I really believed her when she said she would never cheat on me that she loved me way too much to do that, that it was such a despicable thing. 
And so I pretend to fall asleep. As they did. 
But I had this gut wrenching feeling that I kept trying to dismiss.  I decided to look on the camera that she had installed in the living room a couple weeks ago. A camera that I didn’t really care too have in the living room in the first place. And I pan it over to the bed that all 3 of them are sleeping in, to see that his shirt is now off his arm is draped around her waist and they are kissing each other. My heart felt immediately too heavy for my chest and my blood began to boil at the same time. And for a split second I thought “should I let it play out and see how far it goes”. But why would I do that to myself do I not love myself enough to make myself go through something that might be even worse. the damage was already done. I shot up from the couch and stood over him and told him to get the fuck out. I still regret NOT punching the shit out of him that night. But there’s still time for that, after all I will have to see them at work until god knows when. I’ve never felt that type of pain before and I hate that I have to turn this shit into a lesson so I can move on. It was a love I really thought would never end in such a tragic and revolting way. 

And for anyone out there who’s had a similar experience im so sorry you are not alone. Unfortunately that is one of the most cliche lines we must say to each other. But I sincerely wish to meet someone one day in real life who has gone through the same shit. The suffering of it all feels like too much for one person to handle alone. "

During a routine exam while I was preforming a TPR (temperature, pulse, respiration) I felt a gassy fart brewing and knew that it would be one of those silent but deadly ones. I took a quick peek around the back office to make sure that I was alone before letting it out.

This particular patient was ready for discharge and I was about to bring the dog out to his owner when the DVM walked past (I thought she had gone to lunch) - Stopped abruptly... took one quick sniff of the air and proclaimed, ""OHHH GOD!!!""

Feeling panicked I quickly joined in on her self-proclamation by saying, ""I know right.""

LITERALLY... THE DUMBEST.... THING.... I ...... COULD .... HAVE ..... SAID..

This specific provider actually owned the clinic that I was working out of and decided that the dog needed a bath before we could discharge him to the owner. - No charge, Free Bath -

An unnecessary bath.

Who do you think she asked to bathe that dog?"

There was a pastor named Howard Pittman who had an NDE in 1979 when God told him that he was a doomed lukewarm and that only 3% of humans made it to heaven and 97% ended up in hell.

Even though there are great number of NDE's that are positive about feeling welcomed and loved without judgement and rare number of NDE's are negative and hellish, thinking about that testimony troubles me.

Are there NDE experiencers that can help me and say otherwise?"

I received a text message from a friend this morning that was extremely concerning and out of character. The text read “I love you and I am sorry for the pain I have caused you.” This text was so out of place that my immediate thought was this persons phone had been hacked. My husbands initial read was that this is a goodbye message and that this person may be considering self harm. 

After a few hours of texting with her, we scheduled a call where things quickly got worse. She told me that she had had a spiritual awakening and that she was going to die. We discussed this for a bit - she made comments about sinning, and that she is not deserving of life and that god was going to punish her for this. This information had been given to her by an “entity”. I asked if she was at home or with anyone and thankfully she is with her parents. I asked to speak with her dad and she passed the phone over to him without any protest. 

Speaking with her father, I learned that she had been working under an individual on a research project for her PhD candidacy. This person had, over the course of several months, convinced her that he has some supernatural abilities, including the ability to see in to the future. He provided some vague predictions that had become true, and had convinced her that she was going to die on this coming Tuesday. He has assured me that she is no longer in touch with this person and that she is safe at home. Unfortunately when I brought up that I think she should talk to someone (a therapist, the university, and potentially the police) he was resistant and did not think that they would be able to do anything. 

I now have her fathers direct number to check in, but I am hoping to get some advice about how to show up for her over the next couple of days while she is convinced that she is about to die. I am sincerely concerned that self harm is still a possibility. Do I call her daily to see how she is doing? She seemed completely at peace with what is happening and there is no resistance to speaking with me. Do I give her space and check in on Wednesday after everything was ok and she did not die? Do I keep in contact with her father and continue to suggest that she speak with a professional? 

I want to help but I am afraid that in my effort to help I may do more harm. Any advice would be welcome. "

Every Starter Solo Run! Mankey! Third win in a row! 24/587,pokerogue,1i9xcwq,2025-01-25 16:20:01,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xcwq,Comfortable_Aspect32,Showcase,"Hey everyone! KC here!

Today we talking about Mankey! The well beloved Mankey. He has everything. He's cool af, his PokeRogue special shines are cool af, he has nice egg moves, nice passive... And God look at Annihilape, that mon is crazy cool!

As I said, Mankey has a really good passive, Iron Fist, with a nice egg move to abuse it, Drain Punch, which is one of the best non setup moves in the game for this challenge. It also gets Meteor Mash, also procs Iron First and covers against Fairy Types, Slack Off, which, to be honest, there's no need at all for it, you already heal up Drain Punch, I think another punch move or priority move would be more appropriate in this spot. It's rare egg move, it's a CRAZY one, No Retreat. But, as always, I didn't have it! :) Game just refuses to give me the rare egg moves I may start going for that machine on the gacha lol As abilities, it gets Vital Spirit, which is the one I went with, Anger Point and Defiant (Didn't have it either).

So I'm not going to lose much of your time today, this run was as easy as walking. I run Drain Punch/Fire Punch(TM)/Meteor Mash/Rage Fist, later in the run I got in Thunder Punch taking out Fire Punch, to cover against Flying Types, and much more later, wave 100+, I got Bulk Up which I swapped with Meteor Mash.

Every single fight, it just did what it's name is about, Punching. Punching and 1HKO'ing the opponents, even without booting. When I got Bulk Up and I could boost, it was just a matter of finding the spot for setting up. It was really crucial since Ray was an issue.

Managed to beat Ivy at 145 after boosting a bit, and managed to beat her at 195 after Ray's hurricane miss into Ivy changing him. That's was actually a hard one since she was bringing up Ray first turn, and had to find a way out of there. 

Team Plasma was really easy, making me so happy to obliterate the GMax Copperajah who has been a menace the whole challenge. Elite 4 and champion were also pretty easy.

For Eternatus, I didn't have Confide, Amnesia or No Retreat, so I went the hardcore way. I learned Curse but I didn't use, since I was able to use Bulk Up to +6 because Eternatus was kind of messing around with his attacks, and my lefties were enough to survive. Went with Rage Fist, into second stage, another one, just 1 HP bar left, full HP with Shell Bells and one last Rage Fist to finish the run.

This was a really chill run, appreciate it after some more stressful runs we've been having. This was streamed on Twitch, If you don't wanna miss out, you can follow me [here](https://twitch.tv/ImWorthy13). You can also check the current challenge stats [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y_z7T1z8iPXh7IW348YI3CPLpdVxGvqb9yfBiHhfmzs/edit?usp=drivesdk), where Mankey has gone directly into the Hall of Fame, putting Fighting and Ghost type straight into the top of typings.

Much love, take care and see you soon!"
Why You Should Use a Banishing Spell,occultspells,1i9xcfo,2025-01-25 16:19:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/occultspells/comments/1i9xcfo/why_you_should_use_a_banishing_spell/,swingerlover,," 

Banishing spells are among the very critically essential tools that  one needs in their lives. They are so crucial that they can lead to a  complete change in someone’s life. Simply described, banishing spells  establish a safe environment, a psychically secured bubble around you  that may be guarded by hexagrams, pentagrams, Archangels or other beings  and figures

This spell is still regarded as one of the fundamental practices of  ceremonial magic. This spell is quite helpful for everyone who feels  under some negative attacks feels a lot of negativity around them, or  simply feels some sort of possession. It is ideal for banishing  negativity and cleaning the spiritual space. Banishment spells have been  around since the dawn of time and used often with other spells to  enforce the results, especially love spells.

In several cultures of Paganism, banishing is conducted to eliminate  negative or undesired energy, or in some instances people who can cause  problems in our work or general life. While some cultures view banishing  as a retrogressive practice because of their reasons i.e. like the  saying that it affects the free will of others if your culture has no  bans against such matters, then there is no basis that you can’t  practice a banishing spell. Remember the main aim of a banishing spell  is to eliminate those trying to interfere with your relationship, work  or the smooth running of your life. It is not about harming other  innocent people who may have nothing negative about your life.

There are distinct approaches that can be applied to achieve  successful banishing. Depending on your preference, you will need to  choose one among the available approaches- depending on how satisfied  you are with the varying methods and what you are trying to attain.

**Dealing with the unknown spirits.**

Knowing your enemies presents the easiest way to handle the problems  they are causing in your life. If you are fortunate, you can face the  person you no longer wish to see in your life and let them know that.  They will leave you alone. Nevertheless, this may seem simple said than  done. In some worst scenarios, you may not be aware of the person  causing the problems you are facing. This is where the Banishing spells  come in. Even though you may not know the source of your problems, you  will still get the assistance you deserve.

**Banishing Ritual**

According to experts of magic and life, the worst enemy that can  impact negatively on your life is bad spirits. These can either be cast  by your rivals or you may be the one who invited them. While handling  the spirits cast by your rivals may be somewhat challenging, there is  arguably no other thing you should do apart from dealing with the bad  spirits that you may have attracted into your life.

By now, it should be clear that the things you draw into your life  are nothing but the things you are preoccupied with. In this regard, I  imply that in case you are preoccupied with anxiety, you will draw the  same anxiety into your life. By equal measure, if you are overwhelmed by  a dislike for someone you are destined to draw hatred to your life as  well. If you trust that everyone you find in your everyday life is  anticipating harm you then that is what will possibly occur.

With that in mind, the ideal defense from evil spirits is to make  sure that you guard yourself with joyful situations and joyful people.  Above all, use the banishing spell. Never allow others space to control  the state of your spirit at any instance; God should only have such  right in your life. Allow the energies of the banishing spell to defend  you. Rise every day with the determination that you are safe with the  spell. You should always keep in your mind that you are the boss of your  fate and your life will run as per the way you desire it to.

If you have any doubt that there may be harmful spirits in your life,  your place of work or your relationship, it is time to act. The  Banishing spell will eliminate them and allow you to live a free life. I  have had many people casting away the most dangerous spirits in their  lives by utilizing these spells. Note that it is preferable to protect  yourself with the banish spells rather than to wait for something to  befall you to act.

Does ‘Elohim’ in Genesis Refer to God—or a Pantheon of ‘Powerful Ones’,theology,1i9xc84,2025-01-25 16:19:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/theology/comments/1i9xc84/does_elohim_in_genesis_refer_to_godor_a_pantheon/,bohemianmermaiden,,"

I’ve been exploring some fascinating interpretations of the Old Testament, particularly Genesis, and I’m curious to hear thoughts from this community. Authors like Paul Wallis (The Scars of Eden) and Mauro Biglino (a former Vatican translator and author of The Bible Doesn’t Say What You Think) propose that the term “Elohim,” often translated as “God” in Genesis, doesn’t refer to a singular divine being but instead translates to “the powerful ones”—a plural noun. They argue that this points to a group of beings rather than the monotheistic God of later traditions. Wallis, for example, associates this plurality with what some might call the Anunnaki, beings from Sumerian mythology who were described as creators and rulers.

Biglino, in particular, goes deep into the Hebrew text, claiming that traditional theological interpretations often overlook or suppress the plain meaning of the original words. He highlights how the term “Elohim” is used in contexts that suggest physicality, presence, and even a hierarchical group rather than an omniscient, omnipresent deity. For instance, in Genesis 1:26, the famous line “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” raises questions: Who is “us”? Why the plurality, if this is meant to be a singular God? The common Christian explanation is that this refers to the Trinity, but Wallis and Biglino challenge this interpretation, arguing that the Trinity is a much later theological construct, not reflective of the original Hebrew worldview.

Another intriguing point they raise is how the Elohim interact with humans in ways that seem remarkably physical and localized—for instance, walking in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:8) or directly appearing to figures like Abraham. These depictions feel less like the transcendent God described in later theology and more like beings operating within the constraints of the physical world.

I’m also struck by how Wallis connects this idea to other ancient traditions, particularly the Sumerian texts about the Anunnaki. He suggests that the Bible might reflect a version of these stories, with the Elohim being interpreted as “the powerful ones” or advanced beings who influenced early humanity. This interpretation, he claims, could resolve the tension between Genesis’s depiction of a plural Elohim and the monotheistic God of later scripture.

Biglino also points to specific words in the Hebrew text that challenge traditional translations. For instance, he argues that ruach Elohim (commonly translated as “Spirit of God” in Genesis 1:2) might instead refer to a literal “wind” or “breath” of the powerful ones, with no divine implication. Similarly, the phrase “create” (Hebrew bara) may not necessarily mean creation from nothing (ex nihilo) but instead imply organizing or shaping something pre-existing.

I’m not saying I fully agree with their conclusions, but these interpretations are thought-provoking. They challenge deeply ingrained assumptions about the text and raise questions about how much later theology has shaped our understanding of these early writings.

What do you think of these arguments? Do you find Wallis and Biglino’s interpretations compelling, or do you see flaws in their approach to the Hebrew text and ancient context? I’d also love to hear from anyone who has studied the original Hebrew—how should we understand terms like Elohim, bara, or ruach Elohim in their proper context? And how do we reconcile the plurality in Genesis with monotheistic tradition?"

Anyone Finding Motivation Difficult,uberdrivers,1i9xc7c,2025-01-25 16:19:11,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/1i9xc7c/anyone_finding_motivation_difficult/,davidg910,,"I do this as a side gig. January is a slow month in my market, it's colder outside, the quests/boosts are gone again in my market, there's VERY little surges, and minimum fare has went back close to at its worst.

I just find it very hard to have the motivation to do this nowadays. I go out there, work my butt off for tips, but there's very minimal fares that fit my criteria to accept and I end up having to decide whether I'm going to just take some bad trips to any form of money or just call it. I find that it's hard to even get myself to turn on the app and see what's out there, knowing in the back of my mind that I'm running my car into the ground and not getting too much out of it.

  
I started driving for Uber approaching two years ago, I'm between 1500 and 2000 rides. When I started, things weren't great, but things felt a lot better than they are now. Maybe things will pick up in the spring, the past couple springs have been nice, but it feels like Uber has really dropped the ball in terms of treating us drivers with respect.

I don't think I'm asking for much. Give me some form of quest, even if it's 20 bucks for 30 trips, give my weekend surges, raise that minimum fare to at least $4.50 or, God forbid, $5 so I can feel like I have some more dignity driving. I don't think that would bankrupt the business."
"Running CoS for the first time, planning my stacked Tarokka reading.",CurseofStrahd,1i9xc29,2025-01-25 16:19:02,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/1i9xc29/running_cos_for_the_first_time_planning_my/,TenWildBadgers,REQUEST FOR HELP / FEEDBACK,"I've already heard lots of people recommending that you not randomize the Tarokka reading, and I wanted to get the opinions of people who've done it before on the set I'm currently planning to run. I admittedly am still in the process of reading the book cover-to-cover, so this is a first draft, but I figure it's reasonable to ask advice now on specific topics.

1: 7 of Swords, Tome of Strahd goes in the faceless god's head in the Amber Temple, probably in that Arcanaloth's possession, now that I think about it.

I figure I want something to be out in the Amber Temple, and having the place tied to Strahd's backstory reveal more of Strahd's backstory feels like a good fit. The only more natural place I could think of for the book is with the witch in Berez.

2: 1 of Glyphs, the Amulet of Ravenkind behind the sun emblem in the Abbey of St. Markovia

I knew I wanted something in the Abbey as well, and a holy symbol in a fallen holy place feels naturalistic. If my goal is a balance of making the items feel like they have a reason to be where they are, and spreading them out across the map, then it fits.

3: 1 of Swords, the Sunblade is in Vladimir Hornguard's possession

Again, reasonably spread out across the map, and the idea of modifying Hornguard's statblock so he attacks them *with the sunblade* just sounds like fun.

I'm a little disappointed that I didn't find an item to give to Baba Lysaga over in Berez, but with the goal of spreading items across the map, since Berez is right next to Argynvolstholt, I figured it was one or the other, and giving Hornguard the sunblade was too fun an opportunity to pass up.

4: The Horseman, their ally is Arrigal, though I'm not going to tell them his name upfront

I'm not going to be against them picking up other allies for short periods, or being able to rally a small army to storm Castle Ravenloft if they play their cards right, but looking over the list, Arrigal felt the most interesting, and the most like someone who would never help them otherwise, and getting Strahd's servants to betray him, then be betrayed in turn just sounds like a fun path for the adventure.

5: Undecided.

I don't feel like I've read enough about Castle Ravenloft yet to know what makes for a good location for the final duel. My first instinct was the Study, since it's deep enough in the castle that they have to explore the place a bit looking for it, and it feels like it makes sense for Strahd to be there, but part of me likes the vibes of fighting him somewhere down in the Crypts, even if I don't have a solid reason why Strahd is down there off the top of my head. Definitely looking for recommendations on this one.

What do people with more experience with the module think of these choices? Knowing my group, I'm trying to reward them for exploring the width and breadth of Barovia and engage with the place, because I think that's what they'll want to do and enjoy, but I also don't want them to feel like an important item was shoved off into a weird corner for no coherent reason other than ""The Cards said so."""

Is anyone else here afraid to tell some friends and family members that they are atheist?,atheism,1i9xb9d,2025-01-25 16:18:02,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1i9xb9d/is_anyone_else_here_afraid_to_tell_some_friends/,Status-Slip9801,,"For context, I live in the southeastern US, but I'm a first-generation immigrant from a nation with a strong Christian national identity (to the point where everyone is considered to be Christian by default, if they consider themselves to be this ethnicity).

My entire family grew up \*technically\* Christian (we go to church and say the prayers) but my parents didn't make a huge deal about it at home. I have several friends and family members who are quite devout Christians. I don't resent this at all, they are all loving, kind people who are there for me and care for others around them. They do most things ""to the glory of God,"" and when I'm having dinner with them, out somewhere, or at holidays, there is always prayer involved.

I grew up believing the fundamentalist teachings of evangelical Christianity that I was basically indoctrinated into, but I've been atheist for over a decade. I've never told \*any\* of my family members, or any of my close Christian friends, that I do not believe anything about the divinity of Jesus or that anything in the Bible should be taken literally. I have several reasons; I genuinely fear that they would be terrified for my ""eternal soul"" and genuinely waste their mental bandwidth trying to convince me of the error of my ways. I never discuss religion or God with them; if they try to pray I close my eyes and follow along for the hell of it.

I genuinely think that I'm as likely to convince a single one of my friends and family members that everything they've been indoctrinated into their entire lives is a lie, as I am to convince Donald Trump to convert to Islam. So basically, my justification is that I value my relationship with them over their knowing that I don't believe in the religion I was raised in.

So for you all who were raised in religious households or have religious friends, how do you handle these beliefs?"

"An interpretation of Pet Sounds as told from the perspective of a main character, on a psychedelic trip, reflecting on major events in his life up to this point, and understanding deep realizations about the world, himself, and adulthood.",thebeachboys,1i9xali,2025-01-25 16:17:12,6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebeachboys/comments/1i9xali/an_interpretation_of_pet_sounds_as_told_from_the/,myxomatosiac,,"I have been listening to Pet Sounds since 2008. This morning I went on a walk outside, and just happen to pick up on the use of certain unorthodox words in the lyrics, for a pop album. For example, 'You Still Believe In Me' employs words such as 'aware', 'patient', 'faithfully', and of course, 'believe'. These are very strange words to use on a pop album, especially in the mid 1960s. I then reflected, when do people generally use these words? Perhaps during solitude, or moments of intense reflection on one's life. Let's put this into context for a 20-something person in the mid-1960s: this reflection may also be complemented under the influence of marijuana or acid. 

We all know the influence of marijuana on Pet Sounds, which Brian has alluded to many times. I took this detail a step further and wondered, maybe perhaps, the whole album is a deep reflection of the main character under the influence of marijuana. The trip starts with the dream-like guitars that are meant to sound like 'harps', clearly: adding to this dream-like / drug-induced notion of something feeling or sounding a certain way that we all know is familiar, but still distant, echo-y and unfamiliar at the same time, very similar to a dream. Throughout the album, we hear moments of actual sounds that are familiar to us in the real world: bicycle bells and horns, unrecognizable murmurs, coke cans, etc., acting as hazy yet brief traces of the real world popping into this dream state. 

But then the psychedelic trip ends, with the sound of dogs, and a passing train, as we are shifted back into reality, permanently. As real as those feelings felt during the 38-minute trip, they only exist in that dream. All that music, unreal harmonies, and complexity are part of that dream, but they no longer exist in the real world. If we want to revisit this dream, we have to take another dose of the 'drug', meaning we'll have to spin the record again. And maybe, we'll come out with a different realization than the first time. And what are the components of this drug? It's timpani, guitars and pianos playing in unison, bass harmonicas, distant organs, a string section, banjos, harpsichords, theremins, wind instruments, temple blocks, vibraphones, ukeleles, french horns, clarinets...and so much more. Pet Sounds is the drug that encompasses all of these ingredients. And all of these ingredients are arranged in a certain way to make these realizations happen. This is why I believe this album teaches us new things the more we hear it. Each new listen is a new dream / trip, leading us to a new or deeper realization. 

The more we play it, the more it transforms from a journey about a main character, to being a journey about us, our own individual lives and experiences, by forcing us to reflect on those deep feelings that lay hidden deep within our subconscious, when we're in the real world. For example, the words 'God Only Knows what I'd be without you' transforms from a pastiche and banal phrase we may say to our partner in the real world, from time to time, into a deep realization of that partner in a way that's so profound it can't help but invoke a stream of tears running down your face. 

And the music is all there to help complement these deep feelings and reflections. And by the end, we are left feeling what the main character feels: the realness of pain, suffering, the reality of the world we live in, and one's own place in it. 

This aspect, I think makes a great case for Pet Sounds perhaps being the greatest psychedelic album, though it may not seem that way on the surface. Try listening to it with this frame of mind, and I'm sure you will come to appreciate it more too!"

Son can't get to potty in time for poop,pottytraining,1i9xa6g,2025-01-25 16:16:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pottytraining/comments/1i9xa6g/son_cant_get_to_potty_in_time_for_poop/,twof907,,"My son (just over 2, 27 months) poos pretty easily and quickly, consistemcy etc is soft but not loose.  We eat really well and hes just always had a sort of fast system.

Despite wanting to quit we have been powering through the oh crap method, hes doing great mostly with pants on but commando as reccomended by book.  He often goes to his potty himself to pee, still needs help with his pants but has only had 1 pants pee in the last 2 days. We are on day 6 block 2ish.

Poop is another story.  Yesterday and half the day before when we went to pants evey time he poos (which is 2-3x a day as he has always been) he SAYS ""bear poop bear poop""! (Bear poop was first poop he identified so he calls most poop bear poop haha).  He has even shuffled towards his little pot but a hair too late.  This morning we got 90% in there but then the next one 90% in his pants.  

We are progressing, but I'm wondering how I can get him there a hair sooner.  He often really doesnt respond well the last few days to prompting and if I ask he will say 'no' 3 min before ""bear poop bear poop"".  If I sit him down he is writhing around like crazy.  After he says bear poo he will let mw sit him down no problem hes not scared of the potty or pooping anymore it seems. He's not recognizing quite in time he seems yo want to.   The book only talks about a play dough poop visual trick for them, but i know my kid and this will for sure lead to him grabbing and squishing his own poop.  Prompting REALLY hasnt worked for poop.  He gets really upset and Im sure then clenches up anyway and then when it comes is urgent so he cant make it, gets upset sometimes, poop everywhere and he seems embarassed/sad.  I am nice to him but do not say it is ok, just remind him to put it in the pot and to get there/tell me sooner.

I do have Singletary as well

As you can see, I'd be trading a 1.03 in 2025. I've ""beefed up"" this team enough to where my 2026 pick would likely (and maybe hopefully) be around 1.03 again. I still have what would likely be two bottom 3 2026 1st rounders too.

So, is 1.03 in back to back years (approximately) worth it for Achane and Tracy, or should I counter with a lower 1st round 2026 pick?"

Plato thanked the gods for his exalted fate

for freedom from chains of being a slave

for freedom from a woman’s lowly state

but I did not choose this flesh, this given form

reduced to womb and vessel, societal norm.

.

to them, my worth is ovaries and bone

a life confined, my body not my own

they build their laws to cage my voice, my role

and shape the world to strip me of control.

.

a woman risks her life to birth a child

yet men decide her fate with values wild

they craft the rules but never feel the pain 

then leave her trapped in such constraint

.

plato thanked the gods, but i do not

in this world, my voice was left to rot

he was free, his words open to be known,

i live in chains, my body not my own

I (20F) was traumatized by my boyfriend's (21M) fraternity and don't know how to move forward,relationship_advice,1i9x7uh,2025-01-25 16:13:49,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9x7uh/i_20f_was_traumatized_by_my_boyfriends_21m/,Scubadubadue,,"My boyfriend and I have been dating half a year or so. Although I've always had strong thoughts about ""frat bros,"" I gave my current boyfriend, Aaron (fake name), a chance because he wasn't off-put by forwardness of wanting a real relationship -- something hard to come by on a small college campus that's mainly greek life. We started dating, and things have been wonderful. I've never been with a man who treats me this incredible. He spoils me, dotes on me, does anything I ask and is very open and honest. Or so I thought. About a month in, his Big, Brady (also ake name) joked about his nicotine addiction. To my knowledge, although I knew he drank, I was upfront at the beginning about how I disliked smoking, so he said he smoked occasionally in high school but it wouldn't be a big deal to eliminate it from his life. Although he had been trying to quit since starting to date me, he had been lying and still smoking vapes from his friends when offered. He promised to never do it again and to be honest, and I believed him, especially because my friends actually liked him and said that he clearly loved me and that addiction is hard to overcome and be honest about.

Another incident a month or two after that was during ""girls night."" He was the honorary ""waiter"" for our alcohol and was more than welcome to have some. Although I'm mostly over it now, it was a horrible night for him that led to him totally blacking out and projectile vomiting into my eyeball, all over my bed, breaking my shower, etc. And during Christmas, he got blackout and spam called me Christmas night. Ater this, he swore he'd start AA if he couldn't learnt o start moderating his alcohol. After that, it's smooth sailing. I'd like to preface that the only issue I've ever had is with his substance use, in which I honestly know that he loves me and treats me well and that he will follow through with his promises.

We roll around to roughly a week ago on his 21st birthday. I give him spectacular gifts and have fun plans for the following day. I hugh him before he's about to go to a bar with his friends to have a max of two drinks at each bar (there's a maximum of 4 bars in this small college town, especially within walking distance). I reach into his pocket and there it is: a vape that he stole from his frat brother. I confront him, and we get into an argument. However, I confirm with he girls that his addiction isn't something worth breaking up over. I feel pretty alright after getting a second opinion that even now, I agree with. He goes to the bars.

Three hours roll by. I ell asleep in his bed. The door suddenly slams open, and here he comes slumping into the room. He immediately knocks over his television, and upon doing so, crushes the 70 dollar vintage train set I got for his birthday. He's stumbling around like a total drunkard. I'm so upset that he'd betray me in this way, but more so about the 70 dollars instantly going to waste. I'm also a little worried because he'd never been that energetically blackout before, if that makes sense. I put on my jacket and whatnot and run out of the room. all of his fraternity brothers are drunk and confused, especially when he runs out in nothing but underwear after me in -8 degree weather. He grabs onto me on the walkway and is just muttering nonsense. The only things I can make out cohesively enough is that he'll ""die without me"" and ""kill himself if I leave him."" I'm terrified and he refuses to let go of me. I start with whispering clamly but he keeps dragging me back toward the entrance. Some of his brothers are watching and laughing. I text his Big almost complete terrified gibberish with only ""please help me"" and ""get him off of me"" being readable. He finally gets off of me and his brothers let him in. I am a sobbing mess and they simply look over me, telling him about ""woah man, you really outdid yourself"" and stuff like that.

I walk home at 3am in terror because I couldn't even see -- I had taken out my contacts or bed and, in a rush, obviously didn't put them back on. I'm scared there might be other drunkards walking around. Two of his brothers contact me to ask if I'm alright and that it's safe for me to come back, knowing that I had a situation that my dorm was currently taken by a visiting graduated friend. I go back, those two brothers out of the 9 that went out are still drunk but are taking care of both me and him and are pissed at his behavior. I end up sleeping in one of their rooms.

I wake up to loud shouting and laughing by four of the people -- one of them being Brady -- about how funny Aaron was last night -- how he received texts from me, but how harmless the situation actually was. I am so mad and angry. Brady hadn't even asked what the situation was or texted to see what happened. He didn't care, quite frankly. Aaron woke up with a hangover, and upon learning about the situation, is super apologetic. He says he'll start AA right away. He does everything right following this incident. However, at this point, I trust that he loves me and will do what he needs to to keep me.

However, I'm still piping mad at the 7 fraternity brothers that did nothing. I'm mad at the four that stood and watched when I could've been assaulted or could've fallen on the ice and got a concussion. I'm mad at the fact that nobody had the common sense to get him to the state of blackout and consider being remotely sober or it. There's so many intricate details to their behavior afterward when sober that just points to them being selfish, stupid, irresponsible pieces of shit -- because frats are supposed to ""put women first"" and ""protect women."" They made light of the situation, even after finding out from Aaron the full details of what had happened. Even when drunk the two brothers that took care of him saw the seriousness of Aaron's and their brother's state and even apologized for a situation that they had no accountability in. One of them hadn't even gone to the bars with Aaron.

Yes, objectively, things did not go as poorly as they could have. I didn't get assaulted. I didn't end up with a concussion or something. But I felt so betrayed when I saw them laughing and watching when I was calling to them for help. I felt so alone and scared. And their behavior when sober makes me hate everyone except the two nice ones hate them with every fiber of my being, especially Brady.

Apparently Brady had kept buying Aaron drinks when Aaron told him to stop. Arron was already blackout, and Brady bought him six more shots and the strongest drink at a bar. He then went to bed instead of dealing with the situation at all, having gotten extremely drunk himself. Brady failed both of us that night, and I hate him for that. He kept making jokes about it the morning after, and Aaron told me that he had made an announcement of his sobriety to the entire fraternity and explained what happened. Only the two nice guys and Aaron took responsibility. to everyone else, it was ""no big deal"" and he was ""being too hard on himself."" Brady especially kept inviting Aaron over to drink afterwards, and even after two asks from Aaron to apologize to me, he refused, saying he would when he ""next saw me in the house."" Aaron had previously said that I would not be over at the house until god knows when. I received a bullshit excuse literally a week after the incident, but it was just full of excuses of why what happened happened. 

I hate that place and I hate 3/4s of the people there (as it's a decently small chapter on this campus). Everytime he mentions having to do something or I think anything frat related, I'm brought back to that night. And Aaron just today understood that it's no longer about ""us."" It's about them.

I genuinely don't know what to do moving forward. I love Aaron so much and I know nothing similar will happen again, but I don't know how to cope with him being close friends with the people that abandoned me that night and I can't even get a real apology out of any of the seven that failed me. Even sober, they're utter pieces of human filth.

It would be unfair to hate something and the people that takes up the majority of his week. With that night, I lost all respect, likenes, trust, and care for the majority of those people and that place for their irresponsibility both during and after that night. I keep having flashbacks and panic attacks that take me back to that night. The only way I could move past it is for him to eliminate the fraternity from his life entirely, which he's willing to do -- but that would be unfair to him, as that's the only people he is close to on this campus. And the fraternity has somehow ""made him a better person"" and given him ""great opportunities,"" even if all he is is surrounded by womanizers, liars, cheats, addicts, and immature, irresponsible fuck faces, in my humble opinion.

It feels like an ultimatum situation, quite frankly. It would be unfair to force him to sever ties (even though I don't understand why he still couldn't be close friends with literally the four good guys in that place) and isolate him by making him quit the fraternity, but it would also be unfair to both of us for me to hate a major part of himself. I know the easy answer is to break up, but I see a rich and happy future with this man. I just don't know how to disconnect him from the fraternity. 

How do we, or simply I, move forward from this?"

What is the Unitarian approach to Mysticism and spirituality?,BiblicalUnitarian,1i9x5c6,2025-01-25 16:10:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BiblicalUnitarian/comments/1i9x5c6/what_is_the_unitarian_approach_to_mysticism_and/,ExistentialWeedian,Question,"I was thinking about this earlier, that I don’t see a whole lot from Unitarians when it comes to their spirituality. Most of the stuff I see posted is academic in nature, which I get because it’s a stance we’re constantly pushed to defend by mainstream Christianity. I myself though am pretty into the mystical side of faith. I enjoy meditation and introspective thought and was curious how others here went about it, if at all? 

It may be taboo but I adore Islamic thought as well, especially writings by the Sufis. Isn’t Sufism technically compatible with Unitarian thought since the oneness of God is held as an absolute. I’m pretty new to Unitarian thinking, so please excuse me if I come off ignorant. I reread the gospels recently, and I’m currently reading them again. I have no idea what happened but it was like my approach to reading them was somehow different than before. 

Like Jesus being God almost became obviously wrong. I thought I may be a Muslim so I read the Quran and some writings of their thinkers, and it was very enlightening.

After reading book one and begrudgingly pushing through book two, I‘m really wondering if it’s worth it to read the third. I‘m finding it extremely hard sometimes to unterstand Diem, her choices and inner dialogs so far have been nothing but dumb and outright hypocrisy! I have so many points to talk about, the major ones that shocked me however were her inability to put two and two together and understand that it wasn’t Luther who trampled the poor mortal boy and even though she was convinced it was him, she kept falling for him and kept flirting and having fun with him which contradicts the Diem we met in Book 1. what really bothered me is that she ( and her mom) share their inability to LET A PERSON SPEAK A WHOLE SENTENCE OF EXPLANATION BEFORE INTERRUPTING THEM!!! Gods I was fuming while reading the challenging and coronation parts! Don’t get me started on her last Fight with her dad! she actually agreed with him in her inner dialogue, that she was being selfish and that the fate of the world relied on her accepting what she is and that (sadly) a mortal had no place for the time being in the council as it made things so much worse! she then goes on a rampage and complains about what he said! 
I have lots and lots of comments on other events and logical continuity and information between the characters but please tell me if the ending is worth it or not..

a life confined, my body not my own

they build their laws to cage my voice, my role

and shape the world to strip me of control.

a woman risks her life to birth a child

yet men decide her fate with values wild

they craft the rules but never feel the pain

I tried everything but nothing worked.,Epilepsy,1i9x3h3,2025-01-25 16:08:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1i9x3h3/i_tried_everything_but_nothing_worked/,AbsoluteWesleyDodds,My Epilepsy Story,"I am 23 years old and have had Photosensitive Epilepsy since I was 11.

When I have a tonic-clonic seizure, I feel the excessive electricity from my brain spreading through the nerves in my body. I feel each of my muscles react to it and the pain throughout my body at the same time is so strong that it doesn't allow me to faint, the pain prevents me from becoming unconscious. I see, feel and understand to a certain extent everything that is happening to me and around me while I have a tonic-clonic seizure. When I fall, I hit objects and surfaces that leave me with bruises and cuts. During the seizure, I run the risk of biting my tongue. Anyone who tries to use force to open my mouth and hold my tongue runs the risk of losing their fingers because I can bite with amplified force.

My first tonic-clonic seizure was in class in 2012. I stood up to throw something in the trash and, halfway there, I fell to the floor. I tried to straighten up and get up while everyone in the room laughed. I started to struggle, foaming at the mouth, banging my forehead non-stop on the iron leg of the girl's chair I liked, urinating involuntarily while sweating all over my body. After the incident, after the cleaning agents dragged me to the coordinator's couch, my teacher instructed the students in my class not to bring up the subject with me. From that day on, my friends were anime and comic book characters.

But after the tonic clonic seizure is over, I come to myself all sweaty and sore as my memory of it gradually fades until only flashes of memory remain. Then all I remember of what I saw during the seizure looks like a fogged-up window during rain, for example. I believe it is my brain trying to protect me from some psychological trauma related to the humiliation of struggling in public in a puddle of one's own piss or feces. Either way, it is impossible to forget the pain.

My relatives call my tonic clonic seizures ""fits"" and ""tantrums."" Religious people say that ""epilepsy is demonic possession"" referring to tonic clonic seizures because in the Bible it is reported that Jesus Christ cured a young epileptic. My family is extremely evangelical, so imagine what it was like to grow up without friends, not even in your own evangelical family and with a majority of illiterates.

God created the human race to be perfect. Everything God creates is perfect. I was born sick as a consequence of the sins of those who came before me and I pay for my own sins, mistakes and bad choices. God is not to blame for anything that happens to me, God does not punish me for other people's mistakes.

It was other people's mistakes that created the genetic possibility for my epilepsy to awaken. What mistakes? I've been asking myself this since I was 11 years old. But it was *my* mistakes that awakened my latent epilepsy. God created the human race perfect, without blemishes, without diseases. Sin is a hereditary genetic disease. That is why man is born predisposed to evil.

The parable of the apple in Eden means that Adam and Eve exchanged serving God for serving themselves, knowing good and evil just like God. The price demanded by what humanity called the Devil millennia later was the world. The Devil is the owner of the world and that is why he offered the world to Jesus Christ in exchange for saving Jesus from suffering on Calvary. ""God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,"" it is written. Jesus Christ begged his Father to spare him from the suffering of Calvary, if possible.

The reward for sin is death because practicing sin goes against the laws of nature and this makes the body sick.

But epilepsy goes far, far beyond these seizures. I have absence seizures that can be defined as brain lag. I forget absolutely EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING, my mind goes completely blank, I don't know who I am or where I am or what I was doing or what I was going to do. My absence seizures last from 10 to 30 seconds. Because of them, I can't be a firefighter, a soldier, or a lifeguard. I can't even drive so as not to put lives at risk in traffic. So I grew up staying at home, only going out to do what was strictly necessary.

Because of this, I have suffered for years with intense pain in my lower back and knees. If I stand for three whole minutes without holding anything, my lower back hurts intensely and my spine immediately starts to curve. My eyes hurt daily, my lungs are weak, my sense of smell is non-functional most of the time, and I feel sharp pains in my heart sometimes, as if someone suddenly stuck a needle in my chest. In addition, my left eye twitches and some parts of my body suddenly go numb.

I survive in a South American communist dictatorship. Despite my illness, I started working at the age of 15 and I never stopped, I never chose or refused work, but until today I have only had manual labor. I have worked as a store clerk, street vendor, street cleaner, beach waiter, bricklayer's assistant, fries fryer at Burger King, baker's assistant, warehouse organizer, etc. I worked in pain because of my illness but pretended I was fine. I've never been able to buy anything of value.

In the last few months, at my last job, someone threw a rock at my head while I was cleaning up trash in a favela (slum). So I left the garbage collection company with nothing in front of me and I am unemployed. I never last long in any job because I can't hide my illness for more than 3 months. But after I left the garbage collection company I took a carpentry course. My family considers me lazy.

But nothing I do is enough, no matter how hard I try, nothing I do moves forward. I've tried everything, in every way, and nothing has worked. I took a risk traveling alone with just a backpack on my back through several Federal States looking for an opportunity to change my life, but nothing worked. I went through hunger, thirst, cold, humiliation and ab--e uselessly.

Despite all this, I've seen, heard or read *COUNTLESS* times people saying that Epilepsy is not a disabling disease and that epileptics can live a perfectly normal life, working and everything else, if they take their medication correctly.

I've been taking 5 prescription drugs a day since I was 11: valproic acid. The chemicals in this drug are so strong that I defecate whenever I want, I just have to sit down and squeeze my stomach, and it all comes out. After so many years of use, my body is addicted to the substance. When it's out of stock at the health center, like now, my parents have to find a way to buy boxes with their credit card. Until they buy it, it only takes about 10 days for me to feel the side effects of withdrawal.

Epilepsy is the result of a brain that produces excess electricity. This enhances the epileptic's natural intelligence, but has all the side effects mentioned in the post. What valproic acid does is reduce the brain's electrical activity to normal levels to have an anticonvulsant effect. This consequently reflects on the epileptic's natural intelligence being reduced to normal levels. I love studying different subjects, Worldbuilding, fantasy and RPG but I can't concentrate or finish what I start. I feel the veins on the sides of my head burning.

The worst thing about epilepsy is that, according to the package insert, if I want to have children I need to abstain from this medication for a minimum period, because otherwise the substance would be passed through my sperm and would make my wife unable to get pregnant. But during that period, abstinence can kill me. Even if she managed to get pregnant, the baby would be born with deformities. Not to mention the chances of miscarriage and stillbirth. Summary: Chemically castrated.

My only dream has always been to marry a normal girl, move to the countryside, have 12 children, watch them grow up, grow old with my wife and die smiling knowing that my children and grandchildren are on the right path.

I've come to the conclusion that there's no point in trying anymore. What's the point? I've tried everything. Honestly, of course. Nothing works. Nothing changes. Nothing gets better. No one has ever recognized my efforts.

Enough."

Although I haven’t received acknowledgment of a PF, have seen changes on my loan admin site in the phrasing of the forbearance and a capitalized interest account history line - so things are looking good. 

Today got an email from MOHELA, two documents. One was interest accumulation for 2024 taxes. Other was a repayment schedule change stating a repayment due 5/11/25 but the amount is the same as my SAVE amount.  

This appears to be a mistake because my IBR payment was supposed to be almost twice that of SAVE. And why a payment due two months after my forbearance ends? God I hate this. "

Recently Banned Today from r/Muslim,TrueChristian,1i9x08m,2025-01-25 16:04:14,11,0.74,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1i9x08m/recently_banned_today_from_rmuslim/,TurbulentMinute4290,,"So I was banned today from r/Muslim for talking about Jesus and how He prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. Someone said Jesus must be Muslim because He prayed in a way that looks like how Muslims pray. I brought up Matthew 26:39, where Jesus says, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will. ” This shows Jesus talking to God the Father and following His will to die for our sins. Islam denies Jesus died on the cross, though, so how can Muslims say He was following God’s will when they don’t even believe in the mission He was praying about? That doesn’t make sense.Another thing that doesn’t make sense is how the Quran talks about Jesus being born of a virgin, performing miracles, being taken to heaven, and even returning at the end of times—yet it says He’s just an ordinary prophet. Why would Allah create Jesus in such a unique way if He’s just like every other prophet? Every other prophet, including Muhammad, was born to two normal parents. Why make Jesus different? Why give Him such a miraculous birth and a special role? The Quran gives no explanation for this. It doesn’t tell us why Jesus was created this way, and it leaves a huge question unanswered: If He’s just an ordinary man, why treat Him so differently?

The Bible, on the other hand, explains this perfectly. Jesus’s Virgin Birth wasn’t random or meaningless. It was part of God’s plan to show us who Jesus really is. Isaiah 7:14 says, “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel,” which means “God with us.” Jesus wasn’t just a prophet; He was the Son of God, sent to save humanity. His miracles weren’t just signs of a great prophet—they were proof of His divine nature. The Virgin Birth showed that Jesus was fully God and fully man, able to bridge the gap between sinful people and a holy God. The Bible gives meaning to everything about Jesus’s life, from His birth to His death and resurrection. It shows why we need Him and why He is the Savior of the world.

Another person called Christians idol worshipers because we believe Jesus is God. They said, “God doesn’t need to come down to earth or die for anything. He just says, ‘Be, and it is.’” But if God is all-powerful, why couldn’t He choose to come down to live among His creation as one of them? The Bible says in John 1:14, “The Word became flesh and lived among us.” God chose to come to us through Jesus, to live among us and die for us. That’s not weakness—it’s love. It shows how much He cared for us, enough to do what we couldn’t do for ourselves.

Here’s another thing to think about: If Jesus is just another prophet, why does the Quran say He’s coming back at the end of times to defeat the Dajjal? Why not Muhammad, who is called the “final prophet”? Why give Jesus this special role? The Quran doesn’t explain it, but the Bible does. The Bible shows that Jesus is central to God’s plan for humanity. He came to live a perfect life, die on the cross for our sins, and rise again to give us eternal life. His return at the end of times is part of His mission to bring justice and establish God’s kingdom. Everything about Jesus makes sense in the Bible, but the Quran leaves so many questions unanswered.

Muslims often say Jesus must be Muslim because He obeyed God and prayed in a way similar to how Muslims pray. But they ignore that He was praying to the Father about dying on the cross—the very thing they deny ever happened. How does that work? If you don’t believe in what He was praying about, how can you claim He was following the will of God in the way Islam teaches? That doesn’t add up.

I’m sharing this because I thought it was funny that they had to ban me. The whole religion is one big joke. I believe Satan created it because he was mad about how Christianity was spreading monotheism across the world. He gave them his own version of monotheism but twisted it so they wouldn’t believe in Jesus and couldn’t get salvation. That’s exactly what it looks like—a religion created to steer people away from the Savior.

The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge,DaughtersOfLilith_666,1i9x05o,2025-01-25 16:04:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaughtersOfLilith_666/comments/1i9x05o/the_mystical_symbolism_of_the_key_unlocking/,MortismaStMacabre,,"The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge





https://preview.redd.it/5cpnrl2jf7fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6e2ffba05bcce8d7f9a4b75efd49e6773d783f9

Introduction Throughout history, the key has served as a powerful symbol in mystical traditions, folklore, and spiritual practices. Its dual nature—as both a tool of access and restriction—connects it to profound themes of mystery, transformation, and hidden wisdom. Across cultures, the key is a potent metaphor for unlocking doors to new opportunities, guarding sacred spaces, and bridging the gap between worlds. Keys in History and Mythology

1. Ancient Civilizations:

* In ancient Egypt, the ankh, often interpreted as a ""key of life,"" symbolized eternal life and was believed to unlock the gates of the afterlife (Wilkinson, 2003).
* Greek and Roman mythology depicts gods like Hecate, the goddess of crossroads, and Janus, the god of transitions, holding keys. These deities embodied access to hidden realms, marking the key as a symbol of passage and authority (Kerényi, 1951).

1. Medieval  Symbolism:

* During the Middle Ages, keys were emblems of power and responsibility. Guardians of sacred or protected spaces often carried keys as symbols of their authority (Coveney, 1988).
* In alchemy, keys represented the unlocking of esoteric knowledge, marking the transformative journey from ignorance to enlightenment (Fabricius, 1994).

1. Folklore:

* In European fairy tales, keys often appear as instruments of both curiosity and caution. Stories like Bluebeard use keys to symbolize forbidden knowledge and the consequences of seeking it (Zipes, 2013).

The Key as a Mystical Symbol

1. Access  and Transition:

* Keys embody the concept of transition, representing access to new opportunities, solutions, or spiritual realms. They are often associated with liminality—the state of being on the threshold between two worlds  (Turner, 1969).
* They also symbolize closure, enabling individuals to lock away past pain,  negativity, or unwanted influences.

1. Guardianship  and Protection:

* Keys have been used as protective talismans. Hung over doorways, worn as jewelry, or placed under pillows, they were believed to ward off evil spirits or misfortune (Danaher, 1972).
* The act of locking something away with a key symbolized safeguarding treasures, secrets, or sacred knowledge.

1. Hidden Knowledge:

* In mystical traditions, the key represents the seeker’s journey to uncover truths. Possessing a key often implies mastery over knowledge or access to divine mysteries (Chevalier & Gheerbrant, 1996).
* In some magical systems, the design or material of the key carries symbolic weight, such as an antique key representing ancestral wisdom or a modern key symbolizing contemporary insight.

Keys in Witchcraft and Rituals

1. Ritual Tool:

* Keys are often used in rituals to open or close energetic pathways. For example, a key may be used to symbolically ""unlock"" a sacred circle or ""seal"" a spell (Cunningham, 2002).
* They are also employed in spells to unlock opportunities, love, or prosperity—or to close doors on harmful influences.

1. Crossroads and Choice:

* Keys are deeply tied to the symbolism of crossroads, a common theme in witchcraft. At a crossroads, the key becomes a metaphor for decision-making, transformation, and guidance through life’s transitions  (Guiley, 1999).
* Hecate often depicted holding keys, represents the ability to navigate these pivotal moments and unlock new paths.

1. Symbolic  Uses:

* A  single key can symbolize simplicity and focused intention, while a ring of keys may represent knowledge, authority, or the ability to unlock multiple possibilities.
* Skeleton keys, in particular, are favored in magical practices for their versatility and association with unlocking any door (Grimassi, 2004).

Cultural Symbolism and Practices

1. Hecate’s Keys (Ancient Greek Tradition):

* Hecate,  the Greek goddess of witchcraft and crossroads, is often depicted holding keys, symbolizing her role as a guide through transitions and a guardian of thresholds (Johnston, 1990).
* Devotees of Hecate might include a key in rituals to invoke her guidance, often leaving a key as an offering at a crossroads.

1. Roman  Rituals with Janus:

* Janus, the Roman god of doorways, beginnings, and endings, was associated with keys. In Roman tradition, keys were symbolic tools during New Year’s rituals, representing the opening of new opportunities and the closing of the past (Beard, 1998).
* Celebrants often used symbolic keys in blessings to invoke prosperity and protection for the year ahead.

1. Keys in Marriage Traditions:

* In some Scandinavian and Eastern European traditions, keys were incorporated into wedding ceremonies. The groom would gift a symbolic key to the bride, representing the opening of a new life together or her role as guardian of the household (Murdoch, 2001).
* In  India, the key to the family’s safe or treasure chest is traditionally given to the matriarch as a symbol of her authority and responsibility.

1. Shinto Shrine Practices (Japan):

* Keys often appear in Shinto shrines, associated with the deities Inari and their fox messengers. These keys, typically held in the mouths of fox statues, symbolize the unlocking of rice granaries and prosperity (Rosenberger, 1992).

1. Key-Carrying Customs in Europe:

* In medieval Europe, women often carried a key as a sign of their authority over the household and its resources. This practice extended into rituals where keys were buried in new foundations to bless the space and ensure protection (Sennett, 1994).

Keys in Modern Symbolic Practices

1. Keys for Manifestation:

* Modern practitioners often carry a small key charm as a reminder of their personal goals, representing the ability to ""unlock"" potential or manifest dreams (Andrews, 2002).
* Vision boards may include images of keys to symbolize opening doors to success or new opportunities.

1. Key Tattoos and Jewelry:

* Key designs in tattoos and jewelry are popular as symbols of individuality,  secrets, or life transitions. They often serve as reminders of the wearer’s ability to unlock their destiny or protect their own inner ""treasure.""

ConclusionAcross cultures and traditions, the key has played a vital role in rituals and symbolic practices. Whether used to protect, unlock hidden truths, or signify authority, the key remains a universal emblem of transformation and possibility. Its enduring power lies in its ability to represent both access and protection, making it a deeply personal and mystical tool. References

VIP Tesla Taxi reckless driving,dubai,1i9wz0o,2025-01-25 16:02:45,6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1i9wz0o/vip_tesla_taxi_reckless_driving/,ImaginaryGain0,,"So about 30-45 minutes ago while I was on Al Maktoum bridge heading home, a Tesla Taxi kept brake checking the bus that was behind him. The bus driver eventually had enough and changed lanes. I then came up on the Tesla Taxi and he did the same to me. I flashed at him and changed lanes to overtake him at which point he suddenly increased his speed to match mine and manoeuvred  his car close to mine to stop me from doing so. Luckily my lane was a bit empty so increased my speed and changed back into the lane now being in front of him. He then continuously kept flashing at me and kept trying to overtake me from different lanes, but I headed into a 2nd tunnel and he almost hit the divider still trying to overtake or crash into (god knows). 

I had spotted him doing the same thing in the SZR tunnel with other cars just before this happened as well. Driving at 69 and brake checking cars behind him.

Has RTA just started giving out driving licenses to anyone and everyone.

PS I don’t remember the number plate although I do suspect he was drunk looking at the way he was driving! Anything that can be done In scenario?"

Most underrated Nintendo villain and why?

Achi from Sin & Punishment. She groomed Saki Amamiya to be a super-soldier after she healed him with some of her power (+ getting him and Airan Jo to join her ""Savior Group""), leading him to turn into a Ruffian (Kaiju) when she floods Tokyo with blood, and helps destroys Tokyo in his fight with Kachua. He then goes into a comatose state. Achi then tells Airan to shoot Saki in this form, and sends her into a dream state with her future son when she refuses. After Airan shoots Saki, Achi sends her into his Kaiju body to make Saki human again.

Once that is done, she goes mask off by sending them to a beach as to keep them away from her. But they both get up, so Achi kidnaps Airan. After Saki gets past her goons, she just starts hurling meteors to the Earth (which Saki has to destroy in Ruffian form), yet that fails so she disappears.

After all of that trauma, Saki still occasionally turns into a Ruffian, which his son (Isa Amamiya) sees, terrifies him, and changes his last name to his mothers maiden name after she tries to comfort him (so now he is Isa Jo). Saki and Airan are presumed dead in Star Successor, and Isa is now in the military of Earth 4. After an outsider that the gods of the universe want dead enters into Earth 4 (and threatens to destroy the Earth), Isa is sent to kill it.

>!Her name is Achi, and she lost her memory. Isa feels bad, so he protects her against his old friends, discovers and uses his ruffian form, and uses that to end his old friend Deko and save Achi. After they both touch down to Earth, Achi reveals to Isa she has regained her memory, including her name. When Isa asks for her name out of curiosity, she states her name is Kachi. With her enemies defeated and the twist revealed, the game ends there.!<

Kachi is essentially a master manipulator, that destroyed countless lives on Earth (and perhaps on many Earths) just to get her way for petty power."
