Can only download / view old media uploads,matrixdotorg,1i8xmbv,2025-01-24 10:13:34,2,0.75,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/matrixdotorg/comments/1i8xmbv/can_only_download_view_old_media_uploads/,justeverything61,,"edit#2// nevermind... some things were cached in my old browser... using a fresh session made it work. -.-



Dear reddit,

I just migrated my synapse server (from standalone instance with nginx proxy to docker ""synapse"" with nginx proxy ""synapse\_proxy"") to another host, keeping the hostname and most of the configuration from homeserver.yaml. Also moved over the database and the media\_store. I'm able to login on th new server, send and receive messages and open  preview / download media files that were present pre-migration.

If I not upload any new media no thumbnails are generated and I can't download the file. Downloading results in following errors:

The paths / files that are specified in the logs are existant for old and for new files. They also have the same permissions for the synapse user (in docker it's ID 991) - any ideas? :/

edit:// the GUI shows this error for the new files:

`An error occurred while downloading this fileM_NOT_FOUND: MatrixError: [404] Not found (https://messenger.domain.de/_matrix/media/v3/download/messenger.domain.de/rmZheQQYLhoAuismATSuminl?allow_redirect=true)`

on disk I can see the file at the media\_store path `/media_store/local_content/rm/Zh/eQQYLhoAuismATSuminl`

# 1. Ryan Wedding former Olympian turned sinaloan drug lord

 [https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/g-s1-28859/canadian-olympic-snowboarder-wanted-drug-trafficking](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/g-s1-28859/canadian-olympic-snowboarder-wanted-drug-trafficking) 

This article outlines his charges and establishes his connection to nahim jorge bonilla (restauranter and music exec), it also states semi trucks were used to distribute from southern California, miami and Canada from Mexico. Also important was his use of tracking via dollar bills and private third party messages. It also names his right hand man Andrew Clark. They intercepted several million in drugs cash and crypto also per this article

[**Former Canadian Olympian is accused of being a fugitive drug lord**](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/g-s1-28859/canadian-olympic-snowboarder-wanted-drug-trafficking)

Andrew and nahim were arrested in October 2024 while wedding remains a fugitive.

[https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/16-defendants-charged-superseding-indictment-alleging-bulk-shipments-cocaine-canada](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/16-defendants-charged-superseding-indictment-alleging-bulk-shipments-cocaine-canada)

This is from the justice department which goes into more details and names two more men one of which is hardeep ratte and per this next article has deep ties in dubai



[**16 Defendants Charged in Superseding Indictment Alleging Bulk Shipments of Cocaine to Canada, Four Murders**](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/16-defendants-charged-superseding-indictment-alleging-bulk-shipments-cocaine-canada)

[**Alleged drug smuggler for Canadian ex-Olympian could flee if granted bail, prosecutors say | CBC News**](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7429946)

Hardeep is described in this article as a toronto area man

Also mentions second in command Andrew clark, who's in this next article as well and this article describes a long time associate of Wedding and Clark's set Clark up to be arrested and is now a ci. This also goes on to describe clark as a landlord via submission he put into a magazine which is linked in the article. Note the mention of him being a landlord [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.736177](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7361772)

Side bar.. this is everyone involved so far or at least on the wanted lost for operation slolam

# 2. Now onto Nahim...

some of the same articles I will re link to ack up what I'm trying to outline..

[https://amp.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article294340314.html](https://amp.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article294340314.html)

The article above describes Nahim bonilla as a restauranter (mandrake miami) and music exec (ruido callajero). It also goes on to state he was arrested at his mansion in Aventura, which was purchased from DJ Khaled in 2020

The article also describes how bonilla go caught up with wedding by not paying for a shipment in full. The following article also describes the incident in more detail while also labeling nahim as a montreal bar owner and landlord who left Canada for America in 2019 just before he purchased khaleds home.

[**Montreal landlord accused of shipping meth to repay fugitive ex-Olympian | CBC News**](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7392449)

Also goes on to describe several shootings and parsons at his home in Quebec and how he refused to discuss them.

Let's dive into who also purchased khaleds home with nahim.. Mr. Simon librati.. who according to this website purchased the home together via the prime med group business

[https://traded.co/deals/florida/single-family-residence/sale/3914-island-estates-drive/#deal-comps](https://traded.co/deals/florida/single-family-residence/sale/3914-island-estates-drive/#deal-comps)

[**Simon Librati & Nahim Jorge Bonilla Acquire DJ Khaled’s Aventura SFR For $4.8M | 3914 Island Estates Drive | Janet Ben Zvi, Caterine Gomez, Julian Johnston | Single Family Residence | Sale | Traded**](https://traded.co/deals/florida/single-family-residence/sale/3914-island-estates-drive/#deal-comps)

# 4. Quick diversion into Mr. Librati

 [https://x.com/Sweetcaligurl07/status/1846920502641938955](https://x.com/Sweetcaligurl07/status/1846920502641938955)

And per this link and property shark it appears the Aventura property sold for $10 in 2022

Per the first x article and this following article librati is a candian businessman/disgraced and apparently has a non profit that deals with children?

Anyway so not only was he a disgraced day trader but also apparently owns and founded the miami yacht club via the fusion miami group [https://themiamibeachyachtclub.com/team/](https://themiamibeachyachtclub.com/team/)

So now we're going to head on over to open corporates to dive into Mr libratis businesses

[https://opencorporates.com/officers?utf8=%E2%9C%93&utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Simon+librati&jurisdiction\_code=&type=officers](https://opencorporates.com/officers?utf8=%E2%9C%93&utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Simon+librati&jurisdiction_code=&type=officers)

But upon looking you find one named simon and nahim holdings

Incorporated in August 2020 not long after the purchase of khaleds property

You'll find other weird names and business that I'm sure are worth diving into but for the purpose of staying on track I will hold off however

There's more business with nahim.. such as sea-era charters.. also started August 2020

You'll also find the prime med group which supposedly states was he and nahims group that purchased khaleds home however he's not listed on this doc.. only an mxc But still incorporated before the purchase of khaleds home

[https://opencorporates.com/officers?q=Nahim+bonilla&utf8=%E2%9C%93](https://opencorporates.com/officers?q=Nahim+bonilla&utf8=%E2%9C%93)

Here he has the khaled home listed as an entity.. which also listing himself with different name variations

This was established June 2020 at the time of the sale of khaleds home

You'll also find his incorporation for Mandrake Miami, Ruido Cajallero and a funny looking one called Mr puffs holdings.. BTW sidebar, these three mentioned has what I'm assuming to be his wife Samantha granda who is a singer under the name mel granda.

Mr. Puffs appears to be a dessert club started by a couple of Greek guys in Canada a while back and only recently started offering franchising and have them in Canada, Michigan I believe and Orlando.. so okay maybe nahims Mr. Puffs is for a franchise of this business right? However.. there's only one in florida.. 3 hours away in Orlando and the incorporation for that franchise was in 2019..before nahims in 2020.. again around the time of the khaled purchase

Also want to note Nahims Mr. Puffs incorporation is in miami.. nowhere near a Mr. Puffs dessert club as far as I could find

# 5. But what connection does nahim have to diddy?

For one.. if you look at their insta and really dig into their stories and photos you'll find a lot of key players.. diddy, his son Justin, Cuba and I think claudine in the back ground, kd, khaled.. I'm sure there's more but you get the picture

[https://www.instagram.com/mandrakemiami/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/mandrakemiami/?hl=en)

Here's an article describing diddy throwing his sons 21st birthday at mandrake in 2019 which I think is before bonilla may have taken ownership on paper but has been there since via insta [https://pagesix.com/2019/04/02/diddys-son-christian-combs-goes-all-out-for-21st-birthday/](https://pagesix.com/2019/04/02/diddys-son-christian-combs-goes-all-out-for-21st-birthday/)

Oh and the tea room may offer specialty drink specials.. hmm do she look good but she ain't got no taste??

So yeah anyway diddy likes the place okay? Can't find drake anywhere near the place but you know who really really really loves it?

Khaled

Check back to the insta too.. he was there a lot.. also important to note, the og dk post that started all this has a lot in the comments.. and someone stated this place closed down in like may

Oh yeah and meek obviously been here too, the drink and this article.. and we all know who meek is tied to.. Mr kraft and Mr rubin [https://worldredeye.com/2019/01/meek-mill-fabolous-host-dusse-dinner-mandrake/](https://worldredeye.com/2019/01/meek-mill-fabolous-host-dusse-dinner-mandrake/)"

So I didn't even realize the datadash app didn't work anymore and I'm having trouble finding info. Is there a way to access my mxc? Is it even still there? I joined the moonchain Telegram but they don't seem the most helpful.

Help! Error when using SharePoint List in Power Automate Approval Flow,MicrosoftFlow,1i2zicx,2025-01-16 16:12:29,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlow/comments/1i2zicx/help_error_when_using_sharepoint_list_in_power/,Interesting_Book_598,Cloud,"I am building a cloud approval flow where employees submit a request on a list in SharePoint, and based on a choice field in that list, I want it to route to different people for approval. 

I scoured the internet and found several things saying to use a configuration list, also built in SharePoint. I built the second list and followed the instructions and built the flow, and I keep getting an error: 

""Action 'Get\_items' failed""   
""The expression ""Title eq 'MXC - (Men's Cross Country)'"" is not valid. Creating query failed.""

In the list where they submit items, the internal column name is Team, and the internal column name in the configuration list is Title. I have single quotes around the value in the filter query line. 

Here is one of the main blogs with info about creating a configuration list:

Last bike I raced was a KTM 250 MXC, Pat Timothy’s spare race bike back in the early 2000s. If you know NETRA you know Pat. Anyways, my dad died back in 2018 and I kept his Harley and his 1995 Husky 250. I’ve had many medical issues myself since then but now I’m doing better and I’m looking to rebuild it. It hasn’t ran since 2018. Just sitting in the corner in the garage. Im a certified Harley mechanic so working on it isn’t a big deal BUT finding parts is. Does anyone know of any websites or anyone that has or specializes in older Husqvarna parts? Any leads would be very appreciated. "

Edit: The next morning. 

After 4 or 5 more listening.

Is it possible this is the most brilliantly crafted piece of a symbiotic music about someone baring for all the world to see his personal struggles with his mental health by a perfect matching of melody, lyrics and vocal performance ?

I also must say that I have done an online search to get some background on Ren. I suppose that posting this song does not properly fit the philosophy of thie sub. I might have not heard of Ren or the song before but I learned it gained enough popularity to take it out of the obscure songs and artists the site is intended to highlight. My bad. But I'm not sorry. "

Razer signature edition mouse- 300 bucks and no spare parts available from Razer!!,razer,1hvu69m,2025-01-07 10:41:09,0,0.5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1hvu69m/razer_signature_edition_mouse_300_bucks_and_no/,joverclock,Question,"So... I am one of the weirdo's who spent 300 dollars on a mouse directly from Razer. Amazing mouse but it did not include the wirless dongle it was supposed to. Finally reached out to Razer and they told me they have no spare parts and it should have been in the box. I still have the box and its still not in there... It has not been a year since purchase(close) and at 300 dollars you would think they would be able to support their product.  Anyone else deal with this sort of nonesense from Razer before? 

Note : they still sell the mouse on their website

"Settling down, LatAm v Europe",digitalnomad,1huj6lh,2025-01-05 17:24:39,3,0.67,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1huj6lh/settling_down_latam_v_europe/,BowtiedGypsy,Question,"Hi all, looking for some random opinions here. 

Me and my soon to be wife have been traveling for 2+ years, largely between LatAm and Europe. We’ve been doing monthly Airbnbs and hopping to new places every month, which is honestly getting tiring. We’re hoping to settle down a bit more in the spring, not necessarily in the traditional sense but at least having a home base. 

We’re pretty torn between two options and I’d love to get some opinions. 

Option 1 is Budapest. We like Central Europe a lot, it’s pretty affordable and taxes aren’t too bad in terms of being in Europe. We love the idea of being able to cheaply (flights) travel Europe and not worry about Schengen rules (we’re American). The thing is, Hungary is slightly higher taxes than most LatAm countries + Hungary and the US technically just ended their double tax treaty. 

The other major issue with Hungary, is that visas aren’t easy to get (or so it seems). We’ll need to establish a business there prior to even applying for the visa, funding a business account (+ paying loads of fees on the setup it seems). The visa process can be very lengthy, complicated and although we meet the requirements we’re not positive we’d get it. Citizenship is also very far away and requires learning Hungarian, which is supposed to be super difficult to learn. 

Schengen rules also play into effect, as we can only legally enter Schengen for 5 days as of right now. We’re currently in Turkey and spending about 90 days out of Schengen, but we just left a few days ago - so we don’t get the full 90 days until July. We originally planned on my soon to be wife going for a family reunification visa instead of going for her own business visa thinking this would be simpler, but there’s no way we wouldn’t run out of Schengen days before mine came in - making things pretty complicated. 

Option 2 is splitting time between 2 places in LatAm (and avoiding becoming tax residents). Thinking Playa Del Carmen + Medellin, or MXC + Lima. We love LatAm, would like to travel more adventurously there, love the weather and the cultures + Spanish is a language we already have decent grasps on and could probably be conversational within about six months. 

Visas are much easier to get here, and Mexico is closer to home (Boston).

Some info about us:

We love traveling Europe and have spent a bit more time here than LatAm. We’d love to have a base and be able to take cheap flights or trains to travel on occasional weekends to other cities. We love the walk ability and public transportation, safety is never an issue (we know most of LatAm is safe, but it just doesn’t feel like the same level of safety as most of Europe if that makes sense). We love cafe lined streets, plenty of things to do in the area, and a great social scene. We’re fairly young (mid 20s) so nightlife and these things are important. 

We’re a bit torn right now, and getting eventually dual citizenship is big. Paying less in taxes is also huge. Not sure which we should be more focused on - although if we chose the no tax option, I know we could get LatAm citizenship within 5 years, and then Spain citizenship 2 years after that - pretty close to the 8 year citizenship path in Hungary. 

What do you guys think? Has anyone settled in these places and have an opinion? Should we focus more on paying less (close to 0) taxes, or focus on citizenship? 

Any sort of thoughts people have would be greatly appreciated. "

I have upgraded Mexico City to max level. The next logical step in my mind would be to put one more Kangaroo going back and forth between San Francisco and LA to supply more jobs. Would I get enough jobs to Tokyo/Seoul if I fully upgraded San Francisco? "
