I can feel your Karrat anger ,KARRATCRYPTO,1hv0ktx,2025-01-06 09:44:17,3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1hv0ktx/i_can_feel_your_karrat_anger/,tracksta6,,"`To start off, you all and I both know I have no f'n clue what will happen. The coins that blew up in the last 2 cycles were the ones that caught public attention. My bet (or gamble) is on $Karrat because I think My Pet Hooligan and The Others have the potential to grab that spotlight during the final 3-month FOMO bull rush.`

`I think (emphasis on THINK) this could be a 10-20x ($5-$10) in that rush. If it actually gets pushed to consoles like Xbox, as has been hinted, that could open the door for a 100x ($50) because it brings in the mainstream.`

https://i.redd.it/sx5wa2k10ebe1.gif

`Sure, we all want that 100x—no argument there. But my money is here because I feel confident in a 10x, and I’d rather bet on a project with utility and potential than chase random meme or AI coins. There will be success stories in those spaces, no doubt, but I like the odds here.`

`Yeah, it’s depressing that Karrat isn’t moving much right now. But like AXS and GALA, I’m not here expecting steady, long-term growth. I’m here for the potential of an exponential rise, followed by the inevitable crash. My gamble is on timing that moment.`"

I filled out all the coinbase support question & ask them - I want to know everything there is to know about the authorisation of this hash:  0xcc6e73a35cef3d7a9bb6e8ee21a71b15c224f2fb70465904a3be24156e42172f
The malicious wallet has nothing in it except PRQ no ETH. Nothing has moved which seems strange. I did not click on any links or talked to anyone over the phone regarding my Coinbase acct. I have done a malware scan, nothing detected. I have been logged into Coinbase for a week or 2. My MetaMask is also logged in. I have some small balances on a few different chains & loads of eth nfts so if my machine was compromised seems like all this would also be gone. So depositing or buy KARRAT triggered something. I am holding another token which was not touched besides KARRAT. So odd, I know the risk of not practicing self custody. I don’t expect coinbase to be helpful. Just leaves a bad taste. "

What Are The Others and How Could They Boost $Karrat?,KARRATCRYPTO,1hjmhcp,2024-12-21 18:53:50,1,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1hjmhcp/what_are_the_others_and_how_could_they_boost/,tracksta6,,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been diving into the *My Pet Hooligan* ecosystem , and I wanted to share what I’ve learned about *The Others*, how it ties into $Karrat, and why it could have a big impact on the token's future.

# What Are The Others?

*The Others* is a metaverse expansion project by AMGI Studios, the creators of *My Pet Hooligan*. It’s not just an add-on to MPH—it’s a larger metaverse experience designed to bring together multiple worlds, characters, and narratives. Think of it as a cross-platform, immersive environment where players and creators can interact, play, and build.

It expands the vision of Web3 gaming by allowing for:

* **New gameplay experiences**: Beyond the fast-paced action of MPH, *The Others* is designed to include exploration, social interactions, and creative expression.
* **Community-driven content**: Players and creators can contribute to the metaverse with new assets, events, and stories.

# How Is It Associated with $Karrat?

$Karrat serves as the **core currency** of this entire ecosystem, including *The Others*. Its utility goes beyond MPH and extends to everything *The Others* offers:



# Transactions:

   * Buy, sell, or trade assets like NFTs, skins, and customizations.
   * $Karrat powers the economy for in-game purchases and marketplace activity.

# Staking & Governance:

   * Holders of $Karrat could potentially stake their tokens for rewards and participate in governance decisions, influencing how *The Others* evolves.

# Interactive NFTs:

   * The NFTs in *The Others* aren’t just collectibles—they’re interactive, customizable, and can be tied directly to gameplay and metaverse functionality.

# How Can The Others Help $Karrat’s Price?

1. **Increased Demand for $Karrat:**
   * As *The Others* grows, the demand for $Karrat increases because it’s the central currency of the ecosystem. Players will need $Karrat for transactions, customizations, and access to exclusive features.
2. **Mainstream Exposure:**
   * *The Others* aims to attract a broader audience by integrating both Web2 and Web3 users. If it gains traction on platforms like Xbox or Steam, millions of new players could be exposed to $Karrat, driving up demand.
3. **Scarcity Effect:**
   * If staking is introduced or the ecosystem requires $Karrat to unlock NFTs or premium features, it could reduce circulating supply, creating upward pressure on the price.
4. **Metaverse Hype:**
   * Projects associated with the metaverse (like Decentraland or The Sandbox) saw massive price growth in the last bull run. If *The Others* captures even a fraction of that attention, $Karrat could see similar benefits.

# Final Thoughts

*The Others* isn’t just a side project—it’s a key piece of the $Karrat ecosystem that could expand its utility and value significantly. By building a larger metaverse with cross-platform appeal and interactive NFTs, AMGI Studios is setting up $Karrat to be more than just a token tied to a single game.

If you’re holding or thinking about investing in $Karrat, keep an eye on updates for *The Others*. It could be a major catalyst for the token, especially as we approach the next bull run.

What do you all think? Do you see *The Others* being a game-changer for $Karrat? Let’s discuss!"

These shifts were driven by evolving market narratives, trends, and hype cycles. Here’s an analysis of when each genre gained major inflows of capital:

https://preview.redd.it/as32vw0t5x6e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c862be8aa72bf4354664f5f98b5d0f9c9a208d7

>**1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - Initial Surge: Mid-2020**

* The DeFi boom began in summer 2020, often referred to as ""DeFi Summer.""
* Key drivers included platforms like Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP), and [Yearn.Finance](http://Yearn.Finance) (YFI), which introduced yield farming and liquidity mining.
* DeFi tokens dominated attention from mid-2020 to early 2021 as users chased high returns and DeFi total value locked (TVL) surged.

>

>**2. Gaming and Metaverse Coins - nitial Surge: Mid-2021**

* Gaming and metaverse tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (MANA) gained traction during Q2–Q3 2021.
* Axie Infinity drove the narrative with its play-to-earn (P2E) model, which saw rapid adoption in emerging markets.
* The metaverse hype reached its peak in late 2021, fueled by Facebook’s rebranding to Meta in October 2021.

>

>**3. Meme Coin** \-  Initial Surge: Early 2021

* Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged in popularity during Q1–Q2 2021.
* Elon Musk’s tweets and the broader retail investor craze (e.g., Reddit-driven pumps) contributed to the explosive growth of DOGE, which peaked in May 2021.
* SHIB followed in Q2–Q3 2021, fueled by its community-driven growth and listing on major exchanges.

>

>**4. Layer-1 Protocols**

* Initial Surge: Late 2020 to Early 2021
* Layer-1 tokens like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) saw significant inflows as Ethereum faced scalability issues.
* From late 2020 through Q3 2021, investors sought alternatives to Ethereum, driving the growth of competing blockchains.

>

>**5. NFT -  Initial Surge: Q1–Q2 2021**

* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in early 2021, driven by projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and major auctions like Beeple’s $69M NFT sale in March 2021.
* The NFT craze aligned closely with the gaming/metaverse hype in Q3–Q4 2021, expanding into broader cultural and entertainment sectors.

>

* **6. Privacy Coins -  Initial Surge: Early to Mid-2021**
* Coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) saw renewed interest in Q1 2021, as concerns about regulatory scrutiny and privacy grew during the bull run.
* This genre's surge was smaller compared to others but aligned with broader crypto adoption.

* Privacy Coins            Early 2021                    Mid-2021

>Observations and Takeaways:

>Rotational Capital:

1.  Money rotated through genres as the market narratives shifted.
2.   Early adopters of each genre benefited the most as capital inflows surged.
3.   Gaming as a Late-Stage Winner: Gaming and metaverse coins often peaked later in the cycle, especially during the altcoin season after Bitcoin and Ethereum had their major runs
4.    Meme Coins Thrive on Hype: Meme coins tend to surge during periods of retail euphoria, often spurred by social media campaigns.
5.    DeFi Pioneered the Bull Run: DeFi projects laid the groundwork for mainstream crypto adoption in mid-2020, establishing foundational protocols.

Looking Forward to the Next Bull Run - If historical patterns repeat, gaming/metaverse tokens like Karrat could see their major inflows in the latter stages of the next bull run, likely around Q3–Q4 2025. Meme coins and NFTs might see earlier retail-driven pumps, while DeFi and Layer-1s could kickstart the cycle.

# There is so much uncertainty about Karrat not sky-rocketing right now. We are early investors. The game, the coin, and everything that goes along with it are still being made. We see the developing product, but just know that the major flow into Karrat will not come until it is released and accepted.

Stay calm, be patient. It is not that Karrat is being rejected, it is that Karrat is not truly even in play yet.

Will sell before everyone goes euphoric and won't be too greedy.   
  
Hello everyone!

While not new to crypto, this is the first time I actually have money to invest into it and enough to make a real change in my life (without relying on moon meme luck).

But this poses its own issues, now I just want to buy every coin I see and hear about, and it's getting out of hand, right now I'm at 22 coins in my main portfolio (I have another meme one for gambling, only 5 coins), and there are a few extra coins I would like to get, but I think it's becoming too much and I wanted to listen to people here with more experience.

With this portfolio, I'm looking at 5-10x, which I don't think it's crazy (Is it? Is it too low?)

At the moment, I don't really have an exit plan other than start taking 25% out each month, once I start hearing about crypto from my aunts and the Uber driver, or when JPEGs are selling for the price of a super car.

Anyway, as you can seem I'm heavy on DePin/Ai, with some crypto gaming in there. I also know that XRP is a controversial subject, but it's the one project I'm solid on, so not looking for get rid of that one or HBAR. Anything else, I'm open to suggestions.

My Pet Hooligan Game (powered by [$KARRAT](https://x.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click)) 

We've been working incredibly hard, as the My Pet Hooligan game has been in pre-Alpha for a while now. It is imperative we move to an official Alpha release and get further distribution in line for a big go-to-market push. The main focus of the entire studio in closing out the year and going into Q1 2025 is getting our product market fit and ready for the masses. 

Off the Grid has shown you what's possible, My Pet Hooligan is up next! We have been heads down working on the infrastructure to support these areas of development: 

\- World Events System - Think multiplayer boss battles, multiplayer hordes, environmental changes, community challenges and dynamic storytelling 

\- Day 1 Experience - My Pet Hooligan is steeped in lore and comedy, we are building that in. The Day 1 experience will include story, tutorials and initials quests to introduce core mechanics 

\- Progression System - Having a rewarding journey for players and a sense of growth and accomplishment. Including a mix of unlockables and customizations. 

\- Faction Rep System - The seven factions are there for a reason. It's about time we made you pledge your allegiance and allow you to collective build your Factions reputation. With unique quests, rewards and player choices. 

As always, we are also working on environments, sound, further optimizations, UI and immersion. The game is our vessel for all our areas of innovation and development! What else do you want to see?.. 

Crypto We're finalizing the crypto architecture of the game. You have started to see building blocks go out. It's important to know that with the lack of maturity in the wider gaming industry and trying to reach a big audience we have to be innovative, creative and flexible. There are a number of areas that need to work seamlessly together eg. wallet, payment solutions, marketplaces, crypto on-ramps and blockchains. 

All are easy to do in isolation but weaving them together, whilst being able to be on all the top distribution platforms eg. Steam, Playstation, Xbox and conform to their requirements, whilst still having a frictionless experience for the end user is not a well trodden path. 

We at My Pet Hooligan believe we are building it and we are closing in on this every day and having to be able to adapt constantly as the industry and technological solutions evolve. Oh also My Pet Hooligan as of last week is no longer under contract with Polygon! Base, Solana, Avalanche, Immutable or our own L2 or AppChain?... What happens next, wait and see! 

The Others, Zuckbots, NFT rewards systems Is the traditional mechanism of minting NFTs and extracting from the community still the best distribution system or do we need to be more innovative? We believe the latter. The Others are still coming, Zuckbots will rise again, and genesis Hooligan holders are still King and will always be looked after. 

We believe we can do things bigger and better and with all the focus on the game build right now, we don't need to jump the gun. WinVote WinVote is nearing product readiness. The team has been fine tuning, and the experience is rapidly improving. As Kevin Mack would say “Make it work, make it right, make it fast”. As we get the WinVote product ready, we will be starting to go to market in the next few weeks. Expect more clients, features, more chains and more integrations. 

Access to WinVote for other communities and organizations wishing to use WinVote will be secured through licenses that utilize [$KARRAT](https://x.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click). 

While we already have some prospects, who would you like to see onboarded first? Tournament The My Pet Hooligan communities cup preparations are underway, with over 40 communities already signed up. The tournament is coming in December, in-line with the game's next big patch. 64 teams of 4 will be battling it out and there can only be one winner. The grand final will be held on the front page on Twitch and expect to see some big faces too! If your community wants in, reach out, there are not many spots left… 

TON, AI agents and other metas Can we make a Telegram App, can we launch an AI run X account. Although it's never been our policy to chase the latest trends. We can do all of these things and will always consider them and weigh up benefits vs. resources. 

Are these metas worth chasing or should we stick to our guns?.. Just know when things are quiet, it means we are heads down building, innovating and firefighting all in the name of making My Pet Hooligan THE standout Crypto Game and IP. My Pet Hooligan is the OG crypto gaming cult, we are all in this together!"

Karrat Token Unlocks - Explained - Rest at ease....,KARRATCRYPTO,1fu2bdi,2024-10-01 19:28:48,5,0.86,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1fu2bdi/karrat_token_unlocks_explained_rest_at_ease/,tracksta6,,"SIFTD:

1/ A lot of people panic when they hear about token unlocks. But in the right ecosystem, unlocks can actually fuel growth. Don’t believe me? Let’s compare [$KARRAT](https://x.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click) to some past winners like [$AXS](https://x.com/search?q=%24AXS&src=cashtag_click) and [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click).

>

2/ $KARRAT’s unlock schedule may seem hefty, with 18.14M KARRAT (\~15% of circulating supply and \~1.8% of total supply) hitting the market on Oct 19, 2024. And don’t forget, 12.35M tokens will unlock monthly through early 2025, adding another 1-1.5% of total supply each month.

https://preview.redd.it/06z897jmb8sd1.jpg?width=509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c83ded988b4a239790c28a649d49c4297ff500d

3/ Big one to watch? On April 19, 2025, 76M [$KARRAT](https://x.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click) will unlock, which represents 7.60% of the total supply. Major, right? But if you’re worried, just look at what happened with $AXS—a similar story.

https://preview.redd.it/eshj80rnb8sd1.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52a944bb7d4aa81c786a4b9b16f3a426eda578c1

4/ During the [$AXS](https://x.com/search?q=%24AXS&src=cashtag_click) rise, it had continuous token unlocks. The most significant event in mid-2021 saw nearly 11% of the total supply released (30% of circulating supply), but the token still surged from $0.14 to $165! Why? Ecosystem demand

https://preview.redd.it/a10efrzob8sd1.jpg?width=582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2cff15c9c67e1fd5648065fa4f71ee70b62b840

5/ It’s not just [$AXS](https://x.com/search?q=%24AXS&src=cashtag_click). [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) had massive unlocks in 2021 and still skyrocketed from under $2 to $260. The key takeaway: as long as the ecosystem grows, the tokens will be absorbed by the market without major corrections.

https://preview.redd.it/i9ptp9aqb8sd1.jpg?width=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=852cb97ad825253d66972cbcbf1a0677a56cd0c1

6/ Here’s the secret: Token unlocks aren’t inherently bad. They fund development, incentivise users, and expand the community. Projects with strong utility and engaged communities — like [$AXS](https://x.com/search?q=%24AXS&src=cashtag_click) and soon [$KARRAT](https://x.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click) — can handle these unlocks with ease.

7/ Let’s get back to [$KARRAT](https://x.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click): The demand for KARRAT is set to rise with upcoming projects like THE OTHERS, AI-powered collectibles. As these products launch, unlock events will feed the ecosystem, much like [$AXS](https://x.com/search?q=%24AXS&src=cashtag_click) did with its play-to-earn economy.

8/ Final thoughts: Don’t fear the unlocks. Just like [$AXS](https://x.com/search?q=%24AXS&src=cashtag_click), [$KARRAT](https://x.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click) has the ecosystem, community, and utility to thrive even with a significant unlock schedule. It’s not about the supply—it’s about the demand."

Section IV.M.2.a.vi: KARRAT Protocol (KARRAT)  
  
Trend Following Analysis of KARRAT Protocol in Cryptocurrency Markets  
  
Abstract  
  
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the KARRAT Protocol (KARRAT) within the framework of trend following strategies in cryptocurrency markets, as of 2024. KARRAT, distinguished for integrating blockchain technology with gaming and entertainment, represents a novel case study due to its unique market dynamics influenced by both technological innovation and community engagement. Utilizing real-time data from X posts and market analysis, this study evaluates KARRAT's performance against traditional trend following indicators like Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, and RSI. The analysis delves into how KARRAT's integration into platforms like Epic Games and its association with high-profile developers from Pixar and Disney affect its market trends. Furthermore, the paper explores the impact of decentralized governance and community-driven initiatives on KARRAT's price volatility and trend predictability. The findings suggest that while KARRAT exhibits characteristics conducive to trend following, its market behavior also reflects unique patterns due to its niche in the gaming sector, offering insights into adapting traditional financial strategies to emerging digital asset classes.

I'm a freelance designer so these are the books I tend to be surrounded by most of the time. I do have a few downstairs on display in our living room, and plenty boxed up in the loft, but these are the shelves I can reach for during the day when I need a break from work. It's not exclusively graphic novels, but mainly. There are some design, drawing and print making books, plus art materials in the cupboards and drawers. I’d say this is a pretty solid overview of my tastes.

Two things - sorry for the extreme Dutch angle on the third image, the rooms not quite big enough for me to get back far enough to take a picture of the whole shelving unit; and the small grey shark is where our cat rarely sleeps."

Karrat Deflationary Mechanisms,KARRATCRYPTO,1ey4s5v,2024-08-21 19:46:55,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1ey4s5v/karrat_deflationary_mechanisms/,tracksta6,,"Taken from the MPH and Karrat team directly! It has been mentioned on numerous occasions by the gen-pop about Karrat token releases in the near future and what that will do to the value? Well here you go!! - Know that not only is the team focused on creating an incredible game and associated products, but they also show direct concern and actions related to the economics as well. I have so much confidence in this project going forward!



-------------

Hey Hoolis - I have given significant thought around ecosystem and $KARRAT sustainability based on the conversations of a number of community members in various channels. It is my belief that now is the time to start focusing on **deflationary mechanisms** for $KARRAT.

Based on recent announcements, it appears that a slew of products are being released soon from our initial launch partner, My Pet Hooligan. These include a new patch to the game, NFTs back in the game, [Street Kred 2](https://x.com/mypethooligan/status/1788202507795108079), [The Others](https://x.com/mypethooligan/status/1799050575252000925), a Native Web3 Marketplace, the WinVote Governance Portal, and console support. Additionally, My Pet Hooligan is planning on showcasing our ecosystem and community at the upcoming gaming event PAX West. We expect this to over time lead to an influx of new players into the My Pet Hooligan ecosystem. Importantly, for us as a DAO, these products will likely all include avenues for players’ to spend $KARRAT. Now is the time to think how we can turn this spent $KARRAT into deflationary mechanisms to help reduce the effective supply of circulating $KARRAT. This brings the relationship between $KARRAT and My Pet Hooligan even closer together.

**Do you guys agree it’s time to start adding deflationary mechanisms?** In my mind, we should have a percentage of all $KARRAT spent go to a DAO controlled address that can’t be touched or moved without a governance vote. This would serve similar to a burn, while providing us with some flexibility. With enough community support, I believe we can make this happen!

This year has been incredible with the creation of new game modes, AI characters, and the launch of $KARRAT on Coinbase. The next chapter is starting now. Let’s continue to show and introduce the world to My Pet Hooligan.

You have heard updates about the game, the studio and partnerships including Nvidia, Palantir, ElevenLabs and also that the first LLM powered collectibles are coming your way, but today let's dig deeper into what we have been building in crypto and for the wider Web3 community!..

  
**User Accounts & Marketplace** - In the last few months we have strengthened our Web3 and UX team with new hires and have been quietly building our own infrastructure solutions with a SaaS lens, so they are structured in a way that we can deliver for others too. 

After months of investigating Web3 infrastructure and white label solutions, we decided to build our own for resilience, continuity and configurability reasons. Who knows better about what we need than ourselves? 

A first working model of our Marketplace has been developed and it allows for all My Pet Hooligan and game assets to be tradable in [$KARRAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24KARRAT&src=cashtag_click). We are also in the process of building in other features such as rental mechanisms, subscriptions and more. There are always opportunities to open up these solutions to partner collections and for other games, but we focus on our own first! 

As you know we have been developing communication processes between our Web3 Hub, PlayFab and Epic to deliver portable and connected Web3 experiences and its working! We have developed a new connected User Accounts system around this, that will be able to communicate with the game on a number of distribution platforms, not just limited to Epic but the likes of Steam, Playstation and XBox too. This is where your Web3 identity will live. 

***Which means very soon, you will have your…*** 

**NFTs in Game (Double Tap Part 2)** - Double Tap Part 1 is here and it is an absolute blast, but Double Tap Part 2 is coming soon and with that you get your OG Hooligan NFTs back in the game! Things are on-track for this build by PAX West and soon after you will once again be able to play with your very own Hooligans and resume your identities again! Double Tap Part 2 is coming and PAX West is going to be a Hooligan takeover! 

**StreetKred** - If you don't already know, StreetKred is our upcoming User Acquisition and Rewards system. This system will have touchpoints in and outside of the game, to account for the various different types of community members, not just for gamers. The intention is to not only limit this to the My Pet Hooligan ecosystem, but for other AMGI Studio products too. We do have a working StreetKred system, but we are continuing to develop the sustainability aspects of the model. This is one of the most important components of what we are developing and needs a lot of modeling, number crunching and scenario testing before it goes live. 

**WinVote** - It now has a name! AMGI Studios has developed a proprietary on-chain governance, proposal and voting system as a response to a lack of market solutions that provide cost effective, user friendly and customisable experiences for communities. WinVote has been proposed to replace Tally by the KARRAT Foundation and will be made available to license to other projects in due course too. As unexciting as governance can be, this solution is a much needed addition to the industry and another exciting prospect for the studio. 

**My Pet Hooligan Tournament** - 64 teams of 4, battling it out in a Team DeathMatch tournament for big prizes and all the glory live on the front page of Twitch. Start to hone those skills, you got till September. It's gonna be intense! 

***WE ARE MY PET HOOLIGAN and My Pet Hooligan Ain’t Nuthing ta F’ Wit!..***"
