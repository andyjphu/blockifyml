Decentralized Cloud Storage: The Future of Secure and Affordable Data Management?,BlockchainStartups,1i77tnd,2025-01-22 05:03:06,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/1i77tnd/decentralized_cloud_storage_the_future_of_secure/,Rough_Play_4288,,"Traditional cloud storage solutions include Google Drive and Dropbox; these have monopolized the market for years but concurrently come with a host of drawbacks, including central control, data leakage, and high costs. Decentralized cloud storage overcomes the challenges by using blockchain and peer-to-peer networks to ensure that data management is both secure and affordable.

Filecoin, Arweave, and Storj are leading this revolution. Data is stored on a worldwide grid of nodes instead of centralized servers. No node can fail or be compromised as a single point, so the chances of some sort of outage or breach are very low. A good example is that, in the case of Filecoin, users get incentivized for renting out free storage-an incentivized, cost-effective network would scale up data storage.

Advantages on the other side include affordability: a decentralized storage platform can be considerably cheaper compared to traditional providers by cutting out middlemen. The user retains ownership of data and thus has greater privacy and control.

On the other hand, there are a number of obstacles to overcome, such as usability issues and regulatory concerns, before decentralized storage will become commonplace.

So, is decentralized cloud storage the future? At the very least, things look bright for those who take security, affordability, and control over their data seriously. Would you entrust your files to the blockchain?

restic with many very small files,restic,1i2dm8p,2025-01-15 20:35:11,5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/restic/comments/1i2dm8p/restic_with_many_very_small_files/,potato-truncheon,,"Hi there -

I'm trying to understand how restic handles large numbers of very small files (in the KB range, as opposed to the MB range).

I understand that files larger than the pack size will be split and spread across multiple packs, but I've not been able to glean whether multiple files would be grouped together to form a single pack.

Main reason for asking is that there are some storage backend that put a premium on the number of files (or segments) and I'm trying to understand the interaction with restic.

(For context, I'm currently testing out Truenas' Cloudbackup with Storj (with restic under the hood), and this is a factor.  Depending how it goes, I'd consider rolling my own restic scripts to another back end, but sometimes a canned solution has real merit - especially for something like backups where roadmaps to recovery have clear documentation for those that might need it)."

Pool import make system hang at boot & crash my system when manually imported,truenas,1hzuv9s,2025-01-12 14:37:14,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/truenas/comments/1hzuv9s/pool_import_make_system_hang_at_boot_crash_my/,yugohug0,SCALE,"Hi guys, 

After some long time lurking, I'm finally posting after an unexpected failure on my main Truenas server.

  
**Context :**

I have a used HP Proliant 8 Rack mounted server (With DDR3 ECC Memory) mainly used for personal data & medias, running without issues since 2018.

Important datasets are backed up on StorJ but Medias backup would be too expensive to do and is not so important so it was ""only"" on a RaidZ5 Array for improved resilience.

I was running this instance non-stop for a few years now, updating at newer versions when available and improving data capacity as well as replacing drives when smart or some errors were detected.

But few days ago, my server stopped during the night (May be from an automated update) or a power outage, and when it went back up it freezed at Truenas startup

**The problem :**

After some troubleshooting, I realised that the import of the pools are making Truenas stuck on boot, I manage to make it boot completely by disconnecting all of the disks from my main pool or even mount my main pool (Vault) if it's mounted in read-only, but all my data under POOL/MEDIAS/... is invisible.

Trying to import the pool using ""zpool import Vault"" start importing then reboot the server without any messages.

Is this completely unrecoverable ? (See screenshot) I tried debugging using ChatGPT but still stuck, and if the data is lost what did I did wrong ? (ECC, RaidZ5, UPS, Monthly Scrub, ...)

Thanks already for this wonderful community !

How Can I Monetize My 4090 for Passive Income? GPU Compute and Decentralized Nodes Advice Needed!,cryptomining,1hxdt49,2025-01-09 09:20:29,2,0.6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptomining/comments/1hxdt49/how_can_i_monetize_my_4090_for_passive_income_gpu/,kungabungalow,QUESTION,"Hey everyone,

I’m exploring ways to **generate passive income** with my system by running **decentralized storage nodes, compute workloads, or validator nodes.** I’m hoping to offset some of my hardware investment and get involved in decentralized projects without having to babysit the setup 24/7.

Here’s my current setup:

* **CPU:** Ryzen 7 9700X
* **GPUs:** RTX 4090 (planning to use this for GPU-intensive tasks), GTX 1070 (might dedicate this to compute or as a backup).
* **RAM:** 64GB DDR4
* **Storage:** 10TB HDD (considering Storj or Filecoin), 4TB + 2TB NVMe SSDs (available for cache if needed).
* **Internet:** Upgrading to **1 Gbps fiber** soon.

# What I’m Considering:

1. **Livepeer (Video Transcoding):** Seems like a good fit for the 4090, but is it competitive enough to generate solid returns, or are people undercutting each other?
2. **Storj/Filecoin (Storage Nodes):** Would adding another **10TB HDD** significantly boost earnings, or is it better to focus on compute workloads?
3. **Golem/Render Network:** Is renting out GPUs like the 4090 a viable way to earn passive income, or is this market already too saturated?

# Questions for the Community:

* What’s a good mix of GPU and storage nodes to build a diversified, ""set-it-and-forget-it"" passive income setup?
* Are there any **validator nodes** or decentralized hosting services that work well with a setup like this?
* Any tips for managing bandwidth-heavy workloads so I don’t slow down the entire house?

I know this isn’t a ""get rich quick"" kind of thing, but I’d appreciate any advice from people who’ve run similar setups!

Thanks for your insights!"

I’m familiar with traditional mining, but since that’s not viable anymore, I’m looking at other decentralized workloads like **Livepeer**, **Golem**, or **Vast.ai**.

Here’s my current setup:

* **CPU:** Ryzen 7 9700X
* **GPUs:** RTX 4090 (primary GPU), GTX 1070 (spare—open to suggestions on how to use it).
* **RAM:** 64GB DDR4
* **Storage:** 10TB HDD (already thinking of running Storj), NVMe SSDs for caching if needed.
* **Internet:** Upgrading to **1 Gbps fiber** soon.

# What I’m Considering:

1. **Livepeer (Video Transcoding):** I’ve heard some people earn decent returns, but what’s a good `pricePerUnit` to attract jobs without giving my compute away for nothing?
2. **Golem/Render Network:** Is it realistic to rent out a 4090 and actually make passive income, or would I be out-competed by bigger farms?
3. **Vast.ai:** I’ve seen people rent their GPUs through Vast.ai—would I be better off setting competitive pricing here vs running nodes like Livepeer?

# Extra Question:

Any tips for managing bandwidth-heavy GPU tasks while living with family? I’m planning to upgrade to **1 Gbps**, but curious if I should use **QoS settings or dual connections** to avoid bogging down the whole house.

I’m not expecting massive profits overnight—I just want to make the most of the hardware I have and offset some of the costs. Any suggestions on how to set up a reliable, passive income stream would be awesome!

"Adding partitioned Special VDEV, SLOG and L2ARC via CLI",truenas,1hwyvkh,2025-01-08 18:49:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/truenas/comments/1hwyvkh/adding_partitioned_special_vdev_slog_and_l2arc/,BackgroundSky1594,SCALE,"!!Edited to make things work!!

~~TLDR: Are these commands fine or am I overlooking something important?~~  
My Plan is to partition two 1.6TB SSDs with sfdisk like so:

    echo 'label: gpt' | sfdisk /dev/nvme0n1
    
    echo 'label: gpt' | sfdisk /dev/nvme2n1
    
    
    cat <<'EOL' | sfdisk /dev/nvme0n1
    size=600GiB
    size=64GiB
    +
    EOL
    
    cat <<'EOL' | sfdisk /dev/nvme2n1
    size=600GiB
    size=64GiB
    +
    EOL

And then i should be able to add the partitions like so:

    zpool add -f bigSpin special mirror /dev/nvme0n1p1 /dev/nvme2n1p1
    zpool add bigSpin log mirror /dev/nvme0n1p2 /dev/nvme2n1p2
    zpool add bigSpin cache /dev/nvme0n1p3 /dev/nvme2n1p3

Background:

After around 8 months (and now that fast\_dedup is merged) I've decided I want to add a Special VDEV to my pool.  
Apart from faster recursive directory listings it's primarily meant for the DDT table for UrBackup.

* System: Epyc 7551P with 256GB ECC RAM.
* Pool: 8 drive RaidZ2 using 16TB Exos disks
* Workload: Mostly SMB for Media, my Nextcloud data directory, two Storj nodes expected to grow in the future and UrBackup once i get the specials setup
* Tunables: 300 second txg window, 32GB dirty\_data\_max

For Apps/VM disks I'm using a 2x2 ZFS Mirror with 1.92TB SATA SSDs (Toshiba Enterprise ones). So the large pool isn't too performance critical.

I was originally looking for: 100k 4k randw IOPS, 800GB capacity (\~1% of the usable pool), PLP and decent TBW. Optane with more than 600GB is just too expensive for me...  
Due to eBay pricing I've ended up with 2\* 1.6TB Micron 7400 drives for 150€ since everything I could find satisfying my requirements was already \~120€, so the 7400s more than doubling every spec were just much better value.

But now I'm left with several hundred GB more than I need. I don't want a 1.6TB Special VDEV even with some small files being stored there (not from all datasets: Storj would be a waste, Media will have almost no small records) because they can't be shrunk in the future, replacing them is harder/more expensive and growing a VDEV is trivial.

I know my workload is mostly async, but I have the space so making the occasional `fsync()` fast for 4% us my drive capacity doesn't seem to bad. I also know L2ARC takes some RAM, but the alternative would be leaving a lot of SSD space unused, I can always tune `secondarycache` per dataset to skip caching completely irrelevant stuff. If the special VDEVs ever get even close to full i can always drop SLOG and L2ARC, repartition and add them back smaller (or not if I really need all the space).

Also please don't turn this into an argument about the use of dedup, I've read through basically everything on the inner workings of old and new dedup and have already tested UrBackup with several TB of data. It's faster than Gigabit, even without the special device, so it is mostly there to absorb the performance impact of loading the DDT after a reboot."

Seems to be working well, but really disappointed in the dashboard, especially after see that all of the previous month (Dec) has now disappeared. It doesn't seem like there is any configurability in the dashboard.

  
After digging around quite a bit, it looks like people have created their own solutions based on Grafana or something similar. Everything I can find also seems to be at least a couple of years old. What are the latest common practices for monitoring a Storj node? If it is still a Grafana-like approach, are there any guides for someone that doesn't have much experience with it?"

📸Looks like Reuters is beginning to leverage the immutability of DLT for trusted news.,Hedera,1hoewop,2024-12-28 15:47:24,102,1.0,9,https://i.redd.it/xwtxm0l7jn9e1.jpeg,Perfect_Ability_1190,Discussion,"More specifically there seem to be solutions from both $HBAR & $CHEQ via C2PA in this mix.

In a Proof of Concept they used digital signage for proof of authenticity with a Canon camera using a device specific key.

These keys would then log the data and attached image on-chain as the ""authentic"" version.

This is the EXACT use case that Cheqd and the C2PA overall has been solving.

In short it's trust of information and content of real world images thanks to the authenticity of logging metadata on an immutable ledger.

It plays into everything Cheqd stands for with credentials, verifiable content, identities, etc.

Additionally Canon is actually also a part of the C2PA, so the aligned goals are certainly visible.

It's very likely that we also see a trust registry set up for this to ensure trusted entities are registered & verified.

This is the exact same solution Cheqd has been providing to names like the GAN & even EU Sandbox.

Trust Registries are becoming a common standard for trusted entities for data & Cheqd's been leading the way with global leaders.

On the other hand we can see that logs of information in this Proof of Concept was logged onto Hedera!

This actually isn't the first time we've seen Hedera be used for truth of information in media.

We've also seen Neuron funded by the UK Govt back in 2021 leverage drones for security of information.

Beyond just Reuters, Canon & C2PA this collaboration also directly featured Starling Labs.

Starling has built on Hedera with the same aligned goal of data integrity & using DLT to securely capture, store & verify human history.

So to see Starling Labs here collaborating with Reuters says quite a lot about the continued success in growth of real utilities building on Hedera.

It's great to see Hedera's further being used for trust of information & what better chain to do so for real world purposes?

After all just look at their governance council, those are the names validating consensus on data.
––––––––––––––––––––––

Misinformation is more rampant than ever and it's only going to grow exponentially with AI in the mix.

Cheqd & Hedera don't just have experience in providing solutions for truth in this field... They're pioneering this vertical with industry leaders.

Cheqd's collaboration in groups like C2PA & GAN have connected them to leading names in media like Adobe, Accenture & more.

Hedera's work in trusted information is visible in names like Starling Labs, Neuron and just about anything that leverages Hedera Consensus Service.

An immutable ledger of trusted information, it's one of the most fundamental promises of blockchain.🔐
