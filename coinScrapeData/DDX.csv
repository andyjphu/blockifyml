What other   exchanges can these crypto be traded (buy/sell) in US?  Is the only option wallet; if so which ones? Thanks

6 Ethereum Altcoins Targeted By SEC Ahead of Coinbase Wells Notice,CryptoCurrency,11zq6gl,2023-03-23 12:51:45,24,0.8,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11zq6gl/6_ethereum_altcoins_targeted_by_sec_ahead_of/,Sporesword,GENERAL-NEWS,"""The coins in question are Amp ([AMP](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/amp-token/)), LCX ([LCX](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/lcx/)), Power Ledger ([POWR](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/power-ledger/)), Rally ([RLY](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/rly/)), XYO Network ([XYO](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/xyo-network/)) and DerivaDAO ([DDX](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/derivadao/)).

At the time, Coinbase strongly [rejected](https://dailyhodl.com/2022/07/22/coinbase-rejects-sec-claim-that-nine-ethereum-based-altcoins-are-securities/)  the claim that the above crypto assets are securities, citing its  “rigorous” and “SEC-reviewed” process for determining which assets are  listed on the exchange.

Today, the SEC [sent](https://dailyhodl.com/2023/03/22/coinbase-receives-sec-wells-notice-over-listed-crypto-assets-staking-service-coinbase-prime-and-coinbase-wallet/)  a Wells Notice to Coinbase, asserting the agency has made a preliminary  determination that recommends the agency file an enforcement action  against Coinbase.""

Sounds to me that a legal analysis of the SEC's review needs to take place to prepare Coinbase for a lawsuit against the agency. If it turns out that the SEC signed off on any of these \*tokens as being acceptable then the agency is eventually going to get itself investigated by a special prosecutor.

\*SEC reviewed the process for selecting assets, though, one would think this lead to a lot of information sharing and discussion between the SEC, Coinbase's lawyers, and technical staff during this review process which would lock down criteria and even if the SEC didn't officially ""sign off"" on the final draft their participation lends the process some legal credibility.

## Macroeconomic headwinds favor scarce assets

Some analysts attribute the crypto market strength to China’s lower-than-expected gross domestic product data, causing investors to expect further expansionary measures by policymakers. China’s economy expanded 0.4% in the second quarter versus the previous year, as the country continued to struggle with self-imposed restrictions to curb another outbreak of COVID-19 infections, according to CNBC.

The United Kingdom's 9.4% inflation in June marked a 40-year high, and to supposedly aid the population, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi announced a $44.5 billion (GBP 37 billion) assistance package for vulnerable families.

Under these circumstances, Bitcoin reversed its downtrend as policymakers scrambled to solve the seemingly impossible problem of slowing economies amid ever-increasing government debt.

However, the cryptocurrency sector faces its own issues, including regulatory uncertainties. For instance, on July 21, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labeled nine tokens as 'crypto assets securities' thus not only falling under the regulatory body's purview but liable for having failed to register with it.

Expressly, the SEC referred to Powerledger (POWR), Kromatika (KROM), DFX Finance (DFX), Amp (AMP), Rally (RLY), Rari Governance Token (RGT), DerivaDAO (DDX), LCX, and XYO. The regulator brought  charges agains a former Coinbase products manager for ""insider trading"" after they allegedly used non-public information for personal benefit.

Currently, Bitcoin investors face too much uncertainty despite the seemingly helpful macroeconomic backdrop, which should favor scarce assets such as BTC. For this reason, an analysis of derivatives data is valuable in understanding whether investors are pricing higher odds of a downturn.

## Pro traders remain skeptical of price recovery

Retail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Still, they are professional traders' preferred instruments because they prevent the perpetual fluctuation of contracts' funding rates.

These fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets because investors demand more money to withhold the settlement. But this situation is not exclusive to crypto markets, so futures should trade at a 4% to 10% annualized premium in healthy markets."
