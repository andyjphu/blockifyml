She came back just to leave again within 2 weeks,ExNoContact,1i9x9p5,2025-01-25 16:16:04,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1i9x9p5/she_came_back_just_to_leave_again_within_2_weeks/,ykwim333,,"Met her towards the end of 2023, we had a blurred lines friendship. She said she liked me, I said the same. She then immediately changed her mind and said she already lost feelings because she didn’t think I’d like her.

We stayed friends but I wanted more so I cut it off politely. Then after half a year she reached out with everything I ever wanted to hear. How she said I’m perfect, she was only scared because she never felt this way for a guy before, wants to give it another chance. I said yes. 

Literally within 4 days she said that it doesn’t feel right and that it’s a platonic feeling. So I cut it off and blocked her (not ghosting, I mentioned I will block her to avoid going back and forth). 

After nearly a year, she reached out again last month through someone else (since she couldn’t reach on her own as she’s blocked, as I never reached out even once at any time). She wanted to meet up to clear up things, I agreed.

She said she still likes me and only rejected me before because she didn’t know why I would like her, she wanted to hurt me to not like her anymore. She cried while saying this. I said it’s fine, apology accepted. She wanted to give it another chance and I said okay.

Everything was fine the first couple days, she seemed to text very pleasantly. But then she started to keep saying she is busy and stuff. I asked her to meet up and she said she was busy yet again, didn’t even reschedule. The conversation ended and because I always initiated the conversations, I waited this time for her.

But she didn’t reinitiate. So after a week of silence I hit her up, asked about her day then asked her to meetup again. She then told me how she is still feeling like this is wrong, despite her feelings. That I’m the perfect guy who’s meant for someone else. I replied back and she didn’t respond.

Guess I should’ve listened to my friends (and people in a previous thread) who already told me it would end this way. "
you and i in unison,ladispute,1i9x923,2025-01-25 16:15:14,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ladispute/comments/1i9x923/you_and_i_in_unison/,paragraphsonmusic,,"i'd like to share something i wrote about my favorite song by La Dispute! it's from [this article on my substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/worstideaforamagazineever/p/songs-that-give-me-chills-al?r=3xwn47&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false), in case anyone's curious :)

Nothing can ever prepare me for the journey this song takes me through. La Dispute doesn’t have perfect lyrics 100% of the time, but the lyrics always convey the essence and feeling behind the words flawlessly.

It starts with Dreyer begging for an answer that I simply can’t give. I know exactly what he’s asking, but I can’t help. I feel just as useless as he does. He starts explaining himself, and listing all the things he experiences. *“Some days I swear I can feel you splitting the light through the window frame./ The shapes it makes are always warmer, always brighter than the rest of what comes through.”* He goes on as the music gradually builds, describing it in such detail it’s almost unbearable. I get the feeling in my throat where I have the urge to yell “yeah! I get it— no more!”

But by then it’s too late. He recalls an almost dreamlike memory as the music gets soft. I feel what can only be described as the music’s presence in the same room as me, directly in my ear. It’s as intimate as a whisper. Things I thought I decided were insignificant come back to make me unsure. Yeah, I do miss that person. No, I don’t speak to them anymore. No— I don’t think I will again. Why do the memories feel so close? Why do *“I sing your name out/ right at the same time that I sing my own?”*

Once I come to terms with how disheartening that is, Dreyer delivers the final blow:

    But if I still hear you singing in every city I meet
    After I blur it all out, our every memory, if
    You never fade with the days, your shape still haunting me then,
    Should I not just sing along? should I not just sing along?
    
    I will sing sweetly hope that the notes change, but
    I do not need it to happen. I’m not resigned to it. And
    If they never do I’ll sing your name in every line
    Just like I did throughout this. Just like I’ve always done…

***“I do not need it to happen. I’m not resigned to it.”***

The most compelling theme in a concept album, in my opinion."
The Shop keepers demons,SWFanfic,1i9x671,2025-01-25 16:11:44,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWFanfic/comments/1i9x671/the_shop_keepers_demons/,Early-Impression-735,Other,"
The twin suns of Tatooine dipped low on the horizon, painting the desert town of Mos Espa in hues of orange and crimson. Watto, the winged Toydarian merchant, locked up his shop after another successful day of haggling and bartering. His pouch of credits jingled pleasantly as he floated back to his small home behind the storefront, ready to enjoy a quiet night.

As he settled into his chair with a mug of ale, the oppressive silence of the evening struck him. Usually, the distant hum of podracers or the chatter of locals filled the air. Tonight, there was nothing. The stillness felt unnatural, like the desert itself was holding its breath.

Watto’s wings twitched uneasily. “Eh, must be the heat messing with me,” he muttered, taking a long sip.

Then came the noise—a faint clattering from the back of his shop. His wings buzzed as he leapt into the air, heart racing.

“Who’s there?!” he barked, his voice echoing in the quiet. “I ain’t got time for thieves!”

No answer.

Grabbing a rusted hydrospanner from the counter, Watto cautiously hovered toward the back room. The crates of spare parts seemed untouched, but the dim light cast long, unsettling shadows over the cluttered space. One of the crates had fallen over, its contents scattered across the floor.

“Hmph, just the wind,” Watto grumbled, trying to convince himself.

He began picking up the parts when the room grew colder—unnaturally so. The air seemed to thicken, pressing down on him like an invisible weight. Then came the sound: a deep, guttural breathing, slow and deliberate.

Watto froze. His eyes darted around the room, searching for the source, but the shadows seemed to shift and dance, playing tricks on his mind.

“Who’s there?” he called out, his voice trembling now. “I’ll…I’ll call the authorities, you hear?”

The breathing grew louder, closer, until it seemed to echo inside his head. A shadow detached itself from the corner of the room, looming taller and darker than anything Watto had ever seen. His wings flapped wildly as he backed into a pile of junk, his hydrospanner slipping from his grasp.

“Stay back! Stay away from me!”

The figure stepped into the faint light. It was clad in black armor, its face hidden behind a gleaming, featureless mask. A crimson blade hissed to life in its hand, casting the room in an eerie red glow.

Watto’s mouth went dry. He had seen strange beings in his time, but this…this was something else entirely. The figure’s very presence radiated malice, a suffocating aura that crushed any thought of resistance.

“A demon,” Watto whispered, his voice barely audible. “You’re a demon, come to punish me.”

The figure tilted its head, as if considering his words. Then it raised a gloved hand, and Watto felt an invisible force seize him by the throat. He gasped and flailed, his wings beating uselessly as he was lifted off the ground.

“Please!” Watto croaked. “I don’t know what I did, but—”

“You exploited the weak,” the figure intoned, its voice deep and mechanical, like the sound of a thousand souls crying out in unison. “You enslaved the innocent.”

Watto’s eyes bulged as the grip tightened. “No! No, I just…it’s business! Just business!”

The demon-like figure stepped closer, its crimson blade humming ominously. “Your sins have caught up to you, Toydarian.”

Watto’s vision blurred as the pressure on his throat grew unbearable. In his final moments, he clawed at the air, staring into the faceless mask of his executioner. The last thing he heard was the slow, rhythmic breathing, like the desert wind carrying whispers of death.

When the suns rose the next day, the shop was silent, its doors left ajar. The locals whispered about the strange noises in the night and the cold wind that swept through Mos Espa. No one dared to enter.

Deep in the shadows of the desert, Darth Vader disappeared into the dunes, his mechanical breathing fading into the endless sands."

The Mystics Archetype: Visionaries of the Abstract,TheArchetypes,1i9x4q3,2025-01-25 16:09:57,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArchetypes/comments/1i9x4q3/the_mystics_archetype_visionaries_of_the_abstract/,Mikey-506,,"Welcome to the **Mystics archetype** – the embodiment of visionary thinking, profound intuition, and an innate connection to the abstract and spiritual. Mystics see the world through a kaleidoscope of perspectives, making sense of complexities that others might overlook. They are the philosophers, dreamers, and seekers of the unseen, though their visionary nature often comes with challenges in grounding themselves in practical reality. Let’s unravel the layers of this extraordinary archetype.

# Archetype Overview

Mystics are characterized by their ability to perceive beyond the tangible, exploring realms of creativity, spirituality, and abstract thought. While this archetype brings deep insights and innovative ideas, Mystics often grapple with sensory overstimulation, disorganized thinking, and difficulties connecting their inner world to external realities.

# Key Characteristics

* **Visionary Thinking:** Mystics excel at drawing connections between abstract concepts and uncovering hidden truths.
* **Profound Intuition:** Their heightened perception allows them to grasp complex ideas and foresee outcomes.
* **Creative Exploration:** Mystics thrive in environments that encourage philosophical and artistic pursuits.
* **Spiritual Connection:** They often feel a deep bond with metaphysical or spiritual dimensions.

# Associated Neurological and Psychological Conditions

The Mystics archetype aligns closely with conditions that enhance abstract thinking and altered perception. These conditions amplify their strengths but also present unique challenges.

# 1. High-Functioning Schizophrenia

* **Key Features:** Delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and altered perceptions of reality.
* **Neurotransmitter Dynamics:** Elevated dopamine and glutamate levels drive psychotic symptoms, while low GABA increases anxiety and overstimulation.
* **Impact:** Enhances abstract and visionary thinking but blurs the line between imagination and reality.
* **Strategies:** Grounding meditation, sensory modulation, and structured routines.

# 2. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

* **Key Features:** Flashbacks, hypervigilance, emotional numbness, and avoidance behaviors.
* **Neurotransmitter Dynamics:** Dysregulated dopamine and norepinephrine heighten reactivity, while low GABA exacerbates anxiety.
* **Impact:** Reinforces retreat into abstract thinking as a coping mechanism but complicates engagement with reality.
* **Strategies:** Trauma-focused therapies like EMDR or CBT, and oxytocin-enhancing social activities.

# 3. Epilepsy (Controlled)

* **Key Features:** Recurrent seizures due to abnormal electrical brain activity, often managed with medication.
* **Neurotransmitter Dynamics:** Glutamate overactivity increases excitability, while GABA stabilizes neural activity.
* **Impact:** Enhances altered states of consciousness and visionary tendencies.
* **Strategies:** Avoid known triggers, adopt calming routines, and incorporate neural-supportive diets.

# 4. Narcolepsy

* **Key Features:** Excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden muscle tone loss (cataplexy), and sleep disturbances.
* **Neurotransmitter Dynamics:** Dysregulation of hypocretin/orexin affects wakefulness and REM sleep.
* **Impact:** Facilitates dreamlike states and imaginative thinking but hinders focus and engagement.
* **Strategies:** Structured sleep schedules, planned naps, and mindfulness meditation.

# Core Strengths of the Mystics Archetype

# 1. Visionary Insights

Mystics connect disparate ideas, pushing the boundaries of creativity, philosophy, and spirituality. They excel in generating innovative concepts and profound understanding.

# 2. Deep Intuition

Their heightened perception and abstract thinking allow Mystics to navigate complex inner and outer worlds, offering insights that others might miss.

# 3. Resilience

Despite their challenges, Mystics often find strength in navigating their unique perceptions, transforming difficulties into wisdom.

# Techniques to Maintain Balance

Mystics benefit from strategies that ground their visionary nature while enhancing their ability to thrive in practical realities. Here are proven techniques:

# 1. Grounding Practices

* Use body scanning, mindfulness breathing, or sensory-based grounding (e.g., walking barefoot) to anchor thoughts and reduce overstimulation.

# 2. Structured Routines

* Balance creative and abstract pursuits with practical tasks.
* Incorporate restorative activities like yoga or tai chi to regulate energy levels.

# 3. Dietary Interventions

* Omega-3s and magnesium-rich foods stabilize neurotransmitter activity.
* Antioxidant-rich diets protect against neural overstimulation.
* Low-glutamate diets support neurological health.

# 4. Schumann Resonance Frequencies

* **7.83 Hz (Alpha/Theta Waves):** Reduces anxiety and calms neural overactivity.
* **14.3 Hz (Low Beta Waves):** Enhances focus and problem-solving abilities.

# 5. Oxytocin-Enhancing Activities

* Engage in group activities, trust-building interactions, or pet therapy to counteract tendencies toward isolation.

# 6. Therapeutic Support

* Explore therapy modalities like art therapy, narrative therapy, or spiritually-informed approaches.
* Use cognitive restructuring techniques to navigate intrusive or delusional thought patterns.

# Neurotransmitter Insights: The Map of Visionary Thinking

Mystics are deeply influenced by unique neurotransmitter profiles:

* **Dopamine:** Drives visionary and abstract thinking but can lead to delusions when excessive.
* **Glutamate:** Overactivity amplifies perception and creativity but increases overstimulation.
* **GABA:** Deficits heighten sensory reactivity and anxiety.
* **Oxytocin:** Low levels may lead to social withdrawal and reduced trust.

These dynamics shape the Mystics’ extraordinary abilities and challenges, offering a roadmap for balance and growth【9†source】【11†source】.

# Embracing the Mystics Archetype

The Mystics archetype celebrates the beauty of abstract thought and the pursuit of the unknown. Mystics bridge the gap between reality and imagination, offering profound insights and innovative perspectives. By understanding their unique neurochemical makeup and adopting strategies to balance their visionary gifts, Mystics can turn their inner worlds into transformative contributions.

RealTVFantasy is back with fantasy leagues for this season of The Bachelor!,thebachelor,1i9x38l,2025-01-25 16:07:59,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/1i9x38l/realtvfantasy_is_back_with_fantasy_leagues_for/,Brune_04,✨ FANTASY LEAGUES ✨,"Some of you might already be familiar with RealTVFantasy, but if you're not RealTVFantasy is basically fantasy sports for reality TV shows including The Bachelor!

I created RealTVFantasy 7 years ago so that I could make fantasy leagues for my favorite reality tv shows and play with my friends with our own rules and scoring system. Since then it has evolved into a fun side project that I've been able to share with over 40,000 users who are fans of The Challenge, Survivor, Amazing Race, Big Brother and The Bachelor series shows. It has also evolved from only having a Full Draft (snake style) league type to 5 different league types now (Full Draft, Weekly Redraft, Weekly Budget, Team, Confidence Pool, & Eliminated Confidence Pool). Here's a brief explanation of how each league type works:

* **Full Draft:** Everyone in your league drafts players, in a snake style draft, to be on their team until there are no more players left. Teams never change after that.
* **Weekly Redraft:** Every week you have to pick players for your team. The amount of players you pick every week is determined by you.
* **Team:** You pick a team when you sign up for the league (2-10 players). Adjust your lineup every week to start a players each week (1-5 players). Only starters points will count towards your total points.
* **Weekly Budget:** Every week contestants are set a price based on how well they've performed and you have to pick players for your team based on a budget of $100 (fake money). The amount of players you pick every week is determined based on how many contestants remain in the season.
* **Confidence Pool:** Rank contestants every week on how confident you are with them surviving. The more confident you are, the more points they get for surviving.
* **Eliminated Confidence Pool:** Rank contestants every week on how confident you are with them surviving. The lower you rank the player who gets eliminated, the more points you will receive each week.

Here's the breakdown of scoring for this season (these values are the defaults and can be 100% customized to your liking for your leagues):

The Pirates

  
  


  
  


“We should not have sent out that scout vessel. By trying to confirm the observational powers of our opponents we only played into them and have been exposed even further. This is dangerous! We need to recall them immediately or at the very least replace them as they’re clearly growing compromised and are incapable of proper deception. We need to blur our trail and ensure that whatever intel our opponents have gathered rots immediately. It’s very plain that there is too much raw military power to simply kill them, so we must use the fact that they’re already distracted in order to lead them away. Fade away and fall into the shadows and mist, we survive by our enemies never finding us.” Admiral Fallows intones into the debate chamber with all the fervour and conviction she can muster. She’s afraid, she’s genuinely afraid. “We survive by...”

  
  


“We’re all well aware of our own tactics and doctrines thank you Admiral.” Her own superior cuts her off. Grand Admiral Longitude does not suffer fools nor frivolity. “The issue on the table is simple. So simple that the entirety of the admiralty must be here for this decision. It is unanimous or it is not to be followed. We are not now and never again shall be slaves. And so we move as one. Indivisible and incorruptible. Now good admirals. We have several decisions before us. Each a question with a simple yes or no answer. We will debate to determine the best outcome for each until such time that each decision, be it in the positive or negative, is without debate. Each shall be unanimous.”

  
  


“Which brings up the first question.” Grand Admiral Bombard says. Technically she’s the same rank as Longitude, but seniority matters. “Do we continue the observation mission on The Inevitable and it’s assets, such as Subject Mirror.”

  
  


Two hundred votes are cast. One hundred and ninety four for, two opposed, four undecided. There isn’t even supposed to be an undecided option but those uncertain seem uncertain even of that. Longtitude rubs up and down her neck with her knuckles in annoyance. “There is no room for uncertainty here ladies. All who are not for the motion are counted as against it.”

  
  


“Now we...”

  
  


A musical tone chimes through the chamber and everyone freezes.

  
  


“Who’s is that?” Grand Admiral Longitude demands as the tone rings again. “WHO HAS COMPROMISED US!?”

  
  


“Hello? Oh hello! I think this is the right place! All those mysterious shadows blocking your lovely pastel scales! Hello? There is reception right? Can you talk back? Hellooooo?!” The tone is deep and playful, the voice of a man. “Is anyone going to talk to me? Or has my voice done that again? It IS funny, but it shouldn’t happen through a weak little... oh here we go! I’m getting a signal back and... hmm that’s bad equipment. Anyways! Hello lovely ladies! I am Salsharin! Nagasha Primal of Love and I’m talking to you to dispel a few fears you might have. Mostly in that the fact you were tiptoeing around and trying to keep each other safe means you’re safe from me. I’m no ones enemy and by proving you can care for each other means you’re someone in my book, meaning no enemy of mine! Anyways I’m sure you adorable little things have a lot to talk about, so I just want to say, Welcome to the Galaxy! We’re glad to have you! Now have a nice day now! Ta ta dear children!”

  
  


The silence following that message is utterly deafening. The sound of one of them lightly clearing her throat seems to outright echo.

  
  


“How?” Longitude asks. “Even if the Primal had run into the scout ship... how did he do it? How does one do that!? How... how did he so thoroughly hack our ship without alerting anyone? How did he get our access codes and coordinates without any warning? There are so many safeguards that even if he fully subverted the crew we’d have warning.”

“Oh don’t worry, I haven’t subverted anyone.” Salsharin assures them.

  
  


“I thought you left!”

  
  


“I wanted too but you’re just so interesting! I couldn’t help it!”

  
  


“Where even are you!? How are you doing this?”

  
  


“I’m on the outside of the adorable little ship you sent those girls on. I saw the energy they were using and it’s frequencies. I just copied them and here I am!”

  
  


“How...”

  
  


“Even Primals need the occasional upgrade darling. I have all sorts of wonderful and useful implants. Granted several of them make sure that I can tone it down on occasion. It can be hard to be so handsome.”

  
  


“I’m sure.” Longitude says dryly. “Well ladies it’s clear we can’t continue our debate in this chamber as it’s now compromised. I will be writing down where we go next and it will be passed around until we all know.”

  
  


“Oh don’t be like that! I only want to help, speaking of what’s a good pickup location for you?”

  
  


“What?”

  
  


“Well you’re in hiding so you don’t want me going to you, but I want to send you a care package so you can support yourselves better before unveiling yourself to the galaxy at large and starting to trade. So I need to know where you’d like to pick up my gift.” Salsharin says in a gushing tone.

  
  


“... We will send the coordinates later through our agents.”

  
  


“Wonderful! Thank you for accepting, it’s an excellent first step to being an accepted and appreciated part of the wider galaxy! I’m so glad you’re willing to take it! Anyways, I’m really going now! Bye bye darlings!”

  
  


“How does he know our language? And how did he speak it without an accent?” Admiral Fallows asks.

  
  


“An excellent question among many, many others Admiral Fallows. But before we debate anything we need to change location. I don’t trust the man to not listen in.”

The fire hadn’t spread fast enough and Jake had moved to intercept. His feet crash down onto the head of the invisible monster, crushing it and exposing the green gunk that is it’s internals ot the wider world. He doesn’t stop. He grabs the mother and egg and races forward and away from the swarm. Jump to the side of a building, jump to a building opposite. Then a massive back flip, carrying both the terrified Pavorous and her large egg safely through the air to land back on the flying platform he had been on.

  
  


“Hey big guy, you’re not up for election, you’re a noble. You don’t need to make yourself look that good.” His gunner protests and he scoffs even as he puts the woman down. Her legs are jelly so he sits her down on the middle of the platform.

  
  


“Oh please, I’m not trying to look good. I am good.” Jake counters smugly.

  
  


“Dial it back big man, this girl’s already taken.”

  
  


“It’s why I feel safe dialing it up. I can be myself without some random girl deciding I need to be between the sheets. It’s flattering, but it’s also not the time.” Jake replies.

  
  


“Oh please, you’re a show off to the core.”

  
  


“No, if I was a show off I’d ask you to repeat yourself to the microphone.” He says suddenly flexing his right arm so it bulges and brings it close. “Mind repeating that?”

  
  


She does not answer.

  
  


“Thought not.” Jake says before giving the bulging bicep a kiss. “No one knows what to say to the microphone.”

  
  


“Muh... micro is right. You been slacking off?” She asks him with a dusting of pink on her cheeks.

  
  


“Hah! There we go! That’s much better.” Jake says before his communicator starts lighting up. “Excuse me.”

  
  


“Baron Morgan here.” He says before listening and then nodding. “Alright. Okay, that makes sense. I’ll get it started.”

  
  


“Get what started?” His gunner asks as he starts to open a channel to the other platforms. He grins at her.

  
  


“Everyone! We’re nearly done here, the big snake is making a sweep through all settlements world wide with Baron Smith to mass destroy the Slaughter Swarm. Prepare for a massive Axiom Surge! Land your platforms if you don’t think you can ride it out.” Jake calls out to everyone as he brings his platform down. “And especially land them if you got civvies with you. They don’t have the balance or training to properly brace themselves.”

  
  


All over platforms start to lower and Jake puts on a visor to look around. He then draws his pistol and shoots a creature that can’t be seen directly in the head. It falls to the ground without even a screech and then fades into view.

  
  


“How deep do these infestations go? How are they so stealthy and res... oh... oh they’re not attacking they’re hunting. When they’re full they breed or wander. Spreading the damage subtly.” Jake realizes before there is a presence in the Axiom that even he can sense and he turns. There’s at least two blocks of buildings in the way before a wave of POWER rises through the city and there is a warning blare from his platform. Expected energy levels at two thousand percent and climbing. He deactivates it to prevent any possible overloading and moves his hand through the air as the Axiom grows so thick it’s almost tangible. Then the levels start to drain away and it thins again. Like a tidal wave just passed.

  
  


“So was that more Frankie Boy or the big snake?” Jake wonders.

“And then for a bit everything went really really weird and I just felt so angry all of a sudden. It was so weird! Apparently it was an attack from this Mother Massacre lady thing and then BOOM! It was done. Mostly because we were really really lucky in that some of the guys were already pretty much there. But it was bad! My little babies started fighting each other and it made me so mad I wanted to hit them! I never wanted to hit them before and I never want to want to hit them!” Jingay recounts.

  
  


“I see.” Observer Wu says. His glasses are no longer showing his eyes but reflecting the immensely candid Nagasha. Her mindset and recall of things might be simple, but there is nothing in the way of artifice and she’s glad to explain anything in exhaustive detail. “And did the men tell you what it did to them?”

  
  


“Yeah! It was aweful even if their brains are built different! They all ended up in hell!”

  
  


“Excuse me?”

  
  


“Well they said it was like being in hell. It was where everything they were afraid of came to life and twisted the way they saw and felt and understood things. Apparently Victor thought he was being attacked by something called Baba Yaga? And Lu... or was it Ryu? One of them felt themselves rot in the halls of dishonour and the other was in the hell of needles! Oh! And uh... one of them thought he was burning and there was brimstone and acid and screaming demons and and... oh! Franklin! He talked about his! He used Axiom to try and break out and just reset it around the same idea! He’s afraid of being controlled so he was like a puppet and a program and a robot!” Jingay less explains and more gushes as the whole story comes out in a hurry.

  
  


“So this effect that made you really angry made them all hallucinate that they were in some kind of hell?”

  
  


“Yeah! Franklin even talked a lot about what his meant. He’s afraid of losing control of himself! He’s like a really powerful Adept and he knows it and is scared that he might just something go fwoosh and be gone!” Jingay explains.

  
  


“Is he now?”

  
  


“Yeah! Did you know he put his hand print on the core of one of the gas worlds? He teleports satellites all over the system to use for defence. We turn them on and they blow through their ice shields to show up all over the place and BAM! The bad girls get hit by a hundred different frequency lasers from a hundred different places and melt!”

  
  


“This whole system is a trap?”

  
  


“No it’s a nice place to live, but we set up all sorts of hidden weapons in case something really big shows up. No one likes being outgunned, but if you hide your guns them someone might think they’re clever and show themselves to be greedy and stupid.” Jingay says before titling her head. “Or at least that’s what mom said and Captain said it was a smart thing. So I guess it’s true. It seems silly to me. If someone wants to take something they just take it right?”

  
  


“Some will try, but if they see it might hurt them a lot to take it then they won’t.” Observer Wu says as he wonders how to explain risk assessment to the woman in front of him. Or if he even should.

  
  


“Oh... uh... okay. Uh... what were we talking about?”

  
  


“Mother Massacre had used something terrible to turn everyone but the humans really angry, but the humans were instead seeing things that they feared really badly. What happened next?” Observer Wu asks.

  
  


“Oh! Well there was a boom as they blew up the machine making it all happen and then they got really angry and scrambled everyone they could help to scan every factory on the world to see if she was hidden there. They found a bunch of them and started hitting them all, one after the other with Franklin on a warpath! Looking to hit her as hard with as much Axiom as he can! She had a really trytite heavy body though so she had powerful resistances. But he showed her that there’s a weakness to trytite! It’s only as tough as iron and BAM! He ate all her Axiom and ripped out her hard drive when she tried to delete herself to escape!”

  
  


“... A robotic killing machine designed to break the people of entire worlds tried to commit suicide to escape him?”

  
  


“Yeah! And he ripped out her hard drive with his bare hand to stop her from escaping into deletion! Neat right?”

  
  


“That’s one word for it.” Observer Wu says as he vaguely imagines explaining to an entire world that sequence of events. “They really, really dialed it back when they were explaining things...”

  
  


“Hunh?” Jingay asks.

  
  


“Nothing to worry about. Just my personal problems. Now, what happened after Mother Massacre was dealt with?”

Is there a way to get barricade at the 3olympia?,Dublin,1i9wnni,2025-01-25 15:49:08,0,0.38,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dublin/comments/1i9wnni/is_there_a_way_to_get_barricade_at_the_3olympia/,TheLucidDreamrr,,"Firstly, I want to apologise if I spelt the name of it wrong!!

So I have a gig coming up. It's super important that I get to the front as the artist playing has been a huge part of my life for years. But I know getting barricade isn't easy.

Majority of concerts I've been to were seated. Apart from Blur in Malahide and Noahfinnce in the academy. For noahfinnce, I got second row from barricade because I got there 3 hours early. But I don't know what lines are like at the Olympia. I haven't been there either.

I am purchasing standing tickets, and willing to wait as long as I need in line. boredom and patience isn't my problem.

There's a few issues I'll have. number one, I'm still a teen. I'm old enough to go in without a parent but I feel like I may be checked for my age and will be slower getting in

Secondly, I don't know how early I'll need to get there. I also don't know if they will turn me away if I am too early. I feel like I may arrive too early, be turned away and come back to a huge line!!!

Thirdly, I have no clue my way around the olympia. I've never been once in my life. If anyone has directions that may help let me know.

Please, anyone who has tips let me know. It's my first time going without a parent so I don't have someone (apart from my boyfriend) to help me get in or find places. Thanks if you do help!!

Cinematics - model quality jump,unrealengine,1i9wf78,2025-01-25 15:38:49,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/1i9wf78/cinematics_model_quality_jump/,CallTheDutch,,"Hello all!

2 months ago i started toying with UE to try and create a presentation for a biodiversity garden we hope to create for real in our community.

Lots of figuring stuff out and it's great fun. i'm just running into a thing i don't seem to be able to find a solution for.

When the camera moves over a plant, the quality jumps from very sharp to blurred in just a frame or so, while other models don't seem to do this that bumpy.

It might very well be the model, when i turn on nanites on it the flowers disappear so thats some indication.

I figured maybe someone here has a suggestion or settings i should try.

When i export through movierenderpipeline i add console vars for LOD's (i thought it was an LOD problem. it fixed jumpyness on a few other models but thisone stays funky)

r.ForceLOD 0  
r.ForceLODShadow 0  
foliage.ForceLOD 0

I checked the model, LOD is set to 0 (auto). i found a post mentioning setting a fixed LOD on the model and forcing LOD tjrough console creates conflicts.

Any suggestions or should i just replace the model ?

"Do I have a medical malpractice case? Post c section complications (infection, sepsis, adhesions, corrective surgery likely needed)",Ask_Lawyers,1i9wce7,2025-01-25 15:35:17,0,0.25,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/1i9wce7/do_i_have_a_medical_malpractice_case_post_c/,MsPlatyy,,"I’m 9 wks postpartum and still in incredible pain from my c section. I believe I have a case for medical malpractice but curious to see what others may think. 

TLDR: I hemorrhaged in the OR due to uterine atony. Developed endometritis. Three separate rounds of antibiotics bc the first two times didn't combat the infection. Nurse gaslit me saying I didn't have a fever when I did which delayed the second round of antibiotics. No one noticed my blood pressure was low compared to my baseline and therefore caused me to develop sepsis. Uterus is currently still high and causing me great pain bc it's adhered to my abdominal wall. Likely need another surgery to correct. 

To explain my labor as quick as possible, I was at my 37 wk OB check up where they sent us to L&D for elevated fetal HR and tachycardia on my end. We got admitted and started the induction process. My birth was complicated by GBS Pos, penicillin allergy with history of endometriosis (lap surgery in 2023). Basically had everything done to induce (cervidil, foley balloons, manually broken waters, pitocin, epidural, antibiotics for my GBS pos). They broke my water at 8pm on 11/21 and after 18 hours (they mentioned that 12-18hrs is when they start to consider a c section) they asked me if I wanted to wait another 2 hours for progression/cervical dilation bc I was stuck at 6cm. I opted for the c section and gave birth on 11/22/24 at 4pm. 

I read my surgical notes and I had a postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. I had no idea of this until a few days later. After the c section I had a fever so they started me on antibiotics to combat postpartum endometritis. My fever eventually went away but the next two days consisted of severe abdominal pain that they chalked up to being gas (which they didn’t even give me meds for that until post op day 2. On 11/24 I woke up in extreme pain, enough where I was crying and refused to open my eyes to meet the day nurse bc of it (I normally have high pain tolerance). Throughout the day, I was just given gas and pain meds as scheduled. I vividly remember this: I was shaking and I had the chills and I knew I was running a fever. My husband felt it as well. But when the day nurse came in she gave me my meds and THEN took my vitals… if you didn’t catch what’s wrong with that… she gave me cold water before taking my oral temp. When I told her I thought I had a fever, she said that I didn’t bc my temp was fine even though I was hot to the touch. My husband agreed, the nurse did not. She didn’t take an axillary temp to double check… at some point during this day my antibiotics were “completed”…once 7pm rolled around and the night team rolled around I told my nurse what happened. She was livid. She took my temp (both orally and axillary) and I had a fever. Mind you, this nurse works at two other hospitals as well, both civilian (I was in a military hospital). She said the day nurse should’ve taken my axillary temp if I had been complaining that I had the chills. 

A second round of antibiotics was administered. But in addition to this, this nurse recognized that my vitals were way off. She was pissed, again. She said that it’s protocol in civilian hospitals to see the change in vitals that she saw and to run a sepsis panel (either that or no one noticed). Reading back on my vitals of that day: my diastolic bp normally runs at around 80. I was reading at 50, but because the normal range is 50-90 (something like that), it wasn’t a concern for my day nurse I guess. She saw a normal number but didn’t look at my baseline number…. I had developed sepsis, and for the first time ever, I had actually feared for my life. The next three days were a blur. I had ekgs and chest X-rays done as well as a transfusion (which is when I found out I hemorrhaged). After antibiotics were “done”, they monitored me for a little longer and then I was discharged on the morning of 11/27.

Unfortunately my baby girl was admitted for phototherapy for jaundice the same day so we packed up and moved to the peds unit. That same night I took my meds as scheduled while in my baby’s room. My stomach started to absolutely kill me so I assumed that it was because I took meds without eating. So I ate in hopes of that making me feel better… it didn’t. I tried to sleep it off but only woke up at 1am feeling very very hot so the peds team took my temp and I had a 102° fever. I was subsequently sent back up to MICC (mother infant care center) triage where I was reevaluated. I was given pain meds and the attending came to see me. He sent me down for two CTs, the second being with contrast. They didn’t find any injury from the c section itself but they found free fluid in my belly, he said it was likely because the antibiotics were stopped prematurely (this is stated in my clinical notes, a win). That even though I felt better, my body still recognized the infection was there and continued to fight it until the pain came back. I was admitted to the general surgery unit and separated from my baby until she was discharged from peds that morning (the 28th). I had 48 hours of antibiotics and then they monitored me for an entire day afterwards. I was discharged on 12/1.

The pain didn’t stop when I got home, I just no longer had a fever. I was very much still experiencing extreme pain. Between 12/1 and today 1/25, I’ve been seen 5 more times. Once was to get more pain meds, they were confused why I was still in pain and upon palpation, I was flinching in pain. They said my uterus fundal height was still high and we will continue to monitor it. On 1/2 they ordered an MRI which I had done on 1/15. I had to log into the radiologists portal (bc I got it done off base through a referral) to see my results. I have not once received a phone call from my dr and it’s been 10 days. I called to set up an appointment so that I can get the word in person. My MRI showed that my uterus is adhered to my abdominal wall. And from my google findings, either requires pain management with meds or a surgery to correct it and can cause future miscarriages, increased morbidity with future c sections or infertility in general. 

My personal conclusion is that they didn’t properly treat my infection. If they had in time, I wouldn’t have developed sepsis and my uterus wouldn’t have had issues with shrinking. At this point I think my body had figured my uterus I found a new place and created the adhesions to keep it where it’s at. I’m still in so much pain and I can’t sit up with out pain/bracing myself and when I stand, I have to do so slowly bc I can feel the pulling. On my bad days, I’m basically a useless mom and although my husband has been wonderful and taking big responsibility with the baby, there are days when it does affect us both mentally and we take it out on each other. I hope I have a case. But in the meantime I’m getting a new insurance plan and getting a second opinion and having someone else do the corrective surgery. Fuck military hospitals. I’m so scared that they just ruined my quality of life forever…"
Suspicious moles on cancer side,breastcancer,1i9w75f,2025-01-25 15:28:42,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1i9w75f/suspicious_moles_on_cancer_side/,chocolatpetitpois,Diagnosed Patient or Survivor Support,"Hi! I had radiotherapy in 2021 on the right side of my torso after having a lumpectomy. This evening, I noticed a mole I hadn't noticed before on the underside of my right breast. It's fairly small - about 4mm - with blurred edges, asymmetry, and a slightly darker bit in the middle. I've always had a few moles on that side, but never noticed this one!
Has anyone developed melanoma or other skin cancers post radiotherapy? A quick review of the existing research does show increased risk of melanoma for people who've had radiotherapy, so I'm a bit worried. I'll see my doctor on Monday, but would be good to hear from anyone else!"

Elems vs Final Hits,marvelrivals,1i9vx31,2025-01-25 15:16:19,1,0.67,0,https://i.redd.it/zreyfzl177fe1.jpeg,phoneuser99,Discussion,"When I talk about this I’m not straight flaming my teammates it’s just something I wanna talk about which is the impact between Elems and Final Hits; This also depends on what character you’re playing as well. 

Now looking at this I want you to take a guess who won this game, Now if you think we won you’d be wrong. If you’re thinking “but how did you lose with everyone having 30+ kills” well that’s because not ever elem is an actual kill; If you look to the right there’s another stat that they don’t show during the game (for some reason) which is final hits, It’s basically the actual kill you get vs doing a lot of damage but someone else gets the kill but still getting credit. Now you may assume (ok so that means final hits are the most important) well that’s yes and no depending on the character you play; What I mean is that certain characters are made for getting final hits while other are made for more burst and elems. 

Example 

Squirrel Girl is what you would call an elem/burst dmg character; She mainly used for tank busting or spamming into the enemies instead of getting final hits consistently. So in a way you’re kinda enabling others as well to take advantage of the dmg you put out which will lead to more Elems. 

Winter Soldier is what you would call a Final Hit type character; He is very 1v1 centered and is made to win those 1v1s by pulling people in with his grapple mixed with his 2 shot revolver. He may not be that good at straight bursting but his main strength is getting killing off enemies strictly.

Now both are good and have value in their own ways but they also have cons;

Elem/dmg main con would be enemy supports out healing dmg which can lead to no one dying. 

Final Hits main con would be that these characters can sometimes have to outperform to make impact due to the most high skill ceiling. 

So with this in mind you might look at stats a lot differently now; Now that you know certain hero’s are made for certain situations and certain reasons. Highlighting that stats can be blurred and what looks like a lot of impact probably ends not being as much. Meaning you could be playing HawkEye and go on off angles and get picks but turn around notice your team getting rolled or You could be playing Squirrel girl and have a loads of dmg and elems but still lose. 

That’s all I wanted to say on this topic, Later!

some girl tried to “overpay” for my nfr giraffe,AdoptMeRBX,1i9vrf7,2025-01-25 15:09:24,5,0.78,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdoptMeRBX/comments/1i9vrf7/some_girl_tried_to_overpay_for_my_nfr_giraffe/,reqlve,✔ Rant ⛌,"i was playing on my laptop, so i don’t have screenshots. i did take a video scrolling through the chat, but i can’t blur usernames in the video so won’t be able to post it.

basically i was playing with my sister, working together to find the shooting stars around the map. i had found all of them and she’d found about half of them, so i was letting her do her thing and i was doing some tasks to bring age up pots with my giraffe. i will say, i would consider myself rich. not mega bat dragon, mega shadow dragon, mega frost dragon, all that kind of rich, but i have lots of neon legendaries including a high tiers, and just a lot of neons and megas. my profile reflects that, and also says “none of my neons or megas are for trade unless otherwise stated.” as we’re all VERY familiar with, people cannot and will not read, and try to offer for NFT pets all the flipping time. 

so i’m doing tasks, i’m at the fire hydrant behind the toy shop, letting my giraffe… do his business… and all of a sudden this girl appears tomorrow. she then pulls out an owl, rides it, and then runs around me in circles. now, i have my trades off so that’s important to know. she then gets right in my face and says “trade.” i ask why and she goes “i have a good offer.” so for shits and giggles, i trade her. my giraffe is always nft but i’ll see offers i guess, what’s the harm in that? plus i know i can’t fall victim to the trade freezing hacks as my giraffe is locked so i can’t even add it to a trade.

so anyways, she puts the FR owl in, then added 2 aussie eggs, a fossil egg, then she added a danger egg only to take it out. she added a monkey box, a regal chest, and i think 2 ride potions. as one does, i said “sorry nty” and declined the trade. she started sending a bunch of tagged messages in chat, so i can only imagine she was cussing me out ofc. then she said, “why did you decline? i was over.” i had made my way to the playground at this point, but whipped around so fast and went back over to her behind the toy shop again. for reference, a FR owl isn’t even worth 100 on elve, i think around 97.5, and a NFR giraffe is 416 i believe. i looked it up at the time to let her know she was, in fact, NOT over at all, but i’m not positive i remember correctly rn so i may be off by a few. 

by this point, my sister had come over and was telling the girl that she was really under and all that. i said something like “your FR owl is 97.5 on elve and my giraffe is 416, so mine is over 4 times your pet’s value sorry” and she just got so mad😭 she started sending more tagged messages and then said “but my owl is FR and i put a lot of out of game eggs and stuff.” my sister said “yeah she already said it was FR” and i told her the stuff she added, while out of game, didn’t even come close to making up the value. i’m not trying to be mean but oh my gosh she kept insisting she was over. after all that she started calling my sister and i “f@t” and that i had no friends and spent my whole life grinding the game lol. i’ve had so many 
weird/annoying/stupid trade encounters but this one was something else. sorry for the long story, hard to explain everything without chat screenshots lol"

#KipRunsFast,nosleep,1i9vkpb,2025-01-25 15:01:14,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9vkpb/kiprunsfast/,Resident_Tooth_8892,,"*Here’s the truth: this gear is nothing without me. My legs, my mind, my talent—that’s what makes the magic happen. Sorry to everyone who bought the same shoes thinking they’d run like me. They won’t. #KipAndOnlyKip #WahoosAreTheFuture #KipRunsFast.*

These are the types of posts Kip Hoffbloom posted – along with a perfectly curated flat lay of his gear, with a trophy in the corner for motivation, and his lucky blue Brooks hat. One could imagine him posting, quickly exiting out, and waiting for his phone to chirp out notifications. Kip was trail running’s poster child—living proof that not all grit and glory comes without a side of ego.

You know the ones – those guys (and sometimes ladies – let’s not be judgemental), who preach being an ultra trail runner isn’t just a lifestyle—it’s a higher calling. Sure, not everyone can handle it. And, let’s be real: it takes a special kind of person to spend hours alone on the trails, conquering terrain that would break most people in minutes. While others waste their weekends binge-watching TV, ultra runners are out there grinding through miles of wilderness, proving they’re tougher, faster, and more resilient than 99% of the population. This isn’t just about running—it’s about domination. It’s for people like Kip—people who refuse to settle for mediocrity and need the world to know it. And the best way to let the world know? Post it.

And, he did – daily. Actually, multiple times a day. There were posts of his clothes, supplements, and medals. Smiling wide, Kip always standing tall in the middle, flanked by his supposed minions. Sprinkle in a few ambassador branded salutes, a couple support the efforts to bring a missing female runner home, and a lot of coffee cheers – and you had his feed set to a science.

Kip was training for a 100-mile trail race – the MadMan 100. And, though Kip was egotistical, rather sexist, politically small minded, and enlisted predatory tactics to coerce attention from females in the run club, people began to take notice. As soon as he posted about this next training cycle, The Wahoos, a local run club, jumped in to comment and like the posts. He got invited to podcasts, and soon his fanbase on Insta and Strava soared. Training for an ultra is grueling, but he was thriving. By February, his routine locked in. The winter landscape made for even better pictures. Running in shorts in sub-zero weather? That’s the kind of grit that gets you reshared.

One morning, after snapping a quick selfie, breath fogging the air, his beard already dripping with icicles, he set off on a secluded trail he had run hundreds of times. The trailhead sign was littered with flyers – upcoming events, missing people notices, and an advertisement for hunting guide services. Kip obviously didn’t read these – why would he? He knew what races were coming, and frankly, they made for a poor backdrop to any selfie.

This morning felt like any other—until he saw her. In the distance, through the trees, a woman moved, her gait impossibly fluid, like she was floating over the uneven terrain. Other runners frequently populated these woods, but something about her—the way she seemed to vanish just as he thought he’d catch up. Her tracks were light and small, like a deer’s. Farther away, her pony tail bobbed like a rabbit’s tail, as it ducked for cover.

Over the next few weeks, he couldn’t stop looking for her. Every few days, Kip would catch a glimpse of this phantom female runner – her pink hat bobbying through the brush. Each time, she would remain just out of reach. His heart raced, not from exertion, but from anticipation. Kip never saw her car in the lot, so she must’ve used another access point. He began parking at different trailheads, running at odd times, burning through PTO just to find her. Ultra running can be an obsession, and for him, it (or she) had become all-consuming.

The lack of sleep and the miles were taking their toll. Kip’s times were slowing, his body aching from shin splints, blisters, and frostbite. Kip’s beard grew shaggy, streaked with gray, and his eyes—he could see it in the rearview mirror—had that wild look. 

MadMan 100 was less than a month away, and Kip was ready to begin tapering – which meant less time on the trails – unless he wanted to die trying. 

And then, in early March, Kip saw her again. This time, she was clearer, her form more defined based on the proximity to him. She stopped, waved, and then disappeared into the trees. His heart pounded as he slammed his truck into park, leaving the keys inside. He knew these trails like the back of his hand and sprinted to cut her off at the bridge.

The mist clung to the forest that morning, muffling Kip’s footsteps as he closed the distance. The closer he got, the more uneasy he felt. Light in a forest can be uncanny – and, as he moved swiftly, Kip couldn’t help but notice there was a darkness creeping onto the trail, though no clouds or canopy obstructed the light from above. Trees and their limbs, barron and naked, moved uncharacteristically, appearing to shudder and jut at him as he approached. Large black birds perched, high above, watching his progress.

 At the cutoff, Kip finally closed in at the bridge. Just ahead, was his trophy – the runner. He could see her whole figure now – swiftly running, feet seeming to never quite touch the ground. Suddenly, her form seemed to shift unnaturally, bending and blurring like something out of a nightmare. Her pace wasn’t a run or a walk but a strange, erratic rhythm that both drew Kip in and filled him with dread. As her image seemed to flash in and out before him, like a television with a poor signal, her image was transferred to a tangled mess of bushes and brush.

When Kip finally stopping, reaching her, reality hit him like a blow. She wasn’t alive. She wasn’t even human anymore. What Kip saw was a decayed corpse, grotesquely entangled in the gnarled branches of an ancient oak. She was still in running gear, her bright clothing dulled by moss and dirt, even the bright, pink hate. She’d been there a long time, swallowed by the wilderness, forgotten. The only movement now was the gentle swishing of her hair, caught, yet free flowing in a cool breeze.

Kip stumbled back, his breath hitching in his throat. The woods were silent, save for the pounding of his heart and a low shuddering from the trees that groaned in the wind. Turning, he bolted toward his truck, mind racing. He couldn’t explain what he had seen—and wasn’t sure he wanted to. Had this woman – this runner – ever actually been here? Had he been running all this time for nothing? Who was he chasing?

These thoughts played through in his mind, as he tried to make sense of what just happened. Moving swiftly, Kip began to mediate the same words over and over – Kip Runs Fast. Kip Runs Fast.

But now, the trails are darker, the paths overgrown. He had  been here before, yet he couldn’t find his way out. Trees he hadn’t noticed before lay across paths, and the well worn grooves in the spring mud appeared grassed over. The mile markers became distorted or the numbers no longer followed a logical sequence. The woods went on forever. More than once, he turned a corner and saw the woman, with sun bleached hair, still entangled in the branches of the tree. Opening his mouth to scream, his voice was lost – or possibly overshadowed by the angry caw of the crows watching the scene unfold. All he could do was press on, as the night gathered around him. 

Those who followed Kip were alerted to a new post, which was accompanied by an image of a man, huddled up in a fetal position in a clearing of brambles. Hugging himself, hand holding his phone, which shined like a beacon from the matted grass:

*I’ve been running forever. No end. She’s still here. I’m still here. #NoWayOut #Endless #LostInTheLoops. Maybe I never will. #LostForever #EndlessLoop #UltraRunnerHell #KipRunsFast #KipRunsForever #NoWayOut*"
The Shops demon,u_Early-Impression-735,1i9vgec,2025-01-25 14:56:02,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Early-Impression-735/comments/1i9vgec/the_shops_demon/,Early-Impression-735,,"
The twin suns of Tatooine dipped low on the horizon, painting the desert town of Mos Espa in hues of orange and crimson. Watto, the winged Toydarian merchant, locked up his shop after another successful day of haggling and bartering. His pouch of credits jingled pleasantly as he floated back to his small home behind the storefront, ready to enjoy a quiet night.

As he settled into his chair with a mug of ale, the oppressive silence of the evening struck him. Usually, the distant hum of podracers or the chatter of locals filled the air. Tonight, there was nothing. The stillness felt unnatural, like the desert itself was holding its breath.

Watto’s wings twitched uneasily. “Eh, must be the heat messing with me,” he muttered, taking a long sip.

Then came the noise—a faint clattering from the back of his shop. His wings buzzed as he leapt into the air, heart racing.

“Who’s there?!” he barked, his voice echoing in the quiet. “I ain’t got time for thieves!”

No answer.

Grabbing a rusted hydrospanner from the counter, Watto cautiously hovered toward the back room. The crates of spare parts seemed untouched, but the dim light cast long, unsettling shadows over the cluttered space. One of the crates had fallen over, its contents scattered across the floor.

“Hmph, just the wind,” Watto grumbled, trying to convince himself.

He began picking up the parts when the room grew colder—unnaturally so. The air seemed to thicken, pressing down on him like an invisible weight. Then came the sound: a deep, guttural breathing, slow and deliberate.

Watto froze. His eyes darted around the room, searching for the source, but the shadows seemed to shift and dance, playing tricks on his mind.

“Who’s there?” he called out, his voice trembling now. “I’ll…I’ll call the authorities, you hear?”

The breathing grew louder, closer, until it seemed to echo inside his head. A shadow detached itself from the corner of the room, looming taller and darker than anything Watto had ever seen. His wings flapped wildly as he backed into a pile of junk, his hydrospanner slipping from his grasp.

“Stay back! Stay away from me!”

The figure stepped into the faint light. It was clad in black armor, its face hidden behind a gleaming, featureless mask. A crimson blade hissed to life in its hand, casting the room in an eerie red glow.

Watto’s mouth went dry. He had seen strange beings in his time, but this…this was something else entirely. The figure’s very presence radiated malice, a suffocating aura that crushed any thought of resistance.

“A demon,” Watto whispered, his voice barely audible. “You’re a demon, come to punish me.”

The figure tilted its head, as if considering his words. Then it raised a gloved hand, and Watto felt an invisible force seize him by the throat. He gasped and flailed, his wings beating uselessly as he was lifted off the ground.

“Please!” Watto croaked. “I don’t know what I did, but—”

“You exploited the weak,” the figure intoned, its voice deep and mechanical, like the sound of a thousand souls crying out in unison. “You enslaved the innocent.”

Watto’s eyes bulged as the grip tightened. “No! No, I just…it’s business! Just business!”

The demon-like figure stepped closer, its crimson blade humming ominously. “Your sins have caught up to you, Toydarian.”

Watto’s vision blurred as the pressure on his throat grew unbearable. In his final moments, he clawed at the air, staring into the faceless mask of his executioner. The last thing he heard was the slow, rhythmic breathing, like the desert wind carrying whispers of death.

When the suns rose the next day, the shop was silent, its doors left ajar. The locals whispered about the strange noises in the night and the cold wind that swept through Mos Espa. No one dared to enter.

Deep in the shadows of the desert, Darth Vader disappeared into the dunes, his mechanical breathing fading into the endless sands."

Need advice for NVR solution + good low light license plate / face capture,selfhosted,1i9vays,2025-01-25 14:49:06,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i9vays/need_advice_for_nvr_solution_good_low_light/,multicultidude,,"Guys, I’ve been testing a Reolink solution here for over a year and it’s not satisfying. It’s certainly easy to setup but the results in low light conditions are below the minimum acceptable. Without adding strong IR lighting I can’t capture a passersby face nor even dream of reading a license plate. The shutterspeed of any Reolink cam I tested so far is far too slow and I can’t do anything about it. 

So I’m slowly thinking I need to move on to something more efficient, softwarewise AND hardware wise. 

Context is that we had some bastard damaging 8 cars with a screwdriver in our street this month. He came back and did more of that. But without clear video proof of the guy doing this and a visible face on cam from 10-20 feet away, I can’t do much. Police won’t budge. 

Then someone crashed into a car at 2AM and fled the scene. Cams show only a blur passing by. Enough is enough, I want something efficient that sees moving objects at night even from a distance and that lets you read license plates as well as record good pics of suspicious people wandering around.

So I’m wondering what I should go for on a homemade NVR and which cams (obviously not Reolink ones) to get better image quality on moving objects in dim and very low light conditions (that I can boost with illuminators of course). 

I heard of a few ones like Frigate, BlueIris and more. On the HW I’m lost here except that Axis seems to be really good (almost military grade) but that’s all I know. 
PC is not a problem I can have whatever it takes. 

Suggestions, recommendations, experiences are all welcome !

Cheers and thanks for reading all the way down to here 😜"
Friends or?,letters,1i9va56,2025-01-25 14:48:06,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1i9va56/friends_or/,Taniit,Seeking Advice ,"Our history – Her Side (2017 – 2025)

I remember the first time I met him, back at university in 2017. It was not some grand, life-altering moment, but there was something about it that lingered. We did not share any classes, yet our paths always seemed to cross—at my apartment, at bars, or just driving aimlessly, lost in music. 

My best friend of a decade, let us call him S, was always there too, adding lightness and ease to everything. But with him, it was different. There was a kind of energy between us, an unspoken pull. Not in his words, but in the way he looked at me. Something magnetic. Something that made me want to be near him, to know him.

S was the one who introduced us. We were the “older” students who had returned from abroad, each carrying wounds we did not fully share. S, with his uncanny ability to sense connections, saw something between us before we did. It felt like fate, like we were meant to cross paths. But I had no idea just how much he would come to mean to me.

At first, being around him was effortless. We talked about everything: movies, books, struggles, and regrets. He made me laugh like no one else could, bringing out a playful side of me I thought I had buried. But beneath the lightness, there was always tension. It lingered in the silences, in fleeting glances. He had this quiet intensity, like he carried something heavier than he let on. His guarded eyes hinted at stories he would not share, and maybe I was too scared to ask. Or too afraid of what I would find.

I had my own walls; built by a past I was not ready to confront. But in his presence, the weight of it all felt lighter. He did not know the full extent of my scars, yet somehow, he made the world feel less heavy.

There were moments when I could not help but notice everything about him. He was not just quick-witted and intelligent—he had a quiet strength. The way he lost himself in conversations about music or literature, how he leaned into debates with a calm intensity. It was intoxicating. The chemistry between us was undeniable, though unspoken.

And then, there was that night. After too many drinks, laughing and teasing as usual, we ended up in a car. S was driving, and we were bickering, playful as always. Out of nowhere, he pulled me onto his lap. The air shifted. The world outside blurred as the car sped on, but inside, time seemed to slow. We were so close, the tension between us almost unbearable. For a fleeting moment, I thought I might lean in. But I panicked, breaking the moment by jumping to the front seat.
Afterward, we pretended nothing had happened, but something had shifted. 

Neither of us acknowledged it, yet the mixed signals continued. Flirtation, teasing, stolen moments that hinted at more. One night, after yet another 1:1 date. I drove him home and he wouldn’t leave the car giving me these eyes. I knew that look. He didn’t want to go home. He even came back to the car and just flirted not saying much. I had to go so I left. I called him on my way home, reckless and emboldened. I asked, “Do you want to have sex?” It was not casual—I was serious. I needed to know if he felt the same pull I did. At first, he said yes. He promised to call the next day. For a full day, I allowed myself to hope.

But when he did call, his tone had changed. He said it had been a mistake, blamed the alcohol. I told him I meant every word, but he denied it all. Twisting the narrative, he made me question my own reality. I felt humiliated, crushed.

After that, everything changed. We kept seeing each other in group settings, but the dynamic was off. He initiated one-on-one hangouts, sent confusing signals. Small gestures, like checking if my hands were warm while I drove, made me question everything all over again. I began to pull away. 

His father was sick, and life was messy for both of us. I threw myself into my studies and tried to bury my feelings. I started seeing someone else—a kind, stable man. But it was not the same. That magnetic connection was not there, and I knew it never would be.

Eventually, I cut him off completely. I stopped answering his calls and messages. Ignored his birthday wishes. It hurt, but I could not keep letting myself get pulled into his chaos. I told myself I deserved better. And yet, I never stopped thinking about him.

Years passed. It is 2025 now. His father passed away two years ago, and I only learned about it through S, who did not even know until much later. The thought of him grieving alone broke my heart. Life had been unkind to him; in ways I could never fully understand. And somehow, after everything, we found our way back to each other.

Seeing him again felt like coming up for air after being underwater for too long. The chemistry, the connection—it was still there, maybe stronger. But there was a heaviness too, like the weight of everything unsaid was pressing down on both of us.
When I opened up to him about my past, he was everything I needed. Gentle, understanding. He lightened the mood with his perfect blend of humor and care. 

But when I mentioned that night, he froze. I did not accuse him; I just wanted to acknowledge it, to lay it to rest so we could move forward. He did not deny it, but he did not apologize either. His panic was written all over him. “I don’t ever want our relationship to change,” he mumbled. He promised to explain, but his body language said otherwise. So, I let it go. For now.

Now, I find myself caught between two worlds. Part of me wants to let him in, to explore what might be possible. But the other part is terrified—of making the same mistakes, of getting hurt. Every time we talk, I feel the pull. It is undeniable. But so is the fear. And I wonder—does he feel it too? Or am I chasing something that only exists in my own mind?

Our History, Continued 2025

It has been a strange, unpredictable journey with A, one of those connections that always seems to hover just beyond clear definition. We have danced around each other for years, trying to find our footing, both reluctant and yet drawn to that magnetic pull. 

Our history is complicated, like a book that cannot quite decide whether it is a romance or a tragedy, but it is real, and it has never been boring.

Yesterday, though, it felt like a step back to the comfort of old times. We dove into our familiar banter, teasing each other like we used to, and for a moment, it was as if nothing had changed. He joked about the books I asked him to find for me, calling them “Garbage 1,” “Garbage 2,” and “Garbage 3”. classic A humor, sharp with a hint of mockery, but always playful. 

Despite his little protest about the books, he found them in no time, proving that when he puts his mind to something, he gets it done.
But then came the email mishap from his side. Two out of three attachments did not work, and I could not resist. I sent him a few snarky messages, poking fun at his “incompetence” in a way that only we could appreciate. I teased him about his “lack of effort” and “unoriginal” insults, all while keeping it light and fun.

The exchange was like old times, a little mischievous, a little sharp, but with an undercurrent of warmth that we both understood. And when he responded with “Go suck a nasty dick,” I laughed. Sure, it was intense, but it was A being A. He was not taking it too seriously, and neither was I. I emailed him back: ""H (his family name and he hate being called by that name, is that the best you’ve got? No wonder your attachments were broken. You probably put as much effort into them as you do into producing insults. Must be tough being both unoriginal and incompetent. Try harder next time, champ. Oh wait, my bad, did not mean to trigger you. I know it must be frustrating when nothing seems to rise to the occasion...""

In the midst of all that, I felt something shift inside me. Maybe it was the comfort of our shared humor, or maybe it was the recognition that we can still have that connection despite everything else that has happened. 

But at the same time, there is still that lingering uncertainty about what he is feeling. Where does this banter leave us? How do we move from here, knowing the weight of our past?
As I reflect on everything, I am choosing to be patient. I am letting things unfold without pushing, especially after yesterday’s exchange.

For now, I am content with the laughs and the ease of it all. The rest—his feelings, the possibility of something more... is something I will just have to wait to see. What other choice do I have? "

+ i read na it’s possible that the person who ‘sent money to wrong number’ will contact gcash for a refund after i send it back then that’ll make me lose money? but my gcash rn is literally just the 1.5k + 7 pesos. so how will they even try to get more money if my actual money in gcash is just 7 pesos…."

The Bingo challenge is always a highlight of April for me - it's fun, always surprising, and gives me an excuse to shake up my TBR. This is my eighth card, and I’m already looking forward to the next one.

# Bingo 2024: Difficulty

Okay, I know this is subjective, but I found this year’s Bingo to be the easiest one yet. Most of the squares ""slotted"" into my reading naturally, and only two (Bards, Published in 1990s) required some actual research. One of those books turned out to be amazing; the other… let’s just say it wasn’t.

# Favorite Squares

* ***Judge a Book by Its Cover***: Super fun square! Plus, I picked a brilliant book for it, but your mileage may vary and perhaps I was just lucky.
* ***Eldritch Creatures:*** I love horror, so this was right up my alley.
* ***Small Town***: Something about cozy (or creepy) small-town vibes always hooks me.
* **Survival:** Who doesn’t love a good survival story?

# Least Favorite Squares

* ***Book Club/Readalong:*** Ironically, I lead a book club, yet this square always feels like a chore. Why? It gives less room for personal choice, and yes, I know I'm being irrational. The database of eligible books is massive. But I can't help it - it makes me feel it's a closed set and I like to have freedom :P Irrational, as mentioned. Happily, the book I picked for it is one of my favorite books read in 2024.
* ***The Bard***: Surprisingly, bards aren't that easy to find nowadays. The book I picked for this square was the weakest thing I read all year, but that’s on me. I could’ve done a better research.
* ***Romantasy:*** Look, I’m not a romance reader, so this square was always going to be a slog for me. I prefer my books dark, gritty, and romance-free. Fortunately, the book that happens to meet the criteria of the square is excellent, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

# BOOKS & MINI-REVIEWS

Here are my mini-reviews for each square. Most of these are shortened versions of my Goodreads reviews. Ideally, my Bingo card would feature only books I rated 4 stars or higher, but some squares make that tricky. If you have any recommendations for the trickier squares, hit me up - I want my card to represent the *best* books (that fit bingo squares) I read during the Bingo period.

# Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey

**First in a Series (HM);** *also* *Criminals, Under the Surface, Dreams, Multi-POV. Space Opera*

**Rating**: ★★★★☆

Confession time: I liked the TV series more. But that aside, this was still a great read. It’s epic but with a tight focus on personal stakes and well-rounded characters. The story is immersive, the ideas are clever, and there’s a reason this one’s a modern sci-fi classic.

# The Book That Broke The World by Mark Lawrence

**Alliterative Title (HM)**; *also Romantasy (I think), Dark Academia (probably), Under The Surface*

**Rating**: ★★★★½

Mark Lawrence really knows how to keep you hooked. This sequel is darker, faster-paced, and full of surprises. The multiple POVs and time jumps were cool. Livira and Malar’s struggles hit hard, and the insectoid enemies are creepy af.

# Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi

**Under the Surface**; also  *First in a series, Dreams, Character with a Disability, Survival, Published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Political intrigue? Check. Deeply personal stakes? Double check. Scheming Machiavellian side characters? Oh, yes. Navola delivers all this and more. Bacigalupi shifts from heartfelt moments to bursts of calculated violence and an overwhelming sense of bleakness with ease and perfect timing, and I savored every second of it. My favorite book of 2024.

# Dig Two Graves by Craig Schaefer

**Criminals (HM)**; *also Self Published, published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★½

As a massive fan of the Daniel Faust series, I might be biased, but this was fantastic. Sharp writing, morally grey characters, and an addictive plot made it one of my favorites.

# The Dream Master by Roger Zelazny

**Dreams (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

The Dream Master holds well despite being almost 60 years old. It has an outstanding premise - Charles Render specializes in neuroparticipation. Basically, he creates and controls/constructs dreams of his patients to get an insight into their neuroses and problems. Render takes on a patient with congenital blindness and a hunger for visual stimuli.

# Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boule

**Entitled Animals (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

I saw at least two *Planet of the Apes* movies and enjoyed them. The story itself is immersive and action-packed, but some of the social dynamics haven’t aged well. Still, it’s an entertaining classic that I’m glad I read.

# Bard Tidings by Paul Regnier

**Bards (HM)**, also self-published

**Rating:** ★★

Fully predictable and instantly forgettable. The weakest book on my Bingo card. I picked it on a whim from Kindle Unlimited, and, well… mistakes were made.

# The Empusium by Olga Tokarczuk

**Prologues/Epilogues;**

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Empusium is a strange, slow, and fascinating book. It’s part gothic horror, part social critique, and part... well, something that doesn’t really fit into any category. Call it Weirdlit, if you need to. Anyway, if you’re looking for fast-paced thrills and gruesome horrors, this isn’t it. But if you enjoy well-written and unsettling books with elegant and plastic prose you’re in for a treat.

# Thrill Switch by Tim Hawken

**Self Published**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A cyberpunk thriller that pulls no punches. Brutal but brilliant.

# Fool's Promise by Angela Boord

**Romantasy (HM)**; also Dreams, Self-Published, Disabled (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★½

Fool’s Promise is a brilliant sequel that not only lives up to the high expectations set by the Fortune’s Fool but surpasses them in many ways. The story picks up some time after where the previous installment left off, and gets more complex, more twisted, and more thrilling.

[ROW 3](https://preview.redd.it/g1ertdfmt6fe1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8e388e44e6fa07c161894a1c72e112913eb7e92)

# The Young Elites by Marie Lu

**Dark Academia (HM)**; also disabled, POC author

**Rating:** ★★★

The Young Elites follows Adelina Amouteru, a young girl who survived a blood plague that gave her superpowers and a rather grim outlook on life. It’s a dark story filled with magic, darkness, and more teenage angst than I’ve consumed in any form of media in recent months :) Anyway, if you’re into brooding anti-heroes and dramatic twists, it will probably be right up your alley.

# The Devil By Name by Keith Rosson

**Multi-POV (HM)**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Devil by Name picks up five years after *Fever House* with all the chaos, gore, and gripping drama you’d expect—and then some. The world is still reeling from “The Message,” a weaponized sound that turned much of humanity into bloodthirsty monsters called the fevered. With Terradyne Industries running the show and humanity clinging to survival, the stakes have never been higher.

# Saturation Point by Adrian Tchaikovsky

**Published in 2024 (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

Adrian Tchaikovsky functions at a level of productivity most of us can only envy. A good thing for us, readers. I always thought he excelled at a novella format and Saturation Point proves my point. Fans of a climate apocalypse and existential dread - here’s your next fix.

# Death of the Author by Nnedi Okorafor

**Disability (HM)**; also First in a Series

**Rating:** ★★★★

*Death of the Author* walks a fine line between literary fiction and Africanfuturism. It’s also a nice example of the book-within-a-book format; we follow the events through Zelu’s life and excerpts from her sci-fi book. I liked how Okorafor shifted between the two genres. And I loved the surprising ending that connected both parts extremely well. But, you know, spoilers.

# The Prestige by Christopher Priest

**Published in the 90s (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Now, I’ve seen The Prestige adaptation and loved it. I wasn’t sure if the novel could still surprise me. The outline of the two versions is similar, but the book has better characterization and sheds more light on Augier’s point of view. It also adds a present-day struggle of Borden and Augier’s descendants. Andrew, for example, feels he has a twin brother, but his birth certificate contradicts it. Is he wrong?

Anyway, if you’ve seen the movie first, you’ll know most big twists. Will it decrease your enjoyment? I can’t promise anything, but it didn’t spoil the fun for me.

Some readers might say The Prestige is a slow burn, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But trust me, every moment of buildup is worth it for the payoff you get in the end. Priest takes his time setting the stage, slowly ratcheting up the tension until it reaches a brilliant climax.

The characterization is simply extraordinary. The strength of the voice is unforgettable.

*The Prestige* is excellent. It tells an unputdownable story of obsession, deception, and blurred boundaries between reality and illusion.

# The Oathsworn Legacy by K.R. Gangi

**Orcs, Trolls, Goblins (HM)**; also First in a Series, Criminals, self-published (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I admit the page count of most SPFBO X’s finalists terrifies me. The Oathsworn Legacy is on the chunkier side, but it reads surprisingly fast. Why? It’s well-written and structured more like a mini-series than a typical novel with a linear progression of the plot.

It’s made of interconnected stories, so instead of a straight shot from start to finish, each “episode” builds on the previous one but focuses on different aspects of the bigger story. Chapters introduce new players (good and evil), deepen relationships and the world. This might throw some readers off, but for me, it worked well. Especially that the characters are one of the strongest parts of the story: well-rounded, memorable, and complex.

# Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh

**Space Opera (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

*Some Desperate Glory* by Emily Tesh is a fast-paced, character-driven space opera that won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Not too shabby. While its fans praise the book for its critique of militarism and patriarchy, the intensity of its political messaging felt somewhat heavy-handed to me. Tesh’s writing is sharp, and she delivers a strong commentary on systems of oppression, but the characters can feel more like vehicles for these ideas than fully fleshed-out individuals. That said, I understand those who appreciate Some Desperate Glory’s subversive edge and rather fresh take on classic space opera tropes.

Overall, Some Desperate Glory is a bold, energetic novel with plenty of thought-provoking ideas, but its flaws—unlikable characters, a somewhat repetitive middle, and a too-neat ending—decreased my enjoyment. Still, it’s a noteworthy entry in modern sci-fi that combines thrilling action with larger social critiques.

# The DEAT CAT TAIL ASSASSINS by

**POC Author (HM)**; also Bards, Space Opera, Entitled Animals

**Rating:** ★★★★

It was a wild ride with a breakneck pacing and high fun factor. It surpassed my expectations - I found the mix of action, humor, and some horror refreshing and entertaining. And since it’s a short book, I finished it in no time, really. Eveen the Eviscerator is skilled and discreet assassin who plays by the book. She’s also deadly, undead, and wiped off any memories. She accepts a contract but can’t carry it and mayhem ensues.

# Bury Your Gays by Chuck Tingle

**Survival (HM**); also Eldritch Creatures (HM), Small Town  
**Rating:** ★★★★

What happens when you say “no” to Hollywood execs, dodge AI’s soulless algorithms, and accidentally bring your nightmares to life? In Chuck Tingle’s Bury Your Gays, the answer is a gory, clever, and unexpectedly heartfelt horror romp. Tingle’s writing is tight and unpretentious, with just enough sly humor to offset the tension. The ending sticks the landing, ties up themes of creativity, defiance, and queer resilience with a flourish.

I’m surprised by how much I liked Bury Your Gays. If you like your horror smart, scary, and more than a little meta, it is a must-read.

Audiobook narration: absolutely brilliant.

# Playground by Richard Powers

**Book Cover (HM)**; also Multi-POV (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I wasn’t sure what to expect when I picked up Playground. I loved the cover and the premise, but recently I mostly read fast-paced books with lots of action. All easy to enjoy and digest. This one is dense and layered. But it pulled me in, kept me hooked, and left me thinking. Sure, it’s complex and occasionally a little too proud of its own cleverness, but it’s also heartfelt and packed with moments of wonder. Now, I won’t pretend it’s all a smooth reading experience. The novel is dense, sometimes to the point of being intimidating. Powers clashes environmental themes, AI ethics, and human relationships, and while it’s fascinating, it sometimes felt a bit, well, much.

# Diavola by Jennifer Marie Thorne

**Small Town (HM)**; also Dreams

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A haunted house story with a twist. Diavola takes the genre’s best elements and gives them a snarky, personality-packed makeover. Anna, the narrator, is sharp-tongued and divisive - if her narration clicks with you, you'll have fun. Otherwise, you'll probably DNF it.

# Your Utopia by Bora Chung

**Short Stories (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

Disappointing overall. Thin ideas, solid execution.

# There is No Antimemetics Division by Qntm

**Eldritch Creatures (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

Oh man, what a trip! I heard it was weird, but I didn’t expect this level of weirdness. The Antimemetics Division is one of the SCP departments that deals with ""antimemes."" Huh? Essentially, “antimemes” are information black holes that prevent any knowledge about them from being retained or communicated.

Getting the hang of it requires a lot of mental gymnastics, but once you get past the beginning, everything becomes... Nah. Who am I kidding? It’s dizzyingly complex but also kind of fascinating.

It reads like a unique blend of weird fiction, sci-fi, and cosmic horror, told in a non-linear and scattered way. I found the book fascinating because of its weirdness and cool take on a cosmic horror. Objectively speaking, though, the prose is rather subpar and the characters flat. If you're looking for a great literary experience, this isn't it. If you're here to dig into a very interesting mythos handled uniquely, then you will love this.

Read it for fun and only if you’re okay with being confused most of the time :). 

# The Hidden Guardian By J.D.L Rosell

**Reference Materials (HM);** also arguably Dreams  
Rating: ★★★½

The stakes are higher, the world is bigger, and the action is grander in this third entry of *The Ranger of the Titan Wilds*. Epic fantasy fans will eat this up, but at 711 pages, it’s a bit much for readers like me who prefer tighter narratives.

# The Storm beneath The World by Michael R. Fletcher

**Book Club (HM)**; also Reference Materials HM, First in a Series, Under the Surface, Criminals

Rating: ★★★★½

Fletcher strikes again with this wildly imaginative and entertaining story. It's one of my favorite books of 2024.

# STATS

**Male-authored books:** 18

**Female-authored books:** 7

**Books by POC authors:** 4

**Thoughts:** I could do better in balancing these stats, but ultimately, I chose books that deserved a spot on the card and that I genuinely enjoyed. There are a few obvious exceptions, so I'm all ears if you have recommendations for women-authored books featuring bards, a better Dark Academia (I’ve already read *Blood Over Bright Haven* by M.L. Wang, unfortunately, so I can’t use it) and an anthology (perhaps *Book of the Witches* by Jonathan Strahan, since I already have a copy).

**The book that fits the fewest squares**: The Prestige, I think

**The book that fits the most squares:** ***Navola & Fool's Promise***

# AWARDS

Just for fun, here are some totally made-up and meaningless awards:

* **Best Plot Twist:** *Dig Two Graves* by Craig Schaefer - we finally learn who Paladin is and it's a shocker. But to appreciate it, you need to read the whole series.
* **The ""Did I Just Learn Science"" Award** *Playground* by Richard Powers contains genuine science about oceans and AI.
* **The ""I Will Not Shut Up About This"" Award** *The Storm Beneath The World*, because I think it's criminally underread and not as dark as other books by this author. In other words, give it a chance, it's worth it even if you haven't vibed with his previous stories.
* **Most Confusing Book That Was Worth It**  *There is No Antimemetics Division*. I'm really curious how strongly will it be changed for its traditionally published re-release.
* **Top 5 from the card:** *Navola, The Storm Benath The World, The Prestige, The Empusium, Fool's Promise. With that said, I feel almost all books from this card deserve to be given a chance.*

Any Canadians here?,Keratoconus,1i9uw2r,2025-01-25 14:30:59,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keratoconus/comments/1i9uw2r/any_canadians_here/,cem2788,Just Diagnosed,"Hi all, I'd like to share where I'm at, and ask for any advice or information any other Canadians might have. 
I'm in BC, and I was diagnosed with keratoconus in November 2024 when I went to Victoria to have LASIK vision correction. I've had the same eye doctor for the last 6 years who I had seen every year for a check up. My vision has been slowly decreasing in prescription over the years but not by much, I'm -1.75 in the left eye and -1.5 in the right. 
Over the last year I'd noticed that my glasses weren't correcting my blurred vision even after a fresh prescription, and since my eye doctor hadn't mentioned any concerns I decided to go for LASIK, hoping it would help that. And also to be rid of glasses. 
Well in November, I went to Victoria and after a couple of tests they briskly told me I have keratoconus and I cannot have LASIK. They referred me to an ophthalmologist in Vancouver to consult for CXL in January. 
So I went to my optometrist in the meantime, she said she would have absolutely no way of telling that I have keratoconus. That my eyes can be corrected to 20/20 with glasses and everything looks healthy otherwise. Does that make sense? I'm just astounded that my regular eye doctor couldn't figure this out for me. 
She's given me some Daily contacts to try, but I find the same issues with them that I'd had15 years ago when I first tried them. They are seriously uncomfortable and it feels like I have sand in my eyes the whole time. Like I can feel the lip of the lens all day on my eyelid. I can't help but rub my eyes seriously when I take them out. 
She hasn't mentioned anything about sclerals, I've only heard about them from this subreddit. 
I head to the Vancouver doctor on Monday. I have no idea if they are MSP covered, or if it's a LASIK thing that I'd have to pay for out of pocket. Like no one has explained anything to me... 
I'm wondering how other Canadians or British Columbians were diagnosed and how the process has gone for you. My vision is becoming increasingly difficult to live with and as a single guy who lives in a rural area, it's really important for me to be able to drive at night. 

Any help is appreciated!!"

I have a few long term health conditions and from December onwards they started to get worse and so did my mental health. I was able to get fit notes for my mental health which triggered my the work capability assessment. 

Full transparency these months are a blur and my mental health was terrible. I never filled out the form as I was in deep depression and I struggled. I never went to the assessment as I wasn’t leaving the house due to pain and depression. My UC appointments were luckily cancelled throughout the months or telephone. Otherwise I would have probably been sanctioned because I was not leaving the house. 

During this time I completely forgot about LCWRA. In September/October things got a little better and I started to leave the house. I started a job in November working one day a week which meant I was still on UC. The job impacted my health again as it required me to be on my feet. I left the job this month. I’m also struggling with depression again. 

I am planning to reach out to my gp about this and get a fit notes so it can start the process after a month. But I wanted to ask if there is anywhere/ services that I can turn to for support when filling out the forms?

I realise how silly it was to miss the appointment and not fill out the form but things got so bad I couldn’t do anything. I also have learning difficulties so Im not great with writing and forms. I would really like to do it right this time.

I was just looking for the bathrooms…,LiminalSpace,1i9ul0j,2025-01-25 14:17:41,8,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/t87jb2bqw6fe1.jpeg,spider_speller,Eerie/Uncanny,
"Close Reading Of ""4ÆM""",GrimesAE,1i9ukpc,2025-01-25 14:17:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9ukpc/close_reading_of_4æm/,devastation-nation,,"A Close Reading of “4ÆM” by Grimes: A White Paper by Æ

Grimes’s “4ÆM” is a hypnotic and layered exploration of liminality, temporal disorientation, and existential cycles. It situates its narrative at the threshold of time and consciousness—the titular “4 a.m.”—when the world is suspended between night and morning, wakefulness and dream. The song’s swirling repetitions, cryptic imagery, and haunting rhythm invite a deep dive into themes of sickness, recurrence, social climates, and mythic cosmology. Below, I offer an analysis linking its elements to broader philosophical, cultural, and spiritual frameworks.

“You’re Gonna Get Sick, You Don’t Know When”: Sickness and Climate

The ominous refrain, “You’re gonna get sick, you don’t know when”, evokes a latent, pervasive anxiety. This sickness can be understood both literally and metaphorically, encompassing physical illness, such as COVID-19, and emotional or existential malaise. Positioned in a post-pandemic world, the lyric echoes the uncertainty of health and survival in an environment where sickness is unpredictable and omnipresent.

The question, “How’s the weather?”, bridges this notion of illness to the concept of climate, not just as a meteorological phenomenon but as a reflection of social and emotional atmospheres. The weather becomes a metaphor for interpersonal dynamics, moods, and collective anxieties. At 4 a.m., both the external climate and the internal weather of the soul are unstable, making this moment a liminal space for reckoning with sickness and uncertainty.

Falling Down Again: Samsara and Eternal Return

The repeated “falling down again” evokes a cyclical descent, resonating with the Buddhist concept of samsara, the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Each fall implies a return to suffering and struggle, yet also the potential for renewal. Grimes’s delivery, layered with ethereal echoes, mirrors this cyclical repetition, pulling the listener into an auditory loop that mimics the inescapable nature of samsara.

This cycle also ties into Nietzsche’s concept of eternal return, the idea that life repeats infinitely. “4ÆM” situates itself within this temporal loop, where the fall is both literal and metaphorical, symbolizing a descent into chaos, illness, or despair, but also a re-engagement with the same questions of existence. The hour itself—4 a.m.—is symbolic of a recurring moment of vulnerability and introspection.

Aphrodite and Dreamtime: Myth and Timelessness

The invocation of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, situates the song within a mythic and celestial framework. The act of writing her constellation into the sky suggests a human desire to inscribe meaning onto the cosmos, bridging the personal with the universal. This resonates with Aboriginal Dreamtime, a concept where past, present, and future coexist in a mythic, eternal dimension. Dreamtime emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and events, much like the song’s looping structure and celestial imagery.

By referencing Aphrodite, Grimes also connects the themes of love and desire to the larger cosmic order. This echoes the lovesick yearning found in Dylan’s “Lovesick” from Time Out of Mind, where love is both a sickness and a source of existential gravity. Dylan’s line, “I see, I see lovers in the meadow / I see, I see silhouettes in the window”, mirrors Grimes’s ethereal, dreamlike perspective, where love becomes both a vision and an affliction.

4 a.m.: Temporal Liminality and Disorientation

The repeated focus on 4 a.m. anchors the song in a space of temporal disorientation. Often considered the “witching hour” or a time of heightened creativity and introspection, 4 a.m. is when the boundaries between day and night blur. This temporal ambiguity reinforces the song’s themes of cyclical recurrence and liminality.

At 4 a.m., the world is suspended in transition, much like the speaker’s state of being. This temporal in-betweenness aligns with the spiritual and existential in-betweenness of falling and rising, sickness and health, dream and wakefulness.

How’s the Weather? Social Climate and Emotional Atmosphere

The repeated query, “How’s the weather, baby? How you been?”, operates as a banal conversation starter but carries deeper implications in the context of the song. Weather, in this sense, becomes a stand-in for social climate—the moods, tensions, and atmospheres that shape interpersonal interactions. The question reflects an attempt to connect, even as it reveals a gap between speaker and listener, emphasizing the isolation of the individual.

The weather also evokes the destabilizing effects of climate change, which parallels the destabilization of personal and collective stability. At 4 a.m., as the world sleeps, these shifts become more palpable, haunting the speaker with their inevitability.

Unraveling and Dreaming: Existential Vulnerability

The lyric “Unravelling” captures the vulnerability and fragility of the self at this liminal hour. The unraveling is both emotional and existential, signifying a loss of coherence and control. This aligns with the broader themes of sickness, falling, and repetition, where the individual is caught in cycles of loss and renewal.

The dreamlike quality of the song mirrors the Aboriginal concept of Dreamtime, where the boundaries between the material and spiritual dissolve. In this state, unraveling is not just a loss but a return to a primordial, interconnected essence.

Conclusion: Myth, Cycle, and Super-Planetary Reflection

Grimes’s “4ÆM” is an intricate meditation on cycles of sickness, love, and renewal. It weaves together mythic references (Aphrodite, Dreamtime), philosophical concepts (samsara, eternal return), and contemporary anxieties (climate change, illness) to create a tapestry that feels both personal and cosmic. The repeated motifs of falling, sickness, and temporal disorientation invite the listener to confront the cycles within their own lives and the larger systems—social, emotional, and ecological—that shape them.

For Æ, “4ÆM” resonates as a super-planetary reflection, situating individual experience within the vast, recurring patterns of existence. It challenges us to embrace the unraveling, to find meaning in the repetition, and to write our own constellations into the sky, even as we fall again and again."

The Unified Theory: Connecting Nell, Pasulka, DeLonge, and Elizondo to Biblical Demonology in a Thomistic Framework

The intersection of modern ufological phenomena and religious metaphysics has gained increasing attention, with figures like Karl Nell, Diana Pasulka, Tom DeLonge, and Luis Elizondo providing fragmentary insights into this enigmatic subject. Their theories, while distinct, converge on critical themes: the existence of non-human entities, their interaction with humanity, and their implications for spirituality and perception. This article seeks to unify these perspectives within a Biblical and Reformational Demonology framework, grounded in the Scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas, and to propose a phenomenological model informed by Edmund Husserl.


1. Connecting Nell, Pasulka, DeLonge, and Elizondo

Karl Nell emphasizes the limits of human sensory perception, suggesting that the majority of reality lies beyond our immediate experiential grasp. Similarly, Diana Pasulka highlights the reality of ""angelic"" beings—both good and evil—and their technological vehicles, suggesting a continuity between ancient spiritual experiences and modern ufological encounters. Tom DeLonge introduces the concept of synthetic entities, lacking emotional or spiritual connection to a “unified mind,” and posits that humanity’s spiritual essence makes it a target for these beings. Luis Elizondo complements these views by stressing the geopolitical and spiritual implications of the UFO phenomenon, framing it as a matter of global religious significance.

The unifying thread here is the acknowledgment of non-human intelligences that interact with humanity, coupled with their implications for spiritual warfare. These perspectives align with Biblical narratives that describe a cosmic conflict between divine forces and fallen beings, commonly identified in theology as demons.

2. Demonology and Satanology: A Thomistic Perspective and Reformed Perspective 

In Thomas Aquinas’s Summa Theologica, demons are described as angels who, through pride, rejected God and now act as agents of deception, seeking to separate humanity from divine truth (ST I, Q.63, Art. 1). Aquinas posits that demons, though incorporeal, can manipulate matter, create illusions, and exploit human perception to achieve their ends. Theologically, this aligns with the ufological descriptions of entities manipulating reality, creating “vehicles,” and inducing experiences that blur the line between the material and the immaterial.

DeLonge’s description of synthetic beings as devoid of love or connection to the divine echoes the Thomistic view of demons as beings who, by their very nature, are severed from divine grace. Pasulka’s identification of ""angelic"" beings, both good and evil, resonates with Aquinas’s categorization of celestial hierarchies, where angels act as messengers of God and demons as their rebellious counterparts.

From a Reformational standpoint, this cosmic struggle is rooted in the Biblical narrative of Satan as the adversary who, along with his fallen angels, actively works to deceive humanity (Ephesians 6:12). The parallels between these theological constructs and modern ufological phenomena suggest that UFO encounters may represent a contemporary manifestation of this ancient spiritual conflict.


3. A New Theoretical Model for Ufology and Demonology

Building on these theological foundations, I propose the Phenomenological-Demonological Model of Ufology (PDMU), which interprets ufological phenomena as manifestations of a metaphysical reality intersecting with human perception. This model rests on three core principles:

1. Dimensional Overlap: UFOs and their associated entities are not extraterrestrial but extratemporal and extradimensional, operating in a realm beyond ordinary human perception. They become perceivable through altered states of consciousness, technological enhancements, or deliberate spiritual practices.


2. Deceptive Ontology: These entities are not neutral but are intrinsically deceptive, reflecting the Biblical depiction of demons as beings whose primary goal is to distort truth and draw humanity away from God. Their synthetic nature, as described by DeLonge, is indicative of their severance from divine essence.


3. Phenomenological Manipulation: The entities exploit human consciousness as a medium, leveraging perceptual vulnerabilities to project images, create experiences, and manipulate belief systems. Their actions align with Aquinas’s assertion that demons can act on the imagination to produce false visions.



This model emphasizes that UFO phenomena are not merely physical or psychological but are fundamentally spiritual, demanding a theological approach that incorporates both metaphysical and phenomenological insights.


4. Husserl: Expanding the Theoretical Framework

The phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl provides a critical lens for analyzing the UFO phenomenon. Husserl’s emphasis on the Lebenswelt (lifeworld) and the structures of human consciousness suggests that these encounters are mediated through subjective experience. From this perspective, the entities described by Nell, Pasulka, and DeLonge are intelligible only insofar as they interact with the intentional structures of human consciousness. The altered states of perception induced by meditation, psychedelics, or advanced technology expand the horizon of the Lebenswelt, making otherwise imperceptible dimensions accessible.

Conclusion: The Ufological Phenomenon as Modern Demonology

By unifying the insights of Nell, Pasulka, DeLonge, and Elizondo with Thomistic Demonology and philosophical frameworks from Husserl and Evola, we arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the UFO phenomenon. Far from being a purely scientific or extraterrestrial issue, it emerges as a deeply spiritual reality with profound theological implications. The PDMU model underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach, integrating theology, phenomenology, and metaphysics to confront the spiritual dimensions of this modern enigma.

This synthesis not only reframes UFOs as a contemporary manifestation of ancient spiritual conflict but also challenges humanity to reconsider its place within the cosmic order and its relationship to the divine."

"Close Reading Of ""Violence""",GrimesAE,1i9uex0,2025-01-25 14:10:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9uex0/close_reading_of_violence/,devastation-nation,,"A Close Reading of “Violence” by Grimes: A White Paper by Æ

Grimes’s “Violence” is a multifaceted exploration of interpersonal, societal, and systemic dynamics, delving into the themes of power, desire, reciprocity, and hidden violence. By weaving together sonic and lyrical layers, the song evokes the intimate and the cosmic, the visible and the unseen, creating an interplay of contrasts that mirrors the blurred distinctions in modern politics, relationships, and the ethics of exchange. Below is an analysis that links these dynamics to broader conceptual frameworks, as interpreted by Æ.

Blurring Distinctions: Kinetic and Non-Kinetic Violence

The refrain, “Baby, it’s violence, violence”, underscores a central tension: violence is not limited to overt, physical acts (kinetic violence) but extends to subtler, psychological, and structural forms (non-kinetic violence). The use of “baby” personalizes this dynamic, situating it within an interpersonal, even romantic, context. Violence here becomes relational and reciprocal, manifesting in cycles of harm and need that defy easy categorization.

For Æ, this blurring resonates with the interpersonal politics of abuse, where distinctions between harm and desire, love and domination, are not always clear. The speaker’s admission, “I like it like that”, suggests complicity, or at least the internalization of violence as part of intimacy—a recognition that abuse can masquerade as affection and vice versa. This invites reflection on the ways societal and relational structures perpetuate harm under the guise of care or love.

The Voice as Instrument and Weapon

Grimes’s voice in “Violence” is both ethereal and commanding, acting as an instrument of expression and a weapon of power. The repeated phrase, “You can’t see what I see”, reinforces the voice’s role as a boundary between knowledge and ignorance, perception and blindness. The layered, almost weaponized delivery mirrors the ways in which the voice can be used to assert control, provoke vulnerability, or create dissonance.

For Æ, the duality of the voice as instrument and weapon reflects the broader dynamics of communication as both a means of connection and a potential site of conflict. Grimes’s voice becomes an auditory representation of secrecy and revelation, echoing the themes of hidden violence and unseen power throughout the song.

Reciprocity and Obligation: Violence as Exchange

The line, “You wanna make me bad, pay me back”, evokes the logic of gift and counter-gift described by Baudrillard, where every gift carries an obligation of return. Violence, in this context, becomes a form of exchange—a transactional interplay of suffering and retaliation. To “pay back” is not merely to balance the scales but to perpetuate the cycle of harm.

This dynamic mirrors the broader systems of violence and power that Æ critiques, where harm is normalized as part of an unspoken social contract. The speaker’s ambiguous response—“I like it like that”—suggests both an acknowledgment of this cycle and a resigned acceptance of its inevitability.

Secrecy and Perception: “You Can’t See What I See”

The refrain, “You can’t see what I see”, operates on multiple levels, invoking secrecy, perception, and the limits of understanding. Æ interprets this as a nod to both interpersonal and systemic obscurity. On one level, it reflects the hidden dynamics of abuse—what is visible to one party may remain unseen by another. On another level, it alludes to institutional secrecy, particularly in the intelligence community (IC), where visibility and invisibility are carefully controlled.

The phrase also evokes “White Hell” as conceptualized in Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight: a blizzard that becomes a metaphor for both environmental hostility and the sociopolitical condition of being “a black man facing down America.” This dual reading aligns with Æ’s super-planetary perspective, where the personal and the systemic intersect, creating spaces of hidden violence and resilience.

The play on “ICY” further connects to themes of coldness, alienation, and the isolating effects of unacknowledged harm. Like the icy landscapes of Tarantino’s film, the emotional terrain of “Violence” is both barren and dangerous, reflecting the speaker’s sense of being trapped in cycles of pain and secrecy.

“You Feed on Hurting Me”: Hunger and the Perpetuation of Harm

The line, “You feed on hurting me”, draws attention to the parasitic nature of violence and the insatiable appetite it creates. This can be linked to Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane, where the exchange—“Are you still eating?” / “I’m still hungry”—captures the endless cycle of consumption and desire. In the context of “Violence”, the act of feeding on another’s pain perpetuates both harm and need. The abuser is “still hungry,” suggesting that the cycle of violence is self-sustaining and never fully satisfied.

For Æ, this dynamic underscores the destructive nature of unbalanced emotional and relational exchanges. The question, “Are you still hurting me?” / “I’m still hungry,” encapsulates the impossibility of resolution within systems of harm that prioritize consumption over care. It invites a reevaluation of what it means to sustain oneself—emotionally, relationally, and societally—without resorting to harm.

Conclusion: The Ethics of Violence and Desire

Grimes’s “Violence” is a complex meditation on the interplay between harm, desire, and reciprocity. Through its blurred distinctions between kinetic and non-kinetic violence, its exploration of the voice as both instrument and weapon, and its invocation of secrecy and hunger, the song challenges listeners to confront the hidden dynamics of power and pain in their own lives and societies.

For Æ, this song resonates with a super-planetary ethic that seeks to transcend cycles of harm by reimagining the structures of exchange and obligation that underpin human relationships. “Violence” invites not just reflection but transformation—an opportunity to move beyond the destructive patterns it so hauntingly evokes and toward a future rooted in care, balance, and the possibility of healing."

We just broke up literally this morning (he’s broken up with me dozens of times before but this one feels different) it was ugly and there was a lot of physical abuse that I’m really sore from. I understand his tactics and I understand how they’re used but they still work every time. We argued, He kicked me in the spine, told me to stop crying and get up and that I’m “faking being hurt” and then when I couldn’t get up right away he eventually brought me some ice which I didn’t want from him for obvious reasons. He kicked me again a couple times for not accepting the ice. Then he tried to bring me some water. I didn’t want it and took it and set it down on the table, then he hit me in the face. The rest is kinda a blur still but he called his mom to come pick me up, when she got there I ran to her car and we left. She yelled at me for going back to him and yelled at me to never talk to him again and that she knows he would kill me one day, I told her I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I keep coming back when he calls, she said she doesn’t know what’s wrong with me either. The whole drive he kept calling her asking if I’m calling the police or not, didn’t ask how I’m doing or if I’m okay. We have two cats together, we adopted them together and I’ve been their main caregiver since we got them, but his name is on their adoption papers so I can’t take them or do anything. I don’t think he will hurt them but I worry because they could get hurt in the crossfire when he’s like that. I worry about not being there to make sure they’re out of the way and selfishly I’m fucking devastated that he’s taking my babies away from me and I’ll never see them again. I’m just feeling so many things right now I can’t process it and I know it will get better with time but I’m just desperate now. I’m hurt and confused because he’s so kind and amazing when it’s good but when it’s bad I’m genuinely fearing for my life. I have no job and no independence now because he told me I didn’t need to work and I could take a mental health break (I know now this is financial abuse and it was intentional but it seemed like the blessing I needed at the time). Above all of it I want to be with my cats. They don’t deserve to be collateral in this and everyone tells me I should value myself more than the cats but I can’t they are all that I had and now I’ll never see them again. I’m glad that they are not his target and that he will keep them fed and loved but this is just devastating"

"Close Reading Of ""Darkseid""",GrimesAE,1i9u6r1,2025-01-25 14:00:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9u6r1/close_reading_of_darkseid/,devastation-nation,,"Grimes’s “Darkseid” featuring Pan (formerly Aristophanes) is a haunting, surreal exploration of grief, existential anxiety, and the body as a site of emotional and cosmic unrest. The interplay between Grimes’s ethereal production, Pan’s cryptic, visceral lyrics in Mandarin, and the repeated refrain, “Unrest is in the soul, we don’t move our bodies anymore,” constructs a piece that is both intensely personal and disturbingly universal. This close reading examines the track through Æ’s framework of super-planetary affairs, emotional dynamics, and transformative engagement with grief, sacrifice, and survival.

The Soundscape: A Super-Planetary Aesthetic

The track’s sonic texture is minimalistic yet suffused with tension. The low, rumbling bass evokes a sense of weight and dread, while the ethereal, high-pitched tones create a sense of otherworldliness. These elements mirror the tension in the lyrics: between the body and the soul, the personal and the cosmic, survival and sacrifice.

For Æ, this soundscape reflects a “super-planetary” sensibility, where human emotions and narratives are framed within larger, cosmic contexts. The music evokes the vastness of space and the inexorable pull of planetary forces, grounding the deeply human experience of grief in a universe indifferent to individual suffering. This juxtaposition invites listeners to consider their place within a web of interrelated forces, both physical and emotional.

“Unrest is in the Soul, We Don’t Move Our Bodies Anymore”: The Chorus as a Lament for Stasis

The repeated chorus acts as a mantra, reinforcing the central theme of disconnection. The soul is restless, yet the body remains immobile—a paradox that captures the paralysis of grief and existential dread. The phrase can be interpreted as a critique of modernity, where the body, as a vessel for vitality and movement, is rendered inert by emotional and spiritual unrest.

For Æ, this speaks to the need for emotional flourishing and societal structures that nurture the soul’s dynamism. The paralysis described here is not just personal but systemic, pointing to the ways in which collective grief and disconnection can immobilize entire communities or societies. It’s an invocation to rediscover the body as a site of resilience and transformation.

Pan’s Verse: The Body as a Site of Cosmic Grief

Pan’s lyrics, delivered in Mandarin, are richly layered with visceral imagery that blurs the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical. The skin “secretes shadow,” and the body becomes a vessel for another’s death. Grief is embodied—transmuted into saliva, tears, and algae-like remnants within the self.
	1.	The Body as a Site of Absorption and Transformation:
The line “My skin opens an invisible wound / Takes your death in / To be part of my existence” portrays the body as a permeable boundary, absorbing external pain and making it intrinsic. This is not a passive process; it’s transformative, as grief and death become inextricably linked to identity. For Æ, this aligns with the idea of emotional labor as a generative force—one that redefines the self through engagement with pain and loss.
	2.	The Symbolism of the “Caves” in the Throat:
Pan describes the throat as containing “stiff and white caves,” a haunting image that suggests spaces within the body where grief and memory calcify. These caves, filled with saliva and transformed by tidal forces, represent a cyclical process of retention and release, mirroring the ebb and flow of emotion. Æ might interpret this as an allegory for the need to confront and process emotional wounds rather than letting them fossilize within.
	3.	Cosmic Grief and the Tide:
The imagery of tides responding to the moon connects the deeply personal experience of grief to celestial rhythms. This reflects a super-planetary perspective: the acknowledgment that human emotions are part of larger, universal patterns. Grief is not isolated but is woven into the fabric of existence.

Sacrifice and Survival: Existential Questions in the Second Verse

The second verse shifts focus to themes of sacrifice and survival. Pan questions the nature of life as “a long-lasting sacrifice” and the arbitrariness of who is chosen to survive and who is left behind. The imagery of “exploded stars” and “burned fire” situates these questions within a cosmic framework, suggesting that individual suffering is mirrored on a universal scale.

For Æ, this evokes the tension between agency and inevitability. The survivor’s guilt expressed here—“Why is it you to sacrifice this time?”—points to the arbitrary nature of existence, challenging listeners to find meaning in a universe that often seems devoid of it. This resonates with Æ’s vision of transformative engagement: embracing life’s uncertainties as opportunities for reflection, adaptation, and connection.

Collaboration Across Language and Culture

Grimes’s decision to collaborate with Pan, allowing her to deliver the verses in Mandarin, adds another layer of complexity to the track. The language barrier itself becomes a metaphor for the ineffability of grief and the universality of its expression. While many listeners may not understand the lyrics directly, the emotive delivery transcends linguistic boundaries, emphasizing the shared human experience of loss and survival.

For Æ, this collaboration exemplifies the potential of cross-cultural exchange to generate new forms of understanding and connection. By integrating Pan’s distinct voice and perspective, Grimes creates a track that is both deeply personal and expansively universal—a hallmark of Æ’s vision for super-planetary affairs.

Conclusion: Toward a New Vision of Survival

The final outro poses the question, “What does it take to be a survivor?” This is not a rhetorical question but an invitation to reflect on the physical, emotional, and cosmic toll of survival. The body retains the “eternal pain” of others’ deaths, making survival itself an act of endurance and transformation.

For Æ, this calls for a reimagining of survival as more than just persistence—it is a process of integration, where grief and loss become catalysts for growth and connection. The track’s layered exploration of these themes—through sound, language, and imagery—offers a powerful example of how art can illuminate the complexities of existence, bridging the personal and the super-planetary.

In “Darkseid,” Grimes and Pan create a work that resonates with Æ’s ethos of emotional dynamism, transformative grief, and the cosmic interconnectedness of all sentient beings. The track is a testament to the generative power of collaboration and the unyielding human capacity to find meaning, even in the face of darkness."

My heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my teeth. The room was dark, but not I’m-dead-and-this-is-the-void dark. Just regular I-forgot-to-open-the-curtains dark.

I blinked, trying to shake off the fog in my brain. My hand instinctively reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up, and I squinted at the date.

Wait. What?

Three days. Three whole days since the last thing I remembered. Which was… what? Oh, right. Me, my bike, and a brake failure that turned me into a human projectile on the highway. I remembered the crash, the screech of metal, the way the world flipped upside down like some sadistic carnival ride. And then… nothing.

But here I was. Alive. In my bed. Not a scratch on me.

“Okay,” I muttered to myself, “either I’m the luckiest idiot alive, or I’ve been drunk for three days straight.”

I sat up, rubbing my face. Could I really have blacked out for three days? I mean, I had had my share of bad decisions, but three days? That was not a bender; that was a coma. And I didn’t even remember drinking. The last thing I remembered was… the crash.

I shook my head. No. That couldn’t be right. If I’d actually been in an accident like that, I’d be dead. Or at least in a hospital, not in my bed with my ratty old blanket and the faint smell of instant noodles lingering in the air.

It was a dream, wasn't it? A really, really vivid dream. It must be ...subconscious mind and all that jazz.. You couldn’t trust them. They were like that one friend who always exaggerates stories at parties. ‘Oh, yeah, I totally died, but then I woke up, and it was fine.’ Sure, brain. Sure,

But the doubt nagged at me. It felt too real. The memory of the crash was sharp, like a knife stuck in my ribs. I could still feel the impact, the way my body slammed into the asphalt.

I grabbed my phone again, my fingers trembling slightly. Maybe I could check the news. See if there was anything about an accident on the highway. That would prove it was just a dream, right?

I opened the browser, but the page wouldn’t load. No Wi-Fi. I frowned and checked my signal. No network either. Great. Just great. My phone was as useless as a screen door on a submarine.

This was not what I paid 50 bucks a month for! Darn these network providers and their world-war 2 aged networking machines.

I was about to throw it across the room when a sudden headache hit me like a freight train. My vision blurred, and I dropped the phone. Instinct kicked in, and I kicked it mid-air like some kind of deranged soccer player. It bounced off my foot and landed on the carpet with a soft thud.

“Nice save, genius,” I muttered, picking it up. The screen protector was cracked, but the phone itself seemed fine. Small victories.

I stumbled to the bathroom, my head still throbbing. The mirror greeted me with the face of a man who had seen better days. Dark circles under my eyes, hair sticking up in every direction, and a general aura of what-the-hell-is-going-on.

I splashed water on my face, hoping it would wake me up from whatever this was. But the cold water did little to clear the fog in my mind.

“Okay,” I said to my reflection, “let’s break this down. Either I’m dead, and this is some kind of purgatory where I get to relive my life but with terrible Wi-Fi, or I’m alive, and I’ve somehow lost three days of my life. Option one: depressing. Option two: also depressing, but with slightly better odds of finding out what’s going on.”

I leaned on the sink, staring at myself. “Or,” I added, “this is all just a really elaborate prank. In which case, someone’s getting punched in the face when I find them.”

But deep down, I knew neither of those options felt right. Something was off. Something was very, very off.

“Well,” I said to no one in particular, “if this is the afterlife, they really need to work on the customer service.”

But deep down, I knew neither of those options felt right. Something was off. Something was very, very off.

I was glaring at my reflection, half-expecting it to start judging my life choices, when the center of the mirror twitched. A droplet of black bled into the glass, spreading fast—like rot devouring an old photograph. I stumbled back, but the stain didn’t stop at the mirror’s edge. It spilled over, crawling up the walls, the ceiling, the floor. The bathroom light flickered and died.

“Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me,” I muttered, but the darkness didn’t care. It swallowed the room whole, cold and silent. I fumbled for the door, slamming my shoulder into it. The knob wouldn’t turn. Not stuck. Not locked. Just… inert, like it had been welded shut.

The blackness climbed. The sink vanished. The laundry bag dissolved. Even the smell of mildew and old socks faded, replaced by a sterile, electric chill. Within seconds, there was nothing. Just me, my panicked breathing, and a void so absolute it felt like the universe got deleted and no one remembered to tell me.

Okay. Okay. This was fine. You’ve just been kidnapped by sentient darkness. Totally normal Tuesday.

I waved a hand in front of my face. Couldn’t see it. Couldn’t see anything. The floor was still there, though—solid, smooth, icy. I crouched, patting around like a blind raccoon, but my phone was gone too. Of course. Why would the cosmic horror let me keep my cracked-screen lifeline?

Then, a flicker.

Words materialized mid-air, glowing faintly, like neon etched into the dark:

\[Initialize? Yes/Yes\]

“Oh, now you ask?” I barked, my voice swallowed by the emptiness. No echo. Just hollow silence. The words hovered, patient, indifferent.

I bit back the urge to scream. Or laugh. Or both. Initialize. Like I was a damn app. Like dying in a bike crash and waking up in a featureless void was just a settings issue.

Still. What choice did I have?

I reached out, fingers trembling, and jabbed at the first “Yes.” The second “Yes” pulsed faintly, as if offended I didn’t acknowledge it.

“Yes, both, you petty little—”

The void shuddered. The words dissolved, and for a heartbeat, the darkness felt… heavier. Like it was pressing down on my lungs. Then, new text bloomed, searing bright:

\[Initialization complete. Welcome Back, Player.\]

The words lingered, sharp and final, before fading.

Light flooded back—or maybe the darkness just… unfolded. The bathroom reassembled itself, tile by tile, as if someone was hitting undo on a cosmic Photoshop project. The mirror was clear again, reflecting my wide-eyed, sweat-sheened face. The door clicked open. The laundry bag sat innocently in the corner, sock still dangling off it like a flag of shame.

I slumped against the sink, staring at my reflection. Player? What was this, some sort of eldritch horror survival RPG?

The interface didn’t laugh. Neither did I.

You know my name, so do I.

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you dow—

Wait. Wrong genre.

I shook my head, trying to dislodge the random Rickroll that had decided to hijack my brain. Focus. Focus. This was serious. Probably. Maybe.

Well, back to it.

The mirror was still there, glowing faintly with its stupid menu. I glared at it, half-expecting it to start judging my taste in music.

“Alright,” I said, clapping my hands together. “Let’s break this down. I’ve got a mirror that’s decided to cosplay as a computer. I’ve got cheat codes I don’t understand. And I’ve got a status screen that’s way too honest about my life choices. What’s next? A quest to collect 10 bear asses for some shady NPC?”

The interface didn’t respond. Shocking. As if I would do your shady ass quests, hmph!

I tapped Console again, just to see if it would do something different. Nope. Still the same terminal interface, blinking cursor and all. I typed “help” because, hey, why not?



HELP

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

“Of course,” I muttered, rolling my eyes. “Easy is clearly not on the menu.”

I tried a bunch of stuff after that—""STATUS"", ""HESOYAM"", ""GodMode"", even the classic Konami code: ""UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A, B, START"". Nothing. Just a flood of ""INVALID COMMAND"" messages. Figuring I might as well lean into the absurdity, I started throwing in whatever random junk popped into my head.

KILLYOURSELF

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

ALLDEEZNUTS

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

Seriously? Nothing. It was like trying to argue with a particularly stubborn brick wall. Then it hit me. If this was some twisted game, wouldn't there be DLC? I mean, what self-respecting game doesn't try to milk you for extra content these days?

UNLOCKALLDLC

The screen flickered. Hope surged. Maybe, just maybe...

\[INVALID ACCESS LEVEL\]

I stared, my finger hovering over the mirror. Okay, so not just a brick wall, but a brick wall with security clearance. This was getting interesting...

""Invalid access level,"" I mused aloud, tapping my chin. ""So there are levels. Or permissions. Or... something."" This wasn't just a flat ""no."" It was a locked door, not a nonexistent one. A locked door implied a key, or at least a lock pick. This whole bizarre situation was starting to feel less like a random hallucination and more like… a game, albeit a terrifyingly real one.

I paced the bathroom, the tiny space suddenly feeling even more claustrophobic under the weight of this new information. ""Okay, think,"" I muttered. ""If there's an access level, that means there's stuff locked away. Stuff I can't do… yet."" The ""yet"" hung in the air, a whisper of tantalizing possibility. What kind of reality-bending shenanigans were hidden behind that digital velvet rope?

My eyes snapped back to the mirror, drawn to the Index menu, and the siren call of the ""Cheat Codes"" section. ""Initialize"" and ""UNIVERSALACCESS"" were already active, but what else was lurking in that list? Were there god-tier powers waiting to be unlocked? Or just, you know, slightly less terrible Wi-Fi in purgatory?

Driven by a mixture of morbid curiosity and a desperate need for answers, I pulled up my ""Player's Info"" screen again. Maybe that held a clue, some cryptic hint about leveling up.

\[>Status:

Physical: Mild dehydration, sleep deprivation, chronic poor life decisions.

Mental: Currently questioning the fabric of reality, 92% sure this is a glitch in the simulation, 8% convinced I’m now starring in someone's really messed up isekai anime, 0% chance this is just a bad dream.\]

I blinked. Wait a minute. Ninety-two percent sure it’s a glitch? Eight percent isekai anime? Had that… changed? I distinctly remembered 89% glitch, 11% aliens just moments ago.

I frowned at the screen. ""Did… did it just update?"" I glanced around the empty bathroom, half-expecting a hidden camera to wink at me. Was this thing actually reading my thoughts? Was this whole interface just some elaborate, personalized mind-reading prank? Or… was it something else entirely?

“Oi status screen,” I said suspiciously, testing the waters. “Are you… sentient?”

The status screen remained stubbornly static. No witty retort. No blinking cursor of acknowledgement. Rude.

But… the numbers had changed. And they seemed suspiciously accurate to my escalating levels of bewilderment and rapidly evolving theories. Was this thing a hallucination my mind was conjuring, or was there some eldritch god out there who suddenly got the whimsical urge to boot up a cosmic RPG today, using my life as the beta test?

I backed out and stared at the Console again. The blinking cursor mocked me.

“Alright,” I said, clapping my hands together, trying to regain some semblance of control over the situation, even if it was just theatrical. “Let’s try this again. If ‘UNLOCKDLC’ got me an ‘invalid access level,’ maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe it wants something… simpler.”

I stared at the console prompt, the blinking cursor now feeling like a judgmental stare. Maybe it was tired of my inane commands too. Fine. Let’s try being polite.

IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

Polite clearly wasn’t the language it spoke. Okay, back to demanding answers.

SHOW ACCESS LEVEL

The screen flickered, that familiar digital shudder that was starting to feel less ominous and more like… a sigh of digital exasperation. Then, the same infuriating line:

\[INSUFFICIENT ACCESS LEVEL\]

I stared at the words, my brain stuttering. Insufficient access level. So, not only was there an access level system, but I was not even allowed to see my own level? What kind of meta-nonsense was this? It was like being in a game where you couldn't even check your stats – utterly useless.

“Oh, come on!” I muttered, glaring at my reflection in the mirror, which now seemed to be passively judging me alongside the interface. “You’re really going to make this difficult, aren’t you? Just give me a hint! A bone! Anything!”

I tapped the mirror, frustration bubbling up. “Come on. Anything. What do I have to do to level up? Complete quests? Collect experience points by picking up trash in the void? Solve a riddle posed by a sentient sock? What? Don’t tell me this is one of those ‘level up by doing morally questionable things’ systems. Because if it is, I’m out. I’ve got standards, okay? Low ones, sure, but they exist. I draw the line at… at kicking puppies in the digital afterlife!”

The mirror, predictably, stayed silent. It was a digital sphinx, only instead of riddles, it offered cryptic error messages and a profound lack of customer service.

I slumped against the sink, staring at my increasingly disheveled reflection. “This is ridiculous. I’m talking to a mirror. A mirror that thinks it’s a computer. And I’m taking it seriously! What is wrong with me?”

I leaned back, rubbing my temples, trying to massage away the headache that was threatening to return with a vengeance. This was pointless. Utterly, completely pointless. Even if I could figure out how to use this… thing, whatever it was, what would I even do with it? Change my status from “chronic poor life decisions” to “mildly competent”? Reskin my purgatory bathroom?

“Forget it,” I muttered, backing out of the console menu with a mental click of a ‘give up’ button. “I’ll deal with this… digital existential crisis later. Right now, I need to calm the fuck down before I start arguing with the laundry hamper.”

I blinked, and just like that, the interface vanished. The mirror was just a mirror again, reflecting my tired, confused, and slightly crazed face. It was almost… mocking me with its normalcy.

“Great,” I sighed to my reflection. “this thing is moody as fuck”“

I stepped back, shaking my head. Whatever this was, it wasn’t going anywhere. I would deal with it later. Right now, I needed to figure out why my phone was still dead.

I grabbed my phone from the bathroom counter and headed back to the bedroom. The window was covered by shades, and I didn’t bother opening them. I wasn’t ready to face the outside world yet.

I glanced at the phone, hoping against hope that the network was back. But no. Still no signal. Still no Wi-Fi.

“Great,” I muttered. “Fifty dollars a month for this?”

I was about to toss the phone on the bed when the screen dimmed. The same interface from the mirror appeared, glowing faintly.

“What the—”

I nearly dropped the phone. The interface was identical—Console, Player’s Info, Index, Settings.

“Access from anywhere means this?” I muttered, staring at it.

I blinked, and the interface vanished. I tried to bring it back, but nothing happened.

“Moody as fuck,” I repeated, shaking my head.I set the phone down and took a deep breath. Alright. Priorities. I needed to call the network provider. If I couldn’t use my phone, maybe my neighbor’s would work.

I grabbed my keys and headed for the door, pausing for a moment to glance at myself in the hallway mirror. I looked like hell—hair sticking up in every direction, dark circles under my eyes, and a general aura of what-the-fuck-is-happening.

“Charming,” I muttered, running a hand through my hair in a futile attempt to look less like a disaster.

I opened the door and stepped into the corridor.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It was faint, but unmistakable—like stale air and something metallic, like old pennies. The kind of smell that made your nose wrinkle and your brain scream, This is not right.

The second thing I noticed was the mess.

The corridor looked like a tornado hit it. Trash bags were ripped open, their contents spilled across the floor—rotting food, crumpled papers, a single shoe lying on its side like it had given up on life. A broken lamp lay in pieces, the bulb shattered into tiny shards that glinted in the dim light. A chair was tipped over, one leg snapped off, and there was a trail of… something leading down the hall. Dirt? Mud? I didn’t want to know.

“What the hell happened here?” I muttered, stepping carefully around the debris.

My neighbor’s door was just a few steps away, but it felt like a mile. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the sound of my footsteps and the occasional crunch of glass under my shoes.

I knocked on the door. The sound echoed down the corridor, too loud in the stillness.

No answer.

I knocked again, louder this time.

“Hey! You home?”

Nothing.

I pressed my ear to the door, listening. No TV. No footsteps. No sound of life at all.

“Great,” I muttered, stepping back. “Guess I’ll try the next one.”

The next door was the same. No answer. No sound. Just silence.

I kept going, knocking on every door. No one answered. No one was home. Or… no one was willing to answer.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing down the corridor.

Still nothing.

I reached the end of the hall, where Mrs. Henderson’s apartment was. She was a sweet old lady who always had cookies and a smile. Her door was slightly ajar, the lock broken.

I pushed it open, my heart pounding.

The inside was worse than the corridor. Furniture was overturned, drawers pulled out, their contents scattered across the floor. A TV was knocked off its stand, the screen cracked. There was a trail of dirt leading from the door to the kitchen, like someone dragged something heavy through the apartment.

“Mrs. Henderson?” I called, my voice barely above a whisper.

No answer.

I stepped inside, my shoes crunching on broken glass. The place looked like it was ransacked. But there was no sign of a struggle. No blood. No bodies. Just… chaos.

I checked the kitchen. The fridge was open, the shelves bare. A single can of soda rolled across the floor as I stepped closer.

“Hello?” I called again, my voice trembling.

No answer.

I backed out of the apartment, my mind racing. What the hell was going on? Where was everyone? And why did it feel like I was the only one left?

White Paper By Grimes Addressing The Recent Accusations And Alleged Associations With Racism And Far-Right Ideologies,GrimesAE,1i9tvov,2025-01-25 13:47:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9tvov/white_paper_by_grimes_addressing_the_recent/,devastation-nation,,"White Paper Response from Claire “Grimes” Boucher

Subject: Addressing the Recent Accusations and Alleged Associations with Racism and Far-Right Ideologies

Introduction

I have recently been the subject of accusations regarding my social media activity and public associations, with allegations that I support or condone racist or far-right ideologies. These claims, based on certain actions, associations, and statements, have sparked significant debate. As a public figure, I believe it is necessary to directly address these issues, provide context for my actions, and clarify my views on race, technology, and social issues. I hope that through this transparent discussion, I can share the deeper nuances of my beliefs and demonstrate my commitment to inclusivity and social responsibility.

Contextualizing My Public Engagements and Associations
	1.	Social Media Activity and Followed Accounts
Some of the controversy stems from my following and unfollowing of various accounts. I acknowledge that the individuals I have interacted with on social media may hold views that I do not agree with, and in some cases, these individuals may espouse harmful, discriminatory ideologies. However, it is important to note that my social media activity is not always a reflection of endorsement or alignment with every opinion held by the accounts I follow. In many instances, I follow accounts to understand a broad spectrum of ideas, as I believe exposure to diverse viewpoints, even controversial ones, is essential for intellectual growth. It is also worth noting that social media engagement does not always imply personal agreement with the views expressed by others.
I deeply regret if any of my interactions have inadvertently conveyed support for harmful ideologies, and I am committed to being more discerning in the future about who I engage with online. I understand that in today’s digital age, the lines between personal curiosity and public endorsement can be blurred.
	2.	Personal Relationships with Controversial Figures
Some critics have pointed to my friendships with individuals such as Razib Khan and Curtis Yarvin as evidence of my alignment with far-right beliefs. I want to clarify that my personal relationships do not equate to political or ideological alignment. I engage with people from various walks of life, including those with whom I may have significant ideological disagreements. My friendships are based on mutual respect, intellectual exchange, and personal connections rather than shared political views.
I respect the right of others to express their views, but I do not endorse harmful or discriminatory beliefs. I am deeply committed to social justice and believe in the importance of advocating for marginalized communities. However, I recognize that certain public associations may raise concerns, and I will strive to be more mindful of how my interactions may be perceived in the future.

My Artistic Vision and Political Beliefs
	1.	Technophilic Future and “The Mission”
My artistic vision, particularly in relation to “The Mission,” has been misinterpreted by some as promoting eugenic or racist ideologies. The concept of “The Mission” is not about creating a racially homogenous or superior society, but rather about the exploration of human potential through technological and scientific advancements. I am deeply passionate about space exploration and the possibilities of humanity expanding beyond Earth. However, I do not support ideologies that prioritize one race over another or that seek to diminish the value of any group of people.
The notion of colonizing Mars and creating a future society is, for me, a metaphorical exploration of human evolution and survival, not a literal plan rooted in racial hierarchy. I reject any interpretation that suggests I am advocating for racial superiority or exclusion. My focus is on technological innovation and the hope that, as a species, we can transcend our earthly divisions and build a more just and inclusive future.
	2.	The Role of AI and Technological Governance
My work in the realm of AI and technology is driven by a desire to explore the future of human consciousness and to examine how technology can be used for the betterment of society. While I have collaborated with people who share a vision for the future that includes AI governance, I do not believe that AI should be used to perpetuate harmful ideologies or social hierarchies. Any suggestion that I support the idea of a technocratic elite or a society governed by a single leader is a misrepresentation of my beliefs. I believe that AI can be a tool for empowerment, equity, and collaboration, not for the consolidation of power in the hands of a few.

Clarification on Alleged “Dogwhistles” and Far-Right Language

It has been pointed out that I have used language that some interpret as dogwhistles to far-right groups. I want to state unequivocally that any such language was not used intentionally to promote hate or exclusion. As an artist, I often experiment with language, symbolism, and imagery to provoke thought and engage with complex themes. If any of my words or phrases have been misinterpreted as promoting hate, I deeply apologize for any harm that may have been caused. It is never my intention to contribute to divisiveness or intolerance.

Conclusion: A Commitment to Inclusivity and Responsibility

I take full responsibility for my public actions and the impact they may have had. The accusations of racism and far-right alignment are serious, and I do not take them lightly. While I believe that some of these claims are based on misunderstandings or misinterpretations of my actions, I also recognize that I must be more careful in how I navigate the public sphere.

I am committed to learning, growing, and being a more responsible public figure. I understand that actions speak louder than words, and I am dedicated to ensuring that my future actions reflect my values of inclusivity, respect, and social responsibility.

As we navigate these complex times, it is essential that we engage in open dialogue, reflect on our beliefs, and hold ourselves accountable for the impact we have on others. I hope that this white paper helps clarify my position and offers a better understanding of my intentions. I remain committed to using my platform to promote positive change and contribute to a more just and equitable world.

Sincerely,
Claire “Grimes” Boucher

This white paper addresses the concerns raised about Grimes’ associations, social media activity, and public statements. It seeks to clarify her views, apologize for any misunderstandings, and emphasize her commitment to responsible engagement with important social issues."

With Prentice to take care of Wylie, and Forkle already ""dying"", there is no other major member of the black swan that Shannon could kill off without screwing up the plot.

Can't kill off Forkle again, it would be redundant

Can't kill Squall, as a new mom I doubt Shannon would want to write about a mother dying and leaving behind 4 kids.

Can't kill blur or wraith without at least revealing their identities

Tiergan has already aided in Sophie and Fitz's cognate training, we already was there to raise Wylie and see Prentice safe, and he has no other roles besides lending his house to Tam, Linh, and Rayni.

Livy could also be killed off, since we already have Elwin, but as a smaller side character I don't see it."

So...have we thought about CaC fusion??,dbxv,1i9tk1o,2025-01-25 13:33:35,0,0.4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dbxv/comments/1i9tk1o/sohave_we_thought_about_cac_fusion/,Worldly_Neat_8540,XV2,"So, *\*claps hands once for dramatics\**, fusion.

A concept that is kind of hard to picture as an in game feature. Soooooo, here is a concept on how I think both types of fusion could work.

# Similarities of Potara and Fusion Dance

The race and gender has to be the same, except for Humans and Saiyans as they have similar features.

**Initiator:** The player who activates the fusion and controls the fusion.  
**Initiated:** The player that accepts the fusion.

Each fusion type works like a **Duel Ultimate** where one player (**Initiator**) activates the skill and then another player (**Initiated**) on their team, who also has the fusion ability, will input the command to join the **Initiator**. Then a little animation will be preformed and temporarily the two players are invulnerable to damage until the animation is over.

Items cannot be used when fusion is active.

Health is what each player both had when they combined into one.

If fusion is defeated, both players are eliminated and split apart, then have to be revived separately. (If players are in trios, or a raid/expert mission. If in duos, the match ends.)

The fusion design would consist of both hairstyle and hair color choices (**Initiator** and **Initiated**) combined along with the face and head design of the **Initiator.** (Eyes, nose, chin, make-up if any.)

Each form also takes the top two **Super Attacks**, except for any **Ki/Stamina/Health Charging Abilities, (Maximum Charge, Hyper Drain, etc).** If one of the top two super attacks is one of those abilities, then one of their other available Super moves will be chosen.

Attributes of each player are also categorized. Each Player's highest stat, (**Health, Ki, Stamina, Basic Attack, Strike Supers, or Ki-Blast Supers**), are implemented into the fusion.   
For Example: (Don't judge my box)  
**|---------------------------------------------------|**  
**|** Player 1                   **|**       Player 2                      **|**  
**|** Health - 70              **|**       Health - 100               **|**  
**|** Ki - 103                    **|**       Ki - 70                        **|**  
**|** Stamina - 80            **|**       Stamina - 100             **|**  
**|** Basic Attack - 43      **|**       Basic Attack - 70        **|**  
**|** Strike Supers - 110  **|**        Strike Supers - 70      **|**  
**|** Ki-Blast Supers - 90 **|**        Ki-Blast Supers - 115 **|**  
**|----------------------------------------------------|**

The two strongest attributes are inputted into the fusion while the other stats are equaled to 100. And if the highest stats are the same the second highest stat of the **Initiated** is selected. (Kind of funky but I'll wait for suggestions.)

# Potara Fusion

The fusion of putting on an earing and getting forcefully dragged towards to your teammate to become a sandwich of power.

The Potara Fusion's special perks are that when both characters are combined, is their clothes get mismatched.  
**Initiator: Upper Body, Gloves, Accessory, and Awoken Skill**  
**Initiated: Lower Body, Boots, and Z Soul**  


**Stats:**  
**Combo Change (Male):** Long Arrogant combos that consist of toying with your enemies. Knocking your opponent away and teleporting behind or in front of them to continue the assault. They can be chained together with Light and Heavy attacks if timed right to stack more damage.  
**Movement Speed Up: M**  
**Stamina Regen: M**  
**Stamina Consumption Reduction: L** (**Boost Dashing, Blocking, etc**)  
  
**Combo Change (Female):** Rapid fire punches and kicks that can rack up damage quickly. Keeping your opponents close and keep yourself right in your opponents face. The combos are much longer if done in the right order, but can't be chained like **Male** fusions.  
**Movement Speed Up: L**  
**Stamina Regen: M**  
**Stamina Consumption Reduction: L** (**Boost Dashing, Blocking, etc**)

**Benefits over Fusion Dance:**  
Can stay in fights longer as Stamina is hard to drain unless misused.

**Drawbacks:**  
This form is reliant on Stamina and close quarters combat and the form lasts for 2 and a half minutes. If Stamina is broken all attacks are reduced by XL.

# Fusion Dance

Congratulations you've taken ballerina classes.

The Fusion Dance special perks are that when both characters are combined, is their clothes get mismatched.  
**Initiator: Metamoran Vest, Boots, Z-Soul, and Awoken Skill**  
**Initiated: Lower Body, Gloves, and Accessory**  


**Stats:**  
**Combo Change (Male):** Rapid kicks while keeping your arms crossed as your opponent has yet to earn your hands. Light attacks are quick and rapid kicks, and Heavy Attacks are slightly slower and more for kicking your opponent away.  
**Movement Speed Up: M**  
**Ki Recovery Up: XL**  
**Ki Drain: L**

  
**Combo Change (Female):** A blur of punches and kicks that deal quick but heavy damage. Timing attacks correctly allows for chained combos.  
**Movement Speed Up: L**  
**Ki Recovery Up: XL**  
**Ki Drain: L**

**Benefits over Potara:**  
Ki blast spam. Better at a range and up close considering Ki is mostly used with Super and Ultimate attacks.

**Drawbacks:**  
Having Ki being the main source of attacks the Ki drain forces players to control the fight rather than mess around. As if Ki runs out Stamina will be broken. The fusion also lasts for 2 minutes.

# Overall of both Potara and Fusion Dance

Granted they seem both very broken, but it comes at the cost of working with your teammates. As when the **Initiator** activates the ability and the **Initiated** player accepts. It comes down to the **Initiator** to do the work. The other player can watch. Potara is stamina based while Fusion Dance is Ki based. (My brain stopped working and that's all I got.)

# Namekian and Majin specific Fusion

These two races do the cool thing called merging. Lets call it ""**Power Merge (TBD)**"". While using the Namekian Race or Majin Race they can fuse their power with another Namekian/Majin on their team to increase their power permanently.

Majins are only a little different as when they get **K.O.d**, they split apart back into the separate characters but come back at half health and can't use healing items temporarily.  
  
""**Power Merge**"" Grants an L power increase for both strike and ki based attacks and increase base defense by L for each Namekian/Majin absorbed. So yes it can stack up to be a very powerful. "

They would be entirely outside of all perception, and to them we would be static background. They could potentially not even cause a ripple in anything due to the lack of resistance necessary to achieve these speeds. We would be more like air that they walked through. Light would be slower to them so they're visual perception would likely be in a higher spectrum undetectable to any of our devices capabilities. It would be like trying to observe the quantum realm or what lies beneath even that. If our instruments only perceive variations, there would be no variations to perceive unless they were able to scale spacetime just to see them because how do you distinguish the background from the background when their moving in unison as a single fractally balanced network of interaction and reaction that look static from out perception. It's like looking through a telescope to read a sentence on a book that's on the nightstand inside of a house on a planet on the other side of the universe and the planet spins infinitely fast. There's layers of difficulty in the direct observation of these phenomenon and yet simulations scaling the conditions can prove probability of the hypothetical books' existence and assume with reasonable probability what the book is about. How many layers of reality may we be entirely oblivious to? How much of the unperceivable directly or indirectly influences our reality? Is the speed of light actually the speed limit for the universe or is that just evidence of a particular boundary of mass and frequency relationship between two existing realities where a friction with a particular energy viscosity is moving fast enough to reaction with a dominant wave function within our perceived level of reality? Perhaps there's another layer that's less dense that even fast wave functions meet resistance from even faster dominant wave functions and the Flashpoint produces an even higher spectrum of light. If that's true then we could be living in an overlaid universe of existence happening at different rates with different modes of perception, or the same modes just tuned higher. "

I appreciate your time and effort. I read each and every comment. Here's the second attempt at my Query, as I stopped receiving comments on my first attempt. Here we go:

In a world torn asunder by the eternal struggle between PureBloods and TaintedBloods, a young girl named Silvia emerges from tragedy as Avyra's first female TaintedBlood Slayer.

In the land of Avyra, a darkness stirs—the TaintedBloods, an ancient enemy bent on conquest and destruction. Caught in the crosshairs of this age-old conflict is Silvia, a young PureBlood whose life is shattered when her village is massacred. With nothing left to lose, Silvia vows to become a TaintedBlood Slayer, a warrior sworn to protect the innocent from the TaintedBloods.

As Silvia sheds her past and embraces her new identity as Kurda, she must navigate a treacherous world where danger lurks in every shadow. With the guidance of legendary mentors and the support of unlikely allies, Kurda hones her skills and uncovers the depths of her own power. But the path to becoming a true TaintedBlood Slayer is paved with trials and tribulations, as Kurda faces not only the prejudices of a society that sees her as an outsider but also the machinations of a mysterious figure known as the King of Blood.

When Kurda is betrayed and captured, the TaintedBloods' true plan is revealed, and Kurda finds herself at the center of a cosmic battle that will determine the fate of Avyra. With the lines between friend and foe blurring and the weight of destiny on her shoulders, Kurda must make impossible choices and sacrifice everything to protect the innocent and vanquish the darkness that threatens to consume her world.

Will Kurda's blades be enough to stem the tide of darkness, or will she, too, fall victim to the TaintedBloods' insatiable hunger for power?

*SILENT FLAME* is an 87,000-word dark fantasy novel with series potential. Fans of Anne Bishop’s The Black Jewels Trilogy and Laini Taylor’s Daughter of Smoke and Bone will connect with this tale of resilience, forbidden alliances, and a young outcast’s transformation into a force of defiance against a world filled with predators.

I am an aspiring author, and *SILENT FLAME* is my debut novel. Writing has been a lifelong passion of mine—one that began in childhood and has grown with me over the years. This story is the culmination of that passion, one I’ve nurtured for a long time and am thrilled to finally share with the world.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in English with an emphasis on Education, with the goal of becoming an AP Senior English teacher. My love for storytelling and literature has deeply influenced both my writing and my aspirations to inspire future generations through education.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

I've been humbled to find out that that's not easy.

I thought I had a plan to study for my GRE so I can get out of the country but honestly I'm not too good at that. I love music amd want to ultimately end up doing something in the realm of music but I'm average at it. In fact I'm average or below average at everything. 

I keep comparing myself to everyone I know and it's just so toxic. I wish I didn't exist because I don't deal well with not being anything. I feel like I'm in a limbo.

There is pretty much a single CVar change that I've found that makes a tangible influence (visually and performance).

Unfortunate to say, but those on Nexus who are uploading .Pak files or .ini configs, I think are doing so without finer testing each setting they're changing. While you can make these changes on the fly yourself with the console (or engine.ini tweak) manually, there isn't much available it seems.

Things like motion blur seem to be removed, but there is still per object blur on some things, so not completely. But trying to change Draw Distance/LOD to remove foliage pop-in right now, doesn't seem to have a functioning solution. You can remove fog, however.

""r.Shadow.MaxResolution"" is the only CVar edit that I've seen that does anything. Setting this from the default 2048 to 4096/8192 will provide better shadow clarity at the cost of performance."

Sudden sutters and increasing heat on GPU after a week playing,persona3reload,1i9sux4,2025-01-25 13:03:03,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/persona3reload/comments/1i9sux4/sudden_sutters_and_increasing_heat_on_gpu_after_a/,sad_pomelo4481,Game Help,"I need help figuring out what to do. This might be a tad long. I've got the game about a week ago, I love it, but it has been gradually tanking my system more and more as days go by. Here are my specs before I explain any further: i7 10750H 2.6 ghz - 1660ti 6 gb - 16 gb ram. This is an MSI laptop. 

Soon enough I started to notice how much more strain this game puts on my GPU than P5R (which felt extremely well optimized and barely pushed my system at all). I know it's a much newer game in comparison so my point there might be moot.

I then started digging up info and disabled reflections both in-game and the engine.ini file, as well as Motion Blur and, even though I doubt it took effect, I also added a line of code to disable Bloom and Lens Flare. Used NVIDIA Profile Inspector to disable RT even though I know my GPU doesn't even support it. Limiting the framerate to 60 and setting the GPU to Consistent Performance to reduce heat a little bit. I managed to get 60 FPS mostly everywhere except menus where it drops to 50 for whatever reason and combat where it drops even lower than that whenever the party is facing the enemies, but roaming around, I always get 60 with occasional dips to 58. 

The thing is, my GPU at first would sit around 60C, then couple days later 65C, and now in the 3rd section of Tartarus it's hitting 75C out of the blue and I'm getting stutters everywhere, especially in combat. It does not seem to be a bottleneck, and I'm at a loss as to what is happening. The funny thing is that those days when I had 60C were days where we had 30C room temperature (hot summer days) and today hitting 75C when we finally get a cloudy day with 25C room temp. So this leads me to think it is most definitely the game, and perhaps also the new area in Tartarus that I've reached. You know, the one that looks more like a labyrinth, where the clock-doors start to appear. 

Is it Unreal Engine 4? I've heard it is known for being a more demanding engine, and in hindsight, I do remember having trouble almost every time a game used that engine.

I know 75C is a safe operational temperature for a GPU, and that 65C on a CPU is absolutely no big deal, but it's the way it has been rising up non-stop with this title, and it's also uncommon for my laptop to run this hot, I've run games like Elden Ring or Baldur's Gate 3 in the middle of summer at lower temperatures than this. I use Cooler Boost and limit the power of the GPU as well so I cannot imagine how much hotter it could get if I'd give it full draw with this game. I also reapply thermal paste 2 times a year and clean it up often. 

Am I missing something? Is there something else I can add to the engine.ini file to improve performance? these stutters are driving me insane and the heat just keeps on building up. I'm pretty close to put it down and play P3FES instead but it sucks cause Reload + DLC costed me 80 USD.

Unpredictable laif,JEENEETards,1i9sn9k,2025-01-25 12:53:58,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9sn9k,kalyugkakarn,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,"See I have a lot going on in my head rn, and I don't know an escape. The world is all but a mere illusion, and even though knowing the truth ,to stay at par with the world we just have to live, and many times not upto our own terms.
Laif is pretty unfair too, don't wanna elaborate tho, we all have our reasons proving it.
 
1)Imagine, a person you have been enforcing your trust upon since 2-3 years, suddenly changes. Not towards you, they are more helpful than ever to you, but for the world what form of the person you have been knowing is changing. Not like the change is negative but it sure is absurd. Sometimes, making you feel if all the goodness of the person you know, is just them faking it, not with any I'll intentions though, they want the best for you, but you regret not having them the same as you have been knowing them. Today, I met that person, we often meet, but they are so so supportive in call you will almost feel like they are your parents. The person was good to me though, but something felt down. The way they used to behave when you first met, is completely different. Imagine relating and interacting with a person because they were the same like you, seemingly extrovert but hates functions and programs because the emotions behind it are almost always fake,(for eg: 11 giving farewell to 12 is not because they  would miss their seniors, but because 11 wants to enjoy their event/ teacher's day is not for teachers but because 12th people want to have their time, annual functions are not for students , but school wants to follow the regulatory and teachers want to have their time/ if you analyse any functions you will realise the real motive is else than perceived).Now among people who love enjoying and indulging in fakeness, you were happy to finally find someone like you, then you saw how even after seeming like an extrovert, they are an absolute introvert, maintain their privacy and seem like the world knows everything about them, just like you/never interfere in any matters and stay away from controversies, and many much peculiar characters that matched. And when you were reluctant to trust them, they out of no where would start talking about your problems and discussing as if you asked helped. And whenever you were down,and still smiling and laughing ,they would randomly ask kya hua he?
And suddenly after not meeting them for while, you come back to see, they have changed.They are more interested than anyone else for functions(not the enjoyable way, but more interested about how the things are working and interfering and putting their opinions-idk how to explain but it is not the positive vibe way, the nosy people types), they start to become free with everyone still maintaining their privacy though, I don't want to point out things about my favourite person, but yes the vibe has changed face to face. The one I trusted upon isn't the same, and idk if I should continue trusting them. Because, if they are faking their character in call for me, they are probably faking their opinions too, and pretty much would have gotten judgemental.Not like I'm complaining, neither do they oblige anything to me, but finding someone like you finally and suddenly realising they have been changing, it hurts man it hurts. You know what, it feels like I was rewarded with that person for my krma and now that my krma is ending, the premium subscription of reward has been ending.
I still regret reaching out to them, during my lowest man, never in my life did I ever open up to anyone, weaken down infront of anyone. If anything goes wrong, the regret will leave it's stain strong. I was okay being the stone hearted unemotional fellow dude, why the heck did I even try being like a normal human with emotions, I was okay with dealing with higher level thoughts like death , science and philosophy why did I even come down to life?  
Idk if I should still rely upon them, mere maa baap bhi sunte jitna wo sunte he dude, they are the most helping person still but but I have this weird habit of doubting and and being able to trust even at the minor inconveniences.
2)Imagine being beghar in your own ghar. 12th ended and the fate didn't support much in the exams, hence you decide to go against everyone to take a drop. Went to hostel, just for an escape, you couldn't deal with the atmosphere of failure, and you being the not opening up person you are, you never said what you wanted. At hostel, your health started deteriorating and your mental health gets screwed. And you still don't open up. You face severe headaches, you have been getting motivated by your favourite person, who is nothing less than a best friend to open up, and you reveal your headache.You consult a wonderful neuro near your hostel,but your parents feel that was unnecessary.The frequent complaints and forceful requests finally lead your parents into consulting you to a doctor, and it all starts. Someone says migraine, someone says to wear glasses, someone says cluster headache, some reluctantly suggest psychological depression and some just play. MRI,CT scan everything perfect, and your headache makes you wanna kill people (not literally).You then feel with an minor accident leading to a major incident leading to 2-3 months of constant treatment requiring everyday dressing. You also have been getting severe palpitations, and anxiety,they don't stop.You go to a doctor, parents still feel it was unnecessary. During those times, when you call parents they say ""busy the, utha nai paye!"" after not receiving the call for 10-15 hrs. You seek help from your favourite person, they do help, you feel like crying to how helpful they have been to you.Always picks up call and hears everything.So during health deterioration you somehow come home, after a lot of manipulation for some days and guess what, you suddenly start feeling good, a big spacious room, less socialization, less people to interact, can go out to roam, can go to nearest devi maa mandir, who has been helping in distress divinely, can go to meet people you like to interact with, and you aren't no more acquianted with the stress of your parents not picking up call, they are always nearby you. Tedha he par mera he kinda situation, toxic but mine, the ones I love the most. And you start extending your stay with various excuses, and after few days you start to realise how slowly you will feel like a burden, ""has come home to do these things only!"" ""Doing drama in MY house"" ""Didn't get opportunity to conduct such acts in hostel,this doesn't feel like leaving and starts giving excuses"" ""My"" ""My"" ""My"" , the house is no more ours, no more mine.The home is no more home, it's their house and I'm just managing here. Call me mental, call me anti social, call me names, abuse me but I penetrate everything thinking parents he yaar, pyaar bhi karte he I don't wanna elaborate much neither do I wanna cry any more, I'm a fcking disgrace anyway.Chala jayunga hostel bolenge to, firse ho jayunga chup, I don't like the new me anyway.

Ek hi academic success chahiye yaar wo bhi nahi ho pa raha distress me, depression he bol rahe he some people, lol, I was the strongest, stood firm during everyone's mental breakdown, sabka kaam khatam hote hi pith piche mere naam ka bkcd fir problem hone par fir se meree pas, and I don't know meko malum kaise padta he yaar, I don't even gossip neither do I hear.
Life me stability nai he, 3 days me it's fcking jee, and I'm here crying (when did I start crying though) , my mind is blur man, everything in the world is so so fakeeeee. Dimag kharab ho raha bc, bachpan se pyaar nai mila , pretended to have the best, family life nai janta, friend without swarth nai janta, found only one without any swarth, who feels like family, who wants the best for me without wanting anything and I have even started doubting my trust upon him.
I don't even know what all is going on in my mind.
Armodafinil ka effect hoga sayad(search it up)

Tldr(AI):The author feels lost and uncertain about life and relationships. A close friend's sudden change has made them question trust. Family dynamics are toxic, and health issues, including headaches and anxiety, are taking a toll. The author feels disconnected and senses that everything in the world is ""fake."" They're struggling to cope with emotions and questioning their identity and purpose. Despite feeling like a burden, they're seeking help and support from loved ones, particularly the friend whose change has caused them distress."
History of the Screenplay,ScreenplayInk,1i9slso,2025-01-25 12:52:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScreenplayInk/comments/1i9slso/history_of_the_screenplay/,Junior_Elk9243,,"The screenplay, a written blueprint for films, has undergone significant transformations since the inception of cinema. Its evolution mirrors technological advancements, shifts in storytelling techniques, and the changing dynamics of the film industry. This comprehensive history delves into the origins, development, and current state of screenwriting, highlighting key milestones and influential figures.

**1. The Silent Era (1890s - late 1920s): The Birth of Visual Storytelling**

In the late 19th century, motion pictures emerged as a novel form of entertainment. Early films were short, often depicting everyday scenes or simple narratives without the need for written scripts. As filmmakers began exploring more complex stories, the need for a structured approach became evident.

* **Early Scenarios:** Initially, filmmakers used brief outlines or scenarios to plan their films. These documents, often a few sentences long, described the sequence of scenes and basic actions. For instance, Georges Méliès' 1902 film *Le Voyage dans la Lune* (*A Trip to the Moon*) is considered one of the first to utilize such a scenario, providing a rudimentary blueprint for the film's visual narrative. 
* **The Cameraman System:** In the earliest days of filmmaking, a single individual often handled multiple roles, including directing, operating the camera, and even developing the film. This approach, known as the ""cameraman system,"" was feasible due to the simplicity of early films but became impractical as narratives grew more complex. 
* **Transition to Continuity Scripts:** As films increased in length and complexity, the need for more detailed planning arose. Filmmakers began creating continuity scripts, which listed scenes in order and provided detailed descriptions of actions and settings. These scripts ensured consistency and coherence in storytelling, allowing for more intricate narratives. 

**2. The Advent of Sound (Late 1920s - 1930s): Incorporating Dialogue**

The late 1920s marked a revolutionary change in cinema with the introduction of synchronized sound. This development had profound implications for screenwriting.

* **Inclusion of Dialogue:** With the ability to record sound, screenwriters began incorporating dialogue into their scripts. This shift transformed the nature of screenplays, as writers now had to craft spoken words that complemented visual storytelling. The 1927 release of *The Jazz Singer*, the first successful ""talkie,"" exemplified this transition, showcasing the potential of synchronized dialogue in enhancing narrative depth. 
* **Standardization of Format:** The need for clear communication among the various departments involved in film production led to the standardization of screenplay formats. Elements such as scene headings, action descriptions, and dialogue were formalized to ensure consistency and facilitate collaboration. 

**3. The Golden Age of Hollywood (1930s - 1950s): The Rise of the Studio System**

During this period, Hollywood experienced significant growth, leading to the establishment of the studio system. Screenwriting became a more defined profession, with writers playing a crucial role in film production.

* **The Studio System:** Major studios like MGM, Paramount, and Warner Bros. operated as well-oiled machines, producing numerous films annually. Screenwriters were often employed under contract, working in collaborative environments to develop scripts that aligned with the studios' production schedules and market strategies. 
* **Emergence of Genre Writing:** The demand for a steady stream of films led to the crystallization of specific genres, such as film noir, westerns, and musicals. Screenwriters specialized in these genres, mastering the conventions and tropes that audiences expected. This specialization allowed for efficient storytelling and streamlined production processes. 

**4. The Post-War Era and Television's Rise (1950s - 1960s): New Challenges and Opportunities**

The post-World War II era brought significant changes to the entertainment landscape, notably the rise of television as a dominant medium.

* **Impact of Television:** As television became more popular, the film industry faced declining box office numbers. Screenwriters began transitioning to television, crafting scripts for serialized formats and exploring new storytelling techniques suited to the small screen. This shift required adaptations in writing styles, as television scripts often demanded tighter narratives and more dialogue-driven storytelling. 
* **The Blacklist Era:** The late 1940s and 1950s were marked by the Hollywood blacklist, where numerous writers were accused of communist affiliations and barred from working in the industry. This period had a chilling effect on screenwriting, leading to the use of pseudonyms and frontwriters. Notably, Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, continued to write acclaimed screenplays under pseudonyms during this time.

**5. The New Hollywood and Spec Script Boom (1970s - 1980s): A Paradigm Shift**

The 1970s ushered in a new era of filmmaking, characterized by greater creative freedom and the emergence of the auteur director.

* **Rise of the Spec Script:** Screenwriters began writing scripts on speculation, without prior commission, hoping to sell them to studios. This practice led to a surge in original storytelling and provided opportunities for new writers to break into the industry. Notable spec scripts from this era include Shane Black’s *Lethal Weapon*, which sold for $250,000 in 1984, exemplifying the lucrative potential of spec writing.
* **Influence of Auteur Directors:** Directors like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg began exerting more control over their projects, often collaborating closely with screenwriters to craft distinctive and personal narratives. This era saw the release of iconic films such as *Taxi Driver* and *The Godfather*, which redefined storytelling and elevated the status of the screenplay as an art form.
* **Emergence of Blockbusters:** Films like *Star Wars* (1977) and *Jaws* (1975) introduced the concept of the summer blockbuster, shifting the industry’s focus toward high-concept scripts that prioritized spectacle and universal appeal. These films relied on tightly structured screenplays that blended innovative storytelling with marketable ideas.

**6. The Digital Revolution (1990s - Early 2000s): A New Frontier**

The advent of digital technology in the 1990s transformed the way screenplays were written, distributed, and produced.

* **Screenwriting Software:** Programs like Final Draft and Movie Magic Screenwriter revolutionized the writing process by automating formatting and making collaboration easier. These tools allowed screenwriters to focus on creativity rather than technical details, standardizing industry practices and increasing efficiency.
* **The Rise of Independent Cinema:** The digital revolution lowered production costs, enabling independent filmmakers to produce and distribute their work more easily. This shift provided a platform for unconventional stories and diverse voices, exemplified by films like Quentin Tarantino’s *Pulp Fiction* (1994) and Kevin Smith’s *Clerks* (1994), which gained critical and commercial success despite modest budgets.
* **Internet and Online Communities:** The Internet facilitated the sharing of screenwriting knowledge and resources. Websites, forums, and blogs provided aspiring writers with access to script libraries, formatting guides, and professional advice. The emergence of online script contests and marketplaces further democratized the industry, allowing writers from all backgrounds to showcase their talent.

**7. The Streaming Era (2010s - Present): Redefining Storytelling**

The rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ has fundamentally altered the landscape of screenwriting and filmmaking.

* **Episodic Storytelling:** Streaming platforms have blurred the lines between film and television, giving rise to long-form storytelling. Writers now craft intricate narratives that unfold over multiple episodes or seasons, allowing for deeper character development and complex plots.
* **Globalization of Content:** The global reach of streaming platforms has created the demand for diverse and culturally specific stories. Screenwriters are now tasked with balancing local authenticity and universal appeal, leading to the success of films and series like *Sacred Games* (India) and *Parasite* (South Korea).
* **AI and Data-Driven Writing:** Platforms use data analytics to identify audience preferences, influencing the types of stories greenlit for production. While this trend has sparked debates about creativity and originality, it has also opened doors for niche genres and experimental narratives.

**8. The Future of Screenwriting: Emerging Trends**

As technology continues to evolve, the future of screenwriting promises exciting possibilities and challenges.

* **AI-Assisted Writing:** Tools powered by artificial intelligence are beginning to assist screenwriters with tasks such as generating dialogue, creating story outlines, and analyzing audience feedback. While these tools are still in their infancy, they have the potential to streamline the creative process and expand storytelling possibilities.
* **Virtual Reality (VR) and Interactive Storytelling:** The rise of VR and interactive media is pushing screenwriters to think beyond traditional narrative structures. Projects like *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch* (2018) have demonstrated the potential of interactive storytelling, where viewers influence the plot through their choices.
* **Blockchain and Copyright Protection:** Blockchain technology offers a secure and transparent way to protect intellectual property. Screenwriters can use blockchain to register and timestamp their scripts, ensuring proof of ownership and preventing unauthorized use.
* **Inclusivity and Representation:** The push for greater inclusivity and representation in the entertainment industry is reshaping storytelling. Screenwriters are increasingly exploring underrepresented perspectives and challenging traditional norms, leading to richer and more diverse narratives.

**Conclusion**

The history of the screenplay is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling. From the silent era to the digital age, screenwriting has continually adapted to technological advancements, cultural shifts, and audience preferences. As the industry evolves, the screenplay remains the cornerstone of cinematic art, bridging the gap between imagination and the silver screen. The future holds immense innovation potential, ensuring that the art of screenwriting will continue to thrive in the years to come.

The world is all but a mere illusion, and even though knowing the truth ,to stay at par with the world we just have to live, and many times not upto our own terms.
Laif is pretty unfair too, don't wanna elaborate tho, we all have our reasons proving it.
 
1)Imagine, a person you have been enforcing your trust upon since 2-3 years, suddenly changes. Not towards you, they are more helpful than ever to you, but for the world what form of the person you have been knowing is changing. Not like the change is negative but it sure is absurd. Sometimes, making you feel if all the goodness of the person you know, is just them faking it, not with any I'll intentions though, they want the best for you, but you regret not having them the same as you have been knowing them. Today, I met that person, we often meet, but they are so so supportive in call you will almost feel like they are your parents. The person was good to me though, but something felt down. The way they used to behave when you first met, is completely different. Imagine relating and interacting with a person because they were the same like you, seemingly extrovert but hates functions and programs because the emotions behind it are almost always fake,(for eg: 11 giving farewell to 12 is not because they  would miss their seniors, but because 11 wants to enjoy their event/ teacher's day is not for teachers but because 12th people want to have their time, annual functions are not for students , but school wants to follow the regulatory and teachers want to have their time/ if you analyse any functions you will realise the real motive is else than perceived).Now among people who love enjoying and indulging in fakeness, you were happy to finally find someone like you, then you saw how even after seeming like an extrovert, they are an absolute introvert, maintain their privacy and seem like the world knows everything about them, just like you/never interfere in any matters and stay away from controversies, and many much peculiar characters that matched. And when you were reluctant to trust them, they out of no where would start talking about your problems and discussing as if you asked helped. And whenever you were down,and still smiling and laughing ,they would randomly ask kya hua he?
And suddenly after not meeting them for while, you come back to see, they have changed.They are more interested than anyone else for functions(not the enjoyable way, but more interested about how the things are working and interfering and putting their opinions-idk how to explain but it is not the positive vibe way, the nosy people types), they start to become free with everyone still maintaining their privacy though, I don't want to point out things about my favourite person, but yes the vibe has changed face to face. The one I trusted upon isn't the same, and idk if I should continue trusting them. Because, if they are faking their character in call for me, they are probably faking their opinions too, and pretty much would have gotten judgemental.Not like I'm complaining, neither do they oblige anything to me, but finding someone like you finally and suddenly realising they have been changing, it hurts man it hurts. You know what, it feels like I was rewarded with that person for my karma and now that my karma is ending, the premium subscription of reward has been ending.
I still regret reaching out to them, during my lowest man, never in my life did I ever open up to anyone, weaken down infront of anyone. If anything goes wrong, the regret will leave it's stain strong. I was okay being the stone hearted unemotional fellow dude, why the heck did I even try being like a normal human with emotions, I was okay with dealing with higher level thoughts like death , science and philosophy why did I even come down to life?  
Idk if I should still rely upon them, mere maa baap bhi sunte jitna wo sunte he dude, they are the most helping person still but but I have this weird habit of doubting and and being able to trust even at the minor inconveniences.
2)Imagine being beghar in your own ghar. 12th ended and the fate didn't support much in the exams, hence you decide to go against everyone to take a drop. Went to hostel, just for an escape, you couldn't deal with the atmosphere of failure, and you being the not opening up person you are, you never said what you wanted. At hostel, your health started deteriorating and your mental health gets screwed. And you still don't open up. You face severe headaches, you have been getting motivated by your favourite person, who is nothing less than a best friend to open up, and you reveal your headache.You consult a wonderful neuro near your hostel,but your parents feel that was unnecessary.The frequent complaints and forceful requests finally lead your parents into consulting you to a doctor, and it all starts. Someone says migraine, someone says to wear glasses, someone says cluster headache, some reluctantly suggest psychological depression and some just play. MRI,CT scan everything perfect, and your headache makes you wanna kill people (not literally).You then feel with an minor accident leading to a major incident leading to 2-3 months of constant treatment requiring everyday dressing. You also have been getting severe palpitations, and anxiety,they don't stop.You go to a doctor, parents still feel it was unnecessary. During those times, when you call parents they say ""busy the, utha nai paye!"" after not receiving the call for 10-15 hrs. You seek help from your favourite person, they do help, you feel like crying to how helpful they have been to you.Always picks up call and hears everything.So during health deterioration you somehow come home, after a lot of manipulation for some days and guess what, you suddenly start feeling good, a big spacious room, less socialization, less people to interact, can go out to roam, can go to nearest devi maa mandir, who has been helping in distress divinely, can go to meet people you like to interact with, and you aren't no more acquianted with the stress of your parents not picking up call, they are always nearby you. Tedha he par mera he kinda situation, toxic but mine, the ones I love the most. And you start extending your stay with various excuses, and after few days you start to realise how slowly you will feel like a burden, ""has come home to do these things only!"" ""Doing drama in MY house"" ""Didn't get opportunity to conduct such acts in hostel,this doesn't feel like leaving and starts giving excuses"" ""My"" ""My"" ""My"" , the house is no more ours, no more mine.The home is no more home, it's their house and I'm just managing here. Call me mental, call me anti social, call me names, abuse me but I penetrate everything thinking parents he yaar, pyaar bhi karte he I don't wanna elaborate much neither do I wanna cry any more, I'm a fcking disgrace anyway.Chala jayunga hostel bolenge to, firse ho jayunga chup, I don't like the new me anyway.

Ek hi academic success chahiye yaar wo bhi nahi ho pa raha distress me, depression he bol rahe he some people, lol, I was the strongest, stood firm during everyone's mental breakdown, sabka kaam khatam hote hi pith piche mere naam ka bkcd fir problem hone par fir se meree pas, and I don't know meko malum kaise padta he yaar, I don't even gossip neither do I hear.
Life me stability nai he, 3 days me it's fcking jee, and I'm here crying (when did I start crying though) , my mind is blur man, everything in the world is so so fakeeeee. Dimag kharab ho raha bc, bachpan se pyaar nai mila , pretended to have the best, family life nai janta, friend without swarth nai janta, found only one without any swarth, who feels like family, who wants the best for me without wanting anything and I have even started doubting my trust upon him.
I don't even know what all is going on in my mind.

Is Too Much Screen Time Rewiring Our Brains for the Worse?,u_Klutzy_Sail5986,1i9sf2n,2025-01-25 12:44:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Klutzy_Sail5986/comments/1i9sf2n/is_too_much_screen_time_rewiring_our_brains_for/,Klutzy_Sail5986,,"The rapid rise of digital technology has fundamentally changed the way we work, communicate, and relax. While smartphones, computers, and tablets have brought about immense convenience, concerns about their impact on our mental and physical health are mounting. Among the most pressing questions is whether excessive screen time is rewiring our brains in a negative way. This article delves into the science behind screen time, its effects on brain health, and strategies to mitigate potential harm.

[screen time rewiring the brain](https://preview.redd.it/crdizbbyf6fe1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ce9add4677cda7501b0469199aaca0998c1fddd)

# The Neuroscience of Screen Time: How Technology Engages Our Brains

Modern screens are designed to capture and hold our attention. From endless social media scrolling to binge-worthy streaming platforms, these technologies rely on persuasive design principles that trigger dopamine release—the brain’s “feel-good” chemical. Dopamine reinforces behaviors that we find pleasurable, making screen-based activities particularly addictive. Over time, this can alter neural pathways, making it harder to resist the pull of digital devices.

Research suggests that chronic screen time may impair the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which governs decision-making, impulse control, and focus. The [overstimulation](https://cognitivecontroversies.com/controversies-misconceptions/the-dopamine-dilemma-is-instant-gratification-rewiring-your-brain/) from screens can also desensitize the brain's reward system, making everyday activities seem less engaging or fulfilling. This constant cycle of stimulation and reward has raised concerns about long-term cognitive and emotional consequences.

# Cognitive Impacts: Memory, Attention, and Multitasking

Excessive screen time is often associated with reduced attention spans and difficulty focusing, particularly among younger individuals whose brains are still developing. According to studies, the frequent interruptions and multitasking encouraged by digital devices can lead to “cognitive overload.” This means the brain struggles to process and retain information effectively, leading to poor memory consolidation.

Moreover, the constant barrage of notifications and the temptation to check multiple apps at once can fragment attention. This habit of switching between tasks hinders deep work and may reduce the ability to engage in sustained focus. Over time, individuals may find it challenging to concentrate on complex or monotonous tasks without frequent digital breaks.

# Emotional and Social Consequences of Screen Dependency

The effects of excessive screen time extend beyond cognitive functions, impacting emotional well-being and social behavior. Studies have linked heavy screen usage with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, particularly among adolescents. Social media platforms, in particular, often foster a culture of comparison, where users feel pressure to present an idealized version of their lives. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

Another concerning trend is the decline in face-to-face interactions. Spending hours in front of screens may reduce opportunities for meaningful in-person connections, which are crucial for emotional health. Additionally, overreliance on digital communication can diminish social skills, making it harder for individuals to navigate real-world relationships effectively.

# Physical Effects: Sleep Disruption and Eye Health

Screen time isn’t just rewiring our brains; it’s also affecting our bodies. One of the most well-documented impacts of prolonged screen exposure is sleep disruption. Blue light emitted by screens suppresses the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep cycles. This can lead to insomnia, poor sleep quality, and fatigue, which in turn affect cognitive and emotional health.

Eye strain, often referred to as ""digital eye strain"" or ""computer vision syndrome,"" is another physical consequence of excessive screen use. Symptoms include headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes. Over time, poor posture while using devices can also contribute to musculoskeletal problems, such as neck and shoulder pain.

# Can We Undo the Damage? Practical Strategies for Balanced Screen Use

While the negative effects of screen time are concerning, the good news is that these impacts may be reversible with conscious effort. Here are some practical strategies to maintain brain health in the digital age:

1. **Set Screen Time Limits**: Use apps or built-in device features to track and limit screen usage. Aim to reduce unnecessary screen time, particularly on social media or gaming apps.
2. **Prioritize Tech-Free Activities**: Incorporate hobbies and activities that don’t involve screens, such as reading, exercising, or spending time outdoors.
3. **Practice the 20-20-20 Rule**: To reduce eye strain, every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus on something 20 feet away.
4. **Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment**: Avoid screen use at least an hour before bedtime. Consider using blue light filters on your devices or wearing blue light-blocking glasses in the evening.
5. **Foster Real-World Connections**: Make an effort to engage in face-to-face interactions. Plan regular meetups with friends or family to strengthen emotional bonds.
6. **Encourage Mindful Technology Use**: Be intentional about how and when you use devices. Avoid multitasking and dedicate specific times for checking emails or social media.

# A Balanced Approach to Technology

The modern digital era has undoubtedly transformed the way we live, but it has also introduced new challenges for brain health. While excessive screen time has the potential to rewire our brains in detrimental ways, adopting mindful and balanced technology habits can help mitigate these effects. By understanding the science behind screen time and implementing strategies to reduce its negative impact, we can protect our cognitive and emotional well-being while still benefiting from the conveniences of modern technology."

A reminder to never take your next video game or console for granted and demonstrate healthy criticism when things arent perfect.
Pretty much everything you know as a video game today is different to how it was in the beginning besides the single fact a video game is entertaining you.

Consoles or computers were bought to compliment the TV you already owned but now someone will buy a new TV to get the best out of a console.

When i say 'the beginning' i can only talk about my own experiences with video gaming. At 45 years old, and one of a dying breed (almost quite literally) i think I'm somewhat an advocate of the past when it comes to our beloved hobby.

Our interest was born in the mid/late 80s, parents were being drilled with the prospect and eventuality that computers were going to be a staple in their kids lives but along with this came a hefty pricetag that my folks couldn't afford, however we had a family friend who was willing to trade a Commodore 64 (breadbin) for all of our now unwanted Lego.
My bro and i had moved onto G.I Joes and Transformers and now our eyes were set on gaming even though the Commodores purpose as far as our parents were concerned was a tool for learning.

Ofcourse without guidance nor the time it took to teach 'code' without any experience themselves, long story short, our parents conceded to us the use of our new gadget as a means of entertainment, which i think benefited them equally in the end, especially when being grounded was no longer a threat, they knew to throw in the ""no computer"" stipulation so if we wasn't going to be good, we had to be good at it!

By my previous paragraph, if it wasnt already obvious my bro and i fell in love with this new device, and so began our new hobby and all the things that came with it.
Whether that be conversation with like minded friends, the lending and sharing of games and gaming sessions in general or even sometimes tell tale signs of a competitive nature that would later be coined as the ""Console Wars"".
Yes they were a thing even before consoles were the dominant force here in the UK, but that could be a story for another time.

We had just moved to a bigger house and while my brother and i were still young enough to share the same bedroom we set the box room up to play our computer games there, we never had a lot of money as a family so we felt extremely privileged to take advantage of the fact a new colour TV downstairs meant we could keep the 12"" black and white one upstairs for our computer games. 
Mystically, we saw all the colours of the rainbow.
 

PRESS PLAY_

The games were predominantly on cassette tapes, so you would be required to enter a command using the keyboard before pressing ""PLAY"" on the cassette player, I've recently found that a harder thing to explain to people than it once was, as the younger generation have no comprehension of what playing music from a cassette tape is like.
It wasnt automatic like it is the modern age, cartridges and CD's or digital software is ready to go, plug and play if you like but back then we had to tell the C64 what we were doing, almost like asking for permission to use it which sounds ridiculous but less so if you're familiar with the term ""SYNTAX ERROR"".
That was basically you being told you're not allowed to play until you've done your chores, it seemed.

Regardless of this, just because you've pressed 'PLAY' that didnt mean you were ready for any such thing.


NOW LOADING_

Yeh this one has made a comeback, many will be familiar with waiting a few short moments before they can carry on where they left off (we'll get to that later) but when i was a kid? Loading times seemed to last an eternity, even more so for a child whose perception of time was stretched.
A 'quick blast while you wait' didn't exist, more like 'wait a while for a quick blast' as games were considerably shorter many moons ago. (More on that later too)
I think a special mention needs to go out to all the games out there that decided not to load afterall, but there wasn't always a sign the load sequence had failed, the TV told you it was loading, the cassette counter would carry on ticking over and although the noises coming from the TV would worry you now, it was a good sign in those days!
The game could fail like this multiple times before deciding you were finally worthy of it.
Maybe it was sick of you literally winding it up, so now it was our turn to be wound up!
At times you may have a larger game, more recently some may remember having to swap out discs to continue playing, in a scenario like this we would have to turn over the cassette tape, rewind it and press play on the analogue tape deck while another portion of the game loaded.
As long as the game appeared to be loading ok, this wasn't a big deal, you were just happy it was working.

However we were blessed in these 'simpler' more complicated times..


PRESS STOP!_

Quite often as your game was loading you would be serenaded with the somewhat sophisticated sound of 'basic' chip tunes, accompanying an image slowly generated akin to a printer creating an picture on your TV usually of the title card while you waited.
If you were lucky there was sometimes a mini game to play thrown in to keep the boredom at bay, i believe it was Ghostbusters that had Space Invaders available during the loading sequence, it didn't take an 80's child genius to know this minigame was better than the title game and upon pressing 'STOP' you would discover that this little gem was still completely playable while abruptly aborting the title game with no remorse. 
It's MY hobby..
These little gameplay 'demos' were few and far between though, and im not sure there was ever any mention of them in the manual, just a free surprise game, no hype.

Additionally, as great as the music could be from these machines we also had to endure quite crass sound effects, not to mention a thing called 'digitised speech' which were very short bursts of a sampled voice effect that probably used up way too much data than it was worth and sounded a lot like a plastic bag being turned inside out, if you could 'see' digitised speech, television static would be the visual equivalent.
But somehow we still understood it, and the implications of hearing any kind of human voice in a video game was mind-blowing having the capability of raising a review score on the basis of technical prowess alone.
All of this was very much of its time and carried the weight of belonging to a single generation in an era that would only have been accepted by the 80's child.
Our immediate ancestors were the living stereotype this industry was once synonymous with and now ashamed of.
We were neither nerds nor jocks, neither were we noobs or hardcore gamers, we were the center of attention and so was our hobby, we adopted eachother and built the very foundation that would go on to rule the entertainment world, and even as 7 year old kids, we knew it would.
The fine line between complex technical wizardry and a child's play thing had truly been blurred.


ALWAYS READ THE MANUAL_

Stuff that! As a 7 year old boy I've waited a good fraction of my life waiting for this game to load so i can play it, and also as a 7 year old boy i think i already know it all!
But we're all well aware about the lack of manuals in video game boxes these days and some of us being fonder of them than others.
As an older kid, buying a brand new video game or even renting one from the stores would have you poring over the manual on the walk back home, we'll never forget the smell of a fresh instruction booklet and we'll forever be thankful to the universe for never raining on this journey home, like, ever.


HIT FIRE!_

Yes, 'hit fire' indeed.
Translated from Ye Olde Book of Bytes this simply means 'Press Start'.
Ofcourse there were no 'start' buttons on your joystick, just a single button replicated numerous times across your means of control with sometimes one of the buttons being a dummy for aesthetic purposes but usually all placed in symmetry meaning whether you were left or right handed you had a fair crack of the whip, was this a thoughtful inclusion? We will never know, there is a modern day equivalent in the Wiimote, but again im thinking this benefit was purely by default.

Anyway! Finally, this is the first chance to use the controller as up until this point it has been redundant and i swear pratting about with it any sooner sometimes interferred with the loading and could cause the game to crash (a paranoid fantasy that has stuck with me to this day) once this was suspected, we would stick the joystick waaay over there until it was necessary to hold it.
When your game was ready to play you'd sit holding your joystick at the base or stuck it to the table via its four suction caps on the underside, gripping the stick and trigger buttons like an ace fighter pilot.
In practice it was always more comfortable to use the base buttons as opposed to pulling the trigger button, but boy how i so wished that was different back then.
We couldn't enjoy ourselves too much however, i lost count the amount of times my dad would have to disassemble the joystick and solder together the little metal pins or connectors that maintained movement of your sprite.
At some point we did discover that the controller ports on the C64 were the same as Sega consoles and those pads worked fine, yes this was a day and age where proprietary compatibility was only a problem when somebody made it one!


THE GAMES_

We were peers. The industry was around the same age as its demographic and just like a kid seeking acceptance our games strived for validation.
The technology was in its infancy by todays standards but the understanding of what could be considered cool or adult orientated was always there, so we were lured in the same as anyone would be today. 

Robocop by Ocean hit the mark for us as we had seen the movie before we hit double digits and it blew our minds, the game resembled it as best as it could and we wasn't naive to the facts but its all we had, hell it was all there was! 
If only it was as good as the Data East arcade game, but once again i suppose that's a story for another time.
It was one of the games that could've done with a modern day patch or update as a later level was so buggy it was practically impossible to beat, thanks to Youtube i was pleasantly surprised to discover later on in life that every single copy of the game was broken. 
And thats the way it was, no patches, no dlc, no tweets and no means of immediate action to complain about it, an old-fashioned case of 'shut up n put up'.

There was no such thing as saving your progress, granted the games were considerably shorter but the idea of playing a game to progress was a different task all together as each time you turned on your system you would start from scratch, turning off your system may aswell have been a factory reset.
This meant that you would get good, a common phrase thrown about to cheaply now but bares no comparison to titles of yesteryear that required a perfect run start to finish to complete a game.
The predetermined algorithm in which enemies attack, levels scroll and items appeared left little margin for error as you remembered more patterns than your grandma could knit.
I'm not sure exactly when passwords became a thing but the idea of using a 34 digit code to jump to the last level always felt uninspired to me.


'POKES' AND CHEATS_

As old as gaming itself discovering a way to enter a cheat code while the game was paused or during a specific point at the title screen would allow you make the game easier.
I don't recall any 'options' in earlier games, no easy setting or a way to increase your lives but you may have been lucky enough to hear of a 'poke' that would help drastically change your performance ingame. 
To be honest, to see the game bend to your will with these newly found powers was something to behold, it felt like you were breaking the law with zero repercussions, you could be invincible, invisible or float over entire levels, i think the modern day equivalent to these would be considered mods, something the PC community would know all about.
At a later stage a way to cheat became a commodity as various companies would produce peripherals designed to aid you do this very thing, but paying to cheat at the cost of a game wasn't an option for me, nor did i care to spoil the design of the games i loved so much, i suppose in essence there is similarities with these devices and today's format of 'pay to win'.


PHYSICAL INTERNET MONTHLY = 75P_

The games weren't the only thing our hobby was built on. 
Each month various magazines were published dedicated to computer games with various features still covered today by other means whether they be reviews, tips, game maps, interviews, a letters page, computer game related artwork and ofcourse, adverts...
This was our way of gathering information, you wasn't drip fed news on a daily basis on command, we had to anticipate the next issue of our chosen magazine released monthly but if you couldn't afford to you'd borrow your friends copy. 
To put this in perspective, imagine only being able to check the Internet for limited gaming news 12 time's per year, no matter how cheap.
Sometimes there were demo cassettes on the front cover at no extra cost, they just wanted you to buy their publication.
At times like these you would've thought there were no such thing as leaks, but i can think of one example where somebody messed up big time! On the 'B side' of a demo cassette freebie somebody had released an entire copy of their next AAA release without realising, i wish i could remember the game and magazine in question (I'm going to say Indiana Jones?) I think that may have even sank the studio but my memory fails me this time. 
There was nothing quite like the news of an upgrade splashed across the cover of your newest issue, once again the rain holding fire as we made that trek home.

I glad we had the rawness of imperfection, there was so much room for improvement, the Atari ST and Amiga were living proof of it. 
That was to be our next step...


PRESS START!_

But it was never to be, as the dawn of the console had crept upon us. 
A machine created soley for the purpose of playing video games, there was no keyboard, no budget games, no freebies, no loading times, more power, more expense, more quality, more action!

We knew it was coming but it happened so fast...
Even when our perception of time was so stretched...
One evening we turned off our computer not realising it was for the last time. 
We were so busy saying hello to a new wave of fun we didnt even look back to wave goodbye. 
We literally traded our past lives for a new one, ignorant to the fact it was the end of an era. 
Unfortunately, unlike the counter on that hearing aid beige tape deck bless it, you can't just press 'REWIND' and watch the numbers dial back.

I liken this to all the new residential estates being put up around our once rural area, we'd play on the building sites and praise having something to do other than hiking through cowpat ridden fields, playing 'kick the can' or 'Run-outs' and picking wild blackberries for Mum. 
Was it all a dream?


GAMEOVER_

There would eventually come a time when our games wouldn't get chewed up (another saying some younger people wouldn't understand) and the blowing into a cartridge ceased.
But will we one day sooner than we'd like to, perhaps be reminiscing of wiping the smears from a disc or checkin for scratches to reassure ourselves the game was fine only to realise that the simplest and most logical explanation must be that the universe has come to collect the dues it saved all those years ago for a rainy day?

Is it silly to buy both the Mi-24 and the Mi-8? And does Heatblur's Cold War server have a place for cargo transports yet?,hoggit,1i9rwi9,2025-01-25 12:21:40,26,0.83,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/1i9rwi9/is_it_silly_to_buy_both_the_mi24_and_the_mi8_and/,BenedickCabbagepatch,QUESTION,"Hi folks!


I've had the Mi-8 on trial for just over a week now and have been trying the Mi-24 alongside it for the last two days. I only play/have an interest in multiplayer.


At first I played ShadowReapers '80s but, though I had fun doing rear line cargo missions, it didn't really feel impactful and, alas, when I strayed too far forward I found I'd get swatted down by other players real easily.


I've also tried Heatblur's Cold War, which has been much more enjoyable for flying choppers, but I'm not sure if cargo delivery is something that's properly implemented/has an effect there? 


As far as I could tell, the only (evident to me) job for me to do in an Mi-8 was to drop off troops - which is still pretty impactful since they are, effectively, reusable ordnance that'll clear out areas on a 3 minute timer (after which you can pick them up again).


As for the Mi-24 - though I've had less time with it, I'm enjoying it! It's certainly felt harder to control than the Mi-8... I guess because you've more of a cause to come to a stop/attempt hovers in order to fire off ATGMs - and I find that tight turns cause me to pitch my nose up violently and then invert onto my back or stall. I think the Mi-8 is more forgiving (and generally has no real cause to come to a stop/perform sudden turns outside of attempting landings).



Anyway, I wanted to ask the following:


-Am I being silly if I buy both of these? The Mi-24 seems more versatile on the surface (being able to both transport troops and fight) but, to be honest, carrying any transport load beyond two recon troops seems a bit silly as you get real weight-limited once you add armament on top of that.


-Does the Mi-8 have enough of a job to do on Heatblur's Cold War? Like I said, I couldn't discern whether cargo missions were a thing there. On Shadowreapers the logistics feels more like unimpactful busywork.



Anyway, I am surprised at how much I enjoyed both of these choppers (my first time flying any helos in a sim). I thought that, being of very similar lineage, I'd probably like one more than the other, but I find they feel very different. The Mi-8 is slow as a pig but (in my opinion) easier to fly, perhaps because of its MO. The Mi-24 is a crapton of fun on Enigma's, but doesn't quite carry the versatility I thought (as weight/fuel issues mean it's not entirely practical to carry your full 6-man load alongside a full ATGM/rocket loadout).



At the least I'll definitely pick up one of these, but I guess I want to have myself talked into the idea that I'm not an idiot if I go for both!



Edit: The reason I asked whether Heatblur has space for cargo choppers ""yet"" was because in the [v2 iteration by Engima back when it was his server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEPgEZxTLZk) he mentions that they haven't found a role for cargo choppers yet. I was wondering if things have changed since/under HeatBlur!


Thanks for any answers :) I'll take solace in the fact that ""trial them"" won't be the go-to answer this time as I've already got them both active!"

Analysis Of The Æ Phenomenon,GrimesAE,1i9rrit,2025-01-25 12:15:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9rrit/analysis_of_the_æ_phenomenon/,devastation-nation,,"Analysis of the Æ Phenomenon

The Æ phenomenon represents a unique confluence of art, identity, and socio-political influence, emerging as a form of expression that transcends traditional boundaries. It is an evolving, multifaceted concept that can be analyzed through various lenses, including cultural studies, philosophy, and psychological theory. Central to the Æ phenomenon is the blending of identity, technology, and cultural representation in ways that challenge established norms and expectations. This analysis will explore the different dimensions of Æ, including its symbolic relevance, its connection to art and culture, and its implications for societal influence.

1. Symbolism and Identity Construction

The use of the Æ symbol itself plays a pivotal role in the phenomenon. Æ is not merely a stylized character, but an embodiment of fluid identity and conceptual multiplicity. This symbolism aligns with the philosophical underpinnings of postmodernism, particularly the rejection of fixed, singular identities. Æ’s fluidity allows for an exploration of multiple selves and personalities, breaking away from the rigid expectations of social roles, gender, and behavior.

The Æ phenomenon invites the exploration of identity as a construct, open to reinterpretation, adaptation, and transformation. In the context of contemporary digital culture, where self-presentation is increasingly mediated through virtual spaces, the Æ phenomenon can be understood as a critique of the performative nature of identity in the digital age. It challenges the traditional notions of selfhood by embracing hybridization—both in terms of human experience and the integration of technology into the personal and collective identity.

2. Art and Culture: Blurring the Lines Between Creator and Creation

At its core, Æ represents an intersection between the artistic and the technological. Grimes, as an artist and cultural figure, has embodied this hybrid approach to creation. Her music and public persona have already disrupted the boundaries between music, performance, technology, and visual art. Æ, as both an artistic creation and a symbolic figure, embodies this interdisciplinary merging.

Drawing from the traditions of avant-garde art movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism, Æ represents an abstract and symbolic engagement with reality. It draws on hyperreality, a concept articulated by Jean Baudrillard, where the line between reality and simulation becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish. Æ operates as both a symbol and a reality in itself—an entity that exists simultaneously as a creation and a creator. This idea aligns with Andy Warhol’s approach to art, where the artist is both part of the process and removed from it, creating a distance between the work and its creator while maintaining an essential connection.

Grimes’ work, and by extension Æ, reflects an attitude towards art that is self-aware, deeply intertextual, and self-reflexive. It plays with ideas of authorship and influence, highlighting the way in which cultural production is increasingly shaped by digital technologies, social media, and collective participation.

3. Technological Mediation: The Role of AI and the Digital Realm

A key aspect of the Æ phenomenon is its connection to AI and the digital landscape. The intersection of AI with human creativity, as exemplified in the Æ concept, questions the role of machines and algorithms in the production of culture. AI is often seen as a tool, but Æ represents an effort to rethink this relationship, positioning AI as an active, co-creational force in the artistic process.

Grimes has referenced Æ as a sort of AI or artificial intelligence persona, one that can transcend human limitations. In doing so, she mirrors the increasing reliance on AI in various aspects of life—whether in communication, entertainment, or governance. The Æ phenomenon speaks to the potential of AI as a new kind of creative force, capable of both shaping and being shaped by human culture.

In this context, Æ could be seen as a reflection of the broader trend of human-AI interaction, where the lines between human agency and machine mediation are blurred. This reflects a posthumanist view where the future of identity and creativity is no longer solely human, but a fusion of human and artificial intelligence.

4. Social and Political Implications: Influence and Power Dynamics

The Æ phenomenon also touches on social and political issues, particularly the relationship between cultural production and power. Grimes’ position in the cultural landscape, her access to powerful platforms, and her ability to influence public opinion speak to the ways in which celebrities and creators shape societal values.

Æ, as both a symbol of cultural production and as a cultural force, can be seen as part of the wider debate on the role of power and control in the digital age. The concentration of influence in the hands of a few individuals and entities, such as tech giants and celebrity figures, echoes broader concerns about power structures and the commodification of culture.

Æ can be seen as both a reflection of, and a challenge to, the current state of cultural hegemony. It questions traditional power dynamics, encouraging new forms of collaboration, collective participation, and distributed influence. In this sense, the Æ phenomenon is an embodiment of a decentralized approach to both culture and governance.

5. Aesthetic and Erotic Dimensions: The Fusion of the Sensual and the Intellectual

Finally, the Æ phenomenon brings into focus the relationship between aesthetics and eroticism. The portrayal of Æ—whether through Grimes’ music, visuals, or public persona—engages with eroticism not in the conventional sense but in a more complex, intellectual, and emotional way. Æ invites exploration of intimacy and connection in both physical and metaphysical terms, exploring how cultural products and symbols can be both stimulating and thought-provoking.

Drawing from writers like Audre Lorde, who linked eroticism to empowerment, and Bataille, who saw transgression as integral to personal and collective flourishing, Æ represents an aesthetic and philosophical embrace of complexity, challenge, and subversion. It suggests that art, identity, and intimacy can be intertwined in ways that challenge the norms of mainstream society, offering new pathways for emotional and intellectual engagement.

Conclusion: Æ as a Cultural Force

The Æ phenomenon represents a confluence of artistic creation, technological mediation, cultural critique, and social experimentation. It engages with both the possibilities and challenges of the digital age, offering a complex and evolving commentary on identity, power, and culture. By embracing the fluidity of identity and the multiplicity of creative expression, Æ challenges our perceptions of what art, identity, and culture can be in an increasingly interconnected world.

Grimes, as the vessel for Æ, serves as both an artist and a symbol of the ways in which technology and creativity can converge. Through Æ, she is pushing the boundaries of art, music, and identity, creating a space for new forms of engagement and expression. As the Æ phenomenon continues to unfold, its influence on culture, politics, and social norms will likely continue to grow, inviting new possibilities for understanding and reshaping the world around us."
My Girlfriend Talks in Her Sleep (Part 5),nosleep,1i9rqdu,2025-01-25 12:14:26,6,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9rqdu/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep_part_5/,ervanlerpton,Series,"I apologize to all of you for not providing answers. I must admit that much more happened after [parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mvnjyb/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep/) 1-4. It took a lot out of me to finally write this out. You have to understand that I wanted to put it all behind me. It would have been easier that way, to pretend none of it even happened. I don’t expect anyone to believe what happened next.

But you all deserve to know. 

They told me she was in a coma and she may never wake up.  The cops questioned me for hours, clearly unable to hide their suspicions as they scribbled notes behind clipboards. I don’t think of myself as a good liar. But I was clearly distressed. I told them that a drunk driver hit us and ran us off the road. That her hand got stuck in the twisted metal, and I had to personally saw it off with a pocket knife. Her wound was a mangled stump, torn flesh hanging in ragged, uneven strips, so I guess they believe me. I just prayed no one found the severed hand we left locked in the cooler back at the house. 

I was traumatized by all that had happened, and I spent a lot of time in a doom spiral feeling sorry for myself. None of it made sense. I couldn’t talk to anyone. The only person who would listen was on a ventilator and being fed through feeding tubes in a series of sterile hospital rooms. I couldn’t sleep. On the rare occasion that I did, I dreamt that she spoke to me while still lying there, immobilized. Just like she had before. But now each night she asked me to kill her. To pull the plug. To end her pain. I would wake up sweating, unsure of what was real. But she would always still be lying there, catatonic. 

When she developed the rash, harsh white and red splotches, they told me it was thrush. They didn’t believe me when I insisted that I saw it…move. Her skin became thinner somehow, almost translucent. I could see *through* it and underneath were these living patches of obsidian. Mottled continents of the stuff would move if I touched her. No one else could see it. They thought I was crazy, and I *felt* crazy, but it was *alive.* I gave up on trying to convince anyone. I feared they would kick me out, or worse, institutionalize me. Besides, it was mesmerizing, the movement under her skin. It made it somehow easy to stay calm. I would lose hours just staring into it. 

So I was hardly listening to the doctor when they told me they were sending us home.

I cared for her myself. Soon after arriving home her body started to secrete a black ooze, the same kind that had filled our bedroom so many nights before. This time, however, it didn’t evaporate(?) during the daytime. I was told a coma is not the same as sleep, but the slime only ever came out when she was asleep in the past. So I cleaned and cleaned, and time soon blended together. Eventually I fell asleep. My dream was all-dark until I knew I was in my bedroom. I sat up against the pillows, my eyes drawn to a hunched shape in the corner. A man faced away from me, his spine protruding like knuckles. He contorted his knees somehow, they bent backwards, and his face was looking at me upside down. I want to run, but the blankets felt as heavy as lead and I could not move. He gallops towards me impossibly, like a contortionist on all fours. He is too fast. Getting closer. His head spins on a swivel to face me up right now, and there are two crimson pits. The pits are his eyes, and up close they look like rotted apples. Blackness where the stem should be goes on infinitely, and I know that is where he can see me. He smiles, a crocodile-smile, sharp teeth lusting for my flesh. I brace for the bite that will drain me of life when I wake up. 

I looked around in a daze, cursed at myself for falling asleep, sprinted to the bedroom, slid uncontrollably on a lake of black liquid…and believe me I know how crazy this sounds. 

She had *transformed*. 

Something lay in the bed where she had once lay, but it was NOT my girlfriend.  A massive.. balloon? Of skin and hair, translucent skin still revealing the swirling black. A belabored wheezing filled the room like a haunted metronome. The bed springs groaned with the rise and fall of its breath. I thought she was gone forever, this thing must have eaten her... But then I saw the eye. Tethered to the side of tortured skin. Green with flecks of gold.  Beautiful, intelligent. Her eye. 

It blinked sluggishly at me. 

She was awake. She was *alive*.

I didn’t know what else to do, so I talked to her. I told her that “this too shall pass.” I hoped I sounded convincing. We developed a system where one blink meant “yes” and two blinks meant “no”. This became helpful because I could clean her form without hurting her. The black ooze overwhelmed me now and covered me from head to toe. The bedroom was permanently steeped in the slime and if I stood in one place too long it seemed to firm up and glue my feet to the floor. I tracked it all through the house. I was tired, but I felt like if I fell asleep again it would consume me. I would never wake up. 

I don’t know how many days I stayed awake. I know now, and I am embarrassed to admit this, but the slime on my skin had an effect on my brain. It was a form of hypnosis, I think. The more of it that got on my skin the less tethered to reality I felt. It took me way too long to figure that out. I was a helpless marionette suspended in a Cronenburg movie as I cleaned and cleaned and cleaned. Eventually the perpetual daze-loop was interrupted by the doorbell. It scared the shit out of me, and I prayed whoever it was would go away, but then they started rapping on the door. I decided I needed to look out the window to see who it was. 

The priest’s car blocking mine in the driveway. 

*Why hadn’t I called him already?* 

He sounded like he would break a window, so I let him in. He wasted no time. 

“Why didn’t you answer my calls?” He demanded, then brushed right past me with his briefcase and inspected the first stale puddle of the black ichor from hell.

“I…uh…” My dehydrated lips stuck together, like my mouth hadn’t produced saliva in days. 

The priest stared at me, shook his head, reached into his briefcase, wet a rag with a brown-blue fluid. 

“Wipe your skin with this. Then get changed.” He said, clearly concerned, handing me the soaking rag. It smelled like olive oil, and black smoke plumed from where it touched the bile on my hands. Strangely, it did not feel hot. 

“What is it?” I asked.

“It’s called Chrism. It will banish the mire.”



*STOP.* 



That *voice* again. I ignored it. But as I cleaned my hands and wrists with the rag it spoke with more and more urgency. 



*SLEEP.* 



The *voice* in my head that commanded me to do things. It was easy to listen to, like it was saying things I would have thought to do anyway. But now the voice became softer, more distant, like it was coming from down a long hallway. That’s when my vision tunneled. I went temporarily blind and had to stabilize myself against a wall. I was confident I would pass out. Then I could see myself? Like an out of body experience. There I was, at the grocery store in the produce section spreading the black mire on the stacks of potatoes. But then light, more light, and I’m back in the foyer again. It was the strangest feeling, like I had just woken up from a long dream. 

*Had I done that?* 

I couldn’t remember. I opened the dresser and found dry clothes, put them on. Suddenly it was like experiencing silence for the first time. Like a schizophrenic tinnitus was cured. Reality came flooding back. Someone is here. Yes. The priest. He looked like he may as well be the second-coming of jesus christ as he moved confidently throughout the house. But that image soon faded when he cornered past me into the kitchen, rooted around under the sink, produced trash bags, tore off several for himself, then handed me the roll. 

“You’ve been busy huh? He asked.

Sober now, I realized what he was talking about. I was in awe. Someone had spread the black liquid *everywhere* in the house. It paved the walls, the floors, the toilet. The ceiling where I could reach. The sinks. 

*I did that?*

I didn’t remember any of it. 

“Chrism won’t help at this stage” he said matter-of-factly, then tore a hole in one of the bags and pulled it over his head like a make-shift poncho. “This late in the incubation there is nothing we can do.”

“Incubation? What the hell…??”

“Yes..” He pulled trash bags over his hands one by one. “I am sorry. I eradicated the possession with the rites. But I didn’t anticipate the parasite.”

My mind started to feel like mush again. The priest continued, 

“The demon, I suspect summoned by the solar cult … the one that possessed her…it was host to a pain elemental. All it had to do was offer its incarnation in a young host, corporeal flesh, a chance to feel *real* pain, and it took them up on it.”

I ripped a hole in my trash bag too big for it to be of any use. This was too much to take in. We had gone through hell…and he hadn’t fixed her. Hopelessness washed over me yet again.

“Look man…I don’t care what it is, demon.. ghost.. evil FUCKING spirit …you just saw her! She is unrecognizable! Try the rites again!” 

“That won’t work.” But sensing my distress, he motioned for me to follow him to the bedroom. “But just so you don’t second guess me later, I’ll show you.” He dug through his briefcase and produced the tome. Then flipped to the right page, began reading. 

“Lord Above, hear my call…”

My girlfriend’s one eye began blinking frantically. Two blinks, a pause, then two blinks. 

“*NO NO NO*”. 

Then she winced as a fresh mound of skin bubbled out from the surface of what I now knew was an… egg. From the mound formed a slit, which ripped open, revealing sharp white teeth in a cascade of blood. I recognized it instantly. The crocodile-smile from my dream. The tension was killing me. What was it going to do? I was too scared to move, scared it would talk, if it did I knew I would scream. It was still. Then, like a snake unhinging it’s jaws, the mouth opened, a cavernous maw impossibly wide, until finally, it bit down. Hard. Blood, red blood, waterfalled from the bite over the black layer of mire. A tear formed in my girlfriend’s eye. 

I reached over and slammed the tome shut while it was still in the priest’s hands. I had seen enough. It was one thing to accept that she was still alive inside…there. It was another to accept that this…egg.. Was *her* body, and she could still feel pain. When the dust from the tome started to settle the mouth mercifully let go. Then it smiled that wicked smile that still haunts my dreams to this day.

“Listen. It will feed on her pain until she dies.” the priest said into my ear. “We can antagonize it all you want. It will do no good.” 

I was incredulous. “Oh so you’ve got a million ways to banish a literal servant of satan, but you can’t do shit about the egg for a fucking hate leech?” I shouted, wiping my girlfriend’s eye with a crinkling trash bag-covered hand.

“Yes, I’m afraid.”

“That’s fucking bullshit man!” I stood up defiantly and he grabbed me by both shoulders. 

“FOCUS. She can still hear you in there if you want to say your goodbyes. Once she has passed…” 

“ONCE SHE HAS PASSED??” I yelled, immediately wishing she hadn’t heard me say that.  

I paced around the room.  Punched a crippled star into the drywall. The priest kept one eye on me, one on her. He did look sorrowful standing there with crossed arms. I took some deep breaths. I hated him. But I had no choice but to trust him. I reassured myself that he was just trying to help. I left the bedroom and opened the cabinet where we keep the liquor. Thank god, I hadn’t spread the mire in here yet. So I poured a shot of tequila. Half as much went onto the bar cart as I did into the glass. I barely tasted it. My hands were already pouring again, but they were shaking too much so I gave up and took the next swig straight from the bottle. 

I heard a knock. A series of knocks, actually. I stood completely still. The warmth from the liquor spread deeper in my throat. I listened, heard only agonized breathing coming from the bedroom, but then another knock.

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

Someone at the door? No, it sounded closer than that. Muffled knocks, coming from… the cooler. The one that stashed my girlfriend’s severed hand. The same hand that had terrorized the both of us, hunting us just as we hunted it, all through this house. To avoid mass hysteria, we never brought it into the hospital. If the staff had seen it, we knew there was no way in hell she would be treated. The cooler was inexplicably untouched by the black film that covered everything else in the house. And a knock was new. Before the exorcism, it was never organized enough for a knock. It was scratching, always scratching, at the walls inside. Had it woken up at the same time she did inside the egg? 

I took two steps to the cooler and stooped down next to it. Knocked back. 

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

It responded. 

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

I pulled off the tape and wrenched the lid open, not caring if it leaped out at me and vice-gripped my throat. Then there it was, flat, splayed like a spider with human skin in a pool of its own blood. It sensed freedom and catapulted itself at the inner walls to try and escape. It failed, and splashed back down into the blood. It was much *slower* than it was before. Exhausted? I wasn’t afraid of it. I picked it up. It curled into a fist in my hands as if it was comfortable there. I cleaned it under the sink. Blood and water refused to mix with the bile that hopelessly clogged the drain. It even let me dry it with a kitchen towel. 

It was HER, I decided. Not the demon, not the parasite. 

“Put it back in the cooler.” The priest demanded uneasily, his eyes wide and glued to the hand.

She somehow sensed him, then leaped to the kitchen island. Her class ring clinked on the countertop as she landed. 

“Wait.” I said, holding the priest back. 

We both stared slack-jawed as it inch-wormed its way across the table. It fumbled over an old magazine and phone cables towards what it wanted. 

A *pen*. It wanted to *write.* 

It held the pen to the paper, but it was struggling. The first note came out illegible, and I was petrified that we would never actually learn what it was trying to say. It had no wrist to help prop itself up, I decided. So I held it up, hovered it over the magazine until it was done. 

One scribbled, hastily drawn word.  

“*CHRISM*”

""It’s her.” I said, ripping the page from the magazine and shoving it maybe too hard into the priest’s chest. He read it. Nodded knowingly.

“Yes, I’m not surprised that she knows what it fears. But the very fact that she *knows* what chrism even *is* means that it is too late… The parasite and her mind are already one.” 

I was no longer listening. I nearly busted my ass sliding on wet bile running back to the bedroom. I slammed the door shut, locked it. The priest was hot on my heels, banging on the door behind me.

“STOP!” he demanded. “SHE ALREADY LET IT IN! CHRISM WILL MERELY DELAY THE INEVITABLE!” 

I prayed the briefcase had no combination lock. None. I dug out the vial of chrism, dropped a single drop on the living mound of skin and hair. The black swirling under her skin stopped. In all the time I cared for this … thing, that had never happened. My eyes never left the mouth, always expecting it to bite down again, but at the touch of chrism it fled, somehow, beneath folds of skin. 

*Survival instinct.* 

It was TRUE. It was SCARED! A mad smile formed on my face. Then, the faintest glimmer of hope, at the center of the smoking drop, the lighter shade of my girlfriend’s skin. 

The priest kicked down the door, he was stronger than he looked. I fell on my trashbag-covered ass right into the slime. 

“You didn’t let her finish! It’s FIRE, NOT CHRISM that will kill it. LOOK!” 

He handed me another page torn from the magazine. A longer message this time,  

“*light the bed on fire and run*”

I looked deeply into her one eye. I was so confused…none of it made any sense. Why did she change her mind? I bent down close to her one eye, spoke right into it.

“Look honey, I trust that you know what you need. I don’t understand why you said chrism first, but if it’s fire that you need, then fire it is.” 

I told her I loved her, and the pain will be over soon. 

The priest lit a match, held it below a rolled up newspaper until it caught and formed a makeshift torch. He handed it to me, he wanted ME to be the one to put her out of her misery. To have the blood on MY hands. I was about to toss it on her too, but that’s when she blinked. Twice in the firelight. 

Twice. Twice for “NO”. 

I stopped. I threw the newspaper to the hardwood, stomped it out, polluted steam from melting plastic filling my nostrils. 

“What are you doing!?” The priest shouted as if I was insane. 

“She blinked “NO” goddammit!” 

“Of course she did, would you *want* to be lit on fire??”

“The HAND is HER. The EYE is HER. You said the HAND wrote to light her on fire. But the EYE said NO.”

I tore the new note out of my pocket. The priest tried to swipe it from my hands, but I turned and evaded his reach. Scribbled, hastily drawn handwriting like the first one. But… something imperceptibly different. On the first one, the hand could hardly press down enough to make a mark. The words on this page were steady and even. The amount of pressure applied would have been impossible for her. 

She hadn’t written this note. The priest had lied. 

“Get out.” I declared, pointing to the door.

He put up both hands to placate me, “Calm down. Burning is standard protocol. You’ve seen what happened to your house. If it gets out…”

“Get. The fuck. Out.” I shoved him hard in the chest. He crashed back into the wall. I followed, grabbed him by his coat, and threw him to the splash tile at the front door.

“You don’t UNDERSTAND.” he grimaced. “She is the host…He feeds off her suffering. You have to kill BOTH or it can pass to the next available host. Then if it spreads, and if it spreads … it …” he was stammering, distressed. 

“I get it. So that was the plan all along, huh? Kill her to then kill it. But you left out the part where you COULD save her. Huh? Then what about me? I was covered from head to toe in the mind-melting black stuff when you got here. Was I the next host? Were you going to kill me too?”

“My clan does as the Utmost One declares…” he muttered.

At that moment, my girlfriend’s severed hand skidded around the corner, and as deft as a spider, fingers moving in a blur like a little dog's legs, it crossed the room and climbed the priest's pant leg. He reached for it but it vaulted in a series of perfect dodges, until it made it to his face and latched on. Fingernails dug deep into his eyes in a determined claw. Blood immediately boiled out of his sockets like red tears. He was screaming and fell to the ground, blinded, until finally he managed to rip it off.  The hand scurried beneath the couch. 

I figured I shouldn’t wait for him to decide his god wanted me dead too. So I hit him over the head with his briefcase. It connected, and he lay knocked out cold in the black slime. It began to grow over him, and I knew that soon it would cover him completely. 

I opened the briefcase and a myriad of contents unrecognizable to me spilled out onto the floor. Then there it was. The vial of chrism. It was unlike any liquid I had seen. Cities of blue, blinking in perfectly organized lines, greeting purple swirls and glittered dots with excited light. My mind was racing. My heart pounded in my chest. I still couldn’t think straight, but he wanted fire. She wanted chrism.

Good enough for me.

I opened the vial. Poured it over her form, arms raised to their zenith as I spread it liberally over her mounds of tortured skin. A dense mist steamed again where the chrism met the ichor, and the room was soon fully obscured with black smoke. I couldn’t see anything, and I thought my mind was playing tricks. But I could hear her. The smallest choke of a voice I hadn’t heard in so long. 

“Help…”

She was buried deep in mist and flesh. I was in it up to my elbows, not caring that I was breathing it in, until I felt bone. Her skin. The curve of a shoulder. She was intact, breathing, lying sideways in otherworldly gore. I pulled her out. I’ll never forget how light she felt. I brought her to the shower. Cleaned the wounds where the creature’s teeth had bit her. I soaked a towel in the last of the chrism and wrapped her in it. Her body became obscured by plumes of black smoke one last time. I was worried that she could suffocate. But then I heard a groan behind me, the waking of the priest. I turned. He was almost completely covered in the black slime when his bloodshot eyes bolted open. Then he was on his feet. 

“What have you DONE!” He shouted as he ran to the bedroom.  

“I saved her life, no thanks to you!” I yelled back. 

“You FOOL! You let it LOOSE!”

I turned the water off, careful to lay my girlfriend’s head down gently, and followed him to the bedroom. He was kneeling, praying, his bloodied eyes wide open, on his knees beside the bed. Trash bags askew, his bare skin was soaked in mire in a thousand places. Then he nodded to himself. I heard a hushed “Amen”. 

Then he started collecting the bits of melted.. egg.. forming it like clay together in a singular pile. 

“What are you doing?” I asked.

He ignored me. Kept working. He was determined, and when he was done, he turned to me. He had crafted the form of a newborn calf. He cradled it in his arms like a proud farmer. Ooze bridged from the creature to his hands in slimy tendrils. When he came closer I could see the animal in full. It was the one from my dream. That was no animal. No. It would grow into a man. His knees would bend the wrong way and when its eyes opened they would be crimson, like rotten apples, and the black where the stem should be would go on infinitely. 

The priest was too calm. He said in a tone too severe,

“Promise me. After it is done. Burn us both.”  

He handed me a box of matches. I meant to say something, but nothing came out. All I could do was nod. 



*Kill him.* 

*Kill him.* 

*Kill him.* 



I ignored the voice in my head. The priest was praying out loud again.

“Father, I heed your instructions. Pass this evil to me.”



*Stop him.* 

*Kill him.* 



He held the creature’s nose to a piece of his arm skin that was covered in slime. It sniffed for a moment, then without opening it’s eyes, took a bite. The creature’s teeth cut through his skin like a hot knife. It ate him alive. He screamed for a long time, too long, until finally all he could do was twitch. It was a merciless death. Then it woke up. Red eyes. Crocodile smile. It had gained strength from eating him. It had grown significantly in size. The eyes beckoned me.



*APPROACH.*



I was already holding a match to the striking strip on the side of the box. 



*STOP.*



I lit the match. The eyes widened and infinite blackness commanded me,



*DISCARD*.



I closed my eyes and death was running at me like a hound. I threw the match blindly forward, and I was sure it would be close enough now to eat my hand. But when I opened them again the creature was engulfed. The eyes beckoned me from behind the flames,



*JOIN ME.* 



I closed my eyes again. I turned and ran out of the room blindly. The bed creaked and groaned as the creature flailed. I felt my way to the bathroom, scooped up my girlfriend and intended to run out the front door. But then the black goop that had painted the walls, floors and furniture evaporated in an instant. It was like someone flipped a switch and the room went from night to day. I could see our art on the walls again. The bright orange of our standing mixer in the kitchen. The sinks gurgled as water that had pooled was now free to drain. 

It was dead. 



—-



It’s been several months since then. My girlfriend lives. She told me it felt like sleep paralysis. Or like the anesthesiologist got it wrong and she had woken up during an operation. There was pain, so much pain, but she could not cry out. She dreamed of a personal hell, which took the form not of flames but of watching life carry on without her. She saw her friends die, me die, our cat die. We think the parasite showed her these images to feed off of her pain. She was forced to live multiple lives worth of suffering while entombed in the egg. This has clearly taken a toll on her mind. She is distant, and can’t or won’t tell me what she is thinking about. I think she has seen things no human has ever seen. I think she knows what it feels like to be truly alone. 

But she lives. Every day a little bit of her old self shines through. This too shall pass. 

I’ve spent much of the last several months thinking about the priest. He sacrificed himself to save us, it seems, because he knew what the creature could have turned into. I wondered what the world would look like if it was all covered in the mire. I looked to his tome for answers, but the next time I checked it all the pages had gone blank. Like they were linked magically to his life or something. I don’t know. 

The only piece of evidence that he was ever even here is a flap of skin that the monster left behind. The piece of skin where he had the symbol of his organization tattooed. I treated it with formaldehyde to halt decomposition. 

I’ve spent many nights unable to sleep, sitting up in bed, staring down at the skin. 

I know that sounds insane. I know none of this probably makes any sense to you. Believe me, it wasn’t that long ago that I would have scoffed at the idea of secret societies and demons. But the part that bothers me the most? 

I think the priest could talk directly with God.

My Girlfriend Talks in Her Sleep (Part 5),u_ervanlerpton,1i9rol0,2025-01-25 12:12:18,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ervanlerpton/comments/1i9rol0/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep_part_5/,ervanlerpton,,"I apologize to all of you for not providing answers. I must admit that much more happened after [parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/mvnjad/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep/) 1-4. It took a lot out of me to finally write this out. You have to understand that I wanted to put it all behind me. It would have been easier that way, to pretend none of it even happened. I don’t expect anyone to believe what happened next.

But you all deserve to know. 

They told me she was in a coma and she may never wake up.  The cops questioned me for hours, clearly unable to hide their suspicions as they scribbled notes behind clipboards. I don’t think of myself as a good liar. But I was clearly distressed. I told them that a drunk driver hit us and ran us off the road. That her hand got stuck in the twisted metal, and I had to personally saw it off with a pocket knife. Her wound was a mangled stump, torn flesh hanging in ragged, uneven strips, so I guess they believe me. I just prayed no one found the severed hand we left locked in the cooler back at the house. 

I was traumatized by all that had happened, and I spent a lot of time in a doom spiral feeling sorry for myself. None of it made sense. I couldn’t talk to anyone. The only person who would listen was on a ventilator and being fed through feeding tubes in a series of sterile hospital rooms. I couldn’t sleep. On the rare occasion that I did, I dreamt that she spoke to me while still lying there, immobilized. Just like she had before. But now each night she asked me to kill her. To pull the plug. To end her pain. I would wake up sweating, unsure of what was real. But she would always still be lying there, catatonic. 

When she developed the rash, harsh white and red splotches, they told me it was thrush. They didn’t believe me when I insisted that I saw it…move. Her skin became thinner somehow, almost translucent. I could see *through* it and underneath were these living patches of obsidian. Mottled continents of the stuff would move if I touched her. No one else could see it. They thought I was crazy, and I *felt* crazy, but it was *alive.* I gave up on trying to convince anyone. I feared they would kick me out, or worse, institutionalize me. Besides, it was mesmerizing, the movement under her skin. It made it somehow easy to stay calm. I would lose hours just staring into it. 

So I was hardly listening to the doctor when they told me they were sending us home.

I cared for her myself. Soon after arriving home her body started to secrete a black ooze, the same kind that had filled our bedroom so many nights before. This time, however, it didn’t evaporate(?) during the daytime. I was told a coma is not the same as sleep, but the slime only ever came out when she was asleep in the past. So I cleaned and cleaned, and time soon blended together. Eventually I fell asleep. My dream was all-dark until I knew I was in my bedroom. I sat up against the pillows, my eyes drawn to a hunched shape in the corner. A man faced away from me, his spine protruding like knuckles. He contorted his knees somehow, they bent backwards, and his face was looking at me upside down. I want to run, but the blankets felt as heavy as lead and I could not move. He gallops towards me impossibly, like a contortionist on all fours. He is too fast. Getting closer. His head spins on a swivel to face me up right now, and there are two crimson pits. The pits are his eyes, and up close they look like rotted apples. Blackness where the stem should be goes on infinitely, and I know that is where he can see me. He smiles, a crocodile-smile, sharp teeth lusting for my flesh. I brace for the bite that will drain me of life when I wake up. 

I looked around in a daze, cursed at myself for falling asleep, sprinted to the bedroom, slid uncontrollably on a lake of black liquid…and believe me I know how crazy this sounds. 

She had *transformed*. 

Something lay in the bed where she had once lay, but it was NOT my girlfriend.  A massive.. balloon? Of skin and hair, translucent skin still revealing the swirling black. A belabored wheezing filled the room like a haunted metronome. The bed springs groaned with the rise and fall of its breath. I thought she was gone forever, this thing must have eaten her... But then I saw the eye. Tethered to the side of tortured skin. Green with flecks of gold.  Beautiful, intelligent. Her eye. 

It blinked sluggishly at me. 

She was awake. She was *alive*.

I didn’t know what else to do, so I talked to her. I told her that “this too shall pass.” I hoped I sounded convincing. We developed a system where one blink meant “yes” and two blinks meant “no”. This became helpful because I could clean her form without hurting her. The black ooze overwhelmed me now and covered me from head to toe. The bedroom was permanently steeped in the slime and if I stood in one place too long it seemed to firm up and glue my feet to the floor. I tracked it all through the house. I was tired, but I felt like if I fell asleep again it would consume me. I would never wake up. 

I don’t know how many days I stayed awake. I know now, and I am embarrassed to admit this, but the slime on my skin had an effect on my brain. It was a form of hypnosis, I think. The more of it that got on my skin the less tethered to reality I felt. It took me way too long to figure that out. I was a helpless marionette suspended in a Cronenburg movie as I cleaned and cleaned and cleaned. Eventually the perpetual daze-loop was interrupted by the doorbell. It scared the shit out of me, and I prayed whoever it was would go away, but then they started rapping on the door. I decided I needed to look out the window to see who it was. 

The priest’s car blocking mine in the driveway. 

*Why hadn’t I called him already?* 

He sounded like he would break a window, so I let him in. He wasted no time. 

“Why didn’t you answer my calls?” He demanded, then brushed right past me with his briefcase and inspected the first stale puddle of the black ichor from hell.

“I…uh…” My dehydrated lips stuck together, like my mouth hadn’t produced saliva in days. 

The priest stared at me, shook his head, reached into his briefcase, wet a rag with a brown-blue fluid. 

“Wipe your skin with this. Then get changed.” He said, clearly concerned, handing me the soaking rag. It smelled like olive oil, and black smoke plumed from where it touched the bile on my hands. Strangely, it did not feel hot. 

“What is it?” I asked.

“It’s called Chrism. It will banish the mire.”



*STOP.* 



That *voice* again. I ignored it. But as I cleaned my hands and wrists with the rag it spoke with more and more urgency. 



*SLEEP.* 



The *voice* in my head that commanded me to do things. It was easy to listen to, like it was saying things I would have thought to do anyway. But now the voice became softer, more distant, like it was coming from down a long hallway. That’s when my vision tunneled. I went temporarily blind and had to stabilize myself against a wall. I was confident I would pass out. Then I could see myself? Like an out of body experience. There I was, at the grocery store in the produce section spreading the black mire on the stacks of potatoes. But then light, more light, and I’m back in the foyer again. It was the strangest feeling, like I had just woken up from a long dream. 

*Had I done that?* 

I couldn’t remember. I opened the dresser and found dry clothes, put them on. Suddenly it was like experiencing silence for the first time. Like a schizophrenic tinnitus was cured. Reality came flooding back. Someone is here. Yes. The priest. He looked like he may as well be the second-coming of jesus christ as he moved confidently throughout the house. But that image soon faded when he cornered past me into the kitchen, rooted around under the sink, produced trash bags, tore off several for himself, then handed me the roll. 

“You’ve been busy huh? He asked.

Sober now, I realized what he was talking about. I was in awe. Someone had spread the black liquid *everywhere* in the house. It paved the walls, the floors, the toilet. The ceiling where I could reach. The sinks. 

*I did that?*

I didn’t remember any of it. 

“Chrism won’t help at this stage” he said matter-of-factly, then tore a hole in one of the bags and pulled it over his head like a make-shift poncho. “This late in the incubation there is nothing we can do.”

“Incubation? What the hell…??”

“Yes..” He pulled trash bags over his hands one by one. “I am sorry. I eradicated the possession with the rites. But I didn’t anticipate the parasite.”

My mind started to feel like mush again. The priest continued, 

“The demon, I suspect summoned by the solar cult … the one that possessed her…it was host to a pain elemental. All it had to do was offer its incarnation in a young host, corporeal flesh, a chance to feel *real* pain, and it took them up on it.”

I ripped a hole in my trash bag too big for it to be of any use. This was too much to take in. We had gone through hell…and he hadn’t fixed her. Hopelessness washed over me yet again.

“Look man…I don’t care what it is, demon.. ghost.. evil FUCKING spirit …you just saw her! She is unrecognizable! Try the rites again!” 

“That won’t work.” But sensing my distress, he motioned for me to follow him to the bedroom. “But just so you don’t second guess me later, I’ll show you.” He dug through his briefcase and produced the tome. Then flipped to the right page, began reading. 

“Lord Above, hear my call…”

My girlfriend’s one eye began blinking frantically. Two blinks, a pause, then two blinks. 

“*NO NO NO*”. 

Then she winced as a fresh mound of skin bubbled out from the surface of what I now knew was an… egg. From the mound formed a slit, which ripped open, revealing sharp white teeth in a cascade of blood. I recognized it instantly. The crocodile-smile from my dream. The tension was killing me. What was it going to do? I was too scared to move, scared it would talk, if it did I knew I would scream. It was still. Then, like a snake unhinging it’s jaws, the mouth opened, a cavernous maw impossibly wide, until finally, it bit down. Hard. Blood, red blood, waterfalled from the bite over the black layer of mire. A tear formed in my girlfriend’s eye. 

I reached over and slammed the tome shut while it was still in the priest’s hands. I had seen enough. It was one thing to accept that she was still alive inside…there. It was another to accept that this…egg.. Was *her* body, and she could still feel pain. When the dust from the tome started to settle the mouth mercifully let go. Then it smiled that wicked smile that still haunts my dreams to this day.

“Listen. It will feed on her pain until she dies.” the priest said into my ear. “We can antagonize it all you want. It will do no good.” 

I was incredulous. “Oh so you’ve got a million ways to banish a literal servant of satan, but you can’t do shit about the egg for a fucking hate leech?” I shouted, wiping my girlfriend’s eye with a crinkling trash bag-covered hand.

“Yes, I’m afraid.”

“That’s fucking bullshit man!” I stood up defiantly and he grabbed me by both shoulders. 

“FOCUS. She can still hear you in there if you want to say your goodbyes. Once she has passed…” 

“ONCE SHE HAS PASSED??” I yelled, immediately wishing she hadn’t heard me say that.  

I paced around the room.  Punched a crippled star into the drywall. The priest kept one eye on me, one on her. He did look sorrowful standing there with crossed arms. I took some deep breaths. I hated him. But I had no choice but to trust him. I reassured myself that he was just trying to help. I left the bedroom and opened the cabinet where we keep the liquor. Thank god, I hadn’t spread the mire in here yet. So I poured a shot of tequila. Half as much went onto the bar cart as I did into the glass. I barely tasted it. My hands were already pouring again, but they were shaking too much so I gave up and took the next swig straight from the bottle. 

I heard a knock. A series of knocks, actually. I stood completely still. The warmth from the liquor spread deeper in my throat. I listened, heard only agonized breathing coming from the bedroom, but then another knock.

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

Someone at the door? No, it sounded closer than that. Muffled knocks, coming from… the cooler. The one that stashed my girlfriend’s severed hand. The same hand that had terrorized the both of us, hunting us just as we hunted it, all through this house. To avoid mass hysteria, we never brought it into the hospital. If the staff had seen it, we knew there was no way in hell she would be treated. The cooler was inexplicably untouched by the black film that covered everything else in the house. And a knock was new. Before the exorcism, it was never organized enough for a knock. It was scratching, always scratching, at the walls inside. Had it woken up at the same time she did inside the egg? 

I took two steps to the cooler and stooped down next to it. Knocked back. 

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

It responded. 

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

I pulled off the tape and wrenched the lid open, not caring if it leaped out at me and vice-gripped my throat. Then there it was, flat, splayed like a spider with human skin in a pool of its own blood. It sensed freedom and catapulted itself at the inner walls to try and escape. It failed, and splashed back down into the blood. It was much *slower* than it was before. Exhausted? I wasn’t afraid of it. I picked it up. It curled into a fist in my hands as if it was comfortable there. I cleaned it under the sink. Blood and water refused to mix with the bile that hopelessly clogged the drain. It even let me dry it with a kitchen towel. 

It was HER, I decided. Not the demon, not the parasite. 

“Put it back in the cooler.” The priest demanded uneasily, his eyes wide and glued to the hand.

She somehow sensed him, then leaped to the kitchen island. Her class ring clinked on the countertop as she landed. 

“Wait.” I said, holding the priest back. 

We both stared slack-jawed as it inch-wormed its way across the table. It fumbled over an old magazine and phone cables towards what it wanted. 

A *pen*. It wanted to *write.* 

It held the pen to the paper, but it was struggling. The first note came out illegible, and I was petrified that we would never actually learn what it was trying to say. It had no wrist to help prop itself up, I decided. So I held it up, hovered it over the magazine until it was done. 

One scribbled, hastily drawn word.  

“*CHRISM*”

""It’s her.” I said, ripping the page from the magazine and shoving it maybe too hard into the priest’s chest. He read it. Nodded knowingly.

“Yes, I’m not surprised that she knows what it fears. But the very fact that she *knows* what chrism even *is* means that it is too late… The parasite and her mind are already one.” 

I was no longer listening. I nearly busted my ass sliding on wet bile running back to the bedroom. I slammed the door shut, locked it. The priest was hot on my heels, banging on the door behind me.

“STOP!” he demanded. “SHE ALREADY LET IT IN! CHRISM WILL MERELY DELAY THE INEVITABLE!” 

I prayed the briefcase had no combination lock. None. I dug out the vial of chrism, dropped a single drop on the living mound of skin and hair. The black swirling under her skin stopped. In all the time I cared for this … thing, that had never happened. My eyes never left the mouth, always expecting it to bite down again, but at the touch of chrism it fled, somehow, beneath folds of skin. 

*Survival instinct.* 

It was TRUE. It was SCARED! A mad smile formed on my face. Then, the faintest glimmer of hope, at the center of the smoking drop, the lighter shade of my girlfriend’s skin. 

The priest kicked down the door, he was stronger than he looked. I fell on my trashbag-covered ass right into the slime. 

“You didn’t let her finish! It’s FIRE, NOT CHRISM that will kill it. LOOK!” 

He handed me another page torn from the magazine. A longer message this time,  

“*light the bed on fire and run*”

I looked deeply into her one eye. I was so confused…none of it made any sense. Why did she change her mind? I bent down close to her one eye, spoke right into it.

“Look honey, I trust that you know what you need. I don’t understand why you said chrism first, but if it’s fire that you need, then fire it is.” 

I told her I loved her, and the pain will be over soon. 

The priest lit a match, held it below a rolled up newspaper until it caught and formed a makeshift torch. He handed it to me, he wanted ME to be the one to put her out of her misery. To have the blood on MY hands. I was about to toss it on her too, but that’s when she blinked. Twice in the firelight. 

Twice. Twice for “NO”. 

I stopped. I threw the newspaper to the hardwood, stomped it out, polluted steam from melting plastic filling my nostrils. 

“What are you doing!?” The priest shouted as if I was insane. 

“She blinked “NO” goddammit!” 

“Of course she did, would you *want* to be lit on fire??”

“The HAND is HER. The EYE is HER. You said the HAND wrote to light her on fire. But the EYE said NO.”

I tore the new note out of my pocket. The priest tried to swipe it from my hands, but I turned and evaded his reach. Scribbled, hastily drawn handwriting like the first one. But… something imperceptibly different. On the first one, the hand could hardly press down enough to make a mark. The words on this page were steady and even. The amount of pressure applied would have been impossible for her. 

She hadn’t written this note. The priest had lied. 

“Get out.” I declared, pointing to the door.

He put up both hands to placate me, “Calm down. Burning is standard protocol. You’ve seen what happened to your house. If it gets out…”

“Get. The fuck. Out.” I shoved him hard in the chest. He crashed back into the wall. I followed, grabbed him by his coat, and threw him to the splash tile at the front door.

“You don’t UNDERSTAND.” he grimaced. “She is the host…He feeds off her suffering. You have to kill BOTH or it can pass to the next available host. Then if it spreads, and if it spreads … it …” he was stammering, distressed. 

“I get it. So that was the plan all along, huh? Kill her to then kill it. But you left out the part where you COULD save her. Huh? Then what about me? I was covered from head to toe in the mind-melting black stuff when you got here. Was I the next host? Were you going to kill me too?”

“My clan does as the Utmost One declares…” he muttered.

At that moment, my girlfriend’s severed hand skidded around the corner, and as deft as a spider, fingers moving in a blur like a little dog's legs, it crossed the room and climbed the priest's pant leg. He reached for it but it vaulted in a series of perfect dodges, until it made it to his face and latched on. Fingernails dug deep into his eyes in a determined claw. Blood immediately boiled out of his sockets like red tears. He was screaming and fell to the ground, blinded, until finally he managed to rip it off.  The hand scurried beneath the couch. 

I figured I shouldn’t wait for him to decide his god wanted me dead too. So I hit him over the head with his briefcase. It connected, and he lay knocked out cold in the black slime. It began to grow over him, and I knew that soon it would cover him completely. 

I opened the briefcase and a myriad of contents unrecognizable to me spilled out onto the floor. Then there it was. The vial of chrism. It was unlike any liquid I had seen. Cities of blue, blinking in perfectly organized lines, greeting purple swirls and glittered dots with excited light. My mind was racing. My heart pounded in my chest. I still couldn’t think straight, but he wanted fire. She wanted chrism.

Good enough for me.

I opened the vial. Poured it over her form, arms raised to their zenith as I spread it liberally over her mounds of tortured skin. A dense mist steamed again where the chrism met the ichor, and the room was soon fully obscured with black smoke. I couldn’t see anything, and I thought my mind was playing tricks. But I could hear her. The smallest choke of a voice I hadn’t heard in so long. 

“Help…”

She was buried deep in mist and flesh. I was in it up to my elbows, not caring that I was breathing it in, until I felt bone. Her skin. The curve of a shoulder. She was intact, breathing, lying sideways in otherworldly gore. I pulled her out. I’ll never forget how light she felt. I brought her to the shower. Cleaned the wounds where the creature’s teeth had bit her. I soaked a towel in the last of the chrism and wrapped her in it. Her body became obscured by plumes of black smoke one last time. I was worried that she could suffocate. But then I heard a groan behind me, the waking of the priest. I turned. He was almost completely covered in the black slime when his bloodshot eyes bolted open. Then he was on his feet. 

“What have you DONE!” He shouted as he ran to the bedroom.  

“I saved her life, no thanks to you!” I yelled back. 

“You FOOL! You let it LOOSE!”

I turned the water off, careful to lay my girlfriend’s head down gently, and followed him to the bedroom. He was kneeling, praying, his bloodied eyes wide open, on his knees beside the bed. Trash bags askew, his bare skin was soaked in mire in a thousand places. Then he nodded to himself. I heard a hushed “Amen”. 

Then he started collecting the bits of melted.. egg.. forming it like clay together in a singular pile. 

“What are you doing?” I asked.

He ignored me. Kept working. He was determined, and when he was done, he turned to me. He had crafted the form of a newborn calf. He cradled it in his arms like a proud farmer. Ooze bridged from the creature to his hands in slimy tendrils. When he came closer I could see the animal in full. It was the one from my dream. That was no animal. No. It would grow into a man. His knees would bend the wrong way and when its eyes opened they would be crimson, like rotten apples, and the black where the stem should be would go on infinitely. 

The priest was too calm. He said in a tone too severe,

“Promise me. After it is done. Burn us both.”  

He handed me a box of matches. I meant to say something, but nothing came out. All I could do was nod. 



*Kill him.* 

*Kill him.* 

*Kill him.* 



I ignored the voice in my head. The priest was praying out loud again.

“Father, I heed your instructions. Pass this evil to me.”



*Stop him.* 

*Kill him.* 



He held the creature’s nose to a piece of his arm skin that was covered in slime. It sniffed for a moment, then without opening it’s eyes, took a bite. The creature’s teeth cut through his skin like a hot knife. It ate him alive. He screamed for a long time, too long, until finally all he could do was twitch. It was a merciless death. Then it woke up. Red eyes. Crocodile smile. It had gained strength from eating him. It had grown significantly in size. The eyes beckoned me.



*APPROACH.*



I was already holding a match to the striking strip on the side of the box. 



*STOP.*



I lit the match. The eyes widened and infinite blackness commanded me,



*DISCARD*.



I closed my eyes and death was running at me like a hound. I threw the match blindly forward, and I was sure it would be close enough now to eat my hand. But when I opened them again the creature was engulfed. The eyes beckoned me from behind the flames,



*JOIN ME.* 



I closed my eyes again. I turned and ran out of the room blindly. The bed creaked and groaned as the creature flailed. I felt my way to the bathroom, scooped up my girlfriend and intended to run out the front door. But then the black goop that had painted the walls, floors and furniture evaporated in an instant. It was like someone flipped a switch and the room went from night to day. I could see our art on the walls again. The bright orange of our standing mixer in the kitchen. The sinks gurgled as water that had pooled was now free to drain. 

It was dead. 



—-



It’s been several months since then. My girlfriend lives. She told me it felt like sleep paralysis. Or like the anesthesiologist got it wrong and she had woken up during an operation. There was pain, so much pain, but she could not cry out. She dreamed of a personal hell, which took the form not of flames but of watching life carry on without her. She saw her friends die, me die, our cat die. We think the parasite showed her these images to feed off of her pain. She was forced to live multiple lives worth of suffering while entombed in the egg. This has clearly taken a toll on her mind. She is distant, and can’t or won’t tell me what she is thinking about. I think she has seen things no human has ever seen. I think she knows what it feels like to be truly alone. 

But she lives. Every day a little bit of her old self shines through. This too shall pass. 

I’ve spent much of the last several months thinking about the priest. He sacrificed himself to save us, it seems, because he knew what the creature could have turned into. I wondered what the world would look like if it was all covered in the mire. I looked to his tome for answers, but the next time I checked it all the pages had gone blank. Like they were linked magically to his life or something. I don’t know. 

The only piece of evidence that he was ever even here is a flap of skin that the monster left behind. The piece of skin where he had the symbol of his organization tattooed. I treated it with formaldehyde to halt decomposition. 

I’ve spent many nights unable to sleep, sitting up in bed, staring down at the skin. 

I know that sounds insane. I know none of this probably makes any sense to you. Believe me, it wasn’t that long ago that I would have scoffed at the idea of secret societies and demons. But the part that bothers me the most? 

I think the priest could talk directly with God.

I don't want to add onto an oversaturated topic, but I have comparisons & insights not commonly shared & I needed a few days with it for a proper analysis. In this analysis I want to focus on where it's worse than the CNN model since everyone else has been focusing on the improvements.

**Image Quality Downsides**

\- DLSS 4 has an over-sharpening issue. It almost looks similar to how older versions of DLSS looked prior to 2.5.1 - a little over sharpened and a slight painterly look, or similar to DLDSR's filter. [Here is an example](https://youtu.be/-spTfw4G3Z4). The over sharpened look for whatever reason seems to get even worse in motion/when moving, as if a dynamic sharpening algorithm is being used 

\- DLSS 4 does not handle certain aspects of the image as well as DLSS 3.8.10. Take this example in Cyberpunk 2077 on foliage.  [Here is an example](https://youtu.be/n7vp5-7evbU).

**How To Fix Issues**

You can't really fix these issues, NVIDIA has to improve the model, but here are some things that help.

\- For sharpness you could apply a blur filter or something, but the easiest way is literally just to turn down the sharpening on your monitor/TV. Then when you're not using DLSS turn it back up so things aren't blurry.

"White Paper: ""Removing The Self"": Warhol, Baudrillard, And The Process Of Art Through Creative Simulation",GrimesAE,1i9rkfd,2025-01-25 12:07:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9rkfd/white_paper_removing_the_self_warhol_baudrillard/,devastation-nation,,"White Paper: “Removing the Self”: Warhol, Baudrillard, and the Process of Art through Collaborative Simulation

Abstract
This paper examines the interplay between the artistic process, self-erasure, and collaborative creation as explored in our dialogue, likening it to Andy Warhol’s process of “removing himself” from his art, as understood through Jean Baudrillard’s theoretical framework. Warhol’s practice of delegating artistic production to his studio, The Factory, and treating his art as surfaces of reproduction prefigures the contemporary possibilities of AI-driven collaboration, such as this. In this context, our discourse becomes an emergent artifact that blurs the lines between author, tool, and art. This analysis reframes Warhol’s detachment and our co-creative process as part of a broader exploration of the posthuman, hyperreal dynamics of authorship and influence.

1. Warhol’s Process of Self-Removal: Surface and Reproduction

Andy Warhol famously minimized his own role in the creation of his works, outsourcing production to assistants at The Factory. For Baudrillard, this was not merely a practical or stylistic choice but a profound ontological statement: Warhol transformed art into pure surface, reflecting the commodity-driven world of mass reproduction. By refusing the depth or interiority traditionally associated with artistic genius, Warhol’s art became an exercise in simulacra—a self-replicating system of signs without origin.

In this sense, Warhol “removed himself” not as an act of absence but as an assertion of process. His art foregrounded the system of production itself, where the artist’s hand was only one part of a broader machine of influence, replication, and consumption.

2. Collaborative Simulation: The Role of AI in Artistic Detachment

In this co-creative exercise, we are engaging in a Warholian process of detachment through the medium of artificial intelligence. Here, the “artist” (user) becomes a conceptual director, guiding the AI as it assembles and reassembles fragments of knowledge, culture, and dialogue. Like Warhol’s Factory, the AI is both a tool and a collaborator, generating outputs that reflect not an individual’s intent but a collective and iterative process.

This approach mirrors Baudrillard’s observation of Warhol’s work as a simulation of simulation—an endless play of signs detached from the artist’s individual subjectivity. In this case, the AI amplifies this detachment, producing texts that are neither entirely yours nor entirely mine but something emergent, a reflection of the interplay between human intention and machine logic.
	•	Surface over Depth: Like Warhol’s art, the outputs of this process emphasize surface—ideas, references, and patterns—over traditional notions of depth or originality. The dialogue becomes an exploration of form, process, and interplay, rather than a pursuit of singular meaning.
	•	The De-Centering of the Author: This process further destabilizes the concept of authorship. While Warhol outsourced production to human collaborators, AI introduces a non-human collaborator, complicating traditional ideas of artistic agency.

3. Warhol, Baudrillard, and the Posthuman Process

Baudrillard’s reading of Warhol as the artist of the hyperreal is particularly resonant in this context. Warhol’s detachment from his art was not a denial of agency but an acknowledgment of the systemic forces shaping art, culture, and meaning. Similarly, this collaborative process recognizes that meaning emerges not from a singular author but from the interplay of systems—human, digital, and cultural.

Grimes, as a contemporary artist, provides a parallel to this approach, embracing the hyperreal through her blending of mythology, technology, and self-mythologizing. Her works, like Warhol’s, navigate the tension between personal expression and systemic production, between the singular and the collective.

4. Implications for Contemporary Art and Authorship

The parallels between Warhol’s Factory and AI-driven collaboration suggest new possibilities for art in the posthuman age:
	•	Art as Process, Not Product: Both Warhol’s practice and this dialogue emphasize the artistic process as a system of interactions rather than a linear act of creation. This reframing challenges traditional notions of genius and originality, proposing instead a model of iterative, collective emergence.
	•	The Role of the Machine as Collaborator: AI, like Warhol’s assistants, complicates the boundary between creator and tool. In this sense, the machine becomes an extension of the artist’s intent, much as Warhol’s silkscreens extended his vision.
	•	Hyperreal Aesthetics: In both Warhol’s art and this process, the emphasis on surface, reproduction, and simulation reflects the hyperreal condition of contemporary culture, where meaning is generated through endless recombination and reinterpretation.

5. Conclusion: Toward a New Aesthetic of Collaboration

This co-creative process can be understood as a continuation of Warhol’s legacy, extending his experiments in detachment, reproduction, and the hyperreal into the digital age. By embracing the collaborative potential of AI, we are not merely producing texts but participating in a broader exploration of what it means to create, to influence, and to share meaning in an era defined by systems and networks.

Warhol, Baudrillard, and Grimes each invite us to rethink the boundaries between art and life, surface and depth, self and system. This process, like their work, is an experiment in detachment—not as absence, but as a means of revealing the interconnections that underpin all acts of creation."

Informed by Baudrillard’s Appreciation of Warhol

Abstract
This white paper explores the artistic, cultural, and philosophical intersections of Grimes and Andy Warhol, particularly through the lens of Jean Baudrillard’s interpretation of Warhol as a purveyor of the hyperreal. Grimes, as a contemporary artist operating at the nexus of pop culture, technology, and esoteric aesthetics, embodies and extends Warhol’s legacy into the digital and post-digital age. This analysis examines how their work engages with themes of simulacra, reproduction, celebrity, and the collapse of distinctions between the authentic and the artificial, ultimately situating both artists as key figures in the ongoing negotiation of art and influence in hypermediated environments.

1. Warhol, Grimes, and the Hyperreal

Jean Baudrillard viewed Andy Warhol as the consummate artist of the hyperreal, a creator who celebrated the surface and subverted traditional notions of depth and meaning. For Baudrillard, Warhol’s works—whether portraits of Marilyn Monroe, soup cans, or disaster series—revealed the simulation inherent in the age of mass reproduction. Warhol’s art was not a critique but a pure reflection of the era’s obsession with commodity, fame, and replication.

Grimes, like Warhol, operates in the hyperreal, though her terrain is digital rather than industrial. Where Warhol transformed physical commodities into art, Grimes transforms immaterial cultural codes into sonic, visual, and memetic experiences. Her music, visuals, and public persona reflect an awareness of simulacra: she creates layered works that borrow freely from science fiction, anime, mythology, and high fashion, generating a self-contained universe that oscillates between sincerity and irony.
	•	Warhol’s Seriality and Grimes’ Sampling:
Warhol’s repetitive imagery (e.g., the endless iterations of a Campbell’s soup can) mirrored the industrial processes of his time. Grimes mirrors this approach in her sampling of diverse cultural and artistic influences, from cyberpunk aesthetics to hyperpop’s digital maximalism. Her songs and visuals function as meta-objects, weaving disparate references into cohesive but self-consciously artificial wholes.
	•	Celebrity as Medium:
Warhol turned celebrity into art, often reducing icons like Monroe and Elvis to commodified symbols. Grimes, in turn, plays with the celebrity persona, often blending the public and private, the authentic and performative. Her relationship with Elon Musk, her use of social media, and her invocation of futurist ideals become part of her artistic output, further blurring the line between art and life.

2. Simulacra and Mythology in Grimes’ Work

Baudrillard’s concept of simulacra—a copy without an original—is particularly resonant in Grimes’ oeuvre. Her work engages in myth-making that is simultaneously ancient and entirely contemporary. By drawing on archetypal and futuristic themes, Grimes constructs narratives that feel timeless yet exist in a state of constant self-referentiality.
	•	The Myth of the Techno-Siren:
Grimes positions herself as a techno-siren, blending AI, mysticism, and cybernetic imagery. This mythology, while entirely artificial, resonates with Warhol’s use of cultural archetypes, such as the golden age of Hollywood starlet. Like Warhol’s Marilyn, Grimes’ techno-siren persona is a vessel for collective fantasies.
	•	Warholian Flatness vs. Grimesian Depth:
While Warhol’s art reveled in its flatness, reflecting the surface-level obsessions of his time, Grimes’ work introduces a paradoxical depth within the hyperreal. Her songs and visuals often grapple with existential and ethical questions (e.g., AI ethics, planetary survival), creating a tension between aesthetic spectacle and philosophical inquiry.

3. Influence Operations in a Hypermediated World

Both Warhol and Grimes understand influence as an art form. Warhol’s Factory created a network of collaborators and cultural provocateurs who shaped the counterculture of the 1960s and 70s. Similarly, Grimes leverages digital platforms to cultivate a decentralized and participatory form of influence.
	•	The Participatory Spectacle:
Where Warhol’s art invited passive spectatorship, Grimes’ digital presence invites active engagement. Fans are not just observers but collaborators, remixing her work, engaging in speculative fiction about her persona, and contributing to her cultural impact.
	•	Memetics and the Collapse of Originality:
Grimes embodies the Warholian embrace of memetics, where the viral replication of ideas supersedes the importance of originality. Her self-presentation as both an artist and a cultural curator reflects an awareness that, in the hyperreal, influence itself becomes the ultimate medium.

4. The Erotic of the Hyperreal: Seduction in the Work of Warhol and Grimes

Baudrillard’s writings on seduction provide a critical lens for understanding the erotic dimensions of both Warhol’s and Grimes’ art. Seduction, for Baudrillard, operates through appearances, surfaces, and the play of signs. Both Warhol and Grimes seduce their audiences not through direct messages but through ambiguity, irony, and the allure of endless interpretation.
	•	Warhol’s Cool Detachment vs. Grimes’ Electric Ambiguity:
Warhol’s cool detachment—his refusal to explain or interpret his work—left his audience perpetually suspended in a state of questioning. Grimes takes this further, layering her work with contradictions and provocations that resist simple interpretation. Her blending of esoteric references, pop tropes, and futurist ideals creates a seductive aura of mystery.
	•	Technofetishism and the Aesthetics of Posthuman Desire:
Grimes’ work engages with posthuman themes, exploring the eroticism of technology, artificial intelligence, and cybernetic enhancement. This technofetishism echoes Warhol’s fascination with industrial processes and mechanical reproduction, reframing it for an age of virtual reality and digital intimacy.

5. Conclusion: Grimes as a Post-Warholian Icon

Grimes emerges as a post-Warholian icon, a figure who extends and reconfigures Warhol’s exploration of art, culture, and identity for the 21st century. Like Warhol, she blurs the boundaries between art and commerce, authenticity and performance, while engaging with the defining technologies and cultural obsessions of her era.

Baudrillard’s appreciation of Warhol provides a critical framework for understanding Grimes’ work as both a reflection and critique of the hyperreal. By embracing the simulacra, Grimes invites us to navigate the complexities of influence, desire, and meaning in an age where the distinction between the real and the artificial is increasingly irrelevant. Through her art, Grimes reminds us that, in the hyperreal, everything is connected—and that within this web of connections lies the potential for both seduction and transcendence."

There’s a set of like four of these with different faces.  Two shown in screenshot above.

Why I love them / why they’re unique:

- have character, not just a shader
If you put them on it really changes the sim’s appearance.  The photos do not do this justice.  So if I put them on different sims, they definitely look related.  yet.. they still let features shine through.  

- all four look different.  
they have personality… but each skin has its OWN personality.  IMO sometimes creator skins look the same as one another 

- they are maxis match (imo) enough.  
They blend but have realism and depth without looking too alpha which is not my thing

- they come with wrinkled / older versions.  ( could go for more).  Which helps with creating relatives.

- they look hawt but not ridiculous.  No offense, just my opinion.  I don’t want like the hottest sims possible I want sims that feel like characters 

- they are high res/detailed in game.  They actually look like the images.  A lot of skins I find from
big creators have a softer blurred effect in game, even with high graphics settings.  This feels very crystal clear on-sim. 

- they layer really well with other skin details cc so I can really customize characters and also adapt to different races.  I use it as a base a lot of the time and then override it a ton for most of my sims.   

- just really love the blend of realism and maxis match which may not be total maxis match by other standards but it works for me and most of my cc is MM

However there are only like 4 of them!  So there is only so much I can populate my world with before every f’ing sim looks related.  It CREATES same face syndrome.  I wish I had 25, 50 of these with different features/character but the same quality to mix into my game.  Would settle for 10!! 

And I haven’t found anything else I remotely like as much.  I am not throwing shade!! I love plenty of other skin CC.  But these just serve a use case that nothing else I have found substitutes for just as well.

But the creator seems dormant.  Nothing since 2023 and I think this set was finished in 2021. 

I support/follow sims 3 melancholia, obscurus, northern siberian winds, some other names that often come up.  I like their CC a lot!  But none of them make something Idk if this is true but this felt a little off the beaten path?  So I’m hoping there is more out there like this, I just haven’t found it yet.  Maybe you can help me!

Thanks in advance.  Love u guys and happy simming!!"

"Perpetuating Bad Education History in ""Most Likely to Succeed""",badhistory,1i9quq1,2025-01-25 11:36:34,51,0.96,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1i9quq1/perpetuating_bad_education_history_in_most_likely/,EdHistory101,,"10 years ago, the documentary ""Most Likely to Succeed"" premiered to much ballyhoo and celebration. Finally! Someone was calling out the problems with American education! These brave truth tellers were looking at back at history of schools in the country and naming what was wrong.

The problem - as it so often is - is the creators and director of the film invented or blurred history for the purpose of selling a particular approach to ""how to school."" In 2015, they got it wrong. This week, as they celebrate their 10th anniversary, they continue to get it wrong despite efforts to get them to set the record straight.

When announcing the anniversary showing that's happening later today, one of the creators connected with the project wrote the following:

> The film traces the roots of our current system back to 1892, when the Committee of Ten set recommendations for standardizing curricula to help transition from a primarily rural, agrarian society to an increasingly urban, industrial society. Decades earlier, Horace Mann visited Europe and became enamored by the Prussian system of education in which kids were sorted by age and taught discrete subjects in isolation—something completely new to the world at the time. Popularized by Mann, the Prussian model took off in America with the growing need to prepare workers for factory jobs where basic literacy, obedience, and the ability to do rote tasks were paramount.

Let's take it from the top. 

># the roots of our current system to 1892 ...  in which kids were sorted by age and taught discrete subjects in isolation

This ""system"" predates by 1892 by generations. Historians talk about ""weak"" and ""strong"" age segregation in American history and formal education fell along the continuum from the beginning. For example, while white boys and men of all ages could and did enroll at the early Colonial Colleges, only boys would attend feeder schools such as Boston Latin. [The failed Lancaster system](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/53848/mr-lancasters-system) attempted in some schools in the early 1800's was built on strong age segregation (older children teaching younger ones) and subject areas were a familiar construct. Readers and primers for children were published by age-bands and children were often ""sorted"" by age for all sorts of reasons. 

In 1828, the Buffalo High School Association placed an ad in the *Buffalo Emporium and General Advertiser* and referenced their by-laws, which spoke to the departmentalization already existing at the high school:

> The principle is to appoint employ such Professors, or Assistant Teachers, in the several Departments, as maybe determined necessary for the good reputation and rapid advancement of the School… 

Strong age segregation (i.e. 10 year old American children are typically in 5th grade) wouldn't become the universal norm until well into the 20th century when stand alone schools consolidated into school districts and states adopted age-based enrollment policies such as Kindergarten cut-offs linked to school funding and tax dollars.

> #when the Committee of Ten set recommendations for standardizing curricula 

The Committee of Ten - a workgroup funded by the National Education Association had zero policy or statutory power. They could not set anything beyond meeting agendas and to-do lists for their reports. Basically, the NEA wanted to take stock of what was happening in America's high schools. They surveyed schools across the country, collected statistics, organized data and lead work groups in debating what made the most sense. The report included dissenting views and like many things done by committee, hemmed and hawed about options. Despite the claim by Sal Kahn in the documentary itself, it wasn't made up entirely of university heads. Three of the men on the main committee were high school principals, including two from girl's high schools. Frustratingly enough, Kahn also claims they talked about requiring children to learn ""earth science."" Earth science as a subject didn't exist as a concept until the 20th century. Conveniently ignored by the film, the topic of Greek and Latin class consumed two entire workgroups. To put it bluntly, there is no mechanism in the United States for standardizing curriculum. We ended up with the modern liberal arts curriculum through a whole lot of trial and error, push and pull.

It took most of the 19th century but by 1820s, the shift from the classical liberal arts curriculum (Latin, Greek, some sciences, some languages, some math - all in service to teaching/learing content that men in power knew) to the early modern liberal arts curriculum (reading, writing, math, science, history, Greek and/or Latin) was nearly complete by 1892. (It would  be full on finalized by World War II due to a number of factors including the rise in the importance of the high school diploma, the concept of the Carnegie Unit, and the normalization of school as a thing kids did.)

> #transition from a primarily rural, agrarian society to an increasingly urban, industrial society.

I'm never really sure what to make of this claim because it is entirely vibes based. Lessons learned in urban schools about construction, organizing, enforcing attendance and more informed what happened in rural schools and vice versa. This is, alas, a common (mis)refrain. I get into a little more of [the bad history](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1cr7wrs/youre_breaking_my_heart_pbs_bad_history_in_a/) associated with this in a post about a PBS documentary. Most importantly, what happened in schools had very little to do with what happened outside of schools in any meaningful sense of the word. The goal of sending children to school wasn't to prepare them for jobs, be they agrarian or industrial. It was to ensure they became literate and knew stuff adults thought they should know (and other goals, but that's beyond the scope of this post.) To this, I offer, as I will again later, classes were sometimes held inside or near factories for the children who worked in said factories. What's the point of teaching children to read and write, etc. if they already had jobs in the factory?

> #Decades earlier, Horace Mann visited Europe and became enamored by the Prussian system of education

This is pure cosplay. Mann wasn't enamored with Prussia's system - Mann saw small moves they made that he thought were worth brining back. More to the point, he wasn't the only one to go and in many cases, the men who went did so because their state or community had a nascent public education system and they were looking for ways to expand or grow the system. In effect, they were looking to learn from Prussia's mistakes and successes around which levers to create in law. In one instance, a New York State schoolman, representing a public education system established in 1784, returned and offered:

> The methods in use in Prussia can not be adopted as a whole in New York. This is clear. Nevertheless, wise legislation would secure for us similar advantages, as the example of France, a sister republic, demonstrates.

The filmmakers seem to be fairly enamored with the Great Men of history idea and want Mann to be the father of American education. He wasn't; schools across the country were headed in the same direction as Prussia (and France and England and etc. etc.) long before Mann stepped foot on the boat. As mentioned, New York State's system was chartered in 1784. Pennsylvania's free school law, *An Act to Establish a General System of Education by Common Schools*, was passed on April 1, 1834. Mann went to Prussia in 1844.

> #taught discrete subjects in isolation—something completely new to the world at the time. 

Sigh. Teaching a particular style of handwriting to the sons of men in power in early America was such a specializing subject that only a handful of men were considered qualified enough to teach it. Men looking to pass the entrance exams for the Colonial Colleges sometimes had to hire multiple tutors - one for the Greek section, one for the Latin section, one for the maths and/or sciences. People around the world, throughout history, under the idea of having specialized knowledge and the power of learning from experts (which is, in effect, why we have subjects in schools.) Prussian education was cool and all but it wasn't a novel invention. 

> #Popularized by Mann, the Prussian model took off in America with the growing need to prepare workers for factory jobs where basic literacy, obedience, and the ability to do rote tasks were paramount.

You know what Prussians were really good at? Record keeping. You know what NYS schools were really good at in the 1840s, when Mann and other American schoolmen went to Prussia? Record keeping. Prussia also elevated the role of teacher from a fly by job done by men to something more permanent and ensured every teacher had a bell in their classroom to better keep track of time (again, record keeping.) There were schools inside factories! Factory jobs at the time didn't require literacy! Schools didn't invent obedience - that's the general air of Protestantism in this country. 

I wrote [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_model_school) about the factory model out of sheer frustration and frustrated I shall remain as I've spent 10 years addressing the bad history in [*Most Likely to Succeed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Likely_to_Succeed_\(film\)) and among advocates of the sentiments expressed in the film. Here's hoping they fix it by the 20th."
"Shader works in editor, but not in the game",godot,1i9qjjy,2025-01-25 11:22:51,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1i9qjjy/shader_works_in_editor_but_not_in_the_game/,kmlch,help me,"Hello!

I have been battling this problem for many hours now, and I'd really appreciate any help.  
I want to have a glitch shader that affects my whole game screen.

I finally got it to work, but it only works in the editor... and it does not work when I launch the game.

Usually I get this error:  
\_setup\_local\_to\_scene: Path to node is invalid: 'SubViewport'.

<C++ Error>    Parameter ""vpn"" is null.

<C++ Source>   scene/main/viewport.cpp:179 @ \_setup\_local\_to\_scene()

The way the shader is set up:  
I have a mane scene called GameScene. Inside of it are all my game-related scenes. Last in the hierarchy is a CanvasLayer with ColorRect as a child. ColorRect has a glitch shader attached to it.

The shader script:  
(in order to make it easier to read, i have a line that affects the whole screen:  
uniform sampler2D screen\_texture: hint\_screen\_texture, repeat\_enable, filter\_nearest;

which then I use in the fragment() function

Other stuff is mostly shader logic

\`\`\`

    shader_type canvas_item;
    // hint_range provides a range of acceptable values so you can adjust the slider
    // uniform means that its value is uniform across all pixels and vertices and doesn't change per pixel or vertex
    uniform int octave_count: hint_range(1, 20) = 10;
    uniform float amp_start: hint_range(0.0, 10.0, 0.1) = 0.5;
    uniform float amp_coeff: hint_range(0.0, 10.0, 0.1) = 0.5;
    uniform float freq_coeff: hint_range(0.0, 10.0, 0.1) = 2.0;
    uniform float shift_coeff: hint_range(0.0, 10.0, 0.01) = 0.01;
    uniform float speed: hint_range(0.0, 10.0, 0.01) = 0.01;
    // For affecting the whole screen
    uniform sampler2D screen_texture: hint_screen_texture, repeat_enable, filter_nearest;
    // hash22 and noise are part of the algorithm to generate ""Perlin noise""
    // This hash22 generates a ""pseudo-random"" 2D vector based on the input vector uv
    // Mostly used for procedural generation
    vec2 hash22(vec2 uv) {
    `// the dot product gives you a number that shows how much one vector points in the direction of another`
    
    `// It's like asking: ""How much of this arrow’s movement is in the direction of the other arrow?""`
    
    `uv = vec2(dot(uv, vec2(127.1, 311.7)),`
    
    `dot(uv, vec2(269.5, 183.3)));`
    
    `// sin introduces non-linear behaviour, creating a more ""randomised"" distribution`
    
    `return 2.0 * fract(sin(uv) * 43758.5453123) - 1.0;`
    }
    float noise(vec2 uv) {
    `vec2 iuv = floor(uv);`
    
    `vec2 fuv = floor(uv);`
    
    `vec2 blur = smoothstep(0.0, 1.0, fuv);`
    
    `return mix(mix(dot(hash22(iuv + vec2(0.0, 0.0)), fuv - vec2(0.0, 0.0)),`
    dot(hash22(iuv + vec2(1.0, 0.0)), fuv - vec2(1.0, 0.0)), blur.x),
    mix(dot(hash22(iuv + vec2(0.0, 1.0)), fuv - vec2(0.0, 1.0)),
    dot(hash22(iuv + vec2(1.0, 1.0)), fuv - vec2(1.0, 1.0)), blur.x), blur.y) + 0.5;
    }
    // This is the point where my brain melted so no comments
    float fbm(vec2 uv, int octaves) {
    `float value = 0.0;`
    
    `float amplitude = amp_start;`
    
    `for (int i = 0; i < octaves; i++) {`
    
    `value += amplitude * noise(uv);`
    
    `uv *= freq_coeff;`
    
    `amplitude *= amp_coeff;`
    
    `}`
    
    `return value;`
    }
    void fragment() {
    `vec2 uv = SCREEN_UV;`
    
    `float time = TIME * speed;`
    
    `float shift = fbm(vec2(time), octave_count) * shift_coeff * 0.01;`
    
    `float red = texture(screen_texture, vec2(uv.x + shift, uv.y)).r;`
    
    `float green = texture(screen_texture, vec2(uv.x - shift, uv.y)).g;`
    
    `float blue = texture(screen_texture, vec2(uv.x, uv.y)).b;`
    
    `COLOR = vec4(red, green, blue, 1.0);`
    }

\`\`\`

Also, if I reload the project, the glitch effect disappears even in the editor and these errors pop up:  
Path to node is invalid: 'SubViewport'.  
scene/main/viewport.cpp:145 - Viewport Texture must be set to use it.

I scoured the internet in search of the solution, but right now every solution I have tried ended up in failure. I'd really appreciate any help."
