I'm trying to make some other investments outside of the pond just to be safe and I noticed this one.

It's currently #3 on Coinbase for highest gains in 24 hours and it's gained over 2,100% trading volume in the last 24 hours also. And it's only up 15%.

It seems like it's got a lot of potential to me but what do you guys think? Is it worth investing in now to pair with my other assets as a backup investment?

Aventus (AVT) is a layer-2 blockchain protocol that aims to enhance the functionality of Ethereum transactions by addressing scalability issues, high costs, and slow transaction speeds. Built on Substrate, Aventus is designed to be a layer-2 solution not only for Ethereum but also for Polkadot and beyond, with the intention of fostering mass blockchain adoption through crosschain functionality. It aims to provide enterprises with the scale, speed, and cost-effectiveness they need, while maintaining security across multiple blockchain networks. How does Aventus work? Aventus operates by allowing businesses to build on top of the Ethereum network using its secondlayer protocol. This approach aims to solve the scalability issues that Ethereum faces due to its limited transaction throughput. The Aventus Network (AvN) can theoretically handle up to 2,000 transactions per second, a capacity higher than Ethereum's. Furthermore, the AvN aims to process a token transfer within 0.13 seconds, a quicker time than the Ethereum blockchain. The average transaction cost on the Aventus Network is intended to start at just $0.01 (paid in AVT) and decrease over time, making it a cost-effective "

This might be the best time for accumulating alts for people coming from stocks seeing the green crypto market!! Exploring Small-Cap Cryptocurrencies for Stable Profits that are actually performing..,shitcoinmoonshots,17h0ewh,2023-10-26 12:28:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shitcoinmoonshots/comments/17h0ewh/this_might_be_the_best_time_for_accumulating_alts/,Electrical-Nobody259,New Utility Coin,"&#x200B;

In the world of cryptocurrencies, there's more to explore than just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Small-cap ""Dino Alts"" offer potential profits without the wild volatility. Here are five worth considering:

1. **Cartesi (CTSI):** A chain-agnostic L2 scaling solution for decentralized apps, with a peak price of $0.32 in April 2023.
2. **Morpheus Network (MNW):** Revolutionizing supply chain management and offering high staking rewards of up to 18%.
3. **Tron (TRX):** Facilitating cost-effective P2P content sharing with governance participation and staking rewards.
4. **Aventus (AVT):** A hidden gem for Layer-2 Ethereum solutions, scaling businesses and processing transactions efficiently.
5. **Syscoin (SYS):** Combines the strengths of Ethereum and Bitcoin, offering scalability at an affordable cost.

Here's a quick snapshot of their performance and potential:

1. Cartesi (CTSI) - Price: $0.13, Potential Upside (2030): 598% ($0.91).
2. Morpheus Network (MNW) - Price: $1.06, Potential Upside (2030): 990% ($11.56).
3. Tron (TRX) - Price: $0.09, Potential Upside (2030): 733% ($0.75).
4. Aventus Network (AVT) - Price: $0.70, Potential Upside (2030): 700% ($4.98).
5. Syscoin (SYS) - Price: $0.08, Potential Upside (2030): 1900% ($1.61).

Consider diversifying your portfolio beyond major coins. ""Dino Alts"" have shown resilience, delivered returns, and offer promising opportunities. It's your chance to explore and invest in these smaller crypto gems."
"Exploring Small-Cap Cryptocurrencies for Potential Profits and Stability. As cryptocurrency enthusiasts, we often find ourselves engrossed in the allure of Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, there's another avenue to explore for potentially substantial returns without the wild volatility.",AllCryptoBets,17h0age,2023-10-26 12:23:24,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/17h0age/exploring_smallcap_cryptocurrencies_for_potential/,Electrical-Nobody259,Market Update ,"&#x200B;

The success of a cryptocurrency is typically determined by its fundamentals, real-world applications, and the strength of its community. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have certainly proven their worth in the crypto space, small-cap cryptocurrencies, especially those with staking capabilities, are quietly making waves by addressing real-world problems and offering investors a chance at substantial returns and passive income.

Here's a list of five small-cap cryptocurrencies that have shown resilience in the bear market and hold significant potential:

1. **Cartesi (CTSI):** Cartesi is an L2 scaling solution designed for decentralized applications. It's chain-agnostic, providing scalability and flexibility through both off-chain and on-chain solutions. With features like optimistic rollups, its native token, CTSI, reached a peak of $0.32 in April 2023.
2. **Morpheus Network (MNW):** Morpheus Network focuses on disrupting global supply chains by integrating technologies like IoT, RFID, and blockchain. It's making waves in the supply chain management sector. Additionally, you can participate in its masternode program and earn impressive APY (Annual Percentage Yield) and staking rewards of up to 18%.
3. **Tron (TRX):** Tron offers cost-effective P2P sharing of digital content and empowers creators to sell their work without transaction fees. The blockchain uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake, allowing token holders to stake TRX for governance participation and staking rewards.
4. **Aventus (AVT):** Aventus Network is a hidden gem among Layer-2 Ethereum solutions, helping businesses scale and process transactions at significantly higher speeds and lower costs. It also operates as one of the parachains of Polkadot.
5. **Syscoin (SYS):** Syscoin combines the strengths of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, creating a dual-layer blockchain that marries Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This results in high scalability at an affordable cost.

Here's a quick snapshot of how these ""Dino Alts"" are performing:

1. Cartesi (CTSI) - Price: $0.13, Market Cap: $102M, ATH: $1.75, Staking APY: 8.8%, Potential Upside (2030): 598% ($0.91).
2. Morpheus Network (MNW) - Price: $1.06, Market Cap: $50M, ATH: $4.99, Staking APY: 18%, Potential Upside (2030): 990% ($11.56).
3. Tron (TRX) - Price: $0.09, Market Cap: $8.07B, ATH: $0.23, Staking APY: 3.62%, Potential Upside (2030): 733% ($0.75).
4. Aventus Network (AVT) - Price: $0.70, Market Cap: $7.51M, ATH: $7.04, Staking APY: 11.60%, Potential Upside (2030): 700% ($4.98).
5. Syscoin (SYS) - Price: $0.08, Market Cap: $61M, ATH: $1.31, Staking APY: 3.5%, Potential Upside (2030): 1900% ($1.61).

Morpheus Network (MNW) appears to be a standout performer in this list, offering a small-cap token with tremendous potential. The combination of its real-world utility and high staking returns makes it a promising choice for those looking to diversify their investments.

In conclusion, it's essential to consider diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin and a few well-known blue-chip coins. Small-cap ""Dino Alts"" have demonstrated resilience during bear markets, injected portfolios with substantial returns and passive income, and show significant potential for the future. This could be your opportunity to make a big impact in the crypto space. So, don't hesitate to explore and invest in these little crypto gems."
The most recent Kraken listing,CryptoCurrency,155l9eq,2023-07-21 07:26:46,43,0.74,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/155l9eq/the_most_recent_kraken_listing/,RuneW007,ANALYSIS,"Hello everyone, yesterday I decided to make a post about the 5 latest listings on Kraken.  Today it caught my eye that a new coin got listed called Aventus (AVT) with just a market cap of just 5 million dollars and a diluted market cap of around 9 million dollars, ranking it at number 901 on the crypto rankboard.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r5flqrqltadb1.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&s=c18cfffe6f78d6e1ce24a5b6d7452ca3252d33a7

I haven't heard about this coin so I decided to do some more research about it. AVT is an Ethereum token that powers Aventus, a scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions. Having a theoretically scale to 2,000 transactions per second, 133 times more then ETH.

It has as volume of around 115,000$ in the past 24 hours.

https://preview.redd.it/cpn0kyltyadb1.png?width=1905&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c83d2146da51496ca80c459b15600ec61700e06

&#x200B;

I find it strange that they would list this coin, when we see that the daily trading volume is that low. I guess that Kraken doesn't care about that, and just wants to make some money from the fees. This would make it possible for other low market cap and low volume coins to be listed. 

Anyway, have a good day today! Tomorrow is saturday, remember that."

I will also mention some of the upcoming events / catalysts that you might not have heard about if you haven't been watching the Telegram closely.

I have been using my time during the bear market researching promising small cap cryptos... and out of 15 different coins that I am excited about, Aventus is the one that I am the most bullish on, and below will describe why.

Please do your own research and form your own opinions. I am not a financial advisor, and I am not giving any type of advice in writing this. I am simply sharing facts I have gathered about Aventus... in addition to some of my own opinions. Do not place trades based on what is written here.

# Ethereum Layer 2 + Polkadot parachain

Aventus recently secured a parachain slot on Polkadot, which means that in addition to being a layer 2 on Ethereum like Polygon, they are also integrating with Polkadot to become an interoperable cross-chain blockchain.

https://preview.redd.it/gj5ddqejveu91.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=0834cf5eaa833354d7f4464bfcac13cfa64bb96f

# New BIG partner announcements coming up (Bigger than Heathrow airport!?)

Before we mention existing partnerships... in the interview linked below Alan Vey mentions upcoming announcements of their **""first few big big enterprise names"".** Keep in mind that he said this after they had already announced their partnership with Heathrow airport... the largest airport in London. To me this can only mean that they have even bigger and more recognizable clients to be announced soon.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scqi34UK2UQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scqi34UK2UQ)

# Use cases & Partnerships

As mentioned above, Aventus Network is partnered with Heathrow airport, the largest airport in London and one of the largest airports in the world. You can learn more about how Heathrow airport will be using Aventus technology to increase efficiency. Alan also talks about this in the interview linked above.

[https://www.aventus.io/aventus-to-overhaul-operational-efficiency-of-airline-cargo-with-blockchain/](https://www.aventus.io/aventus-to-overhaul-operational-efficiency-of-airline-cargo-with-blockchain/)

Aventus already has several partnerships with companies that use their technology in a wide variety of use cases. As mentioned in the beginning of this post, these partnerships have amounted to **over 20 million transactions on their network**!

* Video games (Play to Earn)
* Event Ticketing (Scalping, Engagement)
* Loyalty (Cashback)
* Provenance (Commodity Supply Chain)
* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
* More coming!

# How Aventus compares to similar technologies

This comparison is directly from the Aventus website:

# Soon to launch on 2 new exchanges

This is something that many people do not know about. Alan Vey mentioned one day that Aventus was in contact with **Kraken and Binance**... and that (at the time) one of them had agreed to list Aventus after announcing the parachain proposition. Shortly after on another day, Alan said that 2 major exchange launches would be happening when they go for the parachain slot. The parachain slot has now been secured!

Putting 2 & 2 together... I think most of us know which 2 exchanges that Aventus is going to be listed on soon!

https://preview.redd.it/neqw8pg2yeu91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64a7dc26dfab96e51bc42f5520939f675ff22148

# What is the market cap & growth potential?

The market cap of Aventus (AVT) is currently at 16 million. That's million, not billion! It is among the lowest market cap cryptos on Coinbase. Let's do some simple math to see what the price would be if Aventus reached a few different levels for market cap. Remember this is just saying ""what if"". You decide for yourself how high you think the market cap can go.

Let's keep it simple and multiply by factors of 10.

If the market cap goes to **160 million**, this would be a **10x gain**

If the market cap goes to **1.6 billion**, this would be a **100x gain**

If the market cap goes to **16 billion**, this would be a **1000x gain**

If Aventus reaches only a small portion of Polygon / MATIC all-time high market cap (20 billion)... an investment at the current prices could potentially multiply by hundreds. But again, form your own opinion on the potential growth for Aventus, based on your own research and calculations.

# 92% in circulating supply!

Let's make sure this is clear... the Aventus team has confirmed that Coingecko contains the correct circulating supply data, and so note that tokens in circulating supply is 92%, (not 60% as indicated by Coinmarketcap)

# Solid team building during the bear market

The Aventus team has been working hard during the bear market, and their team is very public. You can see that they introduce their employees on YouTube, and that the CEO Alan Vey takes every opportunity to answer questions, do interviews, and spread the word about Aventus. They listen to their community, and they are working hard on the tech + forming partnerships.

Like many blockchain projects, they have been focused on fundamentals first, and holding the hype until the market is ready.

# Staking + API

Aventus has a staking program so that you can help secure the network + earn a yield by holding AVT... and they also have an API so that developers can easily implement their technology!

You can find lots of extra information about Aventus on their website, their Twitter page, their Telegram, their newly created Discord, or other places like Reddit, Coinmarketcap, or Stocktwits.

Personally I cannot wait for the upcoming exchange listing / partnership announcements, and I am excited to see what Aventus does in the next bull run.

In another AMA, Alan also mentioned 2 partnerships that developed when Aventus met in UAE... and he gives some detail on that in the second image below, without revealing who it is yet.

That‚Äôs just my opinion of course. Do your own research and make your own decision about what you think of Aventus. This is not financial advice. I am not advising you in any way. Do your own research. Do not place trades based on what I write.

# What is Aventus Network?

‚ÄúAventus network is a customizable layer 2 network that lets any business or dapp build on top of Ethereum and other chains at scale, to process transactions 133x the speed and at just 1% of the normal cost‚Äù

Aventus is also becoming a parachain on Polkadot, which will give Aventus the very unique benefit of being a network that is interoperable with other chains.

[https://github.com/AventusProtocolFoundation/docs/blob/master/resources/Aventus%20Network%20Technical%20Whitepaper.pdf](https://github.com/AventusProtocolFoundation/docs/blob/master/resources/Aventus%20Network%20Technical%20Whitepaper.pdf)

# Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum

Ethereum is a victim of it‚Äôs own success‚Ä¶ having high gas fees and slow transactions. ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù is a technology that scales Ethereum to be faster and cheaper, while still inheriting the security of Ethereum. Aventus network is one of these amazing layer 2 technologies.

**2,000 TPS (133 times faster than Ethereum)**

**1 cent transactions (99% cheaper than Ethereum)**

https://preview.redd.it/aombtnlicnz81.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5151cb2007df12d85d78d71c7bc7b03f4c1bd2f3

# Interoperability (Ethereum, Polkadot, and beyond!)

**Aventus will be more than just an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution‚Ä¶ it will also be an interoperable Polkadot ‚Äúparachain‚Äù** (More about parachains later). Aventus has also said that they want to integrate with Cardano after Polkadot.

An ‚Äúinteroperable blockchain‚Äù can move data and assets from one blockchain network to another. Polkadot is what enables this interoperability. Creating a bridge between different networks / ecosystems is one of the reasons that Polkadot + Aventus technology is so amazing!

I am just as excited about the adoption of Ethereum layer 2, as I am for the adoption of Polkadot parachains. These are two incredibly powerful technologies that are catching on quickly / will be huge‚Ä¶ and Aventus fits into both categories, being an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, and soon to be a Polkadot parachain as well.

Aventus Network has partnered with Scytale Ventures, (a leading blockchain venture capital and consulting firm) to help integrate Aventus Network (AvN) into the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Alan Vey, Co-Founder and CEO of the Aventus Network, said:** ‚ÄúImagine a world in which you couldn‚Äôt send emails from Gmail to Microsoft ‚Äì or you couldn‚Äôt view the same webpage on both a PC and a Macintosh. That‚Äôs the problem facing blockchain right now ‚Äì thousands of different projects are built on different languages, and they cannot talk to each other. Polkadot is the solution to this - bridging different chains and giving them a common language. Integrating into the Polkadot family has always been an ambition for Aventus, and with Scytale‚Äôs expertise and capital injection we have the rocket fuel we need to reach our goal of ensuring true interoperability with the wider blockchain community.‚Äù

# Enterprise grade

Aventus has been successfully serving it‚Äôs clients who bring millions of transactions to the Aventus network. They have been focusing on serving traditional businesses so far, but they are expanding from B2B (Business to Business), into B2C (Business to Consumer) as well. They have just released their gateway API which will enable any business or developer to build on Aventus network. They already support a variety of use cases, and Aventus is expanding into even more use cases & partnerships.

**Anna Frankowska (CCO):** ‚ÄúAventus was built to scale and serve any and all business models that are limited by the current capabilities of Ethereum‚Äù

**Alan Vey (CEO):** ‚ÄúDefi has not been our focus so far.... but more and more it will play a role in the future of the Aventus network.‚Äù

# Where to buy AVT

Aventus is listed on several exchanges, and Alan Vey recently said in an AMA that Aventus was in contact with both Kraken and Binance.

* **Coinbase**
* **Bittrex**
* **UniSwap**
* **Gate.io**
* (Soon to be Binance or Kraken)

**Alan Vey (CEO):** ‚ÄúWe are actively working on Kraken and Binance. One of which has already agreed listing when we formally announce our parachain proposition‚Äù

# Things to look forward to

There are several upcoming announcements to look forward to with Aventus! These are the big ones that I know of:

* The staking program opens this month
* Upcoming announcement of ‚Äúvery high profile client deals‚Äù to be announced this quarter
* Aventus is becoming a parachain on Polkadot this year
* Getting listed on Kraken or Binance
* Hackathon rumors?

In response to a question that someone asked Alan Vey in a recent AMA (Is Aventus Network on track to reach 1 billion transactions by the end of 2022), **Alan replied:** ‚ÄúIt is hard to predict the future especially in bearish markets. Given some of the very high profile client deals we will be announcing over this quarter it is certainly possible.‚Äù

# Gateway API

Aventus has just launched its gateway API, which means that any business can integrate with Aventus to build blockchain applications and run fast & low-cost transactions on the Aventus Network.

# AVT circulating supply is 88%, not 60%

(CoinGecko has the correct amount, confirmed by the Aventus team)

Coinbase and CoinMarketCap are displaying the incorrect circulating supply for AVT. The Aventus team is aware of this and has been trying to get it corrected, but they confirmed that CoinGecko shows the correct circulating supply.

That being said, many people think that the circulating supply is 6,000,000 (60%)... when it is actually 8,800,967 (88%). To have such strong fundamentals / technology, such a low market cap, and such a high circulating supply, is amazing!

https://preview.redd.it/cewbdt8bdnz81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=83bdb102c9ab91ce542809c21b222730c0bacc20

# AVT Market Cap: Incredibly low

At the moment, Aventus has a **market cap of about 8 million** according to CoinGecko. Not 8 billion, not 800 million, not 80 million, but 8 million!

Let‚Äôs play the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù game. These are NOT projections, only ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. Decide for yourself how high you think Aventus can go.

From the current price, if Aventus goes to 50 million market cap, that‚Äôs \~6x increase

If Aventus goes to 100 million market cap, that‚Äôs \~12x increase

If Aventus goes to 250 million market cap, that‚Äôs \~31x increase

If Aventus goes to 500 million market cap, that‚Äôs \~62x increase

# Aventus flying under the radar, until now

**Aventus has been silently working on getting the fundamentals and technology perfected, but now they are ready to share their technology with the world**. They have been doing exactly that recently, and their community is starting to grow.

I have personally seen their Twitter presence growing quickly, and I watched their Telegram numbers grow from about 6k to about 10k within a month or so. They confirmed that they are starting a Discord soon, and they recently hired a new social media manager. Alan Vey has been doing many AMA interviews, telling the world about Aventus.

In addition to the other upcoming announcements mentioned above, it‚Äôs good to note that Aventus will soon have support from the Polkadot community, in addition to the Ethereum community. **The Aventus tech as well as the community, will be powered by both Ethereum and Polkadot.**

**Alan Vey (CEO):** ‚ÄúAs you may already know, unlike many blockchain projects where hype comes before fundamentals (to everyone's disappointment)... we have been very much focused on building the technology to support enterprise partnerships, as fundamentals always win long-term in our perspective‚Äù

# Future / further scaling

Ethereum 2.0 will be released soon, and what a lot of people do not realize, is that layer 2 is an essential part of the scalability that ETH 2.0 can bring. It is **layer 2 technology that unlocks the scalability of ETH 2.0**. So many people have the false notion that ETH 2.0 will make layer 2 obsolete. ETH 2.0 is a fancy new car, and layer 2 is the keys to the car. Layer 2 is they key to scaling Ethereum, with or without Ethereum 2.0.

**Alan Vey (CEO):** ‚ÄúWe have significant bandwith, we know various ways optimizing our system and on top of optimizing just a single system... horizontally scaling that system, so we feel very confident we can deal with any of the usage that is tangibly going to come to the blockchain industry in the next years and beyond‚Äù

# Advocacy from Gavin Wood (founder of Polkadot and co-founder of Ethereum)

**Gavin Wood, Founder of Polkadot, said:** ‚ÄúThe blockchain community has flourished over the last two years and so has the variety of services blockchains provide. The next challenge facing the community is making interoperability between blockchain networks a reality. This is precisely what Aventus‚Äô integration into the Polkadot network will enable, bringing the speed, security and long-term cross-compatibility required for Aventus to work seamlessly with the wider blockchain community. We can‚Äôt wait to see where this takes Aventus ‚Äì the possibilities are endless.‚Äù

# What is the AVT token used for?

If you‚Äôre wondering what the AVT token is used for, below is directly from the Aventus website:

# What is a parachain?

**A parachain is a blockchain that is integrated with the Polkadot network**. Polkadot has a certain number of parachain slots that are available, and so securing a parachain slot on Polkadot is a big deal. **Polkadot enables interoperability, is capable of 1,000 TPS**, and is being eyed by big companies for its parachain slots as well as as an investment among big institutions. The following video from Coin Bureau explains more about Polkadot and parachains.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7S5k5jWp48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7S5k5jWp48)

Aventus will soon become a Parachain, which will mean that **Aventus will be compatible with both Ethereum and Polkadot.**

https://preview.redd.it/a0lzme3ndnz81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b06d7ae8f1e8eef56384425b203d7c233e74a33

I am incredibly excited about Aventus, and the amazing growth that I personally believe is around the corner, both in terms of transactions / adoption, as well as in terms of value. Aventus is super cheap and fast, it‚Äôs interoperable, and it will be a part of the Ethereum layer 2 adoption wave as well as the Polkadot parachain adoption wave.

I never thought that I would be able to get in on such a powerful project at such a low market cap, but again this is my opinions, and you should decide for yourself if you feel the same or not, based on your own research.

Answers from the Aventus (AVT) team about increased future scalability and ETH 2.0 positive impact,AventusAVT,u5m0m4,2022-04-17 08:26:10,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AventusAVT/comments/u5m0m4/answers_from_the_aventus_avt_team_about_increased/,whocaresfucku,Discussion,"Throughout the ""Ask Me Anything"" videos from Aventus, they talk about scalability and answer questions about the impact of Eth 2.0 several times. Since many people want to know about the future capabilities of Aventus technology, below I have included some of the things they have mentioned on this topic.

They are already super fast and super cheap, but as should be expected among layer 2's... they have the ability to scale even (much) further with the release of Eth 2.0. Aventus has multiple options that they can / will implement to scale beyond their already excellent capabilities. It blows my mind how far under the radar this company has flown while building their tech.

&#x200B;

**Question:** When Ethereum network has upgraded from proof of work to proof of stake, will Aventus's TPS capabilities improve from day 1?

**Anna Frankowska:** ""We are constantly making efforts to increase the performance of the EVM. So we expect that around Ethereum's transition period our TPS should be higher. However we do not derive our TPS from Ethereum, but other key Aventus actions regarding transactions are bound to speed up significantly with Ethereum's transition from day 1.""

&#x200B;

**Question:** Why another L2 when this space is crowded by many other L2 projects?

**Andrey Brozhko:** ""The efficiency.. it's faster, it's got predictable cheap costs, and it's more scalable than most other layer 2's out there. We are going after traditional businesses who have a value add from blockchains, not just new markets like defi. The Aventus network is not just a layer 2 that is fully dependent on the layer 1. It is a self-sufficient public enterprise blockchain which is fully interoperable with Ethereum and in the future with other blockchains""

&#x200B;

**Question:** With Ethereum moving to proof of stake soon, how will that affect the Aventus network?

**Andrew Shackleton:** ""The short answer of that is ""It Won't"". We're going to stay interoperable with Ethereum and we'll continue being faster, cheaper, more convenient for any business partners.""

&#x200B;

Additional comments from Alan Vey:

**Alan Vey:** ""We have significant bandwidth, we know various ways of optimizing our system and on top of optimizing just a single system... horizontally scaling that system, so we feel very confident we can deal with any of the usage that is tangibly going to come to the blockchain industry in the next years and beyond""

""We're going to get louder and louder with respect to communicating all the cool fundamentals we have"""

Here is a short üßµto break it down üëá


‚û°Ô∏è 27 of the financial service organisations #EnigmaticSmile (ES) integrates, process #POS transactions for 90% of the World's merchants!!

‚û°Ô∏èVOW currency is built upon #Layer2  @AventusNetwork which posts every merkle root of the transaction data to the base layer #Ethereum!


‚û°Ô∏èES is a PCI Level 1 Service Provider. Level 1 merchants by definition process at least 6million transactions a year! Every merchant that decides to utilise #VOW, means 6million extra transactions per merchant to be processed on top of @AventusNetwork $AVT and posted to #ETH


‚û°Ô∏è  No barrier for end users!
It ensures #Vow adoption at vast scale, without any change of behaviour, or crypto purchases, or any new payment cards for end users! The #crypto side is all on the backend!!! The end user does not need to know or understand! No change for them!


‚û°Ô∏è $2Trillion worth of merchant promises in the form of #discountvouchers, #points, #cashback & #giftcards is spent by consumers. As ES processes 90% of this, that is a $1.8Trillion market per year Vow could intergrate seamlessly!!


@Vowcurrency is highly desirable to Merchantsüëá

‚û°Ô∏è Eliminates cost of refunds & rewards for retailers.

‚û°Ô∏è Centralised Issuance of currency is eliminated via network nodes. 

‚û°Ô∏èTrust in a single party not required to establish integrity of currency supply

‚û°Ô∏è No volatility


‚û°Ô∏è For a merchant issuing #VOW currencies for #loyaltypoints, #cashback or even #Giftcards, initial outlay is 4x less than traditional methods. Eg For every $20 of credit issued to a customer, the merchant only locks $4 worth of VOW which is unlocked when customer spends.


‚û°Ô∏è The previous part of the this üßµ 6/ means that the merchant frees up more liquidity allows more stock to be obtained to sell and can increase profits faster. 

If I was a merchant I certainly be integrating #VOW.

@Vowcurrency &  @AventusNetwork  should be on your radars!"

Aventus price today is $3.09 with a 24-hour trading volume of $5,027,418. AVT price is down -10.0% in the last 24 hours. It has a circulating supply of 9.7 Million AVT coins and a total supply of 10 Million. If you are looking to buy or sell Aventus, Coinbase Exchange is currently the most active exchange. A layer-2 blockchain protocol that brings scalability, lower costs, and speed to Ethereum transactions. Ethereum has scalability issues that make it a victim of its own success. As the blockchain network of choice for most businesses, its maximum transaction throughput is wildly insufficient in meeting demand. The economics of supply and demand have thus skyrocketed transaction fees making them prohibitively expensive. The Aventus Network (AvN) solves that problem by letting businesses build on top of the Ethereum network with Aventus‚Äô second-layer protocol. With the AvN, applications can easily work with any other promising blockchain tech, cross-chain, by plugging into the Polkadot ecosystem, building on Substrate. Benefits of Aventus Scale The Aventus Network (AvN) can theoretically scale to 2,000 transactions per second. This is 133 times more than Ethereum. Price The average transaction cost on the Aventus Network will begin at just $0.01 (paid in AVT) and decrease over time. This is 99% cheaper than the average Ethereum transaction fee over the past year. Speed The AvN will process a token transfer within 0.13 seconds. This is 100 times faster than the Ethereum blockchain. Enterprise Grade The AvN will onboard a minimum of 8.5 million client transactions that have been active in private test networks throughout the past year.

Aventus price today is $3.38 with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,235,003. AVT price is down -6.4% in the last 24 hours. It has a circulating supply of 9.7 Million AVT coins and a total supply of 10 Million. If you are looking to buy or sell Aventus, Uniswap (v3) is currently the most active exchange. A layer-2 blockchain protocol that brings scalability, lower costs, and speed to Ethereum transactions. Ethereum has scalability issues that make it a victim of its own success. As the blockchain network of choice for most businesses, its maximum transaction throughput is wildly insufficient in meeting demand. The economics of supply and demand have thus skyrocketed transaction fees making them prohibitively expensive. The Aventus Network (AvN) solves that problem by letting businesses build on top of the Ethereum network with Aventus‚Äô second-layer protocol. With the AvN, applications can easily work with any other promising blockchain tech, cross-chain, by plugging into the Polkadot ecosystem, building on Substrate. Benefits of Aventus Scale The Aventus Network (AvN) can theoretically scale to 2,000 transactions per second. This is 133 times more than Ethereum. Price The average transaction cost on the Aventus Network will begin at just $0.01 (paid in AVT) and decrease over time. This is 99% cheaper than the average Ethereum transaction fee over the past year. Speed The AvN will process a token transfer within 0.13 seconds. This is 100 times faster than the Ethereum blockchain. Enterprise Grade The AvN will onboard a minimum of 8.5 million client transactions that have been active in private test networks throughout the past year.

Intro:

Aventus network ($AVT) is a true Layer 2 project in which all transactions on the Aventus network (AvN) derive their security from the base layer.
Many projects which people call layer 2s are not actually true layer 2s but more of a side chain in which the security of their transactions are secured mainly by the nodes on their own chain only instead of posting a merkle route of the transaction to a base layer (ZK rollups).

Aventus Network is a layer 2 ahead of its time as not only can it be a scaling solution for Ethereum, a client can chose the base layer in which they want their merkle root of their transactions posted to i.e it can be interoperable with other chains also. Other scaling solutions such  as polygon (Matic) are not interoperable with other chains. 
Aventus is able to be interoperable with other chains due to being built using Polkadots substrate blockchain. This means that it also has the ability to become a parachain on Polkadot network. 

Funding:

Aventus held a ICO in 2017.
They raised over $20million and still have plenty of runway left.
They are backed by Coinshares who launched the world's first regulated bitcoin investment fund in 2014. Coinshares manage >¬£5billion in assets.

Enterprise:

Aventus Network is built for enterprises due to predictable transaction costs of ‚âà$0.01 per transaction and allows clients to be billed in fiat using relay partner Coral's (originally know as Artos)
intuitive API and SDKs that take care of all the crypto token payments to the AvN.

Aventus Network Launches Governance to Democratise Control of Its Network,AventusOfficial,njwsck,2021-05-24 08:26:56,6,0.88,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AventusOfficial/comments/njwsck/aventus_network_launches_governance_to/,AventusNetwork,,"***Aventus token holders can now vote on all major Aventus Network development decisions.***

Aventus Network ‚Äî a layer-2 blockchain protocol that brings scalability, speed and lower costs to Ethereum transactions announced the launch of its community governance platform, providing Aventus Token (AVT) holders with full control over major decisions about the network and greater transparency.

In future, all decisions about parameters, chain configuration, and upgrades related to the Aventus Network (AvN) and AVT will be decided by a binding community vote.

The voting system is being rolled out using the framework via snapshot.page ‚Äî a popular off-chain, gas-less, multi-governance community polling dashboard. Any AVT holder can participate in voting, with each held token equating to a single vote. AVT holders who are part of the Validator Scheme can also participate, receiving two votes for each AVT staked. There are 10 million AVT in circulating supply, with 2.5 million of these staked on the Network.

[Alan Vey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-vey-59a6a797), Co-Founder and CEO of Aventus Network, said: ‚ÄúThe launch of our governance platform ensures that every AVT holder now has a say in deciding the future of Aventus Network. This is part of our wider ethos of driving transparency and robustness in all our activities. Not only do we believe that this is an important step for our Network ‚Äî we believe this approach is the natural next step for blockchain as the technology matures and its use-cases expand. We are 100% committed to being community-led and look forward to engaging directly with our token holders.‚Äù

The first proposals hosted on the platform will be non-binding test proposals, to accurately gauge voter turnout levels and ensure that token holders understand the process.

Why Ethereum?,Aventus,n4gy3j,2021-05-04 01:37:11,7,0.82,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aventus/comments/n4gy3j/why_ethereum/,GameChanging777,,"Has the team considered switching platforms at all? After using Avalanche (AVAX) and the Pangolin (PNG) exchange, I don't see why anyone would want to wait for ETH 2.0 to be released when there's incredible tech out there that can not only run smart contracts and anything else written for Ethereum, but it does it for pennies with sub-second transaction finality. Ethereum is too saturated for Aventus to make it big, but on another blockchain, AVT could have a first mover advantage and really help grow a new ecosystem. It wouldn't necessarily need to be on Avalanche, but that's the only other platform I know of that Ethereum projects can easily transfer to. It's also the only one I've used to swap ERC-20 tokens on. 

I've held my AVT since the ICO because I really liked the idea behind it, but it feels like this project is too small to make it on Ethereum, which is pretty much unusable with its high gas fees anyway. Staking my AVT cost >$150 to stake only a few hundred dollars worth of AVT, but the same thing would've cost less than a dollar with Avalanche. 

I hate to shill another platform like this, but I was seriously blown away by how well it works. I encourage you guys to buy an AVAX, or even 0.1 AVAX to try it out. It supports NFT's too, so NFT ticketing could be an actual thing with Avalanche's low gas fees.

Edit: Someone else from the AVAX community just tweeted about ticketing too. Kinda a different use case than what Aventus is shooting for, but the demand for NFT ticketing is certainly there. https://twitter.com/exgoofy/status/1389755717490331652?s=19

Edit #2: Just wanted to point out that I'm not some random person shilling AVAX on every subreddit. I very rarely post on reddit and my post history is literally just this post + 2 others on this subreddit 3 years ago. I dumped my life savings into the ico and watched it dwindle away over the months that followed, but I really think it was the timing of the crypto market as a whole that stopped AVT from taking off. I'm in a much better position now and really don't mind writing off my losses, but I truly believe this project stands a much better chance of making it big by switching to a blockchain that's just starting to hit critical mass. Regardless of what the team decides, I wish everyone the best."

Part 2 of the Validator Registration Program has actually currently been introduced. It‚Äôs readied to start on March 31 at 9 a.m. UK time and also upright Sunday, April 11 at twelve o‚Äôclock at night. In the month that has actually passed, Aventus has actually launched its very own block traveler, enabling Validators to track purchases on the network and also their connected charges.

[Aventus](https://www.aventus.io/) Network Validators gain a share of purchase charges on the network laying their symbols, making $0.01 per each purchase refined. The network had, at launch, 10 nodes, each with an equivalent possibility of handling purchases performed. Each node has a complete risk of 250,000 AVT and also token owners gain according to their bet symbols.

If an owner has actually bet 25,000 symbols, they will certainly obtain 10% of the purchase charge awards the node makes.

**A Look at the Aventus Network (AvN)**
-----------------------------------

The Aventus Network (AvN) is a second-layer blockchain procedure that allows organisations improve top of the Ethereum network and also procedure purchases at rate and also range, without needing to take care of the increased gas charges on ETH.

Applications utilizing the AvN can quickly collaborate with various other blockchains via cross-chain innovation by connecting with the Polkadot ecological community.
