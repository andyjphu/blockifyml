How to buy 💯,HUNDRED_,1i9aqmj,2025-01-24 19:39:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HUNDRED_/comments/1i9aqmj/how_to_buy/,Equivalent-Bear8030,,"$HUNDRED is available on BNB chain via #Pancakeswap $CAKE and ETH via #Uniswap $UNI

same team. same token.

1. just go to hundredcoin.io
2. click on the logo of the dex you want to go to...Cake logo for Pancakeswap...Uniswap logo for...u know

3. on Uniswap it will pop right up and you'll be able to buy. on Pancakeswap because of their new routing system you may need to make some changes

4. on Pancakeswap click the settings icon and click customize routing

5. Uncheck V2 as HUNDRED is only available on V3. also uncheck split routing and multihop to reduce fees

6. there is no buy or sell tax so keep slippage low. u need BUSD to buy HUNDRED. so if you have BNB u need to exchange it for BUSD

7. once u buy a bag of HUNDRED u won't be able to sell for 100 HOURS. u also won't be able to buy anymore within that 100 HOUR timeframe.

the idea is to teach people to hold. crypto needs holders...not traders. even CZ said if u can't hold u will never be rich. so our idea is to show people the power of holding for just 100 HOURS...what a short time frame! once people see the power of holding that encourages people to continue to hold...at least we think it will."

Should I call BoFA and tell them to clear the funds? like what is happening? how much longer would I be on hold? unreal

Where did my tokens go?,HodlToken,1i90foq,2025-01-24 12:12:20,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HodlToken/comments/1i90foq/where_did_my_tokens_go/,smadaxela,,"I swapped some BNB for HODL yesterday in my coinbase wallet and today I looked to lock in profits and swap back to BNB, 5% tax accepted. However when I tried to swap back to BNB there was a persistent error. But CB wallet doesn't have any sensible error messages. I suspected it could be slippage too tight.

I tried to swap via PancakeSwap but at the confirmation stage I received a ""fraudulent address detected"" error. 

I suspected I might have more luck on UniSwap so sent a test transfer of some BNB to cover gas and a small amount of HODL to try and swap. But the HODL never arrived at my UniSwap wallet.

I checked the transaction on BscScan and I see the tax payment going to HODLToken (I checked that the address matched the HODL token) and the bulk of the transfer go to my wallet address, however neither the inbound transaction nor the token appeared in my uniswap wallet.

Just for fun I downloaded the HODL app amd created a wallet there and transferred an amount from Coinbase wallet to HODL wallet and exactly the same thing has happened. The transaction shows it successfully completing with my HODL wallet address but the tokens aren't appearing in the wallet.

Can anyone explain what might of  happened to my tokens?"

I'd get the AC bill, and have issues with my mother-in-law turning the AC off while opening the windows ... or watching the BTC bounce all over ... and I'd think **HODL BABY.** It MAKES SENSE. IT IS GOING UP. **My then Girlfriend was like - you're an IDIOT.** I was vindicated with time, patience, and not CONSTANTLY LOOKING.

**Looking back - it's hard for me to NOT imagine if I had bought 50x more, instead** 

With that said, **DJT is definitely not dumb... and he** and his team **must have a plan for $TRUMP.**

Haters gonna hate ... but the man **just made a few BILLION** \- *and he has 800 MILLION coin more* to make more.

So I've continued to buy over the last 3 days, and I've brought my average [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/official-trump/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/official-trump/) price to about $38.00/coin. **Yeah, I've invested a bunch.**

**Some of my thoughts:**

*Trump HAS to do SOMETHING* with the $TRUMP COIN because:

**A)** his tech staff is being rewarded with it

**B)** He's on the biggest platform in the world and it's EASY for him to pump $TRUMP

**C)** If it's at $40, then that's $32 BILLION more in inventory to be released at a later date to do stuff with ... and he's NOT going to want it to stay at $40 ... **he'll want $4,000 (3.2 TRILLION) if he can!**

With the #MAGA cheer of #**AmericaFirst** and **the concept of the #CryptoStrategicReserve** (which would be EASILY FILLED UP with confiscated crypto) there is so much he SHOULD do.

1. **Make capital gains off of 'American' crypto projects tax exempt ... he's HIGHLY incented to do so as he just made > $10B on $TRUMP and $MELANIA** and he's notorious for not paying taxes if possible
2. **SELECT #Bitcoin plus the better #AmericanCrypto for the #CryptoStrategicReserve ... so it would have**

. BTC  (required)

. ALGO (an underdog - but it's stakable again)

. Solana ('everyone' is bullish but its at its ATH; I'd skip buying now)

. XRP (required - if there's Crypto Reserve, there's a 99% it's in it)

. Hedera (betting on the failure of XRP. I have 5% of what I have in XRP, and pray.)

. Chainlink (nice, but IMO I can't own decent amounts of EVERYTHING ... yet)

. LTC (yawn... has been?)

. ONDO

. UniSwap

. Sui

**3. Make $TRUMP part of the #CryptoStrategic Reserve!!** There are so many coin, and he's the President ... and he's never been shy about putting himself OUT there.

**AWESOME!** that we have [Travala.com](http://travala.com/) letting people BOOK TRAVEL with $TRUMP I bet we start seeing MORE COMPANIES do the same ...

Standard Chartered believes rising institutional inflows will fuel crypto market recovery amid policy uncertainty,Blockmandev,1i7lv0m,2025-01-22 16:01:15,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i7lv0m/standard_chartered_believes_rising_institutional/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto Bears vs. Bulls: Standard Chartered Predicts Wild Swings with a Bullish Glow  

Digital assets are bracing for a bumpy ride, as short-term volatility looms, thanks to the shaky policy stance of the latest US administration. But don’t sweat it, crypto enthusiasts! Standard Chartered's crystal ball has some glimmering predictions for mid-term gains that might just leave you starry-eyed.  

Geoffrey Kendrick, the brain behind digital assets research at the bank, suggests that the lack of action on crypto policy thus far is like a wet blanket on market momentum. He warns that continued silence could press pause on $BTC and $ETH, elongating the current price drops.  

Still, it’s not all doom and gloom. Kendrick suggests institutional investors could swoop in with fresh capital, driving a rebound. For the courageous, buying the dip now could pay off massively later, with $BTC potentially soaring to $200,000 and $ETH hitting a dazzling $10,000 by the end of 2025.  

As pension funds slowly pivot toward crypto ETFs, their long-term investing nature might be a game-changer, says Kendrick. Only 1% of such funds are dabbling in crypto ETFs, so the sky may just be the limit.  

Looking ahead to 2025, Kendrick divides the market journey into three phases. The first phase, dubbed “when hope dies,” could mean a further 10%-20% slide as optimism takes a back seat. Enter phase two, “buy the dip,” where market policies begin to favor crypto, sparking recovery vibes. The final sweet spot, “altcoin alpha,” may open doors to explosive gains from tokens like $LTC and $UNI once regulations get sorted and ETFs roll out faster than hotcakes.  

Kendrick is optimistic that future adoption will make $BTC and $ETH stronger anchors in the game. He’s got his bets on DeFi too, as projects like Uniswap are poised for stardom due to leaner regulatory burdens.  

The lesson here? While murky days are ahead, long-term strategies could shine through. After all, no news for now might feel like bad news, but it could be paving the way for a boom.

A crypto airdrop is when projects distribute free tokens to users, usually as a promotional strategy or to reward loyal supporters. 🎉

Here’s how it works:

Sign up or join the project’s community (e.g., Uniswap airdropped UNI tokens to early users).  
Complete tasks like social media shares or wallet interactions (e.g., Bitcoin Cash gave tokens to BCH holders).  
Receive free tokens directly to your wallet! 

💰Example: In 2020, 1inch airdropped 6 million tokens to its community, rewarding those who had interacted with the platform.

How to avoid snipers in crypto?,cryptoQandA,1i78fmx,2025-01-22 05:47:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1i78fmx/how_to_avoid_snipers_in_crypto/,Ujowo,,"## Understanding and Mitigating Crypto Sniper Risks

Crypto ""snipers"" refer to individuals or bots that exploit vulnerabilities in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or newly launched tokens to front-run transactions, manipulate prices, or drain liquidity. These actors often target low-liquidity pools, memecoins, or newly listed projects. Below are detailed strategies to minimize exposure to sniper activity.

---

### 1. **Avoid Publicly Announced Launch Times**
   - Snipers monitor social media channels (Telegram, Twitter) for exact launch times of tokens. By publicly announcing a launch window, you create a predictable target.
   - **Alternative**: Use a **stealth launch** by deploying the token contract without prior announcement. This reduces the time window for snipers to prepare bots.
   - For projects, consider a **fair launch** mechanism where tokens are distributed evenly over time (e.g., via bonding curves or gradual liquidity unlocks).

---

### 2. **Liquidity Pool (LP) Strategies**
   - Snipers often target tokens with low initial liquidity. To mitigate this:
     - **Lock Liquidity**: Use a trusted third-party service (e.g., UniCrypt, Team Finance) to lock LP tokens for a predefined period. This prevents sudden liquidity removal.
     - **Increase Initial Liquidity**: Start with a higher liquidity pool (e.g., 10+ ETH) to make price manipulation more expensive for snipers.
     - **Avoid ""Meme"" Tax Structures**: High buy/sell taxes (e.g., 20%) attract snipers who exploit tax arbitrage. Use moderate fees (5–10%) or dynamic fees that adjust based on trade volume.

---

### 3. **Transaction Tactics for Traders**
   - **Use Slippage Tolerance**: Set slippage to 5–15% on DEXs to reduce the risk of front-running. Avoid using ""max slippage"" (e.g., 49%), which is a common target for snipers.
   - **Limit Orders**: Use decentralized limit-order platforms (e.g., UniswapX, 1inch) instead of market orders to specify exact entry/exit prices.
   - **Avoid ""Copy Trading""**: Snipers track wallets of large investors. Manually execute trades rather than following publicized whale activity.

---

### 4. **Contract-Level Safeguards**
   - For developers, implement code-level protections:
     - **Anti-Bot Measures**: Add modifiers to the token contract to block known sniper bot addresses (e.g., blacklisting contracts with `isContract` checks).
     - **Transaction Cooldowns**: Enforce a cooldown period (e.g., 30 seconds) between buys/sells for the same wallet.
     - **Max Transaction Limits**: Cap the percentage of the supply that can be traded in a single transaction (e.g., 1–2% of total supply).

---

### 5. **Monitor and Analyze On-Chain Activity**
   - Use blockchain explorers (Etherscan, BscScan) to track:
     - **Large Wallet Accumulations**: Sudden spikes in holdings by a single address may indicate sniper activity.
     - **Liquidity Changes**: Watch for abrupt additions/removals of liquidity in pools.
   - Tools like **DeFiLlama**, **DexTools**, or **Token Sniffer** can identify suspicious contracts or liquidity patterns.

---

### 6. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Selection**
   - Avoid DEXs with poor resistance to Miner Extractable Value (MEV) or front-running. 
   - Prioritize platforms with:
     - **MEV Protection**: DEXs like CowSwap or aggregators (Matcha) use batch auctions to minimize front-running.
     - **Private Transactions**: Services like Flashbots RPC (Ethereum) allow submitting transactions directly to miners, bypassing public mempools.

---

### 7. **Community Vigilance**
   - **Verify Contract Authenticity**: Ensure the token contract is renounced (ownership transferred to a dead address) and audited.
   - **Watch for Honeypots**: Use tools like Honeypot.is to detect contracts that prevent selling—a common sniper trap.
   - **Report Suspicious Activity**: Flag sniper bots or rug pulls to communities and moderators on platforms like RugDoc or Crypto Twitter.

---

### 8. **Time-Zone and Volume Arbitrage**
   - Snipers often operate during low-activity hours (e.g., late-night U.S. time). Schedule trades or launches during high-volume periods (European or U.S. mornings) when general market activity can dilute sniper impact.

---

### 9. **Legal and Regulatory Awareness**
   - While crypto is decentralized, some jurisdictions penalize market manipulation. Report fraudulent projects to regulatory bodies (e.g., SEC, FCA) if they exhibit clear sniper collusion or fraud."

Uniswap V4 Upgrade Is Set To Fully Launch Next Week!,ethtrader,1i72rh9,2025-01-21 23:16:04,13,0.93,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i72rh9/uniswap_v4_upgrade_is_set_to_fully_launch_next/,BigRon1977,Technicals,"Decentralized exchange Uniswap has announced that its new and fourth version (V4) upgrade will be fully launched next week.

V4 was originally meant to be deployed in Q3 of 2024 but remained in the testing phase for the rest of the year.

Following months of suspense and teasing, Uniswap labs eventually [announced on X ](https://x.com/Uniswap/status/1881810167429501293)hours ago that the deployment...

>""will begin rolling out this week for builders to test hooks and integrations onchain. We expect all contracts to be deployed for a full launch next week. DeFi renaissance in progress, contract addresses will be shared soon""

**What you should know**

Uniswap is the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume. Its primary operations and historical data are associated with Ethereum blockchain.

However Uniswap has expanded beyond Ethereum to other blockchains that support ERC-20 tokens with versions like V2 and V3.

V4 promises to further streamline swapping process, reduce costs, as well as attract more liquidity providers and traders.

One of the key features that make V4 standout are ""Hooks"" which allows developers to execute custom code before and after swaps.

Aside ""Hooks"" there are other interesting features like gas savings, flash accounting, dynamic fees, native ETH support, and multiple pool types.

V4 deployment is promising for Uniswap's native token UNI as the more streamlined swapping process will lead to a high volume of transactions.

As a result, demand for UNI could increase as more users engage with the platform and drive up its value."

I thought I might want to participate in the swapping to acquire small amounts of highly speculative coins, but the fees do not make such small transactions smart for me.

Therefore, I back out of my plan. I looked into their liquidity pools I thought may I will just set there and forget, but given such high fees to get my money out of the wallet/DEX I decided I wont mess with UniSwap for the moment. Now How can I send these coins back to my coinbase app or coinbase walllet without paying half the value in fees



edit 1/19/25  7:04 PM EST:    Coinbase seems to be experiences delays on their base network as well. Gas fees for ETH are currently heavily taxed--traffic is probably too high. So this is probably not fully an issue with Uniswap, but yes. These extreme fees means I shouldn't even use that small amount of ETH right now. "
5 Must-Have DeFi Tokens for 2025,CoinsForge,1i51xs3,2025-01-19 11:11:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinsForge/comments/1i51xs3/5_musthave_defi_tokens_for_2025/,Dunnoman7,,"In recent years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. As the crypto space evolves, identifying promising tokens becomes critical for investors. This guide provides an in-depth look at some of the most promising DeFi tokens, answering key questions like ""What are the top 5 DeFi tokens?"" and ""Which crypto to buy for 2025?"" Let's explore these tokens and their potential in detail.

# What Are the Top 5 DeFi Tokens?

The DeFi space is characterized by innovation and growth, making it challenging to select the best tokens. However, these five stand out for their robust ecosystems, utility, and potential for future growth:

# 1. $STETH (Lido Staked Ether)

$STETH represents Ethereum staked through Lido Finance, a leading liquid staking platform. With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a lucrative option. $STETH allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity, enabling them to use their staked assets across DeFi protocols.

# Why Invest in $STETH?

* Exposure to Ethereum’s growth.
* Dual earnings from staking rewards and DeFi yields.
* A cornerstone asset for Ethereum-based DeFi strategies.

# 2. $LINK (Chainlink)

$LINK powers the Chainlink network, a decentralized oracle solution that connects smart contracts to real-world data. Chainlink’s oracles are integral to DeFi, powering platforms like Aave, Synthetix, and Compound.

**Key Features:**

* High demand due to integration with major protocols.
* Use cases beyond DeFi, including gaming and insurance.
* Staking incentives expected to grow as Chainlink evolves.

# 3. $UNI (Uniswap)

$UNI is the governance token of Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum. As a leader in the DEX space, Uniswap has revolutionized token trading through automated market makers (AMMs).

**Why $UNI Matters:**

* Significant market share in the DEX space.
* Governance power in shaping Uniswap’s future.
* Potential for fee-sharing mechanisms in upcoming updates.

# 4. $AAVE

$AAVE is the native token of the Aave protocol, a decentralized lending platform. Users can lend, borrow, and earn interest without intermediaries. Aave is at the forefront of DeFi’s lending and borrowing ecosystem.

**Notable Advantages:**

* Innovative features like flash loans.
* Cross-chain compatibility (e.g., Polygon and Avalanche).
* Growing adoption among institutional investors.

# 5. $DAI (MakerDAO’s Stablecoin)

$DAI is a decentralized, algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike centralized stablecoins, $DAI is backed by over-collateralized crypto assets, ensuring stability and transparency.

**Why $DAI?**

* Essential for DeFi liquidity pools.
* Preferred stablecoin for decentralized trading.
* Strong backing by MakerDAO’s governance system.

TLDR;

* DEXs captured a ton of market share from CEXs in 2020/21. Tokens like $UNI and $SUSHI soared in tandem.
* Crypto sports betting DEX’s have a minuscule market share relative to centralized betting platforms (Stake, Rollbit, etc.)
* Sports betting is a $200B industry and the combined market cap of all decentralized betting projects is <$150M.
* Sports betting DEX’s have massive advantages over their centralized counterparts (Rollbit, Stake, etc.): better odds, permissionless trading, transparency, self-custody, open API access, aligned incentives with their userbase.
* An inflection point for decentralized betting is close. $SX, the current leader by betting volume & users is highly unknown to the crypto community, despite doing $20M/month in bets.

Here’s my thesis:

Decentralized betting ‘dexes’ are in a similar spot in their lifecycle as DEX’s (like Uniswap) were prior to exploding at the beginning of last cycle.

As DEX’s like Uniswap captured a ton of users, volume, and overall market share from CEX’s like Binance, decentralized exchange tokens like $UNI went completely parabolic almost overnight.

Why? Users realized they could access permissionless trading directly from their non-custodial wallet, enjoy lower fees, transparency, and an open canvas to create unlimited combinations of programmatic Defi applications and strategies to support their trading.

The value proposition could not have been more clear, and the market eventually reflected that.

I think sports betting is bound to see a similar shift from centralized crypto betting platforms like Stake and Rollbit to decentralized, on-chain sports betting platforms, or more specifically, dexes. There are many parallels between these two industries and the advantages of onchain solutions are once again abundantly clear:

* Self-custody - users hold their funds in their own wallet instead of relying on shady platforms to pay them out. This is historically a massive problem for bettors. How many times have we heard horror stories about bettors having their funds locked up when they wish to withdraw?
* Better odds and no fees - decentralized betting platforms are able to offer some of the best odds in the world with unique P2P markets that create competitive pricing. No more 5-7% house edge, bettors profit more money on every bet.
* Transparency - transactions (deposits, withdrawals, bets, payouts) are all transparently recorded onchain and viewable by anyone on the explorer. The historically shady betting industry is dying for some transparency.
* Open access to create betting bots, programmatic betting strategies, tools, defi solutions, the list goes on.

Decentralized betting platforms have an incredibly clear competitive advantage over centralized, traditional betting platforms, and avid sports bettors are starting to take notice, as evidenced by the increase in volume and user numbers across the board. I see decentralized betting as a whole taking a much larger slice of the pie from the $200B sports betting industry, and sooner rather than later.

Key decentralized betting projects:

1. $SX
   1. Token Market Cap: $44M
   2. Flagship Dapp: SX Bet
      1. All-Time Trading Volume: $600M. Currently doing $20M/month
2. $AZUR
   1. Token Market Cap: $7M
   2. Flagship Dapp: Bookmaker XYZ V
      1. All-Time Trading volume: 96M
3. $THALES
   1. Token Market Cap: $10M
   2. Flagship Dapp: Overtime
      1. All-Time Trading Volume: $160M
4. $WINR
   1. Token Market Cap: $19M
   2. Flagship Dapp: Justbet
      1. All-Time betting volume: $93M

The main project I’m eyeing here is $SX / SX Network. They’re a peer-to-peer betting platform (think NYSE for sports bettors), and the current leader in the decentralized betting space by all metrics (annual betting volume, users, etc.).

They’re essentially building the global liquidity hub for sports betting on their own L2 Rollup, SX Network. They have the best odds and liquidity in the world on pre-match betting markets.

They’ve also secured integrations with the largest betting aggregators (think 1INCH, but for sportsbetting) which is getting their odds in front of tons of non-crypto native bettors and creating a wicked flywheel effect:

Better odds → attracts more bettors → attracts more market makers → results in better odds → cycle repeats.

From what I can see, the team behind SX has been hyper-focused on the tech + building an exceptional Dapp and spent far less time trying to get eyes on their token. They’re currently only listed on MEXC & Bitrue, with LP’s on Eth, Arbitrum and their native dex on SX. All around, seeing a measly amount of trading volume currently, it wouldn’t take much to send this flying up. Also, the token is now 100% vested from what I can see, which is super bullish.

Overall, I see $SX as an incredibly undervalued project at 44M relative to other projects in the decentralized prediction market/betting space. If my thesis plays out, $SX, and Gamblefi as a whole is bound to have massive repricing.

As always, DYOR, this is not financial advice.

Why? Users realized they could access permissionless trading directly from their non-custodial wallet, enjoy lower fees, transparency, and an open canvas to create unlimited combinations of programmatic Defi applications and strategies to support their trading.

The value proposition could not have been more clear, and the market reflected that.

I think the $200B sports betting industry is bound to see a similar shift from centralized crypto betting platforms like Stake and Rollbit to decentralized, on-chain sports betting platforms, or more specifically, dexes. There are many parallels between these two industries and the advantages of onchain solutions are once again abundantly clear:

* Self-custody - users hold their funds in their own wallet instead of relying on shady platforms to pay them out. This is historically a massive problem for bettors. How many times have we heard horror stories about bettors having their funds locked up when they wish to withdraw?
* Better odds and no fees - decentralized betting platforms are able to offer some of the best odds in the world with unique P2P markets that create competitive pricing. No more 5-7% house edge, bettors profit more money on every bet.
* Transparency - transactions (deposits, withdrawals, bets, payouts) are all transparently recorded onchain and viewable by anyone on the explorer. The historically shady betting industry is dying for some transparency.
* Open access to create betting bots, programmatic betting strategies, tools, defi solutions, the list goes on.

Decentralized betting platforms have an incredibly clear competitive advantage over centralized, traditional betting platforms, and avid sports bettors are starting to take notice, as evidenced by the increase in volume and user numbers across the board. I see decentralized betting as a whole taking a much larger slice of the pie from the $200B sports betting industry, and sooner rather than later.

Key decentralized betting projects:

1. $SX
   1. Token Market Cap: $44M
   2. Flagship Dapp: SX Bet
      1. All-Time Trading Volume: $600M. Currently doing $20M/month
2. $AZUR
   1. Token Market Cap: $7M
   2. Flagship Dapp: Bookmaker XYZ
      1. All-Time Trading volume: 96M
3. $THALES
   1. Token Market Cap: $10M
   2. Flagship Dapp: Overtime
      1. All-Time Trading Volume: $160M
4. $WINR
   1. Token Market Cap: $19M
   2. Flagship Dapp: Justbet
      1. All-Time betting volume: $93M

The main project I’m eyeing here is $SX / SX Network. CG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sx-network](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sx-network) They’re a peer-to-peer betting platform (think NYSE for sports bettors), and the current leader in the decentralized betting space by all metrics (annual betting volume, users, etc.).

They’re essentially building the global liquidity hub for sports betting on their own L2 Rollup, SX Network. They have the best odds and liquidity in the world on pre-match betting markets.

They’ve also secured integrations with the largest betting aggregators (think 1INCH, but for sports betting) which is getting their odds in front of tons of non-crypto native bettors and creating a wicked flywheel effect:

Better odds → attracts more bettors → attracts more market makers → results in better odds → cycle repeats.

From what I can see, the team behind SX has been hyper-focused on the tech + building an exceptional Dapp and spent far less time trying to get eyes on their token. They’re currently only listed on MEXC & Bitrue, with LP’s on Eth, Arbitrum and their native dex on SX network. All around, it's a measly amount of trading volume currently, it prob wouldn’t take much to send this flying up. Also, the token is now 100% vested from what I can see.

I see $SX as an incredibly undervalued project at 44M relative to other projects in the decentralized prediction market/betting space. If my thesis plays out, $SX, and Gamblefi as a whole is bound to have massive repricing at some point.

As always, DYOR, this is not financial advice. Curious to hear thoughts and opinions on this space & would love to discuss!"

**What you should know:**

Uniswap's primary operations and historical data are associated with Ethereum blockchain. However Uniswap has expanded beyond Ethereum to other blockchains that support ERC-20 tokens wlth versions like V2 and V3.

The expansion enables Uniswap to tap into broder users and increase its liquidity across different ecosystems.

Did you know that the last time Uniswap was reported to have hit a significant volume milestone was in December last year, with a total of $1.565 billion? The milestone surpased the previous record of $1.551 billlion set in November 2024.

Although the ATH was based on volume recorded on just Base chain. So while we can't draw a direct comparison to the latest $18 billion in one week milestone, we can still tell that it indicates a substantial increase in trading activity right?

This development is particularly promising for Uniswap's native token, UNI. With such a high volume of transactions, the demand for UNI could increase as more users engage with the platform and drive up its value.

The governance power of UNI will also become more significant, giving holders a louder voice in shaping Uniswap's future path.

There are even more exciting days ahead as Uniswap is perfecting plans to roll out its latest iteration, known as Uniswap v4 any moment from now.

V4 promises to further streamline the swapping process, reduce costs, as well as attract more liquidity providers and traders."

"QANX : Things to know, thoughts, fud, and speculations...",QANplatform,1hoc6s1,2024-12-28 13:44:15,38,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/QANplatform/comments/1hoc6s1/qanx_things_to_know_thoughts_fud_and_speculations/,Original-Assistant-8,,"If you're reading this, you hopefully understand Qanplatform aims to be much more than ""Quantum Resistant"".  

They have unique utility that will create an ecosystem like no other.  Their solution for post quantum is brilliant, however, as it will be able to fully operate in the ethereum ecosystem.  Users can continue to interact like they are used to with wallets they know.  

You can learn all about the features they have and the vision they are achieving.  My profile probably has enough info alone, but visit the site and chats for more, plus @QANplatform 

I don't offer financial advice, but here are my opinions on a few things that come up time and again.

CMC has not updated the supply figures- you can see on the explorers info button that there was a burn event- reducing supply 33%.  

Also, the old token was halted and allowed to drop to basically 0.0000 - to limit damage from an wallet exploit.  
No one bought below .008 despite this being shown on the charts.  This is fully disclosed and explained in their medium articles- all of which any investor should check out (search qanplatform medium- see the Oct 2022 article)

They restored folks at .012 - obviously investors, partners, and community gained trust, and this just shows they have a project worth fighting for.  It takes a determined team with something they believe in to press on through those difficult times.

Since then, they have been admitted into Linux PQCA. 1 of 20 members alongside the top tech companies in the world like Nvidia, Google, AWS.  They have become business partners with IBM.

The fud primarily comes from project communities that believe winning the post quantum narrative is what matters.  I will continue to explain that all of these projects need to win marketshare from the top 100, not from each other.  As a note- it obviously isn't working to fud QANX.  It is far more effective to focus on the respective vision of the projects.  You won't gain investors by attacking other projects.  QANX community- I know it's hard to resist, but ignore the trolls.

While I do think BTC needs to take action (which people may treat as fud), I am perfectly fine trying to see how it can best upgrade.  I even posted in reddit how I think they should transition short term with no code changes.

It is important for the SOV space, and it will keep the market happy.  In the meantime, a utility project like QANX will get a lot of adoption in the utility space as people realize they were correct to plan for this inevitable risk.

You will see the QANX team is thinking well beyond mainnet launch- they realize partners and ecosystem are where marketshare lives.  

From their site:
Vision: A world where real and helpful use-cases are built on the blockchain.

Mission: Empowering anyone to build rapidly and securely on the blockchain.

They get it.

Now the other things retail investors often bring up.

Liquidity- yes on pancake and uniswap it is relatively low.  But they also have gate, bing, bitmart, and will continue to expand.  If ""whales"" won't buy until there are more buying options, well that's fine by me.  Smaller investors get to be early.  Because we know bigger exchanges will be coming. And when whales are comfortable, they can enter.  
(And to be honest, I think whales know how to accumulate early even if they don't like the liquidity.  Isn't that part of the risk/reward?)

Speaking of uni and pancake.  People think they see certain wallets selling a lot.  There are many arb wallets that balance gate, bitmart, uniswap, and pancake.  Don't confuse that with real selling.  

From what I saw, there were quite a few wallets that were selling back with IBM news and Willow.  Mostly gathering up tether.  I speculate this was for project funds- though this can't be proven.  But if I am right, the project is in good shape for all the mainnet activities.

And so of course we ask, what about marketing?  Well, the team doesn't constantly feed us with news, but when news lands it does get well published.  And the team strategy has always been to market when there is product or news worth marketing.

I've followed this project closely for years- I've been through the pain, and I've endured the endless fud.  While the fud can drive you crazy, look at the results. And go to the chats and see Johann and devs answering questions in real time.  

They continue to do very well, and still have all the catalysts ahead- main, major cex, partners, ecosystem, etc.  And there are already outside projects that will be ready to launch with mainnet.

The project fights on and the team does so with a quiet confidence.  I think 2025 is when all the fud comes to an end.  Cheers"

Speculation Grows Around OpenSea’s Potential Token Launch,cryptoddler,1hl4quj,2024-12-23 22:28:11,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1hl4quj/speculation_grows_around_openseas_potential_token/,Actual_Ad_5440,,"OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, has recently stirred excitement and speculation about the potential launch of its native token, possibly named ""OCEAN."" This move, if confirmed, would represent a significant development for the platform and the broader NFT ecosystem.

# Recent Developments

# The OpenSea Foundation Announcement

* On **December 20, 2024**, the newly established **OpenSea Foundation** shared a cryptic tweet: *“Ocean enters the chat.”*
* This announcement has been interpreted by the crypto community as a hint towards the launch of an **OpenSea token**, tentatively referred to as ""OCEAN.""
* The creation of the OpenSea Foundation, reportedly based in the Cayman Islands, adds weight to the speculation. Foundations based in jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands often serve as legal and operational vehicles for token launches, allowing greater flexibility and compliance with international regulations.

# Community Reaction

* The tweet generated widespread speculation, particularly within NFT and Web3 circles.
* Earlier hints in December 2024 were met with skepticism, but the recent announcement from the OpenSea Foundation has significantly shifted sentiment, with many users expressing optimism about OpenSea’s next strategic move.

# Key Speculations

# Token Utility

While details are scarce, industry insiders and users have speculated on possible utilities for the rumored token:

1. **Governance**:
   * The token could enable decentralized decision-making within the OpenSea ecosystem, giving holders voting rights on key issues such as platform policies, revenue distribution, and feature prioritization.
2. **Fee Discounts**:
   * Similar to Binance’s BNB or Uniswap’s UNI, the token could offer users reduced platform fees, incentivizing its adoption and holding.
3. **Rewards for Activity**:
   * Active traders and creators might receive the token as a reward for their contributions, encouraging further engagement on the platform.

# Potential Airdrop

* There is strong speculation that OpenSea might airdrop ""OCEAN"" tokens to users who have engaged with the platform in the past. This would mirror strategies employed by other platforms like Uniswap (UNI) and Blur (BLUR), which have successfully used airdrops to galvanize user loyalty and attract new participants.
* Factors determining eligibility could include:
   * Total trading volume.
   * Number of NFTs bought/sold.
   * Longevity of activity on the platform.

# Launch Timeline

* Some experts believe the token launch could align with the release of **OpenSea 2.0**, rumored to roll out in late 2024. This new version of the platform may introduce advanced features such as:
   * Leaderboards for tracking top traders and collections.
   * Expanded support for additional blockchains.
   * Gamified rewards and incentives for user activity.

# Why a Token Launch Now?

# Market Dynamics

* **Competition**: OpenSea faces growing competition from platforms like Blur, Magic Eden, and LooksRare, many of which already have native tokens that drive user engagement through rewards and fee reductions. An OpenSea token could be a strategic move to maintain its leadership in the NFT marketplace sector.
* **Innovation in Web3**: Tokens are increasingly viewed as essential tools for aligning incentives between platforms and their users. A native token would solidify OpenSea’s position as a leading innovator in Web3.

# Enhanced Ecosystem

* A token could help OpenSea build a broader ecosystem, connecting users, creators, and collectors in a more integrated and incentivized environment.
* It would also position OpenSea as a key player in decentralized governance, enabling the platform to evolve based on community input.

# Potential Challenges

# Regulatory Scrutiny

* Token launches in the U.S. and other jurisdictions face significant regulatory challenges. OpenSea’s foundation in the Cayman Islands could be a strategic move to mitigate these hurdles, but compliance with global tax and securities laws remains critical.

# Community Expectations

* OpenSea has faced criticism in the past for its centralized decision-making and handling of royalties. If the token launch does not align with community expectations, it could lead to backlash.

# Market Conditions

* The crypto market has experienced volatility, and the success of a token launch would depend heavily on broader market sentiment. OpenSea will need to carefully time its launch to ensure a strong reception.

# Broader Context and Precedents

1. **Uniswap (UNI)**: Uniswap’s airdrop in 2020 distributed tokens to early users, which significantly boosted community loyalty and set the standard for decentralized platform governance. OpenSea could adopt a similar approach.
2. **Blur (BLUR)**: Blur’s aggressive token strategy, including airdrops for traders, helped it capture a significant share of the NFT market. OpenSea might leverage its large user base to regain dominance using a comparable model.
3. **Magic Eden**: As a cross-chain NFT marketplace, Magic Eden has shown the importance of innovation and incentives. OpenSea could integrate lessons from these competitors to enhance its offering.

# Conclusion

While OpenSea has not officially confirmed the launch of a native token, the recent establishment of the **OpenSea Foundation** and its cryptic messaging strongly suggest that a token launch is imminent. If executed well, an ""OCEAN"" token could:

* Strengthen OpenSea’s competitive position in the NFT space.
* Foster deeper community engagement through governance and rewards.
* Align with emerging trends in Web3 innovation.

However, success will depend on how effectively OpenSea navigates regulatory landscapes, community expectations, and the evolving dynamics of the NFT and crypto markets. Investors and users are advised to stay tuned for official announcements from OpenSea regarding the potential token launch."

Would like to thank alot the crypto community here, I've
learned alot from all the discussions and back and forth
of opinions


I started doing well for myself and decided that i need to start investing to help acclerate myself financially (achieve FIRE)


I decided by asking myself how much i can afford to lose to experiment with the crypto market.


Answer was about 1000 euro


Here are my current holdings and weights as you can see

XRP 198.09 XRP   €423.65 down 14.42%


Horizen 12.024 ZEN    €311.33 up 4.81%


Uniswap 14.79 UNI   €188.5 down 16.66%


Chainlink 6.56 LINK  €138.6 down 9.68%


-i noticed all cyprto markets is heavily influenced by bitcoin movement


• my philosophy is to pick coins backed up by an
application in real-life
• i can see there's trends towards end of Q1 in the past 2
years
• my stop losses are at -50%


My goal is to invest for my first 100k


My questions


1- is my portfoli selection ok? How would you improve it?


2-i was shaken by the market going down in the prev 2 weeks, yet decided not be another paper weight Question is .. where should i set my sell limit order?

3-i understand coins are seasonal hence you should
sell/buy and not stick to a coin for more than 6 months.
Any extra guidance here


4- would appreciate any general guidance/tips on how
to be strategic rather than emotional and when to cut ur
losses when necessary


Much thanks in advance "

"The Great Burn, Bullish Investigation",dogelon,1hfwgtr,2024-12-16 18:11:45,51,0.93,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogelon/comments/1hfwgtr/the_great_burn_bullish_investigation/,Parking_Match9861,Discussion,"So I recently dove into how the dev team could achieve a ""great burn"" and found an interesting wallet on etherscan. The #1 holder used to be Methuselah with 43% of total holdings gifted by Vitalik Buterin, now it's Crypto . com  6 as the #1 holder with 21% of total holdings. The weird part is that crypto . com actively trades $ELON but this wallet is only inflows, no outflows. About 212 Trillion tokens in total, that have been accumulating since March of 2023. Crypto . com is the first big U.S. crypto exchange to list $ELON. Maybe ""The Great Burn"" was announced after Methuselah left because now it was possible through a new deal. It also looks like the CTFC approved derivatives for $ELON to be traded through crypto . com's derivatives company (NADEX). What are your thoughts on crypto . com 6's wallet on etherscan? I ran it through AI and provided a CSV file to go over every transaction and it seems to be a staging wallet or a wallet planned for a staged event. Could that be ""The Great Burn""? Also, just bullish in general. All of the bridges, swaps, liquidity pools, and partnerships like Magic Eden, Arbitrum and Caldera, Pyth Network, Orca, MultiBit etc. positions $ELON ahead of the curve when it comes to exposure and being able to get your hands on some Dogelon outside of the ETH chain and UniSwap liquidity pool. Then the plans for Rufus L2 in partnership with Caldera & Arbitrum to lower gas fees and provide rollups and burn mechanisms for transactions on the ETH chain is awesome. Well positioned to get listed on Coinbase, Binance, and Robinhood. All we need is the spotlight and volume so exchanges will want to list. I think it just comes down to the right timing for max exposure, probably during the euphoric meme season stage of this bull cycle. But what do you all think? Do you think this wallet is the wallet that will play a role in ""The Great Burn""? Also, what else are you bullish about that I didn't mention?"

Crypto History: Gaming Timeline for the 2021 Bull Run,KARRATCRYPTO,1heic5d,2024-12-14 20:57:49,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1heic5d/crypto_history_gaming_timeline_for_the_2021_bull/,tracksta6,,"In the 2020–2021 bull run, specific cryptocurrency genres (e.g., meme coins, gaming coins, DeFi tokens) experienced surges of interest at different times. These shifts were driven by evolving market narratives, trends, and hype cycles. Here’s an analysis of when each genre gained major inflows of capital:

https://preview.redd.it/as32vw0t5x6e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c862be8aa72bf4354664f5f98b5d0f9c9a208d7

>**1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - Initial Surge: Mid-2020**

* The DeFi boom began in summer 2020, often referred to as ""DeFi Summer.""
* Key drivers included platforms like Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP), and [Yearn.Finance](http://Yearn.Finance) (YFI), which introduced yield farming and liquidity mining.
* DeFi tokens dominated attention from mid-2020 to early 2021 as users chased high returns and DeFi total value locked (TVL) surged.

>

>**2. Gaming and Metaverse Coins - nitial Surge: Mid-2021**

* Gaming and metaverse tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (MANA) gained traction during Q2–Q3 2021.
* Axie Infinity drove the narrative with its play-to-earn (P2E) model, which saw rapid adoption in emerging markets.
* The metaverse hype reached its peak in late 2021, fueled by Facebook’s rebranding to Meta in October 2021.

>

>**3. Meme Coin** \-  Initial Surge: Early 2021

* Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged in popularity during Q1–Q2 2021.
* Elon Musk’s tweets and the broader retail investor craze (e.g., Reddit-driven pumps) contributed to the explosive growth of DOGE, which peaked in May 2021.
* SHIB followed in Q2–Q3 2021, fueled by its community-driven growth and listing on major exchanges.

>

>**4. Layer-1 Protocols**

* Initial Surge: Late 2020 to Early 2021
* Layer-1 tokens like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) saw significant inflows as Ethereum faced scalability issues.
* From late 2020 through Q3 2021, investors sought alternatives to Ethereum, driving the growth of competing blockchains.

>

>**5. NFT -  Initial Surge: Q1–Q2 2021**

* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in early 2021, driven by projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and major auctions like Beeple’s $69M NFT sale in March 2021.
* The NFT craze aligned closely with the gaming/metaverse hype in Q3–Q4 2021, expanding into broader cultural and entertainment sectors.

>

* **6. Privacy Coins -  Initial Surge: Early to Mid-2021**
* Coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) saw renewed interest in Q1 2021, as concerns about regulatory scrutiny and privacy grew during the bull run.
* This genre's surge was smaller compared to others but aligned with broader crypto adoption.

>Timeline Overview:

* **Genre                        Initial Major Inflows    Peak Interest Period**
* DeFi                          Mid-2020                     Late 2020 – Early 2021
* Gaming/Metaverse   Q2 2021                       Q3 – Q4 2021
* Meme Coins             Early 2021                    Q2 – Q3 2021
* Layer-1s                    Late 2020                    Q2 – Q4 2021
* NFTs                          Q1 2021                       Q2 – Q4 2021
* Privacy Coins            Early 2021                    Mid-2021

>Observations and Takeaways:

>Rotational Capital:

1.  Money rotated through genres as the market narratives shifted.
2.   Early adopters of each genre benefited the most as capital inflows surged.
3.   Gaming as a Late-Stage Winner: Gaming and metaverse coins often peaked later in the cycle, especially during the altcoin season after Bitcoin and Ethereum had their major runs
4.    Meme Coins Thrive on Hype: Meme coins tend to surge during periods of retail euphoria, often spurred by social media campaigns.
5.    DeFi Pioneered the Bull Run: DeFi projects laid the groundwork for mainstream crypto adoption in mid-2020, establishing foundational protocols.

Looking Forward to the Next Bull Run - If historical patterns repeat, gaming/metaverse tokens like Karrat could see their major inflows in the latter stages of the next bull run, likely around Q3–Q4 2025. Meme coins and NFTs might see earlier retail-driven pumps, while DeFi and Layer-1s could kickstart the cycle.

With UNI nearing critical resistance zones, a sustained breakout could open the door to even larger gains. Is this the start of Uniswap’s next big rally?

Key metrics like RSI and BBTrend suggest momentum is on UNI's side. The RSI has climbed sharply, moving up from an oversold 33 just two days ago to a bullish 67. This indicates strong buying pressure but also shows the asset may soon test the overbought zone at 70. If UNI can hold above this level, we could be looking at more upside in the short term.

The BBTrend metric is also showing signs of recovery. While still in the negative, it has improved drastically from -2.47 to -0.82, hinting at fading bearish pressure. If this trend flips positive, UNI buyers could enjoy a fresh wave of momentum.

The $14.5 support level will be key in keeping the uptrend intact. A failure to hold this area could trigger a move back to $13.5. However, if the bulls keep control, resistance at $19.47 could soon be tested, with $20 and $25 becoming realistic targets for the weeks ahead.

Is this a revival of Uniswap’s golden days? Keep your eyes on the charts as the action heats up.

Prominent DAO tokens like Uniswap (UNI) and ApeCoin (APE) are playing significant roles in the realms of DeFi and NFTs, providing holders with voting rights and access to various governance proposals. These projects highlight the growing influence of decentralized communities in shaping the future of blockchain applications.  
  
Among the key platforms emerging in the NFT space is Magic Eden, which launched in 2021 as a multi-chain marketplace supporting networks like Solana, Ethereum, Polygon and Bitcoin. More recently, Magic Eden added support for Arbitrum and ApeChain, expanding its reach in the rapidly growing NFT ecosystem. One of the unique aspects of Magic Eden is its focus on rewarding active users. From December 10, 2024, to February 1, 2025, users will be able to claim $ME tokens based on their activity within the platform.  
  
Additionally, Magic Eden has partnered with PoolX on Bitget  enabling users to lock in their $ME tokens in exchange for extra rewards. This move further highlights how decentralized platforms are leveraging token-based economies to incentivize and engage users. The allocation of $ME tokens, with portions reserved for contributors and strategic investors, points to a growing trend of long-term growth models within DAOs, where both individual users and investors play a role in the platform's development."

Guys... we need an Alt-Coin NASDAQ,Hedera,1hb6jo2,2024-12-10 12:05:10,20,0.86,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1hb6jo2/guys_we_need_an_altcoin_nasdaq/,Chris-G-O,Discussion,"I will keep this as brief as I can make it.

**Alt-Coin market's Top-30 market cap**  
**----------------------------------------------------**

* Use & Utility: \~ $400 Bn
* Ponzis, Memes & Collectibles: \~ $2 Tn

See Appendix below.

Q: Can I expect from this ""market"" to assess - never mind: ""valuate"" - Use & Utility projects?  
A: Nope.

**HBAR ETF**  
**---------------**

Q: If not this market, then which market can valuate Use & Utility?  
A: ""Wall Street"" (used here as a generic term, covering serious investment professionals, incl. ""Institutional"" money managers, etc.)

Q: How can Wall Street access HBAR?  
A: Through an ETF, only.

Q: Is it likely that an HBAR ETF be attractive to Wall Street?  
A: Just take a look at **Hedera's GC:** ***they're all on Wall Street to begin with.***

**HBAR & HBAR ETF = Bitcoin**  
**-----------------------------------------**

One would naively think that the ultimate beneficiary from the potential success of the HBAR ETF would be the HBAR. Think again. Within the current market structure, the ultimate beneficiary of the HBAR's price appreciation is **Bitcoin.**

This is how:

* I spend USD to buy (HBAR/USD).
* After that, while I am in the market, the HBAR/BTC trade pair creates a dynamic in which the HBAR's price increase directly impacts its valuation in BTC terms ***because the increased demand for BTC to trade with HBAR bolsters BTC’s market activity and liquidity.***

E.g. HBAR/BTC.  
Buying HBAR = selling Bitcoin - thus ensuring Bitcoin's liquidity.  
Selling HBAR = buying Bitcoin - thus increasing Bitcoin's price.

This mechanism allows Bitcoin to leech off price and liquidity from every asset on the board that is traded as Coin/BTC.

In turn Bitcoin maintains its position because ***exchanges are free to list Coin/BTC trade pairs as they please.***

Thus, the entire Alt-Coin market is, in reality, a Bitcoin derivative market which, in turn, is controlled by \~ 100 addresses (according [Bitcoin's concentration stats](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)).

**Alt-Coin NASDAQ**  
**--------------------------**

We clearly need another market for Use & Utility Alt-Coins, structured along the lines of the NYSE / NASDAQ paradigm.

In the Alt-Coin world this could potentially mean:

* Alt-Coin Casino market where Ponzis and Memes rule the day.
* Alt-Coin NASDAQ equivalent, where ***investment*** as we know it is offered space to grow and claim its rightful market value - whatever that may be.

Perhaps the (still pending in the US) commodity / security classification could play a role in something like this. I am somewhat certain that with a reasonable deadline and SEC cooperation every serious Use & Utility project out there could classify as ""alt-security"".

**$fiat as Quote Currency**  
\---------------------------------

Needless to mention that the only way to decouple the Atl-Coin NASDAQ from the Alt-Coin Casino is to peg the former on $fiat-as-quote-currency, e.g. HBAR/USD, HBAR/EUR, HBAR/CAD, etc - like the stock market does. 

After all, if its outright criminal for the stock market to list stock/stock trade pairs why should it be legal for the alt-coin market to list crypto/crypto trade pairs?    

**Current Outlook**  
**-----------------------**

Currently (Dec 10, 2024) the new US SEC chair made some statements recently but we haven't had a policy announcement yet.

**Original tokenomics:**

* *Total Supply:* 777.777 trillion $JESUS
* *Liquidity locked:* 9 ETH + 1%
* *Team/marketing/CEX:* 0%
* *Public Presale:* 19%
* *Total Supply Burned (12/25/23)*: 621.24 trillion $JESUS (79.87%)

**Current tokenomics:**

* *Circulating Supply*: 156.5 trillion $JESUS
* *Liquidity locked:* \~ 7 trillion $JESUS (4.7%)
* *Over 95% of the circulating supply is owned by the community*

https://preview.redd.it/yvdpdpr7gu5e1.png?width=1513&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c2226207baed0f92913e0bae6cccf181b970e14

# Why is there a discrepancy between market cap and FDV?

79.87% of the supply of $JESUS was burned on 12/25/23. Those tokens are forever burned and can never be unlocked or released. The FDV includes those tokens.

# Why does the #1 wallet hold 80% of the supply on Ethereum?

The #1 Wallet is the Burned Supply. It is in a locked smart contract, owned by the burn address (0x0000).

https://preview.redd.it/rjm7qc49gu5e1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f1e14291d4bf72a5b4ea755d7b2557fe6b86ea

# Can you verify the 80% Token Burn?

The 80% Supply Burn is verifiable on chain here.

The Safe: 0x71B5759d73262FBb223956913ecF4ecC51057641

The Lock: 0x20a058326b2ebf96dad8f2d30f0682566fbd6d5ab5245f7394272f384f340baf

The Burn: 0x961de8ee1b7a97bfb355c2aad52c2cf6f1179d72246063be94aa979647b249d1

CoinGecko has also independently verified our [Supply Burn.](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jesus-coin) The burned tokens are stuck in a smart contract called [PinkLock 02](https://legacy.pinksale.finance/pinklock/record/1004705?chain=ETH) (Lock ID 1004705). All tokens launched on the PinkSale launch pad also use this contract for locking/unlocking. (So there’s a lot of activity in that address.)

https://preview.redd.it/a8o35u5agu5e1.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4940517cdcd124ee28008a1e0818eb5ae96fab7

**Here’s the best way to explain it.**

1. *PinkLock 02 is a bank.*
2. *The tokens are locked in a Safe within the bank.*
3. *The key to the locked Safe was thrown into a volcano.*
4. *The PinkLock contract is immutable (meaning, it can’t be changed).*
5. *No one can ever open the Safe or change the lock unless they have the key*
6. *But, the key is in a volcano (ie the burn address 0x0000)*
7. *And the Bank is still used by other happy “customers” with completely different Safes*

# What’s with the #1 wallet on Solana?

The #1 wallet is the $JESUS Bridge smart contract.

Solana Bridge: jkwgDqMBMYH2FP5LmTDGxEFVRKfQrpn1eeN7Q1Zk8yp

All of the available JESUS/SOL tokens that can be bridged from ETH are locked in that contract. It is impossible to redeem (or unlock) more tokens than are locked in the bridge (on either side).

# What’s the difference between JESUS/ETH and JESUS/SOL?

There is no difference. They are the same token, just on two different blockchains. Tokens can be bridged back and forth between the chains without restriction and liquidity is locked on both chains.

JESUS/SOL trades out of the Raydium liquidity pool.

JESUS/ETH trades out of the UniSwap V2 liquidity pool.

# Will JESUS ever be on other blockchains? (Base, BTC, XRP, etc)

Since JESUS is a decentralized ERC-20 token, it can be bridged to any chain, at any time, by anyone. However, To be traded on those chains, a new liquidity pool must be launched on the desired chain. Again, anyone can launch an LP on any chain.

# Will Jesus Coin ever be on any exchanges or futures platforms?

The listing process for major exchanges varies, most require a 5–6 figure listing fee, Market Maker, Liquidity, and minimum volume requirements.

$JESUS is available to trade on any decentralized exchange (UniSwap, Raydium, Jupiter, Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, etc).

# How does the Bridge work?

Blockchain bridges work in two ways:

1. *Mint & Burn*
2. *Unlock & Lock*

The JESUS Bridge utilizes the Unlock & Lock functions for bridging JESUS between Ethereum and Solana.

All of the available JESUS/SOL tokens are locked in a contract. When JESUS/ETH tokens are bridged over to Solana, those tokens are locked in a contract on the ETH side and the equivalent number of tokens are unlocked on the Sol side. Security wise this means, it is impossible to redeem (or unlock) more tokens than are locked in the bridge (on either side).

ETH bridge: 0x8BCCfed5d847087426cBCC787dAbA655DEe0D9A2

SOL bridge: jkwgDqMBMYH2FP5LmTDGxEFVRKfQrpn1eeN7Q1Zk8yp

# Is the $JESUS contract verified and audited?

Yes, the $JESUS contract is verified on Etherscan and was audited by MYTHX.

# Why are there security warnings on the contract?

JESUS launched with an antiwhale contract to help protect against bots/snipers. This is standard for most hyped contracts & was turned off before the contract was renounced.

Any “external call risks” and “anti-bot functions” are irrelevant after a contract is renounced because no internal/external functions can be called since the contract is owned by the burn address (0x0000).

# Why isn’t $JESUS verified on everywhere? (Jupiter, Phantom, Moonshot, etc)

Wallets and exchanges all have different verification requirements. Typically, volume and community interest are the aspects they factor in most. As $JESUS continues to grow, more platforms will verify the coin.

# Is it better to buy $JESUS on Ethereum or Solana?

Because the Solana liquidity pool has 99% less liquidity, slippage will be much higher there. While the JESUS/ETH LP can easily handle 5–7 figure buys/sells.

If gwei is high, buying on Solana might make more sense.

**What’s the trading volume of $JESUS?**

Since fees are less on Solana, SOL memecoins typically have much more volume than coins on Ethereum. $JESUS is an ETH native memecoin.

From 4/25/23 to 11/2/24, the average daily volume of $JESUS is: \~$1,000,000

# Why is the JESUS/SOL liquidity so different than the JESUS/ETH liquidity?

$JESUS launched on Ethereum on 4/25/23. At launch, 9 ETH + 1% of the supply was locked in liquidity. The UniSwap LP has accumulated over $1,000,000 in LP fees (from over $400,000,000 in total trading volume).

The JESUS/SOL Raydium liquidity pool was launched on 5/1/24, with \~$40,000 in JESUS and SOL (donations from the community). Both positions are locked and renounced and will continue to earn fees for perpetuity."

Uniswap (UNI) Surges Past $10 Billion Market Cap With More Room to Grow,Blockmandev,1h8yt79,2024-12-07 13:29:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1h8yt79/uniswap_uni_surges_past_10_billion_market_cap/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Uniswap (UNI) is flexing its muscles, skyrocketing over 80% in the past 30 days and smashing through a $10 billion market cap! Currently, UNI's Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 67, just shy of entering overbought territory. This suggests there’s still some steam left before the market may start cooling off.

While UNI’s Average Directional Index (ADX) has dipped slightly from 46 to 39, it remains well above 25, signaling the current uptrend is strong. If the momentum stays intact, UNI is eyeing the $17.39 resistance and could potentially soar to $20 – its highest level since 2021!

But here's the catch: if buyers lose pace, UNI might test support at $13.5, with a risk of dipping to $12.4 if things go south. Bulls, pay attention; the trend is still on your side, but the heat is rising.

Very Very Noob Post - I think I traded my ETH for my smart contract and it's gone - help please?,UniSwap,1h8oo3z,2024-12-07 04:06:25,4,0.75,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSwap/comments/1h8oo3z/very_very_noob_post_i_think_i_traded_my_eth_for/,biochemwhissan,Support Request,"I know this is gonna make the 99% of people roll their eyes reading this but -

As short of story as I can - I watched some youtube videos from millionaires living in dubai who have their little circles of millionaires collecting their 4 figure percent gains off small pool meme coins etc, and also spot future promising coins.

I got interested in XEROAI. 

I bought ETH and went to app.uniswap to get the token - thinking i would then be able to trade that token to my Trust Wallet (my Trust Wallet is all f'd up too - I set up currency wrong etc, it's there but displays incorrectly. I bought OCADAai but it was my first time 'importing' a crypto to my wallet and i stuffed up - even though I corrected it to the best of my knowledge - it doesnt display properly)

ANYWAYS 

Regardless of that - I bought the coin and it was there - and yay I'm happy and ready to HODL. Now here comes the eye roll - I have NFI what uniswap was / is - how it works, what a smart contract is / was etc. I noticed that I spent about 150 aud initially and THAT WASNT enough and I couldnt work out why - til I saw the network fee and was gobsmacked - but thought well must be there for a reason I'll just have to double up and add more , I'm determined to buy this coin.

  
Eventually I deposit enough FIAT into ETH to cover the trade and I bought my XEROAI - however I noticed I had about 60US$ worth of ETH left in my wallet on the desktop site. Not knowing what this was - I thought I stuffed up and only bought half or something and I decided to TRADE THIS to - what I believed to be, my COINTREE (australian exchange - its really bad IDK why I still use it, just been with them since 2017,) but the coins never showed up.

This is the transaction URL: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x355e898e5d559d696c06c3ff7677ecc3b61ec572c17966e6f9c43db88c40b47f](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x355e898e5d559d696c06c3ff7677ecc3b61ec572c17966e6f9c43db88c40b47f)

There's a SMALL chance I've sent it to the WRONG wallet, even though I opened up and copied and pasted my wallet address for ETH from Cointree to my FB messenger, so I could then log in and copy and paste it to make the transaction - I noticed the address was completely different to what I pasted. I double triple checked - but according to the link above - the address I sent it to was 0xC5842df170b8C8D09EB851A8D5DB3dfa00669E3F - which is the address for XEROAI

  
I swear to god I double checked, and my wallet address for the ETH it was MEANT to go to was: 0x656AC54A6168693e3bCEBf78039E9AA0e4279C2E

  
I dont know what I've done - are these funds gone forever? If so thats fine, but I need to learn something for the money I paid.

Does this look like a copy and paste error SOMEHOW - or is there something else about it? When I went to trade the ETH, UniSwap had a warning saying this looks like a wallet address, be aware you are trading a special type of crypto called a smart contract. I hit proceed anyways. Now its gone

  
Question 1 - Was this a copy and paste error by the looks of things? 

Question 2 - What did I actually do - did I trade my network fee which is somehow tied in a 'smart contract' to this XEROAI coin I bought? Does this now affect if I can buy or sell this coin anymore - or do I simply need to deposit more ETH when I want to get more or cash out? Or are those funds / XEROAI tokens now useless aswell?

Question 3 - Is it normal to have wallets all over the place for certain protocols ? Like do some wallets only handle certain types of tokens etc, and they do not have the actual ability to hold certain tokens because of some kind of factor? For example I have a TrustWallet just so I could deposit SOL to buy OCADA - I have funds somewhere only in the uniswap desktop site in a wallet sitting there somewhere - I have my 'exchange' wallets like BitGet (best exchange going around - buy their tokens now people are only just starting to realise how good this exchange is) and my cointree wallet - which is super basic and not recommended to anyone and is just for plebs like me and I only use / used  it because when I was younger it was the easiest way to buy BTC to buy naughty things in my naughty days in Aus.

  
Thanks for your help."
"Ether Surges Above $4,000 as U.S. Institutional Interest Grows",cryptoddler,1h8o4h8,2024-12-07 03:25:20,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1h8o4h8/ether_surges_above_4000_as_us_institutional/,Actual_Ad_5440,,"Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has broken the $4,000 threshold for the first time since March, rising 2.4% in the last 24 hours and 8.4% over the past week. The rally comes amid record inflows into ether spot exchange-traded funds and increased on-chain activity.

As of Friday, ETH is trading at $4,033, just 2% shy of a new 2024 high and 20% below its all-time high of $4,868. The ETH/BTC ratio has also recovered to 0.04, marking its strongest level since late 2022.

A growing Coinbase premium—where ETH trades higher on Coinbase than on Binance—signals strong demand from U.S. institutional and retail investors. This trend aligns with a spike in Ethereum network activity, as active addresses surged from 368,000 to 523,000 since late September, according to Glassnode. Increased on-chain activity drives ether scarcity through its token burn mechanism, adding upward pressure on prices.

While ether outperformed the broader market, the CoinDesk 20 index fell 1.4%, with laggards like stellar (XLM) and litecoin (LTC) dropping over 3%. In contrast, tokens like Uniswap (UNI) and render token (RDNR) posted double-digit gains, signaling mixed performance in altcoins."

# Why is it called Jesus Coin?

The founder chose the name Jesus Coin because he is a born-again, spirit-filled Christian, who loves Jesus. When creating the project, the goal was to have a catchy name that represented Biblical values (Justice, Generosity, Truth, Hope, and Love) to stand in contrast from the typical worldly values found in crypto (greed, deception, hate, and anger).

As Christians, we are called to live like Jesus and commit every part of our lives to him. Jesus Coin is a subtle reminder to keep our focus on him even amidst “worldly things”.

Do you love money more or Jesus Christ? *“Where our treasure is, that’s where our heart is also.” (Matt 6:21)*

# What does $JESUS mean?

A “$” (cash tag) is a hashtag on Twitter specifically for tweets that involve stocks & crypto. The “$” was added to the logo and branding as a way to differentiate Jesus Coin from other non-crypto projects and help archive and sort posts from the community on Twitter and other social media platforms. Crypto “tickers” are the short-form version of a coin represented in code on the blockchain. The ticker “JESUS” is thought-provoking and bold and stands out compared to other tokens and coins.

# Why is Jesus wearing sunglasses?

As Christians, we are called to go out into the world and spread the gospel. That means meeting people where they are and in ways, they relate to and connect with.

Jesus with sunglasses is merely a means to spread the Gospel in a modern way. (And it’s a great conversation starter.)

Adding the sunglasses to images of Jesus is a fun way to remind us that:

1. *Jesus is alive and speaking today.* [*(1 Pet 1:3)*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+1%3A3&version=NIV)
2. *The Bible is culturally relevant to our Modern times* [*(Matt 5:13–16)*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A13-16&version=NIV)
3. *Jesus laughed, had fun, and liked to party.* [*(Luke 7:34)*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A34&version=NIV)
4. *Most importantly, Jesus was notorious for stirring up the pot and challenging religious norms.* [*(Matt 5:17–20)*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-20&version=ESV)

The pixelated sunglasses (MLG glasses or meme shades) are a popular internet meme from 2010 called “thug life” where the glasses are photoshopped onto a counter-cultural character who displays independence and confidence.



# Is Jesus Coin a joke? Are you making fun of Jesus / Christians?

The mission of Jesus Coin is to influence culture and be a light in dark places. It is a decentralized, faith-based crypto that inspires people to love one another, seek a higher calling, and Do Good & Give More. The heart behind this project is to glorify God and spread the Gospel. Full-stop.

Crypto, Finance, and tech are notoriously worldly and anti-Jesus industries. But that doesn’t mean He can’t be there. The Bible says that God’s character never changes. ([Mal 3:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=malachi+3%3A6&version=NIV))

Within this beautiful tension, is an opportunity to speak to the Culture around us using the language and devices they understand (memes, crypto, social media). But to do that, we have to go into the world and “dine with sinners”. (Matt 9:10–13)

# Is it sacrilegious to make Jesus a meme?

Nowhere in the scripture does it say a visual representation of Jesus/God/Holy Spirit is: blasphemous, sacrilegious, making an idol, immoral, or a sin. At the heart of all Jesus Coin memes is to spread the Good News of the Gospel in a fun and engaging way.

For thousands of years, artists have been inspired by Biblical characters and scenes to create masterpieces. The Biblical justification for creating memes using images of Jesus comes from the following verses:

>

As long as it’s biblically accurate, doesn’t present any false doctrine or mislead others (or cause them to sin), using contemporary images to represent Jesus can be a meaningful way for people (of all ages) to remember the Good News of the Gospel in a context they understand. Christians don’t worship just an image or a name; they worship Jesus Christ the Son of God, the savior of the world.

The Holy Spirit speaks through every generation’s cultural language, and today, images, memes, and videos are one of the primary forms of communication (specifically with the youth).

In regards to the Jesus Coin logo: The Head of Christ painting By Warner Sallman is one of the most famous images of Jesus having been reproduced over 1 billion times. Adding the meme shades to it creates a transformative work to stir up conversation and dialogue around religion and culture.

# What makes $JESUS different than other coins?

Jesus Coin is the first faith-based crypto (the anti-meme coin). It is a Mission coin that stands for biblical values in a very worldly industry committed to Doing Good and Giving More in Jesus’ name. It was launched without a team supply as a protest against all the scams, rug pulls, and dishonest crypto projects and is community-run and managed.

**It was built on three tenets:**

1. *Fellowship: Community gatherings that are full of positivity and love*
2. *Discipleship: Mentoring and supporting members of the community with similar values*
3. *Stewardship: Encouraging holders to be generous with their time and resources*

Through these tenets, community members and holders seek to radically change the entire crypto ecosystem from within.

# Is Jesus coin blasphemous?

Jesus flipped the tables in the synagogue because they turned his father’s house into a den of robbers — ie greedy and dishonest merchants were scamming people. He boldly challenged religious and cultural customs and was extremely polarizing at the time (and even now).

Jesus Coin was created to remind believers to be generous, to help others, and to be good stewards of the resources God gives — with no expectations or promises.

Believers are called to be in the world but not of the world, ([John 17: 13–14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+17%3A13-14&version=ESV)) so having a Christian crypto (Jesus Coin) makes perfect sense to reach the next generation of believers and beyond.

**Here are some comments we’ve heard in the past:**

*“You don’t need a crypto to spread the gospel.”*

Correct. But crypto is an industry that deserves to hear the gospel. A powerful way to win people for Christ is through relatable testimonies — and the Jesus Coin community is full of other crypto natives sharing their experiences and testimonies with others about God’s miraculous works.

*“Crypto is a scam.”*

The blockchain is an immutable ledger that forever archives activities and transactions. Any perceived “value” is built on trust and provenance. Jesus Coin is an ERC-20 token that is decentralized and owned by its holders. The UniSwap V2 liquidity pool has over $1,000,000 in locked and renounced liquidity, ensuring that $JESUS is unruggable, can be traded in perpetuity, and will exist as long as Ethereum has validators.

*“Gambling is a sin.”*

The Bible does not outright condone gambling. However, greed, covetousness, and poor stewardship are widely discussed. Stewardship means being responsible with our resources and not falling into greed or laziness when it comes to our money.

Crypto is a digital asset that is known to be extremely volatile, which attracts speculation. Although there are risks in crypto, there are also many opportunities. With wisdom, prayer, education, self-control, and proper stewardship, individuals can make their own decisions about crypto and memecoins.

*“This is an idol because — “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”*

*“You shouldn’t mix God and money.” “Don’t serve mammon.”*

Jesus Christ of Nazareth is Lord. Not a crypto, or money, or technology, or a man.

1. *The Bible mentions money more than any other topic.*
2. *The Bible says that everything we have comes from him (James 1:17; 1 Cor 12:1–11)*
3. *And God very explicitly calls us to be good stewards (Matt 25:14–30)*
4. *The Bible calls us to be generous (Deut 8:18; 2 Cor 9:10–11)*

*” This is the mark of the beast.”*

Jesus Coin is a decentralized memecoin. There are no buy or sell taxes. There is no team supply. There are no expectations, requirements, or restrictions for anyone (of any religion or background) to interact with. The contract and liquidity are renounced. It is 100% community owned. It is a group of believers working to spread the Gospel through crypto and social media.

At the end of the day, only God can judge the project, the community, and the heart. (1 Sam 16:7).
