The Binance Effect Revisited: 2023 Edition. How far can coins go after being listed on Binance?,CryptoCurrency,15pekyt,2023-08-12 16:23:29,10,0.92,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15pekyt/the_binance_effect_revisited_2023_edition_how_far/,Qptimised,ANALYSIS,"So, I was inspired by a previous post of mine that delved into the effect of coin listings on Binance towards the price of that particular coin. Admittedly, the dataset that I used was not recent enough and not representative enough of the current economic climate. Therefore, I collected my own dataset this time round and did some simple analysis on them and wanted to share it with you guys.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial analyst and this is definitely not financial advice.*

# The Binance Effect

If you missed my previous post on the Binance Effect on MOONs, it is basically a phenomenon that happens to the price of a particular coin when it is listed on Binance (mainly for spot trading). In my previous analysis, the [dataset](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/06/binance-effect-means-41-price-spike-for-newly-listed-tokens/) was from mid 2021 to end of 2022 and consisted of 26 coins. I have now replicated the same analysis but for listings from Jan 2023 until now. Hopefully, this will give us a better idea of the price action that we can expect from MOONs listing on Binance during this economic climate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Dataset for 12 coins listed on Binance.](https://preview.redd.it/q2dpvlecnqhb1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=03c4ccd37f198cbf3956ec0de27ef2eb3bb6e6f1)

# Method for Analysis

First things first, Binance has listed a total of 12 coins from Jan 2023 until now. Notable ones include Worldcoin (WLD), Arkham (ARKM), Pepe (PEPE), Arbitrum (ARB) etc. The data in the table above has been extracted from CoinGecko and coin listings were taken from Binance Listing Announcement site. For the purpose of this analysis, I took the price at the launch date of these coins from CoinGecko and also the peak price of these coins (from Binance listing date until today; the total time period of these coins may vary depending on how long they have been listed for). Then, I took the percentage change in price and how long it took for these coins to reach their peak. 

&#x200B;

# Results

&#x200B;

|Coin|Price at Listing vs Price at Peak  (%)|Day of Peak after Listing|Price at Listing vs Price Today (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Worldcoin (WLD)|\+43.09|1|\-6.38|
|Arkham (ARKM)|\+14.37|1|\-37.06|
|Maverick Protocol (MAV)|\+4.70|2|\-47.05|
|Floki (FLOKI)|\+0.45|1|\-35.08|
|Pepe (PEPE)|\+1.66|49|\-27.07|
|Sui (SUI)|0.00|1|\-56.57|
|Radiant Capital (RNDT)|\+61.09|17|\-2.39|
|Arbitrum (ARB)|\+25.19|25|\-14.07|
|Liquity (LQTY)|\+33.78|14|\-57.11|
|Synapse (SYN)|\+29.27|2|\-55.12|
|Gains Network (GNS)|\+36.72|2|\-36.33|
|Rocket Pool (RPL)|\+83.76|90|\-14.90|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. Most coins listed have their peak on Day 1 & 2 after being listed on Binance.
2. The range of percentage price change between listing and peak goes from **0 to +83.76%,** with **the average price change being +27.84%.** For coins with 0% change in price, they had no increase in price and continued to fall in price until now.
3. It's important to note that all coins are down in price from the day it was listed on Binance vs today.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

It was kinda fun making this analysis. Obviously, I made this analysis to show the extent of the Binance effect in these uncertain times and hope this can be a good guide for navigating coin listings on Binance. But I have to admit, I did it mostly for MOONs. However, as always in crypto, nobody knows shit about anything. MOONs could go parabolic 10,000% right after being listed or only a mere 27.84%. There are also many factors in play like Reddit IPO, removal of the award system, Reddit Exchange etc. that are coming up in these next few months. It will be interesting to see how far MOONs can moon. I remain extremely bullish for MOONs."

What Is Liquity? And Why is it Gaining Momentum - Ratings & Analysis,TokenInsight,11moa7v,2023-03-09 04:54:25,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokenInsight/comments/11moa7v/what_is_liquity_and_why_is_it_gaining_momentum/,tokeninsight,,">Since $UST crash, some CeFi giants exit the crypto market due to centralization problems. The view that ""the future is decentralized"" has gradually deepened into the hearts of investors. Liquity, as one of the most decentralized stablecoins, has gained market attention. In this article, we will use TokenInsight's rating model to take a look at Liquity and provide an in-depth analysis of its current development status.

## What is Liquity?

[Liquity](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/liquity/overview) is a lending platform, as well as a [stablecoin](https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies?tag=Stablecoins) issuance platform. The protocol was launched on [Ethereum](https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies?tag=Ethereum) on April 5th, 2021, and currently operates exclusively on the Ethereum network. Liquity has two native assets: a USD-pegged stablecoin called [$LUSD](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/liquity-usd/overview), and a utility & governance token called [$LQTY](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/liquity/overview).On Liquity, users can deposit [$ETH](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/ethereum/overview) as collateral to borrow $LUSD, with a minimum collateral ratio of 110%. It means borrowing $100 worth of $LUSD requires at least $110 worth of $ETH as collateral. Compared to other over-collateralized stablecoins, Liquity has several notable features:

* It only supports $ETH as collateral and operates exclusively on the Ethereum network.
* Although Liquity's borrowing interest rate is floating, its borrowing fee is settled upfront and does not accumulate over time, which is more cost-efficient for long-term borrowers.
* Liquity is completely supported by smart contracts and operates independently. It is immutable once deployed, and even the development team does not has the management permission.

## What Is TokenInsight's Rating for Liquity?

TokenInsight has rated Liquity's current performance with a ***BB*** and a positive outlook. The competitors of Liquity include [Maker (A)](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/makerdao/overview), [Frax Share (BBB)](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/frax-share/overview), etc.The breakdown of the rating results is scored as follows.

* Underlying Technology & Security 68.85%
* Token Economics 60.8%
* Roadmap & Progress 56.67%
* Ecosystem Development 51.55%
* Token Performance 49.73%
* Team, Partners & Investors 66.73%

https://preview.redd.it/tuvexyt4roma1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=64d1cb6d4bec33da592d4d3b8b8ea87508404564

## Underlying Technology & Security (68.85%)

Liquity has adopted a multi-layered risk management mechanism to manage risks. Firstly, Liquity uses the total collateral ratio of the protocol to measure the overall risk level. If the collateral ratio of the entire protocol is greater than 150%, it is considered low risk, and if it is below 150%, it is considered high risk.

* When the protocol is in a low-risk state, users only need to maintain a collateral ratio of greater than 110% to avoid liquidation. 
* However, when the protocol is in a high-risk state, there is a risk of liquidation for positions with a collateral ratio below 150%. Meanwhile, users can only open a new position with a collateral ratio of greater than 150% until the protocol returns to a low-risk state.

Secondly, Liquity's liquidation mechanism consists of two layers.

* The first layer is the Stability Pool, where users deposit $LUSD as liquidation funds.  If liquidation occurs, the protocol uses the $LUSD in the pool to repay the loan, and depositors receive the collateral and liquidation rewards as compensation. Depositors can withdraw their funds at any time, except when there are liquidatable positions in the market.
* When the Stability Pool is drained, a debt redistribution mechanism is triggered. The protocol sorts the positions by risk from high to low and then allocates the loans and collateral of high-risk positions to low-risk positions one by one. **(Check out more in the example below.)** Although the overall risk of the protocol remains unchanged, the overall ability of positions to meet their obligations increases. Except for the account that was divided, other users and the protocol itself will be benefit.

https://preview.redd.it/n0wcr9b6roma1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5af2ba0d68900d1379e02a17937316f986a6c137

Furthermore, [Liquity is heavily reliant on smart contracts](https://github.com/liquity/dev) to manage its operations, and the development team has no control over the contracts. With a goal to increase decentralization and minimize human intervention, the protocol doesn't host its own user interface, instead, relying on third-party platforms. However, the current situation is less than ideal because each platform has different features and designs, leading to a less-than-optimal user experience.Moreover, since Liquity is managed by smart contracts, the code's security is of utmost importance. [The protocol's contract code has been audited by two institutions](https://docs.liquity.org/documentation/resources) (Trail of Bits and Coinspect) in 2021, covering a wide range of the source code. However, the reports uncovered some risks found that had not been addressed. As of writing, there haven't been any security incidents involving Liquity's contracts.

## Token Economics (60.8%)

Liquity has two tokens: $LUSD and $LQTY. $LUSD is a stablecoin that is backed by overcollateralized $ETH, and users can deposit it into the Stability Pool to earn liquidation fees and $LQTY rewards. In addition, $LUSD has a stability mechanism called ""Redemption."" Redemption allows any holder of $LUSD (regardless of whether they have an open position) to redeem $ETH at a rate of 1 $LUSD for 1 USD worth of $ETH. The riskiest position will be redeemed first. Since $LUSD is inherently equal to $1, its price will eventually converge to $1, and borrowers would not suffer any actual loss. However, the base interest rate of the protocol increases with each redemption, resulting in higher borrowing costs and redemption fees. This helps to avoid large-scale redemptions, meanwhile, reduce the circulation of $LUSD to drop its price. However, $LUSD is more volatile than other stablecoins.üì∑$LQTY was issued when the platform was launched in April 2021. The original vision of Liquity was a governance-free platform completely controlled by smart contracts. $LQTY was created without any governance rights, and its main use was to allow users to earn a share of the protocol's revenue, which includes borrowing and redemption fees. However, in January 2023, Liquity introduced a new community governance program called [LiquiFrens](https://www.liquity.org/blog/introducing-liquifrens-a-new-liquity-community-program), which gives $LQTY holders voting rights. The program is currently being trialed for three months.The initial distribution of $LQTY had a total supply of 100,000,000 tokens, with 56.6% allocated to investors, the team, and advisors. The team and advisors' tokens are gradually unlocked over 3.25 years, while investor tokens are locked for one year. However, there are no further details provided about the investor tokens' detailed lockup period.

## Roadmap & Progress (56.67%)

Liquity doesn't have a specific roadmap for its development, but the team releases progress reports in a quarterly basis. According to the 2022Q4 report, the team intends to further enhance the liquidity of $LUSD on Arbitrum. Moreover, the monthly proposals of the protocol will also contribute to the project development. Details on these proposals can be found on the [Liquity Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/liquifrens.eth).Currently, the total $LUSD supply is around 230 million, with a TVL of approximately 600 million, and the platform's total collateral rate is 259.9% (as of March 3rd, 2023, source: Dune and DefiLlama). Although the overall supply of $LUSD has decreased over the past year, the amount of positions (Troves) has been steadily increasing since June 2022 and is almost back to early 2021 levels. However, most Troves are small positions ranging from 10-100 $ETH, and only 7 have 10k-100k $ETH.As for $LQTY, the current circulating supply is 91 million, and 53.43 million $LQTY is staked, which accounts for approximately 58.72%. The amount of staked $LQTY has been steadily increasing since April 2022, but there has been a slight decrease of 99,011.84 $LQTY in the staked amount due to a recent price increase as of today compared to the 27th. The annual percentage yield (APR) for $LUSD in the Stabilization Pool is 5.74%, while for $LQTY staking, it is 0.76%.üì∑

## Ecosystem Development (51.55%)

As of March 2023, Liquity has listed 20 frontends on its official website (64 according to Dune), of which [Liquity.App](https://liquity.app/) has the highest number of active users.

##### 

https://preview.redd.it/q4xxwc0croma1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d9fe3089bee9c978f5c2e29dfb3611ca300e29

##### As disclosed in Liquity's report, the project is now mainly focused on expanding the $LUSD ecosystem through Chicken Bond, Layer2, and Lending.

* Chicken Bond is a yield protocol built on the top of Liquity, which provide $LUSD depositors with higher yield than the Stability Pool. Users' yield is mainly generated from the auto-compouned revenue and partially from LP revenue of Curve's $LUSD Pool. Currently, Chicken Bond's TVL is $20.64m, of which $6.38m comes from $LUSD deposited by users.
* [Layer 2](https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies?tag=Layer-2): Liquity is contributed to increase $LUSD's liquidity on Layer2 networks, including [Optimism](https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies?tag=Optimism) and [Arbitrum](https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies?tag=Arbitrum).
* [Lending](https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies?tag=Lending): Liquity has integrated other lending protocols such as [Aave](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/aave/overview) and [Euler](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/euler/overview) to enable users to lend/borrow $LUSD.

https://preview.redd.it/7bplyz5droma1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=35cae294e2f322461cc7bfd62f8863be26cef601

As shown in the figure above, except for the Stability Pool, most of $LUSD is distributed on Curve, Uniswap, Layer2 and other lending protocols. Generally, the utilization of $LUSD is not diversified as $DAI. According to statistics from DefiLlama, the current total market value of stablecoins on OP is $656.9m, with $USDC accounting for 54.97% and $LUSD accounting for only 0.89%.

## Token Performance (49.73%)

The following chart displays the price fluctuations of $LQTY over the last 90 days. The data indicates that the price of $LQTY gains this February in the [$BUSD reserve storm](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/binance-acknowledges-past-flaws-in-management-of-stablecoin-s-reserves) and the growing popularity of decentralized stablecoins.. From February 1st to 27th, the price of $LQTY rose from $0.711 to $1.278. On February 28th, the coin was listed on Binance, causing its value to double once again. Currently the price remains around $2.2.

## Team, Partners & Investors (66.73%)

Liquity was founded by [Robert Lauko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-lauko/) and [Rick Pardoe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-pardoe-8a3503187/), and is currently led by CEO [Michael Svoboda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelsvoboda2/). Both founders have more than 5 years of experience in the blockchain industry.According to statistics, Liquity completed two rounds of financing totaling $8.4 million between 2020 and 2021. Its major investors include Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Alameda Research, IOSG Ventures, 1kx, and Tomahawk.VC.

## Closing Thoughts

Liquity's protocol is operated and supported by contracts, making it a highly decentralized platform. However, there is room for improvement in terms of user experience, as there is no standardized frontend.In terms of mechanics, Liquity only supports one type of collateral and charges a one-time borrowing fee. This might help it stands out from other overcollateralized stablecoins. However, the price stability of $LUSD is not as optimal as that of other stablecoins, although this may provide greater arbitrage opportunities.Currently, compared to other stablecoins, the ecosystem of $LUSD is less diversified and the utility of $LQTY is relatively limited. But notably, the stake rates of both $LUSD and $LQTY remains high (more than 50%), which might be a positive indication.Overall, although Liquity has not suffered nay security issues related to its smart contracts and the platform has been operating stably, the ecosystem is currently weak and token use cases are not yet diverse enough. However, considering the increasing popularity of decentralized stablecoins, Liquity might has more development opportunities in the future.

Why 90% tokens drop 95%,CryptoCurrency,x7ched,2022-09-06 10:47:47,11,0.79,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/x7ched/why_90_tokens_drop_95/,yehoshzl,ANALYSIS,"# Why token prices¬†drop

Most crypto projects‚Äô tokens drop 90%+ within two years of launching. Why? It‚Äôs the supply and demand! Isn‚Äôt that why prices drop everywhere? Too much supply, not enough demand?

True, but in this article we‚Äôre going to dive deeper into how tokens allocated to insiders consistently prove to be the bane for web3 projects‚Äô token prices.

Like clockwork, when the vesting period for insiders ends, supply floods the market, demand doesn‚Äôt catch up and token prices slump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ngmahab239m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ebaab2af20a4c1812195c9b675f2503f8758a2

## Vesting and the supply/demand imbalance

Treating token vesting like startup equity vesting has become common practice among web3 projects and DAOs. Unfortunately, [treating tokens like startup equity is a mistake](https://designingtokenomics.com/the-complete-tokenomics-primer/articles/tokens-startup-equity). They are very different mechanisms, with different liquidity profiles and ‚Äò[jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)‚Äô.

The contradiction is simple: startup equity works because it‚Äôs locked up and aligns incentives for the long term. Tokens are liquid and therefore don‚Äôt align incentives for the long term. They can be sold, traded, or staked years before the project or DAO has reached maturity. Let‚Äôs see how you can analyze a project to avoid a 90% drop in a token.

## Token distribution: to whom, when and how¬†much

The first step is analyzing whom is owed how much of a token, and when they‚Äôll vest. Essentially you need to understand the distribution. Here is an example one of the better DeFi projects out there: [Liquity Protocol](https://docs.liquity.org/).

>Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against Ether used as collateral.

Liquity launched with a hard cap of 100 million $LQTY tokens. Here's the initial distribution:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yw57jaq439m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7002597f800eb80c17c27ec62f9bfcaf6f43bb6d

57.6% of tokens are allocated to insiders including the team and investors. 41.4% is allocated to the community, 1% to service providers. The top line sounds decent, with 41.4% going to the community. While some DeFi projects assign more to their community and less. to the insiders, that‚Äôs better than most startups for sure.

But you need to dive deeper to get the tokenomics understood properly. The community block is divided into two. 8.1% of tokens are allocated to the community reserve and endowment. These allocations are under the control of the Liquity team‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe don‚Äôt know when or for what they‚Äôll be spent. They could be spent all at once on a big marketing initiative or held in escrow for years. That‚Äôs a large supply overhang we have to deal with.

33.3% of $LQTY is allocated to the community on an algorithmic basis, using the same algorithm that Bitcoin uses, where issuance is halved. In the case of LQTY, halving events occur every six months instead of four years. This also sounds good‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinflation will drop much faster than in the case of Bitcoin, which means that LQTY holders will be diluted less. But there‚Äôs a catch.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nh0t2sh839m91.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=2222bda7d2eae611141f674f9160d18447d8bff2

While 33.3% sounds like a lot of the supply that we can forecast properly, it pales in comparison to the 57.6% of tokens that insiders control. To get a full picture of the supply coming online, we have to look at the insider vesting schedule.

## Insider vesting schedules

Liquity is a transparent protocol, so fortunately, we can find all the details for the vesting in their documentation.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7drcgxmb39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=41e4c2970973fb399db0c387c6e73ab06503c9e9

The 57.6% allocated to insiders have two very different lockup schedules. The team receives a quarter of its 23.7% after 12 months, and thereafter 1/36 each month. The investors on the other hand receive ***all their tokens*** after 12 months.

Unlike in startups, both parties can immediately sell or stake their tokens after 12 months. This is completely different than the classic use of ‚Äòvesting‚Äô in startups, where the equity is *earned* during the vesting period but never *liquid*.

Indeed, this dramatic difference in meaning and usage between web3 and startup equity leads to a huge increase exactly one year after the LQTY launch when a quarter of the teams ownership is unlocked and the entire investor stake is unlocked. With devastating repercussions for the price and retail holders of $LQTY.

&#x200B;

[üì∑LQTY issuance schedule](https://preview.redd.it/0m3xcske39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06b0df367349ab95dd64f734984dec1ddc8b1c2)

&#x200B;

Calculating token supply and¬†demand

Let‚Äôs analyze the supply and demand dynamics for $LQTY from launch through the first year and a half of the protocol.

## Analyzing the first¬†year

Let‚Äôs start with analyzing supply. During the first 12 months of Liquity‚Äôs existence. $LQTY is supplied and circulated on the market through three distribution mechanisms:

1. LQTY community rewards for the stability pool: This is 32% of the total token supply, which is distributed to people who provide a core function of the protocol. The distribution follows a six month halving schedule, so during the first 12 months 12 million LQTY are distributed
2. 1.3 million LQTY is distributed during the first six weeks to liquidity providers on DEXs
3. 2 million LQTY is earmarked for the community reserve and can be distributed.

This brings us to a to a maximum circulating supply of 15.5 million LQTY during the first year of the protocol.

What‚Äôs behind the demand for LQTY? As I laid out [here](https://designingtokenomics.com/the-complete-tokenomics-primer/articles/tokenomics-101-demand-part-2), demand comes from four things:

1. Token Utility
2. Memes
3. ROI
4. Governance

Liquity protocol is immutable, with no governance, so let‚Äôs scratch that off the list. Memes and a strong narrative haven‚Äôt quite coalesced around $LUSD, the core functionality of the protocol (although it‚Äôs starting to as $LUSD is arguably the only truly decentralized stable coin left). Which leaves us with token utility and ROI.

The utility LQTY grants is a revenue share of the Liquity Protocol. That‚Äôs the only utility it gives, and so in this case ROI and utility are one and the same. So what ROI was it granting during the first 12 months?

[üì∑Dune analytics by u\/dani](https://preview.redd.it/utju8xvh39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=655411f72a00c8c277110ed3120b95e34c936e65)

During the first 12 months, protocol revenue was \~$24 million. Since that revenue is distributed to LQTY stakers, there‚Äôs a clear connection between how many stakers are out there and the ROI. With 15.5 LQTY in circulation, assuming everyone stakes, that‚Äôs an annual distribution of $1.5. That yield served as a demand floor for the token.

And while LQTY traded together with all of DeFi and crypto and took a large tumble, throughout most of 2021, it found a decent floor around the \~$5 mark. But what happened when month 13 came around and supply hit the market?

&#x200B;

[üì∑LQTY price: May 2021 - April 2022](https://preview.redd.it/tq32l7jk39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=48980e342e80cfb3de0fe45546e55e76429ba900)

## 

# The supply-demand imbalance

When May 2022 hits, a lot of supply comes into the market. All of investors, advisors and the community endowment funds are now unlocked, as well as a quarter of the teams‚Äô $LQTY. Together that‚Äôs: 5,916,158 + 33,902,679 + 6,063,988 + 1,035,367 = 46,918,192 million tokens that hit the market all at once during month 13.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/omy74kdn39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d569d4467a5667f8cfe829dbd9bf1db4a4703a99

On day 365 of the project we had 15.5 million tokens in circulation. On day 366 we‚Äôve 3x that. ***Tokens in circulation have grown 300% in one day.*** On the other side of the equation, demand hasn‚Äôt grown nearly at that pace. Protocol revenue has barely budged from \~$24m. This causes a huge mismatch between supply and demand.

&#x200B;

[üì∑Dune analytics by u\/dani](https://preview.redd.it/hx2hf77p39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=089f58f4446cd01a70c9d5288960b5b161245e97)

What DeFi has going for it which shouldn‚Äôt be taken for granted, is its transparency. Due to the Liquity team being completely transparent, it‚Äôs possible for retail token holders to see the supply dump coming, and indeed selling of $LQTY started early in 2022 and picked up steam during April, right before the supply unlock.

&#x200B;

[üì∑Liquity price January 2022 - August 2022](https://preview.redd.it/wgetnaks39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3d55389e11128f46c93dfe1a39e465517980ec)

If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äúgreat! all the tokens are unlocked, the market has priced it in‚Äù, it‚Äôs not so simple. Most of the tokens that got unlocked didn‚Äôt get sold on the market‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinvestors aren‚Äôt that stupid‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand preferred to wait for better prices. So where did those tokens go? Into the LQTY staking pool. The LQTY staking pool grew 3x from May through August‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin line with the growth of circulating tokens.

&#x200B;

[üì∑Dune analytics by u\/dani](https://preview.redd.it/na6wcs3v39m91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7afb05e317aaae8e8e82d80c64554397797cd84d)

Unfortunately, this has a huge, dampening affect on the price of $LQTY as the same amount of protocol revenue is now being distributed to 45 million tokens, instead of 15 million ones. This means that the yield and ROI has been reduced dramatically. Giving buyers less of a reason to buy the LQTY token.

## Why token prices drop¬†90%

While all crypto tokens trade with a very high correlation, as time goes by, the wheat will separate from the chaff and good tokenomics will be critical for project success.

The tokenomics of the Liquity protocol never accounted properly for the supply and demand imbalance that would occur exactly one year after the the token launched, and the results are easily foreseen. A 300% increase in token supply can never be covered by the growth in the protocol use. Only the best of the best startups achieve that kind of year over year growth. The mismatch in supply and demand floods the market with liquidity and inevitably, the token price drops. Worse, the supply overhang will take years to be worked out of the market.

While Liquity Protocol is a fantastic protocol and product, the tokenomics doomed the price and adoption of $LQTY from day 1, and it will take a long time for the protocol to shake off the repercussions.

In August, we continued to add new leveraged yield farming pools to our platform. On top of that, we also improved Automated Vaults by introducing the [repurchasing strategy](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/automated-vaults-improvement-plan-f8ee048f9de2) which is currently piloted on the [**n3x-BNBBUSD-PCS1**](https://app.alpacafinance.org/vault/n3x-bnbbusd-pcs1) vault. We also added another Grazing Range partner, boosting yield for those who staked ALPACA in our Governance Vault. Alpaca Finance has also climbed in the the DeFi TVL ranking at [DeFillama](https://defillama.com/) to the 20th rank (from 26th last month).

&#x200B;

We published our first Institutional Newsletters where you can read the summary of major headlines in the crypto market related to regulations, products, and funding. The newsletters will be published weekly. You can check out the first two editions, [Edition 1](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/alpaca-finance-institutional-newsletter-1-4906a7b8a406) and [Edition 2](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/alpaca-finance-institutional-newsletter-2-a2545cc24f71), which were released in August.

The [Alpaca Gaming Q&A Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcasvY5j9P8&t=5s) now includes subtitles for 18 languages.

Read below for the details of our developments this month.

# üåæNew Lending Pools and Farms

In August, we added two new farms to the platform:

* STKBNB-BNB (4x, PancakeSwapV2, BNB Chain) earning 37%+ APY
* pSTAKE-BUSD (2x, PancakeSwapV2, BNB Chain) earning 389%+ APY

With this recent Grazing Range partnership, leveraged yield farmers on the two new pools will be able to earn an additional **\~200k USD in PSTAKE bonus rewards which will be distributed at the end of the eight-week campaign period.** You can read more details [here](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/grazing-range-pool-55-welcome-pstake-to-the-herd-2a0f1e675b14).

We will continue to add new farms with our existing DEX partners (PancakeSwap, MDEX, BiSwap, SpookySwap) and future ones too.

# üè¶ Automated Vaults

In August, we started piloting a major improvement on the Automated Vaults by introducing Asset Repurchasing. Normally, the vault will have to swap the token through DEXs (e.g. Pancakeswap, Biswap) which will incur a price impact and 0.25% swapping fees. Now, with repurchases, AV investors will benefit from lower swap fees, no price impact on large swaps, and more frequent rebalancing. The repurchaser who swaps the vault‚Äôs assets can benefit by doing an arbitrage strategy ‚Äî i.e., buying an asset from the AV(with less than 0.25% swap fess) and selling on CEXs.

We are currently piloting the repurchase method on the **Market Neutral BNB-BUSD PancakeSwap (**[**n3x-BNBBUSD-PCS1**](https://app.alpacafinance.org/vault/n3x-bnbbusd-pcs1)**) vault.** This particular pool‚Äôs performance will be monitored closely, and once the new method has been verified to work as expected, we will roll out the implementation to other remaining vaults. You can read more [here](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/automated-vaults-improvement-plan-f8ee048f9de2).

# üî• ALPACA Buyback&Burn

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lxfwmjycrjl91.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e27ce5a7584b625e7e7b66b091ec45a2ca69ba3)

Each week, we share our revenue and ALPACA buyback & burn statistics on Twitter. In August, a total of **1,445,552 ALPACA (\~$385,000)** was burned over 4 weeks, or an average of 361,388 ALPACA per week. The total cumulative burn is now \~**25.5 million ALPACA (13.6% of total supply).**

ALPACA has been deflationary for 35 of the last 42 weeks. We hope to again refer our readers to [this article](https://medium.com/leverage-farming-with-alpaca/value-of-alpaca-tokens-568c4540341c) by a community member, explaining ALPACA‚Äôs deflationary nature and how it will lead to a natural rise of the ALPACA token‚Äôs price over time.

# üóΩ Alpaca Governance

Any user can stake ALPACA in the Governance Vault to (1)earn a share of our platform‚Äôs revenue, (2) earn ALPACA emission rewards, (3)get Grazing Range rewards, (4)receive xALPACA to vote on Alpaca Improvement Proposals (AIPs), and (5)have private access to high leverage (>4x) Automated Vaults. Currently, users can earn **22.8% APY** on the BNB Chain and **23.6% APY** on Fantom.

In total, **51.1% of circulating ALPACA has been locked** (up from 49.3% last month), and we have paid over **>$2.9 Mn** to ALPACA governance stakers. Read all about Alpaca Governance in our [Part 1](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/announcing-the-launch-of-alpaca-governance-vault-higher-apys-for-alpaca-holders-36f2bb38a20d) and [Part 2](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/governance-vault-part-2-is-here-early-withdrawal-governance-insurance-plan-ee5c4c6356eb) Medium articles or visit our docs‚Äô [Governance section](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/governance/governance-vault).

Our Discord now has a [private channel](https://t.co/zHWJZl3hyx) for xALPACA holders where governance members can discuss topics and discover/share alpha. There is a bot automating membership and the minimum required to gain entry is 100 xALPACA in a wallet.

**Grazing Ranges:** Users who stake ALPACA in our Governance Vault can earn Grazing Range tokens. Grazing Range tokens are tokens of protocols we have partnered with (bold indicates new partners this month):

* 23,300 PSR (\~$90k USD; from 6/30 to 8/25)
* 55,550 HIGH (\~$90k USD; from 7/28 to 9/22)
* **980,000 PSTAKE (\~$200k USD; from 8/11 to 10/6)**

Users who stake at least 500/5000/50,000 xALPACA (3 tiers) during the **first 4 weeks** of a Grazing Range campaign can earn a Grazing Range NFT. In August, the [**HIGH (Ext.2) NFT**](https://galaxy.eco/alpacafinance/campaign/GChtSUtPub) became claimable on Project Galaxy. Details of each Grazing Range campaign are available on our [Medium](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance).

Liquity Coin Overview,cryptologi_st,vu7mat,2022-07-08 06:30:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptologi_st/comments/vu7mat/liquity_coin_overview/,Cryptologi_st,,"Liquity is a decentralized protocol, which enables Ether holders to obtain maximum liquidity against their collateral without paying interest. This protocol offers interest-free collateralized borrowing and DeFi lending. Liquity has seen a surge in usage because of the top-performing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms of 2021. This decentralized borrowing protocol allows users to draw 0% interest loans against ETH which is used as collateral. LUSD (a USD pegged stablecoin) is the coin that is used to pay out the loans, and a minimum collateral ratio of only 110% is needed to maintain for this payment. [Lets have a tour around Liquity here !](https://www.cryptologi.st/news/Is-Liquity-(LQTY)-A-Good-Investment-In-2022?utm_source=social&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=content)"
Top 100 highest % from ATH in the coingecko top 500 coins,CryptoCurrency,v5btca,2022-06-05 07:54:53,15,0.71,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v5btca/top_100_highest_from_ath_in_the_coingecko_top_500/,lexwolfe,METRICS,"as a follow up to this [recent post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v4c83w/top_100_sorted_by_from_all_time_high/), I present this table of the 100 highest percentage from all time high in the coingecko top 500. I got this information from the coingecko API which is super easy to use and doesn't require membership for basic queries [https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)

Age is an estimate from the oldest year of ath and atl. There's not an age field otherwise.MCR = Market cap rank

I wonder if there's a way to create a meaningful ""score"" from % from ath and days from ath.

Differences between stablecoins by collateral,ethereum,uqwtcv,2022-05-16 10:08:04,68,0.91,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/uqwtcv/differences_between_stablecoins_by_collateral/,romanmazur,,"At Wido, we tried to look at the differences between stablecoins as of May 1st, approximately 1 week before UST crashed.

Stablecoins achieve price stability through collateralisation. There are different types of collateral (cash or other crypto assets), let‚Äôs explore it for a few stablecoins ‚Äì USDC, UST, DAI, FRAX and LUSD.

# USDC

https://preview.redd.it/gnkmj6lpguz81.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=135b652023acbfd2ae857786db7a890bc7d98662

In the chart above, USDC stands out of the crew. As of May 1, 2022, there was 49B USDC issued, fully backed by US dollars.

Let‚Äôs zoom in to better see the rest of the picture. We will purposefully keep UST for the end.

&#x200B;

# DAI

https://preview.redd.it/lw3syd8wguz81.png?width=1682&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9fcae6ab654c1c267848dd12ef0d2f654a2045

DAI is an over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by various types of crypto collateral, most notably ETH, WBTC and USDC, as well as real-world assets such as real estate.

As of May 1, 2022, there was \~ **8.46 billion** DAI in circulation backed by approximately **$13.14 billion** worth of collateral, most notably $5.96 billion worth of ETH and 4.37 billion USDC, resulting in a collateralization ratio of **155%**.

Notably, as of May 1, 2022, there also was $1.29B worth of MKR (protocol market cap) that serves as a backstop to protect the dollar peg.

# FRAX

https://preview.redd.it/qav35quzguz81.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=7786b153fc5c6e354f1fad2bc470d05df1f6503f

FRAX is an algorithmic stablecoin, partially backed by USDC stable-coin and FXS (Frax Share Token).

As of May 1, 2022, there was **2.7 billion** FRAX in circulation and the protocol‚Äôs collateralization ratio was sitting at **86.75%**, which equals approximately **$2.34 billion** in USDC collateral.

There also was $1.41B worth of FXS serving as a backstop to protect the dollar peg.

# Liquity USD

https://preview.redd.it/mlht39p8huz81.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ade3a073d278bd4c00d9dc2578891437740efc

Liquity USD is an over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by ETH.

As of May 1, 2022, there was **479 million** LUSD in circulation, backed by 364 thousand ETH worth approximately **$997 million**, resulting in a collateralization ratio of **208%**.

Note: For Liquity, as per their docs, the LQTY token does not serve as a back-stopping mechanism.

&#x200B;

# UST

https://preview.redd.it/xa1vbzcdhuz81.png?width=1682&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9ff9c3125824012d822550276d5f69becc1d51

In the case of UST, as of May 1, 2022, there was 18.56B of UST total issued.

LFG collateral worth $1B consisted mostly of BTC. On top of that, there was $27.15B worth of Luna, which served as the backstop mechanism.

So when you receive ETH from the pool it's not a reward, it's an asset you purchased.  Koinly does not recognize Liquity protocol and I don't see a way to sort out these transactions myself.  The ETH is not ""Rewards"", they are purchased assets, they shouldn't be taxed.  

Does anyone know if there's a way to properly tag Liquity Stability Pool ETH output so it's not taxed?  Also the amount of LUSD staked won't match up with what was put in the pool because some of it is used to buy the liquidated ETH...  so I'm sure that's a problem as well.

LQTY Stable Coin | Solving Maker's DAI Problem and No Governance,CryptoMarkets,spgirv,2022-02-10 15:41:42,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/spgirv/lqty_stable_coin_solving_makers_dai_problem_and/,economicsdesign,DISCUSSION," We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice. 

**TLDR**:As a debt protocol, Liquity's goal is naturally to expand the demand for $LUSD. When the demand for $LUSD increases, the protocol revenue earned from mint and redeem activities will also be larger.$LUSD is an over-collateralised stablecoin with a minimum collateralised ratio of 110%, but the actual collateralisation of the system is around 250%. Liquity is one of a number of recent prominent lending projects. After more than 2 months of development, the project has achieved many notable achievements. $LUSD is currently the 8th largest market capitalisation stablecoin according to Coingecko's statistics. However, $LUSD's DeFi integrations and use cases are very limited.

# General Conclusion

Liquity is a decentralised borrowing protocol similar to the Maker DAO. In the Liquity protocol, users lock collateral to open collateralised debt positions (CDPs, in Liquity called troves). The system then lends the user $LUSD from the system - a stablecoin pegged to $1.The two main and essential components of the project are $LUSD ‚Äî stablecoin and $LQTY ‚Äî revenue token:

* $LUSD is a stablecoin that is collateralised only by $ETH and is kept stable at peg 1 $LUSD = 1 $USD.
* Liquity ($LQTY) is the project's utility token, only used for staking and earning protocol revenue generated during borrowing and redeeming $LUSD.

# Classifying Stablecoins

We look at them in four different ways:

1. Mechanism
2. Peg
3. Collateral amount
4. Collateral type

# About $LUSD

It uses two mechanisms, a dual-token and a reserve. It's soft pegged to USD and the collateral amount is over-collateralised. It uses just $ETH as collateral type.

# Dual-Token Model

There are two tokens in the system, $LUSD, which is a stablecoin soft pegged to USD and the other one is $LQTY which is not a governance token but purely a value accrual token. When we talk about value accrual there is a liquidation fee that is generated from the system. The $LQTY holders will be receiving this liquidation fee which is the profits from the system. You hold $LUSD when you want to be using it, creating it, and paying people in it and you hold $LQTY when you want to receive accrual from the system.

# Reserves

Reserves are over-collateralised. Ideally, it is 150% over-collateralised, but the entire system is 200% over-collateralised. The lower bound or the lowest amount that can be over-collateralised is 110% and below that you'll be liquidated. It uses $ETH as collateral."
