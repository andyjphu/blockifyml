Staking Explained in Simple Terms: What It Is and How Beginners Can Earn,u_Ok_Note8852,1hvp53e,2025-01-07 06:11:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Note8852/comments/1hvp53e/staking_explained_in_simple_terms_what_it_is_and/,Ok_Note8852,,"In traditional finance, a popular way to earn passive income is by keeping money in bank deposits or low-risk investments in bonds. This approach helps grow capital and generate stable returns in the long term. Digital asset holders do not have access to these options, but they can earn through staking — a mechanism that allows users to earn rewards by contributing to the security of a given network.

In this article, we will explain what staking is, how it works, the advantages it can offer investors, and the risks involved.

# What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm that powers blockchain operations, transaction verification, and network protection from malicious actors. It was designed as a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW), where network security is ensured by computational power. In PoS, tokens become the main resource for participating in consensus. Participants lock their assets to become validators, and the network selects those who will verify transactions and add new blocks. The chances of becoming a validator depend on the number of locked tokens, as well as other factors such as staking duration and randomness.

To ensure validator loyalty, PoS uses a penalty mechanism known as ""slashing."" If a network participant violates the rules, their assets can be partially or fully confiscated.

Due to these features, Proof-of-Stake has become a key element of modern blockchains, offering an energy-efficient solution for maintaining consensus and making participation accessible to any token holder. Staking is at the core of PoS.

# What is Native Staking?

Native staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency directly in a blockchain to support its operation and earn rewards. Participants in native staking can also become validators, helping verify transactions, create new blocks, and maintain network security. To participate in native staking, a special wallet and a minimum number of tokens are usually required, depending on the blockchain's requirements.

However, locking assets for staking does not automatically grant validator status. Validators must also launch their own nodes, so for users who cannot or do not want to do this, the option to delegate their tokens is available. They transfer assets to one of the validators via specialized platforms and receive a portion of their reward.

# Liquid Staking and Restaking

Modern approaches to utilizing tokens to support blockchains, in addition to native staking, include two key trends: liquid staking and restaking. These expand the possibilities of using staked assets, making the process more flexible and profitable.

Liquid staking allows users to lock their assets to support the network in exchange for liquid tokens that represent their staked assets. These tokens can be used in DeFi protocols for earning, trading, or investing. Thus, liquid staking solves the issue of asset freezing that is typical of traditional staking. Restaking is a mechanism that allows users to reuse assets already locked in staking. It is applied to secure additional networks or protocols.

For example, in the EigenLayer project, Ethereum validators can offer their staked tokens to secure new decentralized applications, cross-chain bridges, or oracles. In return, they earn additional rewards.

However, restaking also carries higher risks: validators may face penalties if they violate the rules of the additional protocols, potentially losing assets.

# Staking vs. Farming and Mining

Staking, farming, and mining are three different approaches to earning in the crypto industry, with distinct goals, requirements, and risks. However, beginners often confuse them, perceiving them as similar methods of earning passive income through digital assets.

It's important to remember that staking is considered a more eco-friendly solution for securing a blockchain compared to mining. In both cases, users can actively participate in the network, but mining requires powerful hardware that consumes a significant amount of electricity. In PoS networks, validators only need to lock their tokens to help secure the network.

Farming (or yield farming) has a different nature but often involves ""staking,"" i.e., locking assets. In this case, users freeze their tokens in smart contracts to provide liquidity to decentralized protocols, such as exchanges or lending platforms.

Rewards from farming are often paid in governance tokens or transaction fees. Unlike staking, farming is not related to network security. Instead, it is used to provide liquidity or other functions in DeFi. However, farming carries additional risks, including impermanent loss, which occurs when the prices of assets locked in pools fluctuate.

This comparison helps understand which method is best suited for a user's specific goals.

# Advantages and Risks of Staking

**Main Benefits of Staking:**

* **Passive income:** Locked tokens continue to work for their owner, earning rewards without requiring active involvement. This makes staking especially attractive for long-term investors.
* **Network support:** Through staking, users help ensure the security and stability of the blockchain, becoming an integral part of its ecosystem.
* **Accessibility:** Staking does not require expensive equipment. All that is needed is cryptocurrency and the appropriate software.

**Risks and Drawbacks of Staking:**

* **Market volatility:** The value of tokens can drop sharply, leading to losses that may outweigh the earned rewards.
* **Technical risks:** Assets may be lost due to errors in smart contracts, hacking attacks, or loss of access to a wallet. These risks increase when using intermediary providers.
* **Inaccessibility of tokens:** Locked assets cannot be used, limiting liquidity and the ability to sell quickly. Liquid staking platforms are an exception.
* **Slashing risk:** In case of errors or malicious actions by the validator, part of the staked assets may be confiscated as a penalty. This can apply both to the user and to the validator they delegated their assets to.

Many of these risks can be minimized with a careful approach, such as choosing reliable providers or delegating assets to trustworthy validators with a good reputation and high reward shares. It's also important to monitor the state of the crypto market and the price dynamics of the selected asset.

# Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Staking

The key metric when choosing a network and platform for staking is APY (Annual Percentage Yield), which reflects the annual return considering reward reinvestment. It’s important to balance rewards, network reliability, and asset volatility.

Here is a list of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies for staking as of this article’s writing, according to Staking Rewards.

1. **Ethereum (ETH):** The largest PoS blockchain with $132.4 billion locked in staking. The network offers an APY of 3.48%.
2. **Solana (SOL):** Known for high transaction speeds and low fees. $91.2 billion locked, with an APY of 6.65%.
3. **Sui (SUI):** A next-gen blockchain quickly gaining popularity. $33 billion locked, with an APY of 2.81%.
4. **Cardano (ADA):** One of the earliest and most stable PoS networks. $26 billion locked, with an APY of 2.67%.
5. **Binance Coin (BNB):** Native token of Binance Smart Chain. $21.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.22%.
6. **Tron (TRX):** One of the oldest blockchains with staking. $13 billion locked, with an APY of 4.65%.
7. **Aptos (APT):** A rapidly developing network competing with Sui. $12.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.00%.
8. **Avalanche (AVAX):** A popular ecosystem with high transaction speeds. $12.41 billion locked, with an APY of 7.79%.
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** A blockchain with unique architecture supporting parachains. $8.65 billion locked, with an APY of 11.96%.
10. **Celestia (TIA):** A modular blockchain launched in 2023. $6.12 billion locked, with an APY of 10.69%.

These projects offer unique opportunities for users wishing to earn through staking due to varying reward parameters and use cases.

# Best Staking Platforms

The choice of a provider depends on the supported assets, reliability, and user preferences.

Below is a list of the largest staking providers with a brief description and statistics on the amount of locked capital (TVL) and the number of stakers. Data is from StakingReward and is accurate as of the article’s writing.

1. **Ether.fi:** A decentralized platform for Ethereum staking. TVL: $22.7 billion, stakers: 260K.
2. **Kiln:** A corporate-level platform for Ethereum and other PoS assets. TVL: $10.7 billion, stakers: 97K.
3. **P2P.org:** A professional staking provider supporting networks like Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. TVL: $10 billion, stakers: 90K.
4. **Allnodes:** A hosting and staking platform supporting multiple blockchains. TVL: $6.56 billion, stakers: 308K.
5. **Consensys Staking:** A solution from Consensys for Ethereum staking. TVL: $3.47 billion, stakers: 28K.
6. **Stakin:** A professional staking provider supporting various PoS networks. TVL: $3.26 billion, stakers: 71K.
7. **Staking Facilities:** A German provider for institutional PoS networks. TVL: $3.17 billion, stakers: 22K.

These platforms offer a wide range of staking solutions, catering to both institutional and retail users. The supported networks allow every investor to find their balance between returns and risk.

# Conclusion

Staking is a way to earn passive income and actively participate in supporting blockchain operations. Its popularity is explained by energy efficiency compared to mining, ease of participation, and the potential for stable rewards.

However, participating in the network’s infrastructure requires understanding technical processes and associated risks. For beginners, staking can offer an easy and accessible way to earn, provided they use providers that lower the entry barrier and technical complexities. It's crucial to carefully choose platforms and projects to minimize potential threats.

With innovations like liquid staking and restaking, users have even more tools to manage their assets flexibly. These solutions make the process more convenient and appealing for both experienced investors and newcomers eager to integrate into the crypto ecosystem."

Long story short, around the time of Everfree last year I embarked on an upgrade project for TIA, which derailed, and the update that was supposed to follow Everfree (and the OnlineCon, and then Ciderfest) got stuck in the logjam. But with VPE the only tournament left to go before the Invitational is set to start, it's critical that we have up-to-date standings available. So here they are, long overdue:

Commentary will be a bit hard since so much has happened since the last update, with decks rising and falling thanks to the Canterlogic ban. But it's Combo and Control that rise to fill the void at the top of the board. The top three are the only survivors from the main contenders at Everfree, though because the Magic Combo wasn't played there I suspect that its true rating should be higher than it is here.

The Canterlogic ban wasn't that big of a deal in Harmony, as that format hadn't gone so wholesale onto the card as Core did. These two events did bring a couple of new entrances to the top of the list though, most excitingly in the form of Istagrem's Taxes list. I'm very happy to give a Mono-White deck some time in the sunlight.

# Invitational Pts/News

Planning for the Invitational is in full swing that 2025 is just over the horizon. Any tournaments held at VPE will the **last** events to award Invitational points prior to the start of the tournament. Therefore, the list as you'll see it below is pretty close to what it will look like in the main tournament.

I will be contacting invitees in the week following VPE, so if you're one of the names in **bold** (or *italicized*) on the below list (indicating that if we were to cut it today you would be an invitee), now would be a good time to start considering your availability over the next few months. More details on the schedule and format for the tournament this year will be coming in the first few weeks of January.

Celestia (TIA) - Navigating Through Recent Market Dynamics and Technological Innovations  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into the recent surge of Celestia (TIA), a modular blockchain project that has captured significant market attention. We explore TIA's remarkable price performance, which has seen an 800% increase from its 2023 lows, driven by strategic airdrops, staking rewards, and a growing developer ecosystem. The paper examines how Celestia's unique approach to blockchain scalability through data availability sampling has positioned it as a leader in the modular blockchain narrative, enhancing its integration with Ethereum's layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. We analyze the impact of community engagement, particularly the rush to stake TIA for airdrop benefits, and its effects on market liquidity and trading volumes. Additionally, the analysis covers market mechanics, including short liquidations and long position accumulations, offering insights into TIA's market sentiment. Through this multifaceted exploration, we provide a comprehensive understanding of Celestia's current market standing, technological advancements, and future investment potential.

Solana weil es der bekannteste coin von der Liste ist? Oder vielleicht CSPR weil der 0,01€ kostet und man wöchentlich tausende neue coins hat? 
Vielleicht den Polkadot Onkel Kusama oder Cosmos?"

$2 Billion Token Unlock Event in October 2024,ChicksX,1gdboig,2024-10-27 10:04:42,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicksX/comments/1gdboig/2_billion_token_unlock_event_in_october_2024/,ChicksX,,"The crypto market is bracing for a significant event as **$2 billion** worth of tokens will be unlocked by the end of October. Projects like **Celestia**, **Aptos**, **Axie Infinity**, and **Arbitrum** are set to release a substantial amount of tokens into circulation, which could have a notable impact on the market.

# Key Details:

* **Celestia (TIA)** will unlock **$1.1 billion** worth of tokens, representing the majority of the October unlocks.
* Other notable projects, such as **Aptos, Axie Infinity, and Arbitrum**, will release an additional **$600 million** worth of tokens combined.

# What Does This Mean for Investors?

1. **Increased Liquidity**: As these tokens enter circulation, liquidity for these assets will improve, making them easier to trade. This could be beneficial for long-term investors or those looking to enter the market at more stable prices.
2. **Potential Selling Pressure**: With such large token unlocks, early investors, project developers, or insiders may take the opportunity to sell their vested tokens, leading to short-term **price drops**. This is particularly true if the market doesn’t have enough demand to absorb the newly unlocked tokens.
3. **Volatility**: The sudden increase in token supply can result in heightened **market volatility**, creating opportunities for traders to capitalize on price swings. Expect fluctuations in the price of these tokens, especially in the days following their release.
4. **Market Sentiment**: These token unlock events can also be an indicator of investor confidence. If the market absorbs the unlocked tokens without significant sell-offs, it could signal positive sentiment. However, if many holders dump their tokens, it may reflect broader concerns about the project's future.

# Project Highlight: Celestia

Celestia is unlocking **$1.1 billion** in tokens, which represents a significant portion of its total supply. Celestia is a modular data availability network designed to make it easier for developers to launch their own blockchains. With such a large release, it’s essential to monitor how the market reacts, as this could have implications for the project’s future success and its standing in the broader crypto ecosystem."

Unpopular Opinion: I like Twilight’s Final Design.,mylittlepony,1g1mw7u,2024-10-11 19:18:06,1471,0.97,119,https://i.redd.it/byajm010n7ud1.jpeg,ObscureDolphinPotato,:discussion: Discussion,"I’m an artist, and I’ve always loved parallel theming, storytelling, and design. There seems to be a popular opinion that Twilight’s ‘full princess design’ isn’t fitting. I think it’s really pretty, cool, and nice. It fits the ending where everything comes full circle, and helps really cement that Twilight is the all powerful ruler of equestria.

I think that it comes off as unfitting to people because they’re not used to seeing Twilight that way, and the change came as a shock.

Similarly, people didn’t like Twilight turning into an alicorn in the first place because they weren’t used to the idea, and thought it was unnecessary. Her design changed to become more barrel-chested after her transformation, and it took a lot of people a while to get used to her looking that way.

This design change is more drastic (as it uses celestia’s model) and only lasts a single episode, which may explain why people dislike it so much. We associate the design with Tia. Additionally, the more I think about it, the more I feel like the design could have been worked on for a bit longer. The flowing hair (while fitting, and though I love it) can come off as a bit too much like a re-skin. I think the tail is the worst offender of this.

Still, I adore the design. What do you think about it and why?"

2024 Crypto Bull Run: Altcoins with 10–30X Potential in Web3,2024CryptoBullRun,1fnmg2i,2024-09-23 10:56:39,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/2024CryptoBullRun/comments/1fnmg2i/2024_crypto_bull_run_altcoins_with_1030x/,Significant_Touch692,,"# While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to capture headlines, several emerging projects offer untapped potential for significant returns. This article delves into promising altcoins, including Mande Network, Akash Network, Osmosis, Celestia, Stellar, Cosmos (ATOM), SAGA, Solana, CUDOS, and Nolus, while addressing the limitations of DeFi and DePIN and emphasizing the lasting impact of blockchain technology.

# The Limitations of DeFi and DePIN

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) have gained traction as revolutionary concepts. However, their scalability and sustainability are often called into question. According to a report by Chainalysis, over $1 billion was lost to DeFi hacks in 2022, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in these ecosystems.

The lack of robust service level agreements (SLAs) in DeFi protocols can lead to unreliable performance, while the decentralized nature makes accountability a challenge. Without clear liability, these platforms risk undermining user trust and operational integrity.

# The Enduring Appeal of Crypto Technology

Despite the challenges facing DeFi and DePIN, the fundamental technology of blockchain remains promising. According to a report by McKinsey, the global blockchain market could reach $1.4 trillion by 2030. The potential for transparency, security, and decentralization can revolutionize sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics, driving the industry towards more sustainable and practical applications.

# Tokenization: Bridging the Gap Between Web2 and Web3

Tokenization represents a vital step in merging traditional finance (Web2) with blockchain innovations (Web3). By creating digital tokens for real-world assets — such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property — new markets can emerge, increasing efficiency and transparency.

One of the most promising applications is in credit scoring. Traditional credit scoring methods often exclude underserved populations. Blockchain-based credit scoring systems can provide a more comprehensive assessment, fostering financial inclusion.

# Altcoins with Potential: A Closer Look

The upcoming bull run is poised to be influenced by factors such as institutional adoption, favorable regulations, and increasing public interest. Here are several altcoins to watch closely:

# Mande Network: A Hidden Gem with Exceptional Potential

**Token Symbol:** MAND

Mande Network is carving out its niche as a peer-to-peer credit scoring layer two solution, aiming to be the credibility hub for real-world applications in Web3. The project’s focus on organic growth, transparent engagement, and a highly experienced team enhances its appeal. With a low fully diluted valuation (FDV) and minimal exchange sprawl, Mande Network stands out as a compelling investment opportunity. It has the potential for 10–50X returns as it bridges the gap between digital identity and real-world applications.

# Osmosis: A Decentralized Exchange with Potential

**Token Symbol:** OSMO

Osmosis operates as a decentralized exchange (DEX) within the Cosmos ecosystem. It enables liquidity aggregation and incentivized pools, attracting a strong community. With its innovative features, Osmosis is well-positioned to become a leading DEX. However, as the DEX landscape matures, returns may be capped around 5X.

# Celestia: A Modular Blockchain Infrastructure

**Token Symbol:** TIA

Celestia is designed to improve scalability by separating consensus from application execution. This modular approach allows various decentralized applications to thrive without sacrificing security. While Celestia shows promise, its returns may also hover around the 5X mark as it works to establish itself.

# Stellar: A Scalable Payment Network

**Token Symbol:** XLM

Stellar focuses on cross-border payments and financial inclusion, with low transaction fees and fast confirmation times. While it has the potential to disrupt traditional finance, its best growth days may be behind it, limiting returns to approximately 5X.

# Cosmos (ATOM): A Network of Interconnected Blockchains

**Token Symbol:** ATOM

Cosmos aims to create an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains, fostering interoperability. However, concerns about its centralized decision-making and lack of community engagement have diminished its once-strong allure. Many analysts believe that Cosmos has lost its magic, making significant price appreciation unlikely in the near future.

# Akash Network: A Decentralized Cloud Computing Platform

**Token Symbol:** AKT

Akash provides decentralized cloud computing services, leveraging GPU power to offer affordable resources. However, its reliance on the NVIDIA narrative and existing hardware limits its scalability. The long-term sustainability of this model raises doubts about its growth potential.

# SAGA: A Blockchain Platform for Gaming

**Token Symbol:** SAGA

SAGA focuses on the gaming sector, but it suffers from a lack of solid fundamentals. While it could present opportunities for short sellers, those looking for long-term investment may find more promising options elsewhere.

# Solana: A High-Performance Blockchain

**Token Symbol:** SOL

Solana has gained popularity for its high transaction speeds and low fees. However, it has faced numerous technical challenges and concerns over its long-term sustainability. Given the hype surrounding it, Solana is viewed as one of the riskier bets, with returns potentially limited to 5X.

# CUDOS: A Decentralized Computing Network

**Token Symbol:** CUDOS

CUDOS aims to provide affordable cloud services through a decentralized network. While it has potential, its scalability and performance have yet to be fully tested. Investors should approach with caution, expecting moderate returns.

# Nolus: A Blockchain Platform for Decentralized Applications

**Token Symbol:** NLS

Nolus focuses on decentralized applications but has faced stability issues, impacting user trust. The team’s intentions seem genuine, but the platform’s reliability remains questionable. If Nolus can regain user confidence, it could present a 10X opportunity, but this will require significant effort.

# The Limitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as industry leaders, but their potential for explosive growth is diminishing. The increasing institutional involvement, including ETFs and derivatives, has shifted these assets into a more regulated and less speculative realm. Analysts predict that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will see a maximum of 5X returns, particularly as regulatory frameworks tighten.

# The Decline of NFTs

NFTs, once the darling of the crypto world, appear to be losing traction. As interest wanes and fatigue sets in, many projects lack the substance needed for long-term viability. The NFT craze, largely driven by speculative hype during the COVID era, has resulted in declining enthusiasm and a search for more meaningful applications of blockchain technology.

# Conclusion

The next bull run in cryptocurrency is poised to be defined by altcoins that offer real-world applications and sustainable business models. Mande Network emerges as a standout opportunity, while other projects like Osmosis, Stellar, and Celestia show promise despite challenges. Investors should approach Bitcoin and Ethereum with caution, as their days of explosive growth seem behind them. As the industry evolves, the focus will likely shift towards practical solutions that bridge Web2 and Web3, paving the way for a more stable and prosperous crypto landscape.

Conduct thorough due diligence, assess the risks, and consider the transformative potential of these emerging technologies as you navigate the next phase of the cryptocurrency market."

If you appreciate this list and would consider redelegating some ATOM from your current validator to Blocks United, we’d be sincerely appreciative. You DO NOT have to unbond or unstake your tokens. It’s simple and only takes a minute. **Check our** [tutorial](https://blocksunited.com/redelegate-cosmos-atom-validators/)**.**

To access airdrop claim links please register for our [Cosmos Airdrop Email](https://blocksunited.com/cosmos-airdrops/?utm_source=Cosmos+airdrop+update+8-8-24&utm_medium=Reddit&utm_campaign=Cosmos+Airdrops). If you don’t see the email within a minute, check your spam folder.

You must use a Cosmos-native wallet, like Keplr or Leap to claim airdrops and manage those tokens. Atomic, Exodus and Trust wallet users, have no fear because we’ve got you covered in [this tutorial](https://blocksunited.com/how-to-import-exodus-atomic-and-trust-wallets-into-keplr/)!

We do our best to verify that all the information in this email is official and safe to click, but we can’t possibly know if a project turns out to be a scam. We are not smart contract or authz permission auditors, nor do we hold ourselves out to be.

**When claiming airdrops you will be prompted to “approve” the transaction. Be on the lookout for, “msgSend” and other authz permissions. Those are BAD. If you see anything other than “msgClaim” then we advise against approving the transaction. It’s best to wait and check social media channels to see if people are getting scammed.**

Always **D**o **Y**our **O**wn **R**esearch. Blocks United is not liable for any losses you incur. Always exercise extra caution with meme coins. It is wise to use two hardware wallets, one for savings that is never connected to websites and smart contracts. And, one for staking and interacting with DeFi applications. Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket.

If you’re not emotionally attached to your **ATOM** validator, we’d be honored to have you as a staking partner. You can find Blocks United in [**Keplr**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1c75bmp/stake_atom_using_keplr_extension_a_stepbystep/)**,** [**Cosmostation**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1c0o74s/stake_atom_using_cosmostation_a_stepbystep_guide/)**,** [**Leap wallet**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1cajwfz/stake_cosmos_atom_using_leap_extension_wallet/)**, Trust wallet, Ledger Live, Frontier, Rainbow and Guarda wallets.** We also run a validator node for Polygon’s **MATIC** token.

**\~LFG!\~**

**Mars Protocol (NEW INFO)**  
This is not an airdrop, but a public service announcement. Mars Protocol has migrated to Neutron and their original L1 is being deprecated. Therefore, MARS token holders must migrate their tokens over to Neutron. Note that staked MARS takes 14 days to unbond.

If you appreciate this list and would consider redelegating some ATOM from your current validator to Blocks United, we’d be sincerely appreciative. You DO NOT have to unbond or unstake your tokens. It’s simple and only takes a minute. **Check our** [**tutorial**](https://blocksunited.com/redelegate-cosmos-atom-validators/)**.**

Nothing we say is financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell anything. Cryptocurrency is a highly speculative asset class.

It has been quite a while now since these were last updated, though it's been a bit of an empty stretch outside of the changeover in the Core format. Since we've had a rotation now, this post will mark the end of the Core 3 numbers, and I have some statistics to share to commemorate the occasion. But first, the top-line numbers:

# Core 3 (SB -> FM)

1.

Note that these numbers have **not** been adjusted for the Shopkeep ban as the format rotation happened before that banlist adjustment took place.

This Core was a venerable format by the time that we finally got rid of it. In total, for the time that it was tracked, there were (numbers may be off a little bit, most of this is manually counted and tracked):

* 42 tournaments played
* 464 decks submitted to those tournaments
* 736 tournament games played

The following list ranks Mane Characters by the number of distinct decks that used them.

1. Captain Celaeno, Swashbuckler (18)
2. Grogar/Discord, Ruinous Ruse (17)
3. Fluttershy, Nurturing Nature (15)
4. Student Six, A Grade Above (14)
5. Thorax, The Changed Changeling (12)
6. Fluttershy, Growing Confidence (12)

Now let's have a look at some popular decks, ranked by the number of tournament games that featured them, (including archetypes that would eventually be banned):

1. Fluttershy, Stunning Wonder/Blue (Banned), 36-17 (53 games total)
2. Princess Cadance, Friends of the Family/Blue, 27-23 (50 games total)
3. Thorax, The Changed Changeling Mono, 27-21 (48 games total)
4. Princess Celestia, Royal Tutor/White Unicorns, 30-15 (45 games total)
5. Captain Celaeno, Swashbuckler/Mono, 16-21 (37 games total)
6. Grogar/Discord, Ruinous Ruse/Mono Farm, 14-19 (33 games total)
7. Student Six, A Grade Above/Multi Reanimator (Banned), 21-8 (29 games total)
8. Princess Skystar, Out of Her Shell/Multi Tricorns, 16-11 (27 games total)
9. Fluttershy, Nurturing Nature/Blue (Banned), 12-14 (26 games total)
10. Ocellus, Knowledge is Power/Yellow, 6-18 (24 games total)

Finally, here are the colour distributions across all of the Old Core Archetypes. The first percentage is how many of the decks used that colour as their primary colour, the second is how many used it as their secondary colour.

* Blue: 14.67% Primary, 16.3% Secondary
* Orange: 14.67% Primary, 9.78% Secondary
* Pink: 15.22% Primary, 15.22% Secondary
* Purple: 16.3% Primary, 10.87% Secondary
* White: 11.41% Primary, 13.59% Secondary
* Yellow: 23.37% Primary, 8.15% Secondary
* Multi/No clear choice: 4.35% Primary, 7.07% Secondary
* None: 0% Primary, 19.02% Secondary

# Invitational Info

There have been no changes to the Invitational point standings since the last update, as the Whinny City tournaments did not have enough participants and the HithCon event, while large enough, was playing a technically unofficial format (as NG had not been officially released yet).

The other big thing to announce about the Invitational is that the next event will be taking place starting in **January** of **2025**, not immediately following Everfree as it did last year. This was a scheduling change which was made early in 2024, when it seemed most likely that Continentals would take place at Ponyville Ciderfest. This new schedule has the extra benefit of not interfering with the American holiday season, which has tended to trip up the tournament in the past.

Points will thus continue to accumulate until Vanhoover Pony Expo 2025. Also, as mentioned in the most recent April TIA post, **Neighlander events will aware Invitational points** moving forward, most pertinently for the Everfree tournament this year.

Here are the current numbers, copied from the last post:

1. Grand Pause (20)
2. Bigcheese (18)
3. Tie (10)
   1. Tom
   2. Ivory Starlight
4. Minty Fresh (5)
5. Tie (3)
   1. Hithroc
   2. Anamoy
   3. Fizzban
   4. Kevin
6. Tie (2)
   1. Istagrem
   2. Aracat
7. Tie (1)
   1. NGnir
   2. Golden Note
   3. Cursedchords
   4. *Bugle – auto-invite*

*Whew. Lots to get through, but I wanted to have this up in time for Everfree, even if just barely, and to give Core 3.0 a bit of a send-off as well. The next update will likely be in September once the Everfree numbers are all out.*"

To protect its users Reddit doesn't allow us to post links to the projects below. To access airdrop claim links please register for our [Cosmos Airdrop Email](https://blocksunited.com/cosmos-airdrops/?utm_source=Cosmos+airdrop+update+8-8-24&utm_medium=Reddit&utm_campaign=Cosmos+Airdrops). If you don't see the email within a minute, check your spam folder.

You must use a Cosmos-native wallet, like Keplr or Leap to claim airdrops and manage those tokens. Atomic, Exodus and Trust wallet users, have no fear because we’ve got you covered in [this tutorial](https://blocksunited.com/how-to-import-exodus-atomic-and-trust-wallets-into-keplr/)!

We do our best to verify that all the information in this email is official and safe to click, but we can’t possibly know if a project turns out to be a scam. We are not smart contract or authz permission auditors, nor do we hold ourselves out to be.

**When claiming airdrops you will be prompted to “approve” the transaction. Be on the lookout for, “msgSend” and other authz permissions. Those are BAD. If you see anything other than “msgClaim” then we advise against approving the transaction. It’s best to wait and check social media channels to see if people are getting scammed.**

Always **D**o **Y**our **O**wn **R**esearch. Blocks United is not liable for any losses you incur. Always exercise extra caution with meme coins. It is wise to use two hardware wallets, one for savings that is never connected to websites and smart contracts. And, one for staking and interacting with DeFi applications. Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket.

**If you’re not emotionally attached to your** [ATOM](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1jmykcq8gylmy5tgqtel4xj4q62fdt49sl584xd) **validator, we’d be honored to have you as a staking partner. You can find Blocks United in Keplr, Cosmostation, Leap wallet, Trust wallet, Ledger Live, Frontier, Rainbow and Guarda wallets. We also run a validator node for Polygon’s** **MATIC token.**

**\~LFG!\~**

**~Aigisos (NEW INFO)~**  
**Project:** Aigisos is a rollup chain on Dymension and AIDX is their DEX that integrates AI trading.   
**Token symbol:** AIG  
**Available for:** DYM stakers, perpetual traders on their DEX, Gitcoin donors, earndrop contributors.  
**Snapshot:** July 23, 2024.  
**How to claim:** Claim by submitting your address in their Discord. No need to connect your wallet to anything. Details are on their Medium channel. It's a little tricky. You must type ""/"" in their aigisos-rolldrop Discord channel and when the command options appear, select ""/check."" Then in the box that pops up indicate whether your address is Ox or Dym. Then paste your Ox or Dym address in the second box that pops up.   
**How to stake:** We don't believe AIG can be staked yet.  



**~Stride (stTIA CLAIM NOW OPEN)~**  
**Project:** Stride is a liquid staking protocol built on Cosmos. Users can deposit their tokens to receive normal staking rewards and received stTOKENS in return. Those stTOKENS can then be used in liquidity pools to earn additional yield. Learn more on their blog and at [Stride.zone](https://www.stride.zone/).  
**Token symbol:** STRD  
**Available for:** Those who held stTIA   
**Snapshot:** February 1 through July 1, 2024.  
**How to claim:** Claim at stride dot zone  
**How to stake:** Stake STRD in-wallet. Consider our friends at u/AtlasStaking.  



**~Drop dot Money (NEW INFO AND CAN BE FARMED)~**  
**Project:** Drop is a liquid staking protocol on Celestia and started by the Lido team.   
**Token symbol:** DROP  
**Available for:** Those who farm by swapping ATOM into liquid dATOM and then providing liquidity on Astroport, Levana or Apollo. Bear in mind that Apollo and Astroport are experiencing issues since the Terra chain was hacked the week of July 29th. Learn more on X.  
**Snapshot:** Ongoing.  
**How to claim:** We don't know yet.  
**How to stake:** We don't know yet.

  
If you appreciate this list and would consider redelegating some ATOM from your current validator to Blocks United, we'd be sincerely appreciative. You DO NOT have to unbond or unstake your tokens. It's simple and only takes a minute. Check our blog for our redelegating tutorial.

Nothing we say is financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell anything. Cryptocurrency is a highly speculative asset class.

# Bitcoin Awaits U.S. Inflation Data and Bond Market Cues

The [cryptocurrency](https://www.iconomi.com/cryptocurrencies) market is on edge, anticipating the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC (8:30 ET). The CPI data is expected to show a 0.1% month-over-month increase for June, following a flat performance in May, with a year-over-year rise of 3.1%. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecasted to have risen by 0.2% month-over-month and 3.4% year-over-year. These figures will provide crucial insights into the inflationary trends in the world's largest economy and potentially influence the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy decisions.

The anticipated CPI report could bolster the likelihood of Fed rate cuts, a scenario that typically benefits risk assets like Bitcoin. Lower rates increase market liquidity, attracting investors to higher-yielding, riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, which has seen a recovery from its July 5 lows of around $53,500, faces resistance at the $59,000 mark. Market participants are keenly watching the CPI release, which could set the tone for Bitcoin's next move.

# Treasury Yield Curve and Bitcoin's Market Sentiment

The U.S. Treasury yield curve's reaction to the CPI data will also be critical for [Bitcoin's](https://www.iconomi.com/asset/BTC/USD) market sentiment. A soft CPI release could lead to lower yields on the two-year Treasury note as investors anticipate rate cuts, while the 10-year note yield might remain elevated due to concerns over potential budget deficits. This dynamic could result in a ""bull steepening"" of the yield curve, where the spread between the yields on the 10-year and two-year notes increases. Historically, periods of bull steepening have coincided with economic contractions and risk aversion, posing challenges for equities and cryptocurrencies.

The current political climate, including the increased odds of a Trump presidency, adds another layer of uncertainty, with potential implications for inflation and fiscal policies.

# Mt. Gox Repayments: Strategic Plays in BTC and BCH

In the midst of these macroeconomic factors, the cryptocurrency market is also navigating the ongoing Mt. Gox repayments. The defunct exchange is distributing substantial amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to creditors affected by the 2014 hack. The selling pressure on BCH is expected to be significantly higher compared to BTC, creating an opportunity for pair trading strategies.

# Bitcoin Technical Analysis: A Crucial Juncture

Bitcoin's technical landscape is presenting mixed signals. Currently trading at $57,700, Bitcoin has rebounded from last week's low of $53,600 but remains in a downtrend from its March high of $73,800. The Profit and Loss Index hovering around its 365-day moving average is a critical metric, as previous downside crossovers have heralded major market corrections. Additionally, the lack of growth in Tether's (USDT) market cap, often a driver of bull markets, suggests limited immediate upside potential.

[Source: TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/vr5dsgly03cd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3371942e42d742a36e960056b517738df27589d7)

Despite these bearish indicators, Bitcoin whales are accumulating at the fastest rate in over a year, with large holders increasing their stash by 6.3% over the past month. This accumulation trend is a bullish signal, indicating that major investors see value at current price levels. Furthermore, the cessation of aggressive selling by Germany, which had been liquidating seized BTC, removes a significant supply-side pressure from the market.

# Celestia's TIA Token: A Market Phenomenon

Celestia's TIA token has recently surged by 25% to $7.30, making it the top performer among the top 100 digital assets by market value. This rally has caught traders off guard, as funding rates in TIA perpetual futures remain negative, indicating a strong bias for short positions. This scepticism could lead to a short squeeze, driving prices higher as traders are forced to cover their bearish bets.

Celestia's role as a data availability layer for layer 2 networks like Orderly Network is a fundamental driver behind the token's recent performance. The network's ability to provide scalable and secure data storage solutions for decentralised applications underscores its growing significance in the blockchain ecosystem. The token's price momentum appears poised for further gains.

# Goldman Sachs Expands Crypto Offerings

  
Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch three tokenization projects by the end of the year, reflecting increased demand from investors. This move signals a broader acceptance and integration of digital assets within traditional financial institutions. Goldman Sachs' digital assets global head, Mathew McDermott, emphasised that these initiatives are driven by investor interest and the transformative potential of tokenization.

The bank's renewed focus on crypto, including trading crypto derivatives and participating in the ETF markets, marks a significant shift. This expansion is contingent on regulatory developments, particularly post-election, which could unlock further opportunities for crypto-related products.

In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is at a pivotal point, influenced by macroeconomic data, technical indicators, and strategic developments within the industry. Bitcoin's next move will likely hinge on the upcoming CPI report, Treasury yield curve dynamics, and ongoing market-specific events like the Mt. Gox repayments and institutional adoption by entities like Goldman Sachs.

Celestia (TIA) is also among the gainers in today’s session, as seen from its price movements. An in-depth analysis shows that the supertrend is green, indicating an uptrend in the Celestia price.

On the other hand, looking at other indicators, we see that the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is positive, supporting the bullish trend. As of press time, Celestia traded at $6.96, representing a 13.2% increase over the last 24 hours.

Tokenomics: do they matter?,ethtrader,1dreair,2024-06-29 11:54:45,9,0.8,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1dreair/tokenomics_do_they_matter/,falk_lhoste,Discussion,"Hey guys 😊

I wanted to start a small discussion about tokenomics and their importance for a Crypto project. I'll share my opinion, and then hopefully read some of your points in the comment section. 

Personally I'd say that the **most important** thing by far is the product itself. You can have great tokenomics but if the product itself sucks good tokenomics likely won't safe you. Cardano for example has relatively good tokenomics, a nice staking mechanism but the project itself ain't good in my opinion. At least compared to the Ethereum dapps and plethora of neat options in DeFi. 

After the product itself, in the short term hype and narrative is the thing that matters most imo. I've seen it with Celestia and many low float high FDV projects. The market needs some time to catch up with bad tokenomics and hype/narratives can make people go completely nuts in the short term and even buy a thing that dumps 5% new supply on early investors every week. 

Finally, in the long run I think that tokenomics do matter and they matter a lot. I precisely didn't buy TIA at 20$ because of the terrible tokenomics and now that the hype phase has died down a bit the token corrected significantly. 

In synthesis my order of priorities goes like: 

Product 
Tokenomics (in the long term) & Hype (in the short term)

I like Ethereum a lot because of the product & the tokenomics and even though the hype ain't truly there right now it'll return. 

Let me know what you think 👇🏻"

Presenting the full and COMPLETE guide for Hyperlane - the third and FINAL interoperability chain to farm after Wormhole and LayerZero,ethtrader,1dlylx7,2024-06-22 11:47:06,5,0.7,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1dlylx7/presenting_the_full_and_complete_guide_for/,Every_Hunt_160,Original Content,"What's good fellow Ethtrader fam,

First, did you miss out on Wormhole?

Second, did you miss out on LayerZero?

If you felt FOMO from missing out, or you only got a Happy Meal allocation because you started late and the price tanked - I've got your back, because today I will share about HyperLane which is the third and only interoperability chain you can still farm today. 

I had made 2 earlier guides on EthTrader, but this is an all-in-one package you will see today - let's get into it.

**1) 1st priority : Bridging TIA on usenexus (https://www.usenexus.org/)** 

Usenexus is the flagship bridge for Hyperlane, similar to what Stargate is to LayerZero.

[1st wallet: Cosmos Wallet, 2nd wallet: EVM wallet](https://preview.redd.it/qgcyb7w9458d1.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=11f83abf724d807da117b86bdec3e72ab9e47267)

What you need: KEPLR wallet (for Cosmos chain, Celestia and Neutron Chain), and EVM wallet (Arbitrum/Manta blockchain)

**Please see the Step 1 to Step 4** on my earlier guide on the full steps to bridge TIA: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bxfpyz/hyperlane\_updated\_guide\_part\_2\_a\_comprehensive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bxfpyz/hyperlane_updated_guide_part_2_a_comprehensive/)

**2) 2nd priority :  Bridging INJ on usenexus or** [**bridge.inevm**](https://bridge.inevm.com/)

The bridging is the same wallets as above, you need 1) Cosmos wallet and 2) EVM wallet.

[Only 1 swap back and forth from Cosmos wallet \(Injective\) to EVM \(inEVM\)](https://preview.redd.it/zfvozy6w458d1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=2615711b96e650b897169ac1fca4e1b3e21ed852)

**Please see the Step 5 to Step 6** on my earlier guide on the full steps to bridge INJ  - this can be done after you bridge TIA, and do an Cosmos wallet conversion to swap Tia to INJ: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bxfpyz/hyperlane\_updated\_guide\_part\_2\_a\_comprehensive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bxfpyz/hyperlane_updated_guide_part_2_a_comprehensive/)

Alternatively, you can buy INJ on a CEX, and withdraw CEX to a Cosmos wallet and do the inj swap

**3) 3rd thing: The Triple Farm: Hitting Solana wallet - bridging ZBC from EVM wallet to Sol on** [https://www.nautilusbridge.com](https://www.nautilusbridge.com)

**Step 1: Buying ZBC on BSC**: Go to [pancakeswap.finance](http://pancakeswap.finance), connect to BSC chain and buy some ZBC:

[Just search 'ZBC' on Pancakeswap to buy ZEBEC](https://preview.redd.it/z0ev59wi558d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b76ed73e519442d2c00936826c76b9f8bf3732b)

Step 2: Go to  [https://www.nautilusbridge.com/](https://www.nautilusbridge.com/) , select token ZEBEC and bridge from BSC to Nautilus Chain

https://preview.redd.it/gqllk4xq558d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e6e52fdc1a63bc666ba471733958f25a94988e0

**Step 3: Connect your Solana wallet.** **Bridge from Nautilus to Sol**

https://preview.redd.it/rouqwv7z558d1.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=30adbb71267fe2b7889cbc281addaba8488b1288

**Step 4: Bridge from Solana, back to Nautilus to get your transaction in.** Congrats, at this stage you potentially have 3 different wallets qualifying for Hyperlane.

**4) 4th thing: Maximising chains on EVM : Bridging on minter.merkly**

https://preview.redd.it/ugmitr3l658d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ce96e0cbc66201c55cea20f8eccb58c90456b8b

Minter.merkly will only support your EVM wallet. 

Tip 1: Priority here would be Token Bridge, where you can push volume here. I'd still all 4 options at the top at least once but don't need to overpush for hNFT and HFT bridge.

Tip 2: Maximise your source and destination chains, especially source chains: for the more obscure chains **just try to hit one transaction (to or from)**:

For example, you can bridge $1 worth of Eth to Zeta and then make 1 transaction from Zeta on the bridge.

Rationale: Because for LayerZero they counted all your chains, very likely HyperLane will do the same and something that will boost your final score

https://preview.redd.it/0s3q1r98758d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4f76f10542a9a7ea8304cbaa82b30eb8864c23e

**5) 5th: The multiplier: Add TiaN- Eth liquidity on TraderJoe**

Almost every guide says to do this as a multiplier, and HyperLane team has apparently suggested this in the past. 

This will be an important step to do: See number 3 at my earlier guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1b77rnf/hyperlane\_farming\_guide\_what\_you\_need\_to\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1b77rnf/hyperlane_farming_guide_what_you_need_to_know/)

**6) 6th: The quests: Do the Hyperlane quests on layer3.xyz**

This is a new step, HyperLane launched an official questing campaign on Layer3, and I myself am getting started.

Complete all the quests, mint as many cubes as possible once you are done - the cubes themselves will be valuable for layer3 own rewards campaign.

[https:\/\/layer3.xyz\/](https://preview.redd.it/bqo5ev96858d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9769ca4403fbd0826358bcacf706617e204d7e4)

**Conclusion:**

**1) This is an all in one guide, don't complete all the steps at once - take 1 or even 2 months to do it.** 

I don't want to overwhelm you guys, just do 1 at a time and there's no rush because there's probably a few months to TGE.

**2) Important tip\* : For your Cosmos and Solana wallet, I recommend you make transactions at least once a month:** so your distinct number of months recorded on Hyperlane explorer (https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz/ ) can increase

Remember, it is a marathon and not a sprint. For more bonus tips you can look at my earlier guides, but I've covered everything I am doing and everything you really need to know - all the best!"
