What is a crypto sniper?,cryptoQandA,1i78cle,2025-01-22 05:41:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1i78cle/what_is_a_crypto_sniper/,Ujowo,,"## What Is a Crypto Sniper?

A **crypto sniper** refers to a tool, bot, or strategy used in cryptocurrency trading to execute rapid, highly timed transactions—often within seconds or milliseconds—of a token's launch, liquidity pool creation, or market event. The goal is to capitalize on price discrepancies, hype-driven volatility, or inefficiencies in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or automated market maker (AMM) platforms. The term ""sniper"" is metaphorical, likening the precision and speed of these actions to a military sniper's targeted shot.

### How Crypto Snipers Work

Crypto snipers operate by automating the process of buying or selling tokens at optimal moments, typically during critical market phases:

1. **Token Launches and Presales**  
   Snipers target tokens immediately after they are listed on DEXs like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, or SushiSwap. Bots monitor blockchain activity for new contract deployments or liquidity pool creations. Once a pool is live, the sniper executes a buy order before most retail traders can react, often securing tokens at the lowest possible price.

2. **Liquidity Pool Monitoring**  
   Liquidity pools on AMM platforms are critical for price discovery. Snipers track pool reserves and token prices in real time. When liquidity is added or removed, bots calculate arbitrage opportunities or front-run retail trades to profit from slippage or price spikes.

3. **Front-Running and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)**  
   Advanced snipers exploit MEV, a concept where bots reorder, insert, or censor transactions within a blockchain block. By paying higher gas fees, these bots ensure their transactions are prioritized by validators or miners. For example, a sniper might detect a large pending buy order, purchase the token first, and sell it back to the original buyer at a higher price—a practice called ""sandwich attacking.""

4. **Custom Scripts and APIs**  
   Snipers rely on custom-coded scripts, APIs, or pre-built bot software (e.g., Maestro, Banana Gun, or Unibot) to interact with blockchain nodes. These tools bypass manual trading interfaces, enabling sub-second transaction execution. Users often configure parameters like target token addresses, gas fees, and slippage tolerance.

### Key Features of Crypto Sniper Tools

- **Real-Time Blockchain Data**: Snipers integrate with blockchain nodes or third-party services (e.g., Alchemy, Infura) to monitor mempools, pending transactions, and contract deployments.
- **Gas Optimization**: Tools automatically adjust gas fees to outbid competitors, ensuring transactions are processed first.
- **Slippage Controls**: Users set maximum acceptable price deviations to avoid failed trades during volatile swings.
- **Token Blacklisting/Whitelisting**: Filters exclude scams or honeypot tokens, which are designed to trap snipers.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Snipers operate across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana, and other networks.

### Use Cases and Strategies

1. **Early Entry into Memecoins or Low-Cap Projects**  
   Snipers target speculative tokens with high social media buzz, aiming to ""ride the pump"" before dumping holdings at peak prices. This is common in memecoin ecosystems like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu derivatives.

2. **Arbitrage Between DEXs and CEXs**  
   Price differences between decentralized and centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) create arbitrage windows. Snipers buy tokens on DEXs during a price lag and sell them on CEXs for profit.

3. **Liquidity Pool Manipulation**  
   By adding liquidity early and withdrawing it after fees accumulate, snipers exploit yield farmers. Alternatively, they drain liquidity from vulnerable pools through flash loans or token dumps.

4. **Exploiting Tokenomics Flaws**  
   Some tokens have tax mechanisms, reflection rewards, or burn functions that snipers manipulate. For example, buying before a reflection distribution to claim rewards, then exiting.

### Risks and Ethical Concerns

- **Smart Contract Risks**: Snipers interact with unaudited contracts, risking exposure to rug pulls, honeypots, or code exploits.
- **Financial Losses**: Failed transactions, sudden price reversals, or gas wars (competing bots driving up fees) can erase profits.
- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Front-running and MEV extraction exist in legal gray areas. Authorities may classify these activities as market manipulation.
- **Ethical Debates**: Critics argue snipers undermine fair markets by prioritizing bots over retail traders. Developers increasingly implement safeguards like transaction delays (e.g., Uniswap V3's ""Dutch auction"" listings).

### Tools and Ecosystem

Popular sniper tools include:
- **Maestro**: A Telegram bot for sniping on Ethereum and BSC.
- **Banana Gun**: A no-code bot with anti-rug features and real-time charts.
- **Unibot**: A user-friendly interface for sniping and MEV strategies.
- **Custom Bots**: Advanced users code their own snipers using Python, Solidity, or Rust, often integrating with Web3.js or Ethers.js libraries."

My 160h Space Age Journey,factorio,1i4xijv,2025-01-19 07:37:01,38,0.98,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1i4xijv/my_160h_space_age_journey/,Sea-Assumption-7788,Space Age,"Hello everyone! I just finished Factorio Space Age after 160 hours (515 hours total playtime on Steam), and would like to share my save with you before I move on to new experiences, as a kind of farewell to all the spaghetti. Link to GoF: [https://factorio.com/galaxy/Stone%20I:%20Eta5-6.B6T4/planets](https://factorio.com/galaxy/Stone%20I:%20Eta5-6.B6T4/planets)

As I assume most do, my main base was on Nauvis. Here is a screenshot from map view of the monstrosity. 

https://preview.redd.it/sa5trp9c2yde1.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=15aaa4fc03f94f57d5903903635cb8cf283693b0

For my main base, I mostly used a bus system. However, as you can see from the map view, I ended up supplementing the bus with a lot of trains.

[Part of my Nauvis bus](https://preview.redd.it/wwiuuq6koxde1.png?width=3800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e70bff0ba78ae642f89b7c2609bee5e2dfc4263c)

Many of the bus features were meant to be temporary, such as the bot and lubricant production areas, but seeing as they worked, I never saw a need to replace them.

[Rail spaghetti](https://preview.redd.it/n07pphtwoxde1.png?width=3601&format=png&auto=webp&s=72708a6768effda618d0056a4efbed709236aa44)

I have never been much of a rail person. However, with the ever-growing need for long-range logistics with Space Age, I experimented quite a lot with trains and signals. On the other hand, I did not plan with expandability in mind, which resulted in situations such as the one pictured. 

Also pictured in the above image is my old steel production area consisting of both steel and electric furnaces, made completely obsolete by my liquid steel production (not pictured) but never removed.

I also did dabble with quality in Space Age, but I mostly only used my quality modules to create higher quality quality modules.

[Some quality production](https://preview.redd.it/02408xvhqxde1.png?width=2957&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d26f9c1efcaa0609a6104236449b19539a4a457)

Moving on to space, I started with a humble space science production ship which carried me through most of the game. I ended up making five copies of it to sustain my space science needs until I replaced it with a more functional ship.

[Space science production ship Sjors Schiebergen](https://preview.redd.it/qz9a4pqcrxde1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad5304edb2a2e992104b2a55b65c5e39b28102a9)

After much experimentation, I created a ship suitable for travel between the first planets. I was keen on exploring Fulgora, and needed a ship which could survive trips to and from the planet without manual interference.

The result was the ""Sky Runner"", kicking off a naming convention which I would go on to use for my other ship designs this save.

[Sky Runner](https://preview.redd.it/9oa5imurrxde1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=e126d335fb216b8821f46613721630737f02b401)

The philosophy behind the Sky Runner was for it to be quick and efficient for it to do laps between planets. I am quite pleased with the result, as the Sky Runner does produce enough ammo and fuel to keep going for quite some while, while also having some staying capabilities above planets. Its main weakness is its limited ammo production, which leaves the flanks exposed if there is a lack of iron.

Soon I would arrive at Fulgora.

[My main Fulgora base](https://preview.redd.it/12ucxhnpsxde1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=282815981a39fcb4100e7addcb40f5f3d60c9ec4)

I had a blast trying to understand Fulgora. At the same time, it was frustrating to deal with all the excess products, which led me to stay at the planet for far too many hours. Even though the final product is by no means perfect, it works, it produces a respectable amount of science, and it rarely deadlocks.

If I were to continue the game, my next goal for Fulgora would have been to create a dedicated quality production island which would have doubled as a trash handling system. In my experience, however, Fulgora is much more fun to theorycraft with than actually playing.

My next stop would be Vulcanus. First, however, I would need a ship to replace the Sky Runner.

[Mother](https://preview.redd.it/do39uobmuxde1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd1b24f58334659c80bcc6f124e5360c6fff6a86)

This is Mother, my first attempt at a larger ship. It builds upon the main features of Sky Runner, but with more fuel, ammo production and turret coverage. Although Mother was capable of interplanetary travel and did its job quite well when it worked, its dependency on inserter chains in the front made the ammo unevenly balanced which made parts of the ship unprotected. Combined with its exposed grabber wings, it was doomed from the start.

Engineering problems aside, I reached Vulcanus.

[My Vulcanus base](https://preview.redd.it/hhd40itrtxde1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=acef606593cf3da27cffbdb590cb6c63ba7e1dc5)

While Fulgora was part pain and part pleasure, Vulcanus was fun all the way through. Even though it took a good while destroying rocks to get my first foundries, I started snowballing quickly and felt quite powerful with my infinite resources and easy power production. There is really much more for me to say, this planet was really fun.

It was time to leave for Gleba, and I needed a new ship that did not fall apart.

[Mother 2](https://preview.redd.it/rfduvautvxde1.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=81afefb6c3058f338bb2d8b09375de54394266f3)

My next ship, Mother 2, was a great success. It features a broad turret coverage, uncommon grabbers and a large storage capacity. This ship carried me throughout most of the game and was used for all planets except Aquilo which needed missiles. The solar panels at the right hand could be swapped out for space science production, which I used in the endgame to boost my science. 

Mother 2 was my best friend in the mess that was Gleba.

[My Gleba base](https://preview.redd.it/zemvv4bsxxde1.png?width=2209&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7feeea678745cd4f12bead1bcb6bb3ef6a20263)

Gleba was a really fun learning experience. It was the first planet to make me rethink how production could work, and made me create some crazy production lines of nutrients and bioflux. 

My main issue with Gleba was the spoilage, which I thought I could fix with passive provider chests. Once those passive provider chests were filled, however, I thought the natural solution was active provider chests. This resulted in an ungodly amount of bots flying around my base constantly. It worked, but barely.

I was very happy with Gleba despite its bad reputation, and could see myself coming back at a later time. But now it was time for Aquilo, and therefore time for a new ship.

[Mother 3](https://preview.redd.it/w6xr8pbmyxde1.png?width=2587&format=png&auto=webp&s=782c99497ffb35c35f678bb40172270ba6266322)

My next ship, Mother 3, was another success. With its rectangular shape it does not look very exciting, but it does its job well. The firepower is doubled compared to Mother 2, epic quality grabbers and turrets are now put to use, asteroid reprocessing is utilized, and the whole thing is covered by a sushi belt of resources. The main problem with Mother 3 is its wild ammo consumption, which means it needs ammo imports from Nauvis to keep going constantly. 

[My Aquilo base](https://preview.redd.it/b1et7mgezxde1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=279542f7a59216afeaa773dc7edf0718812026df)

Like Gleba, I was very happy with how Aquilo made me rethink production. Constant power and heat outages made me constantly redo my designs, and the heating requirement made for some fun design challenges. This is probably my favourite from the new four planets.

Having done all I needed to do, it was time to complete the game.

[Pollyanna](https://preview.redd.it/99jwweppzxde1.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=55ea03d53aacb0d8effcf25c3c3c9c72e8b4bab9)

My final ship, Pollyanna, is larger than Mother 3 and is powered by fusion. The front is protected by a combination of gun, laser, rocket and railgun turrets, making it capable of powering through all asteroids. It also features room in the front for promethium storage.

This ship also has some design issues, such as a sub-par reprocessing area in the front and bad trash handling, which makes it prone to asteroid overflow. It also does not have enough production to keep up with a constant missile consumption towards the edge of the solar system, which made it necessary to stop the engines at 50 000 kilometers to let the ship reload.

Pollyanna was a fun creative project, and can certainly be made better, but I am happy with the result.

[Game complete!](https://preview.redd.it/0at7srb41yde1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d33599d46f2f6d97a77907db768dfd28f8e97f0)

And with that, the game was over. Pollyanna and I perished shortly after due to a lack of missiles.

Thank you to Wube for doing a great job with Factorio Space Age! I have never had such fun with an expansion to a game, and enjoyed every minute of it."
"Kamakura Kitajima, Kamakura",finedining,1i4tkyv,2025-01-19 02:56:39,22,0.92,6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4tkyv,magiquonnu,,"Kamakura Kitajima is Kanagawa prefecture's highest rated restaurant on Tabelog, holding a Silver award. They are located in a quiet residential area in Kamakura, away from the touristy parts of the town. They do kaiseki with a focus on Kamakura, or Kanagawa's local ingredients. 

This was a late Autumn 2024 visit. Apparently a fire broke out on the premises on mid-2024 and they had to stop operations for a while. On my visit there were no more signs of repair or construction.

Reservations are taken via Omakase once every month. The course price is advertised as 33000 yen on Omakase.

- Kousencha: The meal starts with tea. Very umami
- Ibaragani crab rice: A local species in the coast of Kanagawa. This was very delicious. My dish of the day. 👍👍👍
- Peanut tofu, cloud ear mushroom: Amazing combination of textures of flavors. There was also fried leaves and shimeji mushroom 👍👍
- Kanpachi sashimi: I felt that it was rarer to have this instead of Buri in/near winter time, but the texture and fat was quite nice
- Kuromutsu aburi: Insanely fatty and smoky 👍👍
- Kuroshibi Kamasu shabu-shabu, Kamakura vegetables: This was a rare type of local fish that pretty much never appears in restaurants. The chef mentioned he was experimenting and at some point had doubts whether the diners would like it or not. It turned out very tender and quite fatty, and the vegs were fresh too 👍👍👍
- Ni-kogori (jelly) from Shonan pork and mushrooms: This was very mediocre
- Komochi Ayu karaage: Fish fried whole. I think some diners asked for a smaller portion, and I do think I should've gotten a smaller one since it's quite big and ends up pretty oily on the palate, and it just tastes like a decent Ayu.
- Ebi-imo, kaibashira: I liked none of the elements in this dish.

I heard it's temporary, but they've been swapping the rice course with sushi, which is done by a different chef. Latest Tabelog reviews show that they're still doing it now.

Nigiri:
- Kihada maguro
- Mejina (blackfish)
- Aiburi
Those were some fishes I've never tried before. I found these to be mediocre (both shari/neta) and lacks fat.

- Tororo: Quite okay as a palate cleanser/filler
- Kinmuro Aji bozushi: Fatty and smoky. Better than the nigiri
- Kihada Maguro maki with local herbs, dill, negi: Sweet, herbal, umami. I like all the flavor combinations. 👍

At this point you can request more of the Aji bozushi, but the course is pretty substantial and I was full.

- Caramelized fig, fig compote in Koshu red wine, tea jelly
- Donguri (acorn) cake: First time having this and it was nice
- Gyokuro: The meal also ends with tea and this one tastes very grassy.

Overall it was nice to sample some of Kamakura, and Kanagawa's finest ingredients. The meal started off very strong but there were very unremarkable dishes, including the nigiri that were leagues below what you can find on Tokyo's top sushi places. Lastly, maybe it's due to disappointing taste of some of the dishes but I would've liked the prices to be slightly lower considering they source most, if not all, ingredients locally.

Buying Crypto in India? Here’s Your Ultimate Guide to Exchanges and DEXs ,beermoneyindia,1i4r8d1,2025-01-19 00:20:48,11,0.92,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyindia/comments/1i4r8d1/buying_crypto_in_india_heres_your_ultimate_guide/,BreakingOnReddit,Crypto,"# Understanding Crypto Exchanges and DEX: A Complete Guide

In a previous post, we explored **crypto wallets**, the secure digital vaults for storing your cryptocurrencies. Now, let’s move a step further into the world of **crypto trading platforms**—**Crypto Exchanges** and **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**—where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly. This post will dive into their differences, uses, and key considerations, especially for users in India.  
You can read the previous post at - [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyindia/comments/1ht8fkp/getting_started_with_crypto_easy_metamask_wallet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

# What Are Crypto Exchanges?

A **crypto exchange** is a platform where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies using fiat currency (like INR, USD) or other cryptocurrencies.

# Key Features of Crypto Exchanges:

1. **Centralized Management**: Most exchanges are centralized, meaning they are managed by an organization. Examples include:
   * **Binance -** [Sign up ref URL](https://www.binance.com/activity/referral-entry/CPA?ref=CPA_00ZH3AGXEJ)
   * **Kucoin-**  [Sign up with my ref URL](https://www.kucoin.com/r/rf/QBS1DU2Y)
2. **User-Friendly**: These platforms often have intuitive interfaces, making them suitable for beginners.
3. **Wide Range of Coins**: They support various cryptocurrencies, enabling users to diversify their portfolios.

# Advantages:

* Faster transactions.
* Customer support is available.
* Support for fiat-crypto trading pairs.

# Disadvantages:

* Higher fees compared to DEXs.
* Users must trust the platform for fund security.

# What Are Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)?

A **DEX** is a peer-to-peer platform that enables direct cryptocurrency trading without a central authority. Examples include:

* **Uniswap -** [Website](https://app.uniswap.org)
* [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/)
* [SushiSwap](https://www.sushi.com/ethereum/swap)

# Key Features of DEXs:

1. **No Middleman**: Transactions occur directly between users.
2. **Anonymity**: No need for account creation or KYC.
3. **Greater Control**: Users retain custody of their funds throughout the trading process.

# Advantages:

* Enhanced privacy.
* Access to new and smaller cryptocurrencies.
* No risk of exchange hacks.

# Disadvantages:

* Limited support for fiat currencies.
* Steeper learning curve for beginners.
* Slower transaction speeds during network congestion.

# Dos and Don’ts for Indian Users

# Dos:

1. Choose **Indian-compliant platforms** like Binance or kucoin if you’re just starting.
2. Conduct thorough research before trading.
3. Keep records of your transactions for tax purposes.
4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.(Must do)

# Don’ts:

1. Don’t ignore the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.
2. Avoid unregulated platforms to ensure legal compliance.
3. Don’t use exchnage wallet address to participate in airdrop.

# Why Is KYC Important in India?

Most centralized exchanges require **Know Your Customer (KYC)** verification to comply with Indian government regulations. KYC ensures:

1. Prevention of illegal activities like money laundering.
2. Identification of users for taxation and legal compliance.

Without KYC, many Indian exchanges limit trading functionality or withdrawals.

# A Note on Crypto Taxation in India

Since 2022, the Indian government mandates a **30% tax on crypto gains**. Additionally, a **1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)** applies to every transaction. Ensure compliance to avoid penalties.

**In Summary**: Both centralized exchanges and DEXs offer unique benefits. Beginners might find centralized exchanges more accessible, while advanced users may prefer the control offered by DEXs. Always prioritize security, legal compliance, and tax obligations when trading cryptocurrencies in India.

Aspects of the UI I did NOT get at first...,SatisfactoryGame,1i4d9vw,2025-01-18 13:00:31,8,0.83,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1i4d9vw/aspects_of_the_ui_i_did_not_get_at_first/,damurphy72,,"* I had no idea that swapping build mode in the case of conveyor lifts *changes the direction of the lifts*. I thought zoop mode was a revelation, but figuring out how to make lifts go down is a revolution in organizational flexibility.
* Conveyor mergers and splitters are just...incredibly powerful once you figure out what you can do with them. You can point them at a belt and they will appear on it, even in mid-air. They stack perfectly. They replace the head of a conveyor lift on either or both ends. The smart ones in the Caterium research in the MAM mean you can use Tier 3+ belts as sushi belts (mixed component) easily, cutting down on belt clutter.
* Cabling will autogenerate a pole or tower based on the point of origin. I was constantly putting down Tier 1 poles and then upgrading them where necessary.
* Transport mechanisms all have their little quirks. The zipline automatically hops when you let go -- making all of my spacebar jumping superfluous once I figured it out. The parachute can glide but descends slowly...unless you crouch, which drops you immediately. If you get sucked into a hypertube you can *reverse direction and crawl back out*. 
* I thought the stamps were the only way to do map icons. It seemed very limiting for such a complicated game. Then I noticed the + button. You can even make a marker automatically appear on the compass at different ranges. If I had one critique of the game UI, it's that there are a bunch of little configuration UI screens that are very easy to miss (the train station load/unload configuration, as another example).
* Some of the most useful stuff in the game is locked away in the AWESOME store, which I ignored because the first page of the catalog is a tiny cart and some brag statues. The ladder is the first thing I buy, now. Walls with conveyor openings and the wall mounts for both electrical and belts are also at the top of the list."

Someone with which to explore. A relationship/partnership in which we feel alive and energized. The fullest and truest expression of ourselves as individuals connected to the larger world. Realistic? Probably not. Romantic? Absolutely.

I have varied interests including creative projects like photography and writing. I'm a big fan of movies (Film, even 🧐), reading, fitness, getting outside when the weather allows, sushi, and pizza. I'm 5'7"" and far from a gym bro but I try to stay active and, at the absolute peak of my self-confidence (after a few bourbons), I've said to myself ""Yeah, you'd fill out a Spidey-suit pretty well."" (Embarrassing! What am I even talking about?) 

What you should know: My degree is in design but I have a pretty boring office job. I'm introspective, considerate, and try to remain empathic. I'm an introvert but I'm not shy. I've got the Big D (depression) but I'm working on it. I value real conversation.

What I'm looking for: Someone local to metro-Detroit. Someone who shares at least some of my interests and/or is interested in exploring, growing, and learning. Someone who also values good conversation, intimacy, and creativity. 

If any of this sounds interesting to you, please shoot me a chat with a fun fact about yourself. I'm happy to swap pics early (but no pressure)! 

Talk to you soon!

Pre-Covid, I found Automata through cosplay. I sprinted to ending A and lost interest (sadly common, it seems?) so I'm returning to a fresh save to jog my memory. Avoiding spoilers like the plague, but I'm making this post so you can live vicariously through a newcomer. We in the Outer Wilds fandom like that.

First time around, I was a loyal soldier. This playthrough, I'm acting like someone who hates YoRHa and wants to oppose them at every turn. I think that might earn me more letters on the save file.

Story-wise, I just got back from the initial encounter with A2. That's also the only encounter I have any memory of, which tells me I'm probably not even halfway.

Things I've done so far with notable consequences:

* Fought as badly as possible as early as possible
* Got curious while swapping chips
* Accepted dodgy sushi from a friend
* Overreacted explosively at a meeting with the higher ups

I've also considered attacking one or two allies, but in those cases the game wouldn't let me.

My one question is this: can I somehow communicate to the YoRHa Betrayers (of the quest of that name) that I come in peace? They seem to be hostile on sight."

Sun Princess - not another review ,PrincessCruises,1i0sfbf,2025-01-13 18:50:00,25,0.9,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1i0sfbf/sun_princess_not_another_review/,Owww_My_Ovaries,Review / Trip Report,"So this is my second time cruising princess.  We got a great deal last year on the Enchanted and had a great time, even if we did get a tad bored on the last day.  

We did the premier package and took advantage of many things with it. 

Let's start with well, food and drinks. 

MDR - Did this on our first night and it was fine.  Typical MDR.  Nothing excellent but nothing bad.  Really can't go into details because it was... fine.  We didn't have reservations until nine but headed there at 8pm because we were starving.  Got seated in about 15 minutes so not bad. 


Mokoto Sushi - the sushi was great.  Each peice was amazing and the rolls we got made of crab meat were also nothing short of great.  The only issue is the location.  The music and entertainment from the Piazza was defeaning. I could tell the server was a bit annoyed with it as well because all night she was repeating herself.  

Butchers Block - might be my favorite place due to the service.  Our server was amazing and went the extra mile.  Food came out at a perfect pace and the 2 extra t bones steaks she brought out for the table was the chefs kiss.  Yes, the 6 of us killed 3 bottles of 1.5L Chianti and downed some Grappa. Did I blow 300 on blackjack and then wonder my way to the international Cafe at 3am for 4 peices of chocolate cake afterwards.  Maybe...

Crown Grille - it was... fine.  The service was good but nothing compared to BB.  For some reason they brought my 65 year old mother out a giant porterhouse and me... a porterhouse that was half the thickness.  We laughed at it.  We ended up swapping plates too.  Overall very nice and only afterwards did they tell us that appetizers were basically unlimited at specialty restaurants... so I had some shrimp with my dessert.  


The next night we decided to hit Alfredos Pizza... or is it Pizza by Alfredos?  But we had no idea you got a full medium size pizza each. Pizza was excellent. Then we hit OMalleys and got some scotched eggs and wings.  I thought I was gonna die.  So we wondered back down to Butchers block and asked for some Grappa which we got.  Did I mention I loved the people at Butchers Block? 


The Catch - little disappointment in us not getting a glass of wine when we Walked in like on the Enchanted and... we had to ask for drinks, which was strange. But after we got our appetizers (the stew is awesome and comes in a cute crab bowl), the rest of the evening was great. Loved the surf and turf.


Spellbound - lot of fun here.  The food was really good.  Got the filet and really enjoyed the spellbound branded red wine.  The show in the special bar was fun and we got some cool drinks served in magical boxes that were filled with smoke.  The show itself was great and the magician was a lot of fun.  I guess this is the place the Captain takes his entourage of women as well since he was enjoying cocktails with three young women. Good for him. 


Lido Deck - Pizza was fine but don't do the Tuna pizza.  Whoever thought that was a good combo.  Nope. Burgers and brats were good but sometimes took half an hour to get (the pager system was a good idea).  Salad area had some awesome bowls and the lamb pita by the taco and nacho area is a must. 


Drinks - I'm a wine drinker and thought the overall selection was a bit bare for the most part.  Nit terrible but nothing memorable, outside killing all that Chianti at BB.  


Layout - the eatery is a mad house for breakfast. I like how the food is served by rhe staff and not a free for all since I was the only one besides my family that seemed to wash their hands. The Enchanted buffet area was much better imo.  More food choices and more room. 


The gym - pretty cramped.  Why people decide to workout for the first time on vacation blows my mind.  I'm your avid gym rat and getting a bench to hit the weights was a pain. 


The pool - never felt too crowded after the first day.  I was out there at 6am on sea days to lay down towels.... joking... I was out there and stayed out there.  I'm not one of those clowns.  And thankfully the staff removed towels that were laid down and left.  Thank you. 


Medallion service - excellent.  On the Enchanted we maybe got half our orders and the ones we got took 40+ minutes.  I ordered room service to the pool or to our room 25 times.  Everyone showed up in around 20 minutes or less.  One time it took 10 minutes to get a night cap of tequila delivered to our room. Much improved. 

Never did the dome. We did the theater once for some mind reader and it was fun if not a bit cramped.  

But overall.  It was a fun time.  The workers on the boat were AMAZING. And outside this group of women wearing sailors hats and making a spectical about themselves, everyone on board was polite.  Ya the boat had some rough nights but Princess can't control the wind. We booked another trip for next year on board and can't wait to go back.  

I thought the overall layout was fine.  People complaining that it was confusing must have been drunk because after 1 day it was easy to find everything.  And outside the first day when boarding the elevators worked great with their new TouchPad system.  Our room was cleaned right away and always looked great.

Discover Asia: A Journey Full of Wonders,AsiaTraveltips,1i0g7lt,2025-01-13 10:17:00,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsiaTraveltips/comments/1i0g7lt/discover_asia_a_journey_full_of_wonders/,hsnyami,,"I’ve always dreamed of exploring Asia—there’s something so magical about the diversity, history, and natural beauty this continent offers. 

Whether it’s sipping tea in a Japanese garden, wandering through the temples of Angkor Wat, or relaxing on the pristine beaches of the Maldives, Asia truly has it all.

Recently, I came across an article that opened my eyes to even more amazing destinations and tips for traveling in Asia: [Asia Tourist: Your Ultimate Guide to Exploring the Wonders of Asia](https://asiajourney.org/travel-tips-for-asia-tourists/). 

It’s such a handy guide for anyone who wants to make the most of their trip, whether you’re a first-timer or a seasoned traveler.

Here are some things I love about Asia that the article also highlights:

1. **Incredible Diversity of Cultures** 🌏 From the bustling streets of Bangkok to the peaceful monasteries of Bhutan, every country feels like stepping into a completely new world. The guide does a great job of showcasing how to experience these cultures authentically.

Hello, I (26m) have been experiencing essential tremors in my hands since my last covid infection. I'm genetically predisposed to Parkinson's and the anxiety of it all is killing me. I mask everywhere, I bought a pluslife machine, I got my housemate to mask, and have had to stop seeing friends and family because they care more about not masking than mine, or anyone else's health. I've always wanted to have a child, to raise a child and be in its life unlike my father. How would I even raise a child covid conscious? Do I want to pass my Parkinson's on? How will I fall in love and get married if the rest of the world has regressed in its understanding and awareness of germ theory?

I've felt so blessed to have 2 housemates/childhood friends who mask, as well as my best friend who has kept me on the right path, covid wise, all this time. However, my housemates' significant other's both don't mask, and that is concerning. I don't know how to address that without ""policing their behavior"". One of my housemate's who I assumed was on the same page as me, casually mentioned how they were eating at a sushi place in the mall with their girlfriend and I almost cried. I'm glad they mask in grocery stores, at work, and on the bus, but hearing about this made me wonder how often they actually even mask.

My other housemate was talking about how he'll go out with his partner, and get takeout and drink with their sip valve while their partner eats; which almost entirely defeats the purpose when he then swaps spit with them as soon as they leave the building. 

I work with disabled adults, and they have goals to go grocery shopping or other public activities, and considering their intellectual disabilities they won't/can't mask, and can't fully comprehend the reason why they should. Making someone who can't mask go places without masking feels like a eugenics campaign.

Everyone in my life who cares, doesn't care enough; those who don't care complain about never seeing me. Both groups seem to be far happier than I am. I fail to see the value in being around anymore sometimes. I'm going on a small solo vacation soon and considered for a second loosening my precautions for my trip, to live my life they way I used to, but I know that covid would only disable me further and put the lives of my clients at risk. I can't find any joy in anything virtual; zoom calls and stuff like that are just as meaningful to me as a text message, and I can't emotionally connect with anyone via any form of telecommunication (I've tried). Do I just accept that my life will forever be  just be as hollow as it is now? This doesn't end. I'll be alone with the one other person in my region who actually tries.

I love my clients and I will live to support them no matter what, although life feels... the way it does right now, I find fulfillment working with the people I do, and am not suicidal, just feeling lost.
How do you all cope? Is there any hope for things to get better (i.e. normalized masking)?"

Huel H&S pots still rock! Keurig update + flavor descriptions/ratings,Huel,1i072fe,2025-01-13 00:32:36,9,0.85,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1i072fe/huel_hs_pots_still_rock_keurig_update_flavor/,TieLower6104,,"Ever since I discovered that my Korean BBQ Huel H&S was objectively better when made with a Keurig single serve coffee maker and subsequently went on a drunk rant about it in the sub on New Year’s Eve (you’re welcome btw), I decided that I’d try out all of the flavors using this method and record my findings, to see if my observations held true across the product line. 

Now that my little project is done, I’d like to share my findings —completely sober and only a little unhinged. If you want the TL;DR well then yeah, using a Keurig at the 6oz setting works and the flavors are generally agreeable (Cajun pasta needs improvement). You may now exit the post and continue scrolling elsewhere. 

However if you want the deets, well then LOCK IN cuz we’s takin’ the long way home. 



First off, I had to buy a Keurig to do my experiments at home —no time for science projects at work, that’s the rub. I bought the bougie “K-Supreme Plus® Single Serve Coffee Maker”, partly for the increased potential for customization but mostly because I wanted it to match the other stainless steel appliances on my countertop (they do make a pretty slick set if I do say so myself). For further reference, my workplace has the “Keurig® K-Elite® Single Serve Coffee Maker” —which is also the most common model I’ve personally seen elsewhere out in the wild. For whatever reason on this ‘elite’ model, Keurig made the big brain ‘elite’ decision to use a miscellaneous set of pictures of teacups and coffee mugs for their different volume setting buttons instead of just directly stating how many ounces each button pours (In case you also find this confusing, the settings are 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 oz).

As far as actually using the Keurig, the first step is to open it to make sure there’s not already a previously used k-pod still in the machine. If there is, then throw out the old k-pod (while mumbling obscenities about your coworker Vincent, who never clears the Keurig when he’s done with it).  Depending on the model, it may be a good idea to run the Keurig blank to flush out any coffee grounds residue (my new bougie Keurig has this problem but the regular workplace one doesn’t).



And now without further ado, let’s brew some lunch. 



**Chick’n & Mushroom Pasta**

I’ve had this one before in the old multi serve pouches and generally found this flavor as the best of all available at the time. It used to be a penne pasta so the first thing I noticed when opening the packaging was that the pasta changed to smaller swirly bits. 

First up, I went with the recommended 6 oz (3/4 cup) and 5 minutes of wait time. The 5 minutes of sit time isn’t enough (which is true for all of the flavors using a Keurig) and this one it needs the longest sit time of them all at more like 12 minutes (the others are fine after about 8 minutes). Even then, its consistency is more runny than it looks in the advertising. I tried it again at the 4oz setting but then it was crunchy and too thick. For my kettle bros, consider using 5oz. But for those of you also fixed on the “press button, get lunch” concept, just use the recommended 6oz and wait a couple extra minutes.  I saw another user recently make their H&S in a thermos to allow longer sit time without the meal going cold, which would work out great for this flavor in particular, especially if using the sachets instead of the pots (this flavor comes in both packagings).  

The flavor itself reminds me of stroganoff, specifically the Americanized boxed Hamburger Helper version. The base flavor is a cream-of-mushroom body with chicken bullion. Secondary flavor is black pepper and the tertiary flavor is chives and thyme —which are only really noticeable as a mildly pleasant aftertaste. There’s enough salt in here that I don’t notice its absence but not enough that I’d consider the meal particularly salty; it’s appropriate for the rest of the flavors here. There is also no weird chemical or additive taste. 

No recommendations for overall flavor improvement but if you really wanted the mouthfeel to be like biting into my childhood, change the pasta style to truncated lasagna strips. 

  
Taste: 4.5/5

Keurig Settings: 6 oz

Wait time: 10-12 minutes 

  


**Cajun Pasta**

I’ve had this one before too. It’s bad. In the past, “it’s bad” was about as much thought as I’d given the product before dropping the whole bag into the trash can and moving on. But in the name of science, I went at it again and this time put in some more effort into my observations.

The flavor tastes like pea protein powder mixed with Old Bay seasoning. It’s almost kind of like a sad neutered version of jambalaya and thinking of it like this makes the lack of seafood and/or sausage flavors glaringly obvious (which is no doubt why they didn’t just name it that). The flavor is passable but not good. The mouthfeel, however, is much better as pasta than it would have been with rice because if you use your imagination a little, then the pasta mouthfeel is similar to that of crawfish (which to be clear, gross me out. A vegetarian version of those little fuckers is an improvement in my book).

I’ll give this one a 3/5 for flavor, so I’d eat it if it was given to me but I wouldn’t look forward to it. For reference, I’m generally not a picky eater and have lower taste requirements than the average Joe because I’m mostly here for the science + convenience. However at $5 a pop, any product below a 4/5 is likely unacceptable to the average working American (and I guess I should add that even my subjective 5/5 isn’t on par with ‘the best thing I’ve ever eaten’ and is instead ‘the best/tastiest nutritionally complete meal that can be reasonably achieved from this format and at this price point’). 

So anyways, 3/5 this flavor is SUBPAR (in my not-so-humble opinion) unless improved. The main problem is that the mostly neutral but faintly earthy ‘pea protein + nutrient wonderbled’ flavor is front and center when it should be invisible. Also, what’s missing here are the seafood + sausage flavors of more traditional jambalaya or a seafood boil. 

To my taste, there’s a near immediately obvious solution (which I later tried irl for proof of concept and does indeed work, up to 4.5+/5). Wanna know what crawfish tastes like? Earthy shrimp. So add in some shrimp bouillon (which makes use of the otherwise wasted shell of shrimp but not the flesh —so still vegetarian but not vegan) along with some vegan bacon bits and you’d kill 2 birds with one stone. This would both hide the out-of-place flavor better and give a more robust flavor base for the Old Bay seasoning to subsequently enhance. Add in a bit more cayenne pepper tho so that the new flavors don’t take away from that last little kick of pizazz at the tail end of the flavor profile —preferably from the classic original Louisiana Hot Sauce to both add in a bit of acidity and thematically stick the landing.  If you want to go the extra mile and fully commit to the whole ‘seafood boil’ aesthetic, consider swapping the wheat based pasta for a potato based pasta like gnocchi.



Taste: 3/5. Add bacon bits, a pinch or two of shrimp bouillon, and more cayenne pepper (hot sauce).

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 



**Spicy Gochujang Noodles**

This write up is both a relief and a bummer cuz I originally did a much longer write up on an old batch of the spicy g-noodle cups. I’ll spare you the details (tho you can assume it was witty, well-considered, and involved a g-sauce fueled adventure to a local Korean restaurant) but I didn’t like it. I gave it a substandard 3.5/5 and felt that the fermented spicy tofu noodles ultimately needed a pork flavor, some sweetener, and pickled cucumbers. 

However, when I got my new batch of pots, the g-noods were new and improved (or maybe just not expired lol). There was a sweet tang added to the spicy-ness that I felt checked off my ‘add sweetener’ box and gave a satisfactory alternative for my ‘needs pork’ box. Updated taste rating is 4/5, tho I still think the product could be improved with some freeze dried pickled cucumber chunks.  



Taste: 4/5. 

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 

  


**Korean BBQ**

Don’t change a thing babygirl, you’re beautiful just the way you are. 

  
Taste: 5/5. No notes. 

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 

  


**Japanese Curry**

This one is fine I guess. There’s nothing distinctly wrong with the flavor, but it is a bit underwhelming at first. It’s like going to the best sushi restaurant in your town but then ordering off the ‘entree’ section of the menu instead of the ‘sushi’ section —it’s exactly what you ordered but somehow not what you wanted.

I don’t particularly enjoy curry on a personal basis (do we really need FOUR curry flavors btw??) but objectively, it tastes is good. The flavor profile is full bodied but unapologetically simple: a mellow yellow curry with some vegetable accents and a pleasant lingering tangy aftertaste. Humble, but what it lacks in oomph, it makes up for in comfort. The mouthfeel is good too, it doesn’t feel like eating dehydrated instant noodles; it just feels like eating food. 

By the end of our fictional restaurant meal, you are no longer jealous of your friends who ordered sushi and are instead perfectly content with your Japanese moon curry —a dish name which is entirely made up but feels right for this flavor. Generally when i hear ‘Japanese food’, my flavor expectations immediately goes to raw salmon, soy sauce, and wasabi. So when I first heard of a ‘Japanese Curry’ flavor, I was kind of just like “huh, curry and soy sauce? Not sure how ur gonna pull that off but I guess I’ll try it”.  To be fair, I don’t have weeb level knowledge of Japanese cuisine (I’d never heard of ‘Katsu’ before reading the product description) so my expectations were probably misplaced but I’d wager that I’m not too far off from the average American. Adding some sort of modifier between ‘Japanese’ and ‘curry’ (‘moon’ or otherwise) would help to better manage those expectations imo.



Taste: 4/5 

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 

  


**Szechuan Spiced Noodles**

This one is actually quite similar to the Spicy Gochujang Noodles. It’s to the point that on initial tasting, I had to recheck the label to make sure I’d made the right pot. I then immediately decided to taste them both side-by-side and the differences became more apparent. They both have a paprika flavor base with a bit of sweetness and some tang. The main difference is that the g-noods have a secondary Asian sweet-n-sour sort of taste and these z-noods instead have a secondary flavor of chives, onion, and a hint of black pepper. 

I much prefer these z-noodles and although it could be improved with some dehydrated green beans, the flavor profile feels complete without them. I do, however, regret tasting them side-by-side tho cuz now all I can think about is how the (otherwise fine) g-noods taste like how I imagine the z-noods would taste like if they expired and went bad. 



Taste: 4.5/5

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 

  


**Thai Noodles**

The flavor here is different, but neither in a distinctly good nor bad way. I had a difficult time trying to decide if I liked it or not and had eaten the whole pot before I’d come to a conclusion, which I guess is conclusion enough for me. There’s an immediate sharp sweet soy flavor to the front of the flavor profile and then the initial flavor backs off to unveil a middling flavor of peanuts, garlic, and onion. Finally, the flavor abruptly ends and there is little to no aftertaste. There’s something missing here tho and I couldn’t put my finger on it at first. 

To help me figure it out, I walked over to the Thai restaurant down the street and ordered some take-out Pad Thai to compare. When tasting the real thing side-by-side with the Huel analog, I think that Huel has done a pretty good job —at least considering that the Huel product is constrained to being ‘nutritionally complete’ (and vegan, unfortunately). My real Pad Thai had a similar overall taste experience except the soy flavor is dialed back and the sweetness picks up in the middle of the flavor profile (instead of right in the front) along with a more salient peanut flavor which lingers into the aftertaste. However, the real pad Thai also had a bit of scrambled eggs mixed in and this is where a lot of the ‘savory’ came from. The real thing also had bean sprouts which help create a more interesting texture but don’t have much impact on taste. 

Notwithstanding, I still give this Huel flavor a 4.25/5 cuz I do like it (more than the j or g-noods but less than the Ckn&Mshrm or z-noods). That said, this flavor has the potential for 5/5 with some adjustments: dial back the soy sauce flavor and add in a vegetarian/vegan alt for scrambles eggs, such as JUST Egg (or just actual egg if I were to have my way). Some dehydrated bean sprouts would be appreciated too but aren’t strictly necessary.   


Taste: 4.25/5

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 

  
  


Aaaand that’s it. That’s the post. I almost wanted to launch into new flavor requests for H&S and also for the (probably not) forthcoming Huel chips/‘crisps’ (a theoretical product I’d thought up and mentioned at the end of my previous rant). But this post is already too long and I’ve completed what I’d set out to do. So thanks for your time, have a good day, and whatever you do, don’t try tasting the g and z-noodles together.

Akuma Inu - moonshot or not?,CryptoMoonShots,1hyaezo,2025-01-10 12:56:45,10,0.77,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hyaezo/akuma_inu_moonshot_or_not/,1001000010000100100,Other (chain not covered by other flairs),"Hey everyone,

I’ve got something massive to share: Akuma Inu (AKUMA), a meme-based cryptocurrency on the Base blockchain that’s capturing the full-on “degen” spirit—wild price action, epic community, and a top-tier marketing push.

Why Akuma Inu?

	1.	Epic Team & Market Maker

	•	The core devs are holding strong and continue to deliver.

	•	Wintermute is the market maker backing AKUMA, which is a huge stamp of legitimacy in the crypto space.

	2.	Influencer Support

	•	We’re seeing major hype from OG Dogecoin influencer Matt Wallace and other top crypto personalities.

	•	Epic memes are flooding social platforms. The “bad dog” narrative is giving serious Doge vibes but with an edgier twist.

	3.	Coinbase Rumors

	•	Word on the street is that if this continues trending upward, a Coinbase listing might be in the cards. The momentum here is real.
	4.	High Growth Potential

	•	Current market cap: $804 million (as of Jan 10, 2025).

	•	Some in the community (myself included) believe this could run to a $2.5 billion market cap if it keeps trending like this. That leaves a ton of room for growth.

Tokenomics Snapshot
	•	Total Supply: 666,666,666,666 AKUMA

	•	Circulating Supply: 670 billion tokens (they’re saying no massive unlocked supply bombs looming).

	•	Market Cap: $804 million right now.

	•	24h Trading Volume: $5.86 million.

	•	Price Action: +246.40% in the past week, which outperformed much of the crypto market (which actually dipped ~7%).

Disclaimer: This is a meme coin, and meme coins are notoriously volatile. Do your own research!

Trending & Community
	•	Social Media Buzz: AKUMA is everywhere on X (Twitter). Meme campaigns, influencer partnerships, daily trending hashtags—this project is not sleeping.
	•	Bullish Sentiment: Over 73% are bullish according to recent polls.

Where to Buy?
Decentralized Exchanges:

	•	Uniswap V3 (Base)

	•	Uniswap V2 (Base)

	•	SushiSwap V3 (Base)
	
Centralized Exchanges:
	•	Gate.io

	•	MEXC

	Most active trading pair is AKUMA/WETH on Uniswap, with $5,214,271 in 24h volume.

Contract & References
	•	Contract Address (CA): 0x2F20Cf3466f80A5f7f532fCa553c8cbc9727FEf6


	•	CoinMarketCap: Akuma Inu Official Listing https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/akuma-inu/

Things to Keep in Mind (Due Diligence)

	1.	Volatility: AKUMA is a meme coin. Price can skyrocket or dump just as quickly.

	2.	Market Dynamics: Driven by hype, social media trends, and community sentiment (which can be unpredictable).

	3.	Investment Risk: Always invest within your risk tolerance. Meme coins carry high risk but can offer outsized gains if timed right.

Final Thoughts

Akuma Inu might just be the next big “bad dog” after Shiba and Doge, backed by a strong community, top influencers, and a potential Coinbase listing hype. If you’re into degen plays with big upside, AKUMA is worth a look. Not financial advice, but keep your eyes on it—this dog is howling for attention!

Join the Pack:
Buy on Uniswap, Gate.io, MEXC, or follow the hype on social media. Let’s see how far this bad dog can run!

DYOR and stay safe, everyone!"

Transparency Update: Swapped SushiSwap V3 NFT to V2 LP for Liquidity Locking,GDBL,1hxzl1s,2025-01-10 03:01:45,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GDBL/comments/1hxzl1s/transparency_update_swapped_sushiswap_v3_nft_to/,Pretty-Advertising73,,"Hey everyone,

In the spirit of full transparency with our community, I wanted to give you an update on our liquidity situation. Originally, the liquidity for GoldDoubloons (GDB) was held in a SushiSwap V3 NFT, which represents our position in their liquidity pool.

However, to ensure we could lock the liquidity and demonstrate our commitment to the project, I had to swap the V3 NFT back to the SushiSwap V2 LP token format. This format is compatible with most liquidity-locking platforms, allowing us to securely lock the liquidity and provide proof to our community.

Why This Matters:
-Trust & Stability: Locked liquidity shows we’re here for the long haul and eliminates fears of a rug pull.
-Transparency: I want you all to know exactly what’s happening behind the scenes.

If you have any questions about this process or want more details, feel free to ask! We’re committed to keeping things clear and building a strong foundation together.

Let’s keep the momentum going—this is just the beginning! 🏴‍☠️"
How Do I Lock a Uniswap V3 LP NFT?,NFT,1hxw8cy,2025-01-09 23:21:35,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1hxw8cy/how_do_i_lock_a_uniswap_v3_lp_nft/,Pretty-Advertising73,Technical,"I’ve recently provided liquidity on SushiSwap V3, and I received an LP NFT representing my position. I want to ensure transparency and build trust in my project by locking this NFT, but I’m not entirely sure of the best way to go about it.

Does anyone have experience with locking Uniswap V3 LP NFTs? Specifically:
	•	What platforms or services support locking Uniswap V3 LP NFTs?
	•	Are there any specific steps or considerations I should be aware of?
	•	How do I provide proof to the community once it’s locked?

I’d really appreciate any guidance or recommendations. Thanks in advance for the help! 🙌

The Comprehensive Guide to Understanding the Difference Between CEX and DEX,CoinsForge,1hwcybm,2025-01-08 00:58:11,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinsForge/comments/1hwcybm/the_comprehensive_guide_to_understanding_the/,Dunnoman7,,"# [The Comprehensive Guide to Understanding the Difference Between CEX and DEX](https://www.coinsforge.info/2025/01/the-comprehensive-guide-to.html)

# In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, the ways in which digital assets are traded and managed have become increasingly diverse. Centralized Exchanges (CEX) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) are two primary models dominating the crypto trading landscape. While both serve the purpose of facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, they differ significantly in structure, operation, and user experience. Understanding these differences is crucial for both new and experienced traders looking to navigate the crypto market efficiently.







# What is a Centralized Exchange (CEX)?

# A Centralized Exchange is a traditional model of cryptocurrency trading platforms where a central authority oversees and facilitates all transactions. Examples of popular CEXs include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. These exchanges act as intermediaries, providing users with an intuitive interface to buy, sell, and trade digital assets.

# Key Features of CEX:

# 

# A) Custodial Nature: CEXs hold user funds in their own wallets. This means users rely on the exchange to secure their assets.

# 

# 

# B) User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, centralized platforms often cater to beginners and seasoned traders alike.

# 

# 

# C) High Liquidity: Centralized exchanges typically have a large pool of users, resulting in higher liquidity and faster trade execution.

# 

# 

# D) Advanced Trading Tools: These platforms often offer features like margin trading, futures, and advanced charting tools.

# 

# However, CEXs are not without their drawbacks. Centralized control makes them vulnerable to hacking and regulatory scrutiny. Users must also trust the platform to act responsibly with their funds and personal data.

# What is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?

# A Decentralized Exchange operates without a central authority, utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer trading. Notable examples of DEXs include Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap. Transactions on a DEX occur directly between users’ wallets using smart contracts.



# 



# Key Features of DEX:

# 

# A) Non-Custodial Nature: Users retain full control of their funds, as transactions occur directly from their wallets.

# 

# 

# B) Enhanced Privacy: No mandatory account creation or KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are necessary.

# 

# 

# C) Decentralization: Operates on blockchain technology, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

# 

# 

# D) Token Accessibility: Often lists a wider range of tokens, including newly launched or less popular ones.

# 

# Despite these advantages, DEXs face challenges like lower liquidity, slower transaction speeds, and a steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology.

# Comparing CEX and DEX

# Let’s break down the differences between Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges across several critical factors:

# Control and Custody:

# CEX: Custodial. Users’ assets are stored within the exchange’s infrastructure.

# DEX: Non-custodial. Users maintain full control of their funds.

# Ease of Use:

# CEX: Generally easier for beginners due to their user-friendly interfaces.

# DEX: Requires a basic understanding of blockchain wallets and smart contracts.

# Privacy:

# CEX: Requires KYC compliance, which involves sharing personal information.

# DEX: Allows for anonymous trading without account creation.

# Liquidity:

# CEX: Typically higher liquidity due to large user bases and institutional participation.

# DEX: Liquidity can vary and often relies on liquidity pools funded by users.

# Security:

# CEX: Vulnerable to hacks due to centralized control.

# DEX: More secure as funds are stored in users’ wallets, but smart contract vulnerabilities can be a risk.

# Regulatory Compliance:

# CEX: Must adhere to regional and international regulations.

# DEX: Operates with less regulatory oversight, though this may change as regulations evolve.

# Pros and Cons of CEX

# Pros:

# High liquidity and faster transactions.

# Intuitive for beginners.

# Advanced trading tools and features.

# Cons:

# Custodial nature poses security risks.

# Requires user trust in the platform.

# Subject to regulatory constraints.

# Pros and Cons of DEX

# Pros:

# Enhanced privacy and anonymity.

# Users retain control over their funds.

# Accessibility to a broader range of tokens.

# Cons:

# Lower liquidity compared to CEX.

# Less beginner-friendly.

# Vulnerable to issues like impermanent loss in liquidity pools.

# Choosing Between CEX and DEX

# The choice between a CEX and a DEX depends on individual needs and preferences. For beginners or those seeking a seamless trading experience, CEXs are an ideal starting point. They offer a safe environment to learn and trade with a robust support system. On the other hand, experienced traders and those prioritizing privacy or decentralization may find DEXs more appealing.

# The Future of CEX and DEX

# The cryptocurrency industry is still maturing, and both CEX and DEX models are evolving. Innovations like hybrid exchanges aim to combine the best aspects of both systems. Furthermore, advancements in blockchain scalability and security may address some of the challenges faced by DEXs, making them more competitive with their centralized counterparts.

# Conclusion

# Understanding the difference between Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges is essential for navigating the crypto trading ecosystem effectively. While CEXs offer convenience and accessibility, DEXs provide privacy and control. By weighing the pros and cons of each, traders can make informed decisions that align with their goals and risk tolerance. As the industry continues to innovate, the lines between CEX and DEX may blur, leading to more integrated and user-centric trading solutions.The Comprehensive Guide to Understanding the Difference Between CEX and DEX

The coin released a little over a day ago. I'm thinking it's built into smart contract that anything smaller than a whale can't sell until coin releases in a week on binance. But I'm not sure. It show major exchanges as whales on coin. Coinbase 5 wallet for instance. I worried its a honeypot but it's seems legit. I was told about it from a friend who brother in law works at a major exchange. I tried to send and swap a small amount using coinbase defi wallet and sushiswap. I can buy more but won't allow me to sell,swap or transfer. I'm investor number 34 with 226k and what's crazy is the value is zero on both platforms until I try to swap it says with 16k usd...is there a chance it's in contract that nobody but whales can sell until listed on binance?

I’ve seen others post about eating small amounts of rice, but for me, even one tiny bite leaves me feeling uncomfortably full and sick. Because of that, I’ve decided to avoid it altogether.

Recently, I’ve started making rice-free sushi rolls as an alternative, and they’ve been a game-changer! They’re easy to prep for lunch, satisfy my cravings, and, most importantly, they leave me feeling great.

If you’re struggling with similar issues post-op, I highly recommend giving these a try. They’re a simple, delicious way to enjoy those familiar flavors without the discomfort.

What are your go-to swaps for foods you’ve had to give up? I’d love to hear more ideas!"

Además de los gigantes como Uniswap y Aave, plataformas como PancakeSwap en Binance Smart Chain y SushiSwap con su enfoque multichain podrían ser protagonistas clave en este mercado alcista. ¿Será la narrativa de las DeFi lo suficientemente sólida para mantenerse en el centro de atención?

I know a lot of people are bored of these kinds of diaries, so I didn't want anyone to waste their time.**

#Intro:

I'm 36F, work for the government. My husband, 39M, also works for the government. We have two kids (son[3] IVF, daughter [1] unexpected miracle). We live in Orange County, CA. We married in 2020.

Salary: I make $120,000~ and my husband makes $110,000~. Our post-tax/deductions earnings are $1,600 2x a month for me, $1,900 2x a month for him. I pay for FSA for the kids, FSA for myself, health insurance, dental, etc., and save more into my 401k equivalent. So, per month, we take home about $7,000. We have a joint bank account, joint CC, and I handle all household financial matters other than his personal retirement.

#Income Progression:

**2011** - Graduated with a liberal arts degree (BA).

**2011** - Worked full time as a personal assistant for $15,000 annually.

**2012** - Stopped working (lived with a bf who was making $23,000) and studied at a local community college for a year to take business & accounting classes.

**2013** - Worked as an accounting assistant for $22,000. Left after CFO sexually harassed me.

**2014** - Worked as an office manager for $40,000. No benefits, but was on my parents' insurance.

**2015** - Quit my job for graduate school and moved back with my parents. Donated my eggs, was compensated enough to pay for graduate school and living expenses (outside of rent).

**2016** - Graduated with an offer of $65,000 plus $3,000 sign on bonus, plus insurance, 401k match, FSA! I started saving for retirement here.  

**2017** - Same job, $72,000 salary.

**2018** - Same job, promoted, $85,000 salary.

**2019** - Left job while making $96,000. Took a government job with salary of $68,000.

**2020** - Same job, $73,000 salary.

**2021** - Same job, $75,000 salary.

**2022** - Same job, $91,000 salary.

**2023** - Same job, $95,000 salary.

**2024** - Switched positions but same work, $120,000 salary.

#Assets:

Assets|Amount|
:--|:--:|
Cash| $4,000 |
Retirement (mine)| $317,000|
Retirement (husband)| $77,000|
Son's 529| $12,650| 
Son's UTMA| $9,520| 
Daughter's 529| $4,250| 
Daughter's UTMA| $2,700| 
**Total excluding kids' accounts**:|**$398,000**

I have been saving for retirement since 2016. My husband worked before 2016 but stopped until 2021. We both have decent pensions (mine is 33% of my highest income until I die and his is closer to 40% of his highest income until he dies), so I look at my retirement savings as more of something I will most likely leave to my kids. I should probably just buy real estate, but I would rather have the tax savings.

We used about $15,000 of cash this year moving. The home is not listed in assets (or debt) because my parents bought it under their name and pay for the mortgage. The condo worth is $1,200,000 (based on two almost exact ones selling in the past six months on this street). My parents pay the mortgage. Before we moved, we also lived with them (rent free).

If we put the 529 in my parents' names, it would not be counted for FAFSA. However, we make enough and honestly have enough. Our kids don't need help from the government when they have us.


#Debt:

Debt|Amount|
:--|:--:|
Student loans (husband)| $5,000 |
Car (mine)| $5,000|
Best Buy CC|$3,300|
Ikea CC|$3,000|
**Total**:|$**16,300**

My husband went back to school for four years and graduated in 2021. Most of his education was paid for via scholarship, but he took out a little bit for housing. The loans were deferred until 2023. My car, which we both use but is under my name and my dad's, should be paid off in a year or so.

Ikea CC is 24 month interest free. Best Buy CC is also 24 months interest free. We made large purchases when we moved this year. We do not use the cards for anything else. I divided the amount owed by 23 months and pay a little over that number each month.

#Monthly Expenses:

Expense|Amount|
:--|:--:|
Daycare| $1,900 |
Gas| $25 |
Electric|$150|
Trash|$32 |
Water|$50 |
Cell phone |$170 |
Internet|$150|
Life insurance|$55|
Car insurance|$100|
529s |$700 |
UTMA|$400|
Best Buy CC| $200|
Ikea CC|$150|
Car loan|$343|
Annual CC fee/12 for Chase|$46|
WoW subs|$26|
Disney/Hulu|$3|
Netflix|$7|
Google One|$8|
Apple Cloud|$1|
Donations|$78|
**Total**:|**$4,595**

If I had to pay for my daughter's care ($2,000 for infant care) and mortgage+property tax+HOA fee ($3,300 + $400 + $300 = $4,000), our expenses would be $10,595. My parents take care of my daughter and pay for our living expenses, even though they are both retired.

I have not yet decided what to do when my kids are out of daycare. Do I take over the mortgage? Do I put that ~$2,000 into their 529s/investment accounts/UTMAs? I asked my parents if I could help pay for the mortgage now but they said no.

Initially, I did try to buy the house (to personally take the mortgage) but my parents insisted they buy it and wouldn't let me do it. Because the home belonged to a family member that passed away, there was no way for me to buy it without my parents agreeing. I also would have not been able to take a 15 year at 2.5% mortgage, which is what my parents have. 

Of the people I know in my city/area for whom I know the financial background: 

- one is a single man who was given their house by their parents (not sure about salary)
- one is a single woman who lives in a home owned by her parents (not sure about salary)
- one is a married couple with one kid who make slightly more than us that had their parents help with the down payment on their 1mil house
- one is a couple with one kid who make significantly more than us (more than double) - not sure about the extent of help from parents
- one is a couple with two kids who are having a tougher time (the father used to make more than us combined but makes less now and the mom stays at home) and had to use a trust fund left to them to stay afloat
- one is married couple with two kids who make more than double, who lived with their parents until recently, had medical/business school/undergrad paid by parents, and have also borrowed a bit of money (in addition to their savings) from family/parents to buy a house (they have currently have no childcare costs because grandparents take care of the kids)
- one is a married couple with one kid where the dad makes more than double what we make combined (has been in FAANG) and inherited money to purchase their home, though they'd obviously rather have their parents around

I am not saying this to downplay *my* privilege. I know I am. Many people my age who have kids and can live here tend to have some sort of family help, though I am sure I have the most. We're all lucky. (There are plenty of self-made/independent couples too.) If my husband and I had to, industry jobs would pay us 50% to 100% more, but we would rather not since government jobs are significantly less stressful and there's no overtime. We can choose this, again, thanks to my parents.

This area appreciated 20%-40% during 2021, so many people are shut out from purchasing unless they have a bit of money. A lot of all cash purchases too. I have no idea how, given that condos here are $950k to $1.2mil for older ones, $1.5mil for new ones, and small SFH are $1.7mil to $2.2mil, but I also also not a saver (as you will see).

##If you're still with me: SPENDING TIME

#FRIDAY- $172.50

8:00AM Husband gets my son, I get my daughter. I make a mocha oat milk latte at home with our espresso machine, and my husband makes omelets and slices fruit. He is WFH today but I took it off since my son is on break. 

9:30AM I take the kids to the local park to play. We run around on the jungle gym, gather pine cones, and talk about Christmas decorations. 

11:00AM We head home and the kids help me in our garden by digging up dirt as I set up the concrete blocks for planters. My mom surprises us with cherimoya and lemons. She's also here to kidnap the grandchildren for the day. Involved grandparents are the best.

12:00PM Husband and I eat leftovers from last night (Japanese A5 wagyu, potatoes, and broccolini). 

1:00PM I start a load of laundry and go to Ralph's to buy dried cranberries, mini marshmallows, two types of grapes, broccoli, potatoes, cilantro, shallots, eggplant, lemons, tomatoes, zucchini, raspberries, two kinds of tomatoes, ice cream sugar cones, chicken drumsticks, parmigiano reggiano, and goat cheese. **$86.27**

3:30PM My husband and I discuss taking down the Christmas tree (we look at the city's policy for tree pickup), but we don't do it yet. I switch the laundry to the dryer and hang a few pieces to airdry.

5:00PM For dinner, my husband roasted lamb, potatoes, and broccolini. He also made a compound butter (shallot, parsley, garlic, lemon). For dessert we have grapes - they're incredible and the kids finish the entire carton (one pound). 

6:30PM Before the kids get TV, my son and I sit down and he reads a book to me. It is a simple book that consists entirely of ""I am top cat. Am I top cat?"" on six different pages. My son can blend letters together so we have started teaching him how to read.

7:00PM The kids get 30 mins of TV (today my son picks Cars 3). They say good night to the TV and we play together until bedtime.

8:00PM We get the kids ready for bed. Our kids' bedtime routine is as follows: kids go upstairs, dad gives them both a shower, we brush their teeth, we read a little and play in my son's room. I take my daughter to her room and my husband puts my son to bed while I tuck my daughter in.

9:00PM After the kids go down, I buy a game on steam (Everholm) for **$11.99** and some earrings from Aliexpress (**$74.24**). I clean up in the kitchen/dining area.

10:00PM My husband and I hang out in our bedroom and fool around. 

11:00PM I get ready for bed (wash face, brush teeth, take out contacts). I should have a skincare routine but I don't. Maybe when the kids are older?

#SATURDAY - $79.11

8:30AM Husband and I get the kids up for the day. We have toast & fruit & a latte (for me). My makeup takes about two minutes (moisturizer, sunscreen, a single swipe of eyeshadow, and eyeliner).

9:30AM we head over to attend a holiday party at a friend's home. The hostess is fantastic. She set out activities for the kids (painting) and made a TON of food. The (six) kids played together. We have lunch (it is delicious.) She sends us home with a party bag (my daughter's has a new Tonie figurine, which my daughter immediately latches onto and listens to for the rest of the day). The host family and my family have known each other since our kids were around one. I met them at a local park, and we've been friends since. The two other families there include my friends (known the husband/dad since elementary school) and another couple with a son the same age as my son (the mom is a fantastic baker and always very careful of my daughter's anaphylactic energies). We all see each other once a week, sometimes more, since we often meet up at the park, do Halloween and Thanksgiving and Christmas events together, etc. 

I want to take a moment to really highlight that they are truly wonderful people. They are so brilliant, so kind, so thoughtful, so capable, just so amazing and I am so very grateful they are our friends. That's a lot of so.

1:00PM Kids napped and I get boba **$19.64** (espresso milk tea for husband, a milk tea for me, and a second tea for tomorrow morning). I stop by a grocery store and buy pasta and bags of discounted Twix, guilty pleasure. **$17.98**

2:00PM I wonder if I should buy a blowout brush since I do nothing with my hair. I put it on my birthday wishlist. I chop and deseed vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, sweet peppers, tomato, shallot) for dinner.

4:00PM After the kids are up from their naps, we go to the park. My son plays with another boy who happens to be two weeks older than him (I chat with the parents.) Venus is especially bright and I point it out to my kids. My son, who has 10000 questions about planets, ends our talk with ""I LIVE ON EARTH"" and runs off. My daughter loves the slide (and me), so all I do is run up and down the play area with her.

5:30PM For dinner, I make roasted vegetable pasta, a favorite for both kids (as there is a gratuitous amount of cheese) and a bit of leftover lamb. My son eats the eggplant! My daughter only wants pasta (but does try the vegetables). Dessert is more grapes. 

7:30PM The vegetable scraps are gathered and my kids and I go out back to our compost pile & bury them.

8:00PM I play with the kids in playroom, then it's bedtime for them.

8:45PM After putting my daughter in bed, I go to supermarket to pick up two cartons of the grapes they loved. I also buy ketchup, whole grain mustard (tomorrow's dinner requires whole grain and dijon), Worchester, chocolate chips for baking, green onion, ginger, and shallots. **$41.49**

9:00PM I get home, load the dishwasher, and hop onto WoW to play with my guild - we end up not raiding since most people are gone but shoot the shit while questing. I met them through a mom friend who suggested I join her guild (very understanding of parents). They're mature, respectful, fun, and casual. 

11:00PM: I log off and go downstairs to make raspberry jam with the lemons my parents brought. After I clean a little, I have yuzu sake and hang out with my husband (who is playing some persona-like game). 

12:00AM: Bedtime!

#SUNDAY - $42.50

8:30AM I wake up and take a shower while my husband gets both kids up for the day. 

9:00AM Kids have toast with butter and raspberry jam (I know, sugar), while my husband goes to buy donuts (uses a gift card for the order - $54 for a dozen) and we drive to a park to meet up with some of my friends I've known since middle school.  

9:30AM The kids play outside and eat broccoli, fruit, and donuts. I try to make a new friend for my daughter (there is another girl around my daughter's age), but the other girl is not interested so I stop. My friend bought coffee for everyone (hojicha latte for me and flat white for husband). She gifts us two books (my kids LOVE the books she's picked in the past), I gift her fancy hot chocolate (also hojicha flavored). My other friends give us a bag with toys (we do toy swaps with them since our sons are the same age). We talk a little about politics (we're upset), children, gamete donation, fostering, real estate, public/private school, and general financial investments. my two kids are with my husband, and i get to leisurely sip coffee and talk to other adults about ""grown up"" topics. 

I think how lucky i am that my parents sacrificed so much to subsidize my life (since we are talking about real estate). My friend (she's on the East Coast now and visiting for the holidays) says she would move back if her parents gave her a free house. 

1:00PM: Because we are at the park all day, we get MCD for kids and my husband. **$18.82** After we get home, I head out again to the farmer's market only to see it is closed (was going to get elote for lunch), so I pick up Korean fried chicken **$23.68** for myself while husband put the kids to bed for a nap. I eat lunch and chat with a friend, who is in the process of spring cleaning (winter cleaning)? He sends me photos of his ""junk"" (literally, cardboard boxes) and I marvel at how clean and organized a childfree home is. 

4:00PM After the kids' naps, we go to a park (regularly scheduled every Sunday afternoon with open invitation to three other families). 

5:30PM We leave to my parents' house (a minute away). I give them some of the jam I made. My parents spend time with my kids, and my husband and I sit on our phones. 

6:00PM We head home with food from my mom. I was going to cook but will punt that to tomorrow. We have fish, pork, chicken, mmmm.

8:00PM Bedtime for the kids.

8:30PM I wash the dishes and schedule our week out. I have Monday and Tuesday off, my husband has Thursday and Friday off, and Wednesday is a holiday. 

8:55PM I order stainless steel scrubbing pads, paint-your-own wooden vehicles, a dye-free scrub daddy, and a fluffy rolling elephant ride-on, which can swivel 360 degrees. That one is $40. The total cost is $66.88, but I use a gift card.

9:00PM I have a snack - lemon blueberry goat cheese with raspberry jam and toast

10:00PM I play Stardew valley while my husband plays Persona. He comes up a little bit before bedtime and we snuggle.

11:20PM bed for me.

#MONDAY - $482.05

8:00AM - We get the kids up. Breakfast consists of sweet pepper omelets and grapes. I buy yoga classes (**$120** for a $150 gift card, about five classes).

9:00AM finds me coordinating playdates with three different groups (neighborhood kid group, friend group, and school group). I am trying to figure out which sports class, climbing gym, trampoline park, and/or playground cafe we will be doing this week, in addition to visiting a regional park with a train. I settle on rock climbing tomorrow. I book the class but realize it was for the wrong time slot, so i call them and they're able to change it to tomorrow! **$68** for two people, one hour each. I make a note on my to-do list to do the waivers.

9:30AM My husband goes to the office, my mom picks up my daughter, and I take my son out for lunch. 

10:00AM We arrive at the mall, so I put our names down. My plan was to get soup dumplings. A friend spontaneously decides to join us (family of three, baby being almost half a year old). 

11:30AM We are seated. We eat, commiserate over how hard babies are, and I pay for lunch as a Christmas present to them. **$152.46** including tip. After the meal, I take my son on the merry go round **$2.00** and buy him a Lego set **$86.19**. The store gives me a small free set. We head home.

2:00PM We get home, I put my son down for a nap and get the laundry started. I load up Bridgerton and Stardew Valley.

3:30PM My son wakes up and we build Legos together (I build and he helps me find pieces). It takes 2 hours as he needs a lot of prompting, but I figure he will get better as he practices.

5:30PM I start prepping dinner. I make honey mustard chicken, parmesan sweet peppers, and cheddar smashed potatoes. I use up the last of the honey - this jar was orange blossom honey, but I will get buckwheat next. 

7:00PM My husband gets home with our daughter. We eat dinner, with grapes for dessert. My daughter is especially excited over this and demands the entire bowl.

7:30PM After dinner, I work with my son on his reading while my husbands works on the alphabet with our daughter. We play after.

8:30PM Bedtime routine. My kids have no issue going to sleep, so I am in and out of my daughter's room in five minutes (she tells me ""go away, byebye"" after I pull the blanket over her. Such attitude.)

8:45PM I buy a Hemlock & Oak daily planner for 2025. It's made in Canada, a beautiful and minimalist design. 20% off but shipping is $11 so total is **$53.40**. Will the planner fix my ADHD? No, but I buy it anyway.

9:00PM I play a little Stardew Valley.

11:30PM My husband comes to tuck me in, but he goes back downstairs to play videogames after.

#TUESDAY - $160.16

8:00AM We get the kids up. Husband makes breakfast and orders dinner **$97.94** for us (We eat sushi as our NYE tradition.) I set pickup for the afternoon. I have oat milk & cold brew. My husband takes my daughter to my parents and then work. 

9:00AM I get ready for rock climbing by finding my son a pair of sneakers that I bought a year ago that fit him now. My son plays independently for now so I file my nails and put on some makeup.

10:00AM We meet the other families at the rock climbing gym. Apparently I didn't need to buy a ticket for myself, and if I bought in person, the kid ticket is only $25. Oh well. It's very kid-friendly but my son hates it. *Hates.* I manage to convince him to try four walls and one slide, but he is absolutely done after. 

12:00PM One of the other families and I choose Italian for lunch. My son eats some pizza and spaghetti with meat sauce, and I eat his leftovers. I enjoy getting to know the other family. They're outgoing and we share similar interests (like boardgames and videogames). At the end of the meal, I venmo our share **$30** plus tax and tip to the other family, then head with my son to pick up dinner.

1:20PM I buy ikura for my son's dinner, though he tells me he wants butter chicken (???). I also buy jelly sake, potato chips (son's request), and baby puffs. **$22.23**

1:35PM: We are walking to the sushi place when my son says he wants ice cream. We are out of cones at home, so we walk over to the store and I pick up two boxes of sugar cones. **$9.99** I finally am able to pick up the sushi and head home.

1:45PM I tuck my son in for his nap, watch Beef, play a little SD valley, have a tiny bit of coffee, and fold clothes. SO. MANY. CLOTHES. I swear I do two or three hampers a week.

2:00PM I make hummingbird water and hang the feeder outside. My parents text me and ask for paper plates.

3:30PM My son wakes up. I do some dishes as he cleans up his playroom, and we head out to the park. 

5:00PM We swing by my parents' house to pick up my daughter. I give my parents the plates and wait for my husband so we can carpool back home. 

6:00PM My husband arrives and we head home for dinner. Rice & chicken from last night for my daughter, ikura and rice for my son, and toro & yellowtail handrolls for the adults. We offer our kids our food but they decline. 

7:00PM Some friends message me to see if I am free tomorrow morning for a walk. We decide on a local trail.  

7:30PM The kids are allowed to watch fireworks on TV AND have a juicebox (normally only for birthday parties) and a tablespoon of ice cream each. I only know this because we are basically out of ice cream and there's barely any. I make mini cones and give each kid one. They are beyond ecstatic. Ice cream AND juice in one night?! 

8:00PM We play with legos (my daughter and I play with duplo), we read some books, and the kids are put into bed. 

8:45PM My husband and I begin drinking. I have a sake jelly and my husband pours some champagne for us. 

11:30PM We prepare for bringing the new year in with a ""bang."" yes, I made that lame pun up years ago and it's been our tradition since (sushi & that). We snuggle then I brush my teeth and go to bed.

#WEDNESDAY - $142.34

9:00AM Wow I am up late. I find my husband has gotten the kids up and picked up breakfast from a local Taiwanese cafe. **$37.12** He gets me an osmanthus oolong milk tea, which I put in the fridge for later, and a pepper beef breakfast sandwich. He also stopped by 85C for buns. **$24.45**

9:30AM We head to the trail and meet up with my friends. My son insists on biking, while my daughter wants her scooter (that lasts all of two minutes, so my husband and i take turns carrying it). I catch up with my friends, the kids run around happily, and the two miles ""hike"" (flat, paved sidewalk) passes by easily, though at the end my daughter wants to be held. The day was warm - even though it said it was 51F, it felt like 80 in the sun. My friends invite us over for lunch, so we pick up McD for all the kids **$19.97** and head over. We normally don't get fast food this often, because my son eats at school (we pack lunch and it's much healthier) and my daughter eats at my parents'. Still, with the holiday rush, it is what it is.

12:00PM My friends make clam soup, galbi short rib, okra, bok choy, and rice. Yummm. We talk (they are thinking of upsizing and have a tax question) and set a playdate in two days, so we can treat them back for lunch.

1:30PM My daughter is overtired by the time we get home for her nap and I stay with her for 20 minutes to stroke her hair. She eventually calms down and falls asleep. I leave after I am sure she is asleep. I usually don't do this, but kids need flexibility. 

2:30PM I drink the tea from earlier and head out to buy gas. It is **$60.80** for 13.7 gallons, which gives us around 550 miles for our hybrid SUV.

3:00PM I make playdate plans with another family for the afternoon at the park. I try to have my kids outside every day for two to eight hours whenever we can. It does mess with my ability to clean or do household chores, but my husband and I are on the same page and will take a little mess in exchange for our kids getting to run around outside. 

3:30PM I finish Beef while the kids are sleeping, drink my tea, and enjoy the relative silence. It is wonderful. My husband is downstairs, gaming.

3:45PM The kids wake up but my daughter is screaming and in a terrible mood. I hug her while I wait for her to calm down before I pick her up and take her downstairs. It is okay for her to have big feelings and be angry, and I am here to comfort her, but we need to behave before we continue with our day. 

4:00PM While the kids are having a snack (fruit), I prep dinner (throw a bunch of ingredients in the instant pot). My friend texts me that her kid is still napping so it'll be just us this time. We head out to the park.

5:30PM We head home. I made chicken potato soup in an instant pot. My husband boils udon noodles (two minutes). The kids eat a ton, especially the udon. They then have a plain sugar cone, Japanese potato chips, and green & red grapes for dessert. After, we play in the living room.

8:00PM Bedtime routine. They're both very giggly, verging on overtired, so I breathe a sigh of relief when my daughter goes to bed with no issue. 

9:00PM I go downstairs and eat a chocolate croissant from 85C. I then do laundry while watching Always Be My Maybe and log into WoW to look at the month's new trader post offerings before picking up the weeklies.

10:00PM My husband comes up and we have bonding time.

11:00PM We talk about the kids. A lot of reminiscing about when they were babies (they are still babies to me). 

12:00AM I brush my teeth, apply tretinoin since I am working tomorrow and won't be in the sun, and go to bed.

#THURSDAY - $369.58

7:00AM Why am I awake this early? Maybe my body knows today is a work day? I get ready for the day (put in contacts), scroll IG for fifteen minutes or so, make a coffee, and throw laundry into the wash.

7:30AM I am WFH. I log in for work , check my emails and do my timesheet.

8:00AM I hear my husband get my son and daughter up, so I text my parents that my daughter is awake. 

9:00AM I go downstairs to make myself breakfast - mocha latte & toast. I find cookies in the diaper bag (from my friend yesterday) and take my loot upstairs to eat while I work. I love sugar. Most people can't tell because I'm underweight, but my diet would be 90% sugar water (full sweetness milk tea, flavored lattes, coconut water, matcha) if dental work wasn't so expensive. I already have three dental implants.

9:30AM My mom comes to get my daughter, and my husband takes my son to the regional park, which boasts both a train and a zoo on site. They use tickets I purchased earlier in the year (10 tickets for $60). $12 total but is prepaid. I keep working. It is quiet but I have a lot of emails.

11:00AM A friend texts me about a free preschool pass deal for sea world. I log in and buy two. I check out the price of tickets for my husband and I. We can either buy single day tickets for $70 each (cheapest), or an annual pass for $102 each, which includes 50% off parking. The annual pass is on a $8.50/month with 0% APR offer, which to me seems like the better choice as long as we go two or more times in the year. I text my husband to ask how he feels about it. He says yes and I pay **$17** upfront. I immediately text a bunch of local friends about the deal.

11:15AM Back to work. so. many. emails. They're not important but i read them all anyway because honestly it is the day after a holiday, no one is online, and no one needs me. 

1:00PM My husband and son get home. I go downstairs to greet them. He tells me he pet a snake and a possum at the zoo (**$4** for zoo tickets) and rode the train. Very exciting when you are three. I grab peach sparkling water and pop the morning laundry into the dryer. My husband ate with my son at the park ($23 total) asks me what I want. Even though I want curry, it's $17 and I usually go there on lunch dates with my husband. I pick a $4 cheeseburger from In n Out.

1:30PM I tackle admin work and start sketching out a plan for technical work.

2:50PM My husband comes home with burgers, fries, and some alcohol (he took a detour)**$13.68** and **$67.10** respectively. I take a 10 minute break to eat.

3:30PM My son is up, so my husband takes him grocery shopping. They go to Costco (**$122.25**) and Ralphs (**$122.25**). At Costco, they get sparkling water, oxtail, beef tongue, sweet peppers, and pasta. At Ralphs, celery, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, oat milk, eggplant, zucchini, two types of cheeses, basil, pasta, and vanilla ice cream.

4:10PM I get off work. My King Arthur package is supposed to arrive today and I am planning on making make snowflake crisp (taiwanese nougat) and chocolate chip milk bread, along with broccoli & cheese pasta for dinner. However, when I check, the package has been delayed five days. I need milk powder to make the baked goods, so none today.

5:00PM I start dinner. The recipe takes 15 minutes after the water boils, so the meal is done quickly. My parents drop my daughter off.

6:00PM There's too much lemon juice in the pasta (I didn't measure and juiced directly into the pasta) and it's sour. Neither kid eats much, so my husband eats most of it. My son, who loves broccoli in any form, is not down with the melted cheese on his and refuses to eat his vegetables.

6:30PM We don't force them to finish anything, ever. After the meal the two devour a carton of sweetest batch strawberries while watching 30 mins of tv.

8:00PM Straightforward bedtime.

9:30PM I get a hankering for brownies. I loved boxed brownie mix, so I always keep a box handy. I add espresso powder, natural cocoa powder, vanilla extract, sub the water out for milk, use melted butter, and add an extra egg yolk. While the brownies bake, I fold laundry.

11:00PM: I eat a brownie and start cleaning the dishes and the rest of the kitchen. This week has been an anomaly with cooking - my husband usually cooks 100% of the dinners, which I prefer because he never cleans up after (regardless of who cooks). To me, it's fair if he cooks and I clean, not fair if I do both, especially since I am also stuck with laundry duty and we do two to three hampers a week (the folding and sorting and hanging drive me insane). After, I head back to fold more clothes.

12:00AM: My husband starts cooking his oxtail recipe for tomorrow's lunch/dinner. He comes upstairs and watches me finish laundry, then we cuddle and talk about tomorrow's plans. I brush my teeth and go to bed."

WotR and female empowerment in anime - short form,Rings_Of_Power,1hskma6,2025-01-03 06:39:45,0,0.22,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rings_Of_Power/comments/1hskma6/wotr_and_female_empowerment_in_anime_short_form/,metoo77432,,"Long form here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Rings\_Of\_Power/comments/1hrn32j/war\_of\_the\_rohirrim\_and\_why\_using\_anime\_as\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rings_Of_Power/comments/1hrn32j/war_of_the_rohirrim_and_why_using_anime_as_a/)

I got a lot of requests for a TLDR version of this post, so here goes.

1. Anime is a genre of animation in the same way that American cuisine is a genre of food.  This is a key point, because animation translates differently in different cultures.  Anime is specifically animation originating from Japan, with commonly accepted Japanese characteristics, which may vary from studio to studio like it does here in the US.  A lot of people disagreed with this point and got rather pissy about it, and like I said repeatedly in the other post they're definitionally wrong here.  WotR is anime, and the example that someone else brought up, ""Blue Eyed Samurai"", is not.
2. Japan's affinity for American style feminism is close to zero.  If someone tried to reenact some of the shots from this clip of Kill la Kill, currently streaming on Disney+ (NSFW) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAnQAHL-KOI), here in Texas they'd be arrested and sent to jail on a felony charge for 6 months to 2 years and potentially becoming a registered sex offender (https://www.nealdavislaw.com/criminal-defense-guides/texas-improper-photography-law/), mainly for invasion of privacy and lack of consent concerns. If it involved minors like depicted in Kill La Kill, charges become far more severe and entail child pornography, which here in Texas is a ""3G"" offense on the same level with murder and sexual assault among other crimes (I really can't believe this is airing on Disney+) (https://www.nealdavislaw.com/sex-crime-lawyer/child-pornography/).  By contrast, in Japan, there's an entire industry dedicated to taking pictures of minors in bikinis or less (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior\_idol).  The idea here is that Japan has wildly different sensibilities as to what is appropriate behavior around women, particularly in mass media.  I brought up other examples from Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell in the long form post for those interested in exploring this further.  For those who think the clip is ""normal"", I'd challenge you to find anything currently on Disney+ with similar content originating from America.
3. Anime is going to depict Japanese sensibilities for females and not American sensibilities.  WotR depicts Hera in a typical anime girl fashion, in this case hourglass figure wearing something resembling lingerie into combat, which strongly resembles the sexualized depictions found in Cowboy Bebop, which for lack of a better term I will label as sub-genre ""teen+ anime"".  Conversely, ""Blue Eyed Samurai"", because it was an American production, will depict American sensibilities.  Comparing the two for the purposes of discussing anime is invalid, like comparing sushi to hamburgers and wondering why no one is pouring ketchup on their sashimi in Japan.
4. Female empowerment entails viewing women as more than just sex objects.  Hera's depiction and how it strongly resembles other anime sex objects becomes problematic.
5. Kenji Kamiyama, the main animator for this movie, works primarily on Ghost in the Shell, once viewed as an icon of feminism in anime.  The creator of that IP, Masumune Shirow, now draws exclusively pornography, so Kamiyama hails from a legacy of a failure of female empowerment in anime.
6. Given the above, using anime for WotR becomes extremely problematic for the intended depiction of female empowerment via Hera.  From the trailer, that seems to be a primary purpose for choosing this particular protagonist.  I already think anime in general and Tolkien don't mix - too much cultural disparity, should be an English or American studio or some other FIVE EYES country doing the animation - but given this added dimension of female empowerment which is almost a foreign concept in Japan, it becomes borderline toxic.

Personally I don't think this post has nearly as much detail as needed to make the argument.  If you believe the same, I refer you to the long form.

I'm going to ask if you disagree, please be civil about it.  If you're not interested, just move on.  No one is forcing you to read this.  For those who are interested, hopefully this can result in an constructive discussion about how confused the decision making was for WotR, and potentially how that could also translate to confusion in the decision making behind Rings of Power and Tolkien properties in general in recent years.

Currently WotR is bombing in the box office, having made barely half of its small $30 million budget.

sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a
terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful
prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower
for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek

that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like
that? That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's
amazing what you did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess,
you don't entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have
in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You try to give them a hint and they
won't leave. And then there's that big occurred silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can
I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't want to go back there. You don't
how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick
together! You got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. -But one night only. -Huh, thank you! A,
what are you do... No! This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories. And in
the morning... I'm making waffles. Where do I sleep? Outside! Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know, I
don't know you and you don't know me... ... so I guess, outside is best for me. Here I go. Good
night. I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside. Sit by myself outside, I guess. I'm all
alone, there's no one here beside me. -I thought, I told you to stay outside. -I am outside. Well
James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have? It's not... What a lovely bed. -Got
you! I found some cheese. Awful stuff. -Is that you Gordon? -How did you know? Enough! What are
you doing in my house? Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table! Where would we supposed to
put her. The bed's taken. What? I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre! What do I
have to do, to get a little privacy? Oh, no! No, no! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get
out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go. And hurry up, hurry up. No, no, not there. Not
there! Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them. Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What? We were forced
to come here. -By who? Lord Farquaad. He ??? All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Oh I do. I know where he is. Does anyone else know where to find him? -Anyone at all? -Me.
-Anyone? Oh pick me, I know! Me, me. Ok, fine. Attention all fairy tale things! Do not get
comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up. In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right
now and get all off my land and back where you came from. You. You're coming with me. All right.
That's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city
adventure. I love it. I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again... What did I say about
singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Well, can I hummer? -All right. That's enough. He's ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. You monster. I'm not
a monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world. -Now
tell me! Where are the others? -Eat me. I've tried to be fair to you, creatures. Now my patience has
reached its end! -Tell me! Or I'll... -No, no, not the buttons. Not gumdrop buttons. All right! Who's
hiding them? Ok, I'll tell you. -Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man? -The muffin-man.
-Yes, I know the muffin-man. Who lives on Proully lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin-man.
-The muffin-man! -The muffin-man! -She's married to the muffin-man. My lord! We found it. Well
then, what are you waiting for? Bring it in. Magic mirror. Don't tell him anything! Evening. Mirror,
mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? Well, technically, you're not a
king. A..., felonious. -You were saying. -What I mean is a... ...you're not a king, yet. But you can
become one. All you have to do, is marry a princess. Go on. So, just sit back and relax my lord,
because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are. Bachelorette
number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and
hottubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters. Please
welcome... Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.
Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy. Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find
out what a live wife she is. Come on. Give it up for... Show-white. And last but certainly not least.
Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing ????, dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot
boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina Coladas and getting
cut in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona. So will it be, bachelorette number one?
Bachelorette number two? Or bachelorette number three? -Two... -Three! -Two! One. No, no, no.
Three. Pick number three my lord. Ok, ok. Number three. Lord Farquaad. You've chosen... princess
Fiona. She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone... But I probably should
mention little thing that happens at night... -I'll do it! -Yes, but after sunset... Silence! I will make this
princess Fiona my queen. And Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain! Assemble your finest
man. We're going to have a tournament! That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc. I've told you I'll
find it. So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle. Aha, that's the place. Do you think maybe he's
compensating for something. Hey, hey wait up Shrek! -Hey, you! -No, no! Wait a second. Look, I'm
not gonna eat you. I just... It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? Hey look at this. Wow! -Let's
do that again. -No. no. All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom. Sorry about that. That
champion should have the honor, no, no... ...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess
Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first
runner up will take his place. And so on, and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm
willing to make. Applause. Let the tournament begin. What is that? Ugh, it's hideous. Oh, that's not
very nice. It's just a donkey. Indeed. Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named
champion. How about him. Oh, hey. Now, come on. Can't we just settle this over a pint? No? All
right then. Come on. Hey Shrek! Let me, let me! The chair! Give him the chair! Thank you. Thank
you, very much. I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel! Shall I give the order sir? No. I have a better
idea. People of Duloc. I give you our champion! What? Congratulation, Ogre. You've won the honor
of embarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp
back! -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairytale creatures. Indeed. All
right Ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me and I'll give you your swamp back. Exactly
the way it was? Down to the last slime covered toast tool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone.
What kind of quest? Ok, let me get this straight! We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess
just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with
full of freaks on the first place. -Is that about right? -You know what? Maybe there is a good reason,
donkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?
You know, ??? . Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick. Oh, you know
what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate. Got a knife, cut
open their spleens and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? A, no, not really, no. For
your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think. -Example. -Example? OK, A-a-m,
Ogres are like onions. -They stink? -Yes, no. -O, they make you cry. -No. Oh, you leave them out on
the sun and they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs? No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres
have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. O, you both have layers. You
know not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers. I don't care
what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else everyone likes? Paffe. Have you
ever met a person and you say: ""Hey, let's get some paffe"" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is
delicious. No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden. Ogres are like onions. End of story.
Bye, bye. See you lather. Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. You
know I think I've preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I'm making a
mess. Just the word paffe has made me start slimying Why, Shrek, did you do that? Man you got to
warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was opened and everything. Believe me
donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone. We must be getting close. Yeah, right,
brimstone. Don't be talking ??? brimstone. I know what I smell and ??? no brimstone. And they
don't come of stone neither. Sure it's big enough, but look at the location. Oh, Shrek, remember
when you said that Ogres have layers? Oh, yeah. Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't
have layers. We wear ??? sleeves. Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I
mean. -Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs. No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a
rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava! Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok? For
emotional support. We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time. -Really?
-Really really. Ok. That makes me feel so much better. Just keep moving and don't look down.
Don't look down, don't look down. Shrek! I'm looking down! I can't do this. Just let me off right now,
please. -But you're already half way. -Yeah, but I know that half is safe. Ok, fine. I don't have time
for this. You go back. Shrek, no, wait. Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh. This? -Yes, that!
Yes, yes. Do it. OK. -No, Shrek! -I'm doing it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.
That will do Donkey, that will do. Cool. So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her. I was talking about the dragon Shrek. -Are you afraid? -No, but
shhhhh. Oh, good. Me neither. Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Here's a...,
something responsible of the situation. Not to mention dangerous situation. And there's dragon that
breathes fire. I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I
mean. I'm sure he's heavier than a cow... Donkey. Two things. Ok? Shut, up. Now go over there and
see if you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess. The princess will be
up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. What makes you think she'll be there? I read it
in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs. Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???.
That's right. Those stairs won't know which way they go. The drafting stairs, ??? Don't mess with
me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs. I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd
step all over it. Well, at least we know where the princess is. -But where is the... -Dragon! Donkey,
look out! Got you. Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white sparkling teeth. You probably hear
this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you
got there. And do I detect the hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're a girl
dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon, 'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty
out. What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye? Man, I'd really love to stay,
but you know I'm a asthmatic and I don't know if we would worked out. You'd be blowing smoke
and stuff. Shrek! No, Shrek! Shrek! -Wake up! -What? Are you princess Fiona? I am. Awaiting a
knight so bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice. Now let's go. But wait, sir knight. This be our first
meeting. Should not be wonderful, romantic moment? Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time. Hey, what
are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet. Out through the window and down
the rope by to your valued steed. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Uh-um. But we
have to sing through this moment. You can residing of a poem to me. A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti.
Or something. I don't think so. Well, can I at least know a name of my champion? Shrek. So, Shrek.
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Thanks. -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's
not my job to do this. Now, come on! But this isn't right. ??? That's what all the other knights did.
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame. That's not the point. Wait. Where are you going? Exit is
over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. ...rush into a
physical relationship. I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude. That was
the word I was looking for. Magnitude. Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you
doing? Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time. I mean, we really should
get to know each other first, you know what am I saying. As friends, maybe even as ??? Hey don't
do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail. And you're going to tear it off.... Oh, no. No! -It
talks?! -Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick. Ok, you two. Head for the exit. I'll take care of the
dragon. Ruuuuun! You did it. You rescued me. Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ... ...a little
unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt. And where
would a brave knight be without his noble steed. I hope you heard that. She called me a noble
steed. She thinks I'm a steed. The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight. -Aah,
no. -Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer. Oh, no, you
wouldn't, dust. But, how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in a job description. -Maybe it's a
perk? -No. It's destiny. You must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a
dragon is rescued by a brave knight. And then they share true love's first kiss. With Shrek? You
think, wait... ...you think Shrek is your true love? Well, yes. You think that Shrek is your true love.
What is so funny? Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok? Of course you are. You're my rescuer. Now,
now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm
not going to. -Take it off! -No! -Now! -Ok, easy. As you command your highness. You're an Ogre.
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not
supposed to be an Ogre. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok? He's the one,
who wants to marry you. Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me? Good question. You should
ask him that, when we get there. But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some Ogre and
his pet. Well so much for noble steed. Look princess. You're not making my job any easier. Well I'm
sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me
properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? -I'm a delivery
boy. -You wouldn't dare. -You coming donkey? -Put me down! Yeah, I'm right behind you. Put me
down or you will suffer the consequences. This is not dignified. Put me down. Ok, here's another
question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you"
Hell’s Kitchen Atlanta episode 6,HellsKitchenFanFics,1hs2f9s,2025-01-02 14:43:20,3,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/HellsKitchenFanFics/comments/1hs2f9s/hells_kitchen_atlanta_episode_6/,Ok_Measurement482,,"Previously on Hell’s Kitchen…

All the chefs made a special menu for Andi and Brice’s wedding anniversary, with the red team beating out the blue team thanks to Chris’s great leadership and Meghan’s communication failures. For their reward, the red team got to enjoy a day at the Atlanta zoo and an overnight stay at a 4 Seasons suite. For their punishment, the blue team had to set up the dining room. This caused some problems between Keith and the rest of the team, as he confronted both Meghan and Jasmine about losing, blaming them for it. However, he also confronted Tianna, with them getting into an argument about who was better. However, they managed to finish and got some sleep before the service the next day. The next day, both teams were prepping the menu, with the red team being confident and the blue team being nervous. However, Devon spilled some oil on the floor, resulting in a freak accident where Maddy slipped and broke her leg. This resulted in her having to leave the competition, prompting Chris and Jordan to rally the team before service. During service however, Devon had a terrible night, called off by him serving food off the floor, which Ramsay was never going to accept, eliminating him right then and there. After this, the red team rallied and had a pretty flawless service afterwards. Over in the blue kitchen, while Keith got the team off to a strong start, his communication wasn’t very clear, resulting in Cam getting off to a rough start. This poor communication carried into the night, as Meghan had trouble on meat and it carried into the rest of the kitchen, as Cam was off all night because of it. However, it was Meghan’s raw chicken that was the last straw, getting them all kicked out. This made Ramsay call the red team in to finish the blue team's service, with them finishing it flawlessly. Ramsay praised Chris for his performance, saying that he was easily the best of the night. For the blue team, Ramsay named Keith best of the worst, asking him for the 2 nominees. Up in the dorms, Keith was adamant about his nominees, choosing Tianna and Cam. However, Ramsay chose Meghan instead of Tianna as the second nominee. In the end, Ramsay swapped Meghan back to the red team, not eliminating anyone else. 

And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…

Ramsay told all the chefs to get some sleep. They all left, with Meghan saying in a confessional that she was happy that she had another chance, but she wasn’t fully confident that she could capitalize on it. As they got back to the dorms, Tianna and Keith went out to the patio, with them having a fight about who could cook better and their time left in the competition. Meanwhile, the rest of the chefs were all inside, with Leo deciding that they needed to loosen up after such a bad day. He decided that he would try and crack some jokes, making them about everything and anything. The most well received ones were him imitating Ramsay and repeating some of the insults he’d told people here. This made everyone laugh, with even Keith smiling and having a good time. Jasmine said in a confessional that Leo was a funny guy, and she couldn’t help but enjoy being around him because of that. Cam said the same thing in a confessional, saying that Leo would be someone he hired to work for him, not just because he was a talented chef, but he was also a fun guy that could make work more fun. After Leo cracked his last joke, all the chefs got some sleep, knowing that it would be a busy day tomorrow. 

The next morning, all the chefs were up and getting ready, with Leo being happy go-lucky and humming and dancing this morning while he made breakfast for himself. However, that was getting on Keith’s nerves, as he told Leo to shut up and settle down, as they didn’t need to hear his annoying humming this early, saying that he was just being purely annoying. Leo told him that he wouldn’t tolerate being treated like garbage, saying in a confessional that he didn’t understand why Keith hated him so much over absolutely nothing. Keith told him that he didn’t give a fuck whether Leo would tolerate it or not, because he wasn’t going to listen to any of this shit anymore, so he better shut up or he’d regret it. This made Leo mad, with him saying that he didn’t understand the problem he had with him, but he didn’t want it to get physical, so he said he would stop. This made everyone angry and annoyed, with both Chris and Jasmine telling Keith that he was being unreasonable towards Leo, as he was only being cheery, not being in his face happy or loud and annoying, as he was simply humming to himself. Keith was pissed at then, telling them that he didn’t give a fuck about their opinions, saying that they could go fuck themselves. This made them walk off, with Jasmine saying in a confessional that she was so over Keith’s bullshit, and she couldn’t wait to get him either out of Hell’s Kitchen, or off her team because she couldn’t handle much more of his shit before she snapped. However, Tianna wasn’t done with Keith’s shit, telling him that she was pissed about the way he acted, telling him straight to his face that he was a joke of an Executive Chef and it pissed her off that people like him got those jobs when there were hundreds of other people more deserving than he was that didn’t get the job because of him. This made Keith extremely angry, as he told Tianna that he didn’t know where she got off saying that, but she didn’t have any right because she was literally a private chef and has nothing to do with working at a restaurant whatsoever, so she could suck his dick. This shocked everyone, as they didn’t expect him to go that low and say something like that to her. Tianna didn’t take that though, telling him that she wouldn’t do anything of the sort and she would make sure she outlasted him, even if it meant she had to do everything she possibly could. Just as they were about to get physical with each other, both Joe and Jordan stepped in, separating the pair of them and telling them to cool off. As they separated, Michelle called the dorms and called them all downstairs. Cam told everyone that they were needed downstairs right away, telling Keith and Tianna to put their differences aside and not fight in front of Ramsay. They both grudgingly agreed, but they said that they wouldn’t work together whatsoever. 

As the chefs lined up in front of the pass, Ramsay greeted them all, saying that today's challenge was one of his favourites, saying that they would all be competing in a head to head fusion challenge. Michelle and Alex brought out a wheel with 9 different cuisines on it. They were Indian, French, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Spanish, Thai, Greek, and Japanese. Leo said in a confessional that this would be a fun challenge, especially with some of the wacky combinations that he could get and prove himself. Ramsay said that they would choose their partners, and each chef would spin the wheel. He first asked Joe who he wanted to go against, with him choosing Napoleon. Ramsay called them both forward, asking Napoleon to spin the wheel. As he spun, he said in a confessional that he didn’t want Indian at all, since he hated spicy food, and that was the spiciest of all cuisines he’s had before. As the wheel finished spinning, it landed on French, making both of them happy. Joe then spun the wheel, saying in a confessional that he was hoping for either Mexican or Japanese, as those were 2 cuisines he was very familiar with and he knew he could make work with French. However, as the wheel finished spinning, it landed on Mexican, making them both even more happy. Ramsay remarked that they just got a great combination with so many amazing options. He then asked Meghan who she wanted to go against, with her saying Keith. He said in his confessional that he would easily blow her out of the water, and it wouldn’t even be close. As he spun the wheel, it landed on Japanese, making Meghan cringe, saying in a confessional that she didn’t know anything about Japanese cuisine except for sushi, and she wasn’t going to serve that to Ramsay. As she spun the wheel, it landed on Spanish, making Keith very happy. Next was Cam and Jordan, with them getting Italian and Japanese, making them both happy. Next was Miguel and Tianna, getting Thai and Indian. Jasmine and Chris were next, getting Mexican and Greek, leaving Claire and Leo as the last pair, with them getting French and Chinese. Ramsay told them all they had 45 minutes to make a stunning fusion dish, saying he wanted to taste both cuisines equally. 

All the chefs rushed into the kitchen, with the blue team getting to work right away. Joe said in a confessional that he already had some ideas in his head about what to do, and he knew his dish would be delicious. Keith said the same thing, but he also said that Meghan didn’t stand a chance even more, as he’d been to both Spain and Japan, so he knew the cuisines quite well and would wipe the floor with Meghan. As they all started cooking, Miguel was having trouble making a dish, as he didn’t know how to make a dish that was equal parts Thai and Indian, as Indian cuisine could be very  overpowering and he needed flavours from both, not 1 cuisine. While they were working, all the chefs were happy with the choices they got, except for Meghan, who was constantly complaining to everyone about getting 2 cuisines that didn’t make sense together. This was getting on the nerves of her team, especially Claire, with her telling Meghan to shut the fuck up and cook, because she got 2 really easy cuisines to make a great dish, so she didn’t really give a shit about her whining. Meghan was pissed at this, saying in a confessional that she didn’t expect people to be such assholes about it. Jordan said in a confessional that he didn’t need to listen to all this nonsense complaining, as that was something that he expected came with someone like Keith, who was an immature 26 year old, not a 40 year old executive chef. Ramsay then called out the last few minutes, making all the chefs hustle to get everything on the plate. However, Meghan realized that her chicken was raw, making her throw it in a pan to get it cooked properly. He then started counting down the last few seconds, making all the chefs rush to finish their plates and get them on the pass. 

All the chefs lined up in front of the pass, with Ramsay telling them that joining him today was someone who was a master of fusion, saying that the ‘father of fusion,’ Norman Van Aken would be joining him to judge the dishes today. All the chefs applauded as he entered the room and joined Ramsay. Joe said in a confessional that he was super excited and nervous to have Norman Van Aken taste his food, as he really was the ‘father of fusion.’ Ramsay told them that he wanted Cam and Jordan to bring their dishes forward first. He asked Cam what he made, with him presenting his lobster ravioli with a miso sauce. They both said that the dish looked very pretty, saying that you could put it on a wall with how pretty it was. As they tasted it, Ramsay and Norman both raved about it, saying that they would both serve it in their restaurants. Next was Jordan, who presented his Japanese dumplings with Italian sausage and a soy broth. They both tasted it and said that it was delicious, and they could taste both cuisines together in harmony. Ramsay then asked Norman to pick which one was better, with him saying that they were equally good, but he had to give it to Cam because of the presentation being absolutely amazing. Both chefs thanked him, with Jordan saying in a confessional that he couldn’t believe Cam beat him again, as he was not 0 for 2 against him. 

Next up was Joe and Napoleon, with Joe presenting his steak and frites with a mango salsa, saying that the steak was seasoned like it was when he had one in Mexico. Both of them said that the steak was perfectly cooked and the seasoning was absolutely delicious. As for the sides, they said that the fries were great, and the chimichurri was good. Napoleon then presented his shrimp tacos, beurre blanc sauce, with haricots vert. They both said that the tacos were great, but the sauce made them soggy, and the haricots vert were slightly undercooked, with them saying that Joe easily got the point, making the score 2-0 for the blue team. The next pair was Keith and Meghan, with Meghan presenting her Spanish style chicken with miso eggplant and chorizo. Both of them said that the dish was amazing, as the combination was an odd one, but it was great, and the taste was amazing. Keith then presented his curry rice paella with shrimp, mussels, and scallops. Both judges tasted it and had multiple critiques for him, saying that the dish was under seasoned and didn’t work. However, the biggest insult to Ramsay was that the rice was undercooked and chalky. Norman agreed, but he said that he didn’t like the presentation of the dish because it looked like someone just threw up on the plate. This left Norman with an easy choice, choosing Meghan’s dish over Keith’s, making the score 2-1 for the blue team. Keith said in a confessional that they were both wrong, as he always cooked rice perfectly and his presentation was on point for a dish like this. 

Next up was Leo and Claire, with Leo presenting his French style fried rice, with him using duck instead of chicken, and he used sautéed beans and carrots. Both of them raved over the dish, saying that the rice was amazing, and the seasoning was on point. Claire then presented her 5 spice tuna with a cucumber salad and mushroom duxelles. Both judges liked the dish, saying that the tuna was seasoned nicely and the cook was amazing. Ramsay then told Norman that he had to pick his favourite, as they were both exceptional. He told Ramsay that he couldn’t, saying he would give them both points, making the score 3-2 for the blue team. The next pair was Jasmine and Chris, with Chris presenting his gyro style tacos with pork. Ramsay said that they looked quite elegant, despite them being tacos. Norman agreed, saying it looked very pretty. As they tasted it, they both said that while the presentation was great, the taste was pretty mediocre. Jasmine then presented her souvlaki skewers with mango salsa and Greek salad. They both liked the taste of it, but the presentation was pretty sloppy, saying that it looked like something someone just threw on the plate. Jasmine said in a confessional that she didn’t think it looked that bad, but it is what it is and she had to live with it. Ramsay then asked him to choose one to get the point. However, Norman said he couldn’t choose one because they were both not up to par. Ramsay agreed with him, telling them he was disappointed. This made the last pair Miguel and Tianna, with the red team needing to get the point to tie it. Miguel went first, presenting his Thai shrimp and curry. Both of them said that the seasoning could use a bit of work, as it was pretty hot, but other than that it was pretty good. Tianna went next, presenting her Thai style paneer with butter chicken. Both of them said that the dish was quite pretty, saying that on presentation alone you could make a huge profit. As they tasted it, both chefs seemed to enjoy it, with them both saying that it was the best dish of the day. Norman easily awarded the point to the blue team, giving them the win 4-2 over the red team. Ramsay thanked him for coming, saying that he couldn’t wait to see him again. All the chefs thanked him as well, applauding as he left. 

Ramsay congratulated the blue team on winning, saying that they were in for a fun day to get some anger and frustration out, saying that they would be going axe-throwing and then enjoy a nice lunch at Kimball House restaurant. Tianna said in a confessional that she was excited, as she’d heard great things about that restaurant and couldn’t wait to eat there. Ramsay then told the red team that their day was going to be less fun, as they would be in for delivery day, with him telling them that they needed to unload all the trucks and restock both the kitchens and the front of house, saying that they would hear a truck horn when their deliveries were here for them. He then told the blue team that there was something waiting for them in the dorms, telling them to hurry up and get going. As they got up to the dorms, they found a Vitamix blender for each of them. Leo was visibly pumped, saying in a confessional that he was super happy that he got a Vitamix, as that was one of the things he really wanted to take home from Hell’s Kitchen, saying that a black jacket was another goal he was really hoping for, and he needed to push himself to achieve that. As the blue team left, the red team was already unloading things, as a truck full of ice had just arrived with a bunch of it. They all left, with Keith taunting them and telling them that it sucked to lose, and he was happy they did. Meghan told him that it also sucked to not get a point, shutting Keith up pretty quickly and making him leave in a huff. This made Napoleon laugh, with him saying in a confessional that making Keith annoyed and angry seemed to be something that everyone liked to do. As they were unloading the ice, Claire signed the invoice before looking at it, making them unload all the ice. This made Michelle annoyed, as she told them that they didn’t need all this ice, saying that she wanted to see the invoice. Claire handed it to her, and Michelle said that they needed about half of what they got. This made Jordan run out to catch the truck, telling them that they unloaded too much and asked if they could come back. The driver was annoyed, but he agreed to come back to let them reload stuff back on the truck. As he got back, they reloaded what they didn’t need into the truck, with them apologizing about holding the driver up. As they finished, Jordan told them that they needed someone to read each invoice and make sure they had the things they needed and didn’t unload too much. Claire instantly took that role, saying in a confessional that she wasn’t here to throw her back out or injure herself, she was here to cook. 

While the red team figures out their delivery issue, the blue team is enjoying their reward. Once they got there, Ramsay joined them, saying that there was a special prize for the best axe thrower of the bunch. Joe said in a confessional that he was not a sporty individual, so he didn’t expect to do good, let alone win. As they started, Leo was doing well, hitting multiple bullseyes in a row. However, Jasmine managed to match him, saying in a confessional that she loved to go axe-throwing with her friends back home, so she’d be embarrassed to lose. In the end, it came down to the pair of them, with Leo winning the competition. He said in a confessional that he was excited to see what the reward was, as Ramsay always has a good reward for winning things. Despite him winning, he congratulated Jasmine, telling her that he was surprised he won from how experienced she seemed. As they enjoyed themselves, Keith was visibly annoyed, bringing down the mood of everybody. This made Tianna tell him to relax and get over the challenge, as they should be enjoying themselves, not being angry about the challenge. Keith said that was easy for her to say, as she got the point and he didn’t. Cam said that it wasn’t a huge deal, as Jasmine also didn’t get the point and she wasn’t sulking about it. Keith laughed at this, saying that he deserved his point, and Jasmine’s dish was the worst of the bunch while his was the clear best. Joe scoffed, making Keith annoyed and asking him what he was annoyed at. Joe said that he clearly needed a lesson on how to listen, as the judges had multiple criticisms about his dish today, so he didn’t understand how he thought it was ‘good.’ This pissed Keith off even more, with him telling Joe that he needed to learn when to back off, because he was crossing the line. Joe decided to not engage, telling Keith that he was entitled to what he thought and he walked away. Keith seemed to accept this, and went back to axe-throwing by himself. Cam was annoyed by this, saying in a confessional that he really didn’t like Keith’s attitude, so he had to do what he could to get him off the team, even if it meant playing dirty. 

Back in Hell’s Kitchen, the red team was busy unloading things, with Jordan being especially careful about what they were unloading, as he didn’t want another ice fiasco. Despite this, the red team was working very efficiently, as they were consistently getting everything unloaded and stocked quickly. However, complications arose when Claire didn’t pay attention to the invoice, giving halibut carcasses to them instead of the fillets. This made Michelle annoyed, as she told them that they couldn’t do anything with the carcasses during service tomorrow. This pissed Chris off, making him tell Claire that if she was going to sign the invoices and check the orders, then she needed to actually check them and make sure they were right. Claire blew him off, walking away and muttering about him. Chris walked away, going over to start doing something else. Despite this, the red team finished the deliveries and all went to relax. Meanwhile, the blue team was enjoying their lunch at Kimball House. All the chefs were enjoying the food, with Joe being especially pleased with the quality, saying in a confessional that he loved having good food, and he would definitely be visiting this place again. As they finished up, they all headed back to Hell’s Kitchen to get some sleep after a long, but rewarding day. 

The next morning, all the chefs were up early and went down to the kitchen to start prep for the day, with the blue team being very synchronized and seemed to be ready for dinner service. Even Keith wasn’t causing trouble, which was getting prep done much faster than usual. However, the red team wasn’t as fast, with Meghan being lost about what to do. This pissed Jordan off, with him telling them that there were 5 stations that needed to be set up and only 4 were being worked on, so she needed to get the other one done. Meghan said that she wasn’t used to this kitchen, so she didn’t know where everything went. Napoleon told her that she literally started in this kitchen, so he didn’t understand what changed over the past few weeks of her with the blue team. She said that they did everything different, so it was hard for her to grasp what they were doing over here. Miguel was annoyed, saying that she needed to figure her shit out or she would be gone next. This flustered Meghan, with her saying in a confessional that she didn’t want to go yet, and she had really hoped they would be understanding about this. Despite her thoughts, nobody was understanding about her being lost, with them all giving her the cold shoulder. Meghan was both flustered and distraught about this, having to leave to compose herself. This left both Chris and Napoleon to pick up her slack, which they were both unhappy about. Chris said in a confessional that he didn’t understand how she was an executive chef somewhere, let alone in Hell’s Kitchen still, if she didn’t understand how to prep desserts, which was literally the easiest thing to prep in the entire kitchen. 

Despite this tension among them, the red team managed to get their side prepped in time, with Ramsay greeting them and telling both teams to line up. He told them that the last service was way below par, telling them that he wanted a complete service by both teams. Jasmine said in a confessional that she couldn’t believe how much the red team had fallen off since her and Leo had left, but she couldn’t dwell on that because she was on the blue team now. Ramsay then told them to all get on their sections, telling JP to open Hell’s Kitchen. 

The sections for the blue team were Jasmine and Joe on apps, Cam on meat, Tianna on fish, Leo on garnish, and Keith on desserts. For the red team it was Napoleon and Chris on apps, Claire on fish, Meghan on meat, Miguel on garnish, and Jordan on desserts. 

As the tickets started coming in, the red team was already struggling, as Claire was behind already because she forgot to drop lobster for the risotto. This made Chris annoyed, saying in a confessional that he didn’t understand how half of his team was full of idiots who didn’t understand times and what to do in the kitchen. However, despite his annoyance, the first table managed to make it out, with Chris telling Claire that she needed to listen to his times or someone was going home tonight. Claire agreed with him, saying in a confessional that she hasn’t been on a section by herself yet, so she was finding it difficult to keep up with everything. Despite her struggles, the red team was managing to send appetizers out. Over in the blue kitchen, they were off to a better start, as Jasmine was coordinating with Tianna to get appetizers out quickly and efficiently, with them moving onto entrees pretty quickly. As they moved onto entrees, Cam took control quickly, assuming the role of verbal leader by calling times for everyone. Leo was happy, saying in a confessional that Cam’s voice was like a lion’s, and you could hear it over everything in the kitchen, as he was loud and proud most of the time. With Cam leading the way, the blue team was sending their first table of entrees to the pass, with Ramsay accepting it and praising Cam for his perfect cooking. Cam thanked him, saying in a confessional that he was happy he was bouncing back so far, but he couldn’t get ahead of himself yet since it was still early in service. Despite their early success, Tianna sent overcooked salmon to the pass, making Ramsay tell them to all touch it. Jasmine was annoyed, showing disdain on her face. Leo said that it was overcooked, with Ramsay smashing the fish and telling them to restart. Tianna was visibly upset, saying that she couldn’t believe she fucked this up, as she knew she was on thin ice. Despite this, she fixed the salmon and got the blue team back on track. 

Over in the red kitchen, they had managed to get all the appetizers out and moved onto entrees, meaning that Claire, Meghan, and Miguel would have to coordinate to get the entrees out. However, Miguel was struggling to communicate what was needed, causing confusion amongst them. This made Ramsay annoyed, telling them that they needed to figure their shit out, telling them what they needed on the order. This finally got them on track, with Meghan and Claire both getting the first table to the pass. However, Meghan’s chicken was raw and her Wellington was overcooked, and Claire’s salmon was raw and her halibut was overcooked. This made Ramsay angry, telling them that they managed to fuck everything up like they were a bunch of amateurs. He told them to restart, telling Miguel that he needed to lead the team. Miguel said that he would, but he didn’t have much confidence, saying in a confessional that he didn’t think he had the respect of the rest of his team, so there was no way he could lead the team. This definitely showed, as Miguel went quiet when everyone was asking him for how long till they went to the pass. This made Napoleon go over and take over garnish, telling everyone that they were all going to the pass in 6 minutes. He asked Miguel what he had on fire, as they needed to get going. Miguel said that he had nothing on fire, since they had to refire everything. Napoleon was annoyed, telling him that he should always have stuff going, not just one table at a time. This caused him to push Miguel aside, saying that he didn’t need them to fall even further behind because of his failures tonight. Miguel was annoyed, but he didn’t do anything, prompting Ramsay to come over and tell him that he needed to fight back and not lose control of his section. Miguel attempted to try and fight back, but Napoleon would only let him do a few things, not work the entire station like before. However, that wasn’t the only problem, as Meghan was confused about what was going on and brought her proteins to the pass, making Ramsay rush the rest of them to get their stuff to the pass, making Claire send raw halibut to the pass. This made Ramsay annoyed, as her halibut was also complimented by overcooked chicken from Meghan, making Ramsay tell them that they need to learn to communicate with each other, saying that this was their last chance. While the red team tried to get back on track, Cam was driving the blue team, pushing them closer to the finish line with his perfect proteins. Ramsay told him to keep this up, saying that this was their last ticket. Leo told them 3 minutes, with them all agreeing and getting the food to the pass together. Ramsay accepted all of it, telling them to clear down, praising Cam for his performance on meat. 

Over in the red kitchen, Meghan fucked up once again, sending raw steak and cold Wellington sauce, making Ramsay pull them all into the storage room. He told them that he gave them one chance to redeem themselves, saying that Claire finally sent perfect fish, only for it to be ruined by the steak, revealing multiple strip steaks that were still raw. Jordan was pissed about this, saying in a confessional that steak was the easiest thing to cook in Hell’s Kitchen, so if she was fucking that up, then she had to go. Ramsay told them to get out, saying to communicate with each other and come back with 2 nominees. As they left, Ramsay called the blue team, saying all of them except for Keith needed to follow him into the red kitchen and finish their service. Jasmine said in a confessional that as much as she liked winning, she wanted more competition than the red team was providing, as it felt like they were just that much better than the red team. As they took over the red kitchen, Jasmine and Cam both took the leadership roles, completing their service for them and ending the night positively. Up in the dorms, Chris and Jordan were pissed, saying that they couldn’t believe that they didn’t finish service again, as it felt like a daily thing of losing people on the team because they weren’t good enough. Jordan said that he was going with Meghan and Miguel as his nominees, saying that meat went down hard, and that if it wasn’t for Napoleon taking over, garnish would’ve collapsed. Miguel said that Claire struggled all night, so he was going with her and Meghan, as they needed properly cooked proteins to get through service, and they weren’t providing those during service tonight. Napoleon agreed, but he said that Miguel just backed right off when he took over garnish, saying that he didn’t even see him afterwards. Napoleon said that he was going with Claire and Miguel as well, with Chris agreeing. This solidified that Miguel was going up, with them having to decide between Claire and Meghan. 

As the red team lined up, Ramsay told them that tonight was painful to watch, asking Jordan for the nominees. 

“The first nominee tonight is Miguel. He basically disappeared and was a non-factor during service tonight. The second nominee is Meghan. She couldn’t do anything right tonight, and I personally believe that if you can’t cook steak, then you shouldn’t be here.” 

Ramsay said that he appreciated the nominees, but said he wanted to hear from one more person, calling Claire up with them. He told them that he wanted all of their jackets, as they all screwed the kitchen tonight. He first asked Miguel why he should stay in Hell’s Kitchen. 

“I should stay because I know I’m not done here. I can get better, and I will show you that I will get better.” 

Ramsay told him that he needed a head chef now, not in 15 years. He then asked Claire the same thing. 

“I should stay in Hell’s Kitchen because I have the passion and the drive to get better. This is not my best, and I’ll show you that I can be better.” 

Ramsay told Meghan that he’s heard enough from the other chefs, and her failures tonight proved to him that she wasn’t ready for this position yet, asking for her jacket. As she gave him her jacket, he told her that she was a nice girl and experienced, but experience was only good if you used it properly, wishing her well. As she left, Ramsay told both Miguel and Claire to get their shit together quickly, telling them to get back in line. 

Elimination quote: 

“As I leave here, I know I could’ve done better, but I’m just happy I made it as far as I did. Tonight was a bad service, but it should have been Miguel out here, as he disappeared tonight while I took the brunt of my mistakes on the head. Good luck to the red team, you’ll need it.”

"30 [M4F] #Detroit #Michigan - To be incredibly pretentious, I'm looking for a mutual muse...",ForeverAloneDating,1hrt65h,2025-01-02 08:01:04,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1hrt65h/30_m4f_detroit_michigan_to_be_incredibly/,platonic-idea,M4F,"This could take many forms, and I'd rather not be overly-prescriptive at this point, but wouldn't it be nice to find someone who inspires me as much as I will, hopefully, inspire them? Someone with which to explore. A relationship/partnership in which we feel alive and energized. The fullest and truest expression of ourselves as individuals connected to the larger world. Realistic? Probably not. Romantic? Absolutely.

I have varied interests including creative projects like photography and writing. I'm a big fan of movies (Film, even 🧐), reading, fitness, getting outside when the weather allows, sushi, and pizza. I'm 5'7"" and far from a gym bro but I try to stay active and, at the absolute peak of my self-confidence (after a few bourbons), I've said to myself ""Yeah, you'd fill out a Spidey-suit pretty well."" (Embarrassing! What am I even talking about?) 

What you should know: My degree is in design but I have a pretty boring office job. I'm introspective, considerate, and try to remain empathic. I'm an introvert but I'm not shy. I've got the Big D (depression) but I'm working on it. I value real conversation.

What I'm looking for: Someone local to metro-Detroit. Someone who shares at least some of my interests and/or is interested in exploring, growing, and learning. Someone who also values good conversation, intimacy, and creativity. 

If any of this sounds interesting to you, please shoot me a chat with a fun fact about yourself. I'm happy to swap pics early (but no pressure)! 

Talk to you soon!

Half way through the Taste,hobart,1hq73ku,2024-12-30 23:48:22,34,0.89,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hobart/comments/1hq73ku/half_way_through_the_taste/,TassieBorn,,"Eating at the Taste every day is an after-Xmas indulgence for my family. Thoughts on this year’s offerings:

* As usual, very variable value for money – Jianbing was great, wallaby taco was not. Sushi was delicious but expensive.
* I like the stools, although they’re inclined to migrate from table to table. We usually find a table which one of us guards while the others head off to find food and drink, then swap. Outside, I love watching little kids bopping along to the music.
* The table reserved for people with disabilities was poorly signed. Unless you sat right at that corner, you probably wouldn’t have seen it. (This was the one in the main hall – if there were others, I didn’t notice them.)
* There don’t seem to be as many share platters as in previous years.

I do miss the days when there were more food and drink related events – cooking demos, talks etc."
11 days in New York - What are your thoughts on my itinerary?,AskNYC,1hptlb4,2024-12-30 13:19:17,0,0.5,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1hptlb4/11_days_in_new_york_what_are_your_thoughts_on_my/,Loud_Ad_6153,,"Hello everyone!

My boyfriend and I (25 yo & 28 yo) are visiting New York City for the first time this April and are staying near Times Square for 11 days. We have breakfast included at the hotel but plan to eat out for some breakfasts and all other meals.

We enjoy a mix of sightseeing and relaxing. As foodies, we love trying different cuisines, but tend to favor casual, mid-level restaurants over fine dining. Our food budget is $50-100 per person per day. We're particularly fond of pizza, burgers, sushi, asian, Italian, steaks, and Mexican food, but we're also open to must-try NYC spots. For sightseeing we don't have a specific budget, a mix of free and cost activities.

Here's our itinerary so far. We'd love feedback on must-try dishes or better food alternatives to those listed, activities we should add or swap, and suggestions on how to fit everything in without feeling too rushed.

Where To Buy Base Crypto,cryptocurrency777,1hobm30,2024-12-28 13:18:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency777/comments/1hobm30/where_to_buy_base_crypto/,cashchampionchannel,,"Effective Strategies for Where to Buy Base Crypto Safely and Securely
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Buying base crypto might seem daunting, but with the right strategies, you can do it safely and securely. Whether you are a novice or an experienced trader, understanding where to buy base crypto is crucial. Here are some effective strategies to help you navigate this process.

### Choose Reliable Exchanges

One of the first steps in purchasing base crypto is selecting a trustworthy exchange. Here are some characteristics to look for:

- **Security Features:** Check for two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage options, and insurance policies.
- **User Reviews:** Research user experiences through forums and review sites to gauge the exchange's reputation.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure that the exchange complies with local regulations to reduce risks.

Some popular exchanges where you can buy base crypto include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Always research to ensure they accept your local currency and have the trading pairs you need.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Consider Decentralized Exchanges

If you prefer more privacy and control over your assets, consider decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Here’s why they can be a good option:

- **Control of Funds:** You keep your private keys without needing to trust a centralized party with your crypto.
- **Less KYC:** Many DEXs do not require extensive personal information, allowing for more privacy during transactions.
- **Wide Variety:** DEXs often have a broad range of lesser-known tokens available for trading.

Popular DEXs include Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap. However, be cautious and ensure the DEX has a good reputation and liquidity.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Utilize Peer-to-Peer Platforms

Another method for buying base crypto is through peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. Here’s how to navigate this choice:

- **Direct Transactions:** You can buy crypto directly from other individuals, which allows for more flexibility in payment options.
- **Local Payment Methods:** Use local payment methods that suit you, such as bank transfers, PayPal, or cash transactions.
- **Escrow Services:** P2P platforms often provide escrow services to ensure the safety of both buyer and seller during the transaction.

Some popular P2P platforms include LocalBitcoins and Paxful. Always check the seller’s reputation and review user ratings.

### Invest in a Wallet for Security

Once you purchase base crypto, keeping it secure should be your top priority. Here are some wallet options to consider:

- **Hardware Wallets:** These are physical devices that store your crypto offline. Examples include Ledger and Trezor.
- **Software Wallets:** Mobile and desktop wallets provide a good balance of security and accessibility. Trust Wallet and Exodus are popular choices.
- **Paper Wallets:** For those who prefer offline storage, generating a paper wallet allows you to store your crypto without an internet connection.

Regardless of your choice, always back up your wallet and protect your private keys.

### Stay Updated on Market Trends

Keeping an eye on market trends will help you decide the best time to buy base crypto. Here are a few strategies:

- **Use Market Analysis Tools:** Websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko provide real-time data to help track prices.
- **Set Price Alerts:** Use apps to receive notifications when a cryptocurrency reaches your desired price.
- **Follow Crypto News:** Staying informed about news and developments can give you insights into market movements.

Engaging with the community through forums like Reddit and Twitter can also provide valuable information from seasoned traders.

### Educate Yourself and Practice Caution

Always educate yourself about the latest trends and techniques in the cryptocurrency space. Participating in online courses or attending local meetups can expand your knowledge significantly. Remember to:

- **Start Small:** Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, especially when you're starting.
- **Verify Transactions:** Double-check all details before confirming a transaction to avoid costly mistakes.

By incorporating these strategies into your approach, you can buy base crypto safely and securely. You’ll feel more confident in your decisions, ultimately leading to a better trading experience.

Understanding the Different Platforms for Purchasing Base Crypto: A Comparative Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to buying base crypto, you have several platforms to choose from. Each platform has its own benefits and drawbacks, so it’s essential to understand what each offers. Below, we’ll explore different options available for purchasing base crypto to help you make an informed decision.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Centralized Exchanges

Centralized exchanges (CEX) are probably the most popular platforms for buying base crypto. These platforms act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, providing a user-friendly interface for cryptocurrency trading.

- **Coinbase:** Known for its ease of use, Coinbase allows beginners to buy and sell a variety of cryptocurrencies. Its user-friendly platform is perfect for newcomers in the crypto world. However, it does have higher fees compared to some competitors.
- **Binance:** This is one of the largest exchanges in the world. Binance offers a vast selection of cryptocurrencies and trading pairs. The trading fees are relatively low, making it a great option for more experienced traders.
- **Kraken:** Kraken is known for its security and has various features like futures trading. It might be less beginner-friendly than Coinbase, but it offers advanced tools that cater to growth-oriented investors.

### Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) allow users to trade directly with each other without relying on a central authority. This provides greater anonymity and control over your funds.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Uniswap:** A popular DEX that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. You can trade Ethereum-based tokens directly from your wallet. However, you need to handle gas fees, which can fluctuate significantly.
- **SushiSwap:** Similar to Uniswap, SushiSwap also allows for trading Ethereum-based tokens. It has additional features such as yield farming, making it an attractive option for more experienced users.

### Peer-to-Peer Platforms

Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms connect buyers directly with sellers. This method can sometimes offer better exchange rates but comes with increased risk due to the lack of regulation.

- **Paxful:** This platform offers a large variety of payment methods for purchasing Bitcoin, from bank transfers to gift cards. However, users should complete their due diligence when choosing sellers.
- **LocalBitcoins:** A service that connects buyers and sellers across the globe. While it allows for various payment methods, the users must always prioritize safety by checking seller ratings.

### Mobile Apps

With the rise of mobile technology, many crypto exchanges now offer mobile applications that allow you to buy base crypto directly from your smartphone.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Binance App:** The app retains many features from the desktop version and allows for on-the-go trading without losing functionality.
- **Coinbase App:** Its mobile app mirrors the website's simplicity, making it convenient for beginners to manage their portfolio.

### Buying from Brokers

Online brokers offer a straightforward way to purchase cryptocurrencies. They typically allow more direct transactions with set prices, similar to trading stocks.

- **eToro:** eToro is a social trading platform that lets you buy crypto alongside traditional stocks. It has a user-friendly interface, making it ideal for those just starting. However, the lack of true ownership of assets might be a drawback for some.
- **Robinhood:** While primarily aimed at stock trading, Robinhood also supports cryptocurrencies. However, this app does not allow withdrawals or transfers of crypto to other wallets, which could limit its appeal to some.

Buying base crypto can be straightforward if you choose the right platform for your needs. Each type of platform comes with unique features. It's essential to consider your preferences regarding user experience, transaction fees, and security before making a decision. By understanding these options, you can effectively navigate the complex landscape of cryptocurrency and find a service that works best for you.

### Conclusion

Finding the right place to buy base crypto involves considering safety, security, and the right platform for your needs. By implementing effective strategies, you can ensure that your investment journey begins on solid ground. Start by researching and choosing reputable exchanges that prioritize user safety. Look for platforms with robust security measures, such as two-factor authentication and cold storage for assets, to protect your investment from potential threats.

Remember, conducting thorough research and comparing your options will not only save you time but can also help you avoid common pitfalls in the crypto marketplace. Keep an eye out for emerging platforms and developments within the crypto space, as this industry evolves rapidly.

A leagues review from a guy,2007scape,1hnrxx9,2024-12-27 18:21:02,0,0.47,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1hnrxx9/a_leagues_review_from_a_guy/,Jertharold,:leagues-badge: Leagues,"Hey there. We are a little over half way through leagues and I wanted to give a review. I will preface this by saying everyone's enjoyment of the mode is their own and that my review is by no means invalidating that opinion.

Personally I loved this league more than any other league we have had in the past, but I still think there are some very obvious flaws that everyone in the community can agree on or maybe disagree on. 

I loved this league so much i started a second account to try out some of the other areas my main did not get to go through! 

This brought me through Fremmy > Asgarnia > Mory on my main and Tirannwn > Wildy > Fremmy on my alt. My main went 3-6-1 for combat masteries and my alt went 5-0-4 (I am planning to do the inferno on it soon). My best friend and I talked about relics before leagues landed and I knew how I was going to build day 1 on my main. This brought me to Animal Wrangler > Dodgy Deals > Clue Compass > Reloaded (Freindly Forager) > Clue Arbiter > Banker's note > Grimoire > Guardian. After finishing these on my main I wanted to again try some new things on my alt going Animal Wrangler > Dodgy Deals > Clue Compass > Golden God > Slayer Master > Banker's Note > Grimoire > Last Stand.

My experience on my main was fantastic, I got to the 8th relic and T6 ranged during the second week of leagues and have been slowly working my way to dragon since then (roughly 53k points and climbing). Up until I got to about the 35-40k mark of points was the game truly enticing and fun (for me personally) and drove me to continue the adventure! After the 40k mark it has slowed down a lot. Many of the tasks need me to get a drop that I am simply going dry for or to do content that is simply unfun (one example I have seen mentioned here on the reddit by others is Abyssal Sire for both of these categories). 

My alt has had a VERY different experience in the league not only starting so late but because I took melee masteries and new regions. Starting late made many of the experiences my main had both better and worse. There were far fewer people to compete against in the early parts of the league making points incredibly easy to gain, I didn't even unlock my first two regions before getting my 5th relic. But it also made the later parts worse as competition was already geared up with full masteries and relics. 

Good things about this league:

\- Goal oriented systems that push you to do things you normally wouldn't

\- Increased rate of EXP gains to match the fast paced mode

\- Interesting cosmetic rewards

\- New or enhanced play styles

\- Fixes from the previous league to this league

\- An engaged community for things like raids

\- Combat Masteries allow for more player customization

\- Mega rare vouchers are awesome!

  
Bad things about this League:

\- Kandarin was butchered by many of the decisions made for relics and item drops

\- Tasks are still deeply dysfunctional (The number one for League Points has tasks they literally can't do still)

\- PvP serves no purpose in the Wildy area other than being an asshole

\- Many of the regions get over looked due to the new echo items that were added

\- Last Stand still makes soul wars and other pvp experiences boring.

\- Echo Items are interesting but go against the design philosophy that they stated during the teasers before leagues.

\- Many Relic have no real impact or are just lesser versions of their counter parts.

\- Echo bosses don't match the difficulty rank given to them

\- RNG is only so fun

How I would suggest fixing or improving these issues:

1. Kandarin should have received the Fremmnik echo items or at the very least not a mage only item. This would have been much more impactful than the what we got as Fremmy ALREADY provided incredible rings for players to obtain through DKs but also Duke for a mage ring. This is further butchered due to items dropping completed if they require other regions (rancor as one example). While I think this is a good addition as many items are locked out normally, many of kandarins only real draws were removed thanks to this and relics like grimoire. They should also consider the content offered in this area during the time between this league and the next to focus on adding new content to this large section of the map that is lacking in so many ways.

[Melee and ranged don't need this at all](https://preview.redd.it/vi6ehxy51h9e1.png?width=305&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bd019a24ff3e890bba7bb33b1cefb7633e315e)

2. An overhaul of the task system and list really needs to be done going into the next league. Every task handed to me should be doable without strange work arounds (see necromancer + asgarnia). They also need to make tasks interesting and not insanely repetitive, in Mory MANY of the high point tasks are ""Equip X piece of gear"" and then followed by ""Equip the full set of the same piece of gear""(Barrows, justiciar, etc). This isn't interesting, either require the full set or single piece not both. There are also boring RNG tasks like Eel sushi from the cave goblin minigame that should see changes at they are just noob traps for incredibly low points. They also need to really focus on reducing the clue scroll points. The day before Leagues 5 landed one of the mods on the stream said that clue points were reduced this time around, but it did not feel that way at all.

[This is too much for a task](https://preview.redd.it/gtcx6sziog9e1.png?width=385&format=png&auto=webp&s=59bf2f0db7f12286cc35ff9b5767e7716b7da026)

3. Just turn off PvP in leagues (with there being areas for people to fight each other like clan wars or bounty hunter or something). The reason people still don't want to take Wildy as a zone is because they don't want to deal with jerks killing them for literally 0 gain. Not to mention it just means you have to spend 45 seconds to a minute regearing because someone decided to Kopesh spec and one shot you when you weren't paying attention. If PvP wasn't enabled players would have been way more willing to take Wildy. Also if your argument is risk vs reward, there is no risk in leagues as everything goes to lumby if you get PKed and Death can retrieve it in a PvM death. This could be further improved by just having private instances like GWD for the bosses in the Wildy. 

4. While Kandarin is the most obvious of the overlooked regions due to not having an interesting Echo boss/item, but also lacking in a large way for normal content. Many of the other regions get over looked based on your masteries in combat. Taking Mage? no real reason to take wildy(maybe dagonhai?) or Tirannwn. Doing ranged? Well with 100% hit chance might as well go for tank armor instead of masori. Regardless Echo items really shoe horned a lot of players into picking specific regions that can be seen in the video updates Jagex has been doing along the way (less than 8% of players taking wildy kandarin) 

5. Not much to say here other than please just turn this relic off, it slows the game down and makes it just a slug fest. Personally unfun, but maybe yall enjoy it, I really don't know.

6. When Echo items were being announced and discussed by Jagex they made it sound as though these should be alternatives but not the best possible thing for you as a player for each slot. But in many cases they were BiS for me. Gloves of the Damned from Mory are just better than any other glove on my main as Barrows gloves are unobtainable. The Fremmy neck and ring? Are you joking? There is nothing in game better and you put out 2 of these items that stack together! Realistically jagex should have applied a similar item typing like the ring in neck in all regions. Every echo item should be enticing for all player combat styles. The wilderness shouldn't offer a 1 shot on other players with Kopesh as it removes any skill from player fights, but the shield was perfect for leagues. The Crystal Blessing should have worked for mage too and given ranged stat boosts so it could be used with the crystal or web weaver bow. At the end of the day they shouldn't have had weapons other than Nature's Reprisal (from kourend) and instead focused on making the echo items interesting choices for the players to truly augment your experience in combat.

[Why take this as a mage? or even ranged as it takes the ammo slot](https://preview.redd.it/35tztkvy0h9e1.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ffbd507024d6321473f1416bc463d7dadea2ebb)

7. The Relics that really shined this league were Clue Compass, Banker's Note, and Last Stand. With over 90% of the player base taking them and for good reason: 

7a) I only need ONE teleport directly to a bank! Shilo Village was that, this means the entirety of Bank Heist lost its value to a single TP from the compass. I can add a fairy ring to my house thanks to Zeah being in the base offered areas so why would I need fairy's flight? Outside of these issues as long as the teleports get me around the world decently the rest can be supplemented with existing teleports in the game already (Further supplemented with Grimoire or regions with new spell books). I hope that for the next league they scrap Fairy's Flight and Bank Heist and create new ones that maybe TP you directly to many bosses in game ""Boss Brawlers Bangle"" or a TP for Skilling that TP you to tree. fishing, hunting, mining, etc locations ""Gathers Guide"" These are not only more interesting but also allow players to further tailor their experience to what they want to do! Also see back to point 2 about the clue compass, thanks to it taking you where you need to go it earned you hundreds and hundreds of points many times more quickly than the other options.

7b) Just give banker's note the treatment last recall got in Leagues 4 and make it a tier reward. The problem Banker's Note has caused is that it has caused strategies to be formed around it, Sotetseg maze being ignored by spam eating and Verzik being face tanked instead of using pillars. This means players without it really struggled as groups might even just ignore/kick them. It would be fun to see something like Improved banker's note (if banker's note was made a guaranteed like suggested). that lets us use noted food directly as food and train skills like Runecrafting by just using noted essence, or Firemaking with a tinderbox on noted logs. It is leagues, let it be goofy fun.

7c) Last stand was taken too far this time around, its previous version just exploded around yourself and instantly set you back to full health and prayer. The new version is insane offering invulnerability for multiple seconds AND 255 in stats (rapidly decaying). Even if it just gave you one or the other it would have been a massive improvement from the last league, but with both there is little to no reason to take specialist or guardian (even though I personally have been enjoying guardian!) The fix for this I feel is make last stands undying effect the passive for the final tier (deativated in PvP) and then have the tier 8 relics augement the effect in some way. Guardian and Specialist could keep their base effects but maybe during the death window make the guardian super empowered attacking every tick at everything in range with typeless attack s and have specialist instantly refill your spec bar and double your spec damage/effects? This would make them more competitive with the 255 in stats plus remaining effect of a potion when it ends on the current last stand.

[New](https://preview.redd.it/i5ji78sksg9e1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=787db44508a45877b07744b4c7d78b01abd2f41c)

[Old](https://preview.redd.it/ru5d1nvisg9e1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ee400938cf683286bbed3dfeea1959e8aae6ff3)

8. Echo bosses were both really fun and very much a let down in many instances. 

8a) I think Corrupt Hunnlef (Echo) is a good example of this (I did it without Tier 7 or 8 of relics) because it doesn't allow things like banker's note or melee masteries to really shine (Look at the wiki and you will see every single guide says to do CG with ranged and mage and then just kick once if doing 5:1) This is due to the halberd and movement in general not functioning the way it should. First and foremost the entire reason of using halberds is to be one tile away with melee, but if you are running it will ignore this and sometimes put you next to the boss instead of a tile away. This is a base game issue that Jagex needs to adjust as when using halberds it should really try and put you in their ""Intended"" range. Following this because you don't get to abuse things like banker's note the CG was harder for me to do than echo DKs (which has the same rank of master) because I could just eat forever and figure things out in a pinch with more supplies. The ""jankiness"" of Corrupt Hunnlef (Echo) also shines as the boss would occasionally summon its first tornado next to the door meaning you would have to wait for it to pass, the boss itself would stand on the entry door for over a minute sometimes, and for some reason Jagex didn't start us with the dagger in hand when we need it to deactivate the prayer and have to swap to it every single pull when it should really just be in my hands.

8b) Echo KBD was also a real let down (ranked Elite) as I was easily able to complete it with sub 70 combat stats on my melee alt. The mechanics were just ""Keep moving and no body dies"". Maybe this was their intention, but it would have been nice to see KBD really shine and have something more engaging than ""RUN B\*\*\*H RUUUUN"" as the entire fight design. Compare this to Echo GG where I can adjust the difficulty by killing the adds that spawn or not (yes I know there are safespots players have found now), KBD just forces me to kill the adds and once I got the shield drop I could just ignore his mechanics anyways.

9. I have said this many many times in my life when it comes to gaming, there is a limit to how interesting RNG is when doing things. This is a limited time mode and really should have a garunteed KC at which you will be done with everything. Sure part of OSRS is RNG loot drops, but this is a limited time mode that is ironman only so I can't even trade it to someone else. 

9a) Make it so after 500 KC I have everything (minus the pet). ""But that's too easy"" some might say, yes but knowing it isn't something i will have to do forever? In a limited mode? This makes myself and others more interested in continuing grinds we otherwise have no interest in. I have 300+ duke KC and have not seen any of the other axe pieces besides his base axe piece. Am I going back to duke? Yes, but because of RNG I don't want to do him for awhile now. If it was garunteed that in the next 200 KC I would see everything, I might even just go back now and knock it out.

9b) There are a few bosses that players can ""Mass"" like The Nightmare and Nex, Why is the drop rate on these kills so low just to see ONE piece of gear drop (that that player might not even want) when there are hundreds of players in that room? Either make it so the boss drops a SINGULAR piece of gear every single kill with 20+ or even 50+ players in the room or have a different system that lets players work up a currency to buy a piece from the bosses loot table, hell make a counter part relic to Golden God like Lord of Loot that adds this to the league for players who don't want to do 200 kc to see one thing they need. This also balances out because if there are 100 players and the boss has 5-6 items it would on average take all 100 players roughly 500 kc to see all the loot drops!

  
I would enjoy talking to yall about what you agree or disagree with in my post as game design is one of my favorite conversation topics! And again this is my own view point, not yours. Maybe I am unhinged and don't even know it.

TL;DR Leagues 5 is/was super good!! But there is room to improve and make the next league even better still!"

"34 [M4F] anywhere - Contrarian AuDHD nerd who prefers to refer to his symptoms using the less commonly known descriptor ""Highly Sensitive""",ForeverAloneDating,1hn92hd,2024-12-27 01:43:33,0,0.33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1hn92hd/34_m4f_anywhere_contrarian_audhd_nerd_who_prefers/,GreenCurryinaKlaypot,M4F,"Retired future poker player, current nomadic uncle, aspiring intentional liver.

In an even earlier lifetime, I was a data scientist and quit my corporate job to play poker. But then, I realized all I did was swap my corporate treadmill for a competitive-gaming exercise bike, and that I hadn't actually solved the incongruence of driving to the gym and taking the elevator to get on an exercise machine to work off all the processed foods I stress ate. So now I'm walking outside instead, constantly checking how much longer it'll be until I've reached my step goal for the day.

(To be clear, this is all strictly a metaphor. I've never actually been motivated to go to the gym consistently; I have a very high metabolism that tricked me into thinking I was healthy even when I wasn't. And I now believe health to be a lifestyle rather than a checklist, so the part about the prior paragraph that wasn't just metaphorical was the part about enjoying outdoors activities--especially those with boat-like apparatuses. Also, my metaphors may need work).

In case the past few paragraphs were extraordinarily confusing, I quit my corporate job as a data scientist in 2019 and spent the next few years studying (running programs/developing strategies/memorizing decision trees) and playing poker because I wanted to see how good I could be at something that better matched my skillset. At the same time, after becoming aware of how much my achievement mindset had driven my life for so long and how I no longer wanted that, I've decided that poker will likely just be a way for me to offset costs going forward and not the primary focus of my life. So I've become interested in traveling and seeing the world, and I was on an roadtrip across the US (primarily through National Parks and secondarily through art museums) for 2 years from the fall of 2022 to the fall of this year. I spent September of this year in Peru and absolutely loved it, so my intention for the foreseeable future is to take more international trips. I tentatively am planning to go to Europe next summer and take a long cruise afterwards around Africa to SE Asia.

Longer term, I know that I'll likely want to be geographically flexible or nomadic. I'm not sure for how long I'll want to travel and/or if I'll eventually want to establish a more permanent base. I'll likely be interested in having children at some point, because I find children to be wonderful learning beings and I'd like to help with and be a part of that process, but as I've learned over the years, I never truly know what future me wants. No matter how convinced I am at any moment that past me was wrong but that this time, present me is completely right, I know it's all a trick. I think.

A somewhat ordered list of a few (/many?) more things about me:

I'm 34, 5'8, 150 lbs, and Chinese American

I'm passionate about learning in general (especially about how/what/why people think) but am even more passionate about sharing everything I learn with other people (but having to tone it down because no, my friends don't always want to read 500-word essays on obscure niche topics, since no one is as excited about the brain's default mode network, the viability of gift economies, or basketball analytics as me. But in the one-in-a-million chance that you are... you know what to do...).

Some of my favorite TV shows have been The Good Place, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Sex Education, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, As We See It, and Atypical. I usually read non-fiction (i.e. Antifragile, Civilized to Death, How to Change Your Mind), but one piece of fiction I particularly enjoyed recently is Anxious People by Fredrik Backman (related: if you like to teasingly mock everyone and everything, I will like you).

I both practice time-restricted eating (usually a 6-7 hour window) and routinely eat 60+ pieces of sushi at AYCE sushi.

I love sharing stories, but also, I'm an especially confusing story-teller. There's often really no sensical reason to the order in which I say things. And my sentences will often have way too many clauses, because I both get distracted way too easily and also feel a need to finish my original thought.

I'm in a constant battle with people's names, so I've been known to refer to people by descriptors until it becomes too cumbersome to say ""my friend's sister's boyfriend"" repeatedly in a story. Especially if he also has a sister.

One could probably play bingo with the catch phrases I routinely utilize. Some of the words one might include on said bingo card: ""incentivized"", ""societal"", ""status goals"", ""evolved"", ""midwit"", ""right-tailed""/""left-tailed"", ""zero-sum"", ""subconsciously"", ""threshold"", ""confidence-level"", ""update \[one's\] priors"".

I will consistently refer to the difference between the absence of evidence and the evidence of absence. As a result, I am open to the possibility of most things. Similar to my prior point about how I've always been wrong in the past about myself so I'm likely still wrong now, the same would apply to humanity as a whole and whatever the currently accepted consensus ""truths"" are. Recently, that openness has led to an interest in energy healing, spirituality, and plant medicine.

Anyways, if any of this seems interesting to you, please send me a PM/chat! While I'm hoping to find someone that I connect with longer-term, interesting conversations are always very treasured."
