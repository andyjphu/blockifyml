Though meme coins took a breather, $SOL itself is soaring high, trading at $265.78 with impressive 21.52% gains. Solana's DEX volume is buzzing louder than ever right now. Guess the ‚ÄúTrump effect‚Äù did shake things up! 

While Solana meme coins catch their breath, $KAS (Kaspa) is flexing its mining muscles. With Marathon Digital adding KAS to its mining portfolio, it's now among the top 7 mineable coins. Current price tag? $0.13, with a 3.09% intraday boost. Talk about a miner‚Äôs dream come true. 

And guess who‚Äôs stealing the GambleFi spotlight? Rollblock is here, and it‚Äôs all about making crypto gaming exciting‚Äîand dare we say, profitable. Whether you gamble your heart out, stack your RLBK tokens for those casino revenue rewards, or stake them for a VIP-worthy 20% yield, Rollblock has endless rewards for everyone. Price action? RLBK tokens currently sparkle at $0.047. If you're sleeping on this presale, you might just miss out on the next 100x gem.

The crypto stage is buzzing, from meme coins, miners, and gamblers to whales. Who‚Äôs ready to take the big leap?

The Risks of Different Staking Methods: A No-Bullshit Guide,DeFiYieldClub,1i9tz75,2025-01-25 13:52:05,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9tz75/the_risks_of_different_staking_methods_a/,Solanafluent,,"Staking is one of the easiest ways to earn passive income in crypto, but not all staking methods are created the same. Some come with good rewards, while others can damage your portfolio if your not careful. Before you lock up your assets, It is important to know what you are getting yourself into. By a request from a community yielder I have tried to break down the risks with different stratetgy.

# 1. Exchange Staking

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) make staking super easy. Just a few clicks and your earning. But easy comes at a cost:

* **Custodial Risk:** Your coins are not  really yours if they are sitting on an exchange. If the exchange gets hacked, mismanages funds, or collapses (FTX, anyone?), you could lose everything.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Governments crack down on exchange staking all the time. One day you are staking, the next day your funds are locked up.
* **Lack of Transparency:** You have no idea what the exchange is doing with your assets behind the scenes.

**Risk Level: High**

# 2. Self-Custody Staking (Validator Delegation)

If you stake directly to a validator on a proof-of-stake (PoS) network like Solana, you keep control of your assets. Sounds great, but there are still some risks:

* **Slashing Risk:** Some networks punish validators for bad behavior or downtime. Solana doesn‚Äôt slash for downtime, but Ethereum does.
* **Validator Risk:** A bad validator means lower rewards or potential delays in unstaking.
* **Liquidity Risk:** Staking locks up your assets for a set period, so if you need funds fast, you might be stuck waiting.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 3. Liquid Staking

Liquid staking protocols (, Lido, Jito, The Vault, Marinade) give you a token that represents your staked assets. You can use this token in DeFi while still earning staking rewards.

* **Smart Contract Risk:** If the protocol gets hacked, you could lose your staked assets.
* **Depeg Risk:** The liquid staking token (mSOL, vSOL) might not always be worth exactly 1:1 with the original asset. But if mSOL or vSOL depeg it would simply be an arbitrage oppertunity as market would buy up the LST and simply unstake it for insta rewards.
* **Centralization Risk:** A few big liquid staking providers controlling the majority of assets can be a concern.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 4. Restaking (Solayer and Similar Protocols)

Restaking lets you take already-staked assets and put them to work securing other networks for extra rewards. More yield? Yes. More risk? Also yes.

* **Smart Contract and Protocol Risks:** These are still new, experimental protocols, meaning more risk.
* **Complexity Risk:** Restaking requires some knowledge and active management. You cant just set it and forget it.

**Risk Level: High**

# 5. Staking via DeFi Lending Platforms

Some lending platforms (Save, Kamino) let you stake assets as collateral to borrow or leverage trade. Higher yield potential, but serious risks:

* **Liquidation Risk:** If your collateral value drops, your position could be wiped out.
* **Interest Rate Fluctuations:** Lending rates shift constantly, meaning your APY could drop fast.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** More complex contracts mean a higher chance of exploits.

**Risk Level: High**

# Final Thoughts

Every staking method has its pros and cons. The best approach? Diversify your staking strategies, use reputable platforms, and never go all-in on one method. Keep an eye on your risk tolerance and make sure you are not locking yourself out of liquidity when you need it most.

Solaxy: How the First Layer-2 on Solana Could Push $SOL to $400,Blockviews,1i9sa25,2025-01-25 12:37:53,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i9sa25/solaxy_how_the_first_layer2_on_solana_could_push/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Solana‚Äôs ecosystem is thriving like never before as it hits new milestones with its stablecoin supply soaring to $10B and TVL climbing an extraordinary 800%. This January alone, $SOL witnessed a jaw-dropping $4.8B influx in stablecoin flows. Adding to the buzz is the unexpected rise of Trump-inspired meme coins, which have ushered in a surge of new users to the network.

In the spotlight is Solaxy, riding high on Solana‚Äôs momentum. As the first Layer-2 chain in the ecosystem, $SOLX is tackling congestion and scalability issues, making DeFi smoother and more efficient. Priced at $0.001614, with $14.5M raised so far, $SOLX is rapidly gaining attention as it simplifies staking, farming, and swapping for users. 

$SOL recently peaked at $293 amid the meme coin frenzy ‚Äî could $400 be within reach? With Solaxy addressing network bottlenecks and enhancing infrastructure, the synergy between $SOL and $SOLX might just redefine the future of DeFi on Solana.

Will Solaxy push Solana to new highs? Keep an eye on this dynamic duo as 2025 shapes up to be a pivotal year.

The Ultimate Guide to Staking: Earn Passive Income with Crypto,DeFiYieldClub,1i9l35j,2025-01-25 06:32:43,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9l35j/the_ultimate_guide_to_staking_earn_passive_income/,Solanafluent,,"# 1. Introduction to Staking

# What is Staking?

Staking is a way to earn rewards on your crypto by locking it up to help secure a blockchain network. Instead of just holding your tokens, staking lets you put them to work and earn passive income. It‚Äôs like earning interest in a savings account, but for crypto.

# Proof of Stake (PoS) vs. Proof of Work (PoW)

* **PoW (Proof of Work)**: Used by Bitcoin, miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This requires a lot of computing power and energy.
* **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Instead of miners, validators are chosen based on how much crypto they stake. This method is more energy-efficient and allows for faster transactions.

# 2. Benefits of Staking

# Earn Passive Income

By staking, you receive rewards in the form of more crypto. For example, if you stake 100 SOL with a 8% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), you will earn 8 SOL over a year.

# Support Network Security

Stakers help validate transactions and prevent attacks. The more users staking, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes.

# Eco-Friendly Alternative to Mining

Unlike PoW mining, staking does not require large amounts of energy, making it a more sustainable way to support blockchain networks.

# 3. Types of Staking

# Direct Staking

* You lock up your assets directly on a blockchain.
* Requires technical knowledge.
* You are responsible for managing your stake.

# Delegated Staking

* You delegate your tokens to a trusted validator who stakes them for you.
* Easier for beginners.
* Validators take a small commission from your rewards.

# Liquid Staking

* You stake your assets but receive a liquid staking token (LST) like vSOL, mSOL, or JitoSOL, which can be used in DeFi.
* Allows you to stay liquid and use your staked funds for lending, farming, or other yield strategies.
* Higher rewards potential but involves smart contract risks.

# 4. How to Get Started with Staking

# Choosing the Right Crypto for Staking

* Popular staking tokens include **SOL (Solana), ETH (Ethereum), ADA (Cardano), and DOT (Polkadot).**
* Consider factors like staking yield, lock-up periods, and project credibility.

# Selecting a Wallet and Platform

* Use secure wallets like **Phantom, Ledger, or Solflare**.
* Choose a staking platform that offers transparency and security, such as **Marinade, Lido, Jito, or The Vault**.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Staking

1. **Choose a Wallet**: Set up a non-custodial wallet (etc Phantom for Solana or MetaMask for Ethereum).
2. **Select a Staking Provider**: Decide whether to stake directly with the network or through a third-party staking service.
3. **Stake Your Tokens**: Follow the platforms instructions to delegate your tokens.
4. **Track Your Rewards**: Use blockchain explorers or staking dashboards to track earnings.

# 5. Risks and Considerations

**Slashing Risks**

Some blockchains will put penalties if validators act corrupt or fail to validate transactions properly. Choosing a strong validator minimizes this risk.

# Lock-Up Periods

* Some networks require a **cooldown period** before you can unstake your tokens. Avoid CEX ( central exchanges at all costs) Coinbase even take a 35% cut from your rewards. That's insane.
* Liquid staking removes this issue but carries its own risks.

# Market Volatility

* Crypto prices goes up or down, so while you earn staking rewards, your staked assets value may decrease.
* Diversifying assets and strategies can help mitigate losses.

# 6. Advanced Staking Strategies

# Yield Farming with Liquid Staking

* Liquid staking tokens (vSOL, mSOL) can be used in **liquidity pools, lending platforms, or farming strategies** to earn extra rewards on top of staking yields. ( even more crypto)

# Restaking for Extra Rewards

* Some protocols allow **restaking**, where you use your liquid staking rewards to earn even more yield in different DeFi platforms.

# Diversification Strategy

* Split your stake across different validators to reduce risk and increase chances of better APY returns.

# Successful Staking Projects

* **Lido (ETH Staking)**: One of the largest staking platforms with liquid staking.
* **Marinade (SOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking.
* **The Vault (vSOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking focusing on community.

# 8. Future of Staking

# Emerging Trends

* **Increased Institutional Adoption**: More funds and enterprises staking crypto for yield.
* **Enhanced DeFi Integrations**: Liquid staking becoming central to yield strategies.

# Regulatory Considerations

* Some countries are **taxing staking rewards as income**, while others see them as capital gains.
* Decentralized staking may face **future regulatory review,** staying informed is key.

# Final Thoughts

Staking is one of the best ways to earn passive income in crypto while supporting network security. Whether you go for **direct staking, delegated staking, or liquid staking**, each method has its pros and cons. The key is to choose a strategy that fits your risk tolerance and investment goals.

In Defense of Sentinel Irelia (Long post),loreofleague,1i9bcvl,2025-01-24 20:09:08,3,0.8,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/loreofleague/comments/1i9bcvl/in_defense_of_sentinel_irelia_long_post/,deevulture,Rant,"It‚Äôs been nearly five years this summer since the Sentinels of Lights event but I‚Äôm just compounding my thoughts about Irelia‚Äôs role in the event and addressing some of the complaints I‚Äôve seen about the event since its release. I want to preface too, by pointing out that the complaints I‚Äôve listed here are not addressed to anyone in particular, but a combination of complaints I‚Äôve seen over the years mainly on subreddits not just including this one. Feel free to discuss in the comments if you disagree but I‚Äôm not trying to make a straw man out of anyone‚Äôs issue with SOL.

I am aware that the event is poorly written, in fact, it‚Äôs amongst the worst written pieces of fiction I‚Äôve read in the past five years (WR version aside but that stuff is barely a story to begin, and I‚Äôm largely focusing on the client version here). That said, bad works of fiction can have literary merit to discuss, and one‚Äôs writing or understanding of writing can improve immensely from analyzing poorly written things. Irelia‚Äôs inclusion is not among the bad things included in the story.

**Why Irelia?**

Irelia is the best character to have included for the event. If we recall who Irelia is she is the Leader of the Ionian Resistance not just against Noxus, but invaders in general. Assuming *Stains on a Name*, her color story, takes place after the events of the First Ionian Invasion, we can assume Irelia serves a role as a leader of not just the Resistance, but of a militia that seeks to defend Ionia from any invaders. If true, then she is the Defender of Ionia itself. Therefore, it makes sense that a person who fits this role in the region would be selected, in fact, it might even be the best pick Riot made for this event barring Vayne and Pyke (if the latter weren‚Äôt massacred in writing that is). ¬†

Irelia would be invested in any threat, therefore, that targets Ionia. This includes the Black Mist, which she reasonably assumes to be Noxian in origin, as Noxus often tries to leverage out any way, shape, or form how to defeat Ionia. If they had something like the Black Mist they would‚Äôve used it. In her [VGU AMA Riot writer JohnoDyin points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8b1ulz/comment/dx3bbe8/) that Irelia is constantly paranoid of foreign threats returning to shore. We know in her voicework that Irelia has issue with *any* invaders or tyrants who want to take over her home (Noxus just happens to be the biggest one and the one she has the most hatred/trauma related to). Therefore, it would make sense that she sees this threat and seeks to resolve it immediately, and would join with that group who seems to be the only ones intended to doing so (for a lack of alternative choice).

And truthfully, no other champions really fit the option to *embody* Ionia as a whole, not simply as a faction head or member. Karma is transformed by the Mist, the Kinkou keep to themselves (highlighted in Irelia‚Äôs AMA that this is something she has issue with), Akali wants to strike it out on her own, the other characters in Ionia simply do not fit for various reasons. ¬†I‚Äôve seen some argue because of the second Ionian Invasion, that Irelia would be needed there, but frankly 1) we don‚Äôt know if has started now. Yasuo answers Irelia‚Äôs call in ‚ÄúAwaken,‚Äù but in SOL he should be either still in the Shadow Isles or en-route to Noxus. If he returned to Ionia then it would be after this, and this battle seems to be an early one in the Invasion. And 2) Even if the Invasion were ongoing, it‚Äôs likely put on definite hold as both sides are being affected by the mist, and frankly that is a more pressing threat to Irelia than Noxus atm. Irelia would join an international organization combating this threat to protect the *entirety* of Ionia, and rescue its spiritual leader from corruption. Speaking of that ‚Äì

It also makes sense for Irelia to be chosen to contrast Karma. As already stated, Irelia represents Ionia, both in its strengths (resistance to foreign invaders) and its brokenness (struggle with traditional values ‚Äì as Irelia herself struggles with the person she‚Äôs become and how her family would see her and as embodied in her broken blades, versus those new ones embraced during and after the Invasion). From a symbolic standpoint, having Irelia be the one to go after Karma, who is the physical manifestation of the Spirit of Ionia itself, and save her is thematic perfect. They are two halves of one coin ‚Äì opposites, down to how even their designs are contrasts of each other, how their splash arts are mirrored halves of one altercation. This is an *inspired* selection by Riot, if only something more substantial were done with it.

**Irelia‚Äôs Characterization in the Event is not that Bad (it‚Äôs Decent in Fact)**

This is a strange assessment to make given the whole event‚Äôs insistence of not writing characters as how they‚Äôre supposed to be (to various degrees), but I would argue Irelia doesn‚Äôt fit this critique. Based on Irelia‚Äôs voicelines, we know that Irelia is righteous (maybe a bit self-righteous), temperamental and angry, a bit depressed/mournful, and somewhat unhinged. A lot of her characterization in the event fits those lines, even if they are played to comedic effect.

Irelia would not like or trust Riven, because Riven is a war criminal who has fame enough to merit her inclusion in the Irelia memorial stele, whom per her own words has a long and bloody history (which fits with Riven‚Äôs inclusion in the aforementioned stele if they have fought before). It makes sense that she assumes a Noxian plot when she sees her, because Irelia has no reason to assume Riven has been redeemed and the story implies their meeting here is the first since the first Invasion. That being said, once presented with the stakes (Karma‚Äôs corruption and the Sentinels being the only other option), she *will* join them, because she must. Irelia‚Äôs whole character is about doing things that she doesn‚Äôt want out of necessity, this is no different.

That doesn‚Äôt mean she has to like working with Riven. Irelia is kinda petty and obviously is the kind of person who would hold onto a grudge *long* after it‚Äôs overdue to forget. We can gleam this from her lines in game ‚Äì giggling about sinking warships with a thousand pebbles, saying she‚Äôll dance on enemies‚Äô graves, mocking people for their lack of grace as ‚Äòpoor dancers‚Äô as she defeats them in battle, her ban line being an almost childish flat insult of ‚Äútyrant‚Äù and nothing more, and so forth. Her dismissal towards Riven is arguably the actual way one would write her, were she in a comedic piece. She might be one of the only characters who‚Äôs actually in-character. ¬†(Barring the exception of her attacking Karma immediately upon Karma‚Äôs turn which seems a bit cold of her, I feel like idk more weight could‚Äôve been given here but then again that‚Äôs asking for fruit from the desiccated tree that is the Rise of Sentinels Event).

I‚Äôve seen some people have beef with Irelia based on her characterization with regards to her warming up to Riven over the course of the event to which I will address in the next section.

**Irelia‚Äôs Intended Arc and how Riven fits into this (it Makes sense)**

Rise of the Sentinels event is bad, as already stated. The characters are written for comedic purposes, flanderized for that reason, if not completely rewritten in a way that does not reflect their prior lore or VA work. Irelia is as already explained, a bit of the exception (even if she‚Äôs written with comedy in mind). She is among the few characters in the event to even have any form of an arc.

Prior to this event Irelia had no dynamic lore. Her character was largely static, with only *Stains on a Name* having her come to terms with the New Age of Violence in Ionia (fascinating direction for a heroic character I might add). All other events she‚Äôs just the Resistant leader as her bio establishes her. We know she likes to dance, and that she can‚Äôt do it for fun anymore and she mourns her family whom she has a complicated relationship with because they died sticking to Ionian traditionalism, whereas she betrays that and lives. She hates Noxians to the point of joking that they aren‚Äôt people. But the story stays *there* in that one spot, without moving further. There is no change to how she views the world, herself, other people (including other groups), or her position said evolving world. She‚Äôs static, and she‚Äôs not a character that should be that.

Irelia per Riot Reav3, was included in the event specifically to contrast Riven, and this can be seen in the writing itself. They are each other‚Äôs most dynamic in the event and interact with each other the most. Irelia over the course of the event seems to warm up to Riven, enough to have somewhat amicable conversations with her, and later save her several times. In Irelia‚Äôs very static lore ‚Äì this would be seen as OOC. But the point of that lore is to establish Irelia as someone who does anything for Ionia even if it goes against her childhood beliefs. Yes she is bitter, and angry, and hateful, but she‚Äôs also *pragmatic.* Someone who would side with people such as Zed to fight Noxus, fight any threat towards Ionia. That is going to include Riven, who over the course of the event proves to be only annoying and not actively malicious like other Noxians she‚Äôs seen (and she knows Noxian tyranny). And yes, it had to be Riven.

Riven is the most fitting to the Noxian Champion for SOL. Barring the fact that most other Noxian champions have reason to not join (including the fact that they would rely on their own strength/means and not on some foreign order), Riven is the only Noxian we have prior established lore of Irelia extending and olive branch to. Their interaction in game has Irelia challenge her to prove her redemption, as opposed to any other Noxian, whom she‚Äôs dismissive or sees as a grave liner. There is also good parallelism between the two of them ‚Äì symbolically blades ‚Äòbroken‚Äô due to the first Invasion, because of Noxus. Irrevocably changed by that event in their lives and still trying to find their way afterwards. Irelia is too violent for traditional Ionia; Riven is too pacifist for modern day Noxus. The fact that *this* is the first time they‚Äôve interacted in lore is perhaps the bigger crime frankly.

With that in mind if I were to guess what the intended setup for Sentinel Irelia it is this ‚Äì Irelia is meant to grow more as a Defender of Ionia. Not just one that repels Noxians, but also a hero that is able to right the corruption (of foreign origin) that plagues Ionia via symbolically of Karma. In the journey to that, she learns to warm up to the one Noxian who is trying herself to be better, a more nuanced view of the world (I do not think she will start liking Noxians, she will still dislike them, but she can be more nuanced about it ‚Äì it is a return to her own family‚Äôs beliefs, it is a way of healing from pain, cause Irelia‚Äôs hatred of Noxus comes from pain, not simply hating them just cause). At the end, she returns to Ionia in a somewhat better place mentally. The bones of an arc are there, a shame the event seems to have forgotten Karma, cause a fight between the two would‚Äôve been the cherry on this development.

So yeah, that is my piece re: Sentinel Irelia. To conclude ‚Äì Irelia‚Äôs character established as a defender of Ionia makes logical sense that she would join. She is pragmatic, so she would do so even if it‚Äôs an ambiguous organization who also hired Riven. Because she has no other options, and she has achieved so much despite the odds before. There is good establishment of an arc here, where Irelia can develop as a person more but as this is SOL it‚Äôs not *that* much. But it‚Äôs more than expected. She was a good pick for the event and I stand by this."

Solana (SOL): will its price surpass $300?,CapitalistExploits,1i93rue,2025-01-24 14:30:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i93rue/solana_sol_will_its_price_surpass_300/,kayakero,,"Solana (SOL) continues to show a strong upward trend. The altcoin, which had seen a dip during Donald Trump's inauguration, has recovered and is once again trading above $250. Against this backdrop, traders and investors are wondering whether SOL will be able to reach a new all-time high.

**Solana resumes bullish trend**

Since January 13, Solana has been in a clear upward trend. This movement reached its all-time high (ATH) of $293 last Sunday, January 19, according to data from¬†[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana).

The asset subsequently had a brief correction, validating the 50% Fibonacci retracement level as support. Moreover, the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) also acted as an important support point in this process.

Following this recent momentum, buyers are now attempting to break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level located at $265. If they manage to sustain SOL price above this level, there are high chances of it approaching its ATH again.

If the all-time high is surpassed, the Fibonacci projection tool suggests that the next target would be at $357.

However, the current low trading volume raises doubts about this scenario. Historically, upward movements that are not accompanied by high volumes tend to be unsustainable.

# Divergences in technical indicators

The ADX, which measures the strength of the prevailing trend, is on the upside and is near 30, indicating that despite low volume, buyers are gaining ground in the market.

The MACD also supports this trend. This indicator, which had already shown a bullish crossover, continues to form increasingly larger green bars.

https://preview.redd.it/v89don4t9qee1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb65369ad98a722539b4a855461dfb45c8e403d

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is causing concern. With values ‚Äã‚Äãclose to the 70 limit, further price increases could push SOL into an overbought state. This could make it difficult for buyers to push Solana price beyond $300 and sustain it above that level.

**Solana Network Activity**

The increase in activity within the Solana network is one of the reasons behind this bullish movement. Solana has established itself as a reference blockchain, especially in the memecoin space. It is no coincidence that Donald Trump and his wife Melania chose this network to launch their official meme coins.

Furthermore, the Solaxy¬†project¬†promises to take the network to a new level as Solana‚Äôs first layer-two (L2) solution. By operating as an L2, it offers increased speed and scalability compared to the main SOL blockchain.

Solaxy already has a native token, SOLX, currently in the pre-sale stage. Interested users have until Thursday 23 to acquire the token at a discount and access benefits such as staking.

*Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative offices*

Undersecretary Ah'nuriel was having a very odd day. Of course, odd days were becoming almost normal of late. Her husband had sent her a long message detailing how much he missed her scent. She'd gotten fairly good at guessing what wasn't being said over the past few years. Messages with hidden meaning were only meaningful if you knew how to read them. And what was being said was difficult - most of their contracted work was going to the Sword of the Light Gods, however the Terrans were beginning to hire companies of their own accord. That was the reason for the meeting today. A Terran who appeared to be wearing subtle joint braces underneath a very oddly fashioned suit - it covered the entirety of his body, with a few cloth decorations. The entire thing was black save for a white shirt. His sunglasses were unusual, and not just because he only had two eyes. They were square and very dark, making his entire hatchet-looking furless face somehow more off-putting. Old instincts were warning her that this Terran brought danger to her door.

The undersecretary took a breath, remembering that somehow this species was a formidable one ‚Äì and one of her tasks was to find out why. Still, the Terran was polite enough and allowed himself to be sniffed first. His scent was cloying, and almost resembled a Minister's in some ways ‚Äì there was an honest deception to him, as if he expected things to be withheld.

She took a breath, considering her first move. ""So how can the Trade Cooperative assist you today...""

The man smiled easily. ""Smith will suffice. Agent Smith, representing Skunkworks Insurance. We'd like to investigate an opportunity for trade. If you're not familiar with us, our business is risk assessment at the core. We assess risk and set a price on assuming a worst-case scenario for that risk. In dangerous times we may refuse to do business in an area entirely. But now with the peace accords, the risk is substantially lower. We'd like some assistance from the Trade Cooperative.""

And there was the deception wrapped in a smooth voice. Or at least the first one. Their business wasn't entirely risk assessment, but something else. The undersecretary kept her fur low with an effort. ""Well, our business is the trade of goods, so there may be areas of overlap. But I'm not certain what more we could commit to without specifics.""

""Well, multiple Terran companies have expressed interest in forming permanent partnerships here and paying well for their partnership. Worlds like yours and Hurdop Prime are rare ‚Äì high gravity, atmosphere conducive to our life forms, and land that's good for many crops. Not Terran, of course; your gravity would kill most of our plant life. But, as a manufacturing center, many things that you can make here are far more expensive to make on other worlds. In addition, there are Terrans who would come here to train physically - athletes training their muscles in higher gravity would make exceptional leaps over those that don't. In return, economic prosperity and perhaps unique items of our own that can withstand this environment. We'd like assurances that this peace is a binding one, and that honoring our contracts won't leave us at a loss.""

Ah'nuriel cocked her head slightly. ""Perhaps that is a question better answered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.""

""Come now, Undersecretary. A meeting with the Foreign Affairs department would leave me with bland reassurance no matter the truth in addition to my already aching knees. I seek the honesty that only comes from a balance sheet. In addition, I understand that you have something of a personal stake in continued peace.""

Her fur flared almost of its own volition. ""That information is...accurate. But not quite relevant.""

""On this, we must agree to disagree - risk assessment requires accurate information, and a great deal of detail. With that said, here is some information that I have from Terran companies."" Agent Smith slid a small datapad over. ""Those are the companies willing to invest, and the amounts they are willing to pay at this time. They are substantial, and with assurances of security could grow. Which would mean the amounts they pay us would grow, and everyone goes home happy. Of course I would ensure my superiors knew your name in my reports. So, information for information. There's no reason to say yes or no right now - my superiors are arranging a conference at our offices in New Casablanca in a few months, and we are making an attendee list right now. Purely speculative for the moment, but I'm sure if I polled your co-workers right now there would be several interested parties. With the right voices in the right ears, a great deal can change. A captain could have a name, for example.""

Ah'nuriel nodded reluctant agreement. ""Information for information, then.""

*Homeplate*

Gryzzk's life had never been so busy. There had been a few days of respite as his ship and crew had celebrated and enjoyed a fine night at Sparrows, and then began the process of correcting and implementing new things that their victory had allowed the company to purchase. Inertial dampeners, a secondary shielding system, some additional systems for weapons, new paint, and what may have been most important, a new coffee maker for Engineering. For himself and the bridge team, however, it meant exceptionally long days in a command simulator, where they'd been run through multiple engagements and tactical sequences. After each engagement, the proctors from the 7th would go over everyone's errors in excruciating detail. The proctors were dark magicians at finding errors - even when they'd run through simulated exercises perfectly, there was still a detail that had been overlooked, a way it could have been done better. He'd lost the entire ship on several occasions, which unnerved him as the proctors went over every failing he'd had during those engagements. It was disheartening until O'Brien had finally told the proctors to give them the room. In the conference room over tea, coffee, and foul language they finally were able to gain a sense of what was happening; each simulation was meant to test a specific aspect of their skills, and in the portions they were looking at, Gryzzk and the rest of the crew had performed admirably. Within the rest of it was dressing for them to find mistakes and play headgames - O'Brien pointed out two specific instances where Gryzzk had done something, been called out for it, and then did as they suggested and still merited a chewing out. Things seemed to go better somehow after that, with them acting and reacting to things with a bit less tension.

All of that meant precious little time with his wife and children. He'd had a chance to watch the news a bit more, and it seemed as if every day there was something new that made him feel as if his company was falling behind on a tally sheet that existed only in his mind. Even the Swords of the Light Gods had taken on a successful job ‚Äì a passenger escort run between New Casablanca and Vilantia. It nagged at him until after three weeks he sent a terse voice message to the Major advising that he was going to stand the company down for a week to assess their next steps prior to their next job.

The reply message was a soft chuckle and a ""Your company, your rules.""

His delivery of the news at the morning briefing was met with relief and cheers from the crew. As much as they would have kept going for a few more weeks if he'd asked, Gryzzk had observed the Terrans seemed to believe that making time for family and new friends was important ‚Äì perhaps that was one of their secrets.

They finished up the day's work and Gryzzk found himself on the couch at the end of the day as the children all took spots, with Nhoot staying close to Gryzzk and Gro'zel staying closer to her mother, while the twins took their place in the middle of all of them. Gryzzk frowned a bit as the mercenary news of the day was a re-enactment of the Sword's second engagement - a battle against a Throne's Fortune base which left Gryzzk talking to the wallscreen - only to have his opinions confirmed by the commentators. The Swords seemed to be taking every opportunity to simply overwhelm with force and then destroy even when it would have been more profitable to disable and take the ships whole; particularly since the Hurdop government had formally disavowed the Throne's Fortune as a renegade element and confirmed that there would be a bounty paid for proof in the form of letters of marque.

One of commentators was blunt. ""It's like they're a bully who got beaten and tries to prove they aren't weak by picking on the ones they know don't have a shot. If this is an advert for their skills, I dunno who's buying...""

The one bonus of the arrival of the Swords was that more Vilantian shows were available; the family sat and watched a few classic comedy shows and smiled appropriately, but something seemed off about them. Perhaps it was the time, but the jokes didn't make either of them laugh like they used to.

Still, they went to bed and the next day they took one of the shuttles to New Casablanca. Not the bar district, but the more family-friendly shopping district, filled with temporary stalls dotting the more permanent structures where a dazzling array of goods from Terra could be purchased. While Gryzzk only kept his rank tab on himself for emergency communications, the girls had refused to leave until their purple berets were on their head with their rank proudly placed. Grezzk took the lead, finding a small area of shops that had started to stock items from the Vilantian homeworld. Grezzk took the opportunity to pay a shameful price for some foodstuffs and a few small items that reminded them of home.

Once outside, several Vilantians were waiting, their scent an undisguised disgust. They wore the gold and black uniforms of the Swords company with ranks that designated them as senior staff ‚Äì all in all this did not bode well.

""Nameless captain, step forth. We do not wish to harm you. We bear a message from the Minister of War.""

Gryzzk closed one pair of his eyes for a moment. ""I recall Commodore A'Drapir's message quite well, friends - may the dead gods treat him well.""

""I do not recall Commodore A'Drapir being named Minister of War. The Minister himself has an offer. He sees that you have become something unexpected; and with that he offers his voice in Restoration and a role within the Swords of the Light Gods. Your own ship, your own crew consisting of the finest Vilantians from Clan Aa'Porti. Picked soldiers to do your bidding ‚Äì if you do his bidding. The Clan Way calls to you. Your Great Lord calls to you. The Minister would have your voice in the future of Vilantia. Answer yes with your full voice, and all this-"" there was a vague gesture to their surroundings ""-can be a forgotten memory.""

There was a pause ""What future would that be?""

""A future where the Clan Way is made truth and the worlds of this sector are held to it.""

Gryzzk closed his remaining eyes, knowing that what he was going to say would probably condemn him in the eyes of at least three Ministers. ""Not long ago, the Clan Way was the only way I knew. But there is a better way. Clans built not by a birth more than thirty generations past, but choice. My clan is young, built on those the Clan Way would have us cast aside, ignore, and condemn. If we win victory, we learn. If we are defeated, we do not pretend it didn't happen. This offer would have suited me once. But it does not suit me now. When I walk from the twilight, it will be on my own feet with a clan of Vilantians, Hurdop, and Terrans at my side.""

The disgust and fury in their scent made the girls recoil behind Grezzk, and finally one of them spat at the ground. ""None who dwell in the twilight may pass judgment on those in the light. Minister Aa'tebul will lend his voice to more worthy causes. We will not fight this day."" So saying, they spun and walked away with precision.

Grezzk swallowed, and both Gro'zel and Nhoot came out from behind Grezzk. Grezzk had a slight smirk on her face.

""Lord A'Gryzzk, we must make another child soon."" She leaned into him warmly for a moment before they began walking to the shuttle with their purchases.

""I'm no lord. I just do what's best for my family and those under my command.""

""And those under your command would call you a Lord.""

""You realize that would make you a Lady, correct?""

""It would ‚Äì but only because you shine so brightly.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""I don't like it. A Lord is born a Lord, and I was not born such."" Still, there was anxiety. He'd effectively become a lord by the acclaim of those he commanded, and even prior to that with managing Lord A'kifab's household. But to become a lord seemed almost insulting in some way.

There was a bit of consideration and silence before Gryzzk caught a familiar scent and turned to call out. ""Edwards?""

Edwards stepped from around a market stall ‚Äì she was wearing a set of hooded grey robes that covered her almost head to toe. She looked a bit embarrassed, but smiled. ""Gonna have to wear perfume next time. Ugh.""

""Why?""

""Hiding my scent, obviously."" She shrugged. ""So what'd those bumblebees want?""

""They wanted me to come work for them.""

Edwards blinked. ""Oh. You, ah, thinkin' about it?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""No. I have a clan already, as you recall.""

Edwards seemed relieved. ""Okay, cool. Yeah, that must have been hard.""

""Not as much as I thought it would. I have something meaningful here, and we have agreed to things. Together. They did not wish to include anyone else. But we have a conundrum of sorts."" Gryzzk paused to consider how to couch the question. ""Titles are important to us. Lead Servant, Lord, Greatlord, things like that. Does Terran or Hurdop culture have a title that fits this situation that we're in?""

Edwards chuffed softly. ""Whatcha mean?""

""Well essentially a commoner in what is traditionally a noble position.""

""Oh yeah, your captains are...but not really for the Hurdop...sorta."" Edwards' eyes unfocused as she seemed to be reading a tablet from her memory and she started thinking out loud. ""But...Samoan - Matai, no. Feudal Japan - Jizamurai, maybe but we'll keep going...Nordic - Jarl - nah too close to earl and they'd call me out for playing too much Skyrim again..."" Finally she snapped back to reality. ""I'll have to think about it. I'll talk to Engineering but we might just need to invent a new word for you, Cap.""

""Indeed. If it comes to that let me know. Now, to the other question I have ‚Äì why were you following me?""

Edwards looked like a child about to get disciplined for marking the walls. ""Well, respectfully Cap, you've made some enemies. Bad Moon's put money on the board for an asskicking with you as the recipient, and few of the Swords were making noises about bringing you into the light according to Reilly.""

""How does Reilly know?""

""She bought 'em a couple drinks. Apparently we all look alike to you.""

""Remind me to compensate her.""

""She said she'll trade the drinks for a refresh on her roots from Mama Grezzk."" Edwards smirked a little.

Grezzk seemed taken aback slightly. ""Mama?""

There was a nod. ""Mmm-hm. On the ship Nhoot calls him Captain Papa, so Mama just kinda grew out of that.""

Grezzk's fur flickered. ""I. I hadn't considered that. Of course, we'll be here whenever she wishes."" She paused for a moment. ""Let her know that tonight we're having a garlic chicken recipe for dinner.""

They shuttled back to the company area and split off; Edwards heading to her room in the barracks and Gryzzk leading his family to their quarters. Gryzzk settled in on the couch with the boys and checked his tablet while the girls ran to their room to play with their new toys. Grezzk began marinating the chicken and preparing the rice before settling in on the couch.

""You don't like the idea of being a Lord, do you?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""It feels wrong, somehow.""

She leaned into him gently. ""Whatever they call you, you will always be my handsome hand.""

For a long moment, there was a bubble of peace as the universe shrank to a small officer's quarters with girls playing and giggling, two boys cradled between their parents, and the parents enjoying the opportunity to stare at a hologram of a Vilantian sunset.

The silence couldn't last forever, and there was a chime at the door. It was Reilly, grinning happily with a small case filled with hair colors. Gryzzk put the boys in their beds as Grezzk lowered the gravity to match the ship standard before opening the door. Reilly came in and was promptly greeted by Nhoot and Gro'zel who simply had to show off their new toys. There was some general laughter and amusement as Reilly nuzzled Grezzk's neck briefly and then sneezed.

Reilly was bouncing a little bit and seemed to almost be everywhere at once, dipping a finger in the marinade and pronouncing it to be 'zippy', and then looking at the twins and ooh'ing and sniffing them delicately so as not to wake them. After that she was teaching the girls to dance. Oddly. Finally she flopped on the couch and tapped on Gryzzk's tablet.

""You didn't read the message I sent, Cap?""

Gryzzk quirked at her. ""I didn't yet.""

""Stuff's happening. Got a lead on a new job outta Hurdop Prime, and the news is going to be interesting tonight.""

The new information was accepted casually, and Gryzzk took his tablet back for more information on the job. It appeared to be a specific request from a new Hurdop trading company called the Great Triangle of Hurdop. The job itself seemed simple; escorting a pair of ships from Hurdop Prime to Terra Prime, then to Vilantia prime, and finally a return to Hurdop Prime. It seemed simple enough, but at the same time it was concerning. He looked at the pay for the job before forwarding it to Rosie with an inquiry if they could add about five percent more and stipulate payment for hazards and combat.

Rosie agreed, and they sent an amended version of the request back to the Great Triangle.

Dinner was a raucous affair, as Reilly told jokes and stories about how Gryzzk was aboard the ship. Finally as they cleaned up, the twins began to stir for their food, and Reilly was polite enough to wait that out while they watched the news. The mercenary-focused section was as interesting as Reilly had promised.

""...and in new stand-ups, we've got a few. Bad Moon Company has announced the formation of a new associate company, the Foreign Legion of Terra. This comes on the heels of Swissguards press release regarding their own Terran Legion of Foreigners and - oooh, here's a little outside the box thinking - Polar Bear Company's rolling out the Foreign Terran Legion. Funnily enough, they're all rocking shades of purple for their colors. Great marketing teams out there."" The announcer shook his head and turn to his co-anchor for more commentary while Reilly began laughing so hard tears were forming.

""Oh. My God."" Reilly wheezed. ""This is awesome.""

""I'm not sure I understand."" Gryzzk tried to focus on the commentators, who seemed pessimistic - they agreed that the 7th Cavalry had caught some manner of lightning in a bottle with the 'OG Terran Foreign Legion', but whether that success could be replicated was an entirely different manner.

Reilly giggled a little bit more before gathering herself and quoting from a movie that Gryzzk vaguely remembered. ""It's like that thing - 'Are you the Judean People's Front?' 'Fuck off! Judean People's Front. We're the People's Front of Judea!' It's hilarious, we're so good we've already got knockoffs.""

Grezzk finally got the twins resettled and changed for bed, and came out to get Reilly's hair color refreshed properly. It was an odd thing to watch, as Grezzk and Reilly chatted amiably about things - Reilly was enthralled by certain aspects of Vilantia, and made casual allusions to shore leave and possibly even vacationing there when the chance came. Finally with her hair color re-purpled and ends re-done, Reilly took her leave.

""I do believe we're going to have to ask your bosses to look at the applications you forwarded sooner rather than later."" Grezzk smiled softly.

""Mmm. Probably. We'll need to avoid damage on this next job.""

""Worry about that on the next job. I would have my handsome hand warm our bed tonight.""

Gryzzk smiled a bit himself as he led his wife to a good night's sleep."

Veil of Madness,HFY,1i8vewz,2025-01-24 08:30:32,31,0.91,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i8vewz/veil_of_madness/,Ligeia194,OC,"Thunder snarled across a sky veined with black clouds, and chemical-laced rain clattered relentlessly against the reinforced plating of Outpost Theta. The structure, perched on a desolate exoplanet known by the official designation PX-731, stood like a solitary fortress above a wasteland of jagged rock. Beyond the floodlights, the swirling storm seemed endless, as though the planet itself were determined to drive every intruder away.

Inside, corridors remained brightly lit and sterile‚Äîan orderly reprieve against the chaos outside. Thirty-two souls lived there: scientists, engineers, and marines from different corners of Earth, each assigned to research the planet‚Äôs rumored energy deposits buried deep below the surface. They had come prepared for harsh conditions and uncooperative weather, but not for what they ultimately discovered. The first sign of trouble came when the station‚Äôs drilling operations uncovered something hidden in the bedrock: a towering alien monolith. Its composition was unlike any alloy on record, and it possessed a faint hum that seemed to reverberate at the edges of human perception.

Lieutenant Colonel Damian Varga‚Äîoften addressed simply as ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù by her security detail‚Äîwas the first to respond to the discovery. Tall and battle-hardened, she carried herself like someone who‚Äôd grown used to outsmarting death. With her helmet tucked under one arm, she joined Dr. Heather Cross and Dr. Pang in the main laboratory. The pair of scientists had pulled up a holographic display showing scans of the buried artifact. Strange markings and metallic ridges were visible just below the planet‚Äôs crust. The station‚Äôs lead geologist, Dr. Cross, gestured at the shimmering data, her eyes flicking with a mix of excitement and concern. She explained that their deep-drilling equipment had hit something unusual, and that odd pulses‚Äîboth electromagnetic and psionic‚Äîhad been detected in the process.

Varga had heard plenty of rumors over the past several months: fleeting readings of strange energy fields and anomalies in seismic data. Now, it seemed those rumors had a tangible source. When she asked if the monolith was truly an alien artifact, Cross confirmed it almost certainly was. The revelations sent a ripple of tension across the outpost. Most of the staff arrived on PX-731 expecting to find new mineral deposits, maybe a new isotope or two. An actual alien structure was far beyond those modest goals.

Despite the warnings from some of the more cautious researchers, a team was assembled to inspect the monolith up close. Varga oversaw the marines preparing for the expedition, while scientists double-checked gear, verifying radiation levels and atmospheric gauges for the subterranean site. Everyone was apprehensive‚Äîbut also curious. If the artifact held advanced technology or unknown power, it could be a breakthrough. The planet‚Äôs relentless storms made every trip outside a small ordeal, but the sense of discovery drove them onward.

The dig site, a yawning chasm about a kilometer from the main outpost, was partially shielded by scaffolding and floodlights. Crews worked in shifts, drilling to expose more of the buried structure. In the bitter wind, Varga and her marines joked to lighten the mood, calling humanity‚Äôs refusal to quit its strongest trait. Some teased that humans were ‚Äútoo stubborn to know when to run,‚Äù but beneath the laughter lay the raw truth that this place was dangerous in ways they couldn‚Äôt yet name.

On the second day, Dr. Cross and her team decided to test the monolith‚Äôs responsiveness with a localized power feed. They set a generator to emit a carefully measured current directly into the artifact. At first, no one noticed anything except a slight vibration beneath their boots. Then the vibration grew into a deep rumbling, as though something massive were shifting far below. Lightning slashed the black sky overhead. Each observer felt a sudden throb behind their eyes‚Äîlike an almost migraine, or a whispered suggestion inside the mind. No one voiced it at that moment, but later they compared notes and realized they‚Äôd all sensed the same bizarre pulse.

Back at the outpost, odd nightmares set in. Crew members reported seeing grotesque shapes or hearing voices calling their names in otherwise empty corridors. Some woke in a cold sweat, certain something was standing at the foot of their beds. The rational mind insisted it was stress, or perhaps the planet‚Äôs environment interfering with sleep patterns. Still, an intangible dread seeped through the station.

Shortly after these nightmares began, Dr. Roth barricaded himself in the greenhouse, babbling about intruders lurking at the edge of his vision. Security feeds showed him speaking to shadows, sometimes cowering, sometimes shouting. When the marines forced their way inside, they discovered him rocking back and forth among overturned tables and broken seedlings, eyes glazed in terror. He kept whispering, ‚ÄúThey want me to open the door,‚Äù though he never explained which door he meant. As medical staff tried to calm him, he became violent and slashed at himself with shards of glass. The greenhouse reeked of damp soil and madness.

In a different part of the facility, Dr. Nguyen vanished from his quarters. No one saw him until Dr. Pang, an astrophysicist, stumbled upon his ravaged remains in a storage area. It appeared that black sludge had seeped from the corpse‚Äôs mouth. Then, to Pang‚Äôs horror, the body lurched upright, lips sewn shut with something that resembled living threads. The corpse‚Äôs blank eyes stared ahead for a moment, and a terrible voice resonated inside Pang‚Äôs mind, saying, ‚ÄúWe see you.‚Äù It was not Nguyen‚Äôs voice. Marines rushed in, but the body collapsed before anyone could fire a shot. The black sludge slithered into a nearby vent, leaving behind only a contorted corpse. The security footage showed fleeting silhouettes in the corridors‚Äîforms that melted out of sight as soon as cameras panned their way. An oppressive atmosphere smothered the outpost, and no one could rationalize the horrors happening within. That first psychic surge from the monolith had unleashed something a long-dead civilization might have imprisoned eons ago.

While some cowered, one person responded differently. Jansen, a quiet but brilliant engineer, holed himself up in the engineering bay. If the intruder was sending telepathic broadcasts that preyed on fear, maybe an electromagnetic countermeasure could weaken or disrupt those signals. His hands trembled as he assembled makeshift EMP devices out of whatever parts he could scavenge. He recalled the marines‚Äô jokes about humanity‚Äôs pigheaded resilience‚Äîa trait that sometimes bordered on recklessness. With the outpost‚Äôs morale evaporating, Jansen clung to this last scrap of defiance, praying it might keep him sane.

On the fifth day after the excavation, Outpost Theta‚Äôs corridors reeked of tension and sweat. Several crew members had either gone missing or slipped into catatonic states. Those still functional were plagued by hallucinations so vivid they sometimes lashed out at empty air. The command center, once pristine, was a mess of blinking monitors, scattered charts, and exhausted faces. Varga, Dr. Cross, Dr. Pang, Jansen, and a handful of others gathered at a conference table displaying a map of the station. The plan they discussed felt like a frantic last resort.

Cross explained that the entity‚Äîwhatever it truly was‚Äîthrived on despair and fear. Human minds were fragile fields it could harvest. Dr. Pang‚Äôs analysis of old sensor logs suggested the alien monolith functioned as both beacon and cage, perhaps containing this psychic predator until they disturbed it. If the structure was fueling it, then destroying the monolith might sever its power. But as Jansen cautioned, that same act could also free the entity completely; they had no guarantees. They were beyond caution now, however. Varga reasoned that if they let it spread unchecked, it could infest the entire planet‚Äîor eventually follow them beyond. The only sure way to remove it was to burn everything, including Outpost Theta. They would overload the station‚Äôs reactor core in a controlled meltdown, destroy the monolith in the process, and evacuate on the shuttle.

Preparation for that meltdown began immediately. While engineers input the override protocols, the entity ramped up its assault. Lights flickered, screens displayed mocking messages, and a wave of hallucinations swept the station. Crew members turned on each other in fits of paranoia, shooting at illusions that assumed the faces of their loved ones. Dead bodies, moved by black tendrils, crept through unlit corridors. The entity was no longer content to feed discreetly‚Äîit was enraged, shrieking through the station‚Äôs intercoms and scarring every mind that touched it.

When the surviving staff crowded into the reactor chamber‚Äîa hot, humming space lined with thick pipes and crackling energy‚Äîthey prepared to finalize the overload countdown. Jansen set his improvised EMP devices in a ring around them, hoping to buy enough time to seal the meltdown. Marine squads stood guard, rifles raised, eyes darting at every flicker or shadow. The tension made every breath feel tight.

Dr. Cross, sweating despite the cooling vents, completed the final override. A klaxon wailed, and a computerized voice announced the initiation of meltdown. Ten minutes. Outside, the skies roared with thunder. Inside, illusions coiled around each person‚Äôs mind. One marine believed he saw his dead wife, begging him to lay down his weapon. Another saw Varga‚Äôs face warp into a ghoul-like visage. Terror and suspicion twisted the air until Jansen triggered the EMP. A searing electric wave rippled out, briefly muting the psychic assault. The illusions stuttered, though not entirely gone.

A frantic scramble erupted as the entity attacked physically, reanimating corpses to block the main corridor leading to the shuttle bay. Rotting mouths stitched shut moaned voiceless curses. Varga ordered everyone else forward as she faced one monstrosity alone. Black sludge twitched on the remains of what had once been a fellow marine, forming barbed appendages. It lashed at her with eerie precision, howling inside her mind. Yet she planted her feet and discharged a barrage of bullets, riddling the entity‚Äôs puppet. All the fear she‚Äôd felt before transformed into an incandescent fury. She roared, ‚ÄúI am not afraid of you!‚Äù The savage defiance rattled the hive-mind. Where fear would have fed it, Varga‚Äôs sheer rage seemed to poison it.

With only seconds left on the meltdown clock, Varga slammed her fist into the corridor‚Äôs emergency seal. The blast door slid shut, trapping her on one side, the rest of the survivors on the other. Jansen pounded against the sealed door, shouting for her to come through, but her voice echoed calmly over the intercom. She told him to leave, to get the rest out alive and carry this fight forward. The meltdown alarms reached a crescendo, and the entire outpost trembled. Through a small window in the blast door, they saw Varga offer a final salute, determination blazing in her eyes.

The reactor core erupted. A white-hot inferno tore through the station‚Äôs structure, incinerating metal, flesh, and the monolith buried below. Shockwaves ripped across the foundation. In the shuttle, Dr. Cross, Dr. Pang, Jansen, and a few battered survivors clung to their seats as the pilot wrestled to launch. The storm outside raged so violently it seemed to merge with the station‚Äôs fiery end in one cataclysmic spectacle. Somehow, the shuttle broke free of the planet‚Äôs gravity and soared into the blackness of space. When the jump drive engaged, they left PX-731 in ruins.

The immediate crisis felt as though it had ended, but the nightmares persisted. Long hours into their voyage, Jansen heard soft whispers in the hum of the engines, almost like a half-forgotten lullaby. Dr. Cross, racked by visions whenever she dozed, kept dreaming of the monolith‚Äôs etched symbols rebuilding themselves from molten fragments. Dr. Pang developed nosebleeds, black flecks peppering the tissue. Something had followed them. By the time they scanned themselves for pathogens, they discovered spore-like organisms in their blood‚Äîtiny pulses of psychic residue left behind by the entity. Though the main hive-mind was presumably destroyed on PX-731, fragments clung to the survivors. The realization stoked fresh panic.

But humans, by nature, rarely accepted despair without a fight. Rather than let the infection drive them mad, they turned to the same defiance that had led Varga to her final stand. Jansen, sweaty and feverish, glared at his reflection in the shuttle‚Äôs viewport. He was furious that after all their sacrifice, the entity‚Äôs remnants still clung to them. Each time he felt the spores scratching at the edges of his mind, he summoned old grudges and fierce memories to smother them in anger instead of terror. Others followed suit, channeling every trace of fear into fury. The spores responded by shrinking away‚Äîa single-celled reflection of the cosmic parasite‚Äôs vulnerability. It seemed that while the entity thrived on despair, it found the raw aggression that defined many humans anathema.

Despite the risk of contaminating anyone else, the crew decided to press onward to Earth. Cross argued that they should remain in quarantine in a remote location, but Jansen insisted they needed to return, if only to warn humanity of the greater threat that might lurk in space. He refused to let them die alone in an uncharted region of the cosmos. The few surviving marines‚Äîsilent, hollow-eyed men and women who‚Äôd lost half their squad‚Äîagreed. They would not fade away in the void.

When the shuttle finally reached the Sol system, Earth‚Äôs security forces scrambled, intercepting their approach. The survivors were immediately placed under high-level quarantine, forced into an isolated facility ringed by armed guards and airlocks. Top scientists in hazmat suits examined the survivors, discovering the toxic spores in their blood‚Äîbut also noticing that the organisms were steadily dying. In the presence of certain adrenaline-fueled neurochemicals, the spores literally withered. Humanity‚Äôs emotional volatility, a trait that many an alien might find confounding, proved lethal to these parasites.

It was a strange and sobering twist: all the carnage unleashed on Outpost Theta by a telepathic monster had been undone by the one thing it couldn‚Äôt digest‚Äîunbridled human passion. For the moment, Earth‚Äôs authorities breathed a shaky sigh of relief. The immediate danger posed by those spores faded as quickly as it had emerged. Still, doctors kept the survivors under observation, while experts combed through the data they had brought back.

High-level personnel deemed PX-731 a war zone, under permanent quarantine. No new expeditions would be authorized without substantial military escort. Unmanned probes were dispatched to scan the wreckage, though the roiling storms still posed an enormous challenge. The official story was that an experimental drilling station succumbed to a catastrophic meltdown. Off the record, cryptic references to an ‚Äúalien monolith‚Äù and ‚Äúpsychic entity‚Äù drifted through classified channels.

Back in the quarantine facility, Dr. Cross coughed up the last residue of black fluid. Jansen, lying on a cot nearby, watched her spat-out phlegm sizzle on the floor. It writhed for a moment before going still, then melted into a dark stain. The two survivors looked at each other, sharing an unspoken awareness that the entity hadn‚Äôt been entirely vanquished. They had dealt it a blow, maybe even broken off a major portion of it forever, but the monolith had been a prison. Something older, bigger, and more ravenous still haunted the cosmos.

Yet where fear might have taken hold, a different resolve grew. Even battered and full of nightmares, humankind refused to cower. The outpost had been destroyed, entire squads lost, countless minds scarred, but they were still alive and armed with the knowledge that these nightmares were not unstoppable. Rumors circulated that Earth‚Äôs military would bolster defenses across colony worlds in case of future threats. Some whispered about building weapons designed to capitalize on the alien parasite‚Äôs aversion to certain human emotional states. Others recommended a permanent moratorium on exploring ancient ruins, but given humanity‚Äôs drive for discovery, few believed that would stick.

An automated broadcast was soon launched into deep space from Earth‚Äôs outer stations. Part warning, part dare, it declared: ‚ÄúCome hungry. Leave furious.‚Äù It was a rallying cry intended to deter any lurking malevolence from testing humanity‚Äôs resolve. Whether that was brilliant or reckless, nobody could say with certainty. The cosmic darkness was vast, and Earth was only one small point of light. But in this precarious new order, humans staked their claim: they would not be easy prey. Not anymore.

Jansen listened to the broadcast from his hospital bed, wincing at the volume. The speaker crackled, repeating those four words in dozens of languages. He understood it was as much a personal vow as it was a universal challenge. The entity they‚Äôd fought had feasted on terror, weaving illusions to break morale. But rage, that messy, visceral emotion humans so often condemned in themselves, had turned out to be the key to their survival. Jansen wondered if the rest of the galaxy might now view humanity with a certain wary respect‚Äîor perhaps a simmering hatred.

Days later, a black-ops team arrived to interview the survivors. They debriefed Dr. Cross extensively about the monolith‚Äôs design, asked Pang about the psionic wave patterns, questioned Jansen about his EMP contraptions and how they might be improved. Throughout every interview, the survivors could sense the underlying fear in their interrogators. Earth‚Äôs leadership, for all its power, hadn‚Äôt been prepared to face an enemy that lurked in the realm of thought itself. Now they knew the playing field had changed.

Varga‚Äôs name echoed in the official logs. Her sacrifice was both a tragedy and a beacon: the last stand of someone who had forced a monstrous entity to recoil, if only for a moment, under the onslaught of raw, righteous anger. Those who had been under her command recalled her unwavering presence. In a final data file recovered from the shuttle, she left a brief audio note: ‚ÄúFor the record, humans don‚Äôt kneel to nightmares. That‚Äôs not how we‚Äôre built.‚Äù The intelligence analysts who reviewed it recognized that ferocity in her tone. It exemplified everything that had given the psychic parasite pause.

Memory of her sacrifice lingered each night when Jansen and Cross tried to sleep, haunted by dreams where Varga still stalked the outpost‚Äôs corridors, rifle in hand, facing horrors that never ended. Yet they no longer woke screaming. Each time the nightmares returned, they found themselves snarling back at the phantoms. The spores in their systems had been neutralized, and the illusions were dwindling. Even so, the knowledge that something might still lurk beyond the remnants of that monolith‚Äîsome far-reaching hive‚Äîkept them vigilant.

Officials declared Outpost Theta‚Äôs entire region off-limits. A few remote surveillance drones scoured the planet‚Äôs surface, beaming back images of scorched rock and collapsed metal structures. A crater marked where the reactor meltdown tore the station apart. The storm still raged, lightning scarring the horizon. Sensors detected faint readings of the same psychic energy that had once assaulted the minds of the station‚Äôs crew. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the reading vanished‚Äîlike a mirage fading in a heat haze.

In the days that followed, hushed rumors claimed the entity‚Äôs consciousness had scattered among the stars, searching for other minds to devour. Others theorized it had gone dormant, waiting for another unsuspecting civilization to awaken it. Scientists examining alien script fragments taken from the dig site found repeated etchings that might mean ‚ÄúPrison,‚Äù ‚ÄúDespair,‚Äù or both. None could offer definitive answers, only speculations that the entire cosmos might be riddled with such traps, remnants of ancient wars. Earth‚Äôs own history had been shaped by conflict, so it felt inevitable that cosmic expansions would uncover something best left forgotten.

All the same, Earth refused to hide. The final lines in the official report read: ‚ÄúHumanity stands ready. If the dark wants to test our minds, we will respond with every emotion in our arsenal.‚Äù There was an unspoken irony that the very volatility humans had often criticized in themselves‚Äîan impulsive, combative streak that spawned centuries of warfare‚Äîmight serve as a shield against malevolent psychic forces.

As Jansen rested in a medical ward, monitors carefully watching his vitals, he studied his own reflection in the polished steel of a nearby cabinet. He saw the subtle lines of exhaustion on his face, the weight of everything they‚Äôd lost. Yet he also felt the faint ember of pride. He remembered the laughter of marines huddled around a table, boasting about humanity‚Äôs stubbornness, and the final image of Varga standing her ground against an abomination. Somehow, they had won‚Äîthough the cost was painfully high, and the war might only have begun.

Days later, he passed Dr. Cross in a corridor. She was wearing a bandage around her arm, dark circles under her eyes, but she nodded in greeting. They paused, uncertain whether to speak. Then they shared a brief, tired smile. Both understood that their story‚Äîof Outpost Theta, the monolith, and a defiance that burned hotter than fear‚Äîwasn‚Äôt over. In time, their superiors would likely call them back for further research or testimony. The thought of returning to that planet or encountering another of those entities sent a shiver through them. Yet they knew they wouldn‚Äôt run from it. There was nowhere left to run.

Before dawn the next day, a marine in a wheelchair arrived at the same corridor where Jansen and Cross stood. One of the few who made it out with grievous injuries, he had endured the entity‚Äôs nightmares with stoic endurance. Bandages wrapped his torso, and he grimaced with each breath. But when he heard the broadcast repeating Earth‚Äôs challenge into the void‚Äî‚ÄúCome hungry. Leave furious‚Äù‚Äîhe tilted his head back and let out a gravelly laugh. Jansen felt his own lips curl into a faint grin. Dr. Cross joined him in that subdued, mirthless amusement. It was the kind of laugh shared by people who had faced horror head-on and refused to crumble.

From there, Earth‚Äôs top brass took steps to fortify the system against future threats, establishing new protocols for unknown artifacts. But behind every official meeting and scientific briefing lay the seeds of an enduring question: if they had been forced to nuke an outpost just to escape a fraction of this entity, what else lurked in the cosmic void‚Äîwhat greater nightmares waited to be stirred? Despite the grim possibilities, humanity pressed on, forging alliances among its factions and preparing for the worst. The quarantine facility remained under tight security, though each day the patients within showed more signs of recovery. Blood tests confirmed that the spores were dead or expunged from the survivors‚Äô systems. Their immune responses, bolstered by adrenaline, seemed to have effectively purged the psychic infection.

No one was quite certain how to catalog this incident in the broader story of human expansion. It was at once a tragedy, a cautionary tale, and an unlikely triumph. The concept of a telepathic hive-mind that fed on fear was enough to terrify even the most veteran soldiers. Yet there was also a spark of savage joy in knowing that, in the final reckoning, the intruder had recoiled from the sheer virulence of human rage. Earth‚Äôs message into the cosmos felt half like a war cry, half like a nervous laugh in the dark. Some might call it arrogance, others necessary bravado. Only time would tell which it truly was.

Still, the nightmares did not simply vanish. Jansen woke many nights gasping, certain he felt the monolith‚Äôs hum resonating in his skull. Cross sometimes saw flickers in her peripheral vision, shapes that dissolved when she turned her head. The difference now was that these vestigial horrors held less power over them. Each had been tempered in that crucible of fear and emerged with a certain resilience. ‚ÄúWe are survivors,‚Äù Cross told him once, when she caught him staring at his shaking hands. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all we can ever be.‚Äù

In the end, the entire ordeal hovered between victory and catastrophe. They had survived long enough to carry the warning home, but the outpost was destroyed, and dozens of good people were lost‚Äîincluding Varga, who had defied the hive-mind in her final moments. The cosmic stage felt infinitely large, dotted with worlds where ancient powers might still lurk, waiting to feed. Yet humanity wouldn‚Äôt shrink from the challenge. There was no forgetting what happened on PX-731, nor any forgiving the nightmares it spawned. The last echoes of that monolith‚Äîits arcane symbols and the dreadful pulses that had once invaded human minds‚Äîreminded them that the universe was vaster and more malevolent than they had ever understood.

Nonetheless, those who listened to the official broadcast from Earth could almost picture a battered marine, fists clenched, daring the lurking darkness to strike again. ‚ÄúCome hungry,‚Äù the message repeated, static warping the edges of each syllable. ‚ÄúLeave furious.‚Äù It was a testament to defiance‚Äîone that might provoke new horrors or keep them at bay, no one could say. For now, it stood as the parting shot from a species both cunning and unbreakable.

Deep in the quarantine facility‚Äôs secured ward, Jansen turned off the broadcast and closed his eyes. In that quiet space, memories of black tendrils, stitched mouths, and the unearthly hush of a telepathic intruder flared behind his eyelids. In his mind‚Äôs ear, he heard the ghost of Captain Varga laughing, just once, at the raw absurdity of it all. The tragedies and heartbreak were undeniable, but so was the fact that humanity had survived a brush with an ancient terror. The storm had tried to swallow them, but they punched their way out‚Äîstubborn and half-mad, perhaps, but undeniably alive.

Eventually, Jansen drifted into a fitful sleep. Outside, dawn broke over Earth, painting the horizon in gold and pink. The planet carried on, unaware of how close it had come to hosting a nightmare. Soldiers guarded gates, scientists scanned for new threats, and somewhere, in that hushed light, someone else laughed in the face of the unknown. The cosmic prison that had once been a monolith lay shattered on a storm-blasted world, its occupant scattered‚Äîpossibly destroyed, possibly biding its time. And somewhere beyond the veil of stars, if any of the entity‚Äôs kin still drifted between worlds, they would have heard the brazen challenge. Let them come. Let them see how a creature that devours fear fares against a species that meets terror with ferocity.

In the halls of that quarantine facility, the laughter of a convalescent marine echoed, defiant and tinged with the madness of survival. It was as if, in that single sound, the entire human spirit called out to whatever was watching, promising to rage on through every cosmic storm."

What is Liquid Staking? And Why Should You Care?,DeFiYieldClub,1i8tbco,2025-01-24 06:29:02,9,1.0,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i8tbco/what_is_liquid_staking_and_why_should_you_care/,Solanafluent,,"Most people know staking..lock up your SOL, earn yield. But what if I told you there is a way to stake AND still use your assets in DeFi at the same time? That‚Äôs where liquid staking comes in.

Instead of locking up your SOL and letting it collect dust, liquid staking lets you stake while receiving a token (like vSOL, JitoSOL, mSOL, etc.) that you can use across DeFi.

üí° **How it works:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ You deposit SOL into a liquid staking protocol.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ You get back a liquid staking token (LST) that represents your staked SOL + rewards.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ You can now take that LST and use it in DeFi. Provide liquidity, borrow against it, loop it, or farm more yield.

üöÄ **Why it‚Äôs a game changer:**

* Boost your yield ‚Äì Instead of just earning staking rewards, you can earn multiple layers of yield by using your LST in DeFi.
* Stay liquid ‚Äì No need to wait for unstaking periods. If you want to exit, just swap your LST for SOL anytime.
* More composability ‚Äì Imagine staking SOL and still using it as collateral for a loan, providing liquidity, or even restaking in new opportunities.

üîó **Example:** Let‚Äôs say you stake SOL for vSOL. Now, instead of just earning \~8% APY from staking, you can take your vSOL and use it in lending, liquidity pools, or farms to stack even more rewards.

This is why LSTs are becoming a core part of yield-maximizing strategies in Solana DeFi.

Lyrics


L'avi Siset em parlava

De bon mat√≠ al portal,

Mentres el sol esper√†vem

I els carros v√®iem passar.

. 

Siset, que no veus l'estaca

A on estem tots lligats?

Si no podem desfer-nos-en

Mai no podrem caminar!

. 

Si estirem tots ella caur√†

I molt de temps no pot durar,

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba,

Ben corcada deu ser ja.

. 

Si tu l'estires fort per aqu√≠

I jo l'estiro fort per all√†,

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba

I ens podrem alliberar.

. 

Per√≤ Siset, fa molt temps ja

Les mans se'm van escorxant

I quan la for√ßa se me'n va

Ella es m√©s ample i m√©s gran.

. 

Ben cert s√© que est√† podrida

Pero √©s que, Siset, pesa tant

Que a cops la for√ßa m'oblida,

Torna'm a dir el teu cant

. 

Si estirem tots ella caur√†

I molt de temps no pot durar,

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba,

Ben corcada deu ser ja.

. 

Si tu l'estires fort per aqu√≠

I jo l'estiro fort per all√†,

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba

I ens podrem alliberar.

. 

L'avi Siset ja no diu res,

Mal vent que se'l va emportar,

Ell qui sap cap a quin indret

I jo a sota el portal.

. 

I, passen els nous vailets,

Estiro el coll per cantar 

El darrer cant d'en Siset,

El darrer que em va ensenyar.

. 

Si estirem tots ella caur√†

I molt de temps no pot durar,

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba,

Ben corcada deu ser ja.

. 

Si tu l'estires fort per aqu√≠

I jo l'estiro fort per all√†,

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba

I ens podrem alliberar.

. 

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba

I ens podrem alliberar.

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba

I ens podrem alliberar.

. 

Si tu l'estires fort per aqu√≠

I jo l'estiro fort per all√†,

Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba

I ens podrem alliberar.

# üéä Market-Driven Emissions Proposal

Solana's current inflation mechanism uses a fixed emissions schedule to reward validators and stakers who maintain the network's security.¬†

This schedule began with an 8% annual inflation rate at the network's launch, designed to incentivize early participation. This rate decreases by 15% each year and is expected to stabilize at 1.5% around 2030.

Validators play a key role, receiving newly issued SOL for validating transactions and sharing these rewards with stakers who delegate their tokens.¬†

These rewards are composed not only of emissions but also of transaction fees and Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which validators earn by strategically ordering transactions.

The fixed emissions schedule, while providing predictability, has limitations.¬†It doesn't adapt to changing network conditions, meaning token issuance remains constant regardless of the economic climate or staking levels.¬†

This rigidity was less of a concern when Solana was nascent and needed to attract validators. However, as the network matured, validators became less reliant on token emissions for income, supplementing it with MEV and transaction fees.

The current model continues to benefit stakers through emissions but dilutes the value of SOL held by non-stakers. This has raised concerns about inflation's impact on SOL's overall utility and attractiveness.

The proposed governance change,¬†[SIMD-0228](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/5c9c06daddfb35b6dd9a9317bfa58ac2e52aee0f/proposals/0228-market-based-emission-mechanism.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org), introduces Smart Emissions, aiming to make inflation rates more responsive to real-time network conditions.¬†

The proposal sets a target staking participation rate of 50%, calculated as the total staked SOL divided by the circulating supply.

* If staking participation falls below 50%, the network would increase token emissions to incentivize more staking and bolster security.
* Conversely, if staking participation exceeds 50%, emissions would decrease to mitigate inflationary pressure and reduce staking rewards.

This adjustment would be programmatic, automatically responding to changes in staking levels.

The proposal includes upper and lower bounds for emissions.¬†

The upper bound would align with Solana's current inflation schedule, preventing excessive emissions. The lower bound would allow emissions to temporarily drop to zero if staking participation consistently surpasses the target.¬†

This flexibility allows the network to adapt without over-issuing tokens.

If implemented, this proposal could significantly alter Solana's economic dynamics. Validators and stakers might experience reduced rewards, especially if MEV revenue doesn't fully compensate for lower emissions.¬†

However, overall inflation would likely decrease, and SOL could even become deflationary over time, mitigating dilution for non-stakers and potentially improving $SOL's utility in DeFi.

This shift would mark a significant evolution in Solana's monetary policy, transitioning from fixed schedules to a more flexible and responsive model.

# ü§ñ Solana Virtual Machine

This deep-dive into Solana's SVM compares its multi-threaded, parallel processing capabilities to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), highlighting their fundamental differences and implications for developers.

It also talks about the key role of Sealevel, the technology that enables Solana to process transactions concurrently, and explains how localized fee markets further distinguish Solana from Ethereum‚Äôs global fee model.

For Solana developers, understanding the SVM is key to appreciating how its architecture supports dApps with unmatched efficiency.

By utilizing the full capacity of validator hardware, the SVM offers a game-changing alternative to the single-threaded EVM, which struggles with bottlenecks during peak demand.

This article will help deepen your understanding of what sets Solana apart from other blockchains and how the SVM opens new possibilities for dApp development.

# üí∞ Multicoin's Solana Thesis

Multicoin Capital‚Äôs latest thesis, authored by Kyle Samani, examines how Solana can play a central role in building what they describe as Internet Capital Markets.¬†

The report focuses on how Solana‚Äôs technology and ecosystem have matured to address challenges in finance, with an emphasis on efficiency, accessibility, and scalability.

Since its early days in 2018, Solana has grown significantly, now valued at $100 billion.¬†

It has one of the fastest-growing developer ecosystems and has surpassed Ethereum in several key metrics, including trading volumes and daily active addresses.¬†

Multicoin views Solana as a platform capable of outperforming TradFi systems, not just on cost and speed, but also by retaining blockchain-native features like permissionless access and composability.

A central argument is that Solana has the potential to reduce financial services fees by up to 99% while still increasing its market cap to exceed major financial incumbents.

The thesis explains that while payments are not a primary revenue driver for blockchains, they are essential for adoption.

Solana‚Äôs transaction fees are extremely low, making it far cheaper than traditional payment systems. This affordability, coupled with its ease of use, encourages the growth of wallet adoption and ecosystem engagement.

Some of the key factors that Kyle highlights in this report are:¬†

* Introduction of Conditional Liquidity to tighten spreads and reduce risks for market makers
* Implementation of Multiple Concurrent Leaders to decentralize price discovery and reduce latency
* Capable of handling traditional assets, crypto-native assets, and new financial instruments
* Revenue and Value Growth Through MEV
* Expanding Total Addressable Market¬†
* Expected to play a larger role in global finance as blockchain adoption grows

The report describes Solana‚Äôs broader goal as creating a permissionless financial system that integrates low fees, global accessibility, real-time auditability, and composability.¬†

While Solana serves as the infrastructure, its ecosystem is designed to support¬† both traditional and crypto-native assets while enabling new market opportunities.

Ahoy Crew!

Another week in *radio silence*, without updates or fixes, which continue to be the subject of players' debate almost everywhere. *There is a sense of disappointment, and it couldn't be otherwise...* as enthusiasts of **Elite Dangerous**, here it is (for the umpteenth time) a *request* to **FDEV** to act as soon as possible!

**M.E.G.A.**

On **GalNet** there is still very little talk about Powerplay, [today only a short update was released](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/6790fd172dc3591eeb089f37)... and it's a missed opportunity for the game (and its lore) because the coverage on the fierce confrontation between the **Federation** and the **Empire** around **Sol** had given rise to hope (~~for the better!~~).

Despite the framework remains peppered with *unbalanced stuff* and *bugs*, the 12 **Powers** continued to work on their strategies... the [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteArcher/comments/1i2xoky/tensions_in_luhman_16_torvals_forces_faces/) about **Luhman 16**, a tiny military system located in the **Sol** area, contextualizes the events. The system remained in the hands of granny **Torval** after the collapse of **Federation** control in the area and was finally *liberated* last Cycle... and it is already clear that **Jerome Acher** is more than keen to take it back (~~a further confirmation of the dynamism of the new framework~~).

A push and pull which in this Cycle also involved some systems where **Archon Delaine** had stakes. The capture of **LTT 198**, [which occurred last Cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/kumocrew/comments/1i2o051/cycle_ii11_discord_no_more/), had shaken the hearts of the **Empire** and with a final broadside (~~a 270k-sh snipe bomb~~) they managed to drive out **Delaine**'s pirates (~~for now~~). There was no shortage of engagements both in space and on the ground, as recorded by the fellow **Kumo Crew** boatswain **CMDR Benito Stone** in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t-19osbT_w).

The fate of **LTT 198**, however, is yet to be written.

For one lost system, **Archon Delaine** took six new ones... including **Parthians**, where the **King of Pirates** emerged victorious from a confrontation with the bear **Grom** that remained uncertain until the end (sporadic, but fun, pews [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDI0VFY8kT8)). Some undermining tentatives against **Chang Kuo Lao** and **8 Kappa Piscium** were countered. For its part, the *mustachioed bear* has taken possession of a bunch of close systems (**Kongkomisso**, **HIP 103311** and **Lenca**). **Antal**'s technonerds continue to be very active on **Delaine**'s frontlines, but their new acquisitions (like **Idununn**) do not represent a threat... finally, the commitment to **LTT 198** has then evidently taken strength away from the gelatinous haired **Patreus** who has opted for consolidate (e.g. **Gliese 9029** and **Nu Kuni**) and nailed an acquisition snipe on **UGP 619** (which Delaine was controlling few Cycles earlier).

Shifting the focus on the new **Cycle 13**: **Archon Delaine**'s fellow scallywags are going to be busy with reinforcements for these new acquisitions (among their priorities as usual), as well as preventing enemy attempts to weaken the frontlines. Consistently with this strategy, +3 strongholds and +1 fortified have been also added.

[GetGrass](https://app.getgrass.io/register/?referralCode=VjkRtOc26aJ5LeI) is a bandwidth sharing application that for a while was preparing for launch, and the GRASS token is now live! It can be either sold, exchanged for other currencies or staked. Works pretty much the same way as all other such apps, simply download and let it run in the background. 

To receive payments, you will need to have an existing cryptocurrency wallet such as Phantom. From there, you can swap it to something like SOL and then transfer the funds to a cryptocurrency exchange of your choice where it can be sold for fiat currency.

**Important notice for those who participated in Phase 1 but didn't connect wallet before the deadline**: All Phase 1 earnings will be distributed once Phase 2 is over, but make sure to not forget to connect the wallet by the next deadline!

NOTE: Requires a bit of existing SOL (about $1) in your wallet already when claiming in order to cover any transaction fees.

VANCOUVER, BC , Jan. 22, 2025 /CNW/ - **NGEx Minerals Ltd. (""NGEx"", ""NGEx Minerals"" or the ""Company"")** (TSX: NGEX) (OTCQX: NGXXF)¬†is pleased to provide the second update on its ongoing Phase 3 drill program at the 100% owned Lunahuasi high-grade copper-gold-silver project in San Juan, Argentina mid-October 2024 , and six diamond drill rigs are currently working on the project. Due to positive initial results from the program, two additional drills are scheduled to be added in February, and the planned program has been expanded from 20,000m to 25,000m

This news release includes partial results received to date for five holes, as indicated in Table 2 below. Results from the upper parts of DPDH024 and DPDH025 were released on December 18, 2024

**Highlights**

* Drillhole **DPDH024** intersected:
   * **7.40m at 5.81% copper equivalent (""CuEq"")** from 715.00m
* Drillhole **DPDH025** intersected:
   * **29.80m at 4.80%¬†CuEq** from 369.05m , including:
      * **5.74m at 21.22%¬†CuEq** from 372.45m **(19.13 g/t gold)**
* Drillhole **DPDH026** intersected:
   * **21.50m at 3.07%¬†CuEq** from 529.20m , including:
      * **2.40m at 17.47%¬†CuEq** from 529.20m
* Drillhole **DPDH028** intersected:
   * **2.00m at 11.82%¬†CuEq** from 230.10m **(10.13 g/t gold)** , plus:
   * **205.35m at 5.08%¬†CuEq** from 378.50m **(3.20 g/t gold)** , including:
      * **51.10m at 13.84%¬†CuEq** from 464.30m **(9.70 g/t gold)** , including
      * **7.20m at 13.93%¬†CuEq** from 542.50m

Wojtek Wodzicki , President and CEO, commented, *""Lunahuasi continues to surprise to the upside and deliver some of the best copper-gold intercepts in the world. DPDH028 is a remarkable hole which is a significant step-out below previous drilling and includes the widest high-grade copper-gold intercept to date, with results for the final 1,000m of the hole still pending. Furthermore, it is becoming evident that Lunahuasi is also a very significant gold deposit with intervals and grades that rival those from known high-grade gold deposits. The deposit remains open in all directions and step-out drilling to expand the known zones and test for a porphyry source to the west remains a top priority. We are highly encouraged by the results to date and have decided to expand the program from 20,000m to 25,000m by adding two additional drill rigs which will bring the total to eight. The $175 million financing completed in October, 2024 provides full flexibility to adjust the program as results are received. With the drill program in full swing, we expect to be able to release a steady flow of results well into mid-year.""*

**DPDH024** was collared from the same platform as DPDH014 and drilled at -58 degrees towards the west in order to test for an extension to the high-grade zone in hole 14 and for extensions to other mineralized structures to the north and at depth. The main zone in hole 14 appears to have been intersected over 12.3m from 139.8m to 152.0m (22.35% CuEq; 9.36% Cu, 18.16 g/t Au, 84.7 g/t Ag ‚Äì see News Release from December 18, 2024 ). The hole went on to intersect several other structures including those noted in the Table 1. This hole has been completed and assays from 757.0m to the end of the hole at 968.0m are pending.

**DPDH025** was collared 50m to the north of hole 24, on the same platform as DPDH012 and drilled at -45 degrees towards the west to test for northern extensions to the mineralized structures. An intersection of 11.9m at 10.74% CuEq (8.00% Cu, 3.02 g/t Au, 61.4 g/t Ag - see News Release from December 18, 2024 ) is interpreted as the northern extension of the zone intersected in DPDH014 and is 105m away. A particularly strong intersection at 372.45m ( 5.74m at 21.22% CuEq) includes 19.13 g/t gold. This hole has been completed and assays from 652.0m to the end of the hole at 1,303.8m are pending.

**DPDH026** was collared 216m to the east of DPDH014 and drilled towards the west at -60 degrees to test for the down-dip extension of the mineralized structures. Several structures were intersected as shown in Table 1. All intersections above 400m depth appear to be new structures which lie to the east of anything intersected by previous drilling. This hole has been completed and assays from 553.0m to the end of the hole at 1,261.2m are pending.

**DPDH027** was collared from the same platform as DPDH021, which was the southernmost hole prior to this season's program, and drilled at -46 degrees towards the WSW (226 degrees) in order to test for a southern extension to the numerous mineralized structures seen in DPDH021. Only a few weakly mineralized structures are indicated by the assay results received so far, but assays from 459.0m to the end of the hole at 1,192.0m are pending. This hole is still in progress.

**DPDH028** was collared from the same platform as DPDH022 and drilled towards the west at -53 degrees in order to undercut hole 22 and test the down-dip extension of the structures intersected by it. A major structure intersected from 378.5m in this hole correlates well with a similar interval in DPDH022 from 380.0m 8.2m interval at 39.11 g/t gold with a best sample of 1.5m at 115.00 g/t gold in DPDH028 and two samples over 70 g/t gold within a 38.9m interval at 10.09 g/t from 408.0m in DPDH022. This very high-grade zone also correlates well with an intersection 120m away to the south in DPDH021 of 4.8m at 24.34 g/t gold from 480.5m (see News Release dated June 9, 2024 ). This hole has been completed and assays from 588.0m to the end of the hole at 1,600.4m are pending.

Six drill rigs are currently turning at Lunahuasi with five holes completed and just over 9,500m drilled, the details of which are presented in Table 2. Details of assay intervals completed by news release date are presented in Table 3. Additional intersections will be released once assays are received, analyzed, and confirmed by the Company.

**Qualified Persons and Technical Notes**

The scientific and technical disclosure included in this news release have been reviewed and approved by Bob Carmichael , B.A.Sc., P.Eng. who is the Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Carmichael is Vice President, Exploration for the Company.

Samples were cut at NGEx's operations base in San Juan, Argentina by Company personnel. Diamond drill core was sawed and then sampled in maximum 2-meter intervals, stopping at geological boundaries. Core diameter is a mix of PQ, HQ and NQ depending on the depth of the drill hole. Samples were bagged, tagged and packaged for shipment by truck to the ALS preparation laboratory in Mendoza, Argentina where they were crushed and a 500g split was pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh. The prepared sample splits were sent to the ALS assay laboratory in either Lima, Peru or Santiago, Chile for copper, gold and silver assays, and multi-element ICP. ALS is an accredited laboratory which is independent of the Company. Gold assays were by fire assay fusion with AAS finish on a 30g sample. Copper and silver were assayed by atomic absorption following a 4-acid digestion. Samples were also analyzed for a suite of 48 elements with ME-MS61 plus mercury. Copper and gold standards as well as blanks and duplicates (field, preparation, and analysis) were randomly inserted into the sampling sequence for Quality Control. On average, 9% of the submitted samples are Quality Control samples. No data quality problems were indicated by the QA/QC program.

Copper equivalent (CuEq) for drill intersections is calculated based on US$3.00 /lb Cu, US$1,500 /oz Au and US$18 /oz Ag, with 80% metallurgical recoveries assumed for all metals. The formula is: CuEq % = Cu % + (0.7292 \* Au g/t) + (0.0088 \* Ag g/t).

True widths are rounded to the nearest metre for widths over 10 m and to the nearest 0.1 m for widths less than 10 m , as this better reflects the precision of the estimates. True widths should be regarded as approximate as these are derived from an estimation that uses a preliminary interpretation of the geological model and are subject to change as more information becomes available.

Core scanning and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our core logging and geological interpretation processes is being implemented to improve workflows for more routine tasks and to give geologists more time for targeting and interpretation.

# Smoky Arena: Pioneering Crypto Gaming

The second flagship product, Smoky Arena, is a turn-based Player vs. Environment (PvE) battle game featuring unique dogs with distinct abilities and rarities. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek into its exciting features:

# Dog Rarities:

* Common: 20 varieties.
* Rare: 15 varieties.

# Core Gameplay:

* Stages: Select stages with increasing difficulty. Completing a stage rewards players with experience, gear, Storepoints, and tickets.

Earned through staking or bought at fixed rates, Storepoints are used to purchase mystery boxes that contain gear, runes, and even rare dog skins.

# Why Smoky Stands Out

1. Transparency and Trust: With a doxxed team and a registered company, Smoky builds credibility in a space often plagued by anonymity.
2. Versatile Ecosystem: The integration of staking, gaming, and utility tokens creates multiple avenues for engagement and value creation.
3. Innovative Rewards: Dynamic staking rewards and a play-to-earn model ensure that users benefit from holding and engaging with the ecosystem.
4. Fair: Smoky opted for a fair launch on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun), ensuring an equitable distribution with no presale or private allocation. This approach reinforces the project's transparency and its commitment to engaging the community from day one.

# Conclusion

Smoky is not just another crypto project; it's a well-rounded ecosystem with real utility and a clear vision. Whether you‚Äôre a staking enthusiast or a gamer looking for the next big crypto game, Smoky has something to offer. With Smoky Bank launching this week and Smoky Arena on the horizon, now is the perfect time to dive in and explore this promising project.

* Stages: Select stages with increasing difficulty. Completing a stage rewards players with experience, gear, Storepoints, and tickets.
* Runes and Gear: Equip powerful runes from mystery boxes to boost your dogs‚Äô performance. Gear can be earned through stages, with stats depending on drop rates.
* Energy Cost: Entering a stage costs 500 $SMOKY.

# Unique Abilities:

With over 18 different attack types, Smoky Arena offers rich strategic gameplay. Examples include:

* Life Steal: Recover health equal to a percentage of the damage dealt.
* Burn AOE: Apply fire damage to all enemies, causing health loss over time.
* Revenant: Revive with 50% health upon death.
* Energy Steal: Drain energy from enemies to fuel your team‚Äôs attacks.

Players can level up their dogs, earn rewards, and participate in an interactive ecosystem that ties into Smoky‚Äôs broader utility.

# The Role of Storepoints and Tickets

Storepoints play a crucial role in the Smoky ecosystem. Earned through staking or bought at fixed rates, Storepoints are used to purchase mystery boxes that contain gear, runes, and even rare dog skins. Additionally, tickets earned from completing stages can be redeemed for exclusive rewards across the Smoky ecosystem.

# Why Smoky Stands Out

1. Transparency and Trust: With a doxxed team and a registered company, Smoky builds credibility in a space often plagued by anonymity.
2. Versatile Ecosystem: The integration of staking, gaming, and utility tokens creates multiple avenues for engagement and value creation.
3. Innovative Rewards: Dynamic staking rewards and a play-to-earn model ensure that users benefit from holding and engaging with the ecosystem.
4. Fair: Smoky opted for a fair launch on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun), ensuring an equitable distribution with no presale or private allocation. This approach reinforces the project's transparency and its commitment to engaging the community from day one.

# Conclusion

Smoky is not just another crypto project; it's a well-rounded ecosystem with real utility and a clear vision. Whether you‚Äôre a staking enthusiast or a gamer looking for the next big crypto game, Smoky has something to offer. With Smoky Bank launching this week and Smoky Arena on the horizon, now is the perfect time to dive in and explore this promising project.

With a team of doxxed developers from Europe (notably France and Norway) and the USA, Smoky is backed by a legitimate company registered in Norway. This article takes a closer look at their ecosystem and upcoming products, which could be game-changers in the crypto space.

# Smoky Bank: Revolutionizing Staking

Launching this week, Smoky Bank is a cutting-edge staking platform that offers users the opportunity to stake multiple tokens, starting with their native token, $SMOKY, and liquidity pairs like SMOKY/SOL. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about their staking pools:

* 90-day lock: 150 Storepoints/day/million $SMOKY (\~90% APR at $0.58).

For the SMOKY/SOL liquidity pools:

* No lock: 100 Storepoints/day/million (\~60% APR at $0.58).
* 30-day lock: 125 Storepoints/day/million (\~75% APR at $0.58).
* 60-day lock: 150 Storepoints/day/million (\~90% APR at $0.58).
* 90-day lock: 225 Storepoints/day/million (\~135% APR at $0.58).

Key Highlights:

* Dynamic Rewards: Ratios will be adjusted based on $SMOKY's market price to ensure competitive APRs. Updates will be communicated transparently.
* Zero Fees: No deposit or withdrawal fees, only standard gas fees.
* Flexibility: Stake in multiple pools without limitations.

Storepoints, the staking rewards, are priced at $0.99 per 1,000 and can be used across the Smoky ecosystem, particularly in their next big product‚ÄîSmoky Arena.

# Smoky Arena: Pioneering Crypto Gaming

The second flagship product, Smoky Arena, is a turn-based Player vs. Environment (PvE) battle game featuring unique dogs with distinct abilities and rarities. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek into its exciting features:

# Dog Rarities:

* Common: 20 varieties.
* Rare: 15 varieties.
* Epic: 10 varieties.
* Legendary: 5 varieties.
* Mythic: Limited-edition skins for special events.

Each dog comes with unique attacks, which fall into categories like normal attacks, healing, life steal, bleed effects, and more. Players can assemble a team of up to four dogs, each with specialized roles like tanks, supports, and damage dealers.

# Core Gameplay:

* Stages: Select stages with increasing difficulty. Completing a stage rewards players with experience, gear, Storepoints, and tickets.
* Runes and Gear: Equip powerful runes from mystery boxes to boost your dogs‚Äô performance. Gear can be earned through stages, with stats depending on drop rates.
* Energy Cost: Entering a stage costs 500 $SMOKY.

# Unique Abilities:

With over 18 different attack types, Smoky Arena offers rich strategic gameplay. Examples include:

* Life Steal: Recover health equal to a percentage of the damage dealt.
* Burn AOE: Apply fire damage to all enemies, causing health loss over time.
* Revenant: Revive with 50% health upon death.
* Energy Steal: Drain energy from enemies to fuel your team‚Äôs attacks.

Players can level up their dogs, earn rewards, and participate in an interactive ecosystem that ties into Smoky‚Äôs broader utility.

# The Role of Storepoints and Tickets

Storepoints play a crucial role in the Smoky ecosystem. Earned through staking or bought at fixed rates, Storepoints are used to purchase mystery boxes that contain gear, runes, and even rare dog skins. Additionally, tickets earned from completing stages can be redeemed for exclusive rewards across the Smoky ecosystem.

* 90-day lock: 225 Storepoints/day/million (\~135% APR at $0.58).

Key Highlights:

* Dynamic Rewards: Ratios will be adjusted based on $SMOKY's market price to ensure competitive APRs. Updates will be communicated transparently.
* Zero Fees: No deposit or withdrawal fees, only standard gas fees.
* Flexibility: Stake in multiple pools without limitations.

Storepoints, the staking rewards, are priced at $0.99 per 1,000 and can be used across the Smoky ecosystem, particularly in their next big product‚ÄîSmoky Arena.

# Smoky Arena: Pioneering Crypto Gaming

The second flagship product, Smoky Arena, is a turn-based Player vs. Environment (PvE) battle game featuring unique dogs with distinct abilities and rarities. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek into its exciting features:

# Dog Rarities:

* Common: 20 varieties.
* Rare: 15 varieties.
* Epic: 10 varieties.
* Legendary: 5 varieties.
* Mythic: Limited-edition skins for special events.

Each dog comes with unique attacks, which fall into categories like normal attacks, healing, life steal, bleed effects, and more. Players can assemble a team of up to four dogs, each with specialized roles like tanks, supports, and damage dealers.

# Core Gameplay:

* Stages: Select stages with increasing difficulty. Completing a stage rewards players with experience, gear, Storepoints, and tickets.
* Runes and Gear: Equip powerful runes from mystery boxes to boost your dogs‚Äô performance. Gear can be earned through stages, with stats depending on drop rates.
* Energy Cost: Entering a stage costs 500 $SMOKY.

# Unique Abilities:

With over 18 different attack types, Smoky Arena offers rich strategic gameplay. Examples include:

* Life Steal: Recover health equal to a percentage of the damage dealt.
* Burn AOE: Apply fire damage to all enemies, causing health loss over time.
* Revenant: Revive with 50% health upon death.
* Energy Steal: Drain energy from enemies to fuel your team‚Äôs attacks.

Players can level up their dogs, earn rewards, and participate in an interactive ecosystem that ties into Smoky‚Äôs broader utility.

# The Role of Storepoints and Tickets

Storepoints play a crucial role in the Smoky ecosystem. Earned through staking or bought at fixed rates, Storepoints are used to purchase mystery boxes that contain gear, runes, and even rare dog skins. Additionally, tickets earned from completing stages can be redeemed for exclusive rewards across the Smoky ecosystem.

# Why Smoky Stands Out

1. Transparency and Trust: With a doxxed team and a registered company, Smoky builds credibility in a space often plagued by anonymity.
2. Versatile Ecosystem: The integration of staking, gaming, and utility tokens creates multiple avenues for engagement and value creation.
3. Innovative Rewards: Dynamic staking rewards and a play-to-earn model ensure that users benefit from holding and engaging with the ecosystem.
4. Fair: Smoky opted for a fair launch on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun), ensuring an equitable distribution with no presale or private allocation. This approach reinforces the project's transparency and its commitment to engaging the community from day one.

# Conclusion

Smoky is not just another crypto project; it's a well-rounded ecosystem with real utility and a clear vision. Whether you‚Äôre a staking enthusiast or a gamer looking for the next big crypto game, Smoky has something to offer. With Smoky Bank launching this week and Smoky Arena on the horizon, now is the perfect time to dive in and explore this promising project.

# Why Smoky Stands Out

1. Transparency and Trust: With a doxxed team and a registered company, Smoky builds credibility in a space often plagued by anonymity.
2. Versatile Ecosystem: The integration of staking, gaming, and utility tokens creates multiple avenues for engagement and value creation.
3. Innovative Rewards: Dynamic staking rewards and a play-to-earn model ensure that users benefit from holding and engaging with the ecosystem.
4. Fair: Smoky opted for a fair launch on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun), ensuring an equitable distribution with no presale or private allocation. This approach reinforces the project's transparency and its commitment to engaging the community from day one.

# Conclusion

Smoky is not just another crypto project; it's a well-rounded ecosystem with real utility and a clear vision. Whether you‚Äôre a staking enthusiast or a gamer looking for the next big crypto game, Smoky has something to offer. With Smoky Bank launching this week and Smoky Arena on the horizon, now is the perfect time to dive in and explore this promising project.

# Smoky Arena: Pioneering Crypto Gaming

The second flagship product, Smoky Arena, is a turn-based Player vs. Environment (PvE) battle game featuring unique dogs with distinct abilities and rarities. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek into its exciting features:

# Dog Rarities:

* Common: 20 varieties.
* Rare: 15 varieties.
* Epic: 10 varieties.
* Legendary: 5 varieties.
* Mythic: Limited-edition skins for special events.

# Core Gameplay:

* Stages: Select stages with increasing difficulty. Completing a stage rewards players with experience, gear, Storepoints, and tickets.
* Runes and Gear: Equip powerful runes from mystery boxes to boost your dogs‚Äô performance. Gear can be earned through stages, with stats depending on drop rates.
* Energy Cost: Entering a stage costs 500 $SMOKY.

# Unique Abilities:

With over 18 different attack types, Smoky Arena offers rich strategic gameplay. Examples include:

* Life Steal: Recover health equal to a percentage of the damage dealt.

Additionally, tickets earned from completing stages can be redeemed for exclusive rewards across the Smoky ecosystem.
