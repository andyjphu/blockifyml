Moscato jelly with peach slices topped with berry granita,VeganFoodPorn,1i9x16f,2025-01-25 16:05:24,5,0.86,0,https://i.redd.it/1p0y5t6yf7fe1.jpeg,the70sartist,,"I am often at a loss for dessert ideas especially when having omnis over. This is an easy but impressive dessert that can be prepared a couple of days ahead. 

You can really try a whole bunch of combinations of alcohol or non alcoholic jelly (made with agar agar) and fruits. Think of cold brew tea made in to jelly, or coffee jelly, or something like a mojito but in jelly and sorbet/granita format. "

I've been watching some gameplay videos, and the movement and gunplay feels about what I am looking for. MW3 and BO6 are wayyyyyy too fast for me. It always feels so cracked out and the omni movement stuff is just silly.

Just wondering your opinions!"

How much dps am I really losing by using featherweight with two heavies as an evade rapier instead of attuned pants?,newworldgame,1i9w53j,2025-01-25 15:26:08,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1i9w53j/how_much_dps_am_i_really_losing_by_using/,BurgundySwanson,Discussion,"I started off with featherweight with two heavy pieces because I already had it and I liked the idea of more armor. Built around that, I’ve cleared hive and have Omni and leeching flurry in current armor. Pieces consist of azoth crystal and the two heavies are frigid. I understand attuned leather pants are the optimal route, but is the dps increase really worth spending the matrix resources to change out my current gear and replace it with pieces that fit the attuned pants route? Especially since I’m already in hive clearing groups and would presumably aim for gear from there long term.

Simply, is the dps increase significantly noticeable enough to switch to attuned pants at the cost of matrixes and dense materia if I’m already in high end preraid light setup with featherweight?"

Looking for either handgaurd in the 12"" range before I go and buy a brand new one. Would need the barrel nut and shims if possible as is seems they are always out of stock. Looking to spend under $175

Hook a brother up! I'd rather give you guys money than the tax man! I also have some stuff I could trade towards them, red dot (Sig Romeo 5XDR gen 2 $150), 5.56 barrels (12.5"",14.5"",16"")$100 or even a complete 7.62x39 upper $160

ChannelPartner.TV Announces Acceleration of Ultra AI Video Network Platform Integrating GPT-4o (Omni) with “Kill Switch” - Coming Soon.,ChannelPartners,1i9u822,2025-01-25 14:02:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChannelPartners/comments/1i9u822/channelpartnertv_announces_acceleration_of_ultra/,crosstalk914,,"We reviewed earlier versions of GTP and found them to be lacking and even this new release is still focused too much on text, however they had added “omni” features such as video, audio, graphics and other content forms.  

As OpenAI noted, “GPT-4o is trained on a single new model with end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network.” 

Because GPT-4o is a leading model combining all of these modalities, we believe it is time to accelerate our own AI efforts along with our existing AI development TECHtionary features in [ChannelPartner.TV](http://ChannelPartner.TV) based on decades of research and development which can be found in MindMeld-Merging Mental and Metal called the “best business book on AI” and can be found on [AIuserforum.com](http://aiuserforum.com/)

Seeking a Higher Level of Governance and Compliance

There are many pitfalls as we see it relying upon another new and relatively untested platform which will also be the focus of cybersecurity attacks from all directions as GPT represents a new business operating system (BOS).  As such we have built in a “kill switch” to disconnect GPT from the platform data should the need arise and plan to only use this to protect user/customer data. This concept is also recommended for other applications a customer may have in order to achieve a higher level of governance and compliance.

Background 

ChannelPartner.TV is, as far as we can find, the world’s largest channel news video news network now with more than 2,000 quick videos designed to provide “just enough - just in time” breaking news and highlights from more than 1,800 companies worldwide.  ChannelPartner.TV is a private label version of the Ultra video network from SocialStreamingTV with a fast array of features with newsfeed, video streaming consisting of up to 55 multi-channel video streaming and ondemand videos, 

news feeds and unlimited context library with one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one video, and ""Captain's Log"" personal video recording, along with the world's first website ""Video DoorBell"" video chat, digital business cards, virtual events - webinar features, learning management system (LMS), CRM, action-icon “acticons” calendar system, TECHtionary AI-driven content search system, chatbot and many more features that can be found on [SocialStreamingTV.com](http://SocialStreamingTV.com)

Another incredible session of the Howler Project 's 'Way of Stains',redrising,1i9u2p1,2025-01-25 13:56:17,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/redrising/comments/1i9u2p1/another_incredible_session_of_the_howler_project/,Little-Preparation-2,MS Spoilers,"This week, we finished Part II of 'Morning Star'. The theme and objective this week were: Rage, its manifestations, and consequences. We explored the dynamics of anger, fear, trust, friendship, and personal growth amidst turmoil.

We engaged in a lively discussion about what Howler Rule #1 means to each of the students individually. We discussed the difference between control and leadership. There was even a brief conversation on the sociology of wolves as we discussed the meaning behind ""Omnis vir Lupus.""

Ultimately, this week was about looking beyond the surface of things, trying to understand the origins of our pain and exploring tools for managing our responses.

I was stopped after class by one of my students who just wanted to thank me for bringing this program to the prison. In the first few weeks, he didn't really understand what we were doing, but now that we've gotten deep into the story, he sees the value in being able to project his feelings onto this fictional landscape and take lessons and inspiration from these incredible characters. ""I'm not gonna lie,"" he told the class. ""I cried."" This from a man who has served more than 20 years in prison. From a man who once saw himself as a monster, and now he sees something more. 

I'd like to think that Ragnar is looking on from the Vale and smiling at the work we're doing.

Stay Feral,
Howl on!

How to use AI to summarize a long document or a book (Fast and Easy!),GPTHackers,1i9twgh,2025-01-25 13:48:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTHackers/comments/1i9twgh/how_to_use_ai_to_summarize_a_long_document_or_a/,Accomplished_Gur576,Daily Life,"Tools like ChatGPT, SummarizeBot, and OmniGPT are AI-powered summarization tools that have changed the way people consume information. These tools can quickly analyze lengthy reports, books, or research papers and give concise summaries of the main points. This way, you can save your time, shift your focus to important information, and improve your working process. Here’s how to use AI for summarization correctly.

# Step 1: Uploading or Entering the Document

Most of the AI tools, including ChatGPT, SummarizeBot, or Resoomer, enable you to either upload a file or copy-paste the text. First, find the document or the book that you want to summarize and ensure that it is in a compatible format (Word, PDF, or text). Once the document is uploaded, the tool will search for the main ideas in the text.

# Step 2: Defining the Focus

Before creating the summary, it is important to know what one wants to achieve. For example, do you want to know the general recommendations, the overall message, or more specific actions that should be taken? In most cases, AI tools allow you to customize this by providing a specific prompt, such as ""Please summarize this report in five recommendations.

# Step 3: Creating the Summary

After uploading your document and entering your focus, the AI tool works its magic. In just a few seconds, it can break down a 5-page report to:

1. Adopt a new workflow to help prevent delays in projects.
2. Recommend changes to the budget to focus on high impact areas.
3. Concentrate on employee training to enhance efficiency across all teams.
4. Develop customer feedback mechanisms that can help in the development of new products.
5. Define and plan clearer communication channels for cross department collaboration. Not

only does the tool help you save time but also ensures that you don’t miss any important points.

# Step 4: Refine the Outcomes

Summaries produced by AI are quite accurate but may need some fine-tuning to fit your requirements. Quickly glance over the summary to ensure that it has captured the main points of the document. If necessary, add more detail or alter the information to suit your objectives or audience. This final step helps in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the information.

# Step 5: Applying the Summary

Now that you have the document in its concise form, it is best to use it correctly. Share the summary with your team, present it at a meeting, or use it as a basis for your decision. The goal is to do it quickly, without missing the crucial points.

# Conclusion

The use of AI tools has made the process of summarizing documents very simple. Instead of spending several hours reading through pages of information, it is possible to focus on the information that is being conveyed. Whether it is a work report or a dense book, AI can relieve you of much of the unnecessary work. Try it, and you will see how much time and energy you can free up."

Can Karabiner Map a Key Sequence to Trigger Actions?,Karabiner,1i9tbgt,2025-01-25 13:23:16,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Karabiner/comments/1i9tbgt/can_karabiner_map_a_key_sequence_to_trigger/,grooviekenn,,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been using Karabiner for several years and am ready to dive into creating my first complex modification. However, after reviewing the manual, I’m starting to wonder if what I want to do is even possible.

Here’s what I’m trying to accomplish:

I want to map a sequence of key presses to trigger specific actions in OmniFocus, using Keyboard Maestro (KBM) as the final step.

My Setup

In OmniFocus, I have three groups of tags:
	•	Priority Tags (4 options)
	•	Impact Tags (3 options)
	•	Low Tags (3 options)

When OmniFocus is in focus, I’d like to hold down semicolon (;) and type a sequence of numbers to apply tags. For example:
	•	Hold semicolon + 123 → Applies Priority Tag 1, Impact Tag 2, and Low Tag 3.
	•	Hold semicolon + 42 → Applies Priority Tag 4 and Impact Tag 2, ignoring Low Tags.

When I release the semicolon key, the sequence should trigger a Keyboard Maestro macro that applies the selected tags in OmniFocus.

My Question: Is this something Karabiner can handle? If not, would another tool work better for mapping key sequences like this?

Thanks in advance for your input!

Let me know if this works or if you’d like further adjustments!"

I want to create something a little larger than myself soon, and I am wondering what words to include. I've created a kind of prototype here, of a book I've been thinking about for years now, to give a vague idea of what I'd like to make yet again but in a better way.

In this, I am curious! I'm asking anyone reading, if they might like to contribute some text to the next few pages of this project. There's no profit, it's purely for prophet - and, I hope it might be kind of fun too, in some way. This is page one of.. what could potentially be a full book. I wonder what greater meaning could be added, or if maybe simple poetry is enough.

I guess I might just be looking for something to do with others, and I think I might not be the only one, so I figured I'd put something else out here. The most fun I've had with art have been, in some way, collaborations.

I've been here a long time but I've been kind of quiet, posting without interacting, and I'd like to change that. Let's play some weird art games?  I'm planning to build a custom visual around whatever writing ends up fitting onto a single spread like this - so.. if you think this style doesn't fit your writing, I already have plans to try and adapt to whatever ends up being contributed.

I'll also be recording the creation process, if you'd like to see how everything contributed ends up being integrated for yourself. I like this community and would like to try and be an actual part of it.

Strangers welcome, lurkers too, familiar faces as well.

 25YO, disaffected, uncredentialed DGGá™ making his case to work for Omni-Liberal Studios.

## Preface:

 The content here is entirely my own. ChatGPT helped me format an easier read for y’all. 

## ME

When people talk about incels or disaffected young men who have fallen behind in society, they’re talking about me. I’m posting today because, despite the controversy, I see an opportunity. But first, let me share my story or rather, the lack of one.

My parents and I are immigrants, though I landed in Canada just before my first birthday, so I’ve spent my whole life here

We started in government housing, but by the time I was 11, my parents had worked hard enough to move us into the middle class.

Despite this, I struggled. I wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD until I was around 19 or 20, so my school experiences were a constant battle with poor grades, missed homework, and spotty attendance. Despite all of this, I graduated high school—just barely—by being ‘on pace’ with credits but failing many classes, leaving me without a diploma.

I picked up a job at 7/11 and enrolled in an upgrading program, where I retook high school courses. For the first time, I passed math with a 90%, thanks to an amazing teacher.

Whilst I signed up for more classes, she came across me and asked why I was retaking English, as I was an A+ student in her class (and literally nothing else). After talking for a bit, she suggested I might have ADHD. I had never considered it before, but her insight led me to get diagnosed, which changed my life.

Without going into too much detail, succeeding in my upgrading courses gave me a confidence I hadn’t known before. For the first time, I felt I wasn’t the “dumb kid.” I even almost cried on the bus home after talking to a counsellor about my plans for university because unlike times past, I wasn’t bullshitting, I knew I could do it. But as it goes, good things don’t last forever.

COVID hit, and classes were abruptly canceled. We were given credits for what we’d done so far, despite not completing much. The program was free until I turned 21, and since it worked better with my learning style than a traditional university upgrade program, I stuck with it.

However, I didn’t have the necessary classes to apply for political science bachelor’s program, so I decided to keep working until things returned to normal. But then I got laid off from 7/11, and the store shut down, relocating me to a location I couldn’t reach to.
  
Even then, I wasn’t discouraged. I’d had a year and a half of good days—school, work, new hobbies, all felt like a manic high. I’d making beats for fun, and then got sucked into an MLM by a friend. I was introduced to Forex, basically no different from crypto or amway, and lost $2,000 before realizing I’d been duped. Still, that wasn’t enough to stop me.

At the same time, I was one of the first to join Dr. K’s coaching program for a 1-on-1 and group sessions, which helped keep my spirits up & genuinely helped me mature. After months of making beats, I uploaded one to YouTube, and to my surprise, I got $25 on the first day. The beat wasn’t great, but I had made money. It felt like a validation that I wasn’t the “dumb kid” anymore. I’m always going make something of myself.

But after a year, COVID restrictions lifted, and though I had some growth in music, I was still barely scraping by. I wasnâ€™t even making $200 a month from my beats. Many of them were stolen or used without my permission, and the reality of the business hit hard.

It was at this point I knew it was time to go back to school. I’d been living with my parents but I was without a job and now had to pay the upgrade fees, I was also 22 and starting to feel the pressure of falling behind. I’d also stopped receiving coaching after running out of saving to pay for it. And it was at this point. Things turned for the absolute worst 

My decisions to quit beats was so hard because of how much effort I put into it and how proud I was to share to everybody in my life and all social media that this is who I was. I was an up and coming music producer. It was at this point I decided I’m gonna stop telling people what I’m up too so there not so dissapointed, it was at this point I decided to delete all my social media, and stop talking to all my friends.

My best friends since grade school have tried to check up on me over the years, I’ve changed my phone number multiple times, they’ve came by my house for my birthday when I haven’t even acknowledged there’s. And when I last met them, my best friend was in tears worried about me asking me to just at least keep in touch because he’s worried about me. I said I would, but when he called, I was too ashamed of having nothing to talk to him about that I just didn’t pick up the phone 

How was I gonna solve this problem of being a nobody at 22? Well EDX offers courses for free in computer programming. So instead of getting a degree, I was gonna zuck it. I had an idea for streamlining the licensing process of digital media and digital rights disputes so I decided I’ll learn to build the website myself

I worked at UPS in order to try and make some money on the side but just didn’t have the energy working every day to do both the website and ups. So I quit ups to try and learn full time

Six months later, I gave up. I couldn’t build the site on my own, and the failure crushed me. I decided to find a real job, but struggled. Then I found a program that paid young adults to learn about the workforce in a classroom environment. I applied, and during my interview, I shared my story—how burnt out I was and needed help. The instructor told me I was exactly the type of person the program was for.


Long story short, I got a job at a toy store, and more importantly, I got my confidence back. But at 25, I still had no income, no qualifications, and a resume that made it look like I’d done nothing for but gooned the past almost decade.


I don’t talk to my best friends anymore, and I haven’t spoken to my coaches in years. The only consistent support I’ve had for the past decade is you, Destiny, and your community.

On October 14, 2023, I made this post (pre-DGG callout for never unironically glazing). I kept it short because I didn’t want to belabor how much your work has meant to me.

Today, I’m sharing the full story because I want to help.

You’ve consistently proven to be the most effective force in modern media, especially when confronting conservative alt-media hacks. My story may statistically align with the type of men who voted for Trump, but I know he was never the answer. I want to help others see that as well.

If you’re considering giving my sob story a shot for an interview, here’s what I believe I can bring to the table:

### Unique Perspectives: 

I can provide insights on self-improvement, engagement with online communities, and advocacy for men in my demographic who are grappling with the same challenges I’ve faced.

### Public Advocacy: 
Supporting candidates shouldn’t only apply to presidential campaigns. It should’t just be you going on Fresh & Fit or TYT to advocate for yourself. I want to be an advocate for you and the ideas we’ve built here.

Splitting the Load: You’ve often said, “I can’t trust that until I’ve read it myself,” and you’re right to maintain that standard. But I’d love to help do the heavy lifting whether it’s diving deep into topics there isn’t time to cover (eg. mueller), researching nuanced takes, or organizing pointed, specific research that’s useful for you and the community.

Whatever happens, I want you to know I’m here to help. If that means sticking with my current job, paying my way through school, and hitting you up in five years, then so be it. You’ve been there for me when I needed it the most, and I want to be here for you now.

Can't decide between X1E-78 and X1E-80 laptop for software development,snapdragon,1i9ov2p,2025-01-25 10:07:00,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/snapdragon/comments/1i9ov2p/cant_decide_between_x1e78_and_x1e80_laptop_for/,TheSpixxyQ,,"Hi! I'm currently looking for a new laptop. I've decided to try Snapdragon (I also have a desktop, so it won't be my main machine), but I can't decide on which model to get. My hard requirement is 32 GB RAM and max price around $2k.

In Czechia the only available X1E-80 with 32 GB RAM I could find is DELL Latitude 7455 (the XPS 13 is not available here for some reason).

X1E-78 has more options here like Lenovo Yoga Slim 7, HP OmniBook X14 and Asus ZenBook A14.

I mean both 78 and 80 will be **much** better than my current old i5 8265U and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't make a mistake by getting either of them. But since all the listed models cost around the same here, which one would you get?

I already asked the question on the FF7Remake's subreddit but I'll ask here too.

Where and when do you think Aerith will be present in part 3´ s story ?

For me, the only possibilities I can think of are :

•	⁠In some other timeline cutscene where she was saved by Cloud, like what they did with Zack
•	⁠At the northern crater as a Jenova illusion to mess up with Cloud to give ""her"" the black materia
•	⁠During the lifestream sequence guiding / protecting Tifa to help Cloud (Omni Aerith)
•	⁠In the forgotten city when they find out what happened with the white materia (the one Cloud saved could be there or it'll be just flashes of the past like the OG)
•	⁠There is a scene with Omni Aerith / Saved Aerith before the final battle instead of the Highwind scene with Tifa, depending on affection points
•	⁠Omni Aerith fights Sephiroth alongside Cloud and Zack in the final battle, they then both disappear.

Edit : Well looks like Aerith survived after all : https://x.com/Ayaka33516424/status/1883036971670573264"

(https://exvius.fandom.com/wiki/Tegmine/JP)

Now, I would like to add, this guide encompasses all the permanent missions related to this trial that will allow you to promote Teg to EX3. And, for the first time in my guides - I get to directly mention *Sinzar*! 😇

Also, thank *Kojimaru* as always, for the permanent mission clears as well. Let's begin!

To locate the fight, after you reach the Hidden Chamber, run to the bottom right section of the map and you will find the pedestal to Tegmine's crystal.

**Wiki** - https://exvius.fandom.com/wiki/Hidden_Chamber_of_Arms_-_Betrayal_of_an_Envious_Schemer/JP

**Boss info/race**

*Tochalouse the Envious/Human, Beast* - Oh boy, this guy.... He has 2 phases. **Phase 1** - This guy, not only he has Physical accuracy boosted on his attacks, he will drain your MP and attack you with hybrid attacks. On top of that, he has this Trap mechanic build in him, which means if you attack him with any element, he will imbue your party with that element, boost his elemental resistance to that element and reduce your element resist and this will keep increasing in value if you keep attacking him with the same element on increasing turns, making it harder for you to burst this guy down. He will keep warning you until 16 turns that something big is about to happen and then, he will attack your whole party will an omni-element attack and reset this turn count. Oh, he can also inflict you with status ailments, so keep this in mind also. **Phase 2** - at 50% HP, he will shift to his next and final phase. He will open with 2x physical attacks on your provoker with accuracy boosted, then 2x AoE, Petrify AoE, Fixed attack AoE and Berserk. Goddamn! That's a lot! On next turns, he will eject your provoker for 2 turns, he will buff his physical offense and defense stats which you can't remove. He will inflict death and status ailments and just like phase 1, he will deal hybrid, fixed and physical attacks on your party with accuracy boosted.

**Mission - clear the battle, clear in 25/18/12 Turns (win 200 Tegmine shards, Tegmine unit and 400 Lapis)**

**Sinzar's video** - https://youtu.be/wIr4xUnaxU4

**Notes** - uh, rather than me explaining anything, just watch the video. He has done a pretty damn good job explaining this clear.

**Mission - clear with Harbingers of Chaos category Team (win 50 Tegmine shards)**

**Koji's video** - https://youtu.be/Qh2l_rKINps

**His Team** - Gabranth (Neo Vision), Dioxus (leader), Cloud of Darkness (True SBB unit) x2, Chorale and Ihana

**Notes**

1. Gab - HP and defense bulk. Provoke 100%. Give him at least 2 Lakshmi Synergy. Physical tanking, provoker, mitigation provider. He has EX Bonus as omnicover as well.
2. Dio - Build for damage. 1 source of Guts in the shift form. There for LS and Dark damage. (Ashal, Onyx Sephiroth or Ardyn will fare better here) 
3. CoD - build for damage. Has Dark area fields, dark debuffs, constant dark damage through LB.
4. Chorale - LB gauge fill equipment and 1 source of Guts. 1 source of Ribbon. Stat Debuffer and big Dark imperil.
5. Ihana - 1 source of MP reduce for skills, Dispel spell on materia, bulk and 1 source of MP Healing if you can fit it. Human killer buffer. Offensive stat and LB damage buffer.
6. Friend - same as own CoD.
7. Your goal with this team is to down the boss HP to 50% in first 3 turns.
8. If you want to swap any other unit in your team to fulfill a role, make sure they belong to the Harbingers of Chaos category.
9. If you have Tegmine already, you can slot him in Ihana's place as he provides Beast and Human killer buff for the party. This config will allow you to clear the ""clear with Tegmine"" mission. (but not the Chaos one)

**Mission - clear with The Gathering category Team (win 50 Tegmine shards)**

**Koji's video** - https://youtu.be/R3onsBEI51U

**His Team** - Ihana, Dark Roca (leader), Vanharma x2, King of Bal Galuf and Knights of Pluto Captain Steiner

**Notes**

1. Gear everyone in party except Vanharma with a Death Immunity source.
2. It is better if you enhance your units with pots to ensure more damage and durability. If your units are dying often in the battle, maybe door pot them (or replace them with newer units that can fulfill the mentioned role)
3. Ihana - 1 source of MP reduce for skill. HP and defense bulk. 100% Provoke. 2 sources of Guts. Dual wielding and has a source of Attack +1. Offensive stat and LB damage buffer. Has human killer buffs also. Normal attack can heal MP (very crucial since the boss loves to drain party's MP) and provide 2x AoE mirage (this is great because even if boss Berserk her, she can be useful to the party).
4. Roca - build for damage. Has 2 sources of Guts. Also has ability that fills party's HP and MP over time. Can also AoE Earth imbue (Ihana also can do this) and Quick to shorten CD on Vanharma mainly. Can also LB Fill the party through Haste.
5. Vanharma - build for damage. Has Dispel Force and Bahamut Synergy. Make sure he has unlocked his latent abilities from the Sealed Tower mission clears.
6. Steiner - HP and defense bulk. Geared same way in both base and shift forms. Give him maybe 2-3 sources of MP reduce for skill and 1 MP Healing source. Also, Ribbon effect and Lakshmi Synergy. Physical tank, mitigations through LB, debuffer. 
7. Galuf - don't worry about his EX levels. Just gear him with HP and Defense bulk (maybe 1 source of MP reduce for skills also). Give him at least one Breaker materia (Edge, President Raegan, Return Akstar, Tulien TMR). Main debuffer (on the defensive side at side). Also, chain support with Roca.
8. Friend - almost the same equipment and all abilities as own Van.
9. If you want to swap any other unit in your team to fulfill a role, make sure they belong to The Gathering category.
10. The idea with this party to stall the first phase as much as possible and slowly chip away the boss's HP and then 1 Hit KO (or maybe 2 if you can't hack it) the boss in 2nd phase. Of course, you can change this course by bursting the boss in first phase by 2/3 turns if you have newer units (like Raegan or Akstar of Ultimate Summon fame or maybe Hyoh and Panthera Ultimus).

**Mission - clear with Tegmine in your team (win 50 Tegmine shards)**

**Koji's video** - https://youtu.be/td-vyPPvaCI

**His Team** - Denial of Focus Vanille, Runda, The Undying (True SBB unit) x2, Tegmine and Flaring Aether Rain (leader)

**Notes**
1. Have everyone (except Vanille) in your party equipped with a source of Death Immunity.
2. If possible, stick all units in your party with a ribbon effect source. If not, don't worry about it.
3. Vanille - 100% Provoke. Have 1 source of MP reduce for skills. Set on Phoenix with Fira (for chaining) and Self reraise ability learned. Don't worry about death Immunity on her as we need her to die and reraise so that the effects of Berserk from the boss don't stick on her. Debuffer, area imperil on boss and AoE cure. 
4. Runda - 100% Provoke (we need him on the lower spot than Vanille since she's our priority Provoker. You know, the provoke priority mechanic). Have him set on Lakshmi. Have Ribbon effect, Lakshmi Synergy on him as well to counter status ailment heals. Bahamut Synergy also for the evocation gauge fill and Lehftia (normal version) TMR for Fire BS ability chaining support. You can heal the party with Runda with the help of Lakshmi summon. Physical Tank, mitigations and LB filler.
5. Undying - Build for damage. Boost his MP as much as possible so you can use his MP burst ability (Global players, remember this one?). 
6. Teg - just ribbon effect, MP Healing, MP reduce for skill sources. Has perfect dispel and ST ally debuff clear ability. Also has Human and Beast killer buff ability like I mentioned in the Chaos section.
7. Rain - build the same way in both base and shift form for damage boost. Has Fire imbue and has AoE Fire amp buff. Great for himself and Undyings. 
8. Friend - same equipment as own Undying. 
9.  If you want to swap any other unit in your team to fulfill a role..... Eh, choose whoever you want. Just make sure Tegmine **STAYS** in your party somewhere. And like I mentioned in the Chaos section, you can use that team also.
10.  In phase 2, you might notice in the video that the boss petrified both Undying (and them healing it because their SLB went off). You can't heal this with LS because boss doesn't attack Runda. If that happens, use Vanille's Esuna spell to cure it."

SKU Checks,employedbykohls,1i9glwt,2025-01-25 01:04:17,12,0.87,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/employedbykohls/comments/1i9glwt/sku_checks/,HopedSugar89569,Informative,"Before I start sorry if this is repetitive at all but I thought I’d share. 

If you’re looking for a SKU and Google Image takes you to an item that’s no longer in stock in any size/color. You can hold down on the kohls link, not the product picture and get the “PRD” aka Product Code that will help you. Then you can write that number down and take it to a computer in the back…Zebras used to have this capability but they took it away, surprise surprise…and then go to MyKohls and Omni Services, Controls and Reporting (OSCR), it’s something like that. Then do an inventory search with the “WebID” and that’s where you’ll input the “PRD” code you got from online earlier and it should give you SKU numbers for every size and color. 

Also, another way I’ve had good luck is actually doing a general Vendor search in Mainframe. If you know enough about the basics of an item it can be pretty simple to search through there whether it be by color, style, dept, however you see fits best and in some selections you can put unknown or unspecified, whichever it was I forgot, and it gives you a few hundred UPCs yes but it’s pretty easy to narrow down once you get the hang of it and notice it’s just a long list cause it has all the sizes and colors so not that many UPCs to look through. 

Just thought this would help, had a great mentor teach me everything I know so thought I could share her wisdom! Happy researching!"

Can anyone comment as to what this process actually is? I assume the COE is to certify that I'm eligible to purchase ammo and the FFL03 is to say I'm a collector?

I just have so many questions about this process. A few of them are:

* What are the requirements to get a COE? Simply having purchased a firearm in California and nothing else?
* What does the COE process look like broken down? Do I have to do things in a particular order? It sounds like LiveScan is first, but what do I do after I complete it?
* What are the requirements for the FFL03? Can anyone become a collector? After I have it I just walk into any Sheriff's station with a copy in an envelope and leave it there?

Any guidance would be appreciated as it seems that this is the grail to cheaper ammo.

Lastly, if I end up being too lazy to do all of the above things, what is the cheapest place in LA/OC to get bulk ammo? Either in 500 or 1000 round batches is what I'm looking for.

UPDATE: Omni-8888 linked a YouTube video below. Watch that. Also, in the video, note that he fills out the forms twice. If you do exactly what the video says at the beginning and Google the form, there is a new form which automatically updates the information on the CLEO's copy, so no need to fill it out twice. Also, note that there are comments in the video that say the DOJ is declining COE applications that do not have the FFL03 number. Get that first, then proceed to the COE application. Takes longer, but it seems to work.  Based on common sense, I do not recommend pushing back, as the video description states."
"What does Hegel (and Spinoza) mean by ""every determination is negation""? And another Hegel question.",askphilosophy,1i9fo82,2025-01-25 00:05:32,8,0.9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1i9fo82/what_does_hegel_and_spinoza_mean_by_every/,Boomdigity102,,"I'm currently reading Being and Nothingness by Sartre. I'm really not familiar with Hegel, but Sartre seems to be critiquing Hegel's conception of non-being.

Sartre mentions  Hegel's use of a phrase by Spinoza:

>""What enables Hegel to make being ""pass over into"" nothingness is his implicitly introducing negation into his very definition of being. This goes without saying, since a definition is negative, and since Hegel has told us - by taking up an expression from Spinoza- that *omnis determinatio est negatio*.""

The footnote on the Latin phrase translates it as ""every determination is negation.""

My question on this specifically, is what does it mean as Spinoza used it? Is this getting at the idea that defining something is negating the things that it is not?

My second question is from the proceeding line, where Sartre quotes Hegel's *Science of Logic:*

>""And doesn't he say: 'if any . . . content were posited in \[being\] as distinct, or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, it would therefore fail to hold fast to its purity. It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness. There is *nothing* to be intuited in it . . .?'""

My question on this is, what is Hegel getting at here? I don't understand ""it would therefore fail to hold fast to its purity."" what purity is Hegel referring to here? And further, what about this makes Sartre disagree with Hegel?"

Kars (JJBA) VS Omni-man (Invincible) who would win?,whowouldwin,1i9er24,2025-01-24 23:11:01,1,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1i9er24/kars_jjba_vs_omniman_invincible_who_would_win/,AnalysisOdd8487,Battle,"Round 1: 

Kars is his basic self, no Ultimate Life form, he can however summon the other 2 Pillarmen whenever he wishes, but if they die, they die permanently.   
Omni man is just.. omniman after he kills the guardians of the globe, but before his fight with his son.

Location is in the coliseum where Joesph and kars fought (Joesph is not present but the german army is.)

Round 2: same location, Kars has used the Aja mask and has become the ultimate life form and can no longer summon the Pillermen, And we'll just say that Omniman becomes furious because kars killed his son or something. 

Who would win?"

But what about actual game mechanics. Omni-directional rolling has to happen. Moving while flasking. And can we please have 4 ring slots.

In terms of setting. Just adjust the last 15% of the game. Lost Izalith especially. "

Selling my practically new Vortex scopes.  Both come with boxes, paperwork, and mounted.  I will consider parting scopes and mounts if they don't sell together - if so I will relist so please no dibs on mounts or scopes only.

~~**Vortex Razor HD Gen II-E 1-6x24** **VMR-2 (MRAD)** on a **Badger COMM 1.7"" Mount** \- purchased the scope about a month ago, the mount is a C&R from here.  Scope was mounted and zeroed (\~10 rounds) and has sat in my safe since.  Glass is perfect, body is perfect, comes with everything you'd get in the box.  Looking for $1200 shipped + insured.~~

**Vortex Venom 3-15x44 EBR-7C (MOA)** on a **Vortex Pro Extended Mount** \- Same story, perfect condition and comes with everything in the box.  Great scope but don't have a place to shoot past 100 yards so it just sits in my safe.  Asking $350 shipped + insured.

Will accept Paypal FF & Venom.  Dibs takes it,  Lowball offers will be flat-out ignored.  I'll ship out same or next day.

  
Will consider trade value for

* Vudu 1-6
* Older (no delam) XPS2
* Fast OMNI mount for G45"
(Maybe) hot take: I prefer Conan as a DLC character to Homelander and Omni-Man,MortalKombat,1i9egwc,2025-01-24 22:55:13,279,0.92,82,https://i.redd.it/cp2xmdi5c2fe1.jpeg,EddtheMetalHead,Misc,"Apologies for the long post, but I felt the need to get this out there.

I know people are upset about Conan being added to MK1, for one reason or another. I haven’t played him yet, so idk if he’s actually good, but I like the idea of him being a fighter than Omni-Man, Peacemaker or Homelander. The addition of those (imo overrated) characters felt like an obvious cash-in on the popularity of their respective shows. Conan, on the other hand, isn’t exactly relevant anymore, so his addition feels less forced and more like some people actually sat down, thought of a character to add and decided on an iconic badass from the 80s.

TL;DR: Actual gameplay aside, I actually prefer Conan to Omni-Man, Homelander and Peacemaker because he doesn’t feel like a cash grab."

A core tenanent of the faith is one must follow their own journey accepting it into their lives through various traditions and rituals. It’s a bit like Christianity but kinda also like Judaism in so many ways. I liked it a lot because it was importantly monotheistic like the religions most popular in this country as defined by many arguments and legal protections made in favor of. 


Anyone know the name of this religion? I feel like it would be really appealing to trans people given how much importance it places on civil liberties and such I wanna join so I can make sure any talk of banning hormones that have been used as a way of religious expression as defended by such in the supreme courts 1993 ruining "
