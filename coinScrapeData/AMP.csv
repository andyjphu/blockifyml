Help a Gretsch newbie out!,gretsch,1i9xdcq,2025-01-25 16:20:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gretsch/comments/1i9xdcq/help_a_gretsch_newbie_out/,tpatenaude1,,"Hello everyone,

Recently, I bought myself a G5622T with a Fender BassBreaker amp. I had been playing acoustic for several years, and wanted to delve in the world of electric guitars.

Before buying the Gretsch, I did some research, because I didn't know (and still don't really know) anything about electric guitars. I really enjoy jazz (like Julie London-esque style), RnB and also rock, although not extremely hardcore rock. Looking at reviews and other reddit posts, I read that semi-hollow guitars provide that versatility, meaning you can pretty much play them for anything and they'll sound good.

That being said, I'm having a hard time with the pickups and different settings. If I want to play smoother jazz, which pickup should I use? And what about rock? Rockabilly?

Thanks for reading, have a nice day!"

After many many years I am getting back into my vinyl collection, and after about a year of using my Fluance turn table into a Klipsch The Three (with disappointing results) I am resurrecting my old family receiver, a Yamaha CR 600.

I really don't know much about vintage gear (or new gear for that matter...).  My understanding is that people suggest speakers with 8 OHMs for amps of this era, but other than that I'm a bit lost.

Do people have recommendations for speakers that would pair will with this receiver?  I am open to vintage or new, thinking of a budget of around $300 (but ideally less).  My living room is 12x20, but the space is open concept.  I listen to jazz, classic rock and singer/songwriter/folk mostly.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.  Cheers!"

So I recently purchased a THX Onyx because of the fact that it is one of the few usb dac/amps that allow mic input through the 3.5mm jack. The reason I chose it is because I only have a small ROG Ally portable PC and Victus Gaming Laptop. My space is very limited in my gaming setup, so it is preferable for me to simply use the mic on my IEM cables and 3rd Party cables for my headphones.

When I connect my cables to my Ally or Laptop jacks directly, the volume on the mic is more than adequate. Everything sounds very clear.

When I connect the Onyx, both computers recognize it perfectly for both output and input. The problem is that when I test the microphone, the volume is extremely low. I have to talk VERY loudly in order for the microphone to pickup any audio.

I tried every troubleshooting there is online. The settings on windows have the mic at 100%. I tried control panel options (unfortunately there is no gain boost option). I even tried Equalizer APO and set the gain up as much as possible and there was no change to the volume of the mic. (I also checked all the troubleshooting on APO about enhancements.)

Does anyone have any idea of what could be the problem? If not I might just have to give up and purchase a separate usb mic from amazon to see if there is any improvement in comparison to the mic on the Onyx.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

In-Depth Analysis of the Stella &amp; Dot 2025 MLM Business Model

The Stella &amp; Dot 2025 MLM business model offers an intriguing opportunity for individuals looking to break into the world of direct sales and multi-level marketing. This innovative model combines fashion with an engaging social experience, attracting those who are passionate about jewelry and accessories. To truly understand this business model, it's essential to analyze its structure, benefits, challenges, and overall effectiveness in 2025.

### Understanding the MLM Structure

In a multi-level marketing (MLM) framework, individuals do not only earn money from selling products, but also from recruiting others into the business. Here‚Äôs how the structure generally works:

- **Direct Sales:** Representatives, known as Stylists, sell Stella &amp; Dot's jewelry and accessories directly to customers through parties, social media, and personal networks.
- **Recruitment:** Stylists can recruit other Stylists. When these recruits make sales, the original Stylist earns a percentage of that commission.
- **Commission Structure:** Each Stylist receives a predetermined commission based on their sales volume, with potential for additional bonuses based on their team‚Äôs performance.

### Benefits of Joining Stella &amp; Dot

- **Income Variability:** Income can highly fluctuate based on sales and recruitment success. Not all Stylists earn substantial profits, which can lead to disappointment.
- **Time Investment:** Building a successful business requires significant commitment and effort, and results may not be immediate.

### Evaluating the Potential Earnings

Understanding potential earnings is crucial in assessing the Stella &amp; Dot business model. Earnings can vary widely based on individual effort and market dynamics. Here are some key factors that influence income:

- **Sales Performance:** Stylists earn a percentage off their direct sales, so higher individual sales result in better earnings.

- **Promotions and Bonuses:** Various incentives can boost earnings, such as bonuses for hitting specific milestones.

### Customer Experience and Brand Loyalty

The Stella &amp; Dot brand emphasizes a unique shopping experience, which significantly enhances customer loyalty. The emphasis on quality, design, and the community aspect helps retain customers. Customers are encouraged to participate in events, enabling them to experience products firsthand while building relationships with Stylists.

Moreover, stylish, on-trend offerings ensure that customers feel they‚Äôre making a fashionable choice. This commitment to customer satisfaction further supports Stylists by fostering repeat business and referrals.

The decision to join Stella &amp; Dot as a Stylist in 2025 can be rewarding for motivated individuals. With the right mix of enthusiasm, commitment, and strategic organization, it offers an excellent balance of product quality and social engagement.

Common Misconceptions About the MLM Structure of Stella &amp; Dot
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Many people are drawn to the direct selling world of Stella &amp; Dot, captivated by the opportunity it presents for entrepreneurship and financial independence. However, there are several common misconceptions about the multi-level marketing (MLM) structure that surrounds this company. Understanding these misconceptions can help you navigate the landscape more effectively and make informed decisions about engaging with Stella &amp; Dot.

### The Myth of Guaranteed Income

One prevalent misconception is that joining Stella &amp; Dot guarantees a steady income. It's essential to recognize that earnings in an MLM structure depend significantly on individual effort, sales skills, and team building. Just because you sign up doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll start earning a paycheck immediately. Many factors play a role in your financial success, such as:

- Your sales capabilities
- Your ability to recruit others
- The demand for the products in your area
- Your networking skills

Like any business venture, the level of income you can achieve is proportional to the amount of effort you invest.

### High Startup Costs

Some potential recruits hesitate to join Stella &amp; Dot because they fear high upfront costs. While it is true that there is an initial investment to become a Stylist, many find it to be reasonable compared to starting a traditional business. Your investment typically includes a starter kit with jewelry and accessories, training materials, and marketing tools. Also, the beauty of MLM is that you can sell to friends and family to recoup your cost quickly, leveraging your social circle for initial sales.

### Misunderstanding Commissions and Bonuses

Many individuals wrongly believe that earning commissions in Stella &amp; Dot is complicated. In reality, the compensation structure is straightforward once understood. You earn a percentage of your personal sales, and as your team grows, you can receive additional bonuses from their sales. This tiered reward system truly incentivizes Stylists to work both independently and collaboratively:

- Personal sales: You keep a percentage based on your total sales.
- Team commissions: You earn from your recruits‚Äô sales.
- Performance bonuses: Extra incentives for achieving specific sales goals.

Taking time to analyze the compensation plan can empower you with the knowledge to maximize your earnings potential.

### Skepticism Toward Product Quality

A common misconception about Stella &amp; Dot is that the quality of its products might be subpar. This concern often arises when individuals compare it to traditional retail brands. However, Stella &amp; Dot prides itself on offering high-quality, trendy jewelry and accessories. The company continuously invests in design and customer feedback, ensuring that the products resonate with current fashion trends while maintaining durability.

### The Reluctance to Network

Some people fear that multi-level marketing involves pushing products onto friends and family, creating uncomfortable dynamics. This misconception can deter potential Stylists from joining. However, Stella &amp; Dot emphasizes building authentic relationships rather than just selling. The focus is on connecting with people and sharing products that you truly love. Here are some healthy networking tips:

- Create genuine connections with potential customers.
- Host fun and engaging trunk shows to showcase products.
- Leverage social media to share your passion for the products.

You can foster a positive experience without compromising your personal relationships.

### Time Commitment Misunderstandings

Many individuals assume joining Stella &amp; Dot requires a significant time commitment, limiting their ability to participate. However, one of the key benefits of MLM is the flexibility it offers. Stylists can tailor their schedules based on their lifestyles. Whether you want to make it a part-time gig or a full-time endeavor, Stella &amp; Dot allows you to determine your level of commitment. You can work at your pace and adjust as needed based on personal demands and goals.

Understanding these common misconceptions surrounding the MLM structure of Stella &amp; Dot is crucial for anyone considering joining.

If i connect the drv8825 vmotor to my power supply at 12v it works like a charm, so im pretty sure the problem is the mt3608 boost converter.

Currently (Jan 2025) travel trailer is in mint condition and pickup is excellent but in 20K miles could require service per what dealership suggested. After it was with dealer for recall work the check engine light did go on but that is likely the 65K miles service to resolve, approx $2,200.

Monthly:

$1,300 autoloan

$405 travel trailer

$300 insurance

Approximate $75 ish to fill fuel tank and then $22 every 3 fills for DEF (diesel exhaust fluid).

Ideally an established business in any of the states below or others OK too:

Colorado  
Wyoming  
Nebraska  
South Dakota  
New Mexico

I have three 200 Watt 12v solar panels I plan to wire in parallel.

For each panel:

VOC=21.8

ISC=11.6

After doing some calculations, I figured I'd need 8 AWG wire connected to branch connectors then to a 40 Amp breaker.

The solar panels come with cables with connectors that fit the branch connector - these cables are 12

AWG.

My question is, will the 12 AWG cables be too small for the combined power? Should I remove the cable connected to the solar panel and exchange for 8 AWG for EACH panel?

Ideally, I can keep the OEM cable, connect them to the cable connector then 8 AWG wire that goes to my breaker, and not have to buy another bundle of wire.

Thanks for any help! "

Nearest amp tech is 150 mi away. 

I'm handy and replaced a screen resistor for one of the power tubes a few years ago. With advice the the man himself (Dave). And it has been rocking ever since.  

Lately it has been overdriving the clean channel. Checked the tubes and V3 the cathode follower was bad. 12ax7. I replaced it and it blew again. Worked normal for less than 5 min then failed. Thinking it may have been a bad tube I tried another and it failed. I use an Orange tube tester. 

What are the chances of two duds in a row.(JJs). I didn't want to try a 3rd before I do some deeper diagnostics. 

Any suggestions for things to check for a diagnostics for a failed cathode  follower?

Thanks

(I'm not afraid to get under the hood. Built a couple dozen pedals, built a fender 6g15 clone, worked on a few other amps. Recapped my dads '72 pro reverb. Have a Princeton kit on the docket... But still consider myself a noob. And would rather fix it myself then ship it out. )"

Any ideas on resolution for this? Seems like building a farraday cage over the amp is the only solution, a friend who has similar issues in the city did something similar and reduced the noise a lot. "

This verse is a powerful reminder that transformation is part of our spiritual journey. Being in Christ implies a continual renewal, where the old fades away, and we embrace new beginnings. This process doesn‚Äôt happen overnight; it unfolds one day at a time.

Consider how subtle shifts in perception can initiate profound change. Each small decision to live more intentionally is like planting a seed of transformation. Over time, these seeds grow, blooming into a radiant testimony of God‚Äôs continual work within us.

Let the act of embracing change be a spiritual practice, where each new habit leads you closer to the heart of Christ. There, you‚Äôll find the strength and inspiration to become a new creation every single day.

I've had the skills all along to carry me easily through beginning lessons, and I'm now midway through intermediate, and I'm just now starting to feel really pushed. I used to sit there and noodle, and it would just all sound so random, I'd tell myself I suck, get frustrated and put it down, and pick the guitar back up and repeat. 

What rocksmith has done for me is show me how to put all of my skills i already knew together so it sounds like cohesive music. I've only been at it for 3-4 weeks, and I've become a much better player in pretty rapid order. Helps that I already had a foundation, but I can say for the first time whether I'm playing rocksmith or just playing on my amp, playing my guitar(s) doesn't feel like a chore, it's a freaking blast.

Battery not holding charge,nissanxtrail,1i9wdc8,2025-01-25 15:36:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nissanxtrail/comments/1i9wdc8/battery_not_holding_charge/,Longjumping_Jaguar34,,"Hi

Can someone please help. I got a 65 plate Nissan x trail (t32) and since  around 7th Jan iv needed to jump start my car nearly every single day in the mornings (once started it would start fine rest of the day until the following morning)

I don't do long journeys max 15mins each way and weather has been some what cold. Could this be the reason?

I had rac come today and they did a battery test they said its healthy just needs changing.  He also time an amp test and 15mins after engine had been off it was reading as 0.7. Is this to high? There were no lights on or anything that we could see that could be causing battery to drain. Rac said my alternator is fine too. My stop/start light also comes on too.

I've just taken it on the motorway for an hour. I'm hoping this would fix it. My neighbour did a battery test on weds and it showed as 60%.

Has anyone else had similar issue. I don't mind buying a new battery but if it's underlying issue I rather resolve that first otherwise il have issue with new battery too.

Kiwi Ears Nailed It At Their First Try! The Kiwi Ears Division,headphones,1i9wah4,2025-01-25 15:32:54,0,0.4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1i9wah4/kiwi_ears_nailed_it_at_their_first_try_the_kiwi/,GreenUserper,Review,"# Review Of The Kiwi Ears Division



https://preview.redd.it/e64zf4dq87fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=871cb28e1bed6fa79adc4fadaf409fa097c5b470



**Introduction**



https://preview.redd.it/784f276397fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb4fa57db3191a0995916ed2bb2187341612124

I‚Äôve been eagerly waiting for the arrival of headphones from various companies, but I never imagined Kiwi Ears would enter this market so swiftly. Kiwi Ears is a well-known Chinese electroacoustic company that has been producing audiophile-favorite in-ear monitors, affordable DAC/AMPs, and now headphones. The company has been engaged in extensive research and development of their products, particularly their IEMs, and has released them without any breaks. Surprisingly, they have garnered a massive following among audiophiles, and I‚Äôm one of them. Regardless of their previous offerings, Kiwi Ears‚Äô entry into the headphone market is on a whole new level. Many companies have attempted and failed in their initial attempts to create headphones, and I fear the same for Kiwi Ears with their Division release. Fortunately, I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one to determine whether it‚Äôs a hit or a miss. However, before delving further, I‚Äôd like to clarify a few points.¬†



**Disclaimer**



\*Since this unit tour was organised by the kindly people at Kiwi Ears, I am grateful to them. As I've said in all of my evaluations, the same is true for this one: all of the concepts I've expressed below are entirely my own, original ideas that haven't been influenced by anyone else. If interested, go to this [link](https://kiwiears.com/products/kiwi-ears-division).¬†

\*I am not associated with the connection, and I receive no financial assistance from anyone.

\*For the remainder of the review, I will refer to these headphones as ‚ÄúDivision.‚Äù

\*I am using different ear-tips for convenience and better versatility.

\*Finally, I will only evaluate the Division based on its performance, even though I will explain how it feels and seems physically and aesthetically.

\*Please understand that all opinions expressed in this review are my personal perspective and are not intended to offend anyone‚Äôs beliefs or experiences. Therefore, I kindly request a respectful and thoughtful approach to this review, even if it differs from your viewpoint.

\*Apologies for the delayed review of these headphones. I eagerly awaited another excellent contender in this price range, the Takstar Pro 82, to arrive. Unfortunately, due to some complexities and workarounds, they never cleared customs in my country.¬†



**Specifications**



https://preview.redd.it/pfe0cxv497fe1.png?width=3910&format=png&auto=webp&s=6db199abe905bad5067f842734fc7eefb2944fa1

The Division headphones feature a closed-back design with a 40mm composite dynamic driver in each earcup. The plastic headband swivels to one side and folds inwards, making them convenient for storage. The earpads are generic and come with the headphones, similar to those found on budget-friendly headphones. The headband ends are marked with ‚ÄúL‚Äù and ‚ÄúR,‚Äù and the body of the earcups on the outside bear the Kiwi Ears logo on both sides. Accessories include a 1/4 inch adapter with two cables. Each cable has a single-ended 3.5mm jack, one for the headphones and the other for the source. One cable is long and extendable, while the other has a built-in microphone with a single button. Technically, the headphones have an impedance of 32 ohms and a sensitivity of 98dB. Their frequency response range spans from 20Hz to 20kHz.¬†



**Design & Build**



https://preview.redd.it/xv1bs9u597fe1.png?width=3783&format=png&auto=webp&s=90f924cc35965d9ed27368c5ce91defbdc4d92a5

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the design. It‚Äôs quite similar to the Audio Technica M50x, but it‚Äôs not as sturdy. I believe the Divisions have a good build and can last long, but I‚Äôm not sure what to expect from a $50 headphone. The plastic quality is generic, and durability isn‚Äôt its strong suit, but it proved me wrong, I believe.



As for the earpads, they‚Äôre also generic, but they‚Äôre cheap and can cover average-sized ears easily.



During my commutes and some rough handling while taking and keeping them in my backpack, I‚Äôm not confident, but I do think that these headphones are built well for the price. However, this is just my personal experience, and I still feel like they could break if I‚Äôm not careful.



The cables are similar to those that come with Bluetooth speakers, but they‚Äôre better made and molded specifically for headphones. The mic on the shorter cable is similar to the Koss KPH30i and works great too.



Overall, I find the design to be very casual and easy to use. The lightweight body makes them convenient and easy to handle, even though they look a bit flimsy. In my testing, they turned out to be sturdy.¬†



**Usage**



https://preview.redd.it/t69mxnz697fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=2621eabfe05032e5a789a744d32653a18c6c470a

Now, since I mentioned earlier that I used this headphone while commuting, I‚Äôd like to share that I also used them at home for critical listening. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect comfort from the earpads, and they weren‚Äôt very comfortable. On the other hand, the pressure on my head from the cups was perfect, and I was able to tolerate the pads for longer hours.



I must admit that I was a bit careless when using this outside. I would take them out of my backpack, put them inside, or rest them on my shoulder while the cable got tangled and stretched out. But I was amazed by how durable this headphone was.



Regarding using this with different sources, I genuinely never felt underpowered with any source, whether it was my LG G8X or my FiiO M15S. However, when I plugged them into my Aune X7S, a desktop Class-A amplifier, the drivers distorted while listening to music. The bass sounded bloated and too boomy, which I believe is a result of either overamplification or an incompatible source.



I should mention that these headphones have powerful bass that I personally didn‚Äôt find bleed into the mids. However, I spoke to people who own Division and complained that the bass is too boomy and overpowering. So, I tried different earpads, especially deep ones, and found that the bass was significantly improved and less prominent. This helped the midrange to sound a bit tamed and balanced the treble.



The passive noise cancellation was truly great. It effectively isolated me from the crowd and allowed me to focus on the music. However, it‚Äôs important to note that Division aren‚Äôt like noise-canceling headphones. The effectiveness of the noise cancellation depends on how well they seal around the head, and I believe they are effective for average-sized ears.



Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed using these headphones and encountered no issues. The only drawbacks were the discomfort of the earpads and the amplifier issue. I understand that readers may be concerned about sweat and warmth buildup inside the earcups, but since it‚Äôs winter, I can‚Äôt provide much information. I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôll perform in the summer. However, I believe these earpads are ideal for keeping the ears warm.¬†



**Sound**



https://preview.redd.it/exxw677897fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a816126a0243ec4543524e83188805db6d9a391

After thoroughly evaluating this headphones from various perspectives and criteria, I must say that I believe they are indeed DJ headphones and, to an extent, a great basshead audiophile headphone. They offer an enjoyable and exciting listening experience, especially considering their affordable price point of $50. However, I am slightly skeptical about their suitability for mixing.



I have primarily observed mixing professionals using specifically open-back headphones. Nevertheless, I believe this headphones could work well for mixing, considering their tuning. Although I am not a technical expert, I feel confident in my assessment.



Now, let‚Äôs talk about the sound. They do sound like an In-Ear Monitor (IEM) that covers the ear, but more specifically, a basshead IEM, which is why I mentioned Division as a basshead headphone. The tuning is quite easy to understand. The bass region features a bass shelf that gradually descends and flattens out before 300Hz, resulting in less bloated and boomy bass. However, they provide excellent body to the overall presentation and give the mids a warm quality. The upper midrange and lower treble are well-forwarded to compensate for the impactful bass, which it achieves effortlessly and cleanly.



Another reason why I consider this headphones good is that Kiwi Ears designed them without any unique or proprietary technology. They simply took the body of a headphone, two drivers, and a bit of dampening. Of course, I haven‚Äôt opened this headphones to inspect the internals, but honestly, it doesn‚Äôt matter for such an affordable pair.



Now, let‚Äôs delve deeper into the critical evaluation of this headphones before reaching a verdict.¬†



**Bass**¬†



On the graph, this headphone showed a really well-emphasized frequency range from 30Hz to 250Hz, which is great on paper. However, while listening, the bass tends to sound thumping and booming, which can sometimes become a bit bloated. This was the result of pairing this headphones with a Class A amplifier.



When I listened to this headphones with low gain or any other device with a headphone jack, the response sounded well-controlled, bodied, and dynamic. Of course, I have other headphones that are much better in terms of bass delivery, offering better impact, resolution, and dynamics. However, I found this headphones to be really well-done for the price.



The drums, kicks, toms, and bass slams sound full-bodied and hit hard without overemphasizing or sounding booming over the overall presentation. Listening to tracks from Skrillex, such as ‚ÄúTaka,‚Äù ‚ÄúRumble,‚Äù and ‚ÄúXena,‚Äù the drops were deep, impactful, and hard-hitting, well-controlled and composed.



While listening to metal tracks like ‚ÄúSkin & Bones‚Äù by Silverstein and ‚ÄúThy Art Is Murder‚Äù by Keres, the drums, toms, and bass slams sounded meaty and weighty. However, busy sections of this tracks made it difficult to hear the upper frequencies.¬†



**Mid Range**



Now, I‚Äôm particularly impressed with these headphones because, on their first attempt, Kiwi Ears managed to achieve a closed-back design that delivers great sound quality, particularly in the midrange. The response has a good emphasis in the midrange that allows forwardness and liveliness to blend well, making the vocals the center stage while the instruments complement them. The notes didn‚Äôt have any sharpness or peakiness, resulting in a soft sound.¬†



The female vocals have a nice body and lack weight, which gives them a pleasant tonality and cleanliness. In contrast, the male vocals have good girth. The instruments, whether percussion, strings, or others, sound wholesome and well-presented in the mix, but the contrast between them was lacking. Overall, the response is forward, energetic, and lively.



For example, listening to tracks like ‚ÄúLabyrinth‚Äù by Hockrockb, the vocals sounded forward and clean, with a good body and spread-out sound. However, there were a few ‚Äúss‚Äù sounds that became noticeable. Regarding the instruments, they sounded rich and well-presented, blending seamlessly with the vocals.



Another track, ‚ÄúThe Feels‚Äù by Labrinth, sounded well-flourished. The vocals, whether female or male, were well-presented. The male vocals had the right weight and tone, while the female vocals were too dense to sound airy and expressive.



**Treble**¬†



Another fantastic aspect of these headphones is their treble region. It‚Äôs exceptionally well-extended, sounding complete and full without any sibilance or harshness in the upper or lower frequencies. This is achieved thanks to the emphasis in the 100-200Hz range, which creates a warm and balanced sound.



The overall presentation of the notes is warm and rich, rather than lean and crisp. The treble is well-extended and has a good sense of space and air for a closed-back headphone. The energy is well-controlled, which helps to maintain a tonally favorable sound. The lower treble also resonates well with the upper midrange, as the vocals and instruments have a forwardness and cleanliness that is both lively and lean.



Tracks like ‚ÄúOverfly‚Äù by Luna Haruna sounded exceptionally extended, with the vocals sounding fuller and more open, and the instruments like cymbals and percussion having clear and well-defined notes.¬†



**Technical Specifications**



Well, to be honest, I don‚Äôt find much out of the ordinary when it comes to speaking about technical aspects of the Division. Most closed-back headphones don‚Äôt sound great for technical prowess, whether it‚Äôs the staging, resolution, or separation. The same can be said for other closed-back headphones I‚Äôve compared them to.



When it comes to staging, imaging, and separation, I don‚Äôt have much to say except that the imaging is clean but not precise. The staging is wide enough to sound spacious for a closed-back headphone, but the separation between the notes is not very distinctive.



Now, the resolution is quite good. The macro details are well-surfaced, while the micro details suffer. The attack and decay of the notes are quick-paced, which is enough to prevent the sound from sounding muddy or messy. ¬†



**Impressions & Comparisons**¬†



**Sources**



https://preview.redd.it/yzp4x6z997fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=47cfb221ae7b811a2ca77d1c4d088a6fd2b3c77c

**Sony WM1A -** While listening to Division with WM1A, the response sounded more balanced and mature, with better control across the entire frequency spectrum. The bass was a bit loose but warm, less punchy yet thick, especially compared to other pairings. The midrange was airy and open, particularly the female vocals, and even the instruments sounded vibrant and lively with excellent distinction. In terms of the treble, the response was refined in my opinion. It was as extended as before but smoother and better in revealing the notes.



https://preview.redd.it/palwsubc97fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9fc41e289fe7dfc23cf5dd32406ee5bab6ac1e1

**FiiO M15S -** While listening to Division with M15S, the response was energetic across the entire frequency spectrum, allowing for a wider range of expressions and greater impact. The bass was punchier and more controlled, while the midrange had a forwarded but slightly clustered response. The treble region was well-emphasized, resulting in a clearer and shimmering sound.¬†



**Comparisons**



**AKG K361 and Division**



https://preview.redd.it/grg1wvgd97fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92dd07ab85eab5f46c6231bc4861ba8bea70e67

To be honest, conducting an A&B test revealed that the K361 sounded more artificial than the Division. The reason behind this is that the Division offered a more immersive and prominent bass presence during listening. Additionally, the vocals and instruments in the Division were better expressed and tonally rich. However, when it comes to the overall presentation, the K361 excels. It surpasses the Division in terms of its comprehensive presentation, revealing more details and achieving a better balance and note revelation. Despite its higher price point, I had expected the K361 to deliver overall better sound.¬†



**Division and Sony MDR7506**¬†



https://preview.redd.it/ns8wzt9e97fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=f939cc91722df2cb37729083972bac9b84463b62

Well, in my opinion, the revealing set and perhaps a bit too much is the 7506. It offers better contrast and clarity. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the lean factor across the presentation makes the Division a favorable choice. As the notes have a better body and weight, they sound warm, rich, and more balanced in terms of dynamics and forwardness. Now that I know K361 is as expensive as the 7506, I believe the 7506 has a more airy and revealing sound compared to the K361, while the Division has a richer and more dynamic sound than the 7506.¬†

Division is undoubtedly one of the best choices within the $50 price segment, which is why I believe Kiwi Ears offered this at the most affordable price possible. Considering the convenience and sound quality, it makes perfect sense for someone with a budget of $50-60 to spend on a fun and engaging headphone. While I understand that bassheads will likely appreciate this, I can‚Äôt comment on their suitability for mixing professionals since I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to try other professional-grade headphones in this price range. I was particularly excited to compare this to the Takstar Pro 82. However, I must reiterate that I love these headphones just as much as I love my AKG K361 and Sony MDR 7506. These casual wear headphones are suitable for basic consumers because they tend to sound very favorable towards the general population, similar to any Harman-tuned product.

The phono preamp? I would likely go ifi again. I like their products. They are compact, don't gouge the wallet, and they work.

Or the cartridge? Looking at the AT-VM540ML or Ortofon Bronze. I haven't been convinced that the Ortofon Black is worth the price at this point from reviews.

Question: how do I prevent a sub from having too much power run to it?,CarAV,1i9w1n2,2025-01-25 15:21:51,0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1i9w1n2/question_how_do_i_prevent_a_sub_from_having_too/,ZachCreighton,Discussion,"This is a silly question but it confuses me.

Problem is, the JBL system gets really loud and I don‚Äôt want to have to run it at max volume just to get maximum subwoofer output. It‚Äôs too loud to do so for me. I also don‚Äôt want to have to run the head unit at a lower volume while the sub is at max volume and have the risk of it getting turned up too much on accident and damaging either the sub or the amp.

A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,HealthyZapper,1i9vk1k,2025-01-25 15:00:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1i9vk1k/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,AutoModerator,Keto,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved."
Can‚Äôt get rid of terrible delay,rocksmith,1i9vhms,2025-01-25 14:57:32,0,0.25,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocksmith/comments/1i9vhms/cant_get_rid_of_terrible_delay/,Kinc4id,,"I got my guitar today and connected it to rocksmith via direct input.

How do I set this up correctly? And why does a game based on audio has no built in setting for input and output devices?

Edit: I can set ASIO4ALL as output in voicemeeter, then set A4A as Input for Rocksmith and at least it doesn't complain about no device and it gets a signal from the guitar but too quiet to even tone it."

For reference my regular listeners have been an older set of Dayton b652s and a T-amp and from a music quality perspective I would consider that level of sound quality acceptable. 

Budget $1000 all in, speakers don‚Äôt need to look good, open to a pair of speakers with or without sub/s as needed, hoping to learn enough to put together a dual sub system some day. If all of this is ridiculous and makes me sound like a novice beginner, that would make sense, help me find my way. Thanks!"

I have around 300‚Ç¨ to spend on a new pair of headphones and I'm located in the EU (Italy).

I want to go for headphones that are fun to listen to, and that are detailed above everything else. I like sparkly sounds, and I also like a very wide soundstage.  
I don't care much for super deep bass, I'm fine will the usual open-back bass rolloff.

I'll use these headphones at home, mostly for general music listening.  
My setup is all wired, I already have a DAC and Amp setup.

I listen to many different genres, but if it can be of some help, my favourite album is Daft Punk's RAM. What I love is headring all the different layers of the music and good instrument separation is a must.  
I don't need noise isolation at all.

My main problem with my only ever past headphones, the AKG K7xx, is that their build quality is pretty bad. They are very light and flimsy and the elastic bands failed almost immediately.  
Besides that, they are good headphones, not tiring at all for me, but they are not the most detailed. Without EQ they are a bit muddy and dark.

As a final note, any type of driver is fine, but I'm keen on exploring planar magnetics. I listened to a friend's Hifiman HE4xx and they were pretty cool."

But this is askanelectrician, so lets just focus on giving answers. If you want to gatekeep ill just go electrocute myself in peace :) 

I just did something and it seems to have corrected ithe problem somehow. I took an old extention cord, cut off the two prongs and left the ground pin. I then plugged it into an outlet without gfi, spliced the ground wire from this cord to the hot ground in the junction. Turned it on, some lights flickered. Now, after removing the extention cord ground and turning the power back on in the junction, the ground  is no longer hot and everything reads normal?..

Also, afterwards I opened the panel and saw that the ground wasnt even connected. It was floating awfully close to the panel box too üò¨

I do have some questions because this isn't making sense to me.. 

1.How in the world did that work???

2.Why would there be any voltage in the ground if it's floating (now reads 0 on the multimeter but the non contact tester still beeps when touching it)

2.1. Why are there more floating grounds and should I connect them to the bar?

3. How is it that earlier the ground to black was 120 v and ground to red was 0 v?

4. Is that neutral supposed to be connected to that 25 amp breaker?"

Receiver/AMP - NAD M33

Speakers: B&W 804D4s

Subwoofers: (2) KEF KC92s

TV; 77"" LG G3

I would like to purchase a Blue Ray/CD player for my system, so I was looking at the Magnetar UDP800, or could go for the Panny 9000, which does not have SACD and the quality of sound output as the UDP800.

¬†

My question is, does it make sense to get a high end Blue Ray/CD player for audio? or is the DAC in the NAD superior, so it basically is a waste of money? and I should just get a cheaper blue ray player, like the Panny 820? and how would I wire it? HDMI through the TV and then to the NAD for movies through ARC, and coaxial direct to the NAD for stereo CD listening?

I understand that the fan is reacting to the load from the amp, meaning that the more you crank the amp the more heat the fan will try to dissipate. I normally run my Powerball master volume around 9. Will it be low enough so that the fan does not spin or will it spin at high speed even at a relativ low master volume setting?

i would love to hear from people that use a 100W tube amps for silent practicing at home with the two notes captor.

Connection info:

* Lights are connected in parallel (for now) power supply -> controller -> 16ft led -> 16ft led -> 16ft led -> 9ft led
* The controller is set to the ""blue"" light which the manual says is for RGBCCT LEDs

**App**

* Smart Life 

**Issues**

**1. Lights won't turn off**

The lights turn on when I use the app, and I can change the white temperature and colors. 

The problem is the lights will not shut off when I turn them off with the app. I redid all the wiring and tried using just one string of lights. Regardless, they will not turn off.

I don't know if this is the way I have them wired or something with the controller.

  
**2. Brightness and color temp drop over the run.** 

By the end of the light run the brightness drops off and when its set to a color the temp changes. 

I know that over long runs this can happen with lower power transformers, but I thought I had one with enough total wattage to handle it. 

So the question really is

A. Is this transformer the correct one for this amount of lights?  
B. if so, would it work better if I connect the power to both ends?  
And if so, how does the wiring for that work where you have a single controller?

Help in selecting an Emporia Level 2 charger,evcharging,1i9uhq9,2025-01-25 14:13:43,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9uhq9,JSherwood-reddit,,"Hi folks,
I am looking at ordering a NACS hardwired charger. I will be installing a solar system next month and getting a 120 volt outlet in my garage upgraded to 240 capacity for an EV charger. The solar installation company say they will wire in the EV charger if I have it there ready to go. So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm attaching my best understanding of my electrical setup, and Emporia‚Äôs EV charger options.
My best guess is that I should be ordering the EV charger with Energy Management or the EV manager with Power Smart?
Some possibly relevant  factors:
Solar will use Enphase micro inverters with whole house back up 
I have a solar ready 200 amp main service panel, with (2) 100 amp circuits leading back to  -> Panel A 100 amps, covering most of the house 
and  ‚Äî> Panel B 100 amp panel in the garage (which has a 50 amp circuit dedicated to a subsidiary panel in the workshop). The circuit for the EV will be in Panel B, and will be a poled 60 amp circuit - (2)30 amp circuits combined. Hopefully the diagram will make this layout clear!
I plan to also add a HWHP to replace my gas hot water heater. It will be in the workshop, which already has a 240 volt outlet. BTW, ‚Äòworkshop‚Äô is a bit misleading - I‚Äôm not using power hungry equipment.

I think that I should be buying the Energy Management option to coordinate with the solar, but should I be buying the one with PowerSmart to future proof? 
Apologies if I‚Äôve misstated anything - I‚Äôm at the nexus of not knowing much about electrical wiring, EV charging and solar unfortunately.

Wireless audio reality check,audiophile,1i9uhi6,2025-01-25 14:13:28,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1i9uhi6/wireless_audio_reality_check/,pointthinker,Science & Tech,"I was poking around one well known system for lossless audio transmission to speakers (like Airplay, but not Airplay).

When streaming to a single device, it maintains high-resolution audio quality as needed. There is some variability due to file type but the max range is 24/96-192 on their consumer to high end brands. Also DSD up to 11.2MHz (DSD on applicable devices, not all)

Audio quality reduces to CD-quality (16-bit/44.1kHz) when streaming to 2-3 devices simultaneously. This seems quite acceptable due to the issues in home networks handling this much all at once. IOW: a 2-4 bedroom size home/apartment party mode is CD quality. That is great.

Further compression occurs when streaming to more than 3 devices. This is also acceptable for a much bigger home! It is not like you are doing critical listening at a big party in your big mansion. LOL

Most wireless is like this or fixed lower even more so. At best, it adapts quality down to the increased number of devices it sends to. The companies don't like to go into details, which leads many to assume their Acme Wireless Audio is always and only sending 24/192. Probably not. ChromeCast/GoogleCast limitations can also vary depending on the specific implementation, the streaming app being used, and the receiving devices. For example: Amazon Music limits Chromecast streaming to 44.1kHz, even when higher quality is available.

Considering Apple is a consumer company, I can see why they kept Airplay 1 as 16/44 (AirPlay expanded its compatibility to non-Apple products in 2010 ‚Äî 15 years ago) but Airplay 2, which is about more than one playback device, would be set to AAC 256. (The two are indistinguishable for most humans.) Considering that users can stream 24/48 lossless on an Apple TV HD/4K or; HomePods directly with voice or via Control Other option. The key word is ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù. Which works for 95% of us humans.

I am playing it on a 13 year old AVR with Airplay 1 as I type. 

I don't need it but, I am going to talk about it anyway: Given the following conditions, bit-perfect transmission of 16/44.1 lossless files via AirPlay 1 from macOS 15.2 to an AirPlay 1 receiving device is possible if:

\- The AirPlay Volume Interlock is set to ""Off"". You might have to go to the non Apple devices web page to change this setting. Older Apple brand Airplay 1 receiving devices have this off all the time and it can't be changed.

\- The sending device's volume is set to maximum. Do this only once you hit play to be safe. Apple seems to auto set the volume very low no matter what when starting play this way. Probably due to no Airplay 1 volume interlock.

\- Volume control is done at the receiving end (amp). Make sure your when turned on, auto default volume setting is low on the amp too. Just to be safe. But since Apple has it low from source (until you turn it to 100% at source), it is not an issue. Some say you should do the opposite but, then any shot at bit-perfect is gone.

\- The original file is 16-bit/44.1kHz ALAC (most of my entire ripped from CD collection). If I am streaming Apple Music from the internets at 24/96 and Apple's excellent audio processor bumps that one song down to 16/44 for Airplay, I can live with that to work in the kitchen or sit on a couch and veg out.

This scenario would result in bit-perfect transmission because:

\- AirPlay 1 protocol uses a fixed format of 44,100 frames per second, 16-bit linear PCM, interleaved stereo, losslessly compressed in ALAC.

\- When sending 16/44.1 ALAC files, no transcoding is necessary since the source matches the AirPlay 1 transmission format. This is also key to this working.

\- With Volume Interlock off and sending volume at maximum, no volume adjustments are made during transmission, preserving the original data. As long as the file was 16/44, like CD RIPs and a whole heck of a lot of music for streaming, still, it remains ideal.

\- AirPlay 1 is capable of lossless ALAC streaming up to 44.1 kHz.

\- When streaming from a Mac using AirPlay, the audio remains ALAC 16/44.11.

Bit-perfect transmission only applies to 16/44.1 ALAC files from any source. Higher resolution files would be downsampled to match the AirPlay 1 protocol specifications. No biggie in my book. This scenario is specific to AirPlay 1 receiving devices.

The transmission can be considered bit-perfect in this scenario.

Sorry if I repeated things or had any minor errors. My technical editor died 30 years ago so is unavailable to check the copy. But I had a little help from a friend ü§ñ because, AV and tech companies could not have made a more opaque and technically byzantine wireless audio group of ecosystem if they tried. "
White noise and speakers popping with aftermarket head unit,mk6gti,1i9ugpf,2025-01-25 14:12:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mk6gti/comments/1i9ugpf/white_noise_and_speakers_popping_with_aftermarket/,jasonwilliams10,,"I am putting a Kenwood 8709S in my 2010 with the DynAudio system. I have the Maestro RR to keep the steering wheel controls and the harness to make everything plug and play, but with the volume down, there is white noise coming through the speakers, and any time I adjust the volume, I hear a thump through the speakers. I have tried to change the Maestro gains and the input source level on the head unit, and neither made a difference. I used to install stereos professionally, but it has been years since I messed with it. Since it feeds the amp input from the speaker level output on the head unit, is it too much power going into the amp and causing the issues? To me, this is what it sounds like from past experiences. Has anyone tried to put RCA ends on the speaker wires in the harness and connect them to the RCA outputs on a head unit to feed the factory amp lower voltage?"

Please note that this alternator was refurbished meaning all the inside components are new.


The auxiliary fan was wired directly so it would start working as soon as ignition, in summary, it broke and I took it off, the difference with and without that fan is about 0.2 -0.3V which shouldn‚Äôt represent anything huge.

I‚Äôve been driving with these voltage readings for about 3 months and the battery light doesn‚Äôt turn ON, UNLESS I‚Äôm parked with AC full blast and fog lights the battery light will slightlyyyyyyyy turn ON to the point you‚Äôre only able to see it if you‚Äôre parked in complete darkness.

Changing electrical cord on stove,appliancerepair,1i9ug02,2025-01-25 14:11:41,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliancerepair/comments/1i9ug02/changing_electrical_cord_on_stove/,d1jeditech,,"Have a new to us stove.  Current stove has what I believe is a NEMA 14-50R connector (current outlet matches).  On the stove connection it has 4 wires connected, red, white, black and green.  The green ground goes to a dedicated ground screw below the other connectors, into the stove body.

The new stove has I believe a NEMA 10-50 connector, only 3 wires (not color coded but believe it goes L-R black, white, red, based on the color on the stove wiring.  My concern, the new stove has a green ground screw, but it appears to have a copper plate connecting it to the white screw assembly.

  
Question: Can I put the NEMA 14-50R cord on the new stove with the ground wire going into the green ground screw?  Looks like I have slack enough or can turn the cord so as to line up correctly.  Or do I need to get a different cord, that goes from the NEMA 14-50R connector to just 3 wires?  Or is it get an electrician to put in a 10-50 to match the new stove configuration?

Don't know if it matters on this question, but the current breaker is a 40 amp.

Appreciate any input."

GFCI breaker keeps tripping randomly...,electrical,1i9ua83,2025-01-25 14:04:55,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/electrical/comments/1i9ua83/gfci_breaker_keeps_tripping_randomly/,TheCutter00,,"So this has been a super annoying process.  If I had to do it all over again I would just have hardwired my electrical car charger, and to be honest, I wish our electrician had recommended we do that, because I'm not an expert and just thought the Nema 14-50 would be more convenient.

But due to a combination of Los Angeles area ridiculously extreme permitting process I now deal with a 50amp GFCI breaker that trips daily at random... even when I'm not charging my vehicle.

I won't even get into the mess of the permitting approval where I originally had a 50amp non-GFCI breaker rejected that was working perfectly. Requested by moron inspector to downgrade it to a 40amp gfci to match my 40amp Autel nema-14-50 charger.  (Cause as the inspector said moronically.. the breaker can't be larger amperage than the max output of the box which was 40amps.)

So we jump through hoops... finally get it approved by another inspector who said.. this should be 50amp.. but signed off on it anyway.

But now my electrician installed a 50amp GFCI and it already tripped in the first 24 hours.  Installer said he hates the GFCI breakers... But this has been a 6 month process at this point getting everything installed for a simple 50 foot run from box car charger.

If i have to flip the breaker on a daily basis I'll do it... but it's just annoying to have this problem.  I could pay more to hardwire it also, but at this point I'm just so over the whole process and as long as it's SAFE.. I'll probably just deal with the breaker tripping randomly.

So my question is... my 50 amp breaker tripping due to most likely a conflict with my Autel's built in GFCI is entirely safe and just a annoying thing i'll have to do like flipping a light switch daily?"
NAD: DOWNgraded to an Orange Micro Dark‚Ä¶and I love it!,GuitarAmps,1i9u8gt,2025-01-25 14:02:50,8,0.91,0,https://i.redd.it/90ywiu13u6fe1.jpeg,Hipster_Dragon,AMP PHOTO,"After getting a Pod Go, I‚Äôve gone full digital as far as guitar amp preamps. The last couple of years I‚Äôve only used my Rockerverb‚Äôs power section, plugging the preamp model directly into the return of the FX loop. 

What I have found is that I can get way better tone at bedroom levels using amp models. Tube amps need to be pushed really hard/loud to get the actual tonal benefits of the tubes, which is way too loud for bedroom playing. Models on the other hand can get that fully saturated and ‚Äúfull‚Äù sound you‚Äôre looking for at comfortable levels. 

Additionally, with models I have a whole slew of amps to choose from. On the Pod Go the Litigator and Twin Reverb models have been my favorite. (I do have a Rockerverb model, but I don‚Äôt use it, maybe I should try it. üòÇ) It‚Äôs really cool having 60+ amps at your finger tips and being able to swap them in and out. 

As far as modeling is concerned, there is no tonal difference between the Rockerverb and Micro Dark when it comes to amp modeling. All they are doing is upping the signal of the modeled preamp using their respective power sections, which doesn‚Äôt really color or manipulate the sound. 

I ended up getting the Micro Dark, because I was honestly tired of all the hiss and crackle that comes with tube amps. Even at low volumes it can be really hissy, and this is not fixed by just using a noise gate. The Micro dark is completely silent, which is all I need it to do. 

Next step I would like to use the Micro dark amp as intended. I haven‚Äôt actually plugged it in the input, but I‚Äôm sure it sounds great, if not better than my Rockerverb at bedroom levels. 

As far as alternatives for modeling like I‚Äôm doing here, which is different than using FRFR, there are really only 3 good options on the market that I see:
1. Orange Micro Dark
2. Orange Terror Stamp
3. Orange Pedal Baby

I didn‚Äôt go with the terror stamp, because I just didn‚Äôt like the pedal form factor. I just like the cute little lunchbox with front facing controls. The pedal baby would have worked but it was $400 and way more wattage than I needed. The micro dark is only 20W (which is more than enough and easier to tame at bedroom levels) and only costs $200, making it basically the cheapest ‚Äúpower amp‚Äù on the market. 

Feel free to shoot me questions on amp modeling or with my setup. I find it hilarious that after getting a Rockerverb I ended up downgrading all the way back to the most entry level amp Orange sells‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm super happy with my purchase! Especially with new amps costing $2000-$3000."
