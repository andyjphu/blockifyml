I know that both Big A and most of the fanbase aren‚Äôt big on crypto, but I‚Äôve been a crypto bro since 2020, and I genuinely believe crypto will outperform most other assets. This isn‚Äôt meant to be anything hateful or contrarian‚ÄîI've been watching Big A for years, and while we don‚Äôt see eye to eye on crypto, we agree on pretty much everything else.

That said, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is, if Big A ""The Glizzlord"" Atrioc is down, I am willing to bet $1000 for charity. I followed the same rules as everyone else and built my own portfolio based on the competition format:

* $1,000 per pick ($10,000 total)
* 10 picks total
* Bought on January 23rd after I saw the VOD (Europe frog here)

Imma share some projects that I'm keeping an eye on, most of these coins are not being exchanged on any CEX only on Saucerswap ($SAUCE pioneer dex on HEDERA) this one is currently available on BItget\\MEXC.

\-$HSUITE - 57M mcap - DeFI tool with an innovative tech called smart-nodes to build defi apps. (saucerswap competition) DYOR

\-$KARATE - 12.9M mcap - The first fan-governed stricking league in real world. Holders can vote on favorite fighters before each KC event using the Karate Combat app (i use it myself and the app its very clean) currently theres a thing called ""up only gaming"" where you dont lose your tokens even if you guess it wrong. DYOR

\-$DOVU - 8.4 mcap - It claims to be a tansparent supply of green credits (Tokenization and sale of ecological credits, targeting the global voluntary carbon market. DYOR

\-$BSL - 5.5 mcap - Utilizes DLT tech built on Hedera to provide banking services such credit unions, loans, fraud management. Some guy on the hedera sub claims to have his BSL wallet drained and this as been a topic of conversations on hedera sub. DYOR

\-$CLXY - 4.7M mcap - Calaxy is a decentralized social media platform, a merge between web2 social platforms into a web3 infrastructure. DYOR

\-$MINGO - 1.88M mcap - Web3 ecosystem with comprehensive digital services such wallet, gaming plantform, NFT marketplace, and NFT ticketing service that enhaces the utility and security of event tickets for organizations and attendees. DYOR

\-$DAVINCI - 1.7 mcap - Offers a suite of token management tools such locking tokens, vesting, burning, on-chain management and token logo handling. Has nfts with airdrop system. DYOR

\-MEMECOINS - the most popular coins on the network are $GRELF, $HBARbarian, $SPACEAPE and many new recently created but with a decent liquidity that can be a scam idk such $IVY, $DINO, $SMACKM, $HONK, $esco, $AZOR, $HOODIE, $2FingersInu...

Obviously do your own research this is NFA. In my opinion the was HEDERA is becoming so popular it's a matter of time before projects built on its network start to explode.

"Last Chance to Turn $1000 to $30,000 This Cycle? Expert Names 3 Altcoins With Best Upside",draqai,1i5lllf,2025-01-20 03:21:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i5lllf/last_chance_to_turn_1000_to_30000_this_cycle/,MammothBattle33,,"üöÄ Crypto Lovers, Ready to Flip $1,000 into $30,000? Here‚Äôs the Juicy Scoop üçë  

The crypto space is ablaze with chatter about three altcoin gems that could light up your portfolio: $HBAR, $XRP, and the spicy newcomer, DTX Exchange (DTX). Buckle up, because things are heating up in the market. üî•  

Let‚Äôs start with Hedera‚Äôs $HBAR. With a powerful 35.7% blast-off this week, it‚Äôs trading at $0.3988, edging closer to its previous all-time high of $0.4323. Coinbase Prime has just added custody services for $HBAR, pulling in big institutional players. Trading volume tripled to a steamy $2.3 billion, while the market cap strutted up to $14.14 billion. Oh, $HBAR is clearly doing the most! üíÉ  

Next up, Ripple‚Äôs $XRP is riding high on good vibes. After legal wins and whispers of an ETF, its price popped by 42% this week, landing at $3.24. Analysts are fanning the flames of $XRP hype, forecasting $4 in no time. The big whales are in, snagging up $XRP faster than my last online shopping spree. üåä  

And now, let‚Äôs talk about that underdog making major waves, DTX Exchange (DTX). Their hybrid approach to trading is like mixing business with pleasure‚Äîsmooth, efficient, and ridiculously attractive. With over 120k trading products, a jaw-dropping 1000x leverage, and presale earnings already hitting $11.8M, DTX is on fire. You better get in while the token‚Äôs still at $0.14, because once it hits $0.2, it‚Äôs going to be a whole new level of üî•.  

Crypto babes and memecoin maniacs, it‚Äôs time to flex on the market. Play your cards right, and one of these altcoins might just take you to the moon. üåï  

What are you waiting for? Wink at destiny and dive in! üòò

I'm following regularly some other communities, for coins I have, like WIF and HBAR, and as much I see Hedera/HBAR as the technically most sophisticated network and Solana as the maybe worst, the general reaction to TRUMP within the HBAR community is mostly very arrogant, full of depreciation towards memecoins and full of hate against President Trump. And WIF shows just ‚Ä¶ well, nothing, no activity, no engagement, no energy, like a very old, tired dog. So sad.

In contrast to especially Hedera, in our community, here and on X and Telegram, I saw, regarding the Trump Coin, almost no whining, no accusations or self-pity! Instead, mature conversations, discussions and suggestions about possible tactics and strategies, about how to make the best out of any situation and any scenario! That is what I was always looking for! No baseless hopium, but self-reflected and realistic perspective with a positive and motivating state of mind!

In my opinion, if the ETF gets approved, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the price reach $2. 

It‚Äôs not just about the ETF right now, I think we are still the most underrated token for the following reasons:

- Best DLT
- Use cases coming up (e.g., Nvidia/Intel)
- RWA (Real-World Assets)
- Likely this year, the governing council will be complete (+7 new members, hoping one could be Apple/Microsoft/BlackRock/Nvidia/Visa, etc.)
- ETF (probably we will receive approval before Solana and XRP) 
- Currently, we have about $15 billion in market cap with nearly 80% of the supply released (XRP has double the market cap with less than 60% released and is valued at nearly $200 billion, + $130 billion just in November). 
- Many XRP investors will likely reinvest their profits into HBAR.
- Few people still know about Hedera/HBAR (on X, we just passed 400k followers). 
- If we manage to get into the top 10 by market cap, it could generate massive hype.

And if we factor in the crypto tax exemption in the U.S., we could be looking at the biggest bull run in history, and in my opinion, HBAR could easily surpass $3.

HBAR was easily idling around .05 before this last run.  Give or take.  XRP was idling around .50, give or take.  You see that little decimal point?  It‚Äôs important.

If you had miraculously bought $10,000 in HBAR at .05 and sold at its recent high of .40, that would be $80,000, a x8 on your investment.

Same thing, $10,000 in XRP at .50 at its peak of 3.40 the other day, would be worth $68,000.

I am arguing HBAR has shown better ‚Äúprice‚Äù action by a long shot, what‚Äôs to be paid attention to now in my opinion is that HBAR may have just hit a double top.  I think we could possibly see a retrace to .18-.20 range, it‚Äôs really tough to tell, just food for thought."

Here is an interesting return from ChatGPT comparing the two:

# Overview

# XLM (Stellar)

* **Founded**: 2014
* **Technology**: Blockchain-based ledger.
* **Use Case**: Focuses on cross-border payments, remittances, and tokenizing assets.

* **Use Case**: Enterprise-grade solutions for payments, tokenization, decentralized applications (dApps), and data integrity.
* **Consensus Mechanism**: Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) consensus.
* **Notable Features**:
   * Extremely high transaction speed (10,000+ TPS).
   * Energy-efficient and eco-friendly.
   * Governed by a council of global enterprises (e.g., Google, IBM, Boeing).

# Key Comparisons

   * Energy-efficient, aligning with growing ESG trends.
   * Diverse use cases beyond payments (e.g., supply chain, identity).
* **Weaknesses**:
   * Perceived centralization due to its council governance model.
   * Still in the growth phase with relatively less adoption compared to larger blockchain networks.

# Upside Potential

# XLM (Stellar):

* **Upside Factors**:
   * Global remittance markets are expanding rapidly, offering opportunities for XLM to capture market share.
   * Increased adoption in underbanked regions.
   * Partnerships with financial institutions could drive usage.
* **Challenges**:
   * Competes directly with Ripple (XRP) and other blockchain networks in the same niche.

# HBAR (Hedera):

* **Upside Factors**:
   * Adoption by enterprises through partnerships with council members.
   * Use cases extend beyond payments, addressing industries like healthcare, supply chain, and more.
   * Superior technology positions it well for scaling as Web3 evolves.
* **Challenges**:
   * Educating the market on Hashgraph technology and overcoming the centralization critique.

# Which Has More Upside?

* **Short-term**: HBAR appears to have more immediate upside due to its enterprise partnerships, advanced technology, and unique value proposition in diverse industries. Its energy efficiency and council governance resonate well with ESG-conscious investors.
* **Long-term**: Both have potential, but **HBAR** may edge out due to its scalability and broader applicability. XLM could perform well if it can secure dominance in cross-border payments and remittances, especially in underbanked regions.

  
I personally would give the upside more to XLM from what I've read."

But that's not the only thing in the Hedera ecosystem that's been flying high.

As recently we saw a collaboration on Hedera that even involved SpaceX in an initiative to bring post quantum semiconductor tech to satellites in space.

There were multiple key parts in this task.

SPACEX was responsible of the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket into space.

WiSeKey's 6 satellites under their subsidiary WiSeSat was then deployed in space thanks to the Falcon 9.

SEALSQ, another subsidiary of WiSeKey had developed post quantum secure semiconductors within each satellite.

Hedera was then used within SEALSQ to enable secure quantum resistant transactions for IoT devices.

This is collaboration is truly out of this world.

We're now seeing Hedera launched to the stratosphere and securing data transactions from space & of course doing so with mutual ties to SpaceX!

This is bigger than DePIN or crypto.

The market valuation of space is estimated to be worth of trillions by 2030.

And it looks like Hedera's already playing a key role in the early innovations.

I had one of the worst days recently that came to a good end with HBAR. Need some advice and don't have anyone in life to ask other than my barber who hates hbar.,Hedera,1i3avo5,2025-01-17 02:10:16,31,0.88,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1i3avo5/i_had_one_of_the_worst_days_recently_that_came_to/,Kassssler,Discussion,"So I'm gonna ramble a bit. Today when it pumped I decide to take some profit. I had around 40k HBAR in a dcent wallet. Today I sent 19.979 HBAR to an exchange to sell some of it. 

Normally when I transferred it took at tops 20 seconds. a minute stretched into 5, then half an hour, than an hour. I began to panic. I called customer support and waited for two and a half hours to chat with a support agent named Pankaj. I gave him all the info, and 20 minutes in he ended the chat without a word and I have a bot asking me ""Did we solve your issue?""

I basically lose my shit, I try more customer support methods, ask for a call back, go to work, my coworkers noticed I'm all fucked up so a very gracious one askes a friend to cover for me so I could get the fuck out of there. 

I'm thinking my Hbar is gone, and now a shining opportunity with a bright future has me about 5k in the hole. 

Fast forward to 12am and I'm playing fucking video games and I get a callback from coinbase. After about an hour of giving them more info and being on hold they actually credit me the 20k hbar I thought was fucking gone forever. Props to coinbase support it took over 12 hours to get a call back but I got my shit back. Its at a cost average higher than what I sent, but I rather have 90% of it back than 100% of nothing. 

So that is the backstory. 

When this transaction got lost I don't know how to impress upon you that I double checked and triple checked everything. The address, memo, etc the only thing I didn't do was send a small amount of hbar first as a test. 

When I sent the transaction in the morning I used my desktop. Later in the day when I checked hbar through my phone after pressing receive I got a notification popup saying ""HBAR transactions re-enabled, update your app or funds may be lost""

This warning did not come up when I made the transaction from desktop. My coinbase app did not auto update either even though i have all apps set to do that. 

I wanted to say this in part cause I want to warn everyone no matter where you send crypto, always test a little first. Don't be like me and send over seven thousand dollars in one transaction cause my fucking entire day was a hellscape of shattered ambitions and regret.

The question I have after I say all this is I'm very fucking paranoid right now, not sure if I should put the coins back on my dcent wallet or just leave them on the exchange. Thank you for listening if you actually read all this. 

P.S My barber hates Hbar cause hes big on XRP. Its all he talks about if I bring up Hedera he looks at me like I'm stuffing a dead cat into my mouth."

Not only did they launch their technology into orbit with a satellite from spacex ... their price is launching too!

Currently testing the .35-.38 zone... highly probability of .40s tomorrow.

Macd is just getting started! First green bar on the ""round the top"" has began. Very rarely is there only one. Not only that, generaly they get bigger! (Look at macd indicator history)

Stochastic rsi is bullish and pointing up from oversold

This is not financial advice.

2. No ability to send / receive native USDC to/from CEXs (yet). Significant friction in increasing USDC liquidity still exists to this day.
3. No U.S.-based HBAR ETF is live yet (1 pending).
4. No HBAR ETF yet from Blackrock, Fidelity, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Valkyrie and so on.
5. Hedera tokens are not supported on major CEXs yet (e.g., Binance or Coinbase). When Hedera tokens perform well, there will be increased demand for HBAR as it is needed to buy Hedera tokens from SaucerSwap DEX for the best swap ratio.
6. A crypto-friendly U.S. administration is incoming (Hedera, being U.S.-based, will benefit from this).
7. New SEC chair that will be crypto friendly
8. Big use cases (high TPS using paid HBAR, not subsidized) are not yet online.
9. Anonymous community nodes are not online yet
10. 33% away from ATH (\~$0.57). XRP: 3% away from ATH ($3.4). SUI: Already at ATH. Solana: 19.5% away from ATH.
11. The top meme coin on Hedera has only \~$5 million in market cap. For comparison: Polygon: $750 million. SUI: $150 million. ETH: $7.5 billion.
12. Many big influencers are not shilling HBAR yet
13. Bonzo (lending and borrowing) with $44 million in TVL. For comparison: Aave from ETH: $35 billion in TVL
14. HBAR market cap: $14 billion. For comparison: XRP market cap: $188 billion (at least 10x from here), Solana: $103 billion (at least 7x from here), Cardano: $40 billion (about 3x from here).
15. Dogecoin, a memecoin, still got higher mcap than HBAR (market does not make sense atm.)
16. No clear crypto regulations yet. 

  
If you consider HBAR's technical capabilities, it is reasonable to expect it to have a market cap comparable to Solana, Cardano, or even XRP. HBAR operates as a general-purpose network capable of handling high TPS, offers best-in-class security (aBFT), is post-quantum resilient, has fixed and predictable fees pegged to USD, is well-decentralized in terms of node location and hosting providers, and has nearly 80% circulating supply."

Hedera is still in beta, the GC is not full yet, use cases have not yet begun to produce transactions, critical infrastructure has not yet started to be adapted for DLT, no HBAR ETF has yet been approved, the masses have not yet discovered HBAR, it's not yet permissionless, media coverage is still rather negligible, DeFi on Hedera is still in its infancy, many use cases are still being built ...

Hedera's fundamentals are and will remain superior to everything else. But what really will drive price action has not even started. What we're seeing now is a mere glimpse of what is about to come in probably just a very few years.

Stay excited!"

As awareness grows, so does the trend towards eco-friendly cryptocurrencies and sustainable mining practices. Imagine a world where your investments not only grow your wealth but also contribute to a healthier planet. That's the promise of green crypto projects. By investing in these eco-conscious initiatives, you're not just making a smart financial move‚Äîyou're also taking a stand for sustainability. It's a win-win for your portfolio and the planet!  

Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2025:  

Cardano (ADA): Known for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Cardano is a leader in sustainable blockchain technology.  
Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is committed to being carbon-negative, offsetting its small carbon footprint through partnerships with environmental organizations.  
Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR): This network uses a unique consensus algorithm that is highly energy-efficient, making it one of the greenest options out there.  
Chia (XCH): Chia uses a proof-of-space-and-time consensus mechanism, which is significantly less energy-intensive than traditional mining.  
Stellar (XLM): Stellar's consensus protocol is designed to be energy-efficient, making it a sustainable choice for eco-conscious investors.



Why don't cryptocurrency investors ever get lost?  
Because they always follow the blockchain!
