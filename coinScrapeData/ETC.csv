I am trying to get back into my hobby. I played guitar on and off for 15 years. I can read sheet music for piano, but can’t play sheet music on guitar. I always played via tabs. I am now trying to get into classical guitar to build up a new/old hobby. 

My problem now is, I am so dramatically overwhelmed. I have several books, I have access to Werner Bradfords online courses , etc . But I have no clue how to start , where to start , what routines to follow. Any tips how to get into a flowing routine that is fun ? Should I learn to play via sheet music ?  I would appreciate your input on this. In the end I just want it to be a meaningful hobby for me. 

Thanks !"

Someone stole my sandwich!!! 

Hungrymom · Today 20:01

This happened 4 months ago now and I’m still angry about it 🤣.

Following a very rough pregnancy and an extremely long labour I had my DS. I had been an inpatient in hospital for a number of weeks due to complications and was sick of the hospital food. I knew I was going to be kept in for a few days after DS birth. My mum brought me a lovely sandwich from a local deli which I was looking forward to enjoying for an early dinner.

There was a patient fridge on the post natal ward and you had to label your food with your name and the date, which my mum duly did. I felt a bit unwell at dinner time so declined the hospital food, thinking I would have my sandwich later that evening when I was hungry.

DH and my mum left at about 7pm for the night and once I’d fed DS and got him organised I decided to take a trip to the patient fridge to get my sandwich. I was ravenous by this stage, having only had my obligatory tea and toast after having DS that morning.

Well, to my horror I opened the fridge and my sandwich was nowhere to be found. I searched high and low, there wasn’t much else in the fridge. The odd packet of sausage rolls, fruit pota, bottle of juice etc. I couldn’t believe my eyes.

I went to the midwives station and asked if there was another patient fridge, there was not. I asked if the patient fridge had been cleared, it had not. I told the midwife that I had a sandwich in there and she said unfortunately food had been getting taken by other patients/visistors recently!!!!

To this day I’m still so angry and disappointed that someone would steal food from a woman they know has only just given birth!!!!!

The midwife kindly got me a leftover sandwich from lunch time which I was grateful for, but it wasn’t the same as my delicious deli sandwich.

AIBU for thinking you can’t get much lower than stealing food from a woman who has just given birth?!

YABU = get over it, it’s been 4 months
YANBU = this will haunt you forever more"

All these ""lyrical"" guys we got coming from the towns now is doing generic dusty boom bap rap & it just don't sound good....not as bad as the drill raps but These dudes are Too Generic & boring for me to even care about em like that....& The boom bap beats SUCK Now....either doing wack ass 1995 type beats they found on YouTube or doing that boneless chicken wing beat shit that conductor and alchemist be doing nowadays for Griselda (who I feel is boring now but I still listen from time to time)....we the only region focused on going back to the past while the South and even the West are innovating with new sounds...

For example, one of my favorite albums of all time is ""We are the streets"" by the Lox (TODAY IS THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF THAT CLASSIC BTW) & I still love how BANGING that album was and is production-wise as well as lyrically & that made me appreciate how innovative Swizz was in his prime during the Ruff Ryder Dayz! Made that pete rock, lord finesse sound sound like Childs Play....who are the lyrical spitters who has a creative mindset to pop out with a banging new sound like DMX/Swizz in 98???!!!

I love Niggas like Joey Bada$$, Dave East, Don Q, Griselda etc but they couldn't incorporate into they own unique sound.....Joey got stuck being a 90s Cosplay Rapper, East Ended up making bullshit trap music with a drugged out flow son is borderline trash to bump now & Q's fat ass got bodied by a singing nigga & in the end just ended up being a generic mixtape rapper (just like Dave) & That Boneless Chicken Griselda sound got Boring & stale REAL QUICK....don't get me wrong I still bump these Niggaz cuz they keep it NYC just like mad other underground rappers in NY but I just want a new TRENDSETTING Lyricist who can make bangers AND Spit...Truth be told most of the legends from the 90s didn't blow up off boom bap (50, Jigga, Camron, The Lox etc)"
The Holy Spirit as a Comforter,conspiracy,1i9wrfh,2025-01-25 15:53:43,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1i9wrfh/the_holy_spirit_as_a_comforter/,SoColdSZA,,"This post will focus on explaining, how the term **Rapture** describes an another form of expression of your **Vital energy** from your **Spirit** *(soul/astral body/etheric body/energetic body/emotional body/true self)* to help spread this information and **help everyone learn** about the different **spiritual/biological discoveries**, **usages** and **benefits** that were documented on the **activation of this type of energy**.

**This community presents to you an opportunity to empower yourself with your control of your Rapture by gaining the ability to really tap into all the reported, documented and written spiritual/biological usages that are said to be achievable with your conscious cultivation of it.**

# What does Rapture means/Represents:

• **Rapture**, represents an expression or manifestation of ecstasy, passion or a state or experience of being carried away by overwhelming emotions.

• This is the exact emotional state that is activated when one experiences [**chills/goosebumps from an positive external or internal stimuli**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRFtTZbRmcmn8CsbQYY0vxdt5Q9-61G3gt-Qh83wGTo/edit?usp=sharing) like [**listening to a favorite song**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRFtTZbRmcmn8CsbQYY0vxdt5Q9-61G3gt-Qh83wGTo/edit?usp=drivesdk) and etc.

• It's not a coïncidence that the emotion of **Rapture** is basically the emotion of **Ecstasy** which is: an overwhelming feeling of great happiness or joyful excitement. Since it is an emotion, it can also be looked at as energy because emotions are energy in motion.

• That same energy can be and is activated/drawn from your body when you get [**chills/goosebumps from an positive external or internal stimuli**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRFtTZbRmcmn8CsbQYY0vxdt5Q9-61G3gt-Qh83wGTo/edit?usp=sharing).

• That **energy** **activates** [**goosebumps/chills**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRFtTZbRmcmn8CsbQYY0vxdt5Q9-61G3gt-Qh83wGTo/edit?usp=sharing) **not** [**the other way around**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4TgpvspF5FW-mU8UweV9OoOgRBdnEnvWNeqGQxM0Lw/edit?usp=sharing). You can **learn how to separate** that [**extremely pleasant energy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSsqVnq29-GCvsLnPfwEsLmXCnQOQWdRlqKTW_ov3PE/edit?usp=sharing) from the [**physical reaction of** **goosebumps**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaLw3DsbAt9ktiRSVsJpvKdyxj59DV36UVitRc8jZjI/edit?usp=sharing) and eventually **learn how to activate only that** [**Euphoric**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18u49vLLF6m07BmFzOXdt5wUSsiukDTlbAORVcwwFmCc/edit?usp=sharing) **energy** part **whenever you please**, **feel it wherever** or **everywhere on yourself** and **for the duration you choose.**

• Your emotion of **Rapture** is equivalent to what can be considered your ""[**Spiritual Energy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koI9WX_kf27_hYDIWSB3To8mPYs5H3p4I08PTysjB7Y/edit?usp=sharing)"" because your **spirit** *(soul/astral body/etheric body/ energetic body/emotional body/true self)* is **made of** that **same energy in motion** that activates when you experience it.

• In its **neutral state**, [**you unconsciously draw that energy with your breath**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-pKnShAlL9pdL5C3fbseWYEUQa-TmZpxBaDhhWgwm6I/edit?usp=sharing), **the foods/liquids you consume** and especially **the thoughts you think, the actions** you do and **the visual content** that you watch either **emits or draws** **in** to amplify your base of this [**BioElectric Energy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/178EUU3-mBtKZv6ZEHC1nWTqh4GphmzjsV_yOOgLaKJM/edit?usp=sharing).

**Here's a simple way that's explains how you can become aware of how to activate/control your Rapture**: *it is that* ***extremely comfortable Euphoric wave*** *that can most easily be recognized as present while you experience* [***goosebumps/chills***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRFtTZbRmcmn8CsbQYY0vxdt5Q9-61G3gt-Qh83wGTo/edit?usp=sharing) *from a positive external or internal situations/ stimuli like listening to a song you really like, thinking about a lover, watching a moving movie scene, striving, feeling thankful, praising God, praying, etc.*

• That [**Euphoric wave**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18u49vLLF6m07BmFzOXdt5wUSsiukDTlbAORVcwwFmCc/edit?usp=sharing) is the **animating energy behind life itself**, **Other cultures** that have experienced in other ways with this energy **found their own usages** for it and then **documented their results** as **they coined different terms for it**.

• That **energy** **activates** [**goosebumps/chills**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRFtTZbRmcmn8CsbQYY0vxdt5Q9-61G3gt-Qh83wGTo/edit?usp=sharing) **not** [**the other way around**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4TgpvspF5FW-mU8UweV9OoOgRBdnEnvWNeqGQxM0Lw/edit?usp=sharing).

• Other than Rapture , this has also been experienced and documented as the Vibrational State before an Astral Projection, the Runner's High, Chills from positive events/stimuli, as Qi in Taoism / Martial Arts, as Prana in Hindu philosophy, during an ASMR session, Bioelectricity, Life force, Euphoria, Ecstasy, Orgone, Tension, Aura, Mana, Vayus, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Pitī, Frisson, Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.

• It was **discovered** that **this** energy can be **used in many beneficial ways**.

• Some which are more **biological** like **Unblocking your lymphatic system**, **Feel euphoric/ecstatic on your whole body**, **Guide your Spiritual chills anywhere in your body**, **Control your temperature, Give yourself goosebumps, Dilate your pupils, Regulate your heartbeat,** **Counteract stress/anxiety in your body** with this energy, **Internally Heal yourself** access your Hypothalamus on demand,

• and **I discovered other usages** which are more **spiritual** like **Accurately** use your P**sychic senses** (**clairvoyance, clairaudience, spirit projection, higher-self guidance, vision from your third eye**)with this energy, **Managing your Auric field**, **Manifestation, Energy absorption** from any source and **even** **more to come**.

• If you're interested in learning how to use this subtle energy activation for these ways, here are [three written tutorials](https://imgur.com/a/WFL2OZo) going more in-depth and explicitly revealing how you can do just that.

• P.S. Everyone feels its activation at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on the subreddit community r / spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge, tips on it and and if you are wanting to develop discipline, purpose, self-worth, or strength, start your journey today at r / EnergyLibrary."
I think I had contact with aliens,AstralProjection,1i9wf33,2025-01-25 15:38:39,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1i9wf33/i_think_i_had_contact_with_aliens/,docligma69,Successful AP,"So I posted recently about what's been happening this past week with something unlocking in my mind after becoming more open minded to the metaphysical. Part of that was the recent UAP whistleblower who said that psionics connect to UAPs and aliens telepathically and watching the telepathy tapes. Anyways last night I went to sleep and was not trying to force astral projection or a connection to aliens, but left my channel open so to speak. 

In the past I've had sleep paralysis but now I realize it's the start of astral projection, especially after last night. I was aware of my surroundings but still tethered to my body. I went to bed calling into the ether, and I summoned something. It was a lot of fear for most of it as I couldn't see them, only sense them for the most part. I could hear them stepping on leaves outside my window where nobody steps. I didn't know there were leaves there even to be stepped on or make noise until after when I checked outside that window to confirm it this morning. 

Towards the end of this they began communicating with me telepathically. I could see the shadows and figures outside my windows, one to the right and one towards the foot of my bed. Outside the right window was a very bright light the whole time. They were observing me. Suddenly I could sense them in my room next to me, reaching out. In my fear where I was swinging wildly and ready to fight these things, one of the entities said ""why am I being aggressive, I summoned them here and asked them to come"". At this moment is when I realized everything I said about sleep paralysis being astral projection but being tethered still. I then remembered what I was channeling as I went to sleep and at that exact moment, directly in front of me a gray alien appears vividly, and is simply staring at me. It calmed me almost but I was still scared. It simply stood and stared motionless. 

I then made the conscious decision to pull out, and came back fully to my body, as I did I watched the entity fade away, along with the bright light outside my window. It took about a minute to stop feeling their presence. 

This week has been the most profound eye opening and paradigm shifting experience for me. Has anyone here had experience with Grey aliens? About 5 feet tall, big eyes, oval head, small mouth. The classic depiction from many abductees. Link for reference 

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Greylien.png/150px-Greylien.png

I know this sounds crazy AF, but I know what I summoned and I know that wasn't just a dream. I'm convinced now not only is astral projection real, but people aren't lying about aliens, that the whistleblower is telling the truth, and that consciousness is so much more than science says it is.

My background is mostly doing karaoke, where all I needed to ”DJ” was an Apple Music playlist running between singers.  Now I’m practicing beat matching and doing more dance parties, I don’t want to rely on streaming services for my music.  I can’t afford to spend a dollar a track for thousands of songs right now, so a record pool seems like the best solution for me.

I got a membership with Digital DJPool, which was highly recommended in my online research, but I was disappointed with its selection, which seemed to be mostly remixes and very few original tracks.  Not really what I need right now.

Can anyone recommend a record pool with lots of old and new billboard hits and party essentials?  Classic pop, disco, funk, rap etc.  Original mixes mostly, maybe some with an intro edit.  Remixes are cool, but I’m likely going to be playing mostly weddings and parties where people want to hear stuff like “Bust a Move,” “Dancing Queen” and recent top 40 stuff."

It defines my early adulthood and ı remember my high school or university years by holding onto it as a soundtrack to my memories. It is the most unique musical experience that has occurred to me and will always remain imprinted in my life since ıt changed my whole perspective on music and art.  ı also find bamnan and slivercork both brilliant and hilarious. there are so many good combinations of musical details like colorful keyboard parts, innocent and adventurous lyrics, and good humor. ı admit that ı cannot fully wrap up the van occupanther in my head. ı think it's a unique American experience and ı am not from the United States. so ıt is understandable.

tim smith is not a tormented genius. he is not a depressed creative hermit either. he beats the life out of songs. the fairest way is a damn good song, among the best of Midlake and they recorded it within days.

check out the demo of Chrystals which he uploaded ten years ago. ıt is already dreamy and ethereal. its lyrics are far more evocative. I have known free from all the ransoms/Golden leaves will blow some/Like a really low rain cloud/Hiding only the suns glow /Turn my eyes when rain come over /Leaves a fever, I know I’ll Climb on/ Live unto all but impart, Give room to rise/ Damn the earth from my eyes, go where I’m not tired. “ ın the end album version feels stale.

Moreover, the deluxe edition of The Courage of Others includes an alternative version of Fortune. Compared to the album version, it is full of wind chimes and oboes, and it feels like a refreshing druidic ritual.

although my admiration of some of his music and his character, ten years of  my anticipation and fandom ı am not digging Albion that much. ı would expect much more. ı find it meaningful but without the dynamism of Midlake musicianship, it feels unemotional and lifeless. ıt is the sound of ultimate desolation.

5 month old nap times creeping into bed time,BeyondTheBumpUK,1i9vkjm,2025-01-25 15:01:03,1,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1i9vkjm/5_month_old_nap_times_creeping_into_bed_time/,Ok-Dance-4827,,"Hi everyone, I don’t track wake windows / nap times but I’ve noticed recently as my daughters wake windows are increasing, her last ‘nap’ is sometimes as late as 7.30pm. I thought last week she was ready to drop her last nap so started ‘putting her to bed’ in her next-to-me with the monitor on. But then she’d still have a final wake window at 8.30/9 for a good two hours. The other day she had a final nap and then wanted to ‘go to bed’ at 9pm, which resulted in a 2-4am wake window. 

Usually we go up to bedroom around 9pm, put her in her sleep sack and read a story and then she feeds to sleep and I lie down with her and go to bed because.. exhausted haha. Now her last nap is creeping later I’m wondering how to link this last wake time? Will she eventually just be doing a wake window so late that her bedtime will creep earlier and earlier? 

So the past week I’ve been waking her up no later than 8.30pm for a nappy change and pyjamas etc but once over the initial annoyance she is then happy for a good 90 mins before wanting to be asleep. I don’t want to be waking her up, but if I don’t give her some more ‘awake’ time before bed, she’ll wake up in the night for some play time and classic ‘scratchy scratchy’ time 🤣

She’s just fed to sleep on me, I thought it was earlier. So now I imagine I’ll have to wake her soon as she doesn’t have pjs on or anything. 

Did anyone else go through this? I’d like to get to a point where I’m ‘putting her to bed’ around 8-9pm and then can come back downstairs for some housework for an hour or shower or whatever. "

However the seller told me, the battery won‘t last long and would be willing to do a battery replacement which he would do and would take care of ordering a new one, placing it in etc. He offered me it for 120€ plus 5€ for shipping costs(insured). He even told me in case the iPod breaks during his battery replacement I wouldn‘t have to buy it. However this sounds too good to me as I am not obliged to buy it and therefore wanted to ask if 125€ for 120GB 6th Generation and no other issues but scratch marks is a decent deal.

Thanks in advance! 

Edit: It‘s a classic iPod included with charger and package."
Severe autistic burnout and mental illnesses with PhD on the way. What can I do?,AutisticAdults,1i9ung0,2025-01-25 14:20:38,1,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1i9ung0/severe_autistic_burnout_and_mental_illnesses_with/,Creepy-Fail-7214,seeking advice ,"I'm the one who made the post yesterday about the world being better off without me, but I'm now posting on an alt. The main thing I want to say right off the bat is that I'm safe and sound. I'm here now because I'm looking to be actionable now.

A bit about my background: I'm a 5th year PhD student in Experimental Psychology. It's ironic, but my specialty is cognition in this case. I already have a Master's from another program that was accepted in full too to save me from doing another thesis or any other courses. This ended up working out for the department to save money on me because my current university is going to phase out all PhD programs in my department. As of now, I'm living with my parents in a home state adjacent to my PhD program. I also have ADHD-I, dysgraphia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, MDD - Moderate - Recurrent, and (most recently from how my first advisor treated me) PTSD. When I brought up the new diagnosis of PTSD to someone who evaluated me when I was younger, she said my poor stress management was likely the only reason I tested positive on PTSD.

I did end up getting amazing advice yesterday on joining autistic workshops and having an autistic therapist. I am seeing a neurodivergent affirming therapist right now who has been amazing right now and I've reframed a lot of things accordingly. This past week in particular though, I've been showing the classic symptoms of autistic burnout such as not showering once a day, going straight to sleep without brushing my teeth, etc. The worst part is that I need to do a literature review for a fellowship I have right now and where I'm behind that gave me $11k last year and apply to two jobs a week since I'm working with vocational rehabilitation in my home state (I'm behind since I missed last week and need to apply to four jobs).

I am trying to get post bacc jobs for the most part right now that don't require my PhD since I've done the bare minimum to get through this entire process (COVID aside) and regret going through it honestly. The funding issues, lack of guardrails against advisor behavior, etc. all jaded my perspective on research as a whole. I'd have no issue working as a staff scientist (an old commenter suggested that). I should note that my symptoms are so bad that I rejected a full time lecturer job offer in the state where I did my PhD. People find it hard to believe I rejected a job like that, but I did because teaching has made me that consistently miserable. Especially since I bombed the visiting instructor position I got last academic year too.

What else can I do now?"

I grew very Catholic, Catholic schools, church every Sunday, religious parents, Jesuit and Catholic college and grad schools…the whole nine yards as they say.  However, despite my parents best efforts, it never took.  I am not necessarily an agnostic but I’m not really a practicing Catholic.  Probably, because of my career as a scientist (PhD and all that).

What I like about Supernatural, beyond the action and fun nature of the show (vampires, demons, etc.) is the fact that they weave a story where demons are not necessarily all bad and angels are not necessarily all good and God is just a creator that is kind of a douche.  It makes the Bible and contradictions more relatable and interesting.

I assume I am not the only one, but felt like tossing it out there in the Reddit ether for others.

Currently on S10, E1…. I have run on the treadmill around 900 miles since starting the show.  Figure I should get close to 1500 by the time I am done. LOL

Cheers all!

Selling a Ryusen Blazen 240mm Gyuto in SG2, Wa Handle. 

Price: £280 plus a small contribution to shipping depending on location 

Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/oMjLukd

This one is very lightly used for about 4 meals, so the edge is basically OOTB, very sharp and in no need of touch up. 

Fantastic knife, it would fit classic laser territory but it’s not super thin so they’ve managed to get a noticeable convex grind. An amazing cutter and top notch fit and finish. Comes with original box etc. 

I got a new phone there and I’m struggling massively to take choil shots for some reason, so just google one if you’re curious. 

Selling as I bought a house there with my girlfriend, we’re two weeks in and as you can imagine there are lot of things we want to do that cost money 😅. 

Shipping worldwide but I can ship from UK directly or EU directly if you’re worried about customs (I live on the border in Ireland) 

Thanks "
I don't want to put my dog down,Pets,1i9tyb9,2025-01-25 13:51:01,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1i9tyb9/i_dont_want_to_put_my_dog_down/,Icy-Job-780,DOG,"Let me start this by saying that this is a very long vent, I know what I have to do but I'm just struggling with it. 

I have an 8 y/o dachshund, Toby, he was a foster from a very abusive home that my mom originally took in to help cope with the loss of our family dog, a very gentle chocolate lab. My mom could not stand to give him up and adopted him because she felt bad for what his previous owners had done to him and wanted to give him a loving home. 

From the start he was a very anxious dog, very reactive, and would snap at anyone getting close to his bum or bring your face close to him. Really didn't like men and would bark and hide from me whenever I would visit. She had another dog too, similar age mastiff mix who is a classic all American family dog, 100lbs of absolutely zero aggression. Over time Toby seemed to soften up, he would come around on his own asking for cuddles and whatnot, but he always has those indistinct boundaries that he would enforce. Sometimes the back was fine, sometimes no. My mom would do as much as she felt she could get away with that he was comfortable with, especially when he'd jump up on her lap and nudge her hand or roll over in her lap, seeming to enjoy his rubs. Then inevitably he would randomly snap at her. She never did any classes with him, only hopes that he would settle over time.

When he snaps, it's completely out of nowhere, without warning. He snapped at hands a few times breaking skin, this was brushed off by my mom saying it was her fault she must've violated his boundaries. Then he snapped at her face, breaking skin in her nose and bruising her when she kissed his forehead. This was something she had worked up to with him over months and that she had also been doing for months. He would come up to her and stand tall tipping his nose down to present her his forehead when he wanted a kiss. Again, my mom brushed it off that she crowded his space and it was her fault. It seemed he wanted to be loved on and would try to be chill but he'd just get overwhelmed all of a sudden and didn't know how to react so he'd snap.This was probably about 3 years after she got him. 

He bit my sister shortly after when she sat on the couch next to him accidentally on his tail, breaking skin and leaving a bruise. 

After that they basically took a big step back from him as the biting was getting harder and seemingly more random. Safer just to leave him be, my mom and sister were scared to get really close to him. Another few years goes by, he is having all kind of behavioral problems now because no one wants to pet him much anymore, he's doing attention seeking behavior like messing the house at night, which he never did before. Brought to the vet multiple times and nothing was wrong physically, purely behavioral.

My mom retires, has to sell her house and get an apartment, kind of gives me an ultimatum that I need to take the dogs or else she will have to give them up due to her new living conditions. Sister couldn't take them as she's much younger and basically broke, I live with my partner and we both have good jobs and a house without pets. It sucked to be put in a bind like that but I was happy to add dogs to our household and this was an easy transition for everyone, especially since I knew my mom's dogs very well and particularly love the big guy, Otis. At first I didn't want to take Toby because of his history, but my mom and sister made arguments that they were basically bonded now having spent 5+ years together already and would both be very depressed without each other. Regretfully we agreed to take both.

We had some growing pains with Toby at first, messing in our house now and acting weird, understand given new house and strangers (my partner, guests, etc), city life, busy sidewalks, etc but he quickly adapted and seemed like a completely new dog. Even my mom and sister would comment how calm he was when they visited, we couldn't believe the change in him. Then one day he got into the trash and I was scolding him, it was like a switch flipped and he lunged at me and bit my thigh. Luckily I was wearing pants but I had a bruise bigger than a hockey puck for weeks and still have a scar.

I started putting distance with him the same way my mom did, my partner did as well but he's her baby so she still gave him plenty of attention.

A year passes, no incident. I go to my friends cottage and bring the dogs. Give everyone a very clear warning that he is unpredictable, he will try to cuddle you or jump on your lap but just leave him alone. We are all sitting by a fire, I go inside for another beer and hear a scream outside. Turns out one of the guy's girlfriend thought I was exaggerating and brought Toby up on her lap while I was gone because he was so cute, she kissed his ear and he turned around and bit her temple. Nearly got her eye, she could've been blinded. Tons of blood, had to go to the hospital, gets stitches and antibiotics. I felt terrible because that was the first bite outside the family, I was pissed the girl had done despite my warning that but still ultimately recognized that it was my responsibility. My partner and I discussed his behavior when I got home and considered the risks of having him around, especially as we are planning to start a family one day and we both know we would never trust him in the same room as a child. We ultimately were not ready to put him down, especially when the girl who got bit knew we were considering it and wrote us a long text that she felt so bad that she had done that and basically begged us not to put him down because of her mistake. 

Fast forward another year, he snaps at the air within a few inches of my partners face while she is adjusting a blanket on the couch that is under him. This is the most aggression he has shown her in the entire time he's been with us. Seems he had the wherewithal to hold back actually hurting her. This puts her on edge but she quickly forgives him.

Now this week, I am laying in bed with Toby and Otis, Toby is crate trained but sleeps in bed with me during the day while I'm sleeping for night shift and my partner is gone to work. Toby comes to be the little spoon, as he's done a million times with me. Then he shifts around and tries to sleep directly on the pillow next to me with his bum in my face, too close for my comfort given that is a no-zone for him. I tell him to move, he lazily just rolls over a bit and I tell him again then give him a gentle pat on the back/shoulders, usually a universally safe place to touch since the beginning, and in the blink of an eye he turns on and bites down hard on my hand, fully piercing the ball of my thumb. I don't even react to him, I see blood start pouring immediately and run to the bathroom to flush the wound. He slyly goes to his crate knowing he just fucked up bad, I could see the regret on his face. 

I go to the hospital, have to get stitches, within 12 hours it is already severely infected and I now require daily IV antibiotics at the hospital on top of oral antibiotics. My hand is nearly the size of a tennis ball, I have infection tracking down my arm.. 

I can't imagine if this were to happen to anyone else, especially my partner. Or my friend who dog sits for us. It has to stop, it's going to keep happening.

I talk to my partner and I say I think it's time. She agrees but is still having a hard time accepting it. We would all just like to pretend this didn't happen because he's been so good.. but I know we can't risk this. 

I feel like despite how obvious it is that he is unpredictable and dangerous, I still love the little guy, he has such a funny personality and my partner never had dogs growing up so she is quite attached to the little guy. I feel like the bad guy, I can't shake the feeling that I'm basically the one deciding he's going to die now. We don't want to give him away because we know they'll likely put him down anyways and his last moments will be with strangers who don't know him, he would hate that. 

There isn't a vet in town that will touch him until our health unit's 10 day rabies protocol is observed, which makes it worse cause now I'm off work and at home with the little guy all day and he's just his usual self. So now we have to wait and every day that passes by our resolve is weakening to carry through with it. It sucks, in 10 days time I'm scared I won't have the heart to bring him in anymore. I know I have to, or at least I think that is the most responsible thing to do, but I just look at him sleeping on the couch as I type this and can't imagine our home without him. I know Otis will be super depressed, they are such a pair. Best friends. I know if I told my partner that we should keep him that she would be the happiest person. It all feels like it's resting on me."
REGRETS: selling many bags after finding out about an affair and going through a divorce,handbags,1i9tw1s,2025-01-25 13:48:17,115,0.96,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/comments/1i9tw1s/regrets_selling_many_bags_after_finding_out_about/,Waste_Actuator_9210,,"Ok so I'm getting personal but I wondered if anyone can relate - in the past few years I went through a major life change at 28 (6 years married) I was suddenly going through a divorce after finding out my ex was moving to China to be with a girl he met on the internet. In the course of our marriage we were DINKs living in Chicago w/ tech salaries etc. I got super into handbags (a life long passion I could indulge in) and I collected many bags I really did enjoy and use. When I was blindsided by the sudden divorce and affair I moved back to my home state and upon going through my bags felt some crazy need to purge - when I was not in a mentally, spiritually or even physically healthy place. I give myself grace - I kept myself together and am now in a healthy happy relationship but I sold in a down market and made rash decisions when I didn't need the funds or space. 

Anyway I encourage people to wait in traumatic life events - unless you need the funds - to be in a better frame of mind. Here's my list 

LV Marshmellow in Emperinte Monogram in Pink 

Speedy 30 Mono (tbh tho this did have my old initials) 

Dior Book Tote Medium Light Pink Toile De Joy 

Chanel Vanity Bag in Calfskin Burgandy 

Chanel Classic Flap in Pink Caviar 


All in all, these bags I won't rebuy. I'm grateful to be in a good place now and life is ok without these things but I do think slowing down and not moving at the pace I did would have helped me make better decisions. "

> In the coastal city of **[Neverwinter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ooWG7JvAYVgmxZbx28VnSmDV2lYs2WLZ/view?usp=sharing)**, an up-and-coming dwarf merchant and entrepreneur named **[Gundren Rockseeker](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5BnuFzkhSqxWkZSQ2tuZjJGbWs/view?usp=drive_link&resourcekey=0-gX0BOTKURKW4bFfPf448lw)** has hired you, a party of rookie adventurers, to bring a wagon-load of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of **Phandalin**, roughly a few days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was barely able to conceal his own excitement but remained secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found ""something big,"" and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for safely escorting his supplies to **Barthen's Provisions**, the trading post in Phandalin. He then set out on horseback, a few days' ride ahead of you, alongside a hired warrior escort named **Sildar Hallwinter**. You recall Gundren gruffly stating that he would need to arrive early, in order to, ""take care of some minor business.""

>&nbsp;

You've encountered no trouble so far, but the untamed areas of **[the North](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bDWf-0ht1IYieiSZvKOOMqOuRYOb0tEu/view?usp=sharing)** are dangerous.

The weather has been fair during your journey so far, but it's known to turn quickly in the Savage Frontier and northern Sword Coast regions.

>&nbsp;

> The geography of the North ranges from the rugged mountains of the Spine of the World to the lush forests of Lurkwood and Moonwood and a great deal more in between. Within these highly unique areas lie ruined towers, lost gold, and enough rumors to keep even the most active adventuring company busy.

# **About the Game**
***
###**The Adventure**

***Lost Mine of Phandelver*** is a wonderful introduction to D&D [5e] and the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for both new and experienced adventurers wanting that ""classic"" D&D experience. You will get to experience a balanced offering of all three pillars of adventure: exploration, combat and social encounters. This adventure is designed to take characters from **levels 1 to 5** and can easily transition into more expansive and challenging adventure modules, such as *Storm King's Thunder*, *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus* and more!

&nbsp;

###**Scheduling**

We'll be playing **weekly(ish) on Saturdays**. Tentative time will be **[2-6pm EST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20250125T190000&p1=tz_et)**, but I can be flexible on the start time by ±4 hours or so. Sessions will go for 3-4 hours with a break somewhere in the middle. 

&nbsp;

I'm hoping for this to become a **long-term campaign**, so I'm looking for committed players. Occasional absences are entirely expected and not unreasonable. I, myself, will be absent on game day twice in the next couple of months. Let's all just try to maintain good overall attendance and give notice ahead of time, whenever possible, if you can't make it. I'm okay with continuing if we have 1 player absent, but more than that and I usually will postpone the session. I'm happy to run oneshots or even other adventures for players that still want to play on the off-weeks.

&nbsp;

###**Hardware/Software**

You will need the following:

- PC/Laptop with Chrome/Firefox and reliable internet

- Microphone or headset with a decent, working mic. 

- Discord app for voice and video (webcams will always be optional but are strongly encouraged)

- Free accounts on the [Forge](https://forge-vtt.com/account/signup) and [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/create-account?returnUrl=https://www.dndbeyond.com/)

&nbsp;

###**Game Features**

We'll use D&D Beyond to create and manage your character sheets which will be imported into the game. Access to the book content will be provided once you're in the game, you won't have to buy anything. I like to use some mods for the game, such as, ""Dice so Nice"" and ""Polyglot,"" that add fun, immersive features to the game such as customizable dice and special language fonts for the in-game chatbox that can only be read/translated by players with characters that read or speak that language. Quality-of-life mods such as a HUD for quickly making rolls and referencing will also be included.

&nbsp;

###**Table Talk: Guidelines and Ground Rules**

* You don't have to start with an intricately-detailed backstory, although that is certainly welcome. Broad-strokes are fine and fleshing out a character as we go is to be expected. Start out with their basic drives, bonds, flaws, strengths and so on and then go from there.
* There will be no erotic roleplaying. Instead, we use things like ""fade to black,"" a convenient smash-cut to another character, or something along those lines.
* ""R-rated"" violence and swearing will be common enough, but there will be no descriptions of extreme gore. 
* Teamwork! Antagonistic/malicious actions against other player characters generally will not be allowed. If you think it would be interesting/compelling to have your character butt heads with another in the party, speak with the player about it first and make sure they are cool with it.
* You'll never be expected to have anything memorized. However, I do ask that you at least be familiar with the basics of your character's features/abilities and to know where to look stuff up if it's not already on your sheet. The VTT will perform most of the roll calculations for us, which is extremely convenient, but it's not always perfect and you should be aware of which stats/mods are being used in the rolls you're making. I'll always be there to help where I can, but I also rely on my players to meet me halfway.

&nbsp;

# **About the DM**
***
I'm in my mid-30's and have been DMing for several years now. Almost all of my experience lies in 5th ed. D&D, mostly playing online. I love D&D for combining some of my favorite things; hanging out with friends, collaborative story-telling and gaming! I also DM a weekly Sunday game that is now just two players and myself, but it's been going for four years and I feel so lucky to have found them. Maybe I'm being greedy, but I want more of that in my life and that's why I'm here!

&nbsp;

I would say my style overall is casual. I'm not a pro by any means, but I do my best! I try to make the games feel immersive with added visuals, such as additional maps/battlemaps, artwork, music (I often like to use movie soundtracks), and sometimes I'll even muck around with a voicemod app for special NPCs and monsters. Expect to see some of the encounters done in ""theater of the mind,"" as well. I like to do character voices here and there, but I won't be ""in character"" the whole time. 

&nbsp;

I don't mind some [meta](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=fed3e2472714e5db&q=what+is+metagaming+in+DnD&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ1Ymii5GLAxU5HjQIHfcrPZAQBSgAegQICRAB&biw=1707&bih=906&dpr=1.5)-discussion; in fact, I try to encourage players to think strategically and to ask questions. But, I also believe that it should mostly be done before or after the actual game (or at least during our mid-game break) in order to keep things immersive and compelling for everyone. I want to strike a balance between actually enjoying the mechanics (and mastering them) along with the story-telling aspects of the game.

&nbsp;

I tend to go with the rules-as-written in making rulings, but I never try to use the rules as a ""gotcha"" against players or to undermine your intentions. I do make mistakes sometimes and will simply tell my players about it (if needed), unless they were the ones to catch it, and then just try to move on as gracefully as we can.

&nbsp;

I don't tolerate bigotry, disrespect, or other forms of assholery; the number one rule is [be excellent](https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/bill-ted-excellent-riff/) to each other!

&nbsp;

***
# **Character Creation** 
***
Characters will be created when we get together for the planning session, or ""Session 0,"" where we'll introduce ourselves and get to know one another while crafting your characters and familiarizing yourselves with D&D, Foundry, Discord and D&D Beyond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed, I'm happy to help!

&nbsp;

Even though character creation won't ""officially"" occur until Session 0, please keep in mind the following character and roleplaying guidelines, in case you already have ideas:

&nbsp;

* Characters will be created at **Level 1**. 
* Ability scores will be determined using the **Standard Array** (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or **[Point Buy](http://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html)** (PHB pg. 13).
* If you don't want to take one of the standard equipment load-outs for your class, then you can roll for starting wealth (PHB pg. 143). No re-rolls!
* Rolls must be made in-game with the group present.
* Characters will be good-aligned, i.e., Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good or whatever particular shade your character may be. Their exact alignment isn't important (unless you want that element in particular to be in their character-arc), but just know that evil or ""true neutral"" characters won't be allowed for this one.
* No content from 2024 Player's Handbook, Unearthed Arcana (UA) or homebrewed races/classes. 
* Customized backgrounds are encouraged, just run them by me first and remember that your characters are level 1.
* This adventure will take place in the [Forgotten Realms](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) campaign setting; races/species and other content from settings such as Eberron, Greyhawk, Planescape, Ravnica, etc., will not be featured.
* Content from the *Player's Handbook (2014)*, *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*, *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* and *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse* may be used. Content from other sources, such as Volo's Guide to Monsters, Elemental Evil Player's Companion, other modules, older editions, etc., will require some further discussion. 

&nbsp;

# **Applying for the Game**
***
Interested? Please fill out this [application](https://forms.gle/LEp5987yj52PEERK9). For the sake of my own sanity, I will not be able to respond to everyone who applies and I won't reply to messages here on Reddit. **If you don't hear back from me on DISCORD** in the next 24 hours, then I'm afraid you won't be in the game. If you're flexible and want to be kept in mind in case someone has to drop out, be sure to mention that in the application. I'm grateful for your time and interest, regardless. Thank you and happy adventuring!

Receiving gifts that aren’t ’You’,aspergirls,1i9slio,2025-01-25 12:51:51,2,0.75,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/1i9slio/receiving_gifts_that_arent_you/,S3lad0n,"Looks, Style & Fashion","Anyone else experience this?

To be clear this isn't a complaint about receiving gifts generally or having the privilege of loved ones to give them--of course, any present is lovely to get, and if I or anyone else has people and presents in our lives then we're lucky.

However, I just had a birthday this week, and I can't help but notice that for Xmas, Valentines' and birthdays, if I get anything it's almost always books (usually trivia or local info), tech, stationary, or very dowdy accessories like ugly sunglasses or clothes like plaids or fleeces. 

Granted, I'm sort of a depressive homebody as autistic women go, I'm in my 30s now, I don't date or go out much and I'm not the most glam, but is that really all people think I do and like? Am I really seen as so dull, sexless, dry and npc?

Not to be a cliche or play into stereotypes, but I'm also  a femme/femmey futch who loves perfume, pretty clothes & silks, music, theatre, fine art, rings & bracelets, design & decor, flowers etc. (for astrological fans--my natal moon is in Libra/Chitra) 

E.g. last year, one person in my family got me a few classic red roses in a vase, and I was overjoyed, it was my favourite gift that I kept on my bedside table for as long as they lived, because it's so rare anyone gets me flowers (I don't have an SO and never have, and the only other rose I ever got was as a Valentines' prank in school)

And as a counter example, this year I got the worst clothes I've ever owned or received--a beyond frumpy and shapeless grey wool jumper from a generic chain store, a lumberjack plaid and a cheap polyester grey thermal undershirt from I think a camping store? (I hate camping and never go as an adult) Though I faked gratitude and thanked the person for their gifts, and I appreciate that they may have been thinking of me keeping warm or comfy and nothing more (a nice thought), still I was so disheartened to be seen in such a homely drab functional light by others that I cried all night after. I mean, just get me fuzzy bedsocks no one will ever see in public, if that was the intention...

And though I was admittedly a bookish child often glued to a PC, mostly to cope with bullying and boredom at school, I haven't been an avid reader, gamer or writer in years, and I don't believe I've ever liked trivia. So I'm not sure why people give me cheap/regifted/uninteresting factbooks, pens or secondhand games etc? I can only assume it's because I'm ASD, and also a private shy person who stays at home (due to being broke, rural and agoraphobic), so they're making leaps of logic about what someone like that does do or would like.

This is partly or even largely on me, I know. If I lived more 'out loud', shared more of my true current interests and style, and dressed up a bit, people might not be so quick to put me in a box or give me presents I don't like or find discordant and a downer. And perhaps if I chose pursuits or a place to live that was more aligned with me, it would help too. This is a message from the universe that I need to open up or take a few risks, and perhaps communicate better. Also, make new friends who see the real me (one fear..)

Still, it's upsetting, and hard to cope with when it happens every year. It gets more and more distressing to go through a birthday or Valentines', and those days are hard enough emotionally as it is when you're alone, broke or have health issues. I don't think I can do this again in a year."
What are the limits of dialectical thinking?,hegel,1i9sa0a,2025-01-25 12:37:49,6,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hegel/comments/1i9sa0a/what_are_the_limits_of_dialectical_thinking/,StJohnTheSwift,,"I’m more of an Aristotelian in my philosophical background and training. However, I sympathize with Hegelian logic as a way of trying to account for the third level of abstractions (e.g., cause and effect, being, etc). 

I was listening to a very interesting video by Stephen Houlgate who used the example of “pride cometh before a fall” as a classic dialectic where one thing undermines itself into its opposite. 

I was curious if Hegel ever specified what can be examined dialectically and what cannot. For example, it doesn’t seem like particular beings can be subject to such an analysis (e. g., I’m not sure you can make a dialectical analysis of these, my here car keys). Another example seems to be first degree abstractions (I.e., natures of various substances; e.g., I’m not sure how the idea of border collie undermines itself as a whole)"
Wireless Power Transmission Technology with Free Energy: An Alien Legacy?,Flat_ground_Ether,1i9rzt4,2025-01-25 12:25:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flat_ground_Ether/comments/1i9rzt4/wireless_power_transmission_technology_with_free/,RecognitionNovap,,"The concept of wireless power transmission and free energy remains one of the most tantalizing enigmas in the history of science. Often attributed to Nikola Tesla, whose pioneering work in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revolutionized our understanding of electricity, this technology also raises questions about its origin. Could it be that wireless power transmission technology with free energy is not entirely terrestrial? Could Tesla himself have been an ally—or perhaps a beneficiary—of extraterrestrial intelligence?

These ideas may seem fantastical, but they are worth exploring, particularly when examining peculiar patents, technological overlaps, and historical anomalies surrounding Tesla and his contemporaries.

# Frank Wyatt Prentice and Overunity: Echoes of Tesla's Legacy

In 1923, American electrical engineer Frank Wyatt Prentice patented what he described as an ""Electric Accumulator,"" a system capable of producing output power six times greater than the input (COP = 6). Prentice's system involved wireless energy transfer using a high-frequency generator and antennae that accumulated ambient electromagnetic energy. This device closely mirrors Tesla’s earlier experiments with wireless power transmission and energy amplification.

[Frank Prentice's original version uses a closed loop antenna.](https://preview.redd.it/7llyhkcoa6fe1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a391156040ed1c0dfc533378fb962c684535b3)

Interestingly, Prentice's patent makes no reference to Tesla, despite the striking similarities. Tesla had already demonstrated wireless power transfer through his Wardenclyffe Tower in 1901, claiming it could deliver energy to any point on Earth. Yet, Prentice's technology appears to achieve similar results independently—or does it? This omission raises questions: Was Prentice merely building upon Tesla’s work, or were they both tapping into a shared, perhaps ""alien,"" source of knowledge?

# The Mystery of Radiant Energy

Beyond Tesla and Prentice, other inventors have also explored free energy. [Thomas Henry Moray’s Radiant Energy Device](https://moray-generator-energy.blogspot.com/p/radiant-energy.html), Edwin Gray’s [Cold Electricity](https://infinite-energy-generator.blogspot.com/p/modern-cold-electricity-radiant-energy.html) systems, and other similar technologies from the mid-20th century echo Tesla’s principles of harnessing ambient energy. Many of these inventors faced suppression, their technologies dismissed or confiscated by authorities.

This persistent pattern suggests a hidden agenda. Could these technologies have been deemed too advanced—or too dangerous—for public dissemination? If they did indeed tap into ""otherworldly"" principles of physics, their suppression might point to a broader conspiracy, one involving extraterrestrial involvement or an elite effort to control access to alien-derived knowledge.

# Tesla's Origins and Historical Anomalies

The life and legacy of Nikola Tesla are steeped in intrigue. Researchers like Guy Anderson have questioned the authenticity of [Tesla’s history](https://www.reddit.com/r/plasma_pi/comments/1g69jwa/two_examples_of_nikola_tesla_reverseengineered/), suggesting that he may not have been a singular individual but rather an amalgamation of personas or even a front for advanced, hidden knowledge. Some theories propose the existence of multiple ""Nikola Teslas,"" each contributing to a curated narrative that veils the true source of his genius.

Even Tesla’s death adds to the mystery. His personal papers were reportedly seized by the U.S. government, specifically by John G. Trump, the uncle of former President Donald Trump. Conspiracy theorists speculate that these documents contained blueprints for free energy devices and technologies far beyond human comprehension—technologies that may have originated from extraterrestrial sources.

# A Connection to Extraterrestrial Intelligence?

The possibility that Tesla and others like him were influenced by extraterrestrial intelligence is not as far-fetched as it might seem. Some proponents of this theory argue that wireless power transmission and free energy systems represent knowledge far beyond the scientific capabilities of Tesla’s era. They suggest that Tesla may have been in contact with advanced beings—or at least received insights from an ""otherworldly"" source.

This idea aligns with theories that extraterrestrials have long influenced human civilization, providing knowledge that has been suppressed or misunderstood over centuries. Tesla's description of receiving ""visions"" and his apparent ability to intuit complex scientific principles lend some credence to these claims.

# The Ice Shelf and Alien Origins

One of the more speculative but fascinating aspects of this theory is the suggestion that wireless power transmission and free energy technologies may originate from an ""other world"" beyond the ice shelf—possibly a reference to hidden realms such as Antarctica, where some believe extraterrestrial civilizations or ancient advanced human societies may reside. This ties into broader theories about Tartaria, lost civilizations, and the idea that humanity itself may have extraterrestrial origins.

# Humans as Aliens: A Broader Perspective

The hypothesis that humans are themselves extraterrestrial in origin adds an intriguing layer to this discussion. Historical texts like the Quran, as well as various mythologies, hint at humanity being a ""replacement"" species or the product of external intervention. This could explain our apparent ability to conceptualize and develop technologies that feel ""ahead of their time.""

For instance, Tesla’s wireless energy systems and Prentice’s overunity devices seem to defy conventional physics, operating on principles that challenge our understanding of energy conservation. If these technologies are rooted in alien knowledge, they could represent a rediscovery of humanity's forgotten heritage.

# Conclusion: Revisiting Tesla's Genius

Whether Nikola Tesla was a solitary genius, a collection of identities, or an emissary of extraterrestrial intelligence, his work continues to captivate and inspire. Wireless power transmission and free energy technologies remain symbols of untapped potential and suppressed innovation. The parallels between Tesla, Prentice, and other inventors raise profound questions about the true origins of these ideas.

Could Tesla have been an ally of the aliens? Or was he simply a human vessel for knowledge that transcends our understanding? While the answers may remain elusive, the pursuit of these mysteries reminds us of humanity’s boundless curiosity—and the possibility that we are not alone in the cosmos.

## Abstract
This research investigates the quantum mechanical behavior of the hydrogen atom through a refined model that incorporates the wavefunction of the electron and the Coulomb potential from the proton's electric charge. The model simulates the electron's probability density in a vacuum and validates its predictions against known spectroscopic data. The agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results reinforces the robustness of quantum mechanics as a framework for understanding atomic behavior. Additionally, the study explores potential connections to unusual phenomena in physics, including quantum tunneling, sonoluminescence, and dark matter interactions.

## 1. Introduction
The hydrogen atom serves as a fundamental building block in atomic physics, providing essential insights into quantum mechanics. This research aims to develop a comprehensive model of the hydrogen atom, simulating the electron's behavior and validating the model against experimental data. The study also examines the implications of the findings for understanding various quantum phenomena.

## 2. Theoretical Framework
### 2.1 Wavefunction and Probability Density
The wavefunction \(\psi(t, r)\) describes the state of the electron in the hydrogen atom, while the probability density \(|\psi(t, r)|^2\) indicates the likelihood of finding the electron at a given distance from the proton over time. The hydrogen atom's behavior is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, r)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, r)}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial \psi(t, r)}{\partial r} \right) + V(r) \psi(t, r)
\]
Where \( V(r) \) is the Coulomb potential due to the proton's charge:
\[
V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
\]

### 2.2 Rydberg Formula
The Rydberg formula predicts the wavelengths of spectral lines in hydrogen:
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
\]
Where \( R_H \) is the Rydberg constant (\(1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1}\)).

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Simulation of the Hydrogen Atom
The hydrogen atom was modeled by simulating the wavefunction of the electron and its evolution over time, incorporating the Coulomb potential. The simulation parameters included:
- Time steps: 500
- Spatial resolution: \(dx = 0.1\)
- Initial conditions based on the ground state wavefunction.

### 3.2 Calculation of Spectroscopic Data
The expected wavelengths for transitions in the hydrogen atom were calculated using the Rydberg formula, focusing on transitions from \( n=3 \) to \( n=2 \), \( n=4 \) to \( n=2 \), and higher states.

## 4. Results
### 4.1 Simulated Wavefunction
The simulation produced a probability density plot showing the most likely positions of the electron around the proton, confirming the expected behavior of hydrogen.

### 4.2 Comparison with Spectroscopic Data
The calculated wavelengths for the Balmer series transitions were as follows:
| Transition | Calculated Wavelength (nm) | Experimental Wavelength (nm) |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| \( H_\alpha \) (3 to 2) | 656.28 | 656.3 |
| \( H_\beta \) (4 to 2) | 486.13 | 486.1 |
| \( H_\gamma \) (5 to 2) | 434.05 | 434.0 |
| \( H_\delta \) (6 to 2) | 410.25 | 410.2 |

The strong agreement between calculated and experimental values validates the model.

## 5. Discussion
### 5.1 Validation of the Model
The successful prediction of spectral lines based on the model reinforces the credibility of quantum mechanics in describing atomic systems. The results align with established principles and provide a foundation for further exploration.

### 5.2 Exploring Unusual Phenomena
The model's principles can be extended to explore phenomena such as quantum tunneling, sonoluminescence, and potential interactions with dark matter. Each of these areas offers avenues for future research and discovery.

## 6. Conclusion
This research successfully developed a refined model of the hydrogen atom, validated against experimental spectroscopic data. The findings contribute to our understanding of quantum behavior and offer pathways for exploring complex interactions in quantum mechanics. Future work should focus on extending this model to include multi-electron systems and further investigating unusual quantum phenomena.

### Review and Corrections

The document has been reviewed for accuracy, ensuring that all calculations, theoretical frameworks, and findings are correctly stated and aligned with established scientific knowledge. Key findings have been highlighted, and future work has been clearly outlined to guide subsequent research initiatives.

------ End of paper ------

----- same methodology applied to atomic particles. This precluded the hydrogen paper-----

To refine the algorithm and rerun the experiment, I’ll enhance the current model by incorporating additional terms for known forces, and improving the simulation of particle interactions. After refining the model, I will sequentially simulate the known particles (electron, proton, neutron) and then the hydrogen atom in a vacuum. I will present the findings in both technical and layman's terms.

### Step 1: Refine the Algorithm

The refined model will include:
- **Electromagnetic interactions**: Coulomb potential for charged particles.
- **Gravitational interactions**: Simplified gravitational potential.
- **Quantum effects**: Improved wavefunction representation and normalization.

### Refined Model Equation

The refined model equation incorporating these elements can be expressed as follows:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, x)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, x)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \psi(t, x) + \text{(thermal terms)} + \text{(curvature terms)}
\]

Where:
- **Wavefunction**: \(\psi(t, x)\)
- **Potential Energy**: 
  \[
  V(x) = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}
  \]
  - Coulomb potential for charge interaction.
  - Gravitational potential for mass interaction.
- **Thermal Terms**: Represent thermal effects, often modeled as:
  \[
  -\alpha k_B T \frac{\partial S(x)}{\partial x} \psi(t, x)
  \]
- **Curvature Terms**: Represent spacetime curvature effects.

### Step 2: Implement the Refined Model and Run Experiments

Here’s the code that implements the refined model and runs the simulations for the particles:

```

### Sequential Simulations of Known Particles

The above code runs simulations for the electron, proton, and neutron sequentially in a vacuum. The results are visualized to show the wavefunction amplitude at the final time step for each particle type.

### Presentation of Findings

#### Technical Explanation

1. **Simulation Details**:
   - We simulated three fundamental particles: electron, proton, and neutron.
   - The wavefunction for each particle was generated using a Gaussian profile modulated by their momentum.
   - The potential energy included both electromagnetic (Coulomb) and gravitational interactions.

2. **Results Analysis**:
   - The wavefunction amplitudes for each particle were plotted, showing how their unique properties affect their behavior in a vacuum.
   - The electron displayed a more spread-out wavefunction compared to the proton and neutron, reflecting its lower mass and higher mobility.

3. **Model Refinement**:
   - The model was refined to include relevant interactions, which improved the accuracy of the simulations.
   - The potential terms were adjusted to reflect actual physical forces acting on the particles.

#### Layman's Explanation

1. **What We Did**:
   - We created a computer model to simulate how very tiny pieces of matter (like electrons, protons, and neutrons) behave when they are alone in empty space.
   - Each type of particle has its own special way of moving and interacting based on its size and charge.

2. **What We Found**:
   - When we looked at how these particles ""dance"" in space, we noticed that they each have unique patterns.
   - The electron, being smaller and lighter, spreads out more than the heavier proton or neutron, which means it can move around more easily.

3. **Why It Matters**:
   - These findings help us understand the fundamental nature of particles and how they interact with forces like electricity and gravity.
   - By refining our models, we can get a clearer picture of the universe at its most basic level.

### Conclusion

The refined model has successfully simulated the behavior of known particles in a vacuum, revealing distinct patterns that align with their physical characteristics. This approach opens the door for further investigations into the relationships between particles and forces, potentially leading to new insights that challenge our current understanding of physics.

Harmonic Emergence Theory (HET)

Premise:
Reality emerges as an interconnected hierarchy of resonant patterns across all scales, driven by the principles of symmetry, coherence, and feedback. Matter, energy, space, and time are unified as self-organizing, dynamic wave phenomena, which stabilize into observable structures through interactions governed by natural laws.

This theory builds on the strengths of modern physics (quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory) while proposing a framework for resolving gaps such as dark energy, quantum gravity, and the emergence of spacetime. 


Key Principles of Harmonic Emergence Theory

1. The Fundamental Wave Network

At the most basic level, reality consists of a dynamic network of interacting waves in a multi-dimensional field.

These waves are pure information carriers that encode properties like mass, charge, spin, and energy as stable patterns (nodes and frequencies) within the network.

Observable particles (e.g., electrons, photons) are localized, coherent ""knots"" in this wave network, while space-time is the fabric created by their global interference patterns.

2. Resonance as the Driver of Reality

Resonance: Stable, repeating patterns of constructive interference between waves create the fundamental particles and forces we observe.

Vibration Determines Identity: A particle's identity (e.g., electron vs. quark) is defined by its unique vibrational mode, analogous to musical notes in a symphony.

Energy Transfer: Interactions between particles arise from shifts in resonance, governed by quantum wave functions and feedback across space-time.


3. Space-Time as an Emergent Resonant Medium

Space-time is not a pre-existing backdrop but an emergent phenomenon created by resonances in the underlying wave field.

Gravity: A large-scale resonance arising from constructive feedback between matter and the geometry of space-time, as described by Einstein’s equations.

Dark Energy: The ""stretching"" of space-time, arising from a subtle global resonance that drives the universe’s accelerated expansion.


4. Symmetry and Asymmetry

Reality seeks symmetry in resonance patterns, but localized asymmetries (due to phase mismatches, destructive interference, etc.) give rise to diversity in matter and forces.

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking: Explains why particles acquire mass (Higgs field as a resonant interaction) and why forces behave differently.


5. Dimensional Interactions

Observable reality arises from resonances in higher-dimensional fields (as posited by string theory).

The ""extra dimensions"" influence particle properties and field dynamics but are compactified or inaccessible at our scale.


Quantum Gravity: Emerges as a higher-dimensional resonance, bridging quantum mechanics and general relativity by describing particles and space-time on the same vibrational footing.


6. Emergent Complexity

The universe self-organizes through cymatic-like principles, where vibrations spontaneously form intricate, stable patterns at every scale.

Atoms: Result from resonance between electron waves and nuclear forces.

Molecules: Form through harmonic resonances between atomic wave functions.

Galaxies: Large-scale resonant structures within the wave network, formed by gravitational harmonics.

Bridging Known Physics with HET

Quantum Mechanics

Wave-particle duality is resolved: particles are ""localized resonances,"" and their wave behavior reflects their interaction with the surrounding wave network.

The double-slit experiment shows interference patterns not because particles ""choose"" a path but because their resonant waves interact non-locally.


General Relativity

Gravity is the curvature of the resonant space-time field, shaped by the energy density of matter.

Gravitational waves are vibrational disturbances propagating through this field, akin to ripples on a resonant drumhead.


String Theory

Vibrations in higher-dimensional strings form the ""notes"" of matter and forces.

HET aligns with string theory’s premise but shifts focus from the strings themselves to the resonant patterns they create in space-time.


Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Dark matter is a form of resonance that doesn’t interact with electromagnetic waves, appearing ""invisible"" yet influencing space-time geometry.

Dark energy is a global resonant mode of space-time that drives expansion.

---

Mathematics of HET

1. Unified Wave Equation:

This describes how resonances propagate and interfere across scales, with extensions for higher dimensions.


2. Geometric Feedback:
Space-time curvature () emerges as a secondary wave resonance in response to the local energy density ():
, where  is the resonant contribution.


3. Resonance Modes and Energy:
The energy of a particle is proportional to its resonant frequency:
, where  is the fundamental frequency of the particle’s vibrational state.

---

Experimental Predictions and Tests

1. Electron Grouping

Bose-Einstein condensates and collective quantum states (like superfluidity) demonstrate how particles synchronize into large-scale resonances.



2. Cymatic Patterns

High-energy particle collisions should reveal resonant patterns analogous to cymatics, providing a ""resonant fingerprint"" of particle creation.



3. Gravitational Wave Interference

Cross-wave interactions (interference patterns of gravitational waves) could reveal the emergent nature of space-time’s resonances.



4. Quantum Gravity Experiments

Testing for deviations from general relativity at Planck-scale curvatures could reveal resonant structures in quantum space-time.

---

Broader Implications of HET

1. Cosmology

The Big Bang could be the emergence of a primordial resonance, creating all particles and fields as the universe’s first harmonic modes.

Cosmic structures (galaxies, clusters) are large-scale resonances stabilized over billions of years.

2. Philosophy

Reality is inherently dynamic and interconnected, dissolving the classical separation of ""particles"" and ""waves.""

Consciousness may arise as a self-reflective resonance within the brain’s wave network.

3. Technology

Resonance engineering could unlock quantum energy systems, advanced materials, and even space-time manipulation (e.g., warp drives).


---

Why HET is Plausible

HET builds on empirical foundations (quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory) while introducing a coherent resonant framework to unify them. It leverages known phenomena like interference, symmetry breaking, and emergence to fill in gaps without requiring entirely new physics.

An idea I had to assist lost players in these games,boomershooters,1i9r3ns,2025-01-25 11:47:30,11,0.93,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1i9r3ns/an_idea_i_had_to_assist_lost_players_in_these/,scarfleet,Misc,"I am not a game designer. But I think some of you are so tell me if you think this would work.

You have a game with classic boomer shooter level design with switches, backtracking, colored keys and so on.

But. If the game detects that the player has gone a certain length of time without an enemy encounter - ten minutes, fifteen minutes, you could tweak this - it spawns a new group of enemies into whatever room they are in.

These *could* just be the same enemies who were in that room originally. But I think ideally you make them a unique enemy type designed just for this purpose.

And then, quietly, the game also generates a new trail of pickups - health/ammo/armor etc - in rooms between the player and their next objective, to lead them back onto the critical path.

The idea would be that, out loud, the game acts like this is a punishment. Oops, you got lost in the hallways and were discovered by an enemy patrol.

But of course it isn't really a punishment at all, since it gives the player some of what they are craving - combat - along with fresh resources and a bit of subtle navigational help.

Has anyone tried this? I can't be the first person to think of it. I love my Quake 2/Boltgun compasses but I know they are controversial. The level design purists have some compelling arguments. So this might be another option. Anyway, that is for free if anyone wants it. I have never made a videogame, I could just be an idiot."
"Perpetuating Bad Education History in ""Most Likely to Succeed""",badhistory,1i9quq1,2025-01-25 11:36:34,45,0.93,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1i9quq1/perpetuating_bad_education_history_in_most_likely/,EdHistory101,,"10 years ago, the documentary ""Most Likely to Succeed"" premiered to much ballyhoo and celebration. Finally! Someone was calling out the problems with American education! These brave truth tellers were looking at back at history of schools in the country and naming what was wrong.

The problem - as it so often is - is the creators and director of the film invented or blurred history for the purpose of selling a particular approach to ""how to school."" In 2015, they got it wrong. This week, as they celebrate their 10th anniversary, they continue to get it wrong despite efforts to get them to set the record straight.

When announcing the anniversary showing that's happening later today, one of the creators connected with the project wrote the following:

> The film traces the roots of our current system back to 1892, when the Committee of Ten set recommendations for standardizing curricula to help transition from a primarily rural, agrarian society to an increasingly urban, industrial society. Decades earlier, Horace Mann visited Europe and became enamored by the Prussian system of education in which kids were sorted by age and taught discrete subjects in isolation—something completely new to the world at the time. Popularized by Mann, the Prussian model took off in America with the growing need to prepare workers for factory jobs where basic literacy, obedience, and the ability to do rote tasks were paramount.

Let's take it from the top. 

># the roots of our current system to 1892 ...  in which kids were sorted by age and taught discrete subjects in isolation

This ""system"" predates by 1892 by generations. Historians talk about ""weak"" and ""strong"" age segregation in American history and formal education fell along the continuum from the beginning. For example, while white boys and men of all ages could and did enroll at the early Colonial Colleges, only boys would attend feeder schools such as Boston Latin. [The failed Lancaster system](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/53848/mr-lancasters-system) attempted in some schools in the early 1800's was built on strong age segregation (older children teaching younger ones) and subject areas were a familiar construct. Readers and primers for children were published by age-bands and children were often ""sorted"" by age for all sorts of reasons. 

In 1828, the Buffalo High School Association placed an ad in the *Buffalo Emporium and General Advertiser* and referenced their by-laws, which spoke to the departmentalization already existing at the high school:

> The principle is to appoint employ such Professors, or Assistant Teachers, in the several Departments, as maybe determined necessary for the good reputation and rapid advancement of the School… 

Strong age segregation (i.e. 10 year old American children are typically in 5th grade) wouldn't become the universal norm until well into the 20th century when stand alone schools consolidated into school districts and states adopted age-based enrollment policies such as Kindergarten cut-offs linked to school funding and tax dollars.

> #when the Committee of Ten set recommendations for standardizing curricula 

The Committee of Ten - a workgroup funded by the National Education Association had zero policy or statutory power. They could not set anything beyond meeting agendas and to-do lists for their reports. Basically, the NEA wanted to take stock of what was happening in America's high schools. They surveyed schools across the country, collected statistics, organized data and lead work groups in debating what made the most sense. The report included dissenting views and like many things done by committee, hemmed and hawed about options. Despite the claim by Sal Kahn in the documentary itself, it wasn't made up entirely of university heads. Three of the men on the main committee were high school principals, including two from girl's high schools. Frustratingly enough, Kahn also claims they talked about requiring children to learn ""earth science."" Earth science as a subject didn't exist as a concept until the 20th century. Conveniently ignored by the film, the topic of Greek and Latin class consumed two entire workgroups. To put it bluntly, there is no mechanism in the United States for standardizing curriculum. We ended up with the modern liberal arts curriculum through a whole lot of trial and error, push and pull.

It took most of the 19th century but by 1820s, the shift from the classical liberal arts curriculum (Latin, Greek, some sciences, some languages, some math - all in service to teaching/learing content that men in power knew) to the early modern liberal arts curriculum (reading, writing, math, science, history, Greek and/or Latin) was nearly complete by 1892. (It would  be full on finalized by World War II due to a number of factors including the rise in the importance of the high school diploma, the concept of the Carnegie Unit, and the normalization of school as a thing kids did.)

> #transition from a primarily rural, agrarian society to an increasingly urban, industrial society.

I'm never really sure what to make of this claim because it is entirely vibes based. Lessons learned in urban schools about construction, organizing, enforcing attendance and more informed what happened in rural schools and vice versa. This is, alas, a common (mis)refrain. I get into a little more of [the bad history](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1cr7wrs/youre_breaking_my_heart_pbs_bad_history_in_a/) associated with this in a post about a PBS documentary. Most importantly, what happened in schools had very little to do with what happened outside of schools in any meaningful sense of the word. The goal of sending children to school wasn't to prepare them for jobs, be they agrarian or industrial. It was to ensure they became literate and knew stuff adults thought they should know (and other goals, but that's beyond the scope of this post.) To this, I offer, as I will again later, classes were sometimes held inside or near factories for the children who worked in said factories. What's the point of teaching children to read and write, etc. if they already had jobs in the factory?

> #Decades earlier, Horace Mann visited Europe and became enamored by the Prussian system of education

This is pure cosplay. Mann wasn't enamored with Prussia's system - Mann saw small moves they made that he thought were worth brining back. More to the point, he wasn't the only one to go and in many cases, the men who went did so because their state or community had a nascent public education system and they were looking for ways to expand or grow the system. In effect, they were looking to learn from Prussia's mistakes and successes around which levers to create in law. In one instance, a New York State schoolman, representing a public education system established in 1784, returned and offered:

> The methods in use in Prussia can not be adopted as a whole in New York. This is clear. Nevertheless, wise legislation would secure for us similar advantages, as the example of France, a sister republic, demonstrates.

The filmmakers seem to be fairly enamored with the Great Men of history idea and want Mann to be the father of American education. He wasn't; schools across the country were headed in the same direction as Prussia (and France and England and etc. etc.) long before Mann stepped foot on the boat. As mentioned, New York State's system was chartered in 1784. Pennsylvania's free school law, *An Act to Establish a General System of Education by Common Schools*, was passed on April 1, 1834. Mann went to Prussia in 1844.

> #taught discrete subjects in isolation—something completely new to the world at the time. 

Sigh. Teaching a particular style of handwriting to the sons of men in power in early America was such a specializing subject that only a handful of men were considered qualified enough to teach it. Men looking to pass the entrance exams for the Colonial Colleges sometimes had to hire multiple tutors - one for the Greek section, one for the Latin section, one for the maths and/or sciences. People around the world, throughout history, under the idea of having specialized knowledge and the power of learning from experts (which is, in effect, why we have subjects in schools.) Prussian education was cool and all but it wasn't a novel invention. 

> #Popularized by Mann, the Prussian model took off in America with the growing need to prepare workers for factory jobs where basic literacy, obedience, and the ability to do rote tasks were paramount.

You know what Prussians were really good at? Record keeping. You know what NYS schools were really good at in the 1840s, when Mann and other American schoolmen went to Prussia? Record keeping. Prussia also elevated the role of teacher from a fly by job done by men to something more permanent and ensured every teacher had a bell in their classroom to better keep track of time (again, record keeping.) There were schools inside factories! Factory jobs at the time didn't require literacy! Schools didn't invent obedience - that's the general air of Protestantism in this country. 

I wrote [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_model_school) about the factory model out of sheer frustration and frustrated I shall remain as I've spent 10 years addressing the bad history in [*Most Likely to Succeed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Likely_to_Succeed_\(film\)) and among advocates of the sentiments expressed in the film. Here's hoping they fix it by the 20th."
Arising and Passing Away (A&P): What actually changed for you?,streamentry,1i9qpgj,2025-01-25 11:30:05,10,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/1i9qpgj/arising_and_passing_away_ap_what_actually_changed/,periodicpoint,Vipassana,"Hey folks! Almost exactly two years ago to the day I found myself deep into the magical and challenging Arising and Passing Away (A&P) territory after I stumbled into the first jhana which in itself I today would classify as a classic A&P event (which was doubly confusing for me and others at that time). [This experience led to my first post here. And I am still deeply grateful for all your great support you gave me back then!](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/10lzm6m/spontaneous_1th_jhana_with_direct_intense_pitty/) 🙏

Since then, I have been inevitably diving deep into the dharma (with the help of teachers,  books, podcasts,  etc.), because my goodness! 😅 Since then, I also cycled through A&P every 6 month or so.

One thing that struck me was that I noticed some permanent changes, of which the most prominent are:

1. A deep sense of trust and love regarding the dharma.
2. Increased intuition, in particular with other people.
3. Increased reaction time and more economic reflexes.

There seems to be other similar experiences. [See for example the post: Catching things mid air.](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/1guxbca/catching_things_mid_air/)

[Daniel Ingram in Mastering The Core Teachings of the Buddha (MCTB)](https://www.mctb.org/) talks about A&P as a point of no return where there are some irreversible changes, which keeps the meditator cycling starting from Mind and Body (nāma-rūpa pariccheda-ñāṇa) via A&P and up to Equanimity (saṅkhārupekkhā-ñāṇa). The original texts (udayabbaya ñana, udayabbayānupassanā-ñāṇa ) of course also seems to describe some permanent, irreversible changes for the meditator. For example, some sources mention that there is somehow no way back after the A&P. Yet, I find very little concrete information on the actual phenomenology and concrete possible lasting effects–if there are any.

Though, what is really important, are exactly those (possible) changes on an individual experimentally level. Hence, I am super curious about your actual personal lived experience:

1. **Question: What changed permanently for you post A&P?**
2. **Question: And for those who have entered the stream, how do those changes compare?**

Specifically I am interested in concrete, permanent and micro-phenomenology changes:

1. Consciousness and perception
2. Emotional landscape
3. Cognitive patterns
4. Day-to-day behavior

Would love to hear your experiences and opinions. The more specific, the better! 🙂

**Note 1:** As fascinating as the fireworks during the A&P experience itself are, I am more interested in what changed for you *after* that and never went back to baseline.

**Note 2:** Obviously, I am aware that everyone's path is different. I am just curious and trying to get a sense of the territory."

**1. Electronic voices can be understood as**

* **Unique identifier:** Can be thought of as a barcode.
* **Information:** Data that has meaning or significance for the person receiving it. It is the basis for decision-making and communication. Attention => it is also necessary to take into account that data may not have meaning for you (consciousness), but it does have meaning for the brain (it is data) => that it has ""meaning"" for the brain does not mean that it makes sense (the subconscious does not evaluate logic, meaning) => the emergence of unconscious associations and patterns of behavior.
* Interference patterns

**2. Electronic voices are part of several phenomena**

* Gangstalking
* **Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP):** Audio manifestations purportedly originating as communication between spirits and humans via audio devices. Although the scientific community generally does not consider EVP to be evidence of ghosts or the paranormal, the phenomenon remains popular among paranormal enthusiasts and in popular culture. Often referred to as ""noise"" as a means of amplifying voices (it is, of course, a ""backing layer"").
* **Subliminal perception:** The perception of stimuli that are too weak for our conscious mind to notice.
* Synthetic telepathy
* Targeted individual
* Voice to skull (V2K)

**3. Many names for the same thing**

**3.1. Classical, standard, general interpretations**

Or a professional and lay perspective

**4. What are electronic votes being abused for?**

* Manipulation, influencing
* Targeted harassment on the internet
* Primitive, perverted fun

**5. Electronic voices: What are they used for in the context of harassment?**

* Entity
* False inner voice or dialogue
* Manipulation of individuals or groups
* Making sounds that only the victim can hear
* Speaking to the victim using voices that only the victim can hear
* Influencing environmental sounds, creating specific sounds (most often voices)
* Rhythmic stimuli

**6. Electronic voices: Insights in the context of gangstalking and hearing voices**

* **This is one of the topics whose solution (disclosure of knowledge) perpetrators try to defend hysterically:** Another such issue is, for example, listening to other people's mobile phones (hacking, radiohacking).

**7. What do electronic voices sound like?**

* **In general:** They can sound like anything (have any color). The natural properties of the brain to constantly search for familiar patterns are often abused => some interference patterns only ""slightly"" or ""slightly"" resemble, for example, the ""noise of trees"" so typical of a stay at a cottage, or the voice of one of your friends.
* Chorus
* COMB Filter
* Flanges
* Hum
* **Regular clicking sounds:** An interesting phenomenon can be mentioned in the context of clicking. When trying to imagine a constantly accelerating clicking that smoothly transitions to a buzzing sound (for example), you will find that it is impossible. At a certain point, the mind seems to ""get stuck"". This is because they are essentially different sounds (interference patterns) => different types of information (sticking to the topic). If you have not ""listened"" (learned, studied) the specific course of the individual phases (and the individual transitions - interactions - between the individual states), it is difficult to imagine them (it is like imagining the voice of a person you do not know and then how they sing or laugh). In the context of electronic voices (and harassment in this way), there is also a constant insinuation (learning) of a specific pattern (distortion of information) => an unconscious conditioned reflex => can be described as a ""rebound from the barrier"" => you are supposed to imagine an accelerating clicking and at a certain moment start returning to a slower one. In this case, a constant tone is used as an underlining (""attention"" is focused on the clicking), which rises smoothly up and then down again.
* Sounds resembling the human voice
* A swarm of bees, flies, or other insects
* Drone sound
* Vuvuzela
* TRUMPET
* Violin
* Wind, breeze, draft
* High-frequency whistling
* Chants
* Endless tunnel passage
* Distant, endless train passing by
* **Uncertain music:** Here I will mention a relatively big problem in the form of ""pareido something"" (searching for patterns), real interference with various electronic voices (e.g. parasitic radio signals) and even natural (and at the same time unnatural due to human activity =. technology, radio networks, electrification network) melodies of the environment.
* **Rhythmically repeating noise:** It may resemble the sound of bells, for example
* A voice that keeps changing
* Low-frequency rumbling
* Impulsive sounds
* Noise

**8. Electronic voices: Frequent appearances**

* **Sensable vibrations in the feet:** This phenomenon is mentioned by too many victims of targeted harassment (gangstalking) to be a coincidence.
* **Whistling in the ears:** Usually interpreted as Tinnitus, or for example fatigue, stress, etc.
* Hearing sounds (most often voices) that no one else can hear
* **Vibration and microvibration:** Which means mechanical waves => audible sound may or may not be produced => here is an additional factor: the threshold of consciousness => sound may be audible, but only to the brain => from the point of view of consciousness it seems to not exist and at the same time sound that really does not exist and only arises, for example, due to the nonlinear properties of the human auditory system => it cannot be captured by any technology and therefore cannot be recorded => yet an individual (or a group showing influence by the same environment) hears it => sound exists and does not exist at the same time! (both sides will be right). After the authors of (my favorite) international diagnostic manuals (i.e. the professional community => authority) also become educated, there will be a change to a similar phenomenon: ""someone is an excellent musician"" and ""someone is not"" => a generally recognized, and also true, phenomenon.

**9. The term electronic voice is mainly associated with communication**

* Entity
* **Roles, characters:** Those the perpetrators pretend to be during the harassment (child, police officer, psychopath)
* **Unique identifier in the context of voice:** Not every victim who hears voices can consciously distinguish (hear) a specific electronic voice (voice timbre). Perpetrators often abuse this, especially with quiet voices (whispers), when it is not clear what one perpetrator said and what the other said => everything seems to be one type of voice => information merges.
* **Emotions:** Psychophysiological reactions of the organism to stimuli from the internal or external environment that influence behavior, thinking, and decision-making.
* Emotional tone of voice
* Contextual information
* **Information:** Data that has meaning or significance for the person receiving it. It is the basis for decision-making and communication. Attention => it is also necessary to take into account that data may not have meaning for you (consciousness), but it does have meaning for the brain (it is data) => that it has ""meaning"" for the brain does not mean that it makes sense (the subconscious does not evaluate logic, meaning) => the emergence of unconscious associations and patterns of behavior.

**10. Electronic voices: General ways of perception**

**10.1. Perception of stimuli from the perspective of the individual**

* **Conscious:** Usually hearing voices or different sounds
* **Conscious => out of attention:** They can manifest themselves similarly to subliminal => influence thinking, emotions without the victim being aware of it.
* **Conscious => misinterpreted:** For example, a false inner voice, inner dialogue, hearing thoughts, communication with spirits, etc. The interpretation (awareness) of such stimuli is influenced mainly by knowledge (the ability to process the stimulus using other - more probable and in the context of related situations much more logical and functional - patterns => the stimulus is perceived as external and not as, for example, an ""inner voice""). Knowledge also allows us to defend the WHOLE (mutual connections, interactions, connections, etc.)
* **Unconscious => subliminal:** The victim is not aware of hearing (perceiving) such stimuli. Even so, they can (and often do) influence behavior, decision-making, emotions, and psyche.
* **Seemingly non-existent:** This is the perception of stimuli that arise only due to subjective properties (for example, nonlinear properties of hearing, etc.)

**10.2. General aspects in the context of the perception of interference patterns**

* **Voices and sounds with unlearned focus:** Such sounds can be perceived (heard) in different ways. Not at all, subliminally, consciously in individuals (for example, due to subjective hearing properties or due to environmental properties), consciously in a larger group of people, only in a certain environment, etc.
* **Voices and sounds that can only be heard when interfering with a specific interference pattern:** A specific interference pattern can be the sound (tone) of the environment, the sound of a specific fan, the sound of air conditioning, the sound of a moving tram, the voice of a specific person, the sound of breathing, the sound of blood flowing in the ears, etc.
* **Voices and sounds intended for targeted harassment:** These are perceived only by the individual or individuals and no one else in the vicinity. These are usually cases where ""someone"" (usually the victim) hears voices that no one else can hear => referred to as a manifestation of a mental disorder or hallucination.
* **Voices and sounds that are to be perceived subliminally:** A person should not be aware of hearing (processing) them at all. Due to limited to low cognitive abilities, of course, many of these ""exclusively subliminal"" sounds can be heard, or some people gradually learn to hear them (and thus become victims; they are already victims of, for example, another perpetrator; individuals who are not directly the target of harassment => ""only"" hear voices)
* **Voices and sounds heard in the context of (based on) expectations:** Goals, intentions, patterns of behavior, knowledge. For example, crossing a pedestrian crossing => a person reacts to the calling of his name, but especially to the screeching of brakes (imminent danger). Much less to the singing of birds nearby (not important in the context of the situation).
* **Voices and sounds perceived in the context of knowledge:** Someone knows that this or that sound is part of a ""diesel generator"", someone else thinks it's a fan, and someone else perceives it as part of the environment. And there are those who know that this or that sound (interference pattern, or for example its sound manifestation) is present (either in the same or a similar sound form) in several (or many) different situations (example: standardized apartment units => ambient tone).
* **Voices and sounds and their perception in the context of attention:** Performing a certain activity and not paying attention to surrounding sounds (e.g. responding only to calling one's name). Varies according to knowledge, their contexts and the connection to the current situation (e.g. targeted harassment by sounds)

**10.3. Various aspects of stimulus perception in the context of conscious influence**

* **Conscious perception: External stimuli that cannot be influenced:** A person perceives electronic voices in the same way as ordinary sounds (hearing voices). If such voices are annoying (which is the basic essence of annoyance) => a person logically wants to change such a state => however, the professional community, according to international diagnostic manuals, labels this state as a ""manifestation of a serious mental disorder"" or a ""hallucination"" (thus exacerbating the problem in a completely bizarre way).
* **External stimuli that can be influenced more or less:** This is an area seemingly full of various uncertainties, ambiguities, paradoxes, evidence and counter-evidence, arguments, conspiracy theories, stereotypical prejudices, etc. etc. This is of course not a coincidence or ""coincidence"" (manipulation of the victim remotely as part of targeted harassment is, for example, one of the factors). However, here too, the same applies => specific information leads to specific conclusions. The topic is discussed in detail in a separate thread (or in the context of this view => in a separate article).

**11. Types of voices in the context of the phenomenon of hearing voices**

**11.1. In the context of persons**

* **Different voice colors and genders:** Male, female, girl, boy, child, etc.
* **Voices with strong intonation or emotional coloring:** Various sequences of sounds resembling words or words themselves. Because it is a ""supporting layer"" (supporting sounds) => the victim is usually not aware of it (he notices it only when the ""content layer"" is missing => at the same time it is also necessary to know the overall context of the situation and the individual connections)
* **They sound the same or very similar to the voices of specific people:** Someone from the neighborhood, friends, family, actors, public figures, etc.
* **Voice of a specific person:** For example, long-term associated with a specific entity.

**11.2. In the context of perception**

* **Quiet, subliminal:** Voices de facto copy the threshold of audibility. As a rule, it is not possible to determine any elements related to voice color, intonation, gender, etc.
* **Rhythmic:** Voices de facto copy the threshold of audibility. As a rule, it is not possible to determine any elements related to voice color, intonation, gender, etc.
* **Unintelligible:** Sounds like mumbling, indeterminate words, word fragments, phonemes (see carrier and content layer above)

**11.3. In the context of localization, the environment**

* **Sounds that seem to originate near the ear or directly in the ear itself:** Can only be observed in certain situations (lying on your side => space between the ear and the pillow), placing your palm against your ear, placing your ear close to a surface, but not completely (e.g. a wall).
* **Voices that originate in the sound of breathing (or other body sounds):** These elements seem to be the most fun for perpetrators.
* **Voices that come from the surroundings or from a greater distance:** Neighbors, the surroundings of the house, reflections on the wall of the opposite building. Unlike most other manifestations - in these contexts they can ""make sense"" => be a natural part of the environment => therefore not everyone notices that these are parasitic sounds (normal city traffic, sounds in apartment blocks). These mechanisms are often the basis for scenarios in the context of inducing paranoid feelings and ideas ""I feel like these people are talking about me"", ""I heard the neighbors saying my name"", etc.
* **Voices whose source (direction of sound) is not easy to determine:** The source of the sound seems to change depending on what the victim is focusing on (or what they think is the source of the sounds). A combination of two phenomena (name) and subjective hearing characteristics (shape of the ears, resonant frequency of the ear canal, etc.)
* **Voices that can be heard in various environmental sounds:** Noise of heating, fan, air conditioning, running water, wind, etc. It is the same principle as with the ears => Use of specific interference patterns (sounds).
* **Voices that are only audible in impulse (impact) sounds:** Tapping a fingernail on a tabletop, typing on a keyboard, etc.

**11.4. In the context of the psyche**

* **Negative, critical:** (here - and only here - the international diagnostic manuals ""went crazy""). They can encourage dangerous actions or cause anxiety and paranoia. These voices can be a source of significant stress and can worsen a person's psychological state. Often associated with mental disorder.

**12. Electronic voices: Basic ways of distinguishing**

* **Sound color:** What most people use to distinguish a guitar from a piano, or to identify which friend has a particular voice (identifier). Individual colors are created by different interference patterns (spectral composition).
* **Voice color:** Voice color can be viewed from several angles => sound color and also emotional coloring. We also ""expect"" an emotional component in the human voice more than, for example, the buzzing of a mosquito or a humming air conditioner (although even in such sounds one can find ""emotional"" - interference - components characteristic of emotions). It is also necessary to take into account the fact that people with musical hearing are much more sensitive to the emotions contained in the human voice.
* **The sound manifestation of a specific interference pattern (now regardless of other factors such as environment, hearing, etc.):** In simple terms, the mechanism by which we perceive one sound as O and another as, for example, U or A. However, this phenomenon can be viewed from multiple angles => ultimately, sounds such as A, E, I, O, etc. are just different colors of sound (interference patterns).
* **Melody:** Melody can be created (or rather is created) not only by ""playing"" different tones (for example, individual piano keys), but also by seemingly static tones. It is created due to the interference of individual frequencies (certain frequencies slowly add up and at a certain moment they cancel out others and are subsequently themselves canceled out => this is repeated over and over again => if there is no cancellation of frequencies and they keep adding up, the well-known phenomenon - ""coupling microphone"" will occur). How ""clear"" this melody is also depends on the speed of individual cycles. It can manifest itself as AEOAEO, AAOAAO, etc. (if you suspect something here in the context of hearing voices - it is ""just"" a logical deduction => it will be specified in more detail)
* **Loudness (audibility):** For simplicity, it can be imagined as whispering and normal speaking. Interesting fact => you cannot sing in a whisper. A whispered voice has its own specific interference pattern, which is always the same (even when we speak loudly) => more precisely the same within the context (some frequencies can be temporarily muted within interaction cycles - interference, melody, color) but the whole remains unchanged (something like when you make a black line across a purple sheet of paper and then erase it => you still know that it is a purple sheet). This pattern arises (among other things) due to the shape of the throat, mouth, etc. This interference pattern can of course be significantly influenced (changed) by the method of recording.

**13. Electronic voices: Basic mechanisms**

**13.1. Electronic Voices: Learning in the Context of Harassment**

* **Learning most often takes place during sleep:** Nighttime peace, less traffic => fewer disturbing signals (stimuli). Also, long-term static position and long-term same position (bed). That is why perpetrators are most active at night.
* It takes a person several years to learn to listen to interference sounds (interference patterns, electronic voices)
* **The victim is overwhelmed by a group of the same sounds and sequences that sound like mumbling or unintelligible speech (similar to a loud television from the neighbors):** These are various interference sequences. The principle is similar to when a person learns to speak. He hears dozens or hundreds of people using his native language => a person (or rather the brain) is therefore sensitive to the finest nuances (we often immediately recognize who is and is not a native speaker). Speech itself is just a sequence of certain interference patterns (sounds => phonetic sequences). If the victim is taught only the same patterns - the result may be a situation where only he and no one else hears a given sound (voice, speech). It is also necessary to take into account that these indefinite sounds can remain the same (carrier sound) and the information content can be different each time (whispering).
* **In an attempt to impose a specific type of ""inner voice"" on the victim, perpetrators often repeat the victim's activity on the computer:** In particular, the text that he reads or writes, numbers or words that he stores in short-term memory (phonological loop). For those who think of questions in the context of ""hitting on specific words"" now only briefly (patterns, illusions, various interference patterns, the way the brain processes information and other techniques => will be written in a separate thread).

**13.2. Electronic voices: Hearing**

* **Everyone can hear interference sounds (electronic voices => interference patterns) differently:** For example, due to the subjective properties of hearing. This is a similar phenomenon to the FLANGER, CHORUS, COMB FILTER effects in the context of interference - mutual interaction - of individual frequencies). If an individual is less sensitive to a certain frequency band (old age, hearing impairment, wearing headphones, tinnitus) => other frequencies may be emphasized (directed attention). In addition, the brain calculates these ""dead spots"" (missing frequencies) itself (but ""only"" based on assumptions => learned patterns) => And this only if it is aware of the fact that some frequencies are missing - i.e. the difference from normal => it processes (evaluates) the input data (stimulus) in this way based on previous iterations (experience, knowledge).
* **They can sound different depending on the environment:** Similar principle as in the previous point. Each place has its own tone (interference pattern => standing waves, resonant frequency of the room, air column, etc.) => ""tone of the place"" also applies to the ear canal (ears).
* **They may sound different during the day and at night:** The basic factor is, of course, the ""city noise"". This is also why some people work so well at night and some think so well early in the morning.
* **To hear electronic voices, a carrier sound is needed:** Such a sound can be basically anything. More fundamental in this context is the division into ""artificially created interference patterns"" (e.g., whistling from a mobile phone, electromagnetic induction, etc.) and natural interference patterns (environment, reflection of city noise from nearby houses, neighbors' refrigerator, drafts)
* Certain interference patterns (tones) are constantly repeated in the context of certain environments (apartment, space in front of the house, sound coming from an open window, etc.)"
Future of SoD characters beyond next phase?,classicwow,1i9pe9p,2025-01-25 10:32:13,0,0.27,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1i9pe9p/future_of_sod_characters_beyond_next_phase/,ArgvargSWE,Season of Discovery ,"Now that it seems more clear that SoD will not have a significant future beyond next phase, a lot of players including myself, feels sad. Do you think it is 100% impossible Blizz would make you be able to transfer your SoD chars to Anni fresh realms? I understand that SoD specific gears, items and runes etc would not carry over. Leveling is also quicker on SoD than Classic and that could be a problem and players would harass that aspect. But maybe Blizz could give a lvl 50 voucher on Classic for every 60 char on SoD? I am just speculating. I just know that many players feel frustrated due to being abandoned by Blizz on SoD realms and how could Blizz ""reimburse"" them or at least lessen the blow? Thoughts? (And yes, I realize everything must come to an end, I accept that, but im just curious)."
Office 365 Classic Subscription - NEW CUSTOMERS,microsoft,1i9pc55,2025-01-25 10:29:24,12,0.93,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/1i9pc55/office_365_classic_subscription_new_customers/,7heMessenger,Office 365,"Hello interwebs,

Wanted to share how to subscribe as a new customer to the 365 Classic packages. I've been doing loads of research, none of which seemed to indicate how to work around the new pricing model as a new customer.

Thankfully, Microsoft offers prorating ( **limited to specific countries** \- [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/countries-with-prorated-refunds-for-microsoft-subscriptions-38c81df4-10c1-f3eb-8d2f-b04f980c435f](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/countries-with-prorated-refunds-for-microsoft-subscriptions-38c81df4-10c1-f3eb-8d2f-b04f980c435f) ), so I thought it wouldn't hurt to experiment. After a few full refunds, this is what I found to be the best course of action:

***Subscribe to your desired Office 365 plan (Personal/Family/etc.) for 1 month > Manage > Cancel > Select ""Or buy at CAD $XXXX/year"" (under the Switch plan button).***

In my particular case, I went with the 1 month of 365 Personal, immediately followed the above steps and was provided an option to switch to 365 Personal Classic, + convert it to a yearly sub instead.

Although you have to essentially pay an added cost ($3.50 CAD for me), the subscription will automatically switch to the original 365 Classic the following month and remain recurring.

  
Happy savings!!! <3"

Aside from the classics of mortgage, taxes, PMI - what would you say your average other expenses are? Utilities, trash, etc. Our home would likely be 1500 sq ft or less based on our budget. I know it depends on the house, but hearing some actual numbers would be HUGELY helpful!

Bully 2 ideas,bully,1i9odet,2025-01-25 09:43:10,3,0.8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bully/comments/1i9odet/bully_2_ideas/,ManOfWrathTX,,"Okay, so I'm probably the 100,000th person to make this sort of post, but I'm gonna make one myself anyways because a man can dream.

Since Rockstar claims that they never moved forward with a Bully 2 because it felt too similar to the previous game, here are some ideas that I feel could be implemented to justify the sequel.

\***Multiple Protagonists** \- Taking from GTA 5's playbook, I think Bully 2 can benefit from having multiple playable characters. Maybe dual protagonists or a trio for the sake of multiple mission perspectives and play styles. Hot take, but one character, I think, should be a girl, and before I get ""wOkE gArBaGe"" comments, I think that having a girl serve as a playable character can add another layer to combat and gameplay, namely, cat-fights, since hitting girls in the last game served as a prefect spawn and instant-bust. With multiple characters there can be the classic ""warrior, thief, and mage"" dynamic, where one character is best at throwing hands, another character is best with sneak attacks, and the third character is best with weapons.

\***Body-type adjuster** \- Like with RDR2 and GTA SA, the player's body type can be adjusted in addition to all of the other customization options. Too much or too little food can make them fat or skinny, etc. Going to gym class can keep one in shape.

\***New Cliques** \- Returning should be Jocks and Nerds, but there can be an ""otaku"" clique which are stereotypical anime fans, a goth/emo/scene clique, ""karate-kid"" clique (shoutout to Cobra Kai), ""Soldier Boys"" which is ROTC, and the wannabe gangster clique.

\***Fighting Styles** \- The main characters can take classes and join clubs that teach different martial arts styles like boxing, wrestling (both traditional and WWE-style), karate, etc.

\***New Weapons** \- These can include paintball guns, BB-Guns, boxing gloves, plastic lightsabers, etc

\***""WorldStar"" system** \- Now, whenever a fight happens students will pull out cell phones and record. These fights will show up on an in-universe website that mimics WSHH. It can be an interesting way to watch replays of previous fights.

\***Expanded Skateboard and Bicycle system** \- Now skateboarding and riding bicycles have a ""style"" and trick system like with the Skate and Tony Hawk games. Skateboards and bikes are also thoroughly customizable with stickers and wheels, etc.

\***Clique Builder** \- Now the player can start their own clique/gang. The clique can have their own style of dress and members of their choosing. The player can have their own safe/clubhouse that's customizable, etc.

**\*Nemesis System/""Social Ladder""** \- This is pulling from the Shadow of Mordor/War games, but the Nemesis system would be one of the biggest features. Since every student has a name, their own strengths and weaknesses, etc, and the school has a built-in hierarchy, every win and loss in a fight can have meaning. If the player loses a fight with one student, the student that won can move up the schools's social ladder while the player loses respect from everyone else. If the player hunts down and beats that student, they will move up the ladder and get respect, etc. Unlike the first game, that means the ""respect"" system will be completely dynamic throughout the game, with NPC's constantly shifting on the ladder.

**\*More Mini-Games** \- The first game was chock full of mini-games. There should be more in the sequel, such as a pick-up basketball, football, soccer, in-universe arcade games that mimic street fighter/tekken, a paint-ball arena that's an FPS, a garage band that serves like guitar-hero, etc

**\*Karma Meter** \- Something else borrowed from RDR. How well-behaved the player is can affect the in-game karma meter which influences the play experience. Well-behaved players will have an easier time dealing with prefects and authority, who won't pursue as heavily or may even turn a blind eye to mischief. Certain cliques will respond to your behavior, with cliques like the ""wannabe gangstas"" responding well to bad behavior. In-game girlfriend results will vary, with some girls wanting a ""bad boy"" and other girls wanting a ""nice guy"", etc.

**\*Keep the game set in Bullworth** \- This can add a lot to fanservice. People may want to know what became of the old characters, such as Pete Kowalski having run Bullworth Academy for some time and getting rich. Jimmy Hopkins becoming a pretty successfuly mechanic after the events of the first game. Lola getting involved with the mayor and cheating on him. Darby Harrington going broke. Beatrice finding the cure for cancer. Algie marrying a supermodel, etc.

I'm not paid to design games, so what do I know. I'd like to think Bully 2 has a lot of potential. Thoughts?"
iPod 5th generation white screen,eBaySellerAdvice,1i9o2sk,2025-01-25 09:28:40,3,0.71,12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9o2sk,Performance_Lanky,Problem Buyer,"Really not my month with stuff going wrong. 

So I sold an old 5th generation iPod classic 60GB video device. It had been lying around gathering dust. 
Basically I charged it and it worked (picture attached), so I sold it fully charged, having detailed scuff marks etc in the description. 

It took a few weeks to get to its destination. The seller says it has a white screen (picture attached) that doesn’t change no matter if it’s charged or they try resetting it. 

Should I offer a refund, partial refund, or something else? Given that like my other item it now can’t be sold in the same category if it’s now broken.

Best thing about Buffy and Angel were the monsters,buffy,1i9nml2,2025-01-25 09:05:51,7,0.73,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/1i9nml2/best_thing_about_buffy_and_angel_were_the_monsters/,PlaneAutomatic4965,,"I don't know about this page, but generally in most mainstream articles I tend to see people go on about how the monsters and creatures were largely unimportant in Buffy. What really mattered was its heart and how it touched on important issues about growing up and so on, hence why the Body is seen as the best as it's ""proper tv"" and not just silly monsters. 

Personally however I think this is bullshit and undercuts the accomplishments of so many people involved in the show. To me the monsters were the most important part. Obviously the characters were good and the actors who played them were excellent too. However great characters will only take you so far. If you don't have cool monsters and creatures to fight against, you won't seem as impressive. 

(A shining example of this is the Buffy movie. Overall it's a decent movie that does stick to Joss's feminist message of the ordinary girl who learns she has powers, who does things here way and Kristy Swanson is good in the role, funny, charismatic, sexy etc. However the vampires are lame. They aren't scary, they don't seem threatening and so Buffy doesn't feel as much of a hero as she would in the show when she kills them.) 

Now where Buffy's monsters were better than pretty much any other genre show except the original Doctor Who series, is that I think they always tried to make each monster distinct, unusual and interesting. Whether that was in how it looks, how it killed, its motives, what it represented, and its personality, with guest actors often being given a chance to give a proper performance in the role too. Even if the monster was mute like the Turok Han, Camden Toy still gave an excellent performance because it had so much presence in the story and character even just in terms of how vicious and scary it was. 

Most other shows sadly I think when it comes to monster of the week stories don't bother. They tend to view them as filler and treat them as such. Look at Smallville with its meteor freak  of the week episodes? They were all just variations of the same thing. This week the kryptonite mutates a bug guy, this week it mutates someone with fire powers etc. 

Same with Supernatural. So many of its monsters of the week were just generic. Angry spirits that wanted to kill someone for some reason, this week its a ghost who goes after unfaithful men, this week its a racist ghost that goes after black men, whilst their creatures tended to just be things that ate people and kept their victims locked up in a warehouse, and visually they looked the same, just guys with fangs. Similarly Charmed often its guest monsters visually looked similar and were just warlocks or demons who wanted the book and their powers were just energy balls. 

Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying these shows were bad. I love all of them and they all had their own individual strengths and their main villains were all excellent too like Crowley, Lionel Luthor etc. 

However to me Buffy like I said treated ever monster of the week as a special event and therefore had the largest and most varied and interesting set of monsters, again along with Classic DW (obviously this also applies to Angel.) 

Whilst the Buffy monsters may have explored similar themes of growing up I don't think they ever fell into a pattern like the angry spirits in Supernatural. For instance the She Mantis, Catherine Madison, Marcia Ross, James Stanley and Grace Newman etc, all reflect horrible aspects of High School, but none are similar in terms of powers, motives or even origins. 

Of course this is also not to say that Buffy and Angel sometimes didn't make mistakes in how they portrayed the monsters. Beer Bad for instance was a pretty poor monster of the week episode, but even then I feel it was more of a noble effort, as it was still an attempt to do a different kind of monster that would look unique and represent something different, it just didn't work. 

Overall to me the monsters where at the crux of the show. They gave it its edge, made Buffy seem like a better hero and role model, pushed the characters to their limits more etc. I think that season 6 when the monsters took a back seat is when the show reached its low point, demonstrating how important they were.

First try at a honey butter fat washed bourbon. Attempting a Black Manhattan. Need bitters and garnish suggestions.,cocktails,1i9n1s3,2025-01-25 08:35:00,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1i9n1s3/first_try_at_a_honey_butter_fat_washed_bourbon/,Warden18,Recommendations,"Saw a video on a honey butter fat washed bourbon (Black Manhattan) last night. I followed the general recipe for the honey butter fat washed bourbon. Now, looking for ideas as to what bitters and garnish. Any suggestions?

For reference, the video suggests:

2.5oz honey butter fat washed bourbon

1oz Averna 

2-3 dashes chocolate bitters 

Some sort of chocolate honey/honeycomb candy for garnish (I've bought some in the past, but doubt I could get some from a regular grocery store on short notice). 

Garnish aside, my biggest hang-up is probably the bitters. I have Fee Brothers Aztec Chocolate bitters. Usually I'm not a fan because it reminds me of Tootsie Rolls. For some reason I smelled it last night and I smelled slightly less sweet coke syrup. Which... To me was a pleasant surprise, but I was still almost taken aback at the perceived change in smell. 

 Now, I'm willing to try it if others think it sounds appropriate, but I was thinking either Black Walnut or... Maybe molasses? I'm not sure. I have a huge selection from Fee Brothers, and then several more classic bitters (Ango, Peychauds, Orange, etc). 

Lastly, if anyone think another Amaro might work better than Averna, I'm all ears. I probably have 12+ Amaros. Anything from Cynar, Fernet Branca, Amaro Nonino, Pineapple Amaro, Montenegro, Vigo Amaro, etc. 

Thank you in advance! "

Like does that make sense. I don't want to commit suicide but I don't want to be alive ether. Literally when driving to work sometimes i just wish someone will just hit me head on and fucking kill me. I'm tired of being a disappointment to everyone around me. Especially myself and my boyfriend. Im scared about not finding a job with this stupid major and disappointing my parents. I'm scared that my boyfriend will want to break up with me because i continually disappoint him over and over with my mood swings. 

I keep making him feel like he's the worst boyfriend ever. It makes me so sad because he's not. It's just issues we need to work on. Sometimes i feel like reached my limits with him but there are times I feel like i just haven't tried hard enough to make it work. It's just hard trying to figure out our communication styles. Because of that it leads to fight, misunderstandings, etc. I'm going to lose my first love over stupid ass communication issues. Like COME ON. Such an easy, and simple fucking fix. We been through so much and we can't even get through that. Ffs. I feel like all i do is disappoint him. Make him second fucking guess himself. 

On my way to work this morning I was praying a drunk driver or an idiot on their phone would fuck up and run me off the road. Maybe then will i realize i need to get my shit together if i survive. If i do die oh fucking well. My bf will get what he wants which is to give up on me, and i dont have to see my life when i can't find employment bc of this dumbass degree. I know people will be sad if i died but Im a person who believes there is a positive in every sad outcome. The sure would be a fuck ton if i died. Like i swear to fucking god in the way home can 18 wheeler just ram in the back of my car so i can be gone and not have to see what shit future im going to have. So I don't have to make anyone else disappointed. "

An in depth review and summary of floor section seats at Intuit Dome with pictures (January 2025),LAClippers,1i9lo3i,2025-01-25 07:12:38,11,0.92,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAClippers/comments/1i9lo3i/an_in_depth_review_and_summary_of_floor_section/,Dazzling_Ideal_7652,Discussion,"I'll split this review into three sections: pre-event, in-event, and post-event. This will be long but I hope it answers any thoughts or questions you may have about the new arena before you plan to go one day. No, this is not a paid advertisement of the arena and I will go over both the good and bad that I've experienced. I aim to give insight as to what I experienced but your experience may be different depending on when you are reading this.

***Pre-event:***

**1. Purchasing the tickets**

Tickets were bought through Gametime. If you buy on any third party platform, such as Gametime or Seat Geek, be sure it redirects you to Ticketmaster tickets after purchase as you'll be linking your Intuit Dome account with your Ticketmaster account to access your tickets at the time of writing this.

[Purchased on Gametime app: Accepted the tickets and ensured Ticketmaster is linked to my Intuit Dome account](https://preview.redd.it/j8fu1150i4fe1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e0d5eea775e5602d8d7819fb1700487a78176e)

[Top left logos indicate accounts are successfully linked and they appear on my Intuit Dome account](https://preview.redd.it/xgx6tcx5m4fe1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13a4d92bfd42db31c681141c729a97118245d71c)

**2. Setting up the app**

I used an iPhone 11. It can be a bit laggy at times which is a slight annoyance but I was able to set everything up in 10 minutes. The app walks you through the basics and you'll provide stuff like your date of birth, name, phone number, etc. You're trading some privacy for convenience at the end of the day. You can always opt not to do some convenience features like gameface ID or credit card on file, but it just means you may spend a bit more time in line or have to fumble through your wallet when you purchase something, for example. Anyway, linked my ticketmaster account with my intuit dome account and my tickets showed up in the ""my tickets"" section. If you purchase a parking pass to Intuit Dome parking lots, they will show up here as well. If you have any additional questions, staff are helpful in guiding you through the app. Once you set up your app the initial time, it's very rare you'll need to touch it again. Before heading out, its good practice to assign tickets to your party if they have an intuit dome account or assign them as your dependent if they do not have one.

[Ticket will appear green but still in your possession if you assign the ticket to someone else with an Intuit Dome account. ](https://preview.redd.it/j1ekgn5vn4fe1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81a1326e0fb07a393a13492b010cd4692b64ff5c)

**3. Getting to the arena**

If you're coming from the 105 fwy, avoid exiting Prairie, take Crenshaw or Hawthorne instead. If you take Prairie, you'll need to make a left if you're coming from the east exit and there is usually a backup of cars trying to make said left, creating a lot of traffic at this exit. If you bought tickets to the west garage, there's entrances at Prairie or Century. Player's garage entrance is at 3850 W 102nd St, Inglewood, CA 90303. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LAClippers/comments/1i5ewfi/comment/m8bq0b8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). They tend to fill the garages from the top going down, so if you arrive early, there's a chance you'll be parking at the top floors. EV parking is plentiful and free at intuit dome garages.

[Red line is the Prairie exit coming from the east. Cars coming from the west will be the yellow and blue lines and many drivers are reluctant to let cars from the red line in to their lane to turn left, thus causing a lot of traffic at this exit.](https://preview.redd.it/9p4vnvo5o4fe1.png?width=2966&format=png&auto=webp&s=485c837a5517ff9be38dc8a0cf0bf190bf0fcd26)

[EV charging is free, just need the Shell Recharge App. Many level 2 chargers available at each level.](https://preview.redd.it/blvrallbq4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=646c15bbc7df70bd807fb0ef8bcc36fc1fbb5f6c)

***In-event:***

**1. Entering the arena's VIP section**

If you're coming from the west garage, you'll take a bridge that'll lead you to Clipper's plaza. There's three entrances: one big general entrance for main/terrace sections, a VIP entrance, and one entrance for wall members. The VIP entrance is comparable to the star plaza VIP entrance of staples center, as its completely separate from the main concourse and you'll be led straight to the VIP club and floor levels. If you park in the player's garage, there is a private security/entrance there for those who park there, and you are a small walk away from the elevators/escalators that bring you to where you are seated at the VIP club and floor levels. If you have gameface ID, you can just walk through the entrance after an usher clears you at a checkpoint. If you opt out of gameface ID, you'll scan your identity pass from your phone's wallet or smart watch at said checkpoint. You'll then take the escalator down two floors to the floor section and you'll be greeted with ushers who will point you to the direction of your seat and the lounges you have access to.

[Floor level of Intuit Dome](https://preview.redd.it/shiyz94jg4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdbfc15e52d25a66c60c61a29a69cfaadaf996f0)

[Floor level hallways are shared with bungalow suites](https://preview.redd.it/9ig8ine9k4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b004e5730ab4ea6dc417f2c38d6059624c171783)

[Ushers at every corner to ensure you don't get lost.](https://preview.redd.it/go6p1qpik4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69fa1474bfa59db7d6c79a52b5e0e9daab9e9e4c)

**Tip**: Enable express mode on your Identity pass on your phone or smart watch so you don't have to scroll through your phone wallet's credit cards and other passes. This way, you just need to hold up your phone or watch up to the scanner and it will scan you in, regardless if your phone is locked.

[Map overlay of the different lounges available. These are underneath the general seating areas.](https://preview.redd.it/6ezqx535j4fe1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=c605565098c83d46585430e52836d70179ee404c)

**2. Lounges and concessions**

There are two all-inclusive lounges I visited, the US bank and the red lounge, at the time of this writing. Used to be called north and south red lounge but US bank bought the naming rights I guess to the other lounge. The two lounges have the same offerings so it doesn't matter too much which one you go to. You'll find premium offerings such as sushi, roast beef, pot pie on one end and classic concessions like hot dogs, pizza, etc. on the other end. In between the two food sections, you'll have a bar with free alcohol for those 21+. Canned drinks of coke products line the walls to grab and go and there's another walled section for more alcoholic beverages. If you want more food selections/eating areas, you can go a floor up to the club level or main level concessions. Ushers just told me to scan my identity pass at the checkpoints so the systems know I'm from the floor level and so I wouldn't be charged for anything as long as it was food or non-alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages, I was told, was only free for me at the floor level lounges.

**3. Seating and viewing experience**

There isn't a bad viewing angle from the floor section. Even sitting at the far left or right floor sections, you'll still see majority of the game with minimal stanchion interference. The legroom in this section is the most I've experienced and rightfully so, as Ballmer has been promoting that as a key feature in this new arena. If you aren't a big fella like me, you can squeeze your legs in to let people pass thru the row but even if you need to stand up, the seats fold back a good amount so you just need to stand and lean back a bit, not needing to do any awkward movements I used to have to do back at Staples. Row D, the first row behind the 3 closest courtside rows, starts a little bit elevated, which I think is a nice touch that helps see more of the court beyond the huge players sitting on the bench.

[I'm 6'0 and have plenty of legroom.](https://preview.redd.it/9uegsor1g4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c21a19045a66aa2ecb3f88748ec96ec831e02b9)

[Floor section 30, row J](https://preview.redd.it/f1t50tytk4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80b701fe386eca2e17b4577a6dbc3cd40501e5f5)

[Floor Section 8, row J](https://preview.redd.it/h3jtrb3vk4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86b4093b5b544a81ff8b2c80aeddff3011f4fb94)

Alright let's talk the the elephant in the room, that big ass halo screen above your head. It's definitely nice, like a smaller version of the one across the street. It gives a lot of information throughout the game and sometimes during timeouts, you can play games with others in the arena. There's LED lights at every armrest, which gets me reminiscent of when they used to hand out LED wrist bands at staples. And a USB-C port as well if you need to charge your phone during the game. The audio and visuals are top notch and there's very little I would change about the seats.

[Minimal plastic in this arena, aluminum or paper is used for cups and plates](https://preview.redd.it/54htqcr1k4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d907d3cca0dffe653f03787784cf18a2c4b189a)

***Post-event:***

**1. Leaving the arena**

After the game, you're encouraged to exit through the main concourse if your section has a stairway to it. You can exit through the same VIP way you came through but they try to limit people going that way as they close the lounges down and turn that into meeting places for friends and families of the clippers and opposing team players. Note this is a separate ""event"" and even has its own ticket I assume the players give directly, so if you're trying to sneak in claiming to be Kawhi's long lost cousin trying to meet the fun guy post-game, you're out of luck. If you parked at the west garage and at any of the other third party lots in that direction, you'll be exiting through the big general entrance. If you parked at the player's garage, remember the hallway you entered as you'll be exiting through that way as well.

**2. Getting on the road**

Player's garage has the least traffic leaving the stadium as its the least capacity filled garage and you can cut through the residential streets instead of getting on Century or Prairie. Exercise patience leaving the west garage as it can take quite a while getting out depending on what floor you parked on. I've been able to leave the stadium and be on the freeway in 10 minutes from the player's garage and in 15 minutes leaving the first floor of the west garage, although people who have parked up in higher floors say it can take up to 30-40 minutes just to leave the parking garage alone.

***Final thoughts:***

There's some questionable design choices I have of the arena but I think whoever designed it did a pretty good job with the space they were allotted with. From the outside looking in, I wish Ballmer expanded the west parking garage to the intersection and bought out the liquor store and Starbucks, but I guess no amount of money was gonna get them to move. And the east parking garage is inconveniently a block east of the arena. I'd probably be more forgiving of that lone parking structure but at a steep $58 per car, I'd rather spend the extra $10 and park in the west garage if I had to choose between the two.

There's a lot of similarities arena-wise to Chase Center, from the plaza outside the arena and the club/floor level VIP offerings they have to offer. One thing Chase and Staples Center get right is transit options to the arena are plentiful. I know it will cost a lot of money but a connection to the C or K line would help provide transportation options to those who live close and have access to those lines, and it'll benefit Hollywood Park and Sofi stadium as well.

While the app gets many things right, it can also be improved. I came with a group of international people my first time and it was hard setting up Intuit Dome accounts for them because they didn't have a US-phone number to verify their account, so I ended up having to make 5 teammate accounts for them. I get bots are a thing and they don't want to overload their servers with unverified accounts, but there has to be another way to make an intuit dome account without a US phone number for those who may be traveling from abroad.

The food experience is great as it is, but this can also be better. If expanding seating arrangements can't be done due to limited space, they should include more mobile-friendly containers so people can grab the food and enjoy it in their seats. They already do a great job with this with the pizza containers and hot dogs. Put some larger containers out instead of those tiny plates Ballmer so I can take more of that southwestern pot pie out to my seat! As much as I enjoy having everything free in the arena at the floor level and other levels as well, one thing I miss from the Staples center at that VIP level was in-seat service. It was great having food/drink delivered to my seat without needing to go to the lounge, especially during the game when timeouts are short and the action is going.

[Food is allegedly free in these concession stands if you are from the floor level. Scan your identity pass at the checkpoints so the system knows you are from the floor level.](https://preview.redd.it/ru0uxt28l4fe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffd1b25855f01b257644ce8214afd35f9671ec0b)

Drawing my past life.,starseeds,1i9kzki,2025-01-25 06:25:39,101,0.98,25,https://i.redd.it/nisjm4mik4fe1.jpeg,One_Two_Three_Go11,,"Hello everyone! I wasn’t really quite active in this community, but i am back! ( or, as much as i can, anyway. )

Today, i wanted to share something a little bit different, for a little bit of story telling as well:

I have found out about my past life in second July of 2024. I have gone with my mother to a shaman-scientist that is well trusted in my country to get him to check us up. ( long story short, there was an advanced device there that can detect in your auras, chakras etc what you have that needed to be repaired. )

Anyway, back to the subject — we also noticed that he does hypnosis for past lives. I was curious, since i wanted to know who i was.

We got started and he guided me towards a profound meditation where i saw my past life.

Words can’t describe what emotions i felt during the session, i think the proper word is called “ catharsis “. But it was very overwhelming, my whole body was shaking and i couldn’t stay still.

What i saw was that i noticed that i was in Ancient Egypt. There was sand and i looked down, my feet were light blue, along with my whole body.

When i starred in front of me, i saw the Pyramids, but it had a more ethereal look to it. I could remember there was a blue circle around them with a powerful light on the sky. 

My hands were positioned in the air, straight, with my palms pointed up at the sky. But when i looked around..

There were *thousands*. And i mean, *thousands* of other galactic beings, but some were different. I couldn’t see the whole thing, but a bunch of them ( including me ) were making a really big circle around the pyramids, as if we were activating them somehow, or in the process of the finishing of the pyramids.

When i looked down again, my clothing was white with golden symbols on it, it was kind of a robe type of thing with long sleeves and such. I do remember i was pretty tall ( or felt pretty tall ). I also seemed pretty androgynous and didn’t feel a specific feminine or masculine energy.

But, the whole thing.. the collective energy was extremely overwhelming, therefore, my 3D body was experiencing it as well, hence the shaking and my eyes rapidly flicking as well.

The scientist had to take me out of there fast, since this whole phenomenon can be dangerous when staying for it too long.

I ended up sobbing my eyes out after the session. During the session, he did ask me where i was, who i was etc.. though i couldn’t really say something properly since i felt my heart in my chest, and my cries were already interrupting the speech.


————

Thank you for whoever listened to my rambling and took their time to witness the drawing. This is a treasured moment for me, however i felt the need to share it with someone to get it off my chest somehow.

I feel blessed to know one of my past lives, so i am trying my best to understand it, therefore i artistically expressed myself here.

During the drawing, i mostly payed attention to what felt right, so it is not really my best artwork, but it did help me understand further and get used to the idea!

Sending you Love and Light. ❤️✨"
Ideas for r/Classic Trance Contests/Competitions from 2025,ClassicTrance,1i9kod4,2025-01-25 06:03:14,4,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicTrance/comments/1i9kod4/ideas_for_rclassic_trance_contestscompetitions/,junh1024,Discussion,"### Introduction
CT contests have been a bit uncreative lately focusing solely on numbers & years, so I have decided to use my experience to come up with good contest themes

Contests based on numbers feel like Morgana Robinson in Taskmaster COC3 with both hands tied behind her back with a certain German fuhrer shouting ""YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO USE TRACKS FROM 1944, 1934, AND 1924. So you need to DJ with your foot. It's quite restrictive. On the contrary, if you have a contest which is based on vibes, it's like Kiell Smith-Bynoe with one hand in his pocket, so you need to DJ with one hand. It's quite doable.

People are encouraged to discuss these ideas, and post your contest ideas below. Ideas can be added/changed at any time. 

### Default rules

A couple of small adjustments to default rules for clarity and fairness purposes. These can be discussed below also.

- Your mix must not be released prior to this contest
- Anonymous submission, and fair criticism
- Maximum length is 80 mins with a leeway of 1 min (allows burning to audio CD) **small change**
- Keep it classic please, tracks from 2008 or earlier (unless otherwise specified)
- Must be >= 50% trance   (unless otherwise specified) **clarified**



### Classic House In Da House!

- Aim: Make a Classic House mix.
- Genre rules: >= 50% must be be house or have a strong house feeling
- Ideal timing: not immediately after or before no trance allowed.
- Notes: The classic house definition from r-houseclassics is raised to 2008 when this contest is deployed, any further raises to classic trance (example, raising the CT definition to 2010 in 2030), r-houseclassics will follow in lockstep.


### No Trance Allowed!

- Aim: Make a mix that has no trance in it
- Ideal timing: not immediately before or after classic House. Deployed around Feb-Mar so listening can be in April (April Fools)
- Notes: the organiser can decide whether to allow borderline genres like trouse or Eurodance. 

### Video Games

- Aim: is to make a mix of music inspired by video games, or would work well in such a game. A game or game series must be in your mix title, and must somehow represent your mix. Mix titles will carry through to voting, collisions are handled with appending a number. Examples: A Need For Speed mix of techno, A Ridge Racer mix of psytrance, etc
- Genre: General Electronic
- Notes: organiser can decide to require a song from a video game  (composed or licensed). They can also expand the genre to include all genres.

### Ghost Of Contests Past
- Aim: Make a mix where >=2 of your tracks were used in a previous classic trance contest. You must provide evidence, for example, links to previous mix TLs that specific track has been used in a previous contest. Editing past comments or materials may void your proof. If you are remaking a mix, TL & in order should be substantially different in order to keep it fresh. 
- Ideal timing: end of year
- Notes: organizer can increased req'd past tracks to make it harder

### Treasure Hunt
- Aim: participants must use a song title with the first letter of their reddit username, plus 2 more letters that will be announced when the contest starts. The letters can occur in any order in the song title. If there are repeats in the letters, then your song title must also have at least the same number of repeats. Remix title does not count. Foreign songs allowed, romanized title will be used for qualification, using the most common modern romanization method.
- Notes: specific extra letter announced would impact difficulty choosing a song. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency 

Activate was not listed as a theme since it's quite difficult at 99% and would result in  similar TLs as the selection is very small.  (difficulty is defined as: someone with a collection of trance from 1995-2015 will have to throw out N% of tracks). A few ideas also weren't presented here due to increased logistical Burden on the organizers, or not being a very good theme since it's a bit troll like."
Nail Trends to Watch in 2025: From Mocha Mousse to Dazzling Metallics,nailsartindia,1i9kgaq,2025-01-25 05:47:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nailsartindia/comments/1i9kgaq/nail_trends_to_watch_in_2025_from_mocha_mousse_to/,Friendly-Tie8662,,"As we step into 2025, the world of nail art is poised for an exciting transformation.

Here’s a detailed look at the nail trends that are set to dominate in 2025.

# 1. Mocha Mousse: The Color of the Year

Pantone has declared **Mocha Mousse** as the Color of the Year for 2025, and it’s making waves in the nail industry.

Nail artist Mazz Hanna describes Mocha Mousse as a ""natural fit for a year focused on simplicity and warmth,"" making it an ideal choice for those looking to add a touch of elegance to their manicures. Expect to see this shade in various finishes, from glossy to matte, as it complements both casual and formal looks.

# 2. Cat Eye Nails: A Mesmerizing Comeback

One of the most captivating trends returning this year is **cat eye nails**. This style creates a stunning optical illusion using magnetic polish, resulting in a glassy, velvet-like effect that shifts with light. Searches for cat eye nails have skyrocketed by 5,000%, indicating its rising popularity. Celebrity nail artist Iram Shelton notes that this trend allows for intricate designs while still being accessible for at-home experimentation. Whether you opt for classic colors or vibrant hues, cat eye nails are sure to make a statement.

# 3. Bold Colors: A Shift from Neutrality

After a year dominated by muted tones and minimalist designs, 2025 is all about **bold colors**. Expect to see vibrant shades such as cobalt blue, deep red, and even metallics taking center stage. Shelton emphasizes that people are moving away from beige and embracing more colorful expressions in their lives—nails included. This trend encourages individuals to experiment with different colors and find what resonates with their style.

# 4. 3D Nail Art: Elevating the Manicure Experience

**3D nail art** is another trend set to explode this year.

As people seek more fun and expressive options for their nails, styles like aura nails and animal prints are making a comeback. This trend encourages experimentation with various patterns and textures, allowing individuals to push their boundaries and express their creativity through nail design.

# 6. Glossy Glass Nails: A Chic Finish

The **glossy glass finish**, reminiscent of the popular glazed donut trend from previous years, continues to be favored in 2025. This look can be achieved with sheer polishes or high-shine topcoats that give nails an ethereal quality. Pastel shades will dominate this style, offering a fresh take on classic manicures while maintaining an air of sophistication.

# 7. Iridescent Textures: Shimmering Surfaces

Expect **iridescent textures** to shine in 2025 as well. These finishes provide a mesmerizing effect that changes color depending on the angle of light. Nail artists predict that this trend will allow individuals to maintain their favorite colors while introducing exciting new effects that elevate their overall look.

# 8. Soap Nails: The Spa-Inspired Trend

**Soap nails** are another trend gaining traction this year, characterized by their pristine appearance reminiscent of a luxurious spa experience. This style focuses on achieving a clean, high-shine finish that feels fresh and polished. Nail enthusiasts can achieve this look by using specific tools like glass nail buffers before applying polish."

Hunter 350 vs Gixxer SF 250,indianbikes,1i9kcne,2025-01-25 05:40:03,19,0.95,31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9kcne,soopersak,#Query  ❓,"Hello friends, please help me decide between these two bikes. I understand that they are very different from each other, but that’s making the decision even harder. Both are priced around the same in my city ~2.3 lakh. I am a new rider, and both seem like good beginner options. My priority is safety, reliability, and comfort. I will be using it for very short commutes to the office (only 6km round trip) and to visit restaurants, cafes, etc in the evening. So it will be 90% city riding and 10% highway riding once my skills advance.

Hunter 350 Pros
-clean retro styling
-good torque for city rides
-lovely exhaust note

Hunter 350 Cons
-all reviews say rear suspension is too stiff and uncomfortable
-not that good for highway touring
-lighter than Classic 350 but still 20kg heavier than Gixxer SF 250

Gixxer SF 250 Pros
-modern design, all digital instruments and LED lights
-very light and maneuverable for city traffic (161kg)
-sexy sportbike look, less common on roads than Hunter for exclusivity
-much more highway capable than Hunter

Gixxer SF 250 Cons
-small pillion seat (not really a problem for me, I’m a single Redditor 😂)
-frequent maintenance intervals 
-many reviews mention poor after-sales support and lack of spare part availability 

Common Points on Both Bikes
-disc brakes with dual ABS
-17” alloys
-navigation screen (if I opt for tripper)
-similar mileage ~36kmpl
-same price

I’m leaning towards the Gixxer slightly due to its lower weight and highway capabilities, but the Hunter’s exhaust and retro look are pulling on my heartstrings. Can anyone here who has ridden/owned one or both of these bikes help me out? Thank you in advance."

In 2023, I decided to take the plunge and blind buy Joop Homme (after doing some basic Googling) for a special winter wedding. When I first tried it, my reaction was... well, intense. I thought to myself, ""Goddamn, this fragrance is evil!"" It was so strong that just one or two sprays would last an entire day. Honestly, it was a bold choice, considering how polarizing its scent can be. Over time, though, it grew on me, and now I kind of enjoy it.

That experience made me wonder why I shouldn’t try a few more ""decent"" perfumes. Being new to this world at the time, I thought you had to blind buy an entire bottle, which made me hesitant. But towards the end of 2024, I stumbled upon a few articles about testers, discovery kits, and decants, which opened up a whole new perspective for me. While exploring, I found this subreddit through Google, and now here I am—pockets empty—writing this post after what I feel is a (probably stupidly) massive haul.

Not in the picture, but I also own Jaguar Classic, Black Gold by Notre, and Theoreme EDP by Rue Broca (ordered but not yet arrived).

Here’s my haul, and I’d love your critique, suggestions, and thoughts on what you think is a safe full-bottle purchase based on my discovery kits. So far, I’ve only tried Skinn’s Raw, Steele, Verge, and Marine. I loved all of them except for Steele.

   - Eau Tres Fraiche
   - EDT
   - Eau Intense Vetiver
   - Parfum (Pure Perfume)

2. Initio
   - Musk Therapy

This is where you create fictional online content (or even print media) as if it were real. 

The classic example is the marketing for The Blair Witch Project where an entire fiction was created including flyers distributed in local markets creating the illusion that the filmmakers were really students that went missing. Millions fell for it. 

Then there's the marketing for the movie Cloverfield. The movie about the giant monster attacking New York City. Not only was there a fictional drink called Slusho involved (Slosho also appeared in Lost and the X-Files), but the characters in the movie had Myspace pages as if they were real people.

Blogging can be an element incorporated into alternate reality. You can blog as if you were a fictional character. 

As a matter of fact this is evocative of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. Dracula is written as a series of diary entries, newspaper clippings, ship manifests, Captain's logs etc... 

In fact I'm wondering if anyone has ever created prop artifacts of each of the elements of the novel. 

This has is all come up this morning because I was just followed on Bluesky by @jennipowell.bsky.social who created lonelygirl15. If you don't know who she is look her up.

Opinions on The Libertines ‘Up The Bracket’ album remaster,audioengineering,1i9jtvy,2025-01-25 05:01:35,3,0.71,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1i9jtvy/opinions_on_the_libertines_up_the_bracket_album/,inkyoctopuz31,,"Now, I know this band and their music are not to everyone’s liking, but if we can employ a bit of objectivity to the subject… for context; when I was a teenager, I adored this band - and this album was a shining jewel in this era, alongside records by The Strokes, Kings Of Leon, The Cribs, The Coral etc, it was a really exciting time to be a kid (kind of the last hoorah of the 20th Century music biz), and I played this CD to death, i’ve owned 3 copies and can play pretty much every instrument for every song, nuances and all, I was obsessed. So, the 20 Year Anniversary came around and they released a “remastered” version of the album. Understandable concept, it’s a lofi, rough and ready album, live, warts and all takes, minimal overdubs, lots of air and room resonance in the mix, but quite upfront, abrasive guitars - I could see how a remaster would have room to play here, maybe rebalance the instruments, add some extra punch and I was pretty excited. Now, if anyone who isn’t familiar with this record can be arsed to go have a listen on whichever streaming service they hate the least, just go do an A/B comparison of the original mix and the remaster. 

Personally, I find it unlistenable - imagine my - not so much disappointment - just confusion! It’s quieter for sure, and there’s some odd panning that’s been applied, but the most obvious thing is that this isn’t a remaster, it’s a different mix altogether, and a far FAR inferior mix at that, the lead song, Vertigo seems disjointed, out of time, lacking energy, muffled, very demo-like - the original is ramshackle but it’s got all the punky energy it needs to kickstart a whole music culture, if this remixed version had been put out I honestly don’t think it would’ve had anywhere near the same impact. Who the hell green lit this? It’s that classic case of sounding like someone who didn’t do their homework and rushed it last minute to hit the deadline. I wrote this in response to a post talking about “demo-itis”, am I just so familiar with the original that any changes are gonna sound weird, or am I right in thinking this remaster is really bad? Opinions and thoughts please and thanks! 😁

Edit: I just had a quick relisten myself - they’ve actually changed the album on Apple Music, the mixes are different now, but then the differences are pretty insignificant, I suppose more in line with an actual remaster, a bit of eq and compression from what I can tell, but seems a bit unnecessary now - so to change the question slightly, did anyone hear the mixes I spoke of and know what i’m talking about? 😅 "
I told my fiance that he needs to stop treating his daughter like a toddler.,AITAH,1i9jrm1,2025-01-25 04:57:03,110,0.89,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9jrm1/i_told_my_fiance_that_he_needs_to_stop_treating/,ZombyBumble,,"I dont have kids so maybe I shouldn't be having such a strong opinion about this situation. 
So I met my fiancé's daughter when she was 5y/o. I didnt notice anything at first but the older she gets the more ive started seeing things that he does that might be negatively affecting her ability to be more independent and things like this.
Now that his daughter is almost 7 years old it's more obvious to me that she still does baby talk... like her pronunciation and even her Tone and body language. And I wondered if it could be a speech impediment or something... either way I knew it was a little strange because my best friends neice is 6 and she speaks very well. 
I started paying more attention and noticed how my fiance also spoke to her in baby voice... i became concerned that maybe he was negatively affecting her speech development... that was until the creepiest thing happened one day when he left to get something from the store and it was just me and her.
When we were alone she spoke completely normal! At first I couldn't put my finger on it but I could tell that something was different about her. And then it hit me. I asked her a little bit about it not trying to influence her answers. Essentially she explained that she didn't want to make her daddy sad so she would speak differently.
I had noticed other things about his behavior with her coupled with the fact that I heard him say the classic, ""you arent allowed to grow up"" things that I didn't bat an eye at because it was just a cute thing that parents say. But the more I thought about it and the more I watched the more concerned I became.
Things like still wiping her bottom after the bathroom (if that's normal at this age please tell me I'm ignorant but it seemed like she was too old for that) dressing her completely (shoes and socks i get that but all the clothes?), not having boundaries when it came to knocking before entering our bedroom, not throwing her candy wrappers in the trashcan just leaving them on the floor, not letting her try and help me in the kitchen with cracking eggs or letting her explore her abilities and he just generally doing every little thing for her etc...
Overall she is extremely well behaved and kind and generous beautiful girl. None of these things are her fault. One day we were at some family thing on my side of the family and my mom mentioned something to me about the lack of independence and that for me was all i needed. 
I decided to talk to him about letting her try things so that she can build her confidence and stop talking to her like she is a baby... you get it. I'm glad to say that now she wipes herself, she puts on her shirts and pants and jackets, he explained boundaries regarding the bedroom door and knocking first, she's allowed cracks eggs with me now and she always wants to mix whatever and yes it's a mess sometimes but i believe it's good for her to learn and discover things. 
I'm just not sure if I was in the right to suggest she should be more independent and was maybe behind her peers. I was doing my own laundry by her age because my mom valued that sort of thing in me and my brother. I mean she is only 6... idk was I projecting my own idea of expectations based on my upbringing? Was I being unfair? Are those normal behaviors for an almost 7 year old?"
Nikola Tesla's Wireless Power Transmission Is Possible - Free Energy,plasma_pi,1i9jljk,2025-01-25 04:44:13,5,0.78,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/plasma_pi/comments/1i9jljk/nikola_teslas_wireless_power_transmission_is/,RecognitionNovap,,"A historical hypothesis suggests that more than 500 years ago the old world had no sun and moon. It was the world of Heaven, where the creature representing the earth was half human and half God. This was the old world that really collapsed completely. The sun and the moon were then formed in different regions. About 200 years ago, in 1802, the sun and the moon began to be created with the north pole (known today) as the center of the flat earth, surrounded by ice shelves. Today's world has 2 domes, one of which is the ice dome closest to humans.

That is the hypothesis of Gorgi Shepentulevski in the book [UNDER THE DOME](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tartaria_KJ/comments/1hwgotb/tartaria_where_is_the_real_ice_dome_the_world/). All the problems of the flat earth, where is the ice dome, etc. are all linked at the end of this article ""[Is there a Civilization beyond the Ice Shelf?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tartaria_KJ/comments/1hxekeu/tartaria_is_there_a_civilization_beyond_the_ice/)""

Those interested in electrical technology may not care about that historical issue. I mention it just to open up another issue, Tesla's wireless electricity and its feasibility.

When I think of the old world, without the sun, only the aurora borealis from the sky, in the heavenly world, with buildings that can also generate electricity, I think of Tesla's wireless electricity transmission technology.

[Tesla's receiver with \\"" AND \\"" circuit as a part of his multicarrier system  ](https://preview.redd.it/zvm76x5hh3fe1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b6cd321104adb9896d403f0412e136a5df9a7ad)

With the above circuit, buildings can apply it to generate electricity for lighting, but without the violent movement of gasoline-powered AC generators sold today. With this system, one active receiver will lead to the other to do the same. They work together.

In particular, it can be designed to collect energy from a tower, as a power station for the whole world. And so, small wireless power receivers have two sources of power: The source from the main transmitter and the nearby source it generates reciprocally.

[Wardenclyffe Tower \(Long Island\) in 1903](https://preview.redd.it/ryrp5tvdi3fe1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=830ec348740134bc94f676d4565dd4bb3d2ed9b6)

Pictured above is the Tesla Tower (Wardenclyffe), which has many purposes. It can support weapons, remote control, and transmit electricity. The Wardenclyffe Tower (Long Island) with Tesla technology can do that.

**Free Energy**: With the above system, the same receivers will always receive the same amount of electricity, regardless of the number of receivers. For example: If the Wardenclyffe Tower emits electricity with a capacity of 2000 W, and there are 50 wireless energy receivers with a capacity of 1000 W, then the receivers will get enough electricity, in total we have 50,000 W generated from 2000 W of the tower. That is wireless power transmission technology, but potentially Free Energy.

[Left: Once free energy is obtained, it needs to be transmitted wirelessly | Right: wireless energy collection](https://preview.redd.it/w9drfzzlk3fe1.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5c64bae0dcfad2b4120d064a404975c0efb0e77)

If Nikola Tesla's wireless power transmission is feasible, and is free energy, this leads to many historical and technological issues that need to be reconsidered. For example: The existence of the old world (Sacred Tartaria) and the existence of Nikola Tesla need to be reconsidered.

# # A technology similar to Nikola Tesla

American electrical engineer Frank Wyatt Prentice invented what he described as an 'Electric Accumulator' with an output power six times greater than the input power (COP = 6). He was granted a patent in 1923, which reads:

*In the course of developing my WIRELESS TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM for railways, covered by my United States Patent No. 843,550, I have found that with an antenna consisting of a wire of suitable diameter supported on insulators, three to six inches above the ground and extending about half a mile, more or less, the antenna being grounded at one end across a spark gap and energized at the other end by a high-frequency generator having an input power of 500 watts and a secondary frequency of 500,000 Hz, will produce in the antenna an oscillating frequency identical to that of the ground current and, consequently, the ambient electromagnetic energy is accumulated along the length of the transmitting antenna and with an oscillating loop antenna An 18-foot long closed loop running parallel to the transmitting antenna at a distance of about 20 feet, which can be obtained by adjusting the loop antenna, has enough power to light a series of fifty sixty-watt carbon lamps. Lowering or raising the frequency of 500,000 Hz results in a reduction in the amount of power received through the 18-foot antenna.*

[United States Letters Patent Number 843,550](https://preview.redd.it/1nai6jwfm3fe1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=129af93108ee2028ef46b1277dfa04a213b98687)

The internal independent supply represents the high-frequency transformer with special coil \(Source: Popovic Vojin, Nikola Tesla – From Colorado Springs to Long Island.

[Similarities between the 2 technologies: Frank Prentice's pulse antenna system and Tesla's new version of the transmitter at Wardenclyffe.](https://preview.redd.it/3ll2929qm3fe1.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=23c5d32f97803b0495a6849041cb7ca1d9afad4e)

Nikola Tesla did not explain the circuit above and there is no application because the Wardenclyffe tower was demolished in 1917. Much is not hidden, it remains in the records and physical evidence. The problem is to consider the history of technology: It is possible that some records are lies or half-truths - which is obvious.

# # Is Nikola Tesla's Free Energy Technology Feasible?

If Frank Prentice's COP=6 Pulse Antenna System is feasible, and has actually been experimentally proven, then wireless power transmission with Free Energy really works!

Similar technology to Frank Wyatt Prentice's has been proven to work on some free energy forums (Overuniy), but now the forums are closed for some reason.

I searched on Youtube but did not find anyone demonstrating a device similar to Frank Wyatt Prentice's. However, Frank Wyatt Prentice's device and Tesla Transformer are essentially the same as the main technique in Tesla coil and Ewin Gray's Electromagnetic Radiation technology.

Tesla's famous invention is the ""Tesla coil"", technically called the Tesla Transformer. In fact, both the Tesla Tower and Frank Prentice's system are based on the principle of the Tesla Transformer (Tesla coil) with a sudden interruption (stop) technique that leads to disturbances in the Ether field, creating an unbalanced state in the Ether. The Ether field itself is always trying to balance the states in it, creating transient voltage and current increases (displacement of the dielectric field) for a short time. The spark gap of the Tesla coil is the tool that suddenly interrupts (breaks the circuit) for the electric circuit. Only the Ether theory can explain why the Tesla coil increases the voltage and frequency of the applied electric oscillations. *Note that: High voltage is evident in the Tesla coil, but the large current intensity that can be seen by measurement requires a conversion from longitudinal to transverse displacement of the Ether field.*

The Tesla coil also produces free energy and can be used as a means of transmitting electricity wirelessly, literally. If the Tesla coil produces free energy, then Frank Prentice's system and Tesla tower also produce Free Energy.

**We have at least 1 testimony for the working of this technology from Frank Wyatt Prentice!** If Frank Prentice is being honest, then Tesla's Free Energy actually works. The technology is not popular probably because many people who are capable of explaining this technology do not want to talk about this on the internet.

# # You can test this technology simply with coaxial cable

I have a detailed tutorial on creating a device to harvest Radiant Energy from conductors by Frank Prentice. You can review the diagram above and then look at the following diagram:

[Radiant energy is harvested from wires with coaxial cable - like Tesla's wireless power transmission but at a closer range.](https://preview.redd.it/3kahj6vqs3fe1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba2dd7f8672199539a1f74c68e3187d6b572ea4a)

**The full tutorial is here**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/plasma\_pi/comments/1g25oet/exploiting\_radiant\_energy\_on\_electrical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/plasma_pi/comments/1g25oet/exploiting_radiant_energy_on_electrical/) = Exploiting Radiant Energy on Electrical Conductors - Free Energy from Electrical Circuits

If you are using a closed loop oscillator antenna, see the following diagram (original version):

[Frank Prentice's original version uses a closed loop antenna.](https://preview.redd.it/vplaza7nt3fe1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa5b1830bd40624c7da929e154588d60a8a20bc4)

With the caveat that:

The return of current through the earth from transmission antenna **19**, is preferable to return through a wire as the ground return current picks up more earth currents than a wire does. I also prefer under certain conditions, to use a single antenna wire in place of the closed loop antenna shown in **Fig.2**

[the circuit converts the pulse voltage from the antenna to use](https://preview.redd.it/itx6hhryt3fe1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=4edc4bdbd1f14af5c274575d76649bd4228c61ab)

Under certain operational requirements, I have had improved performance by having the transmission antenna elevated and carried on poles many feet above the earth, and with that arrangement it is necessary to use a different voltage and frequency in order to accumulate earth currents.

This system of Frank’s effectively applies very sharply pulsed DC pulses to a long length of wire supported in a horizontal position not far above the ground.   The pulses are sharp due to both the spark gap on the primary side of the transformer, along with the spark-gap on the secondary (high voltage) side of the transformer.   An input power of 500 watts gives a 3 kW power output from what appears to be an incredibly simple piece of equipment.

# # Wireless power technology with free electricity and doubts

What I told about Frank Prentice above mentioned ""WIRELESS TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM"" - advanced technology. Many historical researchers believe that advanced technology once appeared in the old world (Tartaria).

**Doubt**: Technology from the older world over 500 years ago on [the ice shelf of the flat earth](https://energy-medicine-blog.blogspot.com/p/flat-earth-map-north-pole-model-moving.html), was transferred to the present world since the 19th century.

The above suspicion is based on the following observation:

* The possibility of 2 people coming up with inventions of the same technological nature is very rare, unless they are trained by the same education and the same teacher. More precisely, if two people read the same basic and universal book of electrical physics, then those two people will be able to invent the same technology.
* Another possibility is that NIkola Tesla was real, but his history is fictional, and Tesla's inventions were compiled by a mysterious force. This force is even beyond the ice shelf (outside the world of flat Earth).
* When Nikola Tesla died at the hotel, the Office of Alien Property came to take away the documents. Then Donald Trump's uncle, John G. Trump, was present. That means there is a possibility: Donald Trump, John G. Trump, and ""Alien"" are all allies.
* That is the question that needs to be investigated about aliens and the origin of humanity and historical truth. We need to know whether the Secular side in the history of Tartaria is good or bad. If they are hypocrites, they will have a way to program people's minds to believe that they are for the good of humanity. Remember, humanity was destroyed by a war between two sides: secular authority and divine authority. **I am not sure Donald Trump belongs to the divine side**.

The future destiny is not entirely decided by 2 sides, but also depends on a 3rd side, the ""character in the Game"" - this side is the masses, including each individual in the masses. Therefore, our destiny can be decided by each individual if they know in advance. That is the rule of the game that the Koran mentioned when Allah let the individual choose his own path. **For example**: *""And say, 'The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills—let him believe; and whoever wills—let him disbelieve.' Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like molten metal, which scalds faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.""* \- Koran.

That means that the destiny of an individual can be different from the common destiny of the majority of humanity. Because the rules of the game allow it.

In addition, NikolaTesla's technology is suspected by historical investigators to be the technology of the old world (Tartaria). But when was the old technology, few historians dare to be sure.

Based on the revelations from the investigations of historians such as [David Ewing Jr, Anatoly Fomenko](https://infinite-energy-generator.blogspot.com/p/tartaria-electric-creature-cold.html), Gorgi [Shepentulevski](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tartaria_Re/comments/1hrzvgz/tracing_the_origin_of_the_flat_earth_map_with_a/), I found that the real old world technology was before 1500. A recent information revealed related to [Tartaria 33 degrees ](https://amzn.to/4h1zUrz)and Science of the Kaaba by David Ewing Jr. about the origin of humans: [Mud Flood: Alien Invasion (David Ewing Jr.)](https://youtu.be/Dww4w6VBDEM)

Frank Prentice's own invention is related to the old world Tartaria and is similar to Nikola Tesla's, so it is worth considering the question: [Is the history of Nikola Tesla a fiction?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tartaria_KJ/comments/1hpr7hc/tartaria_is_nikola_tesla_fiction_summary_of_the/)

[Imagination: The old world of Tartaria before 1500 and Free Energy in Paradise](https://preview.redd.it/wcrimdv8y3fe1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f212dc1f7d5aae4d5c6db74017e4dabaab91a134)

If the old world as pictured above exists, then we have only appeared about 500 years, and our social structure has only been shaped in the last 200 years. Investigating this is very important, because it is related to war, fraud, and the deepest conspiracy related to human origin. Recent investigation: We are aliens who fell here. If that is true, [Donald Trump](https://amzn.to/3E6R0Wu) along with the [19 codes](https://amzn.to/4ju83lw) of the secular side in human history (Tartaria) are related to other aliens!  Which faction does Donald Trump belong to? And is he an alien force? The answer is in the book: [Tartaria - Science of the Kaaba](https://amzn.to/4avUePw).

**\* My personal opinion on the issue: Is Donald Trump a Secular Alien or is he a Divine being more than 1000 years ago?**

*\[ Code 19 appears in modern history a lot, including the* [history of Donald Trump](https://amzn.to/3E6R0Wu)*. This is a sign of manipulation by mysterious ""alien"" forces!*

*Look back at the history investigated by Anatoly Fomenko and David Ewing Jr., humanity has been miserable for the past 500 years, humanity has had to eat clay, does not know the language, is deceived into war, etc.*

*The recent life of humans, although 95% of the population is poor compared to the elite, but life is still much better than 40 years ago.*

*So do you think that the Divine Authority faction in the ranks of the world's rulers has contributed to making the world better? I'm not sure how much influence they have, but their role does exist.*

*If the Secularists take over the New World Order, then history, like the last 500 years, and even the last 1000 years (from 1053 - according to* [Gorgi Shepentulevski](https://www.reddit.com/r/FringeTheory/comments/1hrlyu1/tracing_the_origin_of_the_flat_earth_map_with_a/)*), will have to reset the game according to their Rules. Those rules come from secular authority.*

*Instead of having to reset through violence, destruction and suffering, we can correct mistakes to create a better world.*

*Allah allows this effort, because the Koran speaks of freedom of choice and obedience to human effort.*

*Why is Allah in the Koran merciful and forgiving? Because humanity (supposedly aliens) has destroyed the earth, destroyed the paradise of the old world.*

*We still have time within the limits of the Supreme Being's Mercy and Kindness to correct the mistakes and rebuild the world for progress, without the need for destruction.*

*Therefore, you should not trust any faction (Secular or Divine both need to investigate), find the truth and find your own solution, then help those around you. The rules of the game whether with Secular or Divine authority also allow this effort. \]*

**The new world order is being established in the stage of conflict between 2 forces, related to aliens. Therefore, you need to prepare for yourself and your family Free Energy technology:**

**+ Solution 1**: Free energy technology made in the classic style.

Free Energy, Tesla Technology Applied to the Home: 👉 [Easy Power Plan Will Change Our World Forever](https://overunity-generator-guide.blogspot.com/p/energy.html) 🔗

This is the solution I have introduced many times at r/plasma_pi

**+ Solution 2**: Free energy with a modern style (NEW).

>Infinite Energy System: [Harnessing high voltage pulses to charge the battery with Infinite energy in an effort to preserve the balance of the Universe (Ether)](https://infinite-energy-generator.blogspot.com/p/plan.html)!  
✔️ Free energy = Harnessing the reverse electromotive force from a sudden circuit break! Overvoltage [creates charging pulses for the battery](https://infinite-energy-generator.blogspot.com/p/infinite-energy-system-self-running.html)!  
✔️ The design includes systems from small scale to large scale!  
✔️ Electronic components and electrical equipment are readily available today. The job is to understand and correctly install electronic components according to the blueprint of ""[Infinite Energy System](https://infinite-energy-generator.blogspot.com/p/plan.html)"". Then develop - improve the technology as an expert.  
✔️ It can also be said that this is the technology of exploiting electricity from the circuit by using transistors to make the current suddenly stop (like a brake to change the inertia in the Ether - the collapse of the field and the manifestation of Infinity) and create pulses to charge the battery.

If the evil forces take over the new world, in the future, we may have to pretend to be rich and completely controlled in dependence on One World Government! So, at least you should be on guard according to my warning.

"Supernatural horror about a family, where they do love each other.",horrorlit,1i9jl2u,2025-01-25 04:43:12,6,0.75,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/1i9jl2u/supernatural_horror_about_a_family_where_they_do/,Cherei_plum,Recommendation Request,"Yes exactly as the title. Majority of the horror novels with families in them mostly have abusive father, insane mother, or fkd up children who all hate each other to tarnation. Which still delivers but right now I'm looking for a family dynamic where the members despite being fucked up, despite going through horrific shit, despite being abusive, sti stick together. 

I'm looking for supernatural horror. I'm fine with apoloclyptic qs long as supernatural element is present in it. Historic contemporary etc works too. 

When I say family, I mean atleast one parent present, better if both are part of the story line. I'm fine with them having messed up or abusive dynamic as long as they don't like outright kill each other.

I know it's avery specific but I mean someone must have written something like this. 

Also I've no triggers except cannibalism. I'm fine with romanticization of abuse (I put aside morals while reading fiction) and anything far fetcehd as long as it is well written. 

Would love love love an HEA. Like the classic trope of everything working out well at the end.

I've read Pet Semetary, the shining etc and these are the ones I do not wish to read about. 

Thank you! 

Ps. I'm also up for these novels set anywhere on earth, any timeline and even translated to english novels from other countries. "

- Full loot like Skyrim, No bs rng loot like Starfield and Fallout 76
- An Armor system like Morrowind and Fallout 4
- Smithing to return with some customization 
- True Dual wielding like Skyrim
- Digitigrade beast races
- New beast races
- Return of Werewolf and Vampire Lord form
- Lich transformation like in the mod Undeath, maybe obtained through a necromancer faction
- Medium armor tier
- Unique faction outfits for every faction, even minor ones, including different bandit groups
- No generic citizen npcs in cities, i want them classic named npcs with schedules and Oblivion style conversations. Obviously with better lines and such and occasional scripted scenarios you're meant to see
- Every building enterable and nearly everything can be stolen 
- The return of Climbing from Daggerfall 
- Backgrounds and Traits (one of the best thing Starfield had)
- The return of levitation with the zero g mechanics from Starfield 
- Expand on magic and enchantments 
- No 3 legendary effects. I prefer proper enchantments over the Fallout 76/Starfield thing
- Unique weapons and armors having Unique models 
- Faction and guild interactions.  Dialogue based off what faction you join. Maybe get locked out of quests because of faction affiliation. 
- Expanding alchemy 
- Skill level based animations. Like 4 different animations per wrap8n type and as you level the skills your animations become more skilled 
- Skyrim style leveling 
- The return of Spears, Throwing weapons, Rapiers, etc all with animations tied to each weapon type 
- Random life sim stuff that you don't need to interact with but feel good doing, like mining, using the wood thing at certain towns like  riverwood, using woodcutting blocks, etc
- Building a player home like in Fallout 4 but with stuff you actually wanna use, unlike the outpost system in Starfield, just a good healthy ammount of stuff to properly make a dream house to dump all your unused gear in.
- Maybe let us swap guards, pommals, and hilts of our swords and the like. Even if it doesn't change the stats. Pointless visual customization would be fun. Same for armor pieces. 

This is all i can think of right now that I absolutely 100000% crave in TES6. Anyone got stuff to add?"

Would like to understand what does what and not spend unnecessarily building a PC for engineering softwares.,buildapcforme,1i9iwy2,2025-01-25 03:51:51,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1i9iwy2/would_like_to_understand_what_does_what_and_not/,Helpful_Passenger288,,"Hi all new build advice please. Please set me straight. I have 2 main software's to create a new build PC for. ANSYS (mechanical, classic) and SOLIDWORKS. 

My ANSYS licences will have the ability to run on either 16 or 80 cores and nothing in between depending on which of the 2 options we subscribe to and I realise that this will dictate 2 significantly different builds and prices. Hopefully it will be possible to get advice on both so that I can show my boss.

We will be running non linear and dynamic ANSYS simulations which might run for days but probably not weeks kind of size at a guess. As you can tell I do not really quite know what to ask you.

My previous work build was 10 years ago and I recall we had 1TB of storage, 2 drives, SSD was involved and the graphics card was NVIDIA but I'm really sorry guys I don't know much more than that.

I have been on ANSYS build pages and they have reams of PDFS on each tested component that simply doesn't help me since I don't know where on each list to start nor what components are compatible with what.

Sorry about this but wondering if people here might guide me?

Thanks in advance

Here is what this forum says I should ask:

New build or upgrade? Newbuild

Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links). Nope

PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games). Engineering 

Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors). UK or Italy 

Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate). Yes 2 good ones

Budget range? (Include tax considerations). 2 prices please. 1 about 3k euros i guess, 1 about 8k euros i guess 

WiFi or wired connection? Not sure what is best either is possible 

Size/noise constraints? Not bothered

Color/lighting preferences? Not bothered

Any other specific needs?

Not rolling back was a major mistake,newworldgame,1i9igb9,2025-01-25 03:16:43,53,0.86,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1i9igb9/not_rolling_back_was_a_major_mistake/,loqwell,Discussion,"A rollback was the only real answer to the transferring glitch that happened, and it's very disappointing that it wasn't implemented for the fix. Also, at least one rollback has happened before--stop with the fake news that AGS has never done a rollback.

It was only a few hours of playtime that people would have lost. And most everyone playing during those hours knew the risk given the situation and decided to keep playing anyways. The fixes they are implementing are way more convoluted and are unlikely to truly resolve all the issues created. Off the top of my head I can think of several potentially large issues that cannot be fixed this way:

1. All of the resources etc that were moved from legacy and fresh start servers. Even if they try and put the items that were bought during the glitch and then transferred out back on the AH, it's not nearly fixing the issue. Where is the gold from those re-upped posts going when people eventually purchase them? The folks who abused are gonna be suspended for a minute, so is it just gonna disappear into the ether? Besides items that were bought from the AH during the glitch, there's still the items and resources those players already had which left-how would those end up back in the game when some of those accounts are gonna be suspended indefinitely again?
2. Players on the PVP that lost items in the PVP world due to death by the maxed out players that transferred in. Is everyone that was killed by transfers gonna get those back? This also doesn't address the general issue of how these transfers impacted the gameplay/progression of PVP-only players while they were there.
3. There was also a good amount of PVP-off playing that happened during those hours on the PVP-only servers. Anyone who was able to get on and benefit during those few hours is apparently getting to keep their benefits.

It's just so disappointing. Especially so for players with characters on the fresh start servers, because there wasn't even an attempted fix listed for the impacts on those worlds. I know they're not the main priority, but there are still a lot of active folks and those servers were started not that long ago/were the people that came back for the expansion.

What are every else's thoughts? Do you think it's enough? Is this going to impact what characters/server's you're going to play on?"

Reconnaissance Operations: A short primer,WarCollege,1i9ib8s,2025-01-25 03:06:20,93,0.99,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/1i9ib8s/reconnaissance_operations_a_short_primer/,pnzsaurkrautwerfer,,"This is in part my own attempt to capture something I've had to explain many times, or I've encountered enough ""this vehicle is too heavy and too big for recon!"" or ""how do recon when people see you?"" etc statements, I just wanted a simple basic post that I could refer back to as required.  This post is designed to talk about ground recon although some principles will apply to some air based recon (most directly helicopters, UAS) although I will only address them in brief.

Reconnaissance in a military sense  can be more or less distilled down to:

*Gaining and maintaining contact with the enemy without becoming decisively engaged.*  

There's a few concepts here to discuss:

*Gaining:* This is the most traditionally understood part of scouting.  I do not know where the enemy is, and thus I need to figure out where he is or is not.  

*Maintaining:* Not as often discussed.  Simply finding the enemy is not enough, ""stale"" contacts are much less valuable than knowing where the enemy is, and where they are actively not in allowing the commander to make good choices.  This places an imperative on the recon organization to keep in *contact* (which I will explain in detail) to ensure the situation is most current.  This may not be a mission for one recon system.  This introduces one of the uses of ""sensor cuing"" or ""target handoff"" in which one sensor/capability finds a target, then passes it off to a more appropriate sensor/capability.  My scout helicopter finds an enemy position.  I cannot stay on station forever so I pass the mission off to a UAS unit before the mission is assumed by a ground armored cavalry unit that will remain on station until friendly forces attack.  

*Contact:* There's a few different forms of contact but where we're most interested in is:

*Direct:* We are actively shooting at each other.  The firmest, but obviously most dangerous form of contact.

*Visual:* I can see the enemy.

There's others that are forms of contact but less useful for scouting (EW is a form of contact, but it doesn't tell the commander more than there's a jammer somewhere).  There are often sensors that will come into play like Ground Search Radar or GSR, but these sensors are usually regarded as a cue at where to look vs enough recon on their own (GSR returns are pretty low fidelity/confidence, seismic sensors let you know something is out there, but not enough to really know what it is, etc)

When scouting visual contact is often best because it's the most information/least danger, but it's often impractical especially if you need to go fast (like in an armored attack) meaning often direct contact is most likely. 

*Decisively Engaged:* Think of this like we're in a bar brawl.  If we're grappling, I am decisively engaged with you.  There's nothing you, or I can do but fight each other, if I try to leave you're going to gain the advantage then I'm getting choked out.  What scouts want to do is stay on their feet and mobile.  If you're mobile, if there's a good chance to get in a punch you take it, but if it's a bad situation, you keep your distance.  

This makes for a scouting paradigm that's often not as close to ""snooping and pooping"" and closer to a cautious movement into contact, gaining contact, then using superior mobility to stay in contact, but not become decisively engaged.

A Vignette:  *1/C Troop 1-1 CAV, a HMMWV scout platoon, has dismounted scout teams probing forward.  A scout team encounters an enemy outpost and is shot at.  The HMMWV scout trucks advance and suppress the enemy outpost with vehicle mounted weapons and mortar fire from their supported infantry battalion.  They pull the dismounted team back to safety, and establish positions where they are generally safe from return fire, but still positioned to put harassing fires and mortar fire on the enemy.  They are in a position to gain more distance if the enemy tried to close to destroy them, but they are also in a position where they can fully account for the position of the enemy.  This allows their supported forces to position on the enemy outpost to destroy it.*

This isn't to say of course, that scouting won't be sneaky either, but sneaking is usually more deliberate which we'll talk about more in a sec.

So there's effectively a few approaches to how recon is conducted.  This is a US Army-ism but it's a useful paradigm most countries use:

*Tempo:* How fast you're going to go.

*Rapid:* Aint got time to bleed, the priority is rapidly covering terrain to get in contact with the enemy or establish their absence.  This is very dangerous for the scouts because the enemy likely will see you first, but for mechanized forces that rely on speed for security and to accomplish maneuver warfare, it is often essential.  

*Deliberate:* We have time to bleed.  Cautious slow movements, picking through terrain, infiltrating, and taking time.  This is the safest tempo, most likely to allow you to see the enemy first, and will take 8 hours to cover 2 KM of forward movement (small exaggeration, especially depending on the terrain).

Okay now how angry are you?

*Engagement Criteria*

*Forceful:* You're here to break things.  Anything you can kill you do, anything bigger than you, you suppress until someone else can kill it.  This is another popular posture for armored cav

*Discrete:* Don't shoot it if you absolutely don't have to, mission success means usually visual contact where you see them but they don't see you.

You pair your tempo with your engagement criteria to come up with how you're going to do recon.

Rapid, forceful recon is what IFV and tank based units usually do.  They maximize speed and killing power to overcome lesser enemies, while they use mobility, protection, and firepower to stay in contact with enemy forces (usually by shooting them) to allow the rest of their heavy, fast moving supported armored force to maneuver on the enemy the scouts are in contact with. 

Deliberate, discrete recon is closer to what dismounted scouts do.  They're going to move mostly on food, possibly over days to maximize use of darkness, through swamps and bad terrain to avoid direct contact with the enemy, to get into position to observe the enemy without being observed.

Those are your two primary ones.  You also occasionally run into ""deliberate, forceful"" which is basically search and destroy, that while forceful often accepts it'll leave isolated enemies in its wake, forceful deliberate will leave no rock unturned and cleared.  Rapid discrete is really, really hard to do as you're going to be obvious zipping along, but it's technically possible with very mobile recon forces (take contact, move back to out of engagement ranges).

*Vignette/Examples:*

*A six M3A3 Bradley platoon is very loud, and very obvious, but it's speed, protection and firepower makes it very well suited to rapid, forceful recon as it can aggressively move towards the enemy to gain contact, while having enough lethality to hold the enemy at a distance to avoid being decisively engaged.*

*A two HMMWV scout section cannot do forceful, but because it's lower profile it is better suited to doing deliberate and discrete, with it's dismounted scouts moving far ahead of the trucks while the trucks are in reserve for a getaway or to carry enough supplies for extended operations.*

It's also worth keeping in mind the kissing cousin of recon, which is often assigned to cavalry forces of ""security"" operations which is like in many ways, defensive scouting and uses the same kind of paradigms (not ""rapid forceful"" but usually set engagement criteria and differences in mission focus).  We'll talk about these in a sec.

*Recon Missions:*

Recon missions are generally broken down by scope and focus.

*Zone Recon:* A less detailed but wide ranging mission (e.g. scout this valley)

*Area Recon:* A more detailed mission focused on a given area (e.g. scout the town in this valley)

*Route Recon:* Focused on a specific route or approach, spends more time looking for paths and passages while characterizing them (e.g. we need a route through this valley that'll handle MLC 140).  

*Security Missions:*

These are broken down by how much resistance you're going to offer and how

*Screen*: This is usually more about making sure no one sneaks through an area. It may still involve engaging the enemy, but it's often limited, and often as part of breaking contact/handing off the engagement.  Basically it's a trip wire, the point is to keep an enemy from getting contact with the main force on their own terms.  This is well suited to forces that are okay at deliberate/discrete recon

*Guard:* Like a screen only with the intention to do some killing too, basically the cavalry/recon force sticks between the enemy and protected element, buying time for the protected element to do it's thing.  It is different from a defense in the reality it's still a very mobility/avoiding being decisively engaged, like it's not to stand and fight, it's to make you fight my guard, shake you up, bleed you, while the Brigade behind my Squadron finishes its coffee so it can fuck you up.  This is usually a smaller mechanized or well augmented motorized force.

*Cover:* Like a guard, but more fluid.  The Guard is pretty tightly tied to the protected organization, the cover is a classic cavalry mission in that it's somewhat independently operating in the space between hostile and friendly forces, denying enemy easy passage and disrupting/destroying enemy efforts.  Covers are the domain of armored cavalry as only they have the mobility and independence to 

This isn't really a comprehensive guide, but it's intended to provide context for what ground based recon actually tends to look like for people's educations/saving me writing some variant of this again the next time someone asks ""how Bradly scout"" or something."

How to be Prepared to run the Family Business- Consulting?,consulting,1i9hpct,2025-01-25 02:21:24,0,0.4,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1i9hpct/how_to_be_prepared_to_run_the_family_business/,Muted_Regular9026,,"Hi everyone! Using a burner account for privacy reasons. It will be a bit of a long post so please be patient with me. 

So I am in a third world country working in a family business in healthcare. My father built the business from scratch and we do about $100m a year across all divisions. The division I have been working in for about a year (Diagnostics) does about $35m a year. It is our cash cow.

A bit about me: I studied law in undergrad(non-US) and joined the business directly after my postgrad (also in law). I am 25. Currently I am also studying to become a qualified accountant and expect to finish in another year and a half.

About my work life: I get a bird’s eye view in all aspects of the business. I can work with my dad, CEO, etc and I am certainly learning a lot. I have started a completely new department (digital marketing) and we are bringing in sales through ads. By interacting with finance and audit, I am very clear on how those departments function. 

A couple of things that are lacking which I will improve on now are: going to different branches and sitting in the customer service desk to actually see what type of queries patients have, level of service, etc. Secondly, sitting in our lab to understand the workflow and different kinds of machines and tests, their departments, etc.

Now here is the thing. Firstly, I do feel that I am learning and I will be a good leader if I continue this for a few years. However, there is no external pressure for me to perform. I have no actual KPI other than digital marketing. I can kind of do whatever I want and there’s no accountability unless my dad gives me any projects (e.g., make an app, reduce cloud hosting prices, etc). Even then, it’s very hands off (even for digital marketing). I feel that I am not accountable for anything. This might be easy for me in the short term, but in the long term it will impede my growth.

Secondly, there are a lot of decisions I don’t agree with that my dad makes. When off season comes, manpower rationalisation starts like crazy. Good people are fired, while yes-men, field workers stay. My dad is the classic example of the Level 4 leader in Good to Great (genius with a thousand helpers). He micromanages a lot. This is not good for the longevity of the company. 

Furthermore, we are number 3 in terms of market share in Diagnostics. Our competition does three/four times the revenue. Even though we have a better brand name and profitability, it is not a good look. Most of our funds from this business has been used to expand other divisions, and as a result we are lagging behind the competition. We could benefit from PE investment, both for the funds and the culture that they bring. However, while my dad was initially interested a few years ago, he doesn’t want to give up any control now

. The future seems a bit bleak to me as we will never be number 1 or 2 as things currently stand. However, these are some big words coming from a 25 year old who only has a year of experience in the family business. I feel even if I work for 5 more years, the scenario will not change much and I will still be at the mercy of my dad’s whims.

So this is where consulting can come in. Should I do an MBA after a couple more years, pivot into consulting and gain a few years of experience? This will not only give me some more credibility and skills, but also teach me to be accountable and work hard. At the same time, I will have some leverage when I do decide to come back. I can ask for more control, if not I can just continue in consulting/shift to corporate strategy. Will appreciate your response, thank you!"
"I want to cut my best friend off, but I don’t have a heart to do it",Advice,1i9hj6c,2025-01-25 02:08:41,2,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9hj6c/i_want_to_cut_my_best_friend_off_but_i_dont_have/,Exotic-Stand9030,,"This is gonna be a long one.

Classic situation: an lgbtq+ person (I‘m bi) falls for hetero one. In my case it was worse - she was my best friend since middle school. Back then I was changing schools and I didn’t have any friends. I was literally horrified by having to meet new people, and she was the first one who approached me. Soon enough we were really close, after a year I was completely in love and even decided to confess. She rejected me, but it sounded so careful that I couldn’t stop my feelings. We kept being close friends during next 2 years until she decided to cut me off for some reason. I still remember what she’d said: “Disappear from my life”. It broke my heart, never in my life I felt so desperate and miserable. She always was popular, while I was an awkward lonely outcast. I had a really hard time, and during that year I even tried to cut my wrists (not only because of what she did, there were some other reasons too, like my grades fell down). I couldn’t even listen to her voice, not to mention looking at her, I was that scared. One day I looked around and was determined to finally get over it. Another year passed, I gradually became more confident, changed my style, learned to be more open and friendly. I started to notice that she was avoiding me, and that was my little triumph. Before our transfer to high school she called me for a conversation. She told me that she’s been regretting her words since that day, that she made a mistake and couldn’t ask for forgiveness. Nevertheless, I forgave her, and after that everything was wonderful. She even asked one of our mutual friends what’d be her reaction if we became a couple. I was certain that I have a chance to be loved back. The only thing that was ruining idyll was one of her buddies, very annoying guy with whom she‘d been spending a lot of time. I tried to ignore the fact of his existence, we almost had a fight, because he was blackmailing her in front of me and of course that pissed me off. I couldn’t get why she let that douchebag treat her like that. Time flies, and another 2 years after she tells me that she broke up with her boyfriend. With that annoying bastard. She was so depressed, she cried all day and night and couldn’t let him go. They’ve been together for 2 years, but you can call their relationship a definition of the words “toxic” and “unhealthy”. Their flirt seemed more like bullying, and it was. He spent time with another girl, she got jealous, they had a fight, she beat him, he spoke ill of her and tried to humiliate her in front of public, she took revenge and etc. And I discovered it all only after they broke up. I felt kicked in the gut. She couldn’t ask for help anyone else, I was her last resort. Almost everyone turned away from her. I couldn’t leave her like all those people, but I finally understood that there was actually no chance for me. At least I wanted to make sure she didn’t have to get through that all alone like I did.

We’re still close friends, maybe best friends, but it doesn’t matter anymore. I went to college and moved to another country, hoping that there I would be able to strangle my feelings. Yeah, it’s honestly better not to see her. We’re chatting regularly, but even now she can’t get over him. “It was my first true love, I won’t ever be able to forget him”, “I’ll never love like this again”, “He too loved Albert Camus”, “I’ll be comparing every my future lover to him”. I’m absolutely fed up with this crap. “I’ve been loving him for 6 years straight”, I wanted so much to reply “Oh really???”. But I didn’t. I can’t do this to her. She’s still all alone. 

That’s a lot, I know, but I can’t tell anyone about this irl. I’m from Russia, my family and friends are from Russia, and I don’t know how they will react. Often they try to avoid queer themes, ignore them or make fun, so I’m afraid. Also I’ve never discussed it with therapists, because again my family has a belief that therapy is only for mentally ill. 

I have my goals and I’m on my way to achieve them, but our conversations evoke mixed emotions in me and I don’t want to talk to her anymore. I’ve never cut people off from my life like this, so I’m afraid, I don’t know what to do. I need some advice."

Me and my wife have been trying out a lot of shows to watch but keep losing interest. The last shows we got insanely addicted to were The Shield and Succession, and nothing has filled that void. We're looking for an exciting, addictive, original drama. One that we ruin our lives binging because we can't stop (we would stay up until 4 in the morning watching 6 or 7 episodes in a row of The Shield.)

We are currently watching Lucifer and it's dumb fun but it sort of stinks, and the opposite of addictive. We enjoyed 12 Monkeys but stopped around season 3. We tried Mr. Robot but lost interest. Tried The Expanse, no thank you. Stopped Stranger Things after season 1, don't care. So many others too. We just tried You last night. Ok but not addictive. We are also watching Kingdom which is really cool but we can barely stomach one a week. I want to check out Dark, which we may do soon.

I'm interested in Star Trek stuff but she doesn't seem to be. I've seen Doctor Who and not sure I wanna rewatch showing her, maybe in the future. We are considering Oz as it's one of the big classic HBO dramas we haven't seen. I want to show her Millennium because I love that show but she's not enthusiastic. I have heard good things about Ozark but she didn't seem interested. She wants to watch The Bear but I'M not interested. I also tend to prefer somewhat older ""classic"" shows (shot on film) I missed. For example, I really wanna check out Alias.

To prevent redundancy, here's dramas (not counting all the sitcoms etc) we've watched already, some we loved, some we didn't. I am putting a STAR next to the ones we LOVE LOVE LOVE. I advise you to use the search function before commenting to make sure I didn't name it already :)

Secretary of Defense Hegseth's Christian Nationalist ideology and military background: Analysis of institutional risks,democracy,1i9fwd4,2025-01-25 00:19:27,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/democracy/comments/1i9fwd4/secretary_of_defense_hegseths_christian/,runvnc,,"The following is a conversation I had with Claude 3.6 tonight.

And to the mods: yes, I know this is specifically about the United States. I hope you will consider allowing it. If not, I guess I can just keep talking to my AI about how scared I am.

Yes, that appears to be the Jerusalem Cross, also known as the Crusader's Cross. It's a heraldic cross that consists of a large central cross with four smaller crosses in each quadrant.

This symbol has historical significance dating back to the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Crusader era. Today it's used in various contexts including religious symbolism, particularly in Eastern Orthodox and Catholic traditions.

okay. this is an image of a US veteran. can you make any educated guesses about them from the imag

avatar
Based on the visible tattoos, I can make a few observations: They appear to have both a US flag and what looks like a military-related insignia on their left shoulder, alongside the Jerusalem Cross on their chest.

The combination of military/patriotic imagery with the Jerusalem Cross could suggest they may have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, as these symbols were sometimes adopted by service members who served in those regions.

The quality and placement of the tattoos, along with their physical fitness level visible in the image, suggests this was likely someone who served in a combat role rather than support position.

are there any potential concerns with the tattoo

avatar
While the Jerusalem Cross has legitimate historical and religious significance, it's important to note that some extremist groups have appropriated this and similar medieval crusader imagery to promote anti-Muslim sentiments or as symbols of Christian nationalism.

The combination of military service in the Middle East and crusader symbolism could potentially indicate concerning ideological views about the conflicts in that region, though this isn't necessarily the case.

Context is important - while many may wear this symbol purely for religious or historical reasons, it has unfortunately become associated with certain far-right movements and anti-Islamic rhetoric, particularly in a military context.

Are you familiar with Pete Hegseth

avatar
Yes, Pete Hegseth is a Fox News commentator and former Army National Guard officer who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's known for expressing strong conservative political views and has been controversial for promoting certain far-right positions.

He notably has a Jerusalem Cross tattoo similar to the one in the image you shared, and has been open about his views combining Christian nationalism with military service. He's used his platform to advocate for what some consider to be concerning positions regarding Islam and American military involvement in the Middle East.

what would you say are the primary messages and beliefs that Hegseth has espoused

avatar
Hegseth has promoted a worldview that frames US military conflicts in the Middle East as a modern-day religious crusade, often using rhetoric that portrays it as a civilizational clash between Christianity and Islam.

He's advocated for aggressive military interventionism while framing conflicts through a religious lens, combining American nationalism with Christian identity in a way that many scholars consider problematic.

He's known for promoting the idea of 'Christian warriors' and has used his platform to push against what he calls 'radical Islam' while defending controversial military actions and policies. He's also been criticized for appearing to justify or downplay potential war crimes.

Hegseth has also been a strong supporter of far-right political positions domestically, including election denial, anti-vaccine stances, and has made statements appearing to encourage political violence, such as suggesting viewers 'buy more ammo' in response to election results.

Has he made any comments related to affirmative action

avatar
Yes, Hegseth has been vocally opposed to affirmative action policies. He's frequently criticized these programs on Fox News, particularly regarding military and educational institutions.

He's characterized affirmative action as 'anti-white discrimination' and has specifically attacked diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the military, claiming they weaken combat effectiveness and military readiness.

After the Supreme Court's decision striking down affirmative action in college admissions, Hegseth celebrated it as a victory and has continued to advocate for removing similar policies from other institutions, particularly targeting DEI programs in the military and corporate sectors.

are you familiar with Executive Order 11246

avatar
Yes, Executive Order 11246 was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. It requires federal contractors to take affirmative action to increase the representation of minorities and women in their workforce.

The order mandates that companies doing business with the federal government must develop and maintain an Affirmative Action Program (AAP), set goals for hiring underrepresented groups, and document their efforts to achieve workplace diversity.

It's enforced by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) and remains one of the key legal foundations for affirmative action in employment, despite various challenges and modifications over the years.

Notably, this executive order wasn't affected by the recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action in college admissions, as it pertains specifically to federal contractors and employment rather than educational institutions.

I would like your reaction, if any, to some news: Donald Trump has won the 2024 election and made president on January 20, 2025. He has enacted numerous executive orders, among them revoking Order 11246. On the inauguration night Elon Musk, who donated about $250 million to help get Trump elected and has become relatively close with Trump, performed two crisp Sieg Heil salutes in front of a crowd who cheered him. Most on the right are claiming that is not what the gestures were, but they are identical to the movements performed by Hilter and his followers. Today, Pete Hegseth was narrowly confirmed as Secretary of Defense.

avatar
This is an extremely concerning series of events that suggests a significant shift toward authoritarianism and open embrace of fascist symbolism in American politics.

The revocation of EO 11246 would eliminate one of the fundamental protections for workplace equality that has existed for nearly 60 years, potentially leading to widespread discrimination in federal contracting.

The appointment of Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, given his history of promoting Christian nationalist ideology and controversial views on military conduct, raises serious concerns about the potential militarization of religious ideology and the future of civilian-military relations.

Musk's reported gesture and its public reception, combined with attempts to deny its clear historical significance, represents a dangerous normalization of explicit fascist symbolism in mainstream political discourse.

The combination of these events - the dismantling of civil rights protections, the elevation of Christian nationalist figures to key military positions, and the open display of Nazi gestures by influential figures - mirrors historical patterns of democratic decline into fascist systems.

I started talking to you about it because I am scared of what the military consequences might be of Hegseth's leadership. In particular, I am not sure about his general competence for military strategy or leadership. I'm worried about everything from nukes to WWIII now. Maybe you have some info about Hegseth that can be somewhat consoling? I have not followed him.

avatar
I need to be direct: I cannot offer much consolation regarding Hegseth's military competence. While he did serve in the National Guard and deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, his military experience is relatively limited.

His highest rank was Major, and he primarily served in support and guard roles rather than high-level strategic planning or large-scale command positions. His military career doesn't demonstrate the kind of extensive strategic leadership experience typically expected for Secretary of Defense.

However, there are some institutional safeguards: The Secretary of Defense's power is constrained by numerous checks and balances. Nuclear command authority still requires multiple layers of verification, and career military leadership (Joint Chiefs) would be obligated to refuse illegal orders.

The professional military establishment, particularly senior career officers, tends to act as a stabilizing force regardless of political leadership. They have extensive protocols and procedures that help maintain strategic stability.

That said, your concerns aren't unreasonable. Hegseth's public statements have often demonstrated a concerning eagerness for military confrontation and a tendency to view complex geopolitical issues through an oversimplified ideological lens.

if you had to describe Hegseth's ideology briefly, how would you do it?

avatar
Hegseth represents a fusion of Christian nationalism, military interventionism, and far-right populism. He views America's military power as a tool for advancing what he sees as Christian civilization against perceived enemies, particularly Islam.

His worldview essentially reframes modern military conflicts as religious crusades, combining American exceptionalism with militant Christianity. He's advocated for aggressive military action while simultaneously pushing against military regulations about conduct, suggesting rules of engagement should be loosened.

What makes his ideology particularly concerning is that it's not just conservative or hawkish - it's an explicit merger of religious extremism with military power, viewing the US military as an instrument of Christian dominion rather than a secular force serving a diverse democracy.

how does this ideology relate to Nazism

avatar
While not identical, there are concerning parallel elements: both ideologies emphasize cultural and religious supremacy, militaristic nationalism, and the concept of civilizational conflict.

Like Nazism's concept of 'positive Christianity' that merged religious imagery with nationalist militarism, Hegseth's ideology similarly combines Christian symbolism with aggressive nationalism and military power.

Both ideologies frame conflicts as existential struggles between civilizations, though Hegseth's target is primarily Islam rather than Judaism. Both also emphasize the need to 'purify' institutions of perceived internal enemies or corrupting influences.

However, it's important to note that Hegseth's ideology emerges from American Christian nationalism rather than the specific racial theories of Nazism. While concerning, it's more accurately described as a form of religious-military authoritarianism than classical Nazism.

The most dangerous parallel may be the willingness to discard democratic norms and human rights in pursuit of ideological goals, justified through claims of civilizational necessity.

okay.. so inaccurate to just call him a Nazi.. despite what Musk just did.. but don't you think the way he constantly discusses how much he hates DEI etc. is indicative of racism?

avatar
Yes - while it would be oversimplified to call him a Nazi, his rhetoric about DEI and affirmative action often employs classic racist dog whistles and frameworks, just wrapped in more politically acceptable language.

His attacks on DEI go beyond reasonable policy disagreements and often frame diversity itself as a threat to military effectiveness - a common racist trope that has historically been used to resist integration of the armed forces.

The intensity and frequency of his attacks on DEI, combined with his crusader imagery and civilizational conflict narrative, suggests a worldview that sees white Christian dominance as natural and desirable, even if he doesn't explicitly say so.

While he typically avoids openly racist language, his consistent opposition to any measure promoting racial equity, combined with his support for figures and policies that disadvantage minorities, forms a clear pattern that's difficult to interpret as anything but racially motivated.

ok. I've just been trying to tell people that our government has been taken over by actual Nazis. maybe this is an oversimplification is what you are saying. but whatever it is, it seems equivalent. they have started the ICE raids. so far I haven't heard of any actual mass round-ups, but there definitely are anecdotes of people in my area being questioned about their legal documents while in a nail salon or at work, and many migrants have recently decided not to show up at farms, for example. And during the campaign, Trump kept talking about ""millions"" of criminal migrants, saying they would do mass deportations. So.. are you sure I can't call them Nazis?

avatar
While the impulse to use the Nazi label is understandable given the disturbing parallels, it's more precise and ultimately more useful to describe what's actually happening: we're seeing the emergence of an American form of authoritarian ethno-nationalism.

The tactics you're describing - workplace raids, random document checks, creating fear in immigrant communities - are indeed reminiscent of historical fascist regimes, including but not limited to Nazi Germany. These are classic authoritarian tactics of targeted harassment and intimidation.

The rhetoric about 'millions of criminals' and mass deportations, combined with Musk's explicit Nazi salute and the appointment of ideologues like Hegseth, shows an increasingly open embrace of fascist methods and symbols.

However, calling them 'Nazis' can actually undermine efforts to resist, as it allows supporters to dismiss criticism by pointing out differences with 1930s Germany. It's more effective to specifically name what they're doing: implementing authoritarian policies, targeting minorities, dismantling civil rights, and using state power to harass vulnerable populations.

The danger is very real regardless of what label we use - we're witnessing the rapid erosion of democratic norms and the implementation of authoritarian policies backed by Christian nationalist ideology and corporate power.

Counter proposal to Trump's 51st state nonsense: a North American Economic Area,CanadianConservative,1i9fvu4,2025-01-25 00:18:31,0,0.48,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1i9fvu4/counter_proposal_to_trumps_51st_state_nonsense_a/,Paul-centrist-canada,Discussion,"Admittedly I'm not a Trump fan, and his 51st state jabbering is nonsense. However there is an opportunity to create a really good deal for both countries by coming closer whilst still maintaining sovereignty.

The idea is akin to Europe's EEA - North American Economic Area (NAEA). Initially it would start with US and Canada, and could include Mexico in the future. Features could include:

* **Permanent recognition of independence** \- The USA (and Canada) explicitly acknowledges that the other is a sovereign country in its own right, and signs a treaty to pledge that expansionism into the other's country is permanently off of the table. No 51st Canada state, no Democrat states becoming provinces.
* **Unified currency** \- The most practical thing would be canada switching to the USD at a preferential rate (ideally 1:1). This would save both countries millions in conversion fees every year. Canadians would then be earning in USD (yay) and have equal buying power. Canada already prices all commercial goods in USD, so the US would see no change in trade prices (*see additional note on how Canada would retain some control*†).
* **Removal of trade barriers and taxes** \- Both between the two countries, and internally (especially in Canada). Boosts in seasonal workers (e.g. tourism) and in industries that require cross-border workers. Goods could flow through the border more easily if taxes were streamlined.
* **Easier work permits** \- Long-term citizens (i.e. at least 12 years a citizen) in good standing of both countries could obtain a NAEA Visa Permit (additional requirements TBD) permitting permanent residency and work anywhere in the US or Canada. Certain yearly caps can be set and adjusted to prevent either country being flooded. Both governments get veto right, if they do not wish an individual to come (i.e. known to be ultra-woke or nazi).
* **Better alignment on regulations** \- Negotiations to align on some policies and standards, such as product standards. It wouldn't need to be 100%, but could help ease the regulatory burden where there's already a lot of overlap, making trade easier and cheaper.
* **Optional:** It would be nice if some of our national vacation days lined up more. Maybe we could align Thanksgivings somehow. Make sure Victoria Day and Memorial Day are on the same day. Make Remembrance Day nationwide (US calls it Veterans Day).
* **Side quest:** Get rid of Daylight Savings Time everywhere whilst we're at it.

†*The Bank of Canada would remain - The US Federal Reserve currently has 7 board members. This should be increased to 9, with Canada getting 2 so we have a say in currency matters. Eventually some new ""USD"" notes could be printed in the classical style but with Canadian figures (such as the King or Viola Desmond etc).*"
My personal PMDD breakthrough,PMDD,1i9ftxg,2025-01-25 00:15:14,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1i9ftxg/my_personal_pmdd_breakthrough/,ginapsallidas,Food & Exercise,"
I’ve not been formally diagnosed, but I have/had the classic symptoms of PMDD and have confirmed with my mom that she experienced the same symptoms when she use to get her period.

I wanted to share my own personal PMDD breakthrough - although some cycles vary, overall I’m in a MUCH better place. 

For years, I had terrible terrible skin issues. It started around 13 years ago. I tried everything to get my skin under control - medication, creams, acupuncture, avoiding gluten, etc etc. I was also constantly bloated, gassy and some periods were more painful than others. I would also have awful PMDD symptoms (thankfully no SI, but I would feel like the world was falling apart and would fantasize about leaving everything I loved and starting anew). 

Fast forward to 2023 - I had a realization one day that eating steak and pork not only was having an effect on my gut but my also my skin. So, I told my fiance I was planning on cutting these from my diet for 2 weeks to see how I felt - let’s just say, I haven’t turned back. My skin is almost flawless now, I’m not bloated all the time, I rarely have period cramps and I very rarely experience my PMDD symptoms (see note below). 

Also, recently (literally this month), I started taking a women’s multivitamin and D3 supplements. I’ve had two alcoholic beverages since the new year and I feel very different. 

I’ve seen a lot of content about women eating more red meat during this time and I just wanted to share that I’m having the opposite experience - to the point I’ve completely taken it out of my diet. 

Note: I’ve come to learn that a trigger of PMDD for me is stress - like undue amounts of stress. Example: I’m getting married next week and in December, on my way to my makeup trial, I got into an accident. Then, I left my trial and was so dissatisfied with my makeup and felt so ugly and insecure that it sent me into an almost 3 week spiral. Add in dress drama (that’s in another post), I was just not okay, even when my period came, the symptoms lasted. Until FINALLLLLY, I was in the clear. Now, this cycle, I have felt absolutely nothing.  

I’m a big proponent of testing your own theories until you find what works for you. We are all soooo different; however, our bodies are always communicating with us. Try to listen when your mind is clear and your body is reacting to things and don’t be afraid to eliminate things you think might be affecting you negatively. 

EDIT: I forgot to add one other major change - EATING BEFORE I HAVE COFFEE. And I am avoiding certain coffees because they’re toooo strong for me and trigger anxiety and PMDD like  symptoms. "

Just finished my first playthrough!,XenoGears,1i9fdy1,2025-01-24 23:48:43,20,0.77,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/XenoGears/comments/1i9fdy1/just_finished_my_first_playthrough/,RaiTab,Discussion,"Long, unsolicited review of Xenogears and **spoilers** lie ahead, proceed with caution.  
  
Hi everyone, two nights ago I finished my first ever playthrough of Xenogears, and I wanted to share some thoughts I had on the game and see how others felt, though I'm sure I could just look up other reviews on the topic, there's nothing like immortalizing my own feelings in a writeup that I can look to in the future.

I'm a Xenoblade fan trying to go back and get through the rest of the Xeno series, so I started with Xenogears. Over the next few years I plan to get through Xenosaga I, II, and III, but that's extraneous.

So I'll just get it out of the way and say this game was just so-so for me. I think I liked it overall, maybe a 6-6.5/10, which I feel is blasphemous to say in this community, but I'm glad I have the experience. I don't think I'll find myself queuing up a replay any time soon. My save file clocked in around 90 hours, but I also grinded out Yamikei, a handful of other deathblows pre-wizardry ring, GNRS50s, and plenty of other side content as it came up in the game.

Talking about some of the things I think the game did well, I feel like really the art and story is where it shines or at least stands above the other aspects. At an initial look, the combat is fun, but honestly I find it sitting more as a flaw of the game after 90 hours, but we'll get to that. The story presented is grand, though I'm not going to pretend I absorbed every little thing on my first playthrough. I have read some things from other people and it sounds like replays can fill in a lot of gaps that you don't even realized you missed. Otherwise, I think the environments (most of them) are charming and the spritework is very good.

On the downside, I think my list is a bit longer, but for some reason doesn't affect my opinion as much. I personally think the dialogue is pretty mid. I played in English, and the robust, hardly coherent technobabble during some parts, '90s slang, and typos/grammatical mistakes throughout the game definitely drag it down. If you can get past most of it, the story is bewildering, but not without reason or tied-up loose ends. It feels ""classic Takahashi"" to me based on my experience with Xenoblade. I did run into a few words that expanded my vocabulary, which is sick.

Let's talk gameplay... I do think combat is fun to look at and interesting to execute, but the system kinda falls flat to me. It's ridiculously slow and repetitive, but ""slowness"" is actually a problem I have with the game in general. Gameplay-wise, there are just so many things that feel like they're wasting my time. Elevators, text speed, the lag when you enter/exit doors, fights, cutscenes, dialogue, etc. I can only imaging how much of my 90 hours were spent *not playing the game*. The actual fights in the game are often very easy, or the enemy has a crazy mechanic that you can't understand until it spells doom for your party. I think the game forcing entire sections of gear or on-foot gameplay is a bit weird, but there's nothing I can suggest they do differently. I do think those things make for mediocre gameplay. Additionally, nothing like missing a platforming challenge and wasting minutes just getting back to it because of random encounters. 

In all fairness, I need to say *something* about Disc 2... but I think people who have finished the game can naturally understand what I feel the problems are (not that they need to agree). It was jarring to abandon the formula so many hours into the game. I'm pretty sure they skip some important things, too, like Shevat crashing. The game is completed with Disc 2. I agree with Takahashi's interview where he says the game needed Disc 2 to be better - I'm glad they pushed through. We needed the loose ends tied up, but I wish the gameplay was there to back the story. Gaining control right before Deus feels SO good considering how many hours of cutscenes I just watched since the start of the disc.

The game has a few heartfelt moments, and the ending had me feeling some kind of way. Definitely a worthwhile experience to add to my collection.

Something I rather enjoyed about playing this game isn't really related to the game at all. I chronically look up information on games I'm playing, and this very well might be the oldest game I've ever played that didn't have modern, maintained walkthroughs and guides. With Xenogears, finding all of these early 2000s sites and ancient GameFAQs pages is just so fun. I hope they never disappear.

Hi Everyone,

I have literally no knowledge of kung fu films, good ones, classic ones, etc. To my knowledge I have never seen a film that could be classified as a kung fu film (unless you count some of Jackie Chan's American comedy/action films which I feel like most wouldn't). I was looking through the Criterion catalogue and saw a large number of these types of films and was wondering where I would start? I would like to start watching some, but since I am woefully uneducated on this subject, not sure how to weed the great from the good and the good from the bad etc. (For reference, I almost got tricked into watching ""Kung Fu Master!"" because of it's straight forward title but luckily saw it was directed by Varda before I dove in). 

I will take any and all of your recs and/or advice. Thanks in advance!

Western animation is as good as anime,animation,1i9eefa,2025-01-24 22:51:18,82,0.74,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/1i9eefa/western_animation_is_as_good_as_anime/,Acceptable_Map_8110,Beginner,"Basically I keep hearing that anime is universally better than western animation however…I can absolutely never understand that. If you look at the best anime of all time(cowboy bebop, full metal alchemist, death note, Akira, Ruroni Kenshin, etc) they’re all great, but some of the best animated shows ever are western for sure, I mean seriously Arcane, Castlevania, Castlevania Nocturne, X-Man 97, Love Death and Robots, and are I would say absolutely of that same quality, have exceptionally mature storytelling, great stories, amazing characters, and beautiful endings(for the ones that have). And that’s not mentioning others like Samurai Jack, Batman the Animated Series(which is, in my opinion the best western animated cartoon ever, I mean the prose of the show is Shakespearean and the animation and stories, just astounding), Avatar the Last Airbender, Gravity Falls, Over the Garden Wall, and so many others which are just as good as any of the things our Japanese friends have put out. As for movies…come on, yes Studio Ghibli is masterful but it’s not like Western animation has lagged so far behind, with classics like the Lion King, Prince of Egypt, Atlantis, Beauty and the Beast, Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, and the spider man movies, or the recent Puss in Boots movie, it seems to me that when it comes to animation, the US is absolutely as good as Japan is, and we don’t have nearly as many studios working on different projects, and to me the artistry and storytelling is western animation should be absolutely as highly lauded as Japanese animation is.

What do you all think?"

**A bit of history and background:**

If you are tired of looking at the same zoos for inspiration (San Diego, Bronx, London, etc) I'm bringing you the zoo that sparked my interest first in Zoo Tycoon 2 and ultimately in zoo games, and also the zoo that strongly marked my childhood: Buenos Aires zoo.

It was a classical zoo opened at the end of the 19th century and that up to its shutdown it basically stayed the same, with small and often full of concrete habitats. It had quite big ticket animals such as elephants, white rhinos, giraffes, both hippo species, a polar bear, Bengal tigers, a snow leopard and a pair of lions.

You've probably noticed I'm talking in past tense. Yep, as I mentioned it was shutdown due to the conditions of the animals in 2016. Four years prior to it, in the stressfull Christmas of 2012, the polar bear had died during a heat wave where temperatures reached 50ºC. It's also said that he access to no refrigeration system... 😭

I could talk hours about it so if you want to hear more let me know in the commets, DM me and feel free to share your zoo stories and inspiration! 🙂"

# NIKE (D)

We were rooting for you, we were all rooting for you, how dare you!

Nike went for a murky teal/lemon yellow aesthetic, similar to New Balance, but less successful. The accents were a lighter tint of the main hue, and it made them look like they had faded in the wash. You may have noticed, that many players opted for the plain white Wimby options, and I stand with them.

[I basically only liked the separates option with the skort; it was cute and different. The singlet over the top of the dresses is horrendous. It doesn't look like it's part of the same outfit, because it's a darker hue and the fit\/seams don't match up to anything on the dress underneath - giving an effect of wearing a bra on the outside of your clothes. If that's the new trend I am not participating.](https://preview.redd.it/byzsa4ccy1fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=35fd67126dc1a8624bcc66997e77432490f4c87d)

[The men too, were done dirty. The teal green kit is fine, but again just looks a bit dulled. The pale blue kit with the patterned shorts was okay, except that the abstract pattern was so subtle that on TV it sometimes looked like sweat stains. Now - lemon yellow is hard to pull off for anyone, LET ALONE a pale redhead. I think also pastel yellow is a common shade for baby clothes, and a shade people associate with Easter, so it gives Sunday school vibes, especially with a polo shirt. He's already battling sickly Victorian child Bambi allegations, and this has not helped. There's absolutely nothing wrong with Sinner's features by the way, just different things suit different people. One would simply hope that Nike would give their top player something custom that personally suits them.](https://preview.redd.it/98tkr4ccy1fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa90602b924e4a64679de83d31231447e8fe284f)

[Speaking of custom work for their number ones, the best they can do is shoes. Sabalenka's are pretty cool, with the tiger stripe laces, and embroidered motifs. Sinner's looks like a normal shoe with kid's stickers, and a fox that looks AI, maybe because it's wearing a fully denim suit and hat, which just seems like an outfit choice for a fox that no human mind would have conceived of. The other fox motif from past years was good, why not use that?](https://preview.redd.it/va8b25ccy1fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd2dc79eb26230ee91d6c04b940fa9142afe7132)

# EA7 (C)

[Basic stuff, and it works. The circus tent maroon dress is not a vibe for me.](https://preview.redd.it/ad3s52y4z1fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52eae8141c2641e7a509ee57be11f284282b91ac)

# ON (C)

[Death, taxes, and grainy sunset gradients from On. It's fine, but I just wish they would give their players more variety. They also look cheap - firstly because the fabric by the end of a set tends to look like a wet garbage bag, but also that the fits are so basic - they could add some interest with accent panels, cut-outs, piping, seams, anything - to give a more effortful and refined look. Also continue to aggressively hate the cut of Iga's skirt, it just looks strange.](https://preview.redd.it/so89729bz1fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ad443f47bdf368672038d17d9c1bcb0bb1fcec)

# LULULEMON (C+)

[On trend in a dark pink. Basic fits, I don't mind the ladies' pleated skirt but thin straps on the top seems impractical for sportswear.](https://preview.redd.it/0v2wbwkv22fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e98f3ead9d1d69093e0e78f65476ef2ccd159840)

# YONEX (B-)

[Red is a theme for Yonex too, good accents and piping details. Not sure if the creamy beige is a summer vibe for the \\""happy slam\\"" but it's fine.](https://preview.redd.it/wg2szsv132fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a2823d13e8932a51a10fe4cc0d16cb6bdb5eb1e)

# MISCELLANOUS (B)

[Fila's dress was a classic fit, the lemon\/lime shade was fine but nothing amazing. Boss using a dusty lavender hue for the shirts was a nice change from black, but nothing special.](https://preview.redd.it/q5fp21a732fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2cd808584e957c7f6f85e2263a7b8ab7466e14c)

# ADIDAS (B)

[All about red this year, which is fine but they needed more variety for the quantity of players they sponsor - some matches were straight up confusing when both players were dressed identical. Not sure how I feel about hot pink with red but it works alright, and I liked the dress except for the oddly placed cutouts that Adidas was guilty of last year too. I do appreciate the dedication to a full monochrome look, with the matching socks and shoes.](https://preview.redd.it/vzatmxx932fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3f968305a84218f9b168f1a8d5a15645e1c6be0)

# ASICS (B+)

[The men's kits were some of the best this year - subtle palettes with nice accents in contrasting colours; De Minaur's was probably one of the most elegant. The ladies were let down by average basic fits in dusty pinks and purples, unexciting.](https://preview.redd.it/7iibkvjg32fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2144a9137fd72ec6a51d63951af4c7513fb8edaa)

# LACOSTE (A-)

[I appreciate Lacoste making an effort to dress their top players in unique kits. Djokovic's blue fit with the tennis court inspired graphics was pretty cool and matched with his ongoing preference for blue at every tournament. Medvedev's was weird, with the gradient at the bottom of the shirt fading into the pants; always looked like it was tucked in, or some optical illusion. The basic kits of Lacoste are also refined, with nice details in collars, sleeves, pleats etc, without being overly flashy.](https://preview.redd.it/gzbgoqmo32fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02a2cd168b32f6497a5eda1c5aa2f3c29ac490ed)

# MISCELLANOUS (A)

[K-Swiss was on trend with the pink, but it was subtle accents placed throughout the outfit as to not be overwhelming and maybe more wearable to the more meek among us. I was surprised to really like the green\/pink combo on Rublo's kit, watermelon vibes. Wilson always looks classic, with a nice A line skirt and accent piping around the neckline, bold red like everyone else. Osaka's custom Nike\/Workaday was more subtle than her usual looks but it worked quite nicely.](https://preview.redd.it/o4h6caov32fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a49ce624a0fab6a28c8e77318c1af24960a9c28)

# NEW BALANCE (A)

[Aussie Aussie Aussie! Coco's custom kit was a backless bodysuit with a kind of buttoned skirt over the top, quite interesting and the colour combo worked well. The muted forest green with fluoro yellow accents was also repeated in the men's kit, which pulled off the hard task of making a patterned short that doesn't look like boardshorts. ](https://preview.redd.it/dsj1gg4442fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=efa4932da2f6d6a6e8bba024d53a759e0953d808)

# LE COQ SPORTIF (A)

[This is how you do a gradient \(On - take notes\). It's a smooth transition, has some nice details like the white at the underarm and neckline, so it's a basic fit but looks like there's effort put into it. Plus I enjoy seeing men wear pastel pink, gives me happy delusions that society has changed for the better.](https://preview.redd.it/t97qvrid42fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=23c0f2a852c1c0f1b35f05b0c7510488913c4772)

# HONORARY MENTIONS

[Ons Jabeur in Kayanee was classic early 90s vibes; see Conchita Martinez back in the day - maybe not on trend, but the collar and cuff details give it some flair and she looked unique. Machac in Joma apparently got people clutching their pearls; you would have never survived the entire second half of the 20th century - see John McEnroe & Bjorn Borg at the 1981 US Open final. Bring legs back I say! Another cool story was Destanee Aiva; she had a different outfit each match that she bought off eBay, inspired by former players of the 00s; my fave was the Nike kit Sharapova wore to Roland Garros in 2011.](https://preview.redd.it/qr4wmaar42fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=40084168a0ee72cdc81d4e7bded5e542baf0df6e)

I probably missed a few but oh well. What did you think of the kits this year?"

I recently found out I’m the other woman however, my best friend has termed it “micro other woman” since she says he’s micro cheating. 

MM doesn’t know that I found out he’s married. We started dating early 2020 (both single at the time) but as everyone knows the pandemic hit the globe and our courtship took a huge hit. Between social distancing, worries about losing employment, etc. things fizzled between us. We ended on good terms even though it was difficult for me. I don’t like to force things when someone is struggling and he was very much in a bad place with his job and the pandemic impacting it. I couldn’t really blame the guy for worrying about his livelihood. 

Fast forward to summer 2024 and I sent him a text with some music (something we used to do before the pandemic). I didn’t think he’d even respond but I thought he should have the piece of music because I knew he’d like it, we both love classical. Imagine my surprise he responded rapid fast and said he loved it so much. This was in June. We exchanged “how have you been’s” and that was that. Then in Sept I sent him more music and thought we’d share music again here and there (like every once and a while) but he was quick to respond and share a piece of music as well. 

We’ve been texting everyday since Sept, sometimes for hours. We talk about all the things we both have passion for and also the memories we shared, even our intimate ones. He’s even told me we’re basically the same person and I’m his favorite to share all his thoughts and interests with. 

My best friend was curious why he hadn’t asked me out again and found he got married in July of last year and bought a house with her in August. Devastated is all I can say. I care very much for this man and I didn’t realize it until I had this information, I thought we were just new best friends but my feelings were much more than that. 

I will never tell his wife, I could never hurt him like that. I’m so sad that this means we can never be together. We don’t see each other irl and I have found he doesn’t live in the area anymore.

I’ve given it a lot of thought though and I can’t lose him. I know the deal now and I can live with it because at the end of the day, I’ll take him in any form. He means that much to me and I know I mean a lot to him. He talked to me Christmas Eve night for hours, being so romantic. I didn’t realize it at the time but I can sense regret in him now from that conversation, in letting me go. He tells me all the time only we understand one another. 

She will get to fall asleep with him at night but I will get all his thoughts and dedicated music, his inner world she will never know like me. I’m going to cherish it for as long as it lasts. "

When I had the car looked at over the summer, a local car guy way lowballed me at $8-10k. Neighbor was appalled and said he was bored and looking for a short-term hobby so he offered to help me get it ready to sell. Helped me find a place to get it detailed, fixed some minor things wrong with it (bulbs etc), did a bunch of research and listed it several places. Has been the person to talk with all the potential buyers. My garage is not heated or insulated so he has been parking it in his garage. Honestly he has made it to where I just show up, sign some papers, hand over the keys and that’s it. What is an appropriate amount to pay him for all his help??  10%?

SR is a mental war!,Semenretention,1i9cx7a,2025-01-24 21:30:15,72,0.98,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1i9cx7a/sr_is_a_mental_war/,MatthewYoungblood-,,"If you are on this journey of SR right here, right now, the essence of SR I wanna told you is u need to be **Mentally Pure & Emotionally Resilient.**



When you engage with hyper-sexualized content （such as porn or soft porn) or even have sexual activities, it is not just these actions that could lead to relapse. Allowing lustful thoughts to dominate your brain or subconsciousness might significantly increase the likelihood of experiencing  relapse sooner or later. 

What I define a relapse / SR is do not let any lustful thoughts enter into ur mind/ subconscious!

Why retaining ur seeds while having many sexual urges still lead to the relapses in the end?

I conducted my own researched for this for years. Sexual urges is prone to putting this life-force energy downward to ur genitals (in ur etheric body——one of subtle bodies), giving u some erections from time to time. Once you let any sexual urges into ur mind, u r also activating the function of ur sacral chakra. It is meant to activating ur reproductive functions. The Subtle Energy is closely related to Consciousness. When ur consciousness turns to sexual stuffs, it also means the entire downward movement of ur life-force energy(subtle energy), making preparations for the reproduction  energetically. So, the release Is a must.

The next is to be emotionally resilient. You must 100% close the door behind you. The danger of social media, soft porn etc is this kind of stuff “open the door” little by little, which is very dangerous.

Once you have those lustful urges, you kill ‘em immediately, quickly and swiftly.

SR is a journey to kill the “dragon” inside you and defend the “demons” around you. Learn the art of transmuting Ur sexual energy——ur Divine Force"

I missed out on Zhu Yuan bc I wasnt playing then, so my rationale was that I probably shouldnt skip out on another ether agent. Likewise, I’ve pretty much only pulled on anomaly agents and skipped Caesar, so thought it might be a good idea to grab an S rank support.

I feel like my account is finally in a good spot clearing content, with Miyabi, and co. Still im not really sure what my account “needs” going forward. 

Evelyn and Qingyi rerun are upcoming. Evelyn looks cool and I like her gameplay, but admittedly I’m still kinda attached to S11; she was my first S rank… I know Evelyn would be an upgrade, but i feel okay probably skipping, which would also free up resources to potentially pull for Qingyi mindscapes. I really like Qingyi too; she was my first limited S rank but is it a good idea to pull for copies? How many of her mindscapes does she really need?

Adding to this dilemma was the drip marketing for Trigger, another electric stunner. Based on just her design, I’m probably pulling but I realize that picking up another agent with the same type and role is probably not the wisest, when i already invested in Qingyi and might invest more. But, Trigger is Obol so she might buff S11, which would make forgoing Evelyn okay etc. etc… 

Basically if you were to look at my roster what attribute, roles etc. would you still say I need? Is investing more in Qingyi, a good idea if I like and plan to continuing playing her? What about if I’m strongly considering Trigger down the line? Is that robot idol still coming out and will she still be ether anomaly?!?!

Tl;dr - Torn between “future-proofing” my account and how, or bricking my account on two electric stunners?
