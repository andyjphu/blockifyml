"Feeling disheartened, is there really any point?",uklaw,1i8db9x,2025-01-23 15:36:21,9,0.76,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklaw/comments/1i8db9x/feeling_disheartened_is_there_really_any_point/,Proud_Obligation1598,,"Hey everyone.  
  
I'm a first-year undergraduate at the University of Aberdeen. My work placements to date have been a week shadowing 2 barristers in the High Courts of London and working in a smaller but notable Highstreet Firm in Belfast specializing in Criminal law, Medical Negligence, Family law, Litigation, and Conveyancing.  
For some background information, I achieved relatively highly on my GCSEs (888877765) but screwed up my A Levels (BBD in Maths, Music and Biology. I dropped Chemistry after Year 12 due to it being too much work for me) as my parents wanted me to study medicine and forced me to do the related subjects (albeit Music because I have a diploma in piano etc) whilst my strengths lay in Literature-based subjects.  
I managed to scrape my way into Aberdeen through clearing and have achieved a comfortable first on all of my first-semester modules as well as just begun working at the local Citizens Advice Bureau.  
  
My problem arises that whilst I have been consistently labelled as ""eager"" and ""proactive,"" as I am navigating the many avenues that my Law Degree can take me, I already have the impression from other undergrads on LinkedIn and other Law Student Forums that pursuing any opportunities in Commercial and Corporate law are at a dead end for me due to my especially poor A level results and the University I go to. In all honesty, I was just grateful to get into University anyway, and due to how much work and tears I shed at A Level I find myself feeling unusually comfortable with the adjustment to degree level.  
  
However, I feel that even though I feel like I am thriving in my higher academic position, receiving several work-experience opportunities as a first year, and that A levels are not representative of my potential, I fear that many competitive and larger firms will simply ignore any valid reasons or strengths I have shown just because of my A level grades. Because of this, I'm unsure whether there is any point in me even beginning to pursue an interest at a Magic/Silver Circle or any BigLaw firm as I would simply be represented by a series of bad grades that didn't go my way due to very nuanced reasons.  
  
That being said, I have found that my skill set lies primarily in the fact that I can work with and talk to absolutely anyone (I have been asked several times why do I not pursue a career in sales instead) and have developed this by previously having volunteered in a severely understaffed hospital ward and grown up around with a very diverse community (meaning I've effectively had to adapt to suit anyone's preferences).  
This is why even as a first year, I feel that I excel in 'networking' and creating lasting impressions on senior Law figures and have also managed to receive a 1-week placement with Dyson's IP department and potentially a connection and placement at¬†Eversheds Sutherland¬†(and also the placements mentioned at the top of my post).  


Unfortunately, I feel this key strength of mine is irrelevant to any big city firm and have slowly been saddened at the prospect that I may never work for a notable firm. I have a genuine interest in global commercial affairs but I feel like this doesn't make a difference.  
  
Is there any point in me even looking at this forum, open days or opportunities concerning Corporate Law anymore? What's the point if all of my skills are buried beneath my crap A levels.  
  
I am not looking for any sympathy and apologize if it has come across to anyone that I am looking for it. I thought I had gotten past the pitfalls of being judged for my grades and that thriving in my Law degree would be enough but I am coming to the realization that none of that matters

Edit: I ended up smashing all of my first semester exams and getting 84% average so I'm not so worried anymore, thanks for the advice everyone!"

Commercial BTL,uklandlords,1hu7u06,2025-01-05 09:10:28,2,0.75,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklandlords/comments/1hu7u06/commercial_btl/,GT_Running,,"I am thinking of a purchase of 3 shops on a highstreet.  I'm wondering if anyone has any experience.  The only commercial experience I have is when I leased a shop myself and it was generally fine with the landlord.

The units are all let.  1 to a large company discount chemist store,  1 to a big chain bakery, 1 to an independent kebab shop.  All are established and have 5yr leases.  The purchase cost is ¬£600k and the rental income is 10% yield of ¬£60k.

I can fund 60% from selling a residential BTL that has a crappy 3% yield.  I will try to loan the rest.

Pros:  
-  high yield, 
-  fully repairing and insuring terms.  
-  More hands-off than residential BTL (assumed).

Cons:  
-  Void periods mean I will have to pay the business rates.  
-  Big companies forcing rent renegotiation / small company (kebab shop) defaulting maybe.  
-  Maybe difficult to get out as there is limited buyers (on the market over 6 months now).

I'd love to hear from people who have done this and if it was a success.

Suggestion for similar upgrade,sunglasses,1hcy11h,2024-12-12 18:03:37,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunglasses/comments/1hcy11h/suggestion_for_similar_upgrade/,8chofmann,,"TL;DR: Searching for high quality alternative to [my old(ish) Ray-Bans](https://i.imgur.com/OGAG4ts.jpeg)

I have always loved the way that the Ray-Bans above look on my face and want to splurge on a similar pair with better craftsmanship. After putting the image above in Google Lens, it led me to thinking these were likely Ray-Ban [RB3477](https://www.eyeglassx.com/Ray-Ban-New-Highstreet-RB3477-p/rb3477-004.htm). 

I ordered a pair of [Randolph Aviators in 55m](https://www.randolphusa.com/products/aviator-matte-chrome-american-gray?variant=41396549025932) which ended up being too small on my face and looking like goggles. I should have measured the lens and hinge-to-hinge distance on the Ray-Bans to realize ~58mm and ~146mm would fit my face better. I'm now considering the same Randolph Aviators in 58mm, but also realize something like the [Randolph Corsair](https://www.randolphusa.com/products/corsair-gunmetal-agx) might be more similar in shape. The issue I have with the Corsair is that I want silver frames and gray lenses (not an offered combination, but maybe AXG is not as green as I think?) and though that bayonet temples seemed cool. I would appreciate any advice or input on models to consider. Thank you!"

It comes earlier every year, the bombardment of festive fakery that‚Äôs crammed down everyone‚Äôs throats for weeks on end. Every Halloween product is shoved into a little recess while isles and isles of gaudy tatt surrounds it in stores. Everywhere you go there‚Äôs that fat jolly fucker decked out in the colours the coka cola industry gave him along with the artificial Christmas trees and cheap baubles.

Its consumerism given free reign and there‚Äôs no getting away from it as its on the high street with its tattered Christmas lights that have been up all year round just waiting for the local council to cough up whichever D list celebrity they found to parade around for the switch on event. It creeps onto every radio station with the same Christmas songs on repeat with increasing intensity until you feel like you‚Äôve entered a fever dream.

Every tv station starts to churn out the adverts showing the same family gathered around a table straining under the weight of food that one family couldn‚Äôt possibly eat in a week, shit eating grins plastered below their flimsy paper hats as they carve their bland, tasteless turkey. Another one showing a family in matching pyjamas sitting around a massive elaborately decorated Christmas tree, gurning at each other as they pass artistly decorated parcels to their kids.

Its all bullshit rudely shoved in everyone‚Äôs faces of hey look! This is what everyone‚Äôs Christmas should look like! This is the unattainable goal everyone should strive for and fuck you if it doesn‚Äôt end up like that. Fuck the families that get together and do nothing but argue and snap at each other all day, fuck the kids pitching a fit because their parents couldn‚Äôt afford the overpriced plastic rubbish that‚Äôs being peddled this year, fuck the elderly which no one left, fuck the outcasts and mentally ill just trying to get through it all and what really boils my piss is the day itself.

when the tv airs its big Christmas special event that‚Äôs usually filmed in July. It has that little blurb before the adverts encouraging people to not end it all, to ring this helpful little telephone number so you won‚Äôt swan dive off the mortal coil after the festive beating the media has inflicted has taken its toll. When you have been bombarded with adverts showing fake families enjoying fake food with fake presents, laughing and smiling and reminding you over and over again that you are alone. Its cruel, cruel and senseless but go ahead and ring that helpline while we put the ad‚Äôs on from pizzahut and their festive pizza deal for the millionth time.

Its one day. One day with an out of control build up that brings some people to the brink of suicide, families into major debt, people sink into depression and are riddled with stress. All to recreate the portrait the media paints that is 100% fake.

Its certainly not about the festive spirit anymore, having worked in retail in my early years I can certainly attest to that. People get plain mean at this time and will take out their frustrations on the nearest available target. The Highstreet heaves with people jostling and shoving their way along, dragging screaming kids and their prams. It is the vision of a nightmare for me and many others.

Then there‚Äôs the waste.

In my line of work I see it at its worst which recycling centre literally buried under mounds and mounds of wrapping paper, packaging, delivery boxes, Christmas cards, pre-Christmas clear outs, decorations, dying Christmas trees, food scraps and broken toys.  I still have pictures of a site where the piles where over seven foot tall and people turning up and hurling stuff straight into the pile.

Its disgusting.

But despite my seething irritation about this time of year I still play ball striving mightily to come up with gift ideas, buy the pointless wrapping paper for cheap and then curse and snarl when it inevitably tears, slapbox myself violently in a doomed attempt at removing glitter from my person, attend the work Christmas night out for a socially acceptable amount of time before beating a hasty retreat, travel to my family to be in attendance for the big day, be dragged by the collar out of the sofa bed at the crack of dawn to be marched about from one relatives house to another until well into the night, stamp a smile onto my face while I answer the same arbitrary questions from people I haven‚Äôt seen for 12 months and maintain the herculean effort of presenting myself as a functional member of society in fear I may insult or upset someone by being..well me.

I only insist on one thing at this time of year, just one thing and I care not a jot what people think when I do it but its MY Christmas tradition that at the first glimpse of that jolly bearded twat I see  hanging there as a store decoration I will immediately and with extreme passion punch it violently right in its ruddy fat face.

Using the concept of more expensive items elevate your brand in this arena isn't a smart play. 

If you want to make more money then start selling packs at at least half the price of what they are now, really they should be under 1000 credits. 

- A new car 500 max
- A new car with wheels and decals 800 max
- A new car with wheels, decals,  a goal explosion and boosts, etc 1000 max
- A older legacy car 300 max
- A premium branded car 800 to 1000 max. 

- Wheels 50 to 100
- Decals 100 to 200
- Goal explosions 500 MAX
- Boosts, trails and toppers, 250 max
- Music tracks 200 to 500 Max (depending on licence cost)

If I can accurately model, UV map, and texture a RL car I blender in 5 hours, then that doesn't exactly warrant a price tag of $20 per person. It is unrealistic, and I have the money to burn on these items, I used to pick up stuff from the store all the time, but don't think I've spent any money in the store in about 6 to 9 months because your pricing is now kinda feels like a disgusting money grab, especially given you aren't really addressing the issues with the game or brining anything much new to the table for the players.

Homelessness temporary Accommodation and wrongful eviction St Albans council.,HousingUK,1guzb6d,2024-11-19 10:09:20,0,0.4,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1guzb6d/homelessness_temporary_accommodation_and_wrongful/,Tiny-Debate2000,,"I female but won't say my age or how old my 2 under 2 children are to protect my identity.

I applied to St Albans council under homelessness application as I was fleeing domestic violence and was advised through the police and domestic violence assist as well as SADA to apply to the council as on maternity leave and wouldn't be able to afford to go into refuge.

I applied that at first denied my application stating I said he was in prison which I did not! Proof with emails.

I was told to reapply as things got cross wired. They then put my in temporary accommodation in premier inn on St Albans high street.

I moved in very gratefully 7/10/2024 Was told to apply for housing benefits as I'm on maternity and not due back at work (nhs) till January 2025.

I would call and ask about my application and they just told me to look at private renting. I had been applying for hear to private rent and I can't due to the dv and getting ccjs etc.

In this area rent is 1850+ for a 2 bed property and I make less than that a month!
They said I would be entitled to 1240 help towards rent and I cover the rest but teh probably is landlords won't accept me due to ccjs, wanting me to earns 3x monthly rent and to have a guarentour who earns over 57k a year... I don't have this nor meet that criteria.

None the less I have been applying to over 40+ property's and views 5 as some even said don't bother.

My eldest child has been being assessed but due to her age it's difficult and from what she has witnessed she tend to physicall assault me and her younger sibling all the time, causing injury to herself through headbutting things, biting, smacking her self and meltdowns with screaming for endless amounts of time.

I have told the council of this they are aware. I also have health conditions I.e - crohns, anxiety, panic attack disorder.

I then got a call at 11:00 on 14/10/2024 saying I was being rebooked to another hotel down the road and needed to be out of this one with my 2 children and all belongings at 12:00 including a cot and bags of clothes etc.

I had no notice and couldn't get family to help me I was in tears all over the place calling asking how I was supposed to do all of that in short notice or I would be charged. 

The booking was for travelodge on St Albans highstreet and check in wasn't until 14/10/24 3pm so if I could manage to pack all the stuff and then wait with it somewhere on street (raining) for 3hrs...

I had to pack it all and take to hallways and wait for my family to come when they could. I then checked in at 3 at travelodge. 

I'm very grateful but these facilities is just a bed, bath same as last, it's very difficult to feed small children with no facility's and I couldn't afford to go out to eat. Baby milk alone for a tin is ¬£13.50 x 6 a month is ¬£81 alone and nappy's cost me ¬£30 a month too, so the thought of going out to eat constantly is just madness so I bought cereal and bowls etc, and was buying small milk cartoon and keeping cool in water in sink in bathroom and then buying new every 2 days.. for lunch I was doing noodles with kettle but my eldest who has extra needs would lash out from the food so I got a microwave in the room (not realising it was in the tenancy agreement not to) I do understand the fire stafty issue but I use and unplug never left on unattended.

My daughter have both had a bug giving it to me making my chrome flare up.
My mum was also ill and she has lupus amongst other health conditions so I went over to help her etc and she's ended up in hospital etc when I returned back someone had been in my room lights were on and window open and remote to the tv had gone I called my mum as it weirded me out. 

The booking got extended another 2 weeks on the morning off my booking ended a hour before I got the call to say had been extended. I call to say will it be same place they said they hope so but they will see. It was but they said I might still have to ch age room that was a 30 second notice and I call 2 days before asking if they could maybe do it earlier so that I could speak with the hotel and arrange etc.

I got to stay in that hotel luckily and I called to ask if I could stay in the same room they said yes.

When trying to contact and speak to the council they would be very rude and condicending towards me to the point I asked if my mother or her partner could speak on my behalf they were also told I was a liar as they would tell me in short notice to move hotel and when told by my mothers partner that they have even been rude to him and he's calling from his work and calls are recorded they changed their tone and said they would give him a call regarding the complaint he wanted to make.

Never received a call back.

Another day I was getting ready to go do uni work and my children were sleeping I heard a fire alarm and then another and then another I've grabbed my children (scaring them) and ran out in tear and as I'm running I hear fire alarms going off in loads of rooms I see a man get into a lift ( I know not to do this in a state of a fire ) but in panic did it seeing a man get into one too. When I got downstairs I was wondering where to stand or what to do and nobody was panicking 3 people who were downstairs I went to the desk and said is their not a fire ? She said no! It wa just a drill it only went 2 times. Mine went off 3 times in my room I said .. I was sobbing in tears my children were afraid and barely dressed and then to be told it happens every Monday when I had been here for 2 Mondays now and I didn't encounter it and wasn't aware of it. 

Made to feel stupid I left just like that.
Embarrassed.

Following days after I had a child toy disappear I reported it as was told cleaning was between 7-10am on my floor and I left to go out late afternoon and my bed had been made (not mad, very well appreciated) just found wierd considering the times and the remote had gone so called   To report the toy and get new remote. My door then was nemerously checked at 7pm when I wa sin bathroom with my children (in the bath) and on the phone (to my mum) and I said someone is trying my door and loads of times. Then stopped. I reported. They only said it was probably a guest getting the wrong door. 

I then have had a rough few days going back and forth with police and was contacted by my abusers (new girlfriend) I advised her to check Clare's law - she did - I was also contacted finding out information I didn't even know that made me feel very unwell. 

I then also have to report what could be another crime toward me from him from what his new parter told me.

I report to the police.

I then get told he is literally going to be a 5 minute walk from me that morning and I was so scared and worried I grabbed my children got them ready and went straight to mums house so I wasn't near him, leaving in a rush 18/10/2024 13:10.

I get a call at 16:40 from council my housing officer stating the room was very unkept and I had breeched contract of having a microwave and other cooking appliances like a kettle...

I stated the kettle was with every room and the microwave was in fact mine as I don't realise it was in the contract and I would remove it straight away now but how was I supposed to cook for my children? He then told me I should eat out everyday that's what I'm supposed to do I said but I wouldn't be able to afford it and he said well thats not really his problem. 

By 17:10 I was at the hotel with my mum I gave her the microwave to take and bagged the dirty washing that I was supposed to take launderette and put the bin outside then the room was clean.

The room is never not tidy and clean! 
I clean constanly!! I even had photos of my children crawling round with times and dates that I sent to the council when they seen me 'the photos' in the photos u can see the bed has been stripped ( my child split a drink) and clothes in one pile on floor and bathroom they were what I was bagging to go launderette, and then a bin in the corner with nappy's in and new roll of bing bags next to it.

 On the floor was new nappy's my child had thrown out the bag when having a tantrum etc and toys all about. 

Bins get taken sometimes and sometimes don't when I put them out but if they don't get taken I have brought them back in so I can get the pram past. 

I left in a hurry due to being scared. But as I said loads of proof the room is prestine all the other times.

It also said in notice they can keep me in a hotel up to 57 day and then they will have to help and interveane. It's been 44 days and they have evicted me due to this.

What can I do... I am emailing local MP but who else can help me with this situation? "

I own a couple of poke shops in the lower mainland and am looking at opening one in HighStreet. 

Just looking for some feedback from you guys on if you think that would be a good idea based on your experience at the mall.

I heard a lot of the residents are mainly east Indian in that area and they don't typically eat raw fish. 

Any feedback would be much appreciated. 

Cheers!

Enjoy.

Inside the island's centre of commerce a grandiose ‚ÄúWelcome to Werna!‚Äù echoed throughout its central hall, its portly controller trying to impress the latest resident. It would have worked, if not for a light whistle-come-laugh from the old exterminator who had accompanied the human. The fact the pudgy Yotul bothered to wear his official uniform of ornate black furred and gold lined waistcoat amused the bird more than it should have, the introduction pushing the exterminator into laughter.¬†  
Trying to keep an air of authority the portly fellow turned to the bird and asked ‚ÄúDo I amuse you?‚Äù  
Relka managed to stifle his giggles, replying¬† ‚ÄúPerish the thought, I was thinking back to an old show. Please carry on.‚Äù  
The controller held back from vocalising his own thoughts, *This is why I don‚Äôt like your kind, I have no real control!* Losing face in front of the new resident was the last thing he wanted.  
Turning back to Damian he continued on ‚ÄúIt pleases me to know other races are interested in this little island. I believe you have received instructions from Kellas about your task here, yes? You should find all the required materials in the dwelling I personally supplied for your use.‚Äù  
A series of ear flicks and tail movements now passed between the three Yotuls in the room, Damian noting the odd exchange between the controller, Denna and Elna. A single tail thump from the fat Yotul finished whatever was being communicated.¬†

‚ÄúElna, can you guide him around the town today? I would have loved to have done it myself but I fear no time can be spared from my own duties‚Ä¶‚Äù  
With a happy ear flick and tail sway Elna confirmed as such.  
‚ÄúNow Mr Jones, I wish I had more time to chat with you, but I really must be getting back to work. I‚Äôm sure these three will help you settle in.‚Äù  
The trio gave an ear flick and beak clack in affirmation as the controller left for his office,¬† tail swaying all the while.¬†¬†

As the group left the hall Damian noted the wood carvings and paintings that lined the walls, each depicting events of the island's history. One in particular stood out from the cheerful scenes of boats, farmers, mines and sea. On the canvas a large group of islanders faced a cliff edge, the centre of attention being a lone person wearing the same garments as the controller. Dark storm clouds ominously filled the sky.

Noticing the human had stopped at this particular painting Relka remarked; ‚ÄúTrust a predator to take interest in that.‚Äù

Denna smacked the bird with his tail in annoyance ‚ÄúDon't tease him!‚Äù then turned his attention to Damian, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs titled ‚ÄòJudgement,‚Äô and depicts a dark moment of our history‚Ä¶ a reminder.‚Äù

In a louder voice Relka added ‚ÄúA reminder that a controller serves his people, and that he isn't above the law.‚Äù

A cough could be heard coming from the controller's office while the sole human wondered what this island had in store.

¬†

Among the buildings of Werna a single human was having a tour of the highstreet, Elna being his guide and talking about what shop was what and who owned it. Damian noted a few things as this was happening:  
The silver suited bird followed a distance behind, seemingly monitoring him.  
The general lack of people, though a few could be seen peeking from behind curtains and from around corners of buildings.  
Though on the surface the town looked well kept, neglected and abandoned buildings could be seen scattered throughout, something Elna tried to hurry over.

Now at the sea wall and looking into the harbour, Elnas commentary continued ‚Äú... and that over there is the last ship of Werna, ¬†*Progress.* Be careful of its captain, he has a fierce temper.‚Äù  
Damian would have loved to ask some questions about the curious looking ship, however as soon as she finished one thing they would be off to the next. Unexpectedly Relka was the one to put the brakes on proceedings, ‚ÄúGive the lad a rest, you're going to pull his arm off at this rate.‚Äù¬†  
Elnas ears flattened, and once the old bird caught up she excused herself to bring some refreshments from a nearby building. Her energy and enthusiasm throughout the tour had not been lost on the newcomer, leading him to ask Relka ‚ÄúIs she always like this?‚Äù

Finding a bench outside a small hardware shop, the old exterminator rested his legs before replying ‚ÄúNo. Last time she was this excited she had just learned to run without falling.‚Äù

Now Damian wandered over to investigate the shops wares as he pondered over Relkas reply. While studying the various tin items lining the window he hadn't noticed a grey Yotul coming from behind, rapidly pulling the man inside the shop with the human narrowly avoiding hitting his head into the doorframe.  
Once inside the dull grey Yotul, somewhat hunched over and equipped with glasses, exclaimed ‚ÄúWelcome to Aarla wares! My, you are a tall one‚Ä¶You must be one of those new species, Gojid isn't it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, human.‚Äù

With ears half cocked the shopkeeper continued¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that dear‚Ä¶ But it's so exciting, we now have two new species here. Who said this town was finished!‚Äù¬†

Struggling to comprehend how to reply to such a statement he turned his attention to what was around the store. Wooden pigeon holes filled with hardware lined the walls, shelves carrying various glass jars of unknown contents, and each beam seemed to have some type of pot or pan suspended from it, all giving him a strange museum-esque vibe.

‚ÄúForgive me if you need any special orders, you will have to wait until my son returns. He's helping out with the other newcomers' place‚Ä¶ now what were they called‚Ä¶ Ah yes, apes! Now what can I help you with?‚Äù

Ignoring the remark and trying to be polite he replied only browsing due to the lack of credit situation, this resulted in him being shooed out from the premises with a stern warning of not coming back until credits had been found.

Relka witnessed the man rapidly coming out of the building, breaking out into whistling laughter when the human asked ‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù

Elna could now be seen walking back, ears half cocked due to the whistling, with a jug and some tin mugs. Upon her return she questioned ‚ÄúHow the Denkin did you make him laugh?‚Äù

The reply of ‚ÄúApparently I‚Äôm a Gojid‚Äù while gesturing to the shop only served to make the bird's laughter even louder.

‚ÄúPure grey shopkeeper? That would be Jallna. Please be patient with her, she's old and her sight is very poor, hearing isn't far behind either.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why a Gojid?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe would have only seen other Yotul, Farsul and Krakotl before her sight failed. It could have been worse, you could have been called an Arxur.‚Äù

Relka just about managed to speak between laughs ‚ÄúBy the gods, a Gojid!‚Äù

Elna decanted some of the jugs contents while ignoring the loudly whistling bird, passing a cup of cloudy liquid¬† to the man while reassuring it was safe. At this point it seemed like every person who could hear Relka had stepped out of their respective premises, and were now looking down the high street to see what was going on. Noticing this Elna batted the old exterminator to get his attention, ‚ÄúRelka shut your beak! Look!‚Äù

Realising all eyes were now on the trio the old exterminator gave a cough and flutter, rising from the bench and gesturing to the human.

‚ÄúThis is the Island's latest resident. His name is Damian and is of the human species. If anyone wants to ask questions or talk to him, I recommend you do it now while I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

After a brief moment of silence one of the residents slowly walked to the trio, gave the human a good look over and asked loudly ‚ÄúWhere's your tail?‚Äù

It was going to be a long day of answering questions for the human.

Xxxxxxxxx

‚Äú...if you need anything, come find us.‚Äù

These were Denna‚Äôs parting words after showing the small cottage to its latest resident. Stood inside the front doorway Damian finally could stop and think; *so this is my home now.*  
It had been apparent everything involving its modifications had been done in a rush, the smell of white wash and oiled wood hanging in the air‚Ä¶ but it was clear the grey nosed Yotul was proud of his and his friends' work. *It‚Äôs better than Josh‚Äôs flat.*  
The thought initially amused him, remembering how proud his old college friend was upon getting a flat in London, a flat that no sane person would have contemplated. The amusement¬† soon turned to sorrow as he remembered what happened to the capital. *Poor bastard, I hope you didn't suffer.*  
Moving to the bed he mused over how screwed up the universe was.¬†Pulling a bunch of coarse blankets over himself he attempted to get some sleep in the now fading light.

xxxxxxxxx

Elna, slumped over a time worn bench in the little workshop, was half watching what her father was doing through the evening. As time passed Denna noticed his daughter's odd mood from the subtle ear twitches she gave.

‚ÄúWhat's wrong fluff? I thought you would be happy now he‚Äôs here.‚Äù

‚Äú...I should be with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour mother would beg to differ.‚Äù

¬†An annoyed tail thump and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a joey!‚Äù being the woman's response.

‚ÄúI know, but we have already talked about this. While you're still under this roof try not to antagonise her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you siding with her?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI just want an easy life.‚Äù

Another annoyed tail thump followed. ‚ÄúHow would you feel if you arrived alone on an alien planet?‚Äù

‚ÄúStop worrying. The notes say he‚Äôs been living alone for a few years? Cycles? Either way he isn't a joey and doesn't need coddling.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat's that got to do with anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe seems to like the cottage, if he hated it I would understand your worry. Thank Ralchi he is nothing like the feds.‚Äù A joyful tail sway accompanied this statement, only to be met with an icy glare from his daughter.¬†

‚ÄúYou're missing the point. Do you know what someone asked him earlier when you weren't around?‚Äù¬†

Denna flicked his ears signalling her to continue.

‚ÄúThey asked him if they ate their own young if they were born defective!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere the Denkin did *that* come from?‚Äù

‚ÄúThank Ralchi Relka was there to explain the empathy tests when they refused to listen to me.‚Äù

More tail thumps followed.

‚ÄúHow would anybody feel after being asked such nasty things? I wouldn't blame him for thinking of us as a bunch of primitives!‚Äù

With a sigh and defeated ear waggle Denna muttered ‚ÄúOkay... okay, I didn't know. Go check on him, just be quick and promise me to be back before your mother gets home‚Ä¶ I really can't deal with the earache if she finds out.‚Äù

A quick nuzzle and ‚ÄúLove you pa!‚Äù preceded her leaving the building.

It was only a relatively short distance between the two properties, and soon she was outside the cottage's door, noting no lights from within and now worried if the human was asleep. After a few moments debating if to knock she settled on giving it a few light taps and seeing if there was a response.

On the verge of returning home the door opened, two half open steel grey eyes looking down at her and a groggy ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's what I should be asking you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through all that earlier‚Ä¶they didn't mean anything bad by asking you those things.‚Äù

Though it hadn't been a pleasant experience for the man, he viewed it as a positive. No local had tried to burn him or ran off screaming‚Ä¶ the time on Venlil Prime being infinitely more traumatic.

‚ÄúI've known worse, please don't worry about it.‚Äù

He noted her ears gave a slight twitch as if to acknowledge his words, but seemingly she couldn't bring herself to say anything else. An uncomfortable silence descended as she looked down at the ground, struggling to find the words she wanted to say.

‚ÄúElna, I'm tired. Frankly I can't do any guessing of body languages let alone mind reading. Please say or do whatever it is.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you have to be alone here.‚Äù

The voice was so low he could only just about hear it, letting out a sigh he slowly placed a hand on her shoulder.

‚ÄúBeing alone isn't anything new to me, and you're all just down the path so don't worry.‚Äù¬†

She now looked back up to the man ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

Not sure how best to allay her concerns he gave her a gentle hug, ‚ÄúI will still be here in the morning.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, I will be fine.‚Äù"
Irritation acne when switching Tret brands?,tretinoin,1ggncx1,2024-10-31 15:51:18,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/1ggncx1/irritation_acne_when_switching_tret_brands/,cronenbergbliss,Personal / Miscellaneous,"I was previously using Retino-A .05% (manufacturer Encube Ethicals) from All Day Chemist with great success. They have been out of stock for some time, so I bought Tretin-0.05% (H&H) from HighStreet Pharma.  Suddenly I had some sever acne on my forehead and eyebrows.  Not pimples where things are bubbling up like purging, but like hard red sore pimples you can't squeeze.  I have bangs and this was all along where my hair touches my face.  I have stopped using tret  until things heal, but prior to this I had been a consistent user for 3+ years.

My question is:  Has anyone else had a reaction such as this when switching brands?  Both were creams.  Does anyone know if there is an issue with the products coming from HighStreet?"

Herein, we explore Highstreet's market performance, tokenomics, and its integration of virtual reality to redefine shopping. We examine its governance model, where HIGH token holders steer future developments, and assess the token's volatility and market sentiment through a synthesis of technical analysis and real-time social sentiment from X posts. The study aims to project Highstreet's potential in reshaping retail, gaming, and investment landscapes within the metaverse, considering both its innovative strides and the speculative nature of its ecosystem. This analysis serves as a beacon for investors navigating the nebulous waters of crypto-gaming investments, offering a glimpse into Highstreet's virtual yet very tangible economic prospects.

[COMPARISON] üåûHermes Gamma Belt 13 mm. Auth/Rep üëÄüëÄüåû,WagoonLadies,1focu53,2024-09-24 09:44:05,241,0.99,45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1focu53,Fashionfobic,Reference,"I'm back again with a small comparison of my authentic Hermes 13 mm gamma belt - reversible Bleu Fonc√©/ Craie with rose gold buckle in sz. 70 cm.
I have been enjoying the belt so much that it's now a stable in my wardrobe and looks great on many different types of outfits.

I decided to try the rep version of this style in a different color way and with a different color buckle .

I tried my luck with my seller Tong ( one of my long time go-to for shoes, bags and miscellaneous)
and by now she is one of my favorite sellers for belts. üåû

She had the belt available, but the smallest size they make is a Chinese 90 (EU80) see the measurements in my pictures for clarification üò¨

Tong WhatsApp: +86 13903077064

Priced at 520 cny (74 $)
I ordered 2 belts 
1 for me in Etoupe epsom/ Noir swift ( then one I show in the pictures)
1 for my daughter in Gold Epsom/ Noir Swift
Shipping was 260 cny for the 2 belts.

I paid with PPFF as I always do with all sellers ..üí∞üòé

I was very very positively surprised upon receiving them as they are very very close to the authentic.
The buckle is very slightly bigger than auth. but absolutely not noticeable, not even when I handle them side by side. AND I candvuse the authentic buckle on my Rep and vice versa - it fits perfectly the holes.
The belt itself is a little thicker than the authentic.
The three holes are slightly more spaced on the rep and the rep doesn't come in 70 cm. so I had to punch more holes for it to fit me üòéüôà
The craftsman stamp is very similar to the authentic..( small so I have a had time seeing them anyway ) so it could have been much more different without me noticing üò¨üòúü§™.....
Well because I love this belt do much, I ordered 2 more 13 mm. belts from Tong, but with different color and buckles ( see my pictures)
However I find the quality of these 2 to be slightly lower than my first rep. 
1. The stitches are longer
2. the Stamp is larger 
3. Length is the same 
Overall no big deal but I had to mention - I added description to my pictures to guide you better.

Just very recently I added a final 13 mm. belt to my collection, but I decided to try my clothing go-to Didi, just to see what she could offer in terms of quality and price üí∞ üíµ üí∞ üíµ 

She offered me a lower price of 35 $ ( sending it with a bunch of other stuff) so I went for it in a black with white stitches on one side and all black on the other side.
A completely different chained d'ancre buckle in gold 

I have received this belt recently and it's the same measurements as my Tong belts. 
similar quality leather and buckle but it's buckle hole is set further from the end of the strap compared to both authentic and Tong version....Which disturbs me slightly - the belt is still great quality it's just not identical to the authentic in terms of holes + the stamp is way larger and deeper.
nothing that anyone would notice unless seen side by side with authentic... 

The one more negative thing about this belt is that the holes and the buckle pin are bigger than the authentic and Tong belts so I can't interchange this buckle with my other straps ...no biggie but still it would have been nice to be able to do that. üò¨üòé‚ô•Ô∏è

And now for the EYE CANDY üç¨ üç≠ üëÄ üëÄ 

Check below üëá for a bunch of comparison pictures and Close-ups:
https://imgur.com/a/ceqe1eJ

Thank you all for reading my post üåû - I truly hope it's useful for you as I don't see too many posts about the more rare kinds of belts and accessories...So I love to give back from my year long experience with reps - Most of my rep knowledge I got from the RL sub and these newer subs. Before digging into reps I was a stable authentic customer for many many years.

I ONLY like highest quality reps that won't stand out as reps, but I don't nit pick on small details or inconsistencies that no one would ever see unless they're an authenticator with a magnifier üòéüòéüôàüôà

The things I buy fit my lifestyle and I try to mix high end reps with authentics and highstreet to achieve what I call the
""OLD MONEY FUNKY"" style üòúüòé

Have a good one out there - Wear what you like and F*CK all the jealous eyes üëÄ You ROCK ‚ù§Ô∏è

On the one hand, I mostly bank electronically, and the digital banks also tend to have nice perks like no foreign transaction fees. On the other hand, I like having the option to go to a physical branch, particularly for deposits and withdrawals, even if I might not use it much. No fees is a must either way. 

The main ones I've really found appealing are Starling for a digital bank since it has a lot of perks like no foreign conversion fees if I go on trips and you can even deposit at the post office, and HSBC for a highstreet bank because they offer an account specifically for international students and is well suited for receiving money from Canada.

I also know of Monzo and Wise in the digital space, but I used Monzo back when I did an exchange here a few years ago and while it was OK, it felt a bit like a ""freemium service"" with all these ads for Premium, and depositing money was really awkward. As for Wise, I already use them to receive money from Canada and they're great but I want a separate account for receiving monies from the UK. I also don't believe you can use them for deposits either. 

Anyway interested in your thoughts on this. Which method do you think is better? And which bank do I go with? There are a lot more banks here than in Canada so I'm kinda overwhelmed for choice here"

I have been offered a mortgage for a 5 year fixed at 6.25%. 

Given that if I waited another year the 2 defaults will drop off so I will be likely to be able to approach those highstreet lenders and get a much better rate, increase deposit and pay down some debts.

[Corporate Greed in a Small Town](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2531vm/corporate_greed_in_a_small_town/) May 8, 2014



This is not as much a tale as a situation that is currently happening in my home town. I don't live there anymore, but my parents do, and this info all comes from them. I suppose this is not directly retail related, but it seems at least¬†*somewhat*¬†appropriate for this sub.

There is a man (let's call him ""Bob"") who owned a franchised electronics store in my home town. Now, this town is very small (\~4500 people), yet this store drives a lot of business. In fact, this store was apparently one of the most profitable in the province for the last several years.

Now, the corporate office of this franchise, in their infinite wisdom, decided that the portion of the profits they received from Bob was not enough - nope, they wanted ALL the profit. Therefore, they stripped him of the franchise, built a brand new building on an empty lot, and opened a corporate branch of the franchise.

Unfortunately for the franchise, they didn't understand the reasons WHY Bob's store was so profitable: people like Bob, and they like to support local business. In small towns, big corporations are evil, and people are willing to spend more at a ""family-run"" business than elsewhere.

So what did Bob do? Well, he changed the name of his store from ""Franchise Electronics"" to ""Bob's Electronics"". He continues to sell the same products and offer the same services. Guess what? He continues to get tons of customers and drive tons of business. The corporate franchise store, on the other hand, gets no customers. The franchise geniuses no longer get a portion of Bob's profits and are almost certainly operating at a loss now.  

&nbsp;

***Relevant Comments***:  

  

**chilari**:

>Haha, I love it.    


>I too live in a small town. Not just a small town, but an historic market town. We've got a broken castle and steam trains and everything. Quiet, pretty (we occasionally win prizes for our category in Britain In Bloom, a contest judging tidiness and prettiness of places with a focus on flowers). Last year a certain well known sandwich shop opened on the highstreet. Now, my town has got a few chains. Supermarkets, a bookshop that's part of a chain, a chain coffee shop etc, but most of the high street shops are independent or charity shops. We've got loads of independent cafes too. People here support local businesses.    


>The sandwich shop didn't do well. Even in Saturdays, when the market is on and the town is crowded as anything, the chain sandwich shop was half empty. The only people I ever saw in there were tourists (we get a lot on the steam train coming from the bigger town at the other end of the line) and school kids still in uniform after school. It lasted all of six months. Meanwhile, a cafe that opened around the corner a month or two after the sandwich shop, on a narrow side street in a shop unit that is half the size, is thriving, because it's owned and run by a local.

  
**Elceepo**:

>My town used to be like that until a store I'll call Mallmart came along.    


>It was followed by fast food joints, other stores that like to follow the advance of the Mallmart, and pretty soon we had a direct link to the highway stemming from what used to be a sound buffer forest/wetlands area.    


>The small fry are either eaten by these companies in ""mergers"" or drown. Such is life in this strange economic ecosystem.

  
**ColdfireSC3**:

>I fear the worst for Bob. You see, the corporate store can afford to run a loss. They're not looking to make a profit. What they're doing is take enough customers away that Bobs store isn't profitable enough anymore. Even if they take away only 20% of the customers away that might be enough to run Bob out of business in the long run. And once Bob shuts down they have achieved their objective and taken over his market.

  
**cheestaysfly**:

>I'm confused how ""Bob"" owned the franchise but still had a corporate office that was able to strip him of profits. How?  

  

**Polymarchos**:

>Different franchises operate differently, some just let you use their branding and distribution network, others actually own the store and let you run it for a share of the profits. This would have been the latter.



**Deleted user**:

>Actually, this sounds more like the former. When corporate stripped his franchise, they probably figured the loss of branding and distribution infrastructure would be enough to sink Bob and force a local monopoly. But Bob still had a storefront, inventory, and loyal customers. He didn't need corporate branding because he built his own reputation. The only thing he was missing was a distribution infrastructure similar to that of the corporation. As long as he did a god job with recording his finances, it wouldn't be too hard to convince distributors that he is going to be a high volume store, not just another local startup.

[10 Year Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1eh517p/10_year_update_corporate_greed_in_a_small_town/) July 31, 2024

  
TLDR on the original post: ""Bob"" runs a franchised electronic store in a small town. Corporate takes the franchise away from him because they want a bigger slice of the profits. Bob opens ""Bob's Electronics"" as the franchise opens their own store. All the locals support Bob and shop at his store instead of the new franchise location.

Given it has been 10 years, I had completely forgotten about Bob and his electronics store. As well, all of the relatives that I talk to with any frequency have either died or left my home town. However, my dad visited last week, and so I finally have an update...

After taking the better part of a decade (and likely losing money every year for that entire time), the franchise finally decided that they were never going to be able to get enough of Bob's customers to stay afloat. They closed shop sometime last year.

In the end, Bob won.

We‚Äôre aware people are planning to gather on West Street, Old Market from 7pm and while we will facilitate peaceful protest, we will not tolerate criminality of any kind.

Bristol Commander Superintendent Mark Runacres said: ‚ÄúThere is a lot of speculation on social media about what is going to happen tonight and this has caused a lot of concern among our communities.

‚ÄúTo be clear, at this time we are only aware of plans to gather on West Street.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any intelligence to corroborate rumours that people are coming from outside of the city to demonstrate and we don‚Äôt have any intelligence to corroborate rumours anyone is going to march up Stapleton Road. It is vitally important people do not trust everything they read on social media.

‚ÄúWe saw a post saying we had issued a warning to the community but this is not true. We have not issued any warning.

‚ÄúWe recognise people are concerned and we have put a lot of work into keeping community and business leaders in the city informed and to dispel disinformation and misinformation online.

‚ÄúWe have hundreds of highly trained officers available tonight who are experienced in managing large scale events and incidents of disorder, some of these are being provided by other police forces.

‚ÄúThese officers will be supported by specialist resources from our mounted, dog and drone units.

‚ÄúLike on Saturday, enhanced stop and search powers will be in place under Section 60 and Section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. These will be in place in the area seen in the map from 4pm today (Wednesday 7 August) until 7am tomorrow (Thursday 8 August).

‚ÄúA Section 34 dispersal zone has also been authorised for the same area which will give officers powers to move on groups or individuals causing ‚Äì or who are likely to cause ‚Äì harassment, alarm or distress to others.

‚ÄúI want to be honest with people, we do not know exactly how many people are planning to demonstrate or how they intend to express themselves.

‚ÄúWhat I can say is that we will respond swiftly and dynamically to any incidents of disorder, should they occur, and will use all the powers and tactics available to us to maintain order and keep people safe.

‚ÄúI urge people to let us deal with anyone who is violent, damages property or commits offences motivated by hate. We will not tolerate this behaviour and people can be reassured we will keep you safe.

‚ÄúThose who engage in criminality, will be held accountable and will face the full force of the law.

‚ÄúWe have had a lot of people asking us to give advice on whether to open or close their business, whether to board it up and avoid the area. ‚ÄúThis is not something we would ever advise on. We will provide people with what we know and want be honest about what we don‚Äôt, to enable people to make their own informed decisions.

‚ÄúFinally, I want to reiterate how proud we are to be able to serve all the diverse communities of Bristol.

‚ÄúMany of our officers are from, or live and work, in the city and understand and appreciate its uniqueness and richness.

‚ÄúTogether, we will not let those who seek to cause unrest divide us. They will not win.‚Äù

Workshop mod to add single very slow & strong zombies,projectzomboid,1elaise,2024-08-06 02:19:16,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1elaise/workshop_mod_to_add_single_very_slow_strong/,Occidentally20,Question,"I've been playing with the random zombies mod to give myself 1% sprinters. This keeps them so rare I forget about them and then get scared to death when I meet one.

It also stops me bring able to just gather up all the zombies on muldraugh highstreet and dump them in the woods like I used to rely on.

But does anyone have a setup that can result in a similar 1% chance of a kind of 'boss' zombie that either has incredibly high health, or increased intelligence like opening doors for example?

All the mods I've found seem to add multiple special zombie types and I haven't seen one that I can customise to do this."
Cinepolis HighStreet Mall (Cinemastar) Review July 2024,thane,1ehgic5,2024-08-01 09:20:28,23,0.93,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/thane/comments/1ehgic5/cinepolis_highstreet_mall_cinemastar_review_july/,Vedu7777,Fun,"Hi, so in my defense, I had taken a leave today and decided to watch another movie üòÇ

This time at the classic CinemaStar - the first time a good quality theater came to Thane (in the Modern Era) - also where I watched my first movie in the theaters. 

## Mall
- it's like a huge corporate office campus now
- decent quality 
- take a lift to the third Floor as the escalators have been downgraded to stairs

## Cinepolis Lobby
- as good as (I guess better) than the one in Viviana 
- nice and fresh white and gold interior, it feels like you're in a goood theater
- toilets are also good - up to the Cinepolis standard. 

## Auditorium 
- as soon as you enter the movie audi, you will feel like you're in Viviana only üòÇ
- seats are good and all same to other cinepolis, good quality 
- screen is of the standard size, and picture + 3D quality is good
- sound is also good, didn't face any issue. It's **not** Dolby 7.1 certified, but bass and everything else is as good as any other cinema hall. 
- ***Projector Light leak*** - this is a MAJOR ISSUE at this theater. It was there 8 years ago, it's still here now. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT BOOK THE BACK HALF OF THE THEATER. 
- book towards the front half, especially where the mid-section is. This is the best place to sit where you can recline the seat, and enjoy without streching your neck. Also, being at the center always gives better audio experience. 

## Exit
- quite decent. You get out on the third floor of mall after which you can go to ground floor and have something at the 'cafe' where you'll see corporate employees, or just grab a tea from Society kiosk and go home 
- much better than Winder Mall. 

Overall, this is a good cinema, but ***THE CROWD*** may or may not be an issue based on ticket prices. 

This will give you a proper Cinepolis experience, and the movie experience can also be good if you want to just watch a (thodi sasti) movie near your home and go back. "
New vegan fashion vs thrifted animal products? Recommendations appreciated!,vegan,1e8jdnv,2024-07-21 06:34:35,5,0.59,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1e8jdnv/new_vegan_fashion_vs_thrifted_animal_products/,Littlelegs_505,Clothing & Shoes,"I've always bought high street due to budget, but in the past couple years really scaled back and tried to purchase as much as I can secondhand. I've found a lot of the highstreet stuff I thrift doesn't last well or is uncomfortable, however the slightly 'higher end' stuff I've thrifted (nothing designer, just nicer high street brands like S√©zane or vintage pieces) has been great in terms of comfort and longevity but a lot of it contains animal based fibres, which makes me a little uncomfortable. 

I've been vegan about 10 years and never bought anything non-vegan first hand but I'm not sure how I feel about the ethical nuances of secondhand buying. I don't feel educated enough about the fashion industry to make an informed decision when buying new clothes within my budget, that aren't just greenwashed fast fashion. 

Do you stress about buying only vegan items when thrifting? Do you feel it is better to purchase from the billions of pieces of clothing already in circulation, and buy higher quality secondhand items that may or may not be vegan, but will last longer, and be used more often, and serve you better, or purchase exclusively vegan clothing, even if this means buying new which has it's own issues? 

For example I have bought new brogue shoes from Dr Martens before and the fabric has peeled and never broken in right, whereas I have a pair of thrifted Dr Martens shoes that are leather which have lasted better and are softer so given me more wear. I would love to hear how other people approach this, and would especially love any resources you have on green fashion, and recommendations of high quality vegan brands and fabrics to choose from?"

C Love Highstreet Paranormal,LolcowUSA,1dyjyzx,2024-07-08 16:59:27,3,0.81,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LolcowUSA/comments/1dyjyzx/c_love_highstreet_paranormal/,Cecil_Exposed,,"This is going to be a long post, so I'll have to drop some info a little at a time every day. Allow me to introduce you to a cryptid that goes by several names: Cecil, C Love, Highstreet Paranormal, etc. I'm sure there are other names he's probably used throughout his 10+ years of posting content. He has about as many channels as Fed Smoker, but here are his main ones:

[www.youtube.com/@Paranormaltelivision](http://www.youtube.com/@Paranormaltelivision)

[www.youtube.com/@CLoveHighStreetontheBeat](http://www.youtube.com/@CLoveHighStreetontheBeat)

[www.youtube.com/@covingtonkyhiphop](http://www.youtube.com/@covingtonkyhiphop)

So my story with Cecil starts when I was working a security job. One day, I was informed that there would be a new first shift guy starting that day. In walks a scrawny 5ft tall guy wearing a mask that was so big on his face that it reached his lower eye lids. Over the next couple of weeks, I'd spend an hour at the end of each shift with this guy and he told me all kinds of wild stuff. On one of these occasions, he made the mistake of telling me a ""childhood story"" because there's a group of ""stalkers"" online that spread a ""fake, edited"" video of him telling the SAME EXACT STORY!

[https://youtu.be/EOFwzZN0QX8?si=JZHNSK9uzr2fCsgy](https://youtu.be/EOFwzZN0QX8?si=JZHNSK9uzr2fCsgy)

He told me this same story, only he told me that he was 11, 12, or 13 and the girls were a couple years younger. He told me his channel name during this and mentioned some of the names of his ""haters."" I subbed to his channels and his ""haters"" channels right then. So after I got out of work that day, I did my research. I've been part of his ""haters"" community ever since.

HERE ARE SOME KEY PLAYERS:

This one is his main nemesis: [www.youtube.com/@mastershredder8738](http://www.youtube.com/@mastershredder8738)

This is one of the biggest channels that does high quality content: [www.youtube.com/@RandomNews](http://www.youtube.com/@RandomNews)

Random has a playlist on his channel just for Cecil.

Another high quality channel and this one has interviewed Cecil [www.youtube.com/@scooterbeggins](http://www.youtube.com/@scooterbeggins)

This channel is dedicated to Cecil content and does long form videos: [www.youtube.com/@THECRUSTYRABBITHOLE](http://www.youtube.com/@THECRUSTYRABBITHOLE)

Crusty also has playlists that can help you find more content about Cecil.

Now, I leave you all with a cliffhanger... I interviewed Cecil's sister a year ago and made a channel to present my evidence. She revealed that at the time that she walked in on Cecil and one of the girls, he was 17 and the two girls were 8 and 10. If anyone is interested in seeing said video, DM me for a link.

First Update:

This video speaks for itself when it comes to his behavior around young girls:

[https://youtu.be/LWNQ24pTh8k?si=HEjYq5styi4vVB7b](https://youtu.be/LWNQ24pTh8k?si=HEjYq5styi4vVB7b)

I know exactly who the friend of his daughter in the video is. I have a video on my hard drive of the girl and his daughter ""vouching for him"" about how he's not creepy to little girls. 

Unfortunately, that's all I have for now because there's just so much that this guy has done. I need to set some time aside to collect some of the worst Cecil moments."

Food trucks that don't suck,readingfestival,1dvtn72,2024-07-05 05:06:37,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/readingfestival/comments/1dvtn72/food_trucks_that_dont_suck/,Bulky_Gap_674,,"I was a little dismayed about the quality of the food offerings last year. I initially had high hopes as numerous festivals before had great unique offerings that are hard to find on your Highstreet. Had an amazing goan curry truck at bluedot and bunny chow at download.

On the Friday after walking around what felt like forever, checking out most of the places in the arena I settled on a burrito bar. Unfortunately the burrito was such a bland disappointment, It put me off gambling another ¬£15 for the rest of the festival.

I understand there's a target demographic of teenagers with their parents money, and the numerous chip bars cater perfectly to them. There however seems to be a huge gap in the food vendor offerings where adults/day visitors who are more likely to spend a bit more on food have little choice. Even my local council run fair in the park this year had more variety. 

Rant over, Did you find a hidden gem last year? Is there a special truck from another festival you'd love to see here?"

Partner has a job in London, my job is in Southampton. We're looking for somewhere to buy that facilitates an easy commute to London. We've looked at winchester but are priced out of buying there. Can anyone recommend any other areas to look at where partner can commute easily but there's also a nice highstreet nearby with coffee shops etc.

I've wondered whether colden common is good so that they can get the train from shawford into Winchester for the High street but don't really know where else to look tbh or if there's any other reasonable place in the area"

Unlike Senior High na one episode palang ma hohook ka na. I don't know pero parang ang corny/OA ng storyline. I hope nag focus nalang sa issue ni Tim at Poch kasi may relevant ang issue ng LGBT+ Couple. Or ung kay Roxy and Archie, which centered on teen age pregnancy and its effects. Sana naman sa Next Arc or Book ito na ang i tackle. Dapat maging matalino na ang mga Teleserye sa Pilipinas, they should use the Teleserye as a platform to educate the viewers. Ung current storyline was just a waste of time. The current story line fails to be as relevant as Senior High which tackles relevant issue of the Gen z (Mental health, identity crisis, bullying etc.) Sana naman tigilan na yang Gov Acosta - Sky Fued Storyline na yan, wala tayong makukuha dyan. Lastly, kaya naman nag trend ang Senior High Because of #Roxchie at #TimPoch, DreamScape owe it to these fandom kaya may High Street, kaya sana sila ang mahighlight sa Highstreet. Yun Lang.

High street scan vs Drum scans - which do you prefer?,AnalogCommunity,1d88npb,2024-06-04 17:25:36,0,0.5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/1d88npb/high_street_scan_vs_drum_scans_which_do_you_prefer/,wolkenkuckucksheim,Scanning,"People often ask about the difference in quality that scanning techniques make. There are some really good comparisons out there by people who know what they're talking about, but I thought I'd add my results in case anyone finds it helpful. 

This picture was taken on HP5 on an Olympus Trip 35. At first I got it developed and scanned at an okay but not brilliant highstreet lab (Rapidphoto in Brixton London). I liked the picture and have been thinking about putting it on the wall. So, after hearing good things about them, I sent it off to a drumscanner (ukdrumscanning, who were great) to see what difference it makes. I figured it would be a good comparison - it's a really detailed image, and the orginal processing wasn't at a specialist lab.

Anyway comparisons below. If people are interested in seeing full res shots let me know and I can host somewhere. The images are adjusted just to match my personal preference and to be as close as possible. The uncropped image is exported from LR at 120ppcm 40cm on the long edge at 100% quality with standard output sharpening for the screen. The crop is the same but 20cm (equivalent to if the image as a whole was 100cm along the long edge)

What do you think?

My personal take is that the difference is pretty slim when uncropped. You could notice it if it's blown up to 60cm or more I bet, but it's mostly just a little cleaner and seems to have a bit less digital noise.

When cropped you can both notice now much sharper the lines are (eg look at the lettering or the books), how much smoother the shadow gradients seem to be (this is more subjective) and also how the noisey edges are a much nicer grain and less digital.

Overall this is consistent with everything everyone has ever said about drumscanning: it is objectively and subjectively better, but to an enthusiastic amateur like me those differences are almost imperceptible until you're blowing it up big. For me that means I'll save drumscanning for any 35mm that I'm printing above 60cm.

If I do print it I'll report back.

Is there a difference between glasses lenses at high Street optition?,AskUK,1b7br48,2024-03-05 12:57:24,2,0.75,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1b7br48/is_there_a_difference_between_glasses_lenses_at/,FrittataHubris,,"Is there a big difference in glasses and lenses between highstreet optitions?

I had an eye test recently and now need glasses for distance. I decided not to buy glasses straightaway asi didn't want to rush the decision  and I'm quite indecisive. 

The independent ones seems too expensive for the moment for what they offer. So I've limited it to Vision Express, Specsavers and Boots. I dont want or need ultra luxurious expensive eyewear when a third of my wardrobe is primark. I just want to see clearly and jot have headaches.

After doing a fair bit of reading, it seems that different stores have different quality lenses available. Like Boots say on there sight that they can do Zeiss lens which are meant to be top tier. And Vision Express do Essilor which is also meant to be good, but apparently they are owned by Luxottica who have monopoly in eyewear. Specsavers I assume do there own brand or something else.

So if I was to base it just on lenses, is there a big difference between the 35¬£ specsavers upgraded lens and the top anti reflection/blue light Vision Express and zeiss lenses?

And also, I was told I should get blue light lens upgrade too as I'm working on the computer all day. Has it made much difference for those of you that use it?

And for frames, boots seems to hold the most variety in brands and price, but most of them are locked away and you have to ask them to unlock a column in order to try them, so it takes away the ease of trying to find something that suited me and isnt just a priced high because of name brand.

Vision express has a few brands, but they all seem kind of similar and couldn't find much difference between them all. I assume because they might all be Luxottica. But they have buy one get 2nd pair half price. Plus they have option to pay monthly.

Specsavers surprisingly had a bit more variety in the difference in style between the brands. And have buy one get one free, which is even cheaper overall. But they dont seem to do blue light filter lenses.

Then last option is there is an outlet nearby which has some bigger brands available but at a cheaper cost than what is available from boots. Not sure who does the lenses, but they free basic lense or 35¬£ upgraded lense and 50¬£ premium lense. I think they were both anti scratch or reflection, just ones higher quality. They have them in bulk do were able to do them cheaper and quicker. A few days rather than 2 weeks.

Basically I cant decide on which glasses and where to buy it from, and whether I should prioritise lens or just the frame that suits me. Please help. I didn't think it would be this hard to choose.
I'm not buying online as I would o

I‚Äôve been a mortgage advisor at a highstreet bank for about 3yrs now and beginning to look for a change. The only things I get offered are other mortgage advisor roles, either in a self-employed role or occasionally get messages about a broker role. This is more of an interest as quite like the security of an employed role but equally all the job adverts claim you get all this commission and just not sure what the earning potential is actually like.  I‚Äôm on a salary of just over ¬£33k, with reasonable benefits that you‚Äôd expect and decent pension contributions (they contribute 13%, I put in 7). I don‚Äôt want to lose those, and broker roles seem to have very basic packages, but with the commission to make up for it I guess. No real pressure / targets in my current role.

Everything just seems like a sideways step and I‚Äôd like to take steps to move upward and increase my earning abilities. Qualification wise I‚Äôve got CeMAP, CeRER. 

Are there any other qualifications I should consider? 
Is anyone else in that industry and has experience of similar roles and can offer some advise on next steps? I feel like I need a career coach! "

An ode to CD's...and a rant,Cd_collectors,1amqhw0,2024-02-09 10:20:07,98,0.95,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cd_collectors/comments/1amqhw0/an_ode_to_cdsand_a_rant/,ROCUK,Discussion,"Coming into my teenage years in the early 90's the CD was for me the format of choice and the logical progression from clumsy vinyl. 

Like many kids or even adults in that era the all in one HiFi Sytem was a big thing, having a cassette Deck, Tuner and Turntable all in one box, it wasn't until later years in the 90's that they started to come with built in cd players too and got smaller - remember the mini/micro-hifi fad?, so the first Cd player I had was a stand alone one from Sony, that I connected to my HiFi system. 

I marvelled at it, this thing from the future that played my shiny discs with perfect sound, not like the awful record player ontop of my hiFi system that sounded like someone shouting into a tin can, the CD gave me the perfect quality I had never dreamed of.

Cassette tapes were still a thing for me back then, I would record cd's i'd borrowed off friends onto tapes - to listen in my walkman on the way to & from school, I didn't seem to notice or mind the quality - or lack of - back then as they simply served a purpose, to be able to listen to my music on the move, come to think of it the earbuds I had back then would have sounded awful anyway regardless of the quality of output going into them. 

I think my first CD I got was Nevermind by Nirvana, followed by Wish by The Cure and the Black Album from Metallica, I was so proud of my little collection and how they neatly stood together next to my Cd seperate. It was an exciting time, we would save up to buy the latest album, going to HMV or OurPrice or Tower Records, Sister Ray in Berwick Street etc. I loved going to the Music exchange in Notting Hill to try and grab a bargain and take a punt on albums just by looking at the cover art.

I think why i'm writing this post is because as i'm sure plenty people are aware, there seems to be a romantic renaissance with Vinyl LPS, people buying them for the ""physical tangibale product"" and all those cliche's, trying to hold on to something from the past, which I do get, especially in this digital streaming cloud world we live in. For me the CD was my vinyl, as soon as the format came along it was smaller, better sounding (regardelss of what audiophiles say, you can make any cd sound ""warm"" just by using EQ's), it wouldn't degrade after playback, didn't suffer from surface noise or warp if left in the sun.

The price of Vinyl is ludicrous, walking into HMV or any main highstreet music retailer there are now rows & rows of vinyl records for sale, all brand new & shrink wrapped - even the classics, which makes me wonder, are they all manufactured from the same factory - probably using digital master files? - essentially the CD version pressed onto wax to cash in on the trend?, I highly doubt all these new shrinkwrapped albums, classic ones and new releases are mastered in the same way that records were back when it was the main format?, so why would you pay ¬£30/¬£40/¬£50+ for an album with inferior digital sound masked as analogue quality, when you can buy the same original album on ebay on CD for mere pounds?! and get a better quality product at the same time.

I'm glad I have stated to appreciate my cd collection again, I'm slowly rebuilding it only with key favourite albums that i've only had digitally over the past 15/20 years (the iPod has a lot to answer for). I can't do the same with vinyl, purely because I can't afford it, but also because at the end of the day it's the music that matters and you can't get much better than the music you get on a CD!

What's the point of having a flagship Location in Oxford Circus if you stock the exact same inventory as every other store in the UK? I went to Levis who typically stock long length trousers and they told me to shop online?! I recently ordered 5 different pairs of long length chinos from M&S and they were all too short. I'm sure this question has been asked before but where am I expected to find high quality trousers that actually fit comfortably? Ralph Loren sell a 'long' range but I have only found some Length 34 Long trousers, which will not be long enough for me. 

The only luck I had has is on ASOS. They do their own range and they have a Huge range but they sell out extremely fast and they don't last particularly long.

Half of the restaurants are owned by the same person / people and they either close down after 18 months, reopen with a different name or move to a different spot in the high street.

There are super cars parked outside Costa Coffee frequently with men sat outside having serious looking conversations in expensive looking clothes.

My bet is that the restaurants are a front for cleaning money. It almost feels like they‚Äôre playing monopoly with the restaurants on locksbottom highstreet.

"[Southwestern Ontario - 21st - Post 3] Frost_Walker2017 awakens from his reverie to discover he‚Äôs giving a speech on business and economics, among other things, conveniently timed after his opponent spoke about these things",OntarioSimCampaigning,18o22go,2023-12-21 19:39:16,2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioSimCampaigning/comments/18o22go/southwestern_ontario_21st_post_3_frost_walker2017/,Frost_Walker2017,,"‚Äú...cameras rolling, in 3‚Ä¶ 2‚Ä¶ 1‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was in that moment that Frosty realised he‚Äôd been daydreaming again. Silently cursing himself for losing track of time, he glanced around. *A‚Ä¶ TV studio‚Ä¶? Gods, what have I gotten myself into now?* Some of the crew were looking expectedly at him, and his aides were sharing confused glances with one another. *Shit. Time to act.*

‚ÄúHello!‚Äù He said, as confidently as he could muster, well aware that he had no idea what he was meant to be doing at this moment in time. ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù He repeated, thinking quickly. ‚ÄúMy name, as you may know, is Frosty, and I‚Äôm the Alliance candidate for Southwestern Ontario.‚Äù Out of the corner of his eye he saw his aides look relieved. *Good. I‚Äôm on track.* ‚ÄúYou may know me as the man who developed his own manifesto and policies for Southwestern Ontario, to augment the provincial party platform. Well, today I‚Äôm here to elaborate some more. Today, I want to talk about businesses.‚Äù

Another confused glance. *Shit. Well, can‚Äôt stop now! That was thought with flagrant disregard to the fact that he could, in fact, stop any time he wanted, but he continued to power through and hoped he could cover up his improvisation.

‚ÄúParties left of centre are often ridiculed for lacking economic policies,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a common misconception that only right of centre parties are sensible enough to talk economics. Well, I‚Äôm here to dispel that myth. I firmly believe that a social democratic model is essential to safeguard our future as humans, that we can set the stage now for long lasting change to materially improve the lives of all our citizens, now and forever. Which is why, in the Legislature, I will push wholeheartedly against short term thinking that risks looking nowhere beyond the next election and focusing inwards.‚Äù

He needed to come up with something, and quickly. He racked his brains for something, anything, that could be useful now that he‚Äôd spoken. 

‚ÄúFor instance,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúMany are concerned about the state of the high street, thinking that nobody cares about the butcher going out of business, or the family-run clothing shop becoming a charity shop instead, and that this is a situation that cannot be reversed. That this is one way only, and that we are watching the death of the high street.

‚ÄúI say this to those people - it can be reversed. We can bring back the high street, in one form or another, and rejuvenate villages, towns, and cities across not only here in Southwestern Ontario, but across the province as a whole. My plan takes two separate forms.

‚ÄúThe first is that we accept that online shopping, or shopping at bigger supermarkets, is simply more convenient for the vast majority of people under our current economic model, and that they need not sacrifice this convenience for the sake of smaller businesses. With this, my view is that high streets can take a different appearance. They may not be thriving centrepieces, full of small and family owned businesses that people feel involved in, but they can remain centrepieces. We can rebuild our high streets as community hubs, through the conversion of businesses into social spaces - such as nightclubs, or community centres - or establishments with a social characteristic - such as cafes, or pubs, or bars, or even libraries. While we won‚Äôt see as many smaller businesses in the traditional form, there‚Äôs no reason that these cafes or pubs or community centres cannot be run by smaller businesses, or run by families. By developing high streets into these community hubs, we can rekindle the spirit of the old high street in an era gone by and bring people together to enjoy life with one another.

‚ÄúThis will not be done merely through hope. I am prepared to engage with all levels of government necessary to deliver the investment into our towns and high streets that we deserve, and this forms a necessary part of it. In government I would explore establishing a fund dedicated to transitioning high streets into community hubs, and in opposition I will push for the government to establish something like this.

‚ÄúThe second form is that we fight back against the death of the high street as we know it. While I wouldn‚Äôt want to establish a smaller tax rate for smaller businesses, as this will inhibit growth and make owners reluctant to expand when they see more money will disappear as they do owing to a higher marginal tax rate, we have other methods available to us. One such method would be creating a fund for smaller businesses to apply to for fixed, low interest loans or straight grants for immediate cash injections, or we could explore a system of subsidies to help them lower prices and stand up to bigger businesses.

‚ÄúIn truth, the best option lies somewhere in the middle.‚Äù 

He knew he was waffling a bit, but he had a goal in mind, and he was doing his best to ignore the looks he was getting. Frosty was in his element, and he was on a roll. 

‚ÄúI would want a combination of both these scenarios. Subsidising smaller businesses, as in the second form, would not deal with the issue of convenience that larger supermarkets or digital shopping has. Yet, moving away from the traditional model and towards the community hubs is also not, on its own, the best move. You would likely see duplicated businesses all vying for the same market share, with little to differentiate them, all in the same area. In the long run, you would see a similar outcome to currently, with shops lying unused, and a soulless high street focused around a few buildings.

‚ÄúSo we need to do both of those things in tandem, really. We need to develop new community hubs, and we need to support smaller businesses to help them stand up to larger corporations. By giving people a reason to visit the high street, with the community hubs, we can entice them into a more immediately convenient shopping network on the highstreet. The outcome is a rejuvenated town centre, once more full of people.

‚ÄúAs part of this, of course, we do have to review existing legislation. Whether that‚Äôs opening and closing times, volume limits for nightclubs, or land use changes, we have to ensure we can be as fluid as possible with how we use our high streets for maximum effect. There‚Äôs no point in advocating for change, with new funds in place, if we don‚Äôt rectify the base issues that will impede the growth of our plans.

‚ÄúAnd, speaking of growth-‚Äù 

Something else had occurred to Frosty, and now he had to pivot. Fortunately for him, he was very good at pivoting, and he did so literally as he started pacing to keep his brain ticking at maximum capacity. 

‚ÄúI firmly believe that we can make use of our position, here in Southwestern Ontario. We border Detroit, just over the river, and touch the Great Lakes. With Ontario at large, we border some of Canada‚Äôs biggest internal economies with Quebec City and Montreal, and of course we have Ottawa and Toronto within our own borders. So, why not make use of that position?

‚ÄúWith the US, we can improve our international transport links. I‚Äôm more than prepared to develop closer ties with our southern neighbours through more river crossings, more ferry crossings, and even explore expansion of Canada-US train lines. Of course, this stuff is all reserved to the Federal Parliament, but I am more than capable of lobbying both levels of government to push on this, in service of my constituents and the people of Ontario at large.

‚ÄúInternal to Ontario, I would back the expansion of High Speed rail along our core, and up to the northern ends of our province, up to Sudbury, Thunder Bay, to Fort Hope, and beyond. With greater transport links at such speed, suddenly the gap between north and south, and east and west, need not seem so big. Suddenly, everybody can share in the prosperity of others, and visit larger cities with more businesses to improve their economies, or visit smaller towns and villages with more picturesque scenery and help their tourism industries. Alongside this, we must ensure that local transport infrastructure can support an increase in traffic, and I would want to conduct a thorough review to determine where improvements can be made.

‚ÄúBy boosting our infrastructure links with our neighbours, and internally, we bring new economic benefits to all of us and break down barriers that risk holding us back. Because at the core of it, that‚Äôs what social democracy is all about - that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm all about. We must break down the barriers that divide us for a more equitable and equal society, where all can flourish and grow to be the best they can be. I‚Äôve spoken at length before about how this would apply to LGBT individuals, or homeless individuals, and in my mini-manifesto demonstrated two key education policies - in the Qualification Attainment Scheme and the Skills Grant - that would help break down these barriers.‚Äù

Frosty takes a deep breath in, aware that he‚Äôs spoken at length and that he should really wrap things up now. 

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI believe that I‚Äôve shown how we can boost our economy, both here and elsewhere, using thoroughly left of centre ideals. No more will the economy be the sole domain of the right of centre - I‚Äôm capable of taking the fight to other parties to scrutinise their work, and I hope to be able to do that in the next legislature. To do that, I need your support. A vote for me is a vote for forward thinking social democratic ideas that work to build our communities from the ground up. Together, we can rise.‚Äù

Frosty lapsed into silence, holding a pose, as he hoped people would realised he had finished his speech. He was there for a few minutes longer before somebody called ‚ÄúCut!‚Äù and he breathed a sigh of relief. It was over, and he had held his own.

‚ÄúThat was very good, Frosty,‚Äù one aide said, walking up to him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got plenty we can use there. There‚Ä¶ is one problem, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is?‚Äù He‚Äôd been afraid of that.

‚ÄúIt was meant to be a speech on the environment,‚Äù the aide explained.

Frosty froze for a moment before sighing. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ well, I think it went well, anyway!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt did! Just‚Ä¶ could you do it again, but staying on topic this time?‚Äù

Frosty sighed again. He was very good at that. ‚ÄúI guess, yeah. Give me five minutes and I‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù

Frosty returned to his dressing room to re-read his notes on environment policy. ‚ÄúSupporting the carbon tax‚Ä¶ good‚Ä¶ wildfire prevention force, good‚Ä¶ golf courses turned into housing? ‚Ä¶ well, I don‚Äôt have to say everything, I suppose.‚Äù

Five minutes exactly later, Frosty returned to the set and prepared to speak again, putting on his best smile as he went over his rehearsed lines.

‚Äú...cameras rolling, in 3‚Ä¶ 2‚Ä¶ 1‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHi there!‚Äù Frosty began, the smile still fixed onto his face. ‚ÄúMy name is Frosty, and you may know me as the Alliance candidate for Southwestern Ontario. Today, I‚Äôd like to speak to you about our plans for the environment.‚Äù

Internally, Frosty was cursing himself for agreeing to all this. In his dressing room, he‚Äôd spotted that he had five more of these to do, all for different topics. Resigned to his fate, he continued reading his rehearsed lines, talking about how Alliance would create a dedicated wildfire prevention taskforce to combat wildfires and manage them if they should break out, and how they would create a ministry for environmental disasters more broadly. He also sprinkled in a few of his own policies, like how he would back a scheme for planting a tree for every child born in Ontario as a sort of symbolism for life, or how he would push for tougher restrictions against polluting and harsher punishments for those destroying natural lands. 

‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù he added, as he prepared to round off the speech. ‚ÄúHere in Ontario, we have such beauty in the form of the Great Lakes. It would be a shame if it all fell apart. To that end, I‚Äôd support expanding the national marine conservation areas to include as much of it as possible, and even explore the potential for expanding people‚Äôs access to these areas, largely through more funding for more boat rides so that people can truly appreciate its beauty up close.‚Äù

*It‚Äôs a strange situation*, he thought. *Two down, five more to go, and I don‚Äôt remember a bit of agreeing to this.* He just hoped it would all work out on election day."
Looking for wide fit affordable boots (UK) - help appreciated!,Boots,18lfrph,2023-12-18 13:30:29,2,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boots/comments/18lfrph/looking_for_wide_fit_affordable_boots_uk_help/,Limbolants,Question/Help‚ùì‚ùì,"Hi, please let me know if this kind of post doesn't belong here/ if there's a more suitable reddit to post it to.

I've been looking for some boots that will fit and, after spending literal months looking, I thought I'd ask for some opinions.

These are the only shoes I can find that fit right now, but they last 2 months tops before splitting, my second pair's just broken and I need to find something more durable. ([https://www.shoezone.com/Products/Urban-Territory-Bill-Mens-Brown-Lace-Up-Boot-586015](https://www.shoezone.com/Products/Urban-Territory-Bill-Mens-Brown-Lace-Up-Boot-586015))

Needs to be:

* Boot
* Capable of handling light-moderate hiking (eg. water resistant and won't get pierced by the first stick it encounters)
* Reasonably flexible (most of mine split at the ball of the foot and I find inflexible soles really uncomfortable)
* Reasonably flat on the inside - no really high arch support or anything
* Wide, square toe box. I have very wide feet
* Plus points if they look smart-ish or at least are vaguely leathery. I'm shooting for an all-rounder.
* **Shipped to the UK**
* Budget of ¬£150 max. I'm hoping they'll last maybe 2 years?
* Smaller sizes are a plus - I'm a UK womens 6, with mens it varies if they go down that low.

I really like the look of the zero-drop ""barefoot"" boots like Lems, but I've heard some less than great things about the build quality and can't seem to get the more rugged ones for anything under ¬£200 in the UK. Already tried wide-fit Clarks which turned out to be a lot of pain and a wasted ¬£150, and haven't been able to find anything on the highstreet. I used to just size up until shoes fit, but that meant I was literally balancing in my shoes and I fell on my face more than once.

Thank you!

(3) Local authorities may submit means-tested proposals for projects, which may include, but are not limited to:

    b) Create attractive public spaces, seating areas, and green spaces, particularly in areas with limited recreational options.

(3) This Act extends to England only.

**This Bill was submitted by u/Leftywalrus MP CBE 1st Baron Wetwang on behalf of His Majesty‚Äôs Most Loyal Opposition.**


**Opening Speech**

Deputy Speaker,
As we all know, high streets across England are facing a number of challenges. The rise of online shopping has led to a decline in foot traffic, and many high streets have become increasingly run down and unattractive. This has had a negative impact on local businesses, and it has also made high streets less appealing to residents and visitors.
I believe that this bill is essential to the future of high streets in England. By implementing these measures, we can make high streets more vibrant, attractive, and sustainable places to live, work, and visit.

How To Add Visual Interest To Summer Outfits,femalefashionadvice,15wdfb3,2023-08-20 10:51:18,480,0.98,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15wdfb3/how_to_add_visual_interest_to_summer_outfits/,squeegee-beckenheim,,"One question that pops up incredibly often on this sub once high temperatures hit is how to make warm weather wear looks‚Ä¶interesting. The disconnect seems to occur because for fall/winter dressing, there is more texture and more layering to play with, so it‚Äôs easier to create an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù rather than just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù. When you‚Äôre only wearing one layer, that becomes more difficult and the outfit you‚Äôre trying to put together can leave something to be desired, as it‚Äôs plain and stripped back. 


But you don‚Äôt have to layer 3 types of clothes in order to maintain style going into the warmer months. Warm weather has endless opportunities for fashionable dressing, and in the glorious absence of a big coat that covers up all your hard work, you‚Äôre free to show off an outfit that plays with colors, proportions, textures, patterns, or interesting accessories. 


I know summer is technically on its way out, but a lot of us still have at least a month or two of hot weather to go, so let‚Äôs take a look at putting together some cool summer outfits. 





# Color





Perhaps more than anything else, warm weather is an excellent opportunity to enjoy color. While no one‚Äôs stopping you from wearing colorful clothes in the winter, it‚Äôs clear that cold weather tends to be a sad mass of black - mostly for practical reasons. 


But when the sun is shining and there are no coats covering up your outfit, you can bring out the yellows, the pinks, the greens - and they can be the key to taking your attire from just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù to an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 







## color blocking




Color blocking is a tried and true method to add visual interest. Color in an outfit always brings it up a step, but color blocking requires more skill, and more attention paid to silhouette, as well as color pairings. You can opt for colors opposite on the color wheel, or just colors that feel right to you - there are no rules, as long as you love the result. 





[color blocking 1](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QFQSRI1k8D8/YMCzhFYUYmI/AAAAAAAALF0/2gTtzRYlFYYcv3YisM-UKRzFvgWGKBsGwCLcBGAsYHQ/s894/IMG_20210609_121521_902.jpg)

[color blocking 5](https://www.economyofstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fun-Summer-Color-Combinations-To-Wear-3c.jpg)







##pop of color




Opting for just a pop of color can be a great way to make your outfit more fun, but without the difficulty of pairing colors together. The easiest way to do it is to add a colorful bag to an otherwise neutral outfit. A lavender bag can give a little contrast to a basic white dress and elevate it to an outfit. Especially if you‚Äôre also pairing it with a colorful pair of shoes. Matching shoes are fine, but an even more interesting choice is a pair of shoes in a complementary color.

## monochrome



Probably a lot of us have worn all-black before, but how many have tried the same in a different color? What is boring and safe in black becomes infinitely more stylish and interesting in a bold color that goes great with a tan. Think about an all pink outfit and what a statement it makes. It‚Äôs still really easy to put together - you‚Äôre only using one color - and yet, it‚Äôs anything but boring.

[monochrome 3](https://withwonderandwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Anthropologie-Somerset-Dress-Eyelet-Edition-in-Pink-4.jpg)





##tonal dressing



Pairing colors together can be tricky and it‚Äôs often a barrier of entry to fashion for the regular person. But there are easy, somewhat prescriptive ways to do it, like tonal dressing. Not quite monochrome, tonal dressing is more about picking different shades of the same base color or color palette. Adjacent colors, if you will. Both a step above monochrome, and easier than finding identical shades to match, tonal dressing is more visually exciting than a monochromatic outfit, while still being a subtle way to do color.

# Pattern




Perhaps an obvious suggestion, pattern pulls an outfit right out of its boring, solid color nothingness and gives it purpose, it gives it oomph, it gives it visual interest. Where things really get interesting is when you pattern match - or clash. But that‚Äôs a somewhat ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù lesson. For now, even something as simple as choosing a floral skirt instead of a solid colored one can make your clothes an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 




## floral




Yes, yes, florals for spring are not groundbreaking. But we have to walk before we can run. Florals are common, and they‚Äôre easy. A very seasonally-appropriate pattern for spring-summer, it adds a touch of whimsy and femininity to an otherwise simple outfit.

## polka dots & stripes




Polka dots and stripes are other classic patterns you can‚Äôt really go wrong with. They typically still come in neutral colors, for the most part, but you can also find them in more fun colors if you don‚Äôt want to stick to boring black and white.

## abstract




Then, of course, we‚Äôve got the cooler, more modern abstract prints. Paint splotches, random shapes, approximations of faces - anything goes. Why wear a basic white shirt, when you can wear an interesting one?

## gingham




Gingham is a classic summer staple. Casual and light, it‚Äôs a quintessential ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù print. Black and white gingham is a good neutral option, but if you want something more fun, any pastel color + white is very summery while still maintaining visual interest.

## pattern clashing




Of course, the ultimate way to wear pattern is to clash it against more pattern. A higher difficulty task, but with a big visual reward, pattern clashing can make even the most boring, basic outfit look elevated.

# Texture






When you‚Äôve not got many pieces to work with for an outfit, those pieces have to work much harder to be interesting, to stand out, to be ‚Äúworthy‚Äù. In comes texture. An outfit that‚Äôs cotton from top to bottom is not much of an outfit. It‚Äôs plain, flat, and boring. Mixing silk and organza, however, becomes an event. 






## linen/cotton
Linen and cotton are the fabrics of choice for many during the summer. It‚Äôs easy to see why - they keep you cool, they feel nice, and they‚Äôre easy to find on the highstreet at decent prices. Plus, they tend to last - if slightly discolored from the sun. A good basis that you can add to.

## sheer (tulle, gauze, organza)




Sheer is having a huge moment, and now is the time to take full advantage. Despite it being mainly synthetic fabrics, the thinness, sheerness, volume and lightweight quality of these fabrics means they can be easily worn during the height of summer without fear of heatstroke. Beautiful, diaphanous, and eminently *special*, a sheer element can bring the whimsy you need for a wedding outfit, the femininity to a date outfit, or that special je n‚Äôest ce quoi to a simple brunch outfit.

## silk




Silk is in no way as fanciful as it‚Äôs touted to be, and it has the excellent advantage of being a great light-weight option for hot weather. Especially if you need something special or formal, there‚Äôs nothing better than silk. It looks amazing, it‚Äôs cool, and it packs small.

## seersucker



A quintessential summer fabric if there ever was one, seersucker is great for a variety of clothes. Since it‚Äôs so light, it allows you to wear more formal or covered up garments, such as an elegant seersucker suit that would be hot in any other fabric. 




[seersucker 1](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppkMIfMKA8A/WRu6WZr0T7I/AAAAAAAAXmc/fwbxEejfy1ciW1iw4xBaVr7Xg4lab4XNACEw/s1600/eloquii%2Bseersuker%2Bdress%2B%2Bboater%2Bhat%2Bplus%2Bsize%2Boutfit.jpg)

##muslin




With a slightly ‚Äúcrinkled‚Äù texture, muslin is casual in nature, and it brings visual interest all on its own. Sure, it may not be ideal for a sleek outfit, but it‚Äôs perfect for a billowy sleeveless dress when it‚Äôs too hot to put anything else on, but you still want it to look ~interesting~.

# Proportions & silhouette 





My personal favorite, playing with proportion and silhouette is a subtle and sophisticated way to create An Outfit if you‚Äôre not into accessorizing or it‚Äôs too hot to pile on the necklaces. Structural and sleek, this type of outfit allows shapes to speak for themselves and become the main event, with minimal other distractions. 





## loose on loose



There is no better season to do loose on loose than summer, especially if you prefer not to show skin. As cute as tight dresses are, this is not the time to pull them out. Instead, a pair of cropped wide leg pants can work surprisingly well with a boxy shirt with billowy sleeves. The silhouette is interesting on its own, you don‚Äôt have fabric touching your skin, and you‚Äôre not getting sunburned. All in all, 10/10 summer outfit.

## tight on loose




That isn‚Äôt to say that we can‚Äôt do tight + loose in hot weather, you just have to be more strategic about it. It‚Äôs still a visually interesting silhouette, but in the summer, the tight element should be the top, paired with a looser skirt or pair of pants. A bodycon tanktop or crop top with a pair of high-waisted linen shorts is as elegant as it is cooling.

## structural/architectural detailing 





Sometimes, a single piece with strong architectural detailing can bring all the pizzazz you need. In recent years, with the ushering in of maximalist tendencies, there‚Äôs been no shortage of interesting structural details on summer clothes. A short, but wonderfully voluminous dress is both a statement and a clever way to stay cool. Same with very wide pants, a long column silhouette, intense pleating on a skirt, or an interesting neckline. Unexpected accessories like very chunky shoes paired with a very short dress or a very small purse with a voluminous outfit can also provide that extra kick.

# Interesting details




Seemingly small details can go a long way in elevating a piece, so don‚Äôt discount the power that beading can have, straps, buckles, or even buttons. Some of these details will work better for evening than daytime, but it entire depends on your style, the type of embellishment, and the occasion. Daytime sequins are acceptable outside of Vegas now, I‚Äôm just saying. 






## embellishment




Simple shapes can still look amazing, if you add a little bling. The addition of sequins, rhinestones, or intricate beading can turn a forgettable dress into something special. The best part is that this can be DIY-ed, especially if you have a dress you‚Äôre a little tired of or that is a tad boring. You can be as restrained or as crazy as you want with your embellishments. Pearl straps, bejeweled necklines, or full sequinned pieces - they‚Äôre always a show-stopper.

## straps



With enough sunscreen, or a disregard for unconventional tan lines, something as simple as strap placement can make an outfit more interesting. Very strappy tops are very in right now, as are tops and dresses with open backs with special detailing, like tie-backs, bows, or cut-outs in different shapes.

## buckles, knots, pleating, buttons





Other distinct visual details that can also be utilitarian also help draw the eye, add some contrast, and zuzh up your outfit. Whether it‚Äôs a simple row of contrasting buttons, some statement hardware in the form of a special belt buckle, or gorgeous pleating, these details can say a lot without trying too hard.

# Accessories


Sometimes, the easiest way to do it is just to add accessories. It requires less fussing, and you don‚Äôt have to think as much about them. The biggest bonus here is that accessories rarely make you hotter, but they can still have a huge visual impact and totally ‚Äúmake‚Äù an outfit. 



## textured/colorful/big or small bag




A bag should never be an afterthought, but that‚Äôs especially important to remember when putting together summer outfits. Because you have fewer elements to play with, each of them becomes more important and ‚Äúweighs‚Äù more in the overall structure of your look. 


A very big or very small bag is a tried and true way to bring the unexpected, but you can also achieve a similar effect if you pick a bag that is colorful, or that‚Äôs textured. Consider giving your black leather bags a rest, and instead, enjoying wicker baskets, wooden bags, braided bags, and other unique textures or shapes. Summer is the time for the novelty bag to shine.

## interesting shoes - size, color, heel shape, embellishments




Of course, shoes are also essential. Not just because you literally cannot create an outfit without them, but because they can also weigh heavily in the balance of your outfit. Luckily for us, statement shoes are in, and there‚Äôs plenty to play with in terms of features. Chunky shoes are du jour, but there are also very strappy shoes out there, interesting heel shapes, high platforms, shiny embellishments, and shockingly neon colors.

## hats 



If you‚Äôve ever wished you could wear hats, but were afraid you‚Äôd look like an asshole, now is your time. You have plausible deniability, hats are not just stylish, but they‚Äôre useful, or even necessary, if you live somewhere where the sun is particularly oppressive. Shout out to Australia, the skin cancer capital of the world. 


A straw hat can complete an outfit or push it towards a certain vibe. Chic Gondolier with a breton tee and black shorts? Add a hat. Jungle Adventurer dressed head to toe in new-wave Banana Republic? Add a hat. Baptist Church Lady-core with a ruffly floral dress? Add a hat.

# Third Piece



The third piece is, of course, a basic ‚Äúrule‚Äù for outfit creation, but hot weather makes it just a little bit more difficult, when even one layer of clothing feels like too much to bear. Thankfully, you can ‚Äúcheat‚Äù and still add your third piece, but without adding extra bulk on top of an outfit you‚Äôre already overheating in. 






## linen blazer




For evenings and A/C environments, a linen blazer is very versatile and makes almost any outfit better. It works great with little dresses, shorts, wide leg linen pants - it flatters elegant outfits and beautifully contrasts more casual ones. You really can‚Äôt go wrong, and you also can‚Äôt overheat.

## vests




A more summer-y version of the blazer, the vest is not just very fashionable at the moment, it‚Äôs also the perfect layering piece. Adding minimal bulk, but maximum visual interest, a vest can be paired with anything, from dresses to shirts & shorts, to wearing it by itself as a top. The vest + shorts or vest + pleated pants combo reigns supreme for the spring/summer season; it‚Äôs sophisticated, a little masculine, and a nice departure from typical summer outfits.

## fanny pack/cross body



Any bag can make a good third piece, as we‚Äôve discussed, but a fanny pack worn crossbody is more visible, in many ways, it‚Äôs very cool, and it can be very flattering. Worn on top of a straighter, looser, or more billowy top or dress, it creates some necessary shaping, while still maintaining the casual vibe. Wear it in a contrasting color or interesting texture for maximum effect.

## maximalist jewelry



Jewelry may be the easy way out, but one cannot deny the effect of a truly big-ass pair of earrings with an otherwise simple outfit. Necklaces, rings, and bracelets are not to be ignored, and can also work beautifully to accent an outfit or your great tan, but earrings have the advantage of not touching your skin and they also bring attention to your face, and look great with your hair up - a must, in hot weather.

# What's the bottom line?


Summer dressing can be just as fun as dressing for cooler weather, just in a different way. Layering is not the only way to create something that feels like An Outfit, and sophistication and visual interest are completely achievable in hot weather, even while remaining cool. The examples shown here aren‚Äôt meant to be a rulebook to follow, but serve more as inspiration for your own wardrobe and can hopefully give you some ideas on ways to fall in love with your summer wardrobe.

My girlfriend is considering a career in transport - Class 1 or 2? Any feedback for a woman getting into the industry?,uktrucking,14yea0w,2023-07-13 03:47:47,7,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktrucking/comments/14yea0w/my_girlfriend_is_considering_a_career_in/,toHGVornottoHGV,,"Hey uktrucking!

My partner and I are moving to Nottingham next week and she is planning to have a bit of a career change. When we get there, initially she will apply for anything she can get to help pay the bills, probably retail as we are hoping there's good opportunity to do extra hours. I'll be keepnig my current job but looking for something on the side, ideally we want to work 45-50 hours a week for the next year or so, to help pay the bills and then bring in the extra to put towards a wedding, future childcare costs etc. 

She has always worked on a farm in a very physical job and she's a great driver, I've never seen somebody reverse quite like her! 

She was considering becoming an HGV driver as the drivers on her farm always speak very highly of it, but I appreciate they are more delivering to big, open farms rather than through a highstreets.

Although we don't mind working more than 40 hours for the time being, she won't want to stay in the cab overnight (tramping?). We've watched some YouTube videos like 'day in the life of a class 1 driver' and read through posts on here and we know she can do it and likely well, but I was hoping if you all had any advice for her getting into the industry?

&#x200B;

She will likely complete the course whilst on annual leave and maintain her normal job until she secures one in the industry and will likely ask her employer if they will have anything available for her, assuming she get's into retail.

&#x200B;

We'd really appreciate ANY advice or guidance you have to offer, but I did have a few specific questions:

&#x200B;

\-Any advice for a mid-twenty female getting into the industry? 

\-Do companies offer maternity pay

\-Class 1 or Class 2? From what I can see, it looks like Class 2 would have better hours, albeit less pay, but it from what I can see it would still be a 5-10k pay rise to working in retail for similar hours. 

\-I've seen that she may have to do some agency work and get experience under her belt, do you think there's any discrimination for women in the industry, as only 1% of drivers are women? Do you think it might actually help improve her odds of getting a job?

\-As a class 1 driver, would you do class 2? Or vise versa, as a class 2, would you do class 1?

\-Living in Nottingham, would it be likely a class 1 job would involve going through the city centre to small shops, or is it more likely on the motorway to depots? 

Thanks again! :)

Then I would like to use this bank statement as a proof of address for other things such as registering for GP and my national insurance number and then opening my bank account for my LLC.

I have read some banks may send a post to the registered address and I can use a 'code; in that to prove I live there. However all the info online is old (pre covid) and may be outdated. 

Any help on the same would be highly appreciated.

A conceptualisation of the Pret A Manger subscription as a dangerous communicable disease,london,14t97e4,2023-07-07 10:41:31,672,0.91,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/14t97e4/a_conceptualisation_of_the_pret_a_manger/,FairlyEmily,," As I come to reflect on my time as an MSc student at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine the usual things spring to mind; good friendships, long nights in the library and of course, the Pret coffee subscription (PCS). My hometown of Norwich is known for having a church for every Sunday and a pub for every day of the year (Source: My Dad). London however is said to have a chain coffee shop for every self-proclaimed socialist studying at my university (tongue-in-cheek‚Ä¶. I think).

The PCS is a perfect storm of Gen Z fodder: subscription-based pricing, sugary drinks, and a location right opposite Russell Square underground station. It took mere weeks for what had been a smattering of pret cups in the lecture hall, to a veritable tsunami of latecomers to lectures, embarrassed but triumphantly carrying a pret cup in their hand. I hate to admit it, but I am but a mere mortal myself, and also fell to the allure of a ¬£12.50 month of coffee. I characterise myself and my classmates as keen entrepreneurs. Frequently we would try and get as many coffees as possible to ‚Äòstick it to the man‚Äô by milking our subscriptions, I fear this was not the most effective strategy(1).

[    Figure 1: Time with a pret subscription starting in September 2022 ending July 2023. N=10  self-report from an opportunity sample of 12 in the ‚Äò50 shades of tray‚Äô group chat. Two of those with 10 months are now cancelling their membership incidentally. And some are using a strategy outlined in footnote \(1\).](https://preview.redd.it/4ivn1w9i1kab1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=684cd9867066f6f9c4136f48547848dfee816241)

*(1):* While writing this I was reminded by some true comrades of a system called ‚Äòpret chat‚Äô in which people would post a coffee emoji each time they bought a drink. This was with the intention of making sure to space out drink orders by at least 30 minutes and facilitate multiple people sharing an account harmoniously. I am not going to name who was partaking in this account sharing but if you work for pret this is just a joke and not real.

**The death of the Highstreet** 

The smell of untaxed coffee sales as you gander down Oxford Street is perhaps the most appropriate way to characterise the stench of the rigor mortis of the British Highstreet. There are 237 prets in London- even going to church every week in Norwich couldn‚Äôt cancel out this morbid fact.

The pret sub is used 1.25 million times a week. Figure one shows that when in the correct environment long-pret can exist for months after initial contraction. Highly virulent. I should mention here that there are variants of this disease, perhaps the original strain was Pret but there are also 174 Starbucks and a whole bunch of costas, caf√© neros etc‚Ä¶ is hedge fund backed [Blank Street Coffee](https://ny.eater.com/2022/8/31/23329132/blank-street-coffee-chain-taking-over-new-york) the new omicron variant? 

Despite my mother saying the Pret Tuna Baguette (capitalised due to its godlike nature) is a national treasure I would argue that pret adds little to the collective value of the nation. The tension of this debate hangs heavy like the height of the cold war in my household. I think the thing I dislike most about this homogeneity is the sterility of it all. Perhaps apt in a newly germophobic society‚Ä¶

This prescription of Pret is at the expense of some rather lovely independent coffee shops. One that comes to mind is that of Store Street Coffee, less than 100m from the university, it does not benefit from significant student trade. My colleagues argue that the PCS is better value however I would argue that the subscription directly incentivises overuse and overconsumption of distinctly ‚Äòmid‚Äô coffees. Also, everyone having the PCS leads to a bit of Incredibles syndrome; ‚Äòwhen everyone is super, no one is‚Ä¶.‚Äô. 

**Conclusion: high quality evidence that the PCS is awful for Highstreet health.**

**RIP bank account and potentially my stomach** 

I am the first to argue with my dad that drinking the occasional coffee is in fact not the reason I can‚Äôt afford a house and that the PCS may actually be a good business decision, (see entrepreneurship point above). However, as ambition was to Macbeth, my largest weakness is probably saying stuff that has absolutely no empirical backing of any kind for the sake of it. I also queried in one of my lectures if the PCS could, potentially, be the cure for food poverty and world hunger. My lecturer did not enjoy this comment and I have to admit as always I had not done the maths to quantify this statement.  However, now I have:

  Some vaguely dietitian-y stuff about living off a pret sub to save money.

H0: The PCS could not sustain me for the rest of my life more cheaply than any other mainstream dietary pattern

\- ¬£15 a month(2) = 5x 260kcal, 34.3g sugars. (Ruby Chocolate Pret Shakers are the most calorific)

\- 1300kcal and 172g refined sugars. (note recommendation is <30g). Also 51g protein, pretty great.

\- This would probably be adequate for a sedentary 50kg woman. I am not a sedentary 50kg woman. Hence, the null hypothesis is proven, the pret subscription would not sustain me for the rest of my life however, I do think I could probably live for a year on this diet losing a significant proportion of my weight which although is not ideal, is perfectly sensible considering the cost of living

\- Note: milkshakes, frappes, and smoothies are CANCELLED probably in a cost cutting measure that has had an unintended positive public health impact.

(2) (this is the first month rate for a pret subscription, however, by creating new emails, this can be maintained indefinitely)

I did ask my group chat about favourite drinks and the drinks mentioned were: *rice-coconut decaf latte, I don‚Äôt subscribe to bad coffee (sic), soy caramel latte, dirty chai, chai latte, double shot oat milk cappuccino, soya flat white, iced latte, iced blended drink I cant remember what it‚Äôs called (sic), vanilla ice latter, flat white and mocha*. I physically cannot make a pie chart for that right now; my brain is melting on the train and it wouldn‚Äôt really show anything I think. My crappy qualitative analysis however is that they are some pretty unhealthy drinks and that a lot of my friends are lactose intolerant.

**Conclusions:** 

\- **high quality evidence that my friends have good taste in pret drinks**

\- **high quality evidence that the pret subscription could cure world hunger, but not the triple burden of malnutrition**

**The death of‚Ä¶ LSHTM students?**

One of the modules I took this year was alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, the students frequently rioted about the title of this module as sex, drugs and rock and roll sounded a lot cooler. Now, I am older and wiser and realise Pret subscriptions, vapes and Instagram reels is a much more apt and timely title.

The British Medical Association claimed that Pret baristas could earn more than junior doctors, ~~although this turned out to be an exaggeration~~. Perhaps this is a good option for public health graduates as the pay is far superior to anything we will be able to do when we graduate?

~~I think the answer to this all is that we really need elon musk and jeff bezos to team up to open a tesla branded coffee shop in which you intravenously feed coffee directly into your blood while Alexa plays adverts about the Metaverse. This would increase healthy competition with Pret and improve quality of life.~~

What can we do? Please make your coffee at home, please at least bring a reusable cup and please tell rishi we would love some small local business loans, **please don‚Äôt risk being late to class for burnt and tepid coffee.** However, if you do really want a pret subscription I don‚Äôt blame you for seeking a shred of serotonin from a crappy pret coffee that tastes like austerity measures, I blame capitalism."

Hi,  
I was fortunate enough to invest a fairly large sum of money (¬£400k) via a financial advisor in 2015, which was almost forced upon me by family for my own good as it was sat in a bank earning nothing. At first I was extremely reluctant because of the words ""invest"", ""stocks and shares etc"", and I am extremely debt and risk averse, but over the years it grew to nearly 500k. The investment was in the Prudential Pru Fund Growth fund, which is apparently a ""smoothed"" fund which has higher fees but tries to smooth over the extreme volatility direct investment can have. So for all those years it effectively acted like a high interest bank account for me, and year on year I just saw the money grow like a bank account at each financial review. Most of the money was in a bond, but each year the max amount would be put into an ISA for tax efficiency. I also had a smallish personal pension of around 70k that I let them manage too.

Less fortunately, due to illness this is likely all the money I have and will ever have. I used to work in the City in IT and had a very well paying job, but due to stress and other factors had a nervous breakdown, ended up selling my house and moving back with my retired parents. I live in a small annex on their property and thanks to them have no real living expenses, but I dont go out anywhere or do anything either. One could say that I am in an extremely bad way mental health wise, where nearly everything including basic activities is a huge effort. This means that each financial review, I would simply take the max ISA allowance from the bond, invest that into the ISA, put ¬£2880 into the pension, and take maybe ¬£2000 for myself for basic necessities like internet access, the odd book/movie etc.

Sadly, my FA1 (Financial Advisor) retired around 2019, and his business was bought out by a larger but still relatively small firm. Immediately on meeting my new appointed FA2, I wasn't keen. There was nothing specific he did that was unprofessional, but whereas the previous advisor was more like having a chat with a friendly old gentleman, this guy was very young and quite impersonal. It felt like a box ticking exercise rather than understanding my needs or goals, eg risk assessment done as is standard, here is portfolio performance etc. One thing he did do that irked me, as try to charge me to top up my ISA which the other advisor never did, but thankfully he refunded the fee. I think this put me on the backfoot as I felt the guy is much more obsessed with lining his pockets in anyway he can rather than my best interests as a priority, and if he can help with those, then his fees

Anyway, around March 2020 we were in the middle of Covid, and I happened to see on the news something like ""the fastest drop in stock market history had happened"". Now I didn't reguarly check my investments and just relied on the once a year FA review, but I decided to call the FA2 to see if I was affected as I still didnt really understand what I was invested into and perhaps should have put more time into it, but was more focused on health issues. On answering the phone, he told me that things are very bad, which looking back was certainly true. However, having been invested in my ""magic fund"" all the way through Brexit and other things, and of course paying a Financial advisor a not insignificant fee, I naively expected my investment to be fine somehow. He told me it had dropped over ¬£40k, which absolutely shocked me and basically sent me into a panic attack.

I asked ""can it get worse"", he said ""of course it can"", and I said ""well how do I stop losing more money?"" (completely unaware at the time that this is what is called a ""paper loss"" until I actually withdraw the money I hadn't lost anything), and he told me the only way to not have your money at risk is to not be invested and put it in a bank account or premium bonds or similar. Due to his blase and apathetic attitude, and perhaps the fact I was probably hysterical in comparison, and the terrible thought of ""losing more money"", I not only withdrew all the money in the bond, but also nearly 5 years of ISA allowance I had built and even put my pension into cash even though I cant touch until I am in my mid 50s (I am not near that age yet). I never even did this in the 2008 financial crisis, but alas had no FA to speak to to make me panic like this. 

The only evidence I have of his advice to withdraw everything is a brief email he sent to his secretary saying ""Client wishes to withdraw all funds in bond, isa and turn pension to cash, 't*han lose any more money in investments, which makes sense given the state of the market*s'"", as the chat was done over the phone. The FA2 told me to look at moneysavingexpert for whatever banks were paying the best rates and put the money in that. So myself, already severely unwell, was trying to somehow get this money into highstreet banks during corona, when I barely leave the house. I am angry that all I needed to hear was something akin to ""you haven't lost any money and it will recover"", but instead I got very blunt to the point negative statements, and a lot of financial speak about the markets, flights being closed, investor panic, and people locked down. 

Unfortunately, looking back, this was a huge mistake: I missed out on a massive recovery, had wiped out a decent amount of time being invested, and was now ""earning"" basically 0% on my money, with no income. But things get worse. As I had tied the money up in bank accounts paying effectively 0.5% fixed for 1 year, when everything was recovering, I couldn't just reinvest because it was locked away. I felt physically sick, and still do daily in 2023, having panic attacks at the thought of having to go back to the work I was doing because I was quite used to the small allowance I had each year and now have no income. I simply tried to forget about investing or money altogether through Covid until 2021, and had allowed myself a small sum of ¬£5000 to tide me over as even when the money was released I wasn't sure I could cope with the whole investment journey again. But it gets worse.

Once the money was released from the banks, I just had it sat in my primary bank's savings account paying 0.1% as I simply couldnt face calling around Financial Advisors and going through the process again. However, time marches on, and towards the end of 2021, I had called 3 Advisors, and as luck would have it (or not), my FA2 from before was quite a bit cheaper, already had my pension still with him (albeit in cash), and my parents had some small investment with him. It made more sense to me to pay a ¬£2000 upfront fee than a ¬£6000 one, I knew at least he picked up the phone when I called, and I felt more savvy about what I was actually invested in before, having learned of crystalising losses, time in the market vs timing the market, prufund EGRs and UPAs etc.

The risk assessment that was done came out as ""extremely cautious"", which basically meant take no risk and leave it in cash, but I was desperate to get back to the situation I had in 2015-2020 where I was basically set for retirement or even buying my own place if I ever got better, without eroding the capital. FA2 showed me that what I was invested in before was ""average risk"" and that I was quite happy with that until Corona, which is true. However, he also now had his own set of ""model portfolios"", which were a new term to me, but instead of being in a bond id be in a General Investment Account which is more tax efficient and had lower fees, and over time it had performed similar to the Pru Fund Bond but at less fees with less tax. What it didn't have of course was the smoothing mechanism which I loved. Eager to simply get back and be reinvested, I agreed to put the majority of the money in this FA2 GIA, but insisted I wanted the same Pru Fund ISA as an insurance policy, which he seemed a bit irked at but we agreed nonetheless.

We kept ¬£5000 out as an ""emergency fund"" again, and I am not sure why, but it was agreed I would pay into my pension pot the ¬£2880 from this spread over the year, as I had very little to no outgoings. I didn't think this would be a problem as I felt the investments would perform and I would make this money back. Sadly, over the year, the GIA account performed worse and worse, and I became increasingly anxious that I am paying out ¬£240 a month as my biggest expense, with no income to replace it. Again FA2 seemed to treat me as if I was some machine rather than understanding I am going to be very reluctant to spend money on anything if my capital is being eroded and I have to simply hope that at some point it would recover.

In April this year I had my financial review, and as expected, the pru fund performed much better due to the smoothing, and if I had all my money in that I would felt much happier. There have been some downward adjustments to it in may, but it sitll outperformed the FA2 GIA massively and would have allowed me to take back my ¬£2880 I had paid over the year. Unfortunately, FA2 had some other news: Not only had the GIA fund ""lost"" ¬£10000s, new government taxation meant the GIA was no longer even tax effecient so I would probably have to file tax returns if the GIA actually made any profit. FA2 suggested withdrawing the majority of the fund and putting it into an offshore bond as it doesnt look likely I will be returning to work.

This meant that I felt ""conned"" into using this GIA over what I wanted, I had spent a year hoping things would get back to where they were, and it was a waste of time anyway as the money was going to be withdrawn. I was pretty angry, told him I regret being bullied into taking his GIA and I felt like I had been conned, as yet here I am again, years later again withdrawing my money and crystalising losses. He then lost his temper and slammed the desk and apologised. A few days later he emailed me and said it makes more sense to put the money in multiple fixed savings accounts as savings rates are so high now and there is 0 risk.....

So here I am again, looking at banks to lock my money up for a year or 2, at less than inflation even at 5+% rates, with what felt like a significant pot of money 5+ years ago having been eroded in fees, crystalising losses, and needing a basic income. This means I still wont have grown the investment, even if I spend absolutely nothing and somehow live off fresh air and sit in a cupboard.

Again sorry the long and emotional post, but do any professionals have any feedback:

* Was the any or all of the advice of FA2 bad?
* Did they fail in duty of care (I have always been open about my health situation and it is quite obvious from my appearance)
* Should I be locking this money up in banks or should I try and reinvest it again?

At the end of the day I am not looking to make a fortune, I just want to know I can pay basic bills and buy food for the rest of my life through the growth of the capital until I need to start properly eroding it.

Thank you to anyone that got to the end of all that.
