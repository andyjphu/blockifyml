OriginTrail (Trac) - P/E Ratio sitting at 17!,CryptoMarkets,1hzpum2,2025-01-12 11:04:18,8,0.9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hzpum2/origintrail_trac_pe_ratio_sitting_at_17/,justaddmetoit,,"I am trying to get people's attention to the latest increase in demand for Trac-token coming from businesses after the latest release of the protocol.

This is a fundamental value play and with the latest upgrade of the DKG protocol, the increase in demand for Trac-token has now reached significant economic value. To the point that at the current state Trac is printing a P/E of 17!

I made a few posts about this on another sub-reddit. I'll just post a short summary of the financial numbers from my latest post below. Ask away if you have any questions and I'll try to answer them as best as possible.

**PS!** Demand for Trac-token is coming from actual businesses that pay Trac-tokens to nodes to upload something called ""Knowledge Assets"". In short, these KAs are data points that carry specific information tied to them. Businesses are using this protocol to build their own Decentralized Knowledge Graphs to extract and create value of their data, while also achieving data provenance due to blockchain capabilities. Just in the last 2 weeks 116,000,000 knowledge assets were published with an average cost of around $0,005 per KA, which in turn required 800,000 Trac tokens as payment. 

Here are the numbers:

**Based on the latest increase in demand these are the numbers:**

**Token price**: $0,76

**Total number of Trac-tokens**: 500 million

**Total number of Trac in circulation**: 330 million

**Earnings Per Token, tokens in circulation**: $14,592k / 330 million = 0,0442

**P/E Ratio, tokens in circulation**: $0,76 / 0,0442 = 17,19!

**P/E Ratio, fully diluted**: $0,76 / 0,0291 = 26,11

Hope this is helpful. Again, if you have any questions, just ask and I'll give it my best to explain."

Sorry for posting again.

I keep getting downvoted and told this is all fake and too good to be true. You just inspired me to keep posting because I know there are people out there that know what value looks like. So, here we go:

**Name of the token**: OriginTrail (Trac)

**Token supply**: 500 million

**ICO price 2018**: $0,10 pr. token

**Current price**: $0,74

**Current ROI from ICO**: 740%

**Network revenue 2023**: 1,183,000 Trac

**Network revenue 2024**: 7,705,000 Trac 

**Network revenue 2025** (est. *forecast based on current numbers*): 25,500,000 Trac

([Newest iteration released 2 weeks ago is expected to scale the network by x1000. We are already seeing this reflect in the demand for the Trac token](https://docs.origintrail.io/dkg-v8-current-version/whats-new-with-origintrail-v8) and forecasted revenue).

Nodes, staking, network revenue can all be found here: [https://staking.origintrail.io/](https://staking.origintrail.io/) . Some nodes related to known businesses and people:

\- Swiss Railways is running 3 nodes on all 3 different chains a 2 million Trac. **All called SBB**.

\- [Bob Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe) is running his own node called ""**Metcalfe, Hook 'em Horns**""

\- [DMaaST node](https://dmaast.eu/)

Here are some facts:

* 11,700,000 million knowledge assets published yesterday alone.
* Each knowledge asset costs between 4-7 pennies on average to publish.
* These are not txn costs. This is actual data being hashed and added to the cluster of the DKG. Expected to hit 100,000,000 per day with this upgrade.
* The lower the Trac goes in price, the higher the yields for nodes and stakers. It's already undervalued as fuck. That's why the APY is rising and is sitting at 20-25% APY currently. As long as people keep ignoring this project and the network keeps growing, the APY will continue to go up.
* No treasury, no token release, no gimmicks. Businesses purchase Trac to pay nodes. Simple as that. Stop posting nonsense from other useless tokens."

20%+ APY  and rising and people still ignore this project. Truly fascinating.,CryptoCurrency,1hwwbdl,2025-01-08 17:03:22,0,0.18,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hwwbdl/20_apy_and_rising_and_people_still_ignore_this/,justaddmetoit,DISCUSSION,"People familiar with this project are well aware of how good this project is, but it seems it stops here. I made a post the other day asking why so few people are paying attention to OriginTrail (Trac) token. You can find the post[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hv9kzx/why_arent_people_investing_in_origintrail_trac/).

They released their newest iteration of the DKG just 2 weeks ago and the Trac demand doubled instantly and has slowly been increasing since. Today, 80,000 Trac tokens went as payment to nodes.

Currently, this project, at this price, is heavily undervalued. Why? The nodes and people staking on these nodes are making over 20%+ yearly return, and it just keeps going up. Mainly due to low number of nodes (71 active nodes) and increasing demand coming 100% from businesses interacting with the DKG.

Yes, I've personally started to load up last week as I was reasonably familiar with the project since I first got introduced to it in 2021. It's time to load up here.

You can downvote me, I don't care. Just giving heads up to whoever is interested as this crypto ocean still has poop floating at the very top.

EDIT: Lot of down votes, shitty comments and ""if it's too good to be true it usually is"". This is what happens when you don't bother to even confirm what you read and just assume. One person at least bothered to take a look and check whether what I wrote is true or not and you can read his own below in the comment section. I am actually astonished by the sheer blind ignorance in this sub: 

""*I looked into it, what you’re saying checks out to me. Being used by Walmart, Home Depot, and Target. Partnerships with British Standards Institution and some other supply chain entity. I’ll toss a bit of money at it. How are you staking with your own node or* ?"" "

All tokens in circulation. 70 million are TVL in nodes that are running on the network. **At current numbers the network is yielding $20,000,000 yearly revenue for nodes and those who decided to stake their tokens.**

I'll be first to admit that I've been aware of this project for years as it is an OG project from 2017(?) or something, but it never really clicked with me for several reasons. One main factor being that utility tokens tend to require low cost for anyone to want to use them. Which has been the case here for many years hence why I wasn't as hyped as some of the people promoting this project.

Well, fast forward to this Christmas and I randomly decided to revisit this project to see how things were going. Since I first learned about this project in 2021 things seemed to move in the right direction albeit slow. Real businesses were using the technology, big names were involved in it, British Standard Institute were adamant in applying OriginTrail to everything. Looked very promising but the demand for the token was lackluster mostly due to network limits.

I'll save everyone a long read and direct you simply to the official network statistics website for OriginTrail:

[https://staking.origintrail.io/](https://staking.origintrail.io/)

The hockey stick increase that began 2 weeks ago in activity can be seen on the right chart. While Trac demand is on the left and is currently sitting at about 65-70,000 Trac per day. **This equates to $20,000,000 yearly revenue for nodes and those who decided to stake their tokens.** These tokens are being locked in nodes as payment to nodes as businesses upload data/hash it by creating something called ""knowledge assets"". All business demand, not random people or fake token lock-ups! After the upgrade to DKG v8, or Decentralized Knowledge Graph version 8, which apparently will boost 1000x increase in network capabilities a whole new dimension has opened up and is apparently in its infancy stage for global adoption.

I have personally started to stack up here, just curious why no one is paying attention? The adoption stage seem to be starting and businesses seem to be lined up to use this technology. It has basically opened up ability for any business, small or large, to build their own Knowledge Graphs, in a decentralized way.

Give me your opinions! Seems these guys have been really hard at work for 5-6 years now and things seem to be stacking up for them nicely. Token demand is directly related to businesses using the Trac token."

ongoing results using FNGU Trends strategy,LETFs,1hstqpq,2025-01-03 13:47:31,6,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LETFs/comments/1hstqpq/ongoing_results_using_fngu_trends_strategy/,LeveragedMomentum,,"I've been using a LETF strategy I call FNGU Trends in my taxable brokerage account for several years. The current balance is $1,041,927.64 (see image previously posted). One key tactic is the use of trailing stop loss orders set at 52% to avoid catastrophic losses. When a stop loss order is triggered then I wait until LETF opens back above its 120-day MA to buy again. I sell again if price drops below original stop loss level minus another 3%, buy again when it rises above the MA again, and reset the trailing stop loss floor when a new ATH is reached.

My objective in using a high percentage trailing stop loss order is to sell while the LETF is dropping during a bear market. If the bear market continues then the MA will follow the price down over several days or weeks so when the bear market ends and the LETF starts to rise again the MA buy price will be substantially below the stop price at which the LETF was sold. Losing 50%+ is painful but not nearly as painful as losing 90% or more. Avoiding that additional 30%+ loss and getting back in for another climb make sense to me.

My goal is maximum long term CAGR so I tolerate losing 50%+ every few years to earn over 70% in the other years.

I will provide performance updates on a quarterly basis. 

I have reported FNGU Trends trades to TimerTrac since April 9, 2020, for independent tracking. They currently show total return of 1,920.48% since that date which is an annualized return of 89.67% --see [http://www.timertrac.com/private/medallion.asp?mlid=%7BBC8D2239-60C5-4D47-83D9-2E3D2EADFE27%7D](http://www.timertrac.com/private/medallion.asp?mlid=%7BBC8D2239-60C5-4D47-83D9-2E3D2EADFE27%7D)"

* **Data Interoperability**: It allows different systems to communicate and exchange data seamlessly.
* **Enhanced Transparency**: Particularly in supply chains, it helps track and verify the journey of goods, ensuring authenticity and compliance.
* **Decentralization**: By operating on a decentralized network, it avoids single points of failure, making it more robust and trustworthy.

# Real-World Applications and Partnerships

TRAC isn’t just a concept; it’s delivering real-world value with active partnerships:

* **BSI (British Standards Institution)**: Used for auditing and standards verification.
* **Walmart and other Fortune 500 companies**: OriginTrail is used in supply chain transparency and logistics.
* **World Economic Forum**: Recognized as a leader in blockchain solutions, especially for advancing transparency and sustainability in global trade.
* **GS1 Standards**: OriginTrail supports GS1, the global language of business, ensuring data consistency across industries.

# Why This Matters

These partnerships prove that TRAC is more than just a token; it’s a technology that’s being adopted by some of the most influential organizations in the world. Its ability to generate **real revenue** through enterprise solutions makes it stand out in a market often crowded with speculative projects.

In times like these, it’s worth asking: *Is this project solving a real problem?* For TRAC, the answer is a resounding yes.

If you’re tired of hype and want to invest in real innovation, OriginTrail is worth a closer look.

What are your thoughts on investing in projects with real-world utility? Let’s discuss below!

OriginTrail TRAC: Bridging AI and Blockchain with Decentralized Knowledge Graphs,altcoin,1h8jkwl,2024-12-06 22:31:01,5,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1h8jkwl/origintrail_trac_bridging_ai_and_blockchain_with/,snakeo087,,"Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts,

I’ve been following u/origin_trail (TRAC) for a while, and I think it’s one of the most underrated projects in the space. They’re leveraging **Decentralized Knowledge Graphs (DKG)** to power the future of data sharing and AI.

Here’s the TL;DR:

* **What’s a DKG?** Think of it as a decentralized infrastructure for organizing and verifying data from multiple sources.
* **Why does it matter?** AI systems need trustworthy, high-quality data. DKGs provide that by ensuring transparency and interoperability.
* **Real-world applications:** OriginTrail is already being used in industries like supply chain, healthcare, and education to enable smarter AI models and real-world data sharing.

As AI continues to grow, the need for reliable, decentralized data networks will explode. TRAC seems positioned to be at the forefront of this shift.

What do you all think about this intersection of AI and blockchain? Are decentralized data solutions the next big wave?

Let me know your thoughts! 🚀🌐

I wanted to start a discussion about how **OriginTrail (TRAC)**, a project many might associate with supply chains, is leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to make a tangible impact on our world.

# What is OriginTrail?

At its core, OriginTrail is a **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** that organizes and connects data from diverse ecosystems. It’s like a global brain for trusted data, allowing different sectors like supply chain, healthcare, and Web3 to interoperate seamlessly.

# The AI Angle

OriginTrail integrates **AI technologies** to extract meaningful insights from massive datasets while ensuring that these insights are **trustworthy and tamper-proof**. For example:

1. **Supply Chain Optimization**: AI models running on the DKG can predict disruptions and improve efficiency in logistics.
2. **Sustainability Monitoring**: AI-driven data analysis helps businesses meet compliance standards like carbon tracking, enabling real environmental impact.
3. **Healthcare Solutions**: In pharmaceuticals, OriginTrail ensures the authenticity of medicines while AI helps analyze and predict trends in data.

# Why It Matters

AI's potential is often limited by the **quality and trustworthiness of the data** it uses. OriginTrail’s DKG bridges this gap by ensuring data integrity and interoperability, making AI applications more reliable and impactful.

# Let’s Discuss

* **Have you come across other blockchain projects integrating AI like this?**
* **What’s your take on the role of trusted data in maximizing AI’s potential?**
* **Where else could OriginTrail's AI capabilities be applied?**

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 🚀"
AI Crypto Projects by Revenue: How Does OriginTrail $TRAC Compare?,CryptoCurrencyTrading,1h4qm7d,2024-12-02 03:42:24,43,0.98,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/1h4qm7d/ai_crypto_projects_by_revenue_how_does/,snakeo087,DISCUSSION,"I put together a table ranking some top AI-driven crypto projects by their revenue and market caps. It’s intriguing to see how OriginTrail ($TRAC) stands out with a strong revenue-to-market cap ratio compared to other projects:

|Project|Revenue (Last 12 Months)|Market Cap|Revenue/Market Cap %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|**NEAR**|$8M|$7.08B|\~0.11%|
|**OriginTrail (TRAC)**|$5.6M|$0.407B|\~1.38%|

|**AKT**|$1.05M|$0.98B|\~0.11%|
|**LPT**|$0.31M|$0.39B|\~0.08%|

# Key Observations:

1. **TRAC’s Undervaluation**: TRAC’s revenue-to-market cap ratio of \~1.38% is still far ahead of its peers. Despite a slightly higher market cap ($407M), it remains undervalued relative to its revenue compared to other projects.
2. **Real-World Usage**: TRAC powers OriginTrail’s Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is already being adopted in supply chain, healthcare, and enterprise ecosystems. This makes it a utility-first project rather than one driven by speculation.
3. **Growth Potential**: With TRAC sitting at $407M in market cap, it has substantial upside. Scaling to market caps like RNDR or ICP (in the billions) would represent significant gains for holders, especially given its revenue metrics.

**Questions for Discussion**:

* Does TRAC’s revenue efficiency indicate its potential for larger adoption and market cap growth?
* Should market valuations better reflect actual revenue performance?
* What’s your take on TRAC compared to projects like RNDR or ICP in terms of innovation and utility?

Not only do they have a working product, they have real adoption and daily revenue that’s been sharply increasing.   Meanwhile this project is under a 500 mil mc.  I really can’t wrap my head around it. I can’t get myself to buy into rug pulls and VC pumps but maybe I’m just dumb or not cut out for this space.  I try to convince myself crypto will mature but I don’t see any signs of it."
How come Trac stood strong whilst every other hype project failed over the last 3 years.,CryptoCurrency,1gsmhtm,2024-11-16 07:43:46,18,0.68,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gsmhtm/how_come_trac_stood_strong_whilst_every_other/,mogzy_d1,DEBATE,"Question as per the title, when I got into crypto a few years ago it was simply to make money and it still is. I don’t care about the tech I wasn’t even bothered with the utility.

I picked up a little bag here and a little bag there of any of the hype projects and to be fair I done pretty well if I cashed out. Once the projects hit their ATH I didn’t sell I held all the way to the bottom expecting more.

Now my question is out of all the projects Origintrail (TRAC) has stayed strong yet it’s never talked about. Is there still people invested here and it’s going under the radar? Or have I been lucky and it’s time to cash out with profit for once?"

Section IV.M.2.a.lii: OriginTrail (TRAC)  
  
Empowering Trust and Transparency: The Role of TRAC Token in OriginTrail's Decentralized Knowledge Graph  
  
Abstract  
  
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the need for trust and transparency in data management has become paramount. OriginTrail, a decentralized knowledge graph, emerges as a pioneering solution to address these challenges across diverse sectors ranging from supply chain management to credential verification. At the heart of OriginTrail lies the Trace (TRAC) token, an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency designed to power the network's operations. This abstract delves into the pivotal role of the TRAC token within the OriginTrail ecosystem, elucidating its function as the medium of exchange for data processing and storage. Furthermore, it explores how TRAC incentivizes network participants, ensuring the integrity and reliability of data while fostering collaboration and innovation. Through an analysis of OriginTrail's decentralized architecture and the economic dynamics enabled by the TRAC token, this abstract sheds light on the transformative potential of decentralized knowledge graphs in redefining trust and transparency in the digital age.

Mont Blanc vs King MT 2 vs Lone Peak 8,AltraRunning,1el89a2,2024-08-06 00:02:01,10,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1el89a2,Feenstra713,,"So I've about hit how many miles I want to put, on every shoe I currently own, and am going to get some new shoes. I noticed that they just re-released the King MT 2's and was looking at them, but have fairly little experience with them. As a trail/mud runner, I'm looking between them, the Mont Blanc's, the Lone Peak 8's, and am having a hard time picking what's good, being that all three shoes are (at least for now) within $10 of each other. So I'm order to decide, I'm writing a somewhat deep comparison.

All three shoes are zero mm drop.

When it comes to uppers, the Blanc has a light weight breathable mesh, the Kings have regular mesh, and the LP has an anti-rip mesh.

Both the LP's and the Kings have Altra Ego midsoles, while the Blanc's have Altra Ego Max midsoles.

Both the Kings and the Blanc's have a Vibram lite base with mega grip outer sole, while the LP's have a MaxTrac outersole.

When it comes to weight, in order from heaviest to lightest we have the LP's, Kings, Blanc's. (303g, 292g, 280g)

When it comes to cushion, in order from least to greatest we have the Kings, LP's, Blanc's. (19mm, 25mm, 30mm)

One of the most important things about Altra is the FootShape! Sadly, only the LP's has the original FootShape, while both the Kings and the Blanc's have standard FootShape (which is still better than the slim FootShape IMO) 

Additional differences; both the LP's and King's have a stone guard, and a gaiter trap, but the Blanc's do not have either of these. Even though all three are for the trails, the Blanc's and the Kings are for more technical trail racing while the LP's are more aimed for more simple trail running. 


The LP's are the only shoe of the three with a MaxTrac sole, and an anti-rip mesh, but they are also the only shoe with the original foot shape! For those of us who really require this for a comfortable run, this alone may be enough to convince us to get this shoe.

The Blanc's are however the only shoe of the three that has a rockered design, meaning that even though you won't feel the ground as well as the other two, it will be able to propel you forward better and more efficiently, making it easier and less painful to run for longer (if you're used to rockered shoes). 

Finally, the Kings have several features that neither other shoe has. Firstly, it has a drainage system, and far more aggressive lugs to drain your shoes of water, give you that extra grip you need on muddy or loose surfaces.


Overall, the Mont Blanc's are great shoes, designed more for longer technical trail races. Between the larger stack height, light weight construction, smaller toe box, super grippy soles, and the rocker sole, it makes a faster and more efficient shoe. (Down hills are apparently pretty rough due to the shoe not holding on great, through this may be able to be resolved with by lacing your shoes with a runners knot)

Overall, the Kings are great shoes which seem to be designed for short to medium length technical trail races, mud runs, and obstacle courses races. Between the light weight, super grippy soles, gaiter trap, stone guard, minimal stack height, drainage system and Velcro support, this shoe will keep your feet still, and give you as much grip as possible on loose and muddy surfaces. 

Overall, the Lone Peak 8's are great shoes which seem to be designed more for long slow hikes, or medium length, less technical trail runs. They are designed for those looking for versatility and comfort, especially because of that original footshape."

The third category includes assets that attempt to solve AI-related problems, including the rise of bots, deepfakes and content provenance.

A significant problem exacerbated by AI is the proliferation of bots and misinformation. AI-generated deepfakes have already been shown to impact presidential elections in India and Europe,[^(\[22\])](https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/ai-is-coming-crypto-can-help-make-it-right#_ftn22) and experts are “completely terrified” that the upcoming presidential race will involve a “tsunami of misinformation” driven heavily by deepfakes.[^(\[23\])](https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/ai-is-coming-crypto-can-help-make-it-right#_ftn23) Assets looking to help solve issues related to deepfakes through establishing verifiable content provenance include Origin Trail (TRAC), Numbers Protocol (NUM), and Story Protocol. In addition, Worldcoin (WLD) attempts to solve the issue of bots by proving a person’s humanity through unique biometric identifiers.

Another risk in AI is ensuring trust in the models themselves. How do we trust that the AI results that we receive are not doctored or manipulated? Currently, there are several protocols working to help solve this problem through cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), including Modulus Labs and Zama.[^(\[24\])](https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/ai-is-coming-crypto-can-help-make-it-right#_ftn24)

Replacing tires for the first time on my '22 Silverado 1500.  Any suggestions? Just over 60K miles on stock Grabbers.,Silverado,1dx6hv4,2024-07-06 22:52:49,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Silverado/comments/1dx6hv4/replacing_tires_for_the_first_time_on_my_22/,blackjakals,,"This is my first time owning a truck and really know next to nothing when it comes to trucks.  It is time to replace the original tires (General Grabbers) and I am trying to decide what to pick next.  I do want something different than what I have now.  Current tires are 275/60R20.

I like the look of all-terrain tires, but I drive mostly on the highway and city roads and do little to no driving on anything besides that.  The main reason for all-terrains would be for better traction in the snow (I live in Utah) and then the bad ass looks.  My General Grabbers overall have been great, even in winter driving.  I am actually surprised they even lasted over 60K as with every new car I have owned (I have had two of them) the stock tires haven't lasted more than 45K.  

It is time for a change.  The tires I am looking at for replacement are either other all-seasons, all-terrains, or a mix of both.  Here's the list:

* Michelin Defender LTX M/S
* Michelin Defender LTX A/T
* Continental TerrainContact A/T
* Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac
* BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2
* BFGoodrich Trail-Terrain T/A
* Scorpion All Terrain Plus
* Toyo Open Country A/T 3

That's the list right now.  Any suggestions?  Also, the dealership told me the highest tire size they recommend I go up to is a 285/60R20 if I put in a 2"" leveling kit.  What do y'all think?"

These are often called the ""picks and shovels"" or ""infra"" (short for infrastructure) of web3. The most significant advantages of web3 projects are security, scalability, and cost.

Get ready. Here are long lists of some these projects maybe worth a look (meaning look into tokenomics, team, partnerships, etc.) It may be easier to use [Coingecko.com](http://Coingecko.com) categories (that's where I got them):
