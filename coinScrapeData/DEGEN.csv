I paid a prostitute ti have sex with thinking how different could it be and paid her and she came and while i was doing it i felt nothing her boobs vagina all felt nothing but a piece of meat to me, she tried her best to make me cum but couldnt and then i realized that at that moment ""a women whom i love and like the most only needs to glance at me and ill relapse but this professional one of the best at her at that was trying and trying and couldnt she kept on saying ""hajur kasto horw yeti garda pani nw jharney"" ik it all sounds so degenerative and low-level tr i feel like camus at this point and have realized that many people have no personality and i didnt even wanted to kiss her not because she was dirty or something i paid really high one of the best if i have to say but i felt as if i was dirtying my mouth from her kiss and when i remember my first kiss with my ex that that thatttt is what i kill kiss my heart was pounding i was in the moment just her and just mee but at this time i felt as if she was the only one enjoying, and i kept staring at the darkness and then i saw the darkness within me, i mean i had glorified sex i had make it the epitome of my existance and yet i discarded that one thing that i had holded so dear to me just like that as if it was another day, maile ulai sodhey timlai maile jau bhaney bhaney janxau ani uley bhani awh lina aaunxan i pity her and when i looked at her she told me not to look like that i said well everyone does but she said something i think that everyone might say tr she said that gaze with which i was seeing her made her question everything, after that she was reluctant to go as she tried ti flirt with me more trying to kiss me but her kisses felt no more mere pebbles which melts on earths atmosphere before even reaching it but the meaningful past that i had shared with some people felt as if it could destroy the whole dinosaurs race,so now that she is gone and i am left here i dont think of her at all at this day i am sure to not remember as the first time i had paid sex but as the time where i got to know a bit closer to the reality of us human nothing but flesh, for her i had shaved my pubic hair cleaned up perfectly and she who was dirtied didnt wanted to even shower i made her a bit clean but it doesnt feel like ive lost something ill say ive become a virgin once again longing for that meaningful relationship  that once i had with someone , to people who are still reading i wont say nw garw cuz by some experiences you grow and if you think there are some experiences that you need to have then make the choicee now, normally it mightve felt like oh damn i am gigachad made everyone cum and i lasted for idk how many hours tr it rather makes me question myself ki if i was with someone i love i wouldnt even last a minute 

So i quote thee here"" i would rather last just a minute with the person i love then last for eternity with a thot"" 

And with this encounter i found something really meaningful about myself, all those nofaps and everything are just a mind game i heard jhonny sins reply to a question how do you last so longer and he replied ""well i just think and when i want to i just do"" maybe professionalism but now i understand it all those freaking ill help you get laid are actually losers not losers but losssers of true valuable meaning of a connection ,guys sex is not the game ,life is the game and sex is just a  small part of it. So choose wisely

Lastly i gotta check for any stds or hiv test just incase!"
My cervical and lumbar is real bad,ChronicPain,1i9x6ye,2025-01-25 16:12:42,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x6ye,hatepain77,,If my PCP Dr doesn't care should I get a spinal fusion or go to good orthopedic.

I had the choice between the arthroplasty and a typical posterior fusion, and I decided to go with the artifical disc. Moderate SCI symptoms that resolved quickly after the surgery. (Neurosurgeon #1)

04/24 Revision surgery (C5/C6 posterior fusion) as bone spurs had developed on the back side of the artificial disc, re-injuring my spinal cord and causing permanent damage. Moderate SCI symptoms returned (prior to surgery), myelopathy & spasticity in all limbs/extremities, gasping and shortness of breath (phrenic nerve damage/compression), foot drop, incontinence and constipation issues. (Neurosurgeon #2)

01/25 Cervical disc has started collapsing towards the front, pulling the vertebrae above and below out of place, causing my spinal cord to 'bowstring' through the cervical column. At this point, neurosurgeon #2 referred me to one of the top spinal cord injury + neurosurgeons in the country as my symptoms were worsening rapidly by the week. Fused C2-T1 to get everyone realigned and locked back into place. (Neurosurgeon #3). Now we wait and see what happens. Recovery has been hell.

33, degenerative disc disease + undifferentiated connective tissue disease, strong suspicion of another autoimmune disease at play, but we can't quite pin down which one yet. 

It's been a roller coaster to say the least. In hindsight, I should have just gone with the C5/C6 fusion and who knows how much of this could have been avoided. I've learned a lot more about these artificial discs and whether or not they're actually a good substitute for a typical fusion. 

Sharing my experiences as my partner and I did not feel well-informed about the cervical disc and its potential complications. It was absolutely NOT a good option for me given my history with UCTD + excess scar tissue + predisposition to forming bone spurs. Hindsight is 20/20, and now I'm left with a permanent spinal cord injury that has completely altered mine & my partner's life goals/plans. It really, really sucks. I'm so tired."
"The Subtle Abuse of a Covert Narcissist: When ""Accidents"" Are Anything But",narcissisticparents,1i9vyn4,2025-01-25 15:18:11,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1i9vyn4/the_subtle_abuse_of_a_covert_narcissist_when/,NegotiatingRemainsEG,,"Covert narcissists have a unique way of inflicting harm while maintaining an innocent, remorseful facade. They use excuses, false empathy, and fabricated conditions to cover up their destructive behavior, leaving their victims questioning reality. These actions often manifest in subtle but repetitive physical harm, disguised as accidents or mistakes. Over time, the cumulative effect of this ""accidental"" abuse becomes undeniable. This is my personal account of living with someone who fit this description and how their behavior left me physically and emotionally wounded.

I have knee issues, a degenerative disease, and an injury. When sitting near him, I’d often curl my legs to one side. He would grab me by the ankle or lower leg and yank me toward him, causing pain and injury. This wasn’t an occasional occurrence—it happened hundreds of times over the years. Each time, he’d act surprised and apologetic, saying, “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. I was thinking about something else,” or, “You know I have ADHD—I can’t help it.” But his so-called ADHD was fabricated, just another excuse in his arsenal to avoid accountability.

Eventually, I stopped sitting near him because I knew what would happen. The same pattern extended to bedtime. He would curl up to me in bed and hug me so tightly that it felt like my ribs were being crushed. I’d tell him it hurt, but again, I’d hear the same excuses: “I didn’t realize,” “I was half-asleep,” or “I wasn’t thinking.” This cycle continued until I couldn’t bear to sleep near him anymore.

I also have a herniated disc with pinched nerve, and a bulging disc in my neck. He knew how how suseptible, weak it was, yet when driving, he would whip the car to one side or make abrupt moves that sent sharp pain shooting through my body. When I’d point it out, his responses were always the same: “Oh, I wasn’t paying attention,” or “I didn’t think it would hurt that much.” After countless incidents, I eventually stopped riding in the car with him.

These weren’t isolated incidents—they were part of an ongoing pattern. Covert narcissists are masters of disguising their abusive behavior as carelessness or forgetfulness. They repeatedly harm you while insisting it’s unintentional, forcing you to question whether it’s truly accidental or something more insidious. When the same ""accidents"" happen hundreds of times, year and year, it becomes clear: they were never accidents at all.

Be safe out there. ✌️ ❤️ "

We live near one another and hang out all the time.  He was recently diagnosed with a degenerative brain disease. It's genetic and runs in his family. So we aways knew there was a chance he would have it. There is currently no cure or treatment. 

He's 40 now and sufferers rarely live into their 60s. The next ten years are going to be very bad in terms of disability. Today he showed the first signs of neurpoathy in his hands and feet. He was also struggling to balance and walk.

For the first time I think it hit me. The sheer horror of what's going to happen to one of the best and kindest people I know. I genuinely would swap places with him if I could. I can't imagine watching this happen to him.

I keep trying to stay positive and keep up a good face for him. But today I pulled over on the way back from his house and cried in the car for an hour.

Has anyone been in thsi situation and can they tell me how to support my friend while dealing with this grief? "

Emergency vet thinks it's degenerative myelopathy and wants to do an MRI in a few days, but I'm hesitant to do so because TJ would have to have anesthesia. She also absolutely hates the vet and being in a cone, a cage, anything like that and it would cause her so much stress. 

She doesn't appear to be in any pain (she's on pain killers, but even before we took her to the vet she seemed like her sweet self besides not being able to walk), she eats and drinks like a champ, still loves being stroked. Her blood work came back completely clear, which the vet said was amazing considering her age.  

My heart hurts and I can't stop crying. It's so unfair that just because she can't move her hind legs, we might have to make a very tough, very sad decision soon. If she was in pain, if she seemed like she didn't want to be here anymore, if she had loads of illnesses, I think I would find it a lot easier to let her go. I hate this so much. 

I don't even know the point of this post. I guess I just felt the desire to share this with a community who understands."

The main concern is the size and location of the mass at c2/c3. His degenerative disc disease likely caused those to fuse some time ago. The mass has mostly eaten away the bone. The mass has consumed most of the space in the area. He had pain in his neck for a few weeks leading up to a visit to the ER. The pain is getting worse and that is my main concern. I’m not sure we can get through two weeks of radiation and wait however long it might take for the mass to reduce in size. We have been told there are no surgical options because of location and size and that we must get it shrink first. His pain is wide eyed and more extreme than anything I’ve ever seen before. He changes color and sweat starts pouring off of him. He begins shaking and thinking he’s dying. I can’t fully convey how much pain he is in. He finds relief occasionally but is only able to maintain it if he doesn’t move his neck. We have him in a Miami J brace.  It’s difficult to get him up to eat. I think we need to get to MD Anderson, but I can’t make that happen until we kick off the conversation on Monday. Is there anything I can be doing? The cancer researcher on ChatGPT has evidence of surgical procedures reducing pain in patients with similar size and location masses. The local people we are dealing with do not have the experience to do anything other than open surgery from the back which is out of the question according to them. I’m feeling helpless. "

So for over 4 years I’ve had hip pain and lower back pain, however I just assumed the back pain was stemming from my hips. Couple years ago I was diagnosed with hip impingement and a labral tear in my right hip. A little over a year ago I had surgery to fix the tear and impingement but I still have the pain I was having before the surgery. Recently it’s gotten debilitating where I can barely walk, can’t sit for too long, and can’t sleep very good. I was booked for an MRI for a year and a half from now (May of 2026) considering the pain I’ve been in for the past few weeks  knew I couldn’t wait that long so I paid to have an mri on both my hips and my lumbar spine, I just had the mri a week ago and got my results. My right hip is fixed so obviously wasn’t a failed surgery (that was what I thought was happening) but I have the same impingement and a labral tear in my left hip and I have degenerative disc disease in my L3-L4 and L4-L5 and an irritated L4 Nerve on the right side. I was able to see my family doctor to talk about it and he said I’m very young to have degenerative disc disease (I’m 23F). He also told me the impingement and labral tear in my hip is probably not causing any of the pain and it’s just the DDD but that confused me because my left hip still really bothers me also and if the irritated nerve is in the right side then how come my left hip still bothers me so much. He suggested I try injections in my spine and he’s convinced it will “cure” me. I see my physiatrist next week where I will probably get more answers. 

I guess I’m just asking if anyone has had similar issues with their hips and this DDD and what it looked like for them? Will this be something that will affect me for the rest of my life? I used to be very active, playing volleyball, surfing, skiing. Now I can barely even walk and I just want to get back to my old life. I’ll be grateful for any help and advice. Thank you! "

"Ross Ulbricht, founder of The Silk Road just got pardoned by Trump",ClientlessCopywriting,1i9orl1,2025-01-25 10:02:17,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClientlessCopywriting/comments/1i9orl1/ross_ulbricht_founder_of_the_silk_road_just_got/,ClientlessCopy,,"Just a few days ago I wrote about how Epstein, Hunter Biden, Elon and many other rich elites get away with extremely ridiculous crimes that normal law abiding citizens would never get away with and that the underlying reason is they can get away is corruption.

Ulbricht(german for Noble/bright/famous), the prolific poster child of the dark web, unfortunately didn't have such corruption on his side. No friends in high places for him sadly.

Or maybe he just arrested during a time of less corruption.

But Trump gave him his lucky break, despite previously saying drug dealers should receive the death penalty.

If you don't know, President Trump has been signing executive orders immediately upon his inauguration, left and right(do they even have any meaning when he signs them as often as he does?) to the point that memes are being made.

And one executive order of his is promoting Bitcoin and AGI(artificial general intelligence), through Sam Altman and openAi.

Trump wants America to be the world center for bitcoin and A.I

But today, the conversation isn't about trump and his executive order, that's boring political stuff. Instead today, it's about Ross Ulbritcht, founder of Silk road and DPR(Dread Pirate Roberts) himself! And what this all means.

See Ulbricht, graduated with a bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Texas at Dallas and a master’s degree in materials science and engineering from Pennsylvania State University, and during or shortly *after* university, he became deeply influenced by libertarian ideologies, particularly those advocating for free markets and individual freedoms.

So motivated by these beliefs, he launched **Silk Road** in **February 2011**, at the age of **26**(nearly the same age as me), as a dark web marketplace designed to operate beyond government control.

The platform utilized Tor also called The Onion Router for user anonymity and **Bitcoin** for transactions, rapidly becoming a hub for illegal drug sales and other illicit activities.

Essentially, Tor is a tool that lets you browse the internet anonymously by routing your connection through multiple servers (nodes) around the world, hiding your identity and location. Each server only knows part of the path, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace your activity back to you. It's commonly used for privacy, bypassing censorship, or accessing hidden websites on the dark web.

It's for these reasons that Silk road drew in almost 100,000 users, made millions(183m) in sales, transactions and sales 13m for Ulbricht himself in just the 2 years and a half years it was open.

Untraceable users with Tor anonymity coupled with nearly untraceable **Bitcoin** for transactions made it a hub primarily for illegal drug sales, counterfeit goods like forged IDs, hacking tools and services, guns, and general Paraphernalia.

But after a **two-year investigation**, Ulbricht was arrested by the FBI on **October 1, 2013**, in a sting operation at the age of **29**, while using a public library in San Francisco.

Operating under the pseudonym **“Dread Pirate Roberts,”** he was charged with multiple crimes, including conspiracy to traffic narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking.

In **2015**, Ulbricht was convicted on seven charges and sentenced to **double life imprisonment without the possibility of parole**.

Now doing some more research, he *could've* gotten away it, if he had more opsec( Operational security).

Opsec is a method for protecting critical information from adversaries. It's used to prevent adversaries from gaining access to information that could be used to harm people, resources, or disrupt missions.

In our case, Ulbricht could've *completely* hidden his identity.

Instead he accidentally used used his real name on an online forum to promote his site, used stack overflow, which was traced back to him. And reused the username ""Altoild"", which was tied to his gmail. Bitcoin is also pseudo anonymous by design so there are public ledgers, meaning the transaction histories are public.

That's why today, people use other crypto, like Monero, which hides a lot more of the transaction history.

Supposedly Ulbrichts biggest mistake was the IP address of the server for the site being available on captcha.

Regardless, they had enough on him, and maybe some more high tech, some DARPA shyt, that could trace him.

When they arrested him in the public library, they were able to distract him and gain access to his opened laptop, with the master or admin account of the silk road in addition to a wallet with 144,000 bitcoin($28m then) which today, is worth $14B. Yes Billions.

Unfortunately the feds also sold his bitcoin back when they were just worth a few hundred dollars, auctioning them to buyers.

And while rarely anyone argues Ulbricht was a good guy(he supposedly also tried to carry out hits on people, but never got charged for this), his case was controversial due to the nature of his site and polemics, as well his harsh sentencing(2 life sentences), where murders got off with a lot less.

Trump has in addition likely also freed him due to his(Trump's) dislike of the deep state. 

He wants to maintain that image of that drain the swap stuff. Which is totally real, Hunter Biden corruption and all that.

But i personally wouldn't write Trump off as not *also b*eing deep state himself.

These rich folk *all* know each other, it's a small world after all.

Anyway, you might not like Ulbricht, i'm not sure I like him like that, he's like Walter white, but *actually* real. its hard *not* to root for the guy. He's incredibly cool, and not just because he likes The Princess Bride.

But because he was able to live life how *he wanted*, have the *balls* to start his own shyt(silk road), read the market on bitcoin, be fabulously rich *just* off that, and find *his* people to then give them what *they* want; like minded degen hackers and tech guys that buy up weed, shrooms and erotica.

See Ulbritcht was a storyteller, a world-builder. *All his users lived in his world*, just like J.K Rowling's billion dollar Harry Potter empire.

Where people buy up merch, memorabilia and talk about the series *to this day. Rowling* still makes a commission/royalty on the Harry Potter films. And who knows what else she makes on the entire franchise?

Ulbricht sucked you in and made you hate the government and their bureaucracy and control. Libertarians in general want as little government control as possible.

I'm sort of the same.

Because uncle Sam wants his grubby little hands everywhere and it's insane how much we pay in tax and how little we benefit as Americans from the government.

What happened to social contract theory? To the reason why fought the British Crown?

See Ulbricht was an enemy of the state, they didn't like that he wasn't just a lapdog tax payer working his wagie job. 

And his site was a message of his lifestyle and philosophy. That of total freedom and profiteering.

He sent the message to his followers and users, through DPR, that

""every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is victory for those individuals taking part in those transactions. So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state"".

He built this world evocative of the ancient silk road trade routes, where they traded all manner of things without much interference. Where no one governed you.

That's why there's so much controversy about his harsh sentences. 

He tipped the sacred cow.

Now i'm not endorsing you to do anything illegal, but we should all be a bit more like Ulbricht.

We ought to go against the grain and not be afraid to tip some sacred cows ourselves.

Thats where freedom and wealth is.

By *all* metrics, Ulbricht is clientless minded.

Freedom minded.

And who knows what he'll do next.

Supposedly he has $44m locked away in Bitcoin somewhere that the feds haven't touched.

Maybe thats why he's smiling in his release photo.

Bro is scheming. lol.

But even if he lost it all, he could make it all back, because Ulbricht is Ulbricht, he's one of one. His personality makes him an apex predator.

He isn't a sheep.

He isn't the type to lose. He's bred for excellence and you can bet he'll either lay low with his millions(if he has them) and wait for all this to blow over(maybe in a different country) or go all in and maybe end up on Joe Rogan(another clientless operator).

I bet *in jail* this guys mind was racing, learning, thinking of the upside, even if he was resigned to never getting out.

Guys like him are just different.

And you probably are too.

That's why you should be *doing* ***all that can be done*** to change your life.

So build your own shyt,

build a world that people love to be in and hate to leave.

And make it LinkedIn verified and all that so uncle Sam can't take it away.

You'll explore who you are underneath, and probably get rich from it.

A unique offer compounded with time, hard-work and being on the bleeding edge *will* do that.

Your pal,

Fathi"

Finding tokens with great potential has been a challenge for years, compounded by high gas fees almost everywhere.  
  
Recently, I discovered an AI-powered system that alleviates this stress. It analyzes coins from A to Z and identifies those suitable for my trading style. The AI is integrated into the Bitget Seed phase, where it automatically selects and ranks tokens based on specific factors. It also allows me to trade them directly with USDT without gas fees after updating my app.  
  
This has significantly streamlined my trading strategy, reducing the time I spend researching tokens. It feels like an easy route for me. But what do you think?"

Here’s the story of how a rugged project turned into one of the most exciting community-driven tokens on Solana.

# The Rise, Fall, and Comeback of $COPEX

When $COPEX first launched, it had everything:

* A killer ticker.
* Slick artwork.
* A dev promising big things like **burning 66% of the supply** and launching **COPE AI.**

But behind the hype, the dev held 66% of the supply, and instead of delivering, he eventually rugged the token, tanking it to $4k MC.

For most projects, that’s the end of the road. But the $COPEX community wasn’t having it. They CTOed the project, took back control, and are now building something even stronger.

# COPE AI: The Game-Changer

The community takeover is doing what the dev never could. The first COPE AI tool, Rug Detector, is currently being built and will use AI to detect rug pulls on Solana in real time. This isn’t just about tech—it’s about giving the community the tools to fight back.

With more tools on the way and another reveal planned at 300k MC, $COPEX is just getting started.

# Why $COPEX?

This isn’t just a token, it’s a movement. A rallying cry for degens who’ve been rugged one too many times. The $COPEX community is here to show that with unity, transparency, and resilience, we can rewrite the story of what a meme token can be.

I have been spiraling for months because of this neurally degenerative disease. All I see online for advice is take your meds everyday and engage your mind. What if I feel like that’s still not enough? Yes, I don’t engage my mind as I need to. I keep procrastinating on reading and Duolingo but I’m a student so I’m still doing something. I feel insecure about my memory and how I forget what word I wanna use as I’m talking. 

I listened to a huberman lab podcast episode about how caffeine, l-theanine, and nicotine (surprisingly) can help you focus iirc. Apparently caffeine is bad for us 😭 and I don’t want to try nicotine. Also I have to drink coffee everyday or I’m yawning the whole day even if I sleep 8+ hours. I don’t want to drink more when I want to study because I get jittery. 

Maybe this is a hypomanic rant overall, but I get so anxious thinking about how my cognitive abilities will gradually decline. Is there anything I can do to bring back what I’ve lost? I saw lithium is like the only medication that helps w that but I don’t think it’s for me and I don’t want to try it. Any advice is helpful :)"

I was pretty much told it was nothing to be worried about and it's pretty common. this past year i visited a different neurologist who took me serious and explained what could happen if i wasn't careful and asked me if i had back pain and id been complaining of some pretty bad back pain for the past year as well as weakness i had countless blood tests done even a spinal xray he said he wanted to get a spinal mri this time aswell to see if i had a syrinx. i started having some really bad burning pain on the back of my neck that wouldn't go away even after plenty ibuprofen and advil so i went to the hospital and they also didn't take me serious just gave me a iv cocktail and some benadryl to knock me out id been there all night and they did a mri of my head and neck my chiari was the same. i got my spinal MRI done and i was diagnosed with juvenile degenerative disc disease im 15 years old so i took this as a shock ive never injured my back never been into sports im a ballerina.. my mri scans looked pretty bad about 5 or 6 of my discs looked completely black and my spine appeared withered almost the nurse practitioner drew attention back to my chiari and said its size was impressive she gave me a referral to duke nuerosurgery for both the chiari and the discs. does anybody have any idea if the two correlate. my symptoms are pretty severe and ontop of this i have dysautomnia (POTS) which i believe i developed after my PAPVR repair when i was 3 so my day to day is quite the struggle i have chronic fatigue the most insane muscle weakness numbness (kind of like pins and needles sometimes) in my legs hands and feet. sometimes it gets so bad in my legs that i completely freeze or it becomes painful. my pain shoots down my legs or i get a bad aching pain behind the knee and elbow. my pain is not only in my back but my neck often so bad it hurts just to hold my head up. the headaches have definitely gotten worse some are short lived but more often than not they're prolonged. and don't even get me started on the brain fog... i'm in pain every second of everyday. i feel like a little old lady... and i'm curious what my appointment with the neurosurgeon will look like as both my conditions have the same symptoms and what the treatment is going to be. or how they're going to go about finding the cause of my degenerative discs.. i'm not open to pain meds as i've been on them since i was 12 and i feel they do more harm then good and don't really help. i'm looking for somebody who may also be in a similar situation to mine who can maybe give advice or some insight... my medical record goes deep i think i may just be unlucky😅
AI AGENT META: Getting rugged today and my new strategy for trading this gong show.,SolanaMemeCoins,1i9gbgp,2025-01-25 00:45:45,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeCoins/comments/1i9gbgp/ai_agent_meta_getting_rugged_today_and_my_new/,DavidFel250,,"So I've made a lot of money off getting in fairly early on AI16Z, DegenAI, UOS, and a couple other AI agent tokens. But lately the majority of them have been turning into meme coin rug pulls. Devs are getting smarter and smarter at larping as honest builders trying to create something of value but are actually just quick or slow rugging its holders. But after trading this meta aggressively for the last 4 months or so I think I've decided to change my strategy.

Before I would get say a 100%-300% win on a banger, then buy back in with about half of my profits on a big dip. But that dip just keeps dipping 80% of the time.

Today I got rugged on xcrew, an AI agent framework backbiting off a bigger AI Firm. Their project looked so legit, even had coding on Github and had a solid roadmap and dev showed that he knew what he was doing. Even posted a screenshot on X that the CEO of this big AI firm was going to check it out. Price went from 200K to 6M over about 30 minutes. I sold my entire bag at about 4M. Price dipped down to 1.3M later that day so I bought in half my profits. 20 mins later it rugged, CEO of the firm posted he has no affiliation or support for this token and then Dev even admitted that the photo was photoshopped on X. By the time i saw this it was too late. quickest $900 I've ever lost. Still walked away with about $1000 in profit but it really made me resent the crypto space today. SO to guarantee long term profits in this greasy space I am planning on pulling all my profits on the first pump and walking away for good from every project I invest in from now on.

What are your guys thought and if you trade this meta what is your strategy?? Would love some input."

Struggling to find the next big meme coin?

You’re not alone. Every week, many coins explode in value, and most people only hear about them when it’s too late. Here’s the good news: spotting these gems early isn’t rocket science. You just need the right approach and tools.

Let’s break it down.

# Why Meme Coins?

Meme coins like **ai16z** and **Zerebro** turned early investors into millionaires. The appeal is simple: **low entry costs, high reward potential, and community-driven hype.**

Now, the goal isn’t to gamble blindly. It’s to identify **coins with real narratives, strong communities, and momentum** before they hit the mainstream.

# Step 1: Use Photon-Sol Trending Page and Other Trackers

**Photon-sol Link -** [**https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io**](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/@ma004)

You can’t find a trending coin without the right tools. **Photon-Sol Trending Page,** is the goldmine. Here’s how:

1. **Set Filters on Photon-Sol**:

* Minimum Market Cap: $300,000
* Maximum Age: 50 hours (the newer, the better)
* Minimum Volume: $2,000,000 in 24 hours

[Trending Page Photon-Sol](https://preview.redd.it/xdw6z4cye2fe1.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8bf1dedcb10a9fb636dc48b8d88a0745aa3b75)

**Sort by Volume and Liquidity:**

* High volume means attention.
* Solid liquidity ensures the coin isn’t a rug pull waiting to happ

# How to Spot These:

* Scroll through **Crypto Twitter** (more on this in Step 3).
* Search for new trends like “AI Agents” or “Community Coins” popping up in discussions.
* Look for projects that combine **new technology with an easy-to-understand meme.**

# Step 2: Watch on X for gems

X and Telegram are **ground zero** for meme coin hype.

# X Tips:

* Search hashtags like **#AI**, **#memecoin**, or specific keywords like “Solana meme coins.”
* Follow influencers who frequently post about crypto launches.

[Watch on X for gems](https://preview.redd.it/fx367v8lf2fe1.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f93999a3d2327e3253a42cef721749ac3de632)

# Telegram Communities:

* Join meme coin-specific groups.
* Look for coins that are **gaining traction fast** or being talked about repeatedly across multiple channels.

# Step 3: Verify the Hype

It’s easy to fall for a flashy coin with tons of buzz. But here’s how you filter out the scams:

**Check the Holders:** Use [Photon-Sol](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/@ma004) to analyze the top holders.

* Avoid coins where one wallet holds over 50% of the supply.
* Look for a healthy distribution among wallets
* Check the Data & Security - And Take in consideration the issues

[Verify the token](https://preview.redd.it/56n4t789g2fe1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c1353e6c2c60f46f1548706de8bc127a5d5b92d)

**Community Sentiment:**

* Are people excited about the project?
* Is the team transparent and active?

**Red Flags:**

* Promises of unrealistic returns.
* Anonymous teams without verified track records.

# Step 4: Photon-sol - Always the biggest gains in the space

[Photon Sol ](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/@ma004)— the number 1 Solana trading platforms. Built for degenerates, grinders, and anyone who sweats over slippage, this isn’t another clunky Telegram bot. Photon’s web-based interface is so fast, it’ll make Trojan and MaestroSniperBot look like they’re stuck in 2017.

**Why Photon Sol Stands Out**

* ⚡ **Web App Speed:** No Telegram bot lag. Instant trades, instant rage-quits.
* 🖱️ **One-Click Snipe/Sell:** Literally point, click, and pray. Perfect for when your hands shake during a 100x chase.
* 📊 **Live Pairs & Token Analytics:** Spot new launches and rug pulls in first seconds.
* 🔒 **Phantom Wallet Integration:** Your keys, your coins. No sketchy third-party access.

**How It Works (For Degens in a Hurry)**

1. Connect your Phantom wallet.
2. Set slippage/fee priority 
3. Trade, sell, repeat.

**But Wait, Is It Actually Faster?**  
Short answer: **Yes.** Photon’s architecture cuts out the middleman. No Telegram API delays, no waiting for bot replies. Just raw, unfiltered speed. Missed a moon? Blame your reflexes, not the platform.

[**Photon Sol**](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/@ma004) isn’t just another trading platform — it’s the speed demon of Solana trading. Designed for crypto traders who live and die by milliseconds, this tool delivers unprecedented speed for sniping, buying, and selling tokens.

Whether you’re a battle-tested degen or a crypto rookie, Photon Sol strips away complexity, turning lightning-fast trades into a point-and-click experience. No more missed opportunities or agonizing lag.

**Some examples of biggest wins in the space - Using Photon-Sol**

[Photon-sol x1000](https://preview.redd.it/2gesaergj2fe1.png?width=2076&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c47f1045daebfcb6a0d6ec5de8a4136e1437809)

# Step 5: Photon-sol - Get Started

Visit [https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/@ma004) and connect your Phantom wallet. After connecting and logging into Photon for the first time, you’ll see the welcome screen. Click the “Generate” button to create a new trading wallet. For security, Photon reveals your private key **ONLY ONCE** during setup—use the slider to uncover it. **WARNING:** Save this private key immediately in a secure location (e.g., password manager, offline storage) before clicking “Continue.”

[setup wallet on photon](https://preview.redd.it/9pv6dky1l2fe1.png?width=2370&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea57d515cb726e889e972063c66a9a95cb042387)

  
**Settings - Photon-Sol**

[settings for photon](https://preview.redd.it/4iz6etxvl2fe1.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a58ff0696d5330b03388621274fb753e583823)

**Quick buy/Quick Sell** This is where you'll be able to have full control over your trading experience For Buying and Selling, you have full control over the following settings: 

**Slippage:** how much more/less tokens you'll receive from a trade due to price volatility

Example of slippage: Suppose you wanted to buy a $XYZ at US$10.00. You place your order, but when it's confirmed, you realize that it got filled at a higher price of US$10.50.

This scenario is an example of negative slippage because you bought in at a higher price than you wanted to, which **decreases** your total buying power.

Conversely, positive slippage occurs when you place a buy order at US$10.00 but the order is confirmed at a price of US$9.50. The lower price thereby **increases** your purchasing power.

**Priority Fee:** This is the additional fee made to have your transaction completed faster. This fee is better known as a tip because it provides an economic incentive for Solana validators to confirm your transaction before others **Bribe:** This fee goes directly to the JITO validators to incentivize them to pick up and confirm your transactions. 

**Trading Presets:** You can set up to 3 different trading profiles (S1/S2/S3) to adjust your smart-mev protection, priority, bribe and slippage settings Once set up, from the buy menu on any token page, you'll be able to click on S1/S2/S3 to instantly switch between any one of your 3 trading presets, depending on the situation.

For **Auto-Buy** \- you can specify the % change in market cap for S1/S2/S3

For **Auto-Sell** \- you can specify the % change in market cap & the % of holdings you'd like to sell for S1/S2/S3

**Start Trading**

[trading with photon](https://preview.redd.it/aep6icncm2fe1.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=0775efc43a12726e35bea55385d6d12e271f9a2e)

Start trading with photon-sol is the easiest thing to do. After you created your wallet, made your settings and add your funds. You Just need to start trading.   
On the trade page - you have a huge chart and everything you need for a successful trade.

* 📊 **Live Chart Dominance**: A massive, uncluttered chart for plotting your next 1000x or catastrophic rug pull.
* 🔥 **Real-Time Transactions**: Watch buys/sells pop off like a live feed of degenerates chasing pumps.
* 💰 **“You’re Holding”**: Track your bags in real time—no more refreshing Dexscreener like a nervous rookie.
* 🏆 **Top Traders List**: See which whales/degens are riding the same token wave as you. Copy their moves (or avoid their mistakes).
* 🎯 **Holder Stats**: Instantly check what % of holders are diamond-handing vs. paperhanding. Spoiler: It’s mostly paperhands.
* ⏳ **Limit Orders**: Set Buy Dips, Stop Losses, and Take Profits without sweating over math. Let Photon’s automation do the work.
* 🕵️ **Dev Token Data**: Peek at the dev’s wallet. Are they holding? Dumping? This feature alone could save your portfolio.
* 🗺️ **Bubblemap**: An interactive map showing token holder distribution. Spot rugs *before* they yank the floor.

**Photon Sol** = Trading for geniuses, why would you make your life harder when this platform gives you everything on one screen?   
**Just → Connect wallet, set orders, and let the platform handle the rest.**

**On the right side you have everything you need - Buy - Sell and Data and Security**

[limit order with photon](https://preview.redd.it/mfc6rmrao2fe1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c97a47ea39fe5c04533d9deee84f2619240ee8)

Photon helps users automate trading and time their trades with three order types: **Buy Dip**, **Stop Loss**, and **Take Profit**. Let’s break them down.

**Buy Dip Orders**  
Set your target market cap using three methods:

1. **MC Drop by %**: Enter a percentage drop to trigger your buy order. Market cap and price update in real-time.
2. **Exact Market Cap**: Specify a fixed number—your order triggers when the token’s MC hits or drops below it.
3. **Target Line (Chart-Based)**: Drag a line on the chart to set your buy target visually, ideal for strategies based on resistance levels.

**Expiration Date**: Choose 24, 48, or 72 hours for the order to auto-cancel if not filled.

After clicking **“Create Order”**, details populate under the **Orders tab**, showing:

* Token, amount, condition
* Initial vs. target price/MC
* Trigger time, status, slippage, priority fee

**Key Notes**:

* If you set **Stop Loss** and **Take Profit** orders *both selling 100% of tokens*, the system auto-cancels the remaining order once one executes.
* **Priority Fee + Bribe**: Set these high enough to ensure your order is included early in the block (low fees = delayed execution).

**Stop Loss Orders**  
Configure using the same three methods (MC drop %, exact MC, or chart target line). Specify the **% of holdings to sell**, adjust settings, and finalize.

**Take Profit Orders**  
Set your target price/MC, choose the **sell amount** (partial or full), and confirm.

**Pro Tip**: Photon lets you tweak **priority fees and bribes** for *all* limit orders—critical for beating bots and sniping entries/exits. Don’t cheap out here if you want your orders to land first.

**DCA Orders**

[DCA on Photon](https://preview.redd.it/ue6f02y4q2fe1.png?width=315&format=png&auto=webp&s=857bbd310153b5411eed2cbbd8073cfc163ed5ae)

You can access DCA from any token page. Just click on the Orders tab, and choose DCA from the drop-down menu.

[DCA on Photon](https://preview.redd.it/9zw1eci6q2fe1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=52b7fed09f360b5d2d2bc54ec058fb9e86db1e4a)

To set up a Buy or Sell DCA order, you just need to fill in a few fields:

* the amount you wish to spend (in SOL)/sell (in %)
* how many minutes/hours in between each order
* the total # of orders you wish to have
* target range for the market cap (MIN/MAX)
* time to expiration for the order (24/48/72hrs)

You can also specify the priority and bribe amounts to use for each DCA order.

Similar to limit orders, you can manage all of your DCA orders in the same tab (click on the Orders tab, and choose DCA).

You'll be able to see your order details and also the status of the order and the created at time. If necessary, you can also click on the garbage icon to delete a DCA order.

[Memescope - Pump.Fun](https://preview.redd.it/tjr9nuhrq2fe1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=0631b9d4985e56065229e153caf618a07064e237)

  
The goal of Memescope is to give our traders even more flexibility in creating a fully-customized feed of all the metrics that they care about when deciding which tokens to buy into. Currently available are dashboards that show Pump.fun and Moonshot tokens. You can fully adjust all of the following filters to zero in on the things you care about:

* Top 10 holders
* Tokens with at least 1 social
* By progress to 100% bonding (prior to graduating/migrating to Raydium)
* Holders count
* Dev holding %
* Current liquidity
* Volume
* Market cap
* Transactions + Buys + Sells

Due to the nature of the fast-moving feed, we also have the hover-to-pause feature so you can select the token you'd like to buy and use the Quick buy button to enter a trade.

I might be getting surgery on cervical spine (neck) soon to remove bulging discs and fix my reversal of cervical lordosis I'm scared,ChronicPain,1i9fenk,2025-01-24 23:49:57,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1i9fenk/i_might_be_getting_surgery_on_cervical_spine_neck/,Unusual_Breath_2397,,"I just need reassurance tbh


So im 25, and I've had issues for the last 6 ish years and at first they said just loose weight it'll get better for I lost 3 st ... it got worse 
I did research present it to gp, they finally do mris and they say oh yeah it looks like this (I knew from the beginning 
Now 6 years later things r slowly moving forward (still no pain relief still told to move even tho i can't much but it's still progress ig)

As of rn these are all of the things I have wrong with me
Neck and Spine Conditions:

1. Degeneration of Cervical Intervertebral Discs

Affects: Neck (cervical spine) and can lead to referred pain in the shoulders and upper back.


2. Mild Thoracic Scoliosis (slight concave to the left)

Affects: Upper back (thoracic spine), causing postural changes.


3. Cervical Lordosis Reversal

Affects: Neck, leading to poor posture and possible strain on the cervical spine.


4. Moderate Stenosis at C5-C6 and C6-C7

Affects: Neck (cervical spine), and can cause mild pressure on the spinal cord with potential to affect nerve roots.


5. Sciatica

Affects: Lower back, hips, and legs. Pain runs down the sciatic nerve, typically on one side.


6. Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) at L4 and L5

Affects: Lower back (lumbar spine), causing potential pain, stiffness, and nerve compression.

8 Months post op- severe pain behind knee in active flexion still,ACL,1i9ejmp,2025-01-24 22:59:37,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1i9ejmp/8_months_post_op_severe_pain_behind_knee_in/,Adventurous-Chef847,,"I had ACL and meniscus repair 8 months ago (severe bucket handle tear, was NWB for 6 weeks post op)-

I'm definitely not at ""return to sport"" yet (acrobatics and dance); I can jog here and there and still building up quad strength to get it closer to matching my non-surgical leg, but quad strength is definitely decent even with that..

I have had bizarre pain behind my knee (medial, posterior) during any kind of active flexion that has been with me all 7 months since starting to weight bear post op.

I had an MRI a couple months ago, it showed that my meniscus was ""degenerative"" on the operated leg-- like, not great-- but not TORN in the way it was post-op: but they didn't see any obvious huge tears to take care of..

The surgeons are saying I could go under (surgery) AGAIN, for them to investigate and like ""clean up"" extra fragments of the meniscus, or..? I'm kind of confused. But they warned me having a 2nd surgical procedure could increase stiffness in the leg/risking loss of range of motion again, greater risk of arthritis in future...

It's just I would really like to be able to engage in active flexion without this sharp pain that hasn't improved for months, so it's hard for me to weigh pros against the risks.

Has anyone else experienced this? (Btw, I had a QUAD graft- not hamstring! So that doesn't explain, itself, this pain that is definitely behind the knee and medial)

I'm wondering if I should just keep waiting more months and try to see if as my muscles build up around the knee, that pain might ease? But it's already been 8 months and it hasn't gone away.. Any thoughts are welcome! I'm really on the fence about my options"

No clue what I did just started really hurting to the point where it hurt to swallow and i could not move my neck without shooting pain up the back of my head and down my right shoulder. Long story short, I went to my chiropractor/physical therapists office, they had me see their on site nurse practitioner, who sent me to the ER because they didn't like that I couldn't eat due to pain when swallowing. Got a CT and MRI cervical spine. Turns out I have degenerative disc disease, which is really common. That and two of the discs were pertruding into my spinal canal, one completly central and the other central/right (which is not so common). No cure for it but will need PT for the rest of my life basically.

Anyways, while doing the MRI, they found a nodule on my left thyroid. The doctor who explained my results to me told me it was small but to follow up with my Primary. Im thinking, okay, a small nodule like itty bitty... nope. 1.8 cm in diameter. Like the circumference of a size 7 to 7.5 ring. So I followed up with my Primary last week, got an ultrasound scheduled for earlier this evening after work. I didn't expect to get my results so fast, and I hate myself for looking at them. TI-RADS category 5 lesion. For people who don't speak medical (I sure as f*ck don't), that means a thyroid nodule that is highly suspicious for malignancy, with a greater than 80% chance of being cancerous.

I don't know what to do or what to think. My anxiety has skyrocketed. I think the whole thing with my back was my body's way of telling me, ""hey, there's something else going on"". I never would have known otherwise."

Honestly, I’m surprised I made it this far. 

When I was 10, I somehow got an aggressive form of MRSA (sepsis) in my right hip; osteomyelitis. After two surgeries to debride, and a pic line for IV antibiotics for six months, I was lucky to be alive, let alone still have my entire right leg. 

I was told as a kid that I would need a replacement somewhere down the line, they just didn’t know when, as it would depend on how I developed and my activity levels throughout the years. My entire life I’ve been accustomed to hip discomfort. MRSA did serious damage to the surface of my hip joint and femur, and had a feast on my cartilage. In the last year, discomfort has evolved to severe, constant pain. 

In August, I saw Ortho for hip pain. They conducted XRays, which showed a torn and frayed labrum. No surprise there. Ortho then sent me to a Hip Preservation Specialist, who ordered an Arthro MRI. The first MRI of my hip in twenty years. 

“MR Arthrogram Right hip from 10/11/24 shows: severe anterior to lateral labral degeneration. Anterior superior cartilage surface with significant heterogeneity and subchondral edema in acetabular weight bearing zone concerning for advanced arthritic change. Increased signal in the greater trochanter bursa and gluteal insertions.”

Fun. 

On 1/18 I had a “CT Hip Preservation Protocol” to evaluate the osseous spaces and surfaces of the anterior superior joint. I am still waiting for those results to be released to me. 

I saw an adjacent Ortho Specialist earlier this week, who noted “History, exam, imaging, and symptoms support FAJ DJD.” (Femoroacetabular degenerative joint disease)

Per new message from OG Preservation Specialist “re: preserving surgical options now vs hip replacement.  I am of the opinion that we have exhausted all preservation treatment modalities.”

I will be 35 at the end of March, and my gift is apparently turning into Bionic Woman. 
Happy Birthday to me.

I am always surprised that there isn't more conversation on people's thoughts about the *beginning* of the game- the little text-based intro section.

That part hit me like a ton of bricks and let me know that I was not embarking on a typical story. If not for that part, my expectations might have been skewed, but I feel like the writers brilliantly convey what this story will be about in just those opening few minutes of text. You already know how deeply Henry loves his wife, that he's prone to escapism (drinking in particular), and that his wife has a degenerative illness and requires care. The rest of the game is built on this foundation and beautifully addresses several aspects of human emotion in simple yet nuanced ways that force the player to reflect.

Maybe some of the people who've been disappointed by the ending were somehow disconnected or not engaged during these opening minutes?

What are y'alls thoughts on the opening? Am I in the minority for finding it so emotionally impactful? "
Help me uninstall Gamban for the love of god!,software,1i9bo6e,2025-01-24 20:24:40,0,0.29,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1i9bo6e/help_me_uninstall_gamban_for_the_love_of_god/,TheCream123,Looking for software :macOS: :Searching:,"Hi,

I am a profitable full time stocks, futures and crypto trader.

Last week I deposited a small sum to a crypto casino, lost it and got mad at myself for even trying it out.

Then I stumble upon Gamban software that prohibits you from accessing any internet casino, including bitcoin casinos. Without consideration I thought the software idea was great and installed it using the 7 day free trial period.

Then, all of a sudden my crypto trading wallets, sites and also VPN apps are suddenly disconnected. I start thinking ""what is happening, are they all under DDoS attack""?

No, of course, this f\*\*\*king Gamban app prohibits access to my CRYPTO WALLETS! I cannot any longer access my wallets and do my trading, buy or sell via my computer.

I've e-mailed Gamban but I cannot wait for their response. I have tried looking for a solution to get rid of this software via Reddit and YouTube, but there is not even ONE video or instruction on Google/Reddit/YouTube on how to get rid of it. How is that even possible?

I do not want to reinstall my whole computer. I've even read that that might not even work.

I think it's super shitty that you can install the app without them even giving a warning that you won't be able to access crypto sites or VPN.

I am so irritated right now. Luckily I was able to monitor and close some of my large positions through my phone.

Is there anyone that can help me? Is it the support that are the only ones that can help me? Will they even help me or will they think im a super degen gambler?

It feels like I've given away my computer to an hacker, honestly, and that I no longer have control over it.

I guess it will stop working in 7 days when the trial is over - but I didn't ask to not be able to work for a week..."

Deathless Necropolis Run - Right Side,ContestOfChampions,1i9adf7,2025-01-24 19:21:49,36,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContestOfChampions/comments/1i9adf7/deathless_necropolis_run_right_side/,Utspaz849,Informational,"When Deathless Thanos was released and people started speculating paths to go, I thought that a case could be made that their kits and synergies were tailor-made for fights and nodes on the right side path. I couldn't get the idea out of my head so I decided to make that my run for the Deathless Disciple challenge. Partially just to see if it could happen, partially out of masochism, partially cause it would give me something to work towards for a few weeks (my new goal is to finally pull a 7\* Hit-Monkey from the Titan if it kills me).

To start, I wanted to get the champs at the highest rank and sig I could muster, so by the time my run started, here was the spread:

* **Guillotine**: Rank 2, sig 20, 5\* Ghost Rider relic (Direct Damaging Effect Potency and Vicious runes)
* **King Groot**: Rank 3, sig 91, 6\* Thor Relic (Fury Buff Potency and Vigor runes)
* **Vision**: Rank 3, sig 30, 5\* Vision relic (both Heal Block duration runes)
* **She-Hulk**: Rank 3, sig 75, 5\* Hulk relic (Physical Resistance Down and Non-Hit Physical Damage runes)
* **Thanos**: Rank 3, unduped, 6\* Gamora relic (Fury/Cruelty Potency & Duration and Expertise runes)

I kept Guilly and Vision at lower sigs because I wasn't confident in Guilly's 10% chance to trigger the regen, and with the increase in furies Vision gets, the increased damage while Heal Blocked would amount to an extra 1 fury if I invested in him. I already had put sigs into KG earlier last year, so he had a head start, but I saw his regen and bonus incinerate duration as very valuable (spoiler: they were). She-Hulk I ended up investing most of the Deathless stones because I wanted her to have better odds for a few fights (which will be mentioned as I get to them).

The path I would take would be **Odin -> Shang-Chi** (reverse controls after special) and then **Stryfe -> Galan** (5-hit combo or else Untouchable). It just felt like all of these fights had counters, and it would be a solid challenge. Since I knew it would be quite tough, I practiced the feel of the reverse controls for a few days leading up to the run, which ended up helping a lot. But with that being said, onto the run:

* **Odin** \- As the first fight on the path, I gave myself a little mini-challenge while practicing and tried to get a solo on him with every character on the team. That was stupid. Guilly, Vision, and She-Hulk have to contend with his strong Armor buff, so they basically become reliant on crits to deal solid damage (granted, Guilly is like this anyway, which is why I was content with keeping her at r2. I'm not about that life). But over the course of practicing, I got the solo with Thanos, KG, and She-Hulk. I wanted the latter two at full health for other fights later, so I stuck with Thanos. I soloed him my first practice try, but took a lot of damage trying to full block his last sp2 hit to gain the Unstoppable. This time I didn't do that, and ended up having a far easier and healthier time. Stacking sp3 passive Corrosions makes for really solid damage, and if you want to dump your Necrotic Energy just use a sp2 and go back to sp3. For the trap node, just Counterpunch with your light attack to give your brain time to remember which swipe does what. Solo with Thanos.
* **Black Widow (Claire Voyant)** \- This fight looks really difficult, but turns out this was hilariously easy with She-Hulk. Not only did I solo this in practice with a rank 2, not only did I solo this in practice with a rank 3 at 7% health, but got another solo on the main run too. For me, the toughest part of the trap node is forgetting when the timer runs out or having the AI attack right as the timer expires, so you slip up and get whacked. Thanks to She-Hulk's Traumas, that almost never happens. Her Fear on the heavy attack counters the Unblockable and her sig makes that expire slower until BWCV gets to a sp1, where she'll immediately throw it and the cycle begins anew. One thing to watch for is that I found the AI to more than likely dash in after I knocked them down with my sp1, rather than throwing theirs. After they do they would throw the sp1, but that's important to remember if you lose the Fear and they get Death Touch. Solo with She-Hulk. After this fight, I ran into a Treasure Deadpooloid, and took him with KG for the next fight.
* **Shang-Chi** \- This is where the fights start to get tough. For a refresher, basically you have to perform SC's Wushu combos to give him charges, his sp1 removes one, his sp2 removes all (but refreshes them), and if he throws a special with 0 charges you take damage. I used KG for this one and stuck exclusively to M-M and M-L-L-M (Slow and Unblockable), while trying to counter his sp1 with a heavy to refresh his strikes. It was working very well until Phase 3, where by that point you can't do a Wushu combo you've already done or you take the node damage, and then you can't heavy-refresh anymore: you have to do all combos and end with the Stun one. This neutered my damage as I thought I had to do the Cleanse combo and remove my incinerate. There actually may be a better way to do this though. If you stick to the same 2 Wushu combos above and just push him to sp2, he'll refresh them and then rinse and repeat. I didn't think of that until it was too late, and I died when he was at 20%. I finished it off with Guilly. ""No revives used"", but the first Deathless death.
* **Squirrel Girl** \- Normally a pushover fight in non-Carina's Challenge content (at least for me because I exclusively used Onslaught on her), Dorreen now gets a good bit scarier when facing this team. If I wanted to I could've tried Vision, but I wanted to save him for the next fight so I ran in with Guilly. It was ok, ran into some heavy spacing issues trying to punish her sp2 and kept having times where I would knock her down just before her timer expires, so I end up getting like 7 Ruptures on me trying to knock her down again. I took her down 50%, and hate her ""Crit or Quit"" style. I tried using Thanos, but his passive heavy stun still counts for her node and she would gain Unstoppable, refusing to be knocked down. I took her down another 20% before going back to Guilly, apologizing for my mean words, and finishing the fight. My fingers were crossed the whole time though. 1 revive used.
* **Silver Centurion** \- The second (and only other) member of the ""NecropoliSC"" club (they'll workshop it later), and the first of two justifications for Vision's existence, but hoo boy does he prove it here. Thanks to the power burn on opponent's specials from Thanos' synergy, SC never threw a single sp2 throughout the course of the fight. It took me a little time to get comfortable parrying his sp1 drone beams for an opening, and I ate a heavy that happened to crit and shock me for half of my health (-\_-), but all-in-all it was a straightforward fight. Solo with Vision.
* **Spider-Man 2099** \- This was one of two fights that I was genuinely worried about going into the run. I decided to try Guilly first since her Degen wouldn't get mitigated by his Resistance Up passives. She ended up doing ok, but the nature of the fight and managing his Wither and Power Gain PLUS the reverse controls was just too much, and she only took out 20%. Then I threw in She-Hulk. Perfection. Thanos gives a nice gift in Rupture Immunity to her, so I only had to worry about the Power Gain and reverse controls. While yes her damage is entirely physical, Spidey's tankiness basically turns She-Hulk into a safer Guilly, needing crits to deal big bursts of damage. But when she did, they hit HARD. This was the only fight I got to 99 Traumas, and they pay off big-time when the stars align. This is also one of the fights that I wanted her at a good sig level for. At my level, once he had all 4 Special Concussion debuffs on him, he basically had -37% AA on specials. I found out that included his Power Gain if it triggered during it, and keeps you safe from Vulnerability if you get clipped. It took a very long time to do it, but She-Hulk took out the rest of the fight in that one try. This is unheard of for me: I have NEVER, not in the inital Necro runs nor the Carina Challenge runs before this, gotten past Spidey 2099 without using a revive or 10. This team is simply just made for Necropolis. ""No revives used"".
* **Sunspot** \- Also normally a pushover fight, this one is slightly more annoying due to everyone's relative need to throw specials (except Guilly, but I refuse to praise her). I tried using Vision to keep things under control, but the timing of everything got too out of hand and I only dealt 10% with him. Like last time, I threw in She-Hulk and she did the rest. Once you've thrown 2 sp3s (which I highly recommend in every She-Hulk fight), you aren't really obligated to throw specials so if you want you can just whack him until he goes down. Pretty straightforward, ""no revives used"".
* **Stryfe** \- Now we leave Reverse Controls Land and go into the next trap node, which I will refer to as ""Miss-tery Science Theater 3000"". I call it this because She-Hulk makes 90% of these fights a joke. Case in point: Stryfe. For starters, she counter both the Untouchable of the trap node and his own node with her Fear. Thanos donated a Grit buff to her Twitch stream so she can handle the Unstoppable on his node, and because of that you just have a really big, ACTUALLY EASIER THAN NORMAL Stryfe. I was gaining effects I didn't know I could gain, barely paid attention to the node, started daydreaming about what I would have for lunch, and put my brain on power-reserve mode, and by the time I came back to consciousness Stryfe was somehow both dead and crying at the same time. I didn't know when they added Betty Ross' Red She-Hulk in the game or why her model wasn't fully colored in, but I swore I saw her glare at me for a second and I'm too scared to question it. Solo with Red Dead She-Hulk.
* **Spot** \- Another fight made kinda trivial thanks to She-Hulk's kit and Thanos' simp-snap. Rupture immunity comes in clutch and Fear keeps Spot at bay. I didn't really focus on the Energize, as letting him get to sp2 made it easier to punish. Her sig also would occasionally cause that to fail as well, so it was just icing on the cake. Solo with She-Hulk.
* **Galan** \- I revived Guilly for this fight, as this was basically the ONLY fight that justified her existence. Thanos apparently likes a diversified portfolio because he gave Guilly a 150% Neutralize on her sp1. Even with the Nullify that Galan is immune to, this became a very straightforward fight. The Neutralize makes his Phase 3 50% AA increase into nothing and the Nullify punishment never came into play because of it. Due to her being rank 2 and possibly also due to throwing about 6 crits every calendar year, he got to the second phase of the Necro timer at about 20%. That made things a lot tougher, but fair is fair, her regen actually came in clutch a good few times and kept her at high health the whole time. I think I might start gambling. Solo with Guilly.
* **Sandman** \- Back to the adventures of Hulk Topic and the Beach Boy. This actually was the hardest out of her 3 fights so far because her Traumas aren't paused during opponents' specials. Because of this, even after the max Debilitate, Sandman's sp1 would knock off 25% of their duration before I could even land a hit. This, mixed with some poor timing on keeping up the Fear, led to me almost losing my Traumas for the first time in the run. Thankfully her Grit came into play again, allowing her to attack while he is Unstable and find openings. A little scary, but still a Solo with She-Hulk.
* **Spider-Man Supreme** \- This is a fight I didn't think would be *bad*, just *annoying*. I knew She-Hulk could keep the Miss under control, but no champions had good access to buffs without causing Spidey to ramp up to obscene levels. I stuck to the corner, dexing, parrying, heavying, repeating. Got him 50% before the second Necro phase made him meaner and I got spell-clapped. Went back with her to try being more aggressive and off-the-wall, doing shallow intercepts with light attacks to maximize time before the phase change, but didn't really feel a difference except more punches to the face and 8 less percent done to him. Revived again and finished it up. Not terrible, but yeah still annoying. 2 revives.
* **Knull** \- Ok, THIS is the second fight I was worried about. The ""contact = pain"" node is truly awful, and I have hated this fight every single time I've done it. This is probably the best I've done on it and I still hate it. No real character is great for this, so I decided to take Guilly in after she surprised me with Galan. Having to work around the trap node with this fight is very difficult, especially since it feels like the AI is more prone to blocking and not dashing in (probably a conscious effort by the devs to not have him rush you and knock off half of your health, but still kinda dumb). An interesting bug(?) I found at this point was that if you don't have the Untouchable combo timer up and you throw a special, those hits will basically bank until your next basic combo, so you'll start at 2 or 3 in Guilly's case. I have no idea if that was intended, but it helped a good few times when I wanted to get Knull just under his sp1. Alas, I was out of health potions at this point and Guilly's regen can only do so much (at the sig I left her at, which is still her fault somehow), and she got him down 40% before the second Necro phase and I mistimed a parry on his sp1 and exploded. Still her fault. At this point I had revives in the overflow and wanted to just throw crap at the wall, I revived Thanos twice (forgot he was a playable character at this point) and tried but couldn't manage much out of his need to block for the Counterpunch. I revived She-Hulk, but I couldn't find good avenues to apply the Fear without parrying and taking the node damage so she only did ok. Finally I went back begrudgingly to Guilly and finished the last 20% with her. This honestly could qualify as the second fight to justify her existence, and a reason to make her a rank 3 (which would help her crit chance too). 4 revives.
* **Shocker** \- I still had a Deadpooloid charge on KG from earlier, and I knew that Thanos' loving Undermine buff on specials would keep Shocker's auto-block at bay, so I revived him for this. I was pretty much right. The healing was the MVP here, as I played pretty sloppy throughout. But an ugly solo is still a solo in the eyes of Kabam. Solo with KG, but needed to revive him at the start.
* **Deathless Grandmaster** \- The final fight of the path, so I didn't really plan this as I wanted my thumbs to feel fresh air today. I took KG for the first phase, but I realized that most of the Deathless have very easy access to GM's commands in Phase 2. That's great if its Grandmaster Says, but when its not that's a one-way ticket to the back corner. For some reason at this point the GM AI thought that he had the Slashed Tires node on him, because he didn't dash back a single time during that. The pressure got too much and he knocked me out. Ran in with Guilly, and the same thing happened. Thinking about it outside of the fight, Thanos probably would be great here due to his easy knockdown and buffs on sp1, but again I kinda forgot to use him for some reason. I revived KG and thanks to some better luck on prompts, got him down to his last phase before dying as expected. The time on the Reverse controls path (plus a lot of time Corrupted vs Knull -\_-) made me very comfortable with reverse controls during Phase 3, so that's pretty neat. I revived Vision to give his Phase 4 two phasing middle fingers, and the run is done! 2 revives used. 

**TOTAL REVIVES USED: 11**

I really think there were devs who intended these paths to be taken by someone, because I found a callout that I had never seen before (forgive me if its not) between She-Hulk and multiple opponents on the Miss path:

Opponent: I am only solid when I choose to.

She-Hulk: Who says I want you solid??

Opponent: FILTHY WITCH!!

  
Looking back I could've absolutely made the revive counter single digits by not just trying certain characters at the start of fights and instead going with who I thought would be best for it, but this was never really about doing it itemless - it was about seeing how well they could actually handle it at all. Things like this are why I love this game. Getting to challenge youself, set a goal to strive towards, and see it through with both good and bad surprises along the way. And now I have a duped Maestro so I can make people hate me in BGs. Tee hee.

I hope y'all enjoyed this fight breakdown, and I'll happily answer any questions (as much as I can remember) in the comments!"

Hi all – I have been dealing with some mystery symptoms involving paresthesia and neuropathy since August 2024. My doctors have not found a root cause after numerous tests, and I am just stumped. Not looking for diagnosis, just any advice.

**Medical history:** 31 male. 5’10, 175 - 180 lbs. History of depression and anxiety. High cholesterol and high blood pressure. Gilbert’s Syndrome.

**Surgeries:** Wisdom teeth removal (2018) and Septoplasty/turbinate reduction (2023)

**Current Medication:** Citalopram 40 mg (currently tapering off and switching to 20mg Prozac). Atorvastatin 20 mg (currently doing a trial hold for 3 months as recommended by Neurologist to see if that improves symptoms). Just started Propranolol 10 mg as needed for anxiety and tension headaches (prescribed by Psychiatrist). Hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety/dizziness.

**Current vitamins:** Men’s One A Day Multivitamin, Vitamin D3, COQ10, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Calm magnesium powder and Force Factor Smarter Greens chews.

The last several months have been a lot so I will try to condense this timeline as much as possible.

 

**Beginning Symptoms (August 2024):** Paresthesia in arms/hands, back of neck/upper back and side of right face. Progressed to burning. Itchy legs and periodic numb feet. Some nausea/dizziness.

 

**Tests (conducted August 2024):**

CT Brain: normal

CT of neck: normal

MRI Brain: normal

MRI neck: Minor straightening of lordosis and mid to lower cervical degenerative disc disease.

CMP/CBC – nl

TSH - nl

Sedimentation Rate-Westergren – 2

ANA – negative

B12/Folate – 698/18.8

 

**Symptoms (September 2024 – present):** Abnormal nerve sensations throughout body (burning, tingling, wetness, coolness, itching). Felt bilaterally – arms/hands/legs/feet/groin/butt. No visible swelling. Scalp sensitivity and face tingling. Back burning. Daily tension headaches. All pain and sensations wax and wane/move around. Increase in dark eye floaters in both eyes. Eye strain/occasional soreness. Periodic dizziness, nausea and muscle twitches. 

**Symptoms that I’ve had but have improved:** Insomnia, night sweats, ear pressure/tinnitus, malaise, loss of appetite, brain fog.

 

**Tests conducted (October – December 2024):**

CT of T-Spine (Oct 2024)– nl

CT of L-Spine (Oct 2024) – nl

MRI of T-Spine (Nov 2024) – nl

MRI of L-Spine (Nov 2024) - Mild arthrosis at L5-S1 and with some bulging discs. No central canal stenosis noted.

Optometrist (Nov 2024) – Normal eye exam. Prescription changed slightly. Retinal images taken of both eyes. No evidence of inflammation or explanation of floaters. Chalked up to aging changes.

EMG/NCS of upper extremities & lower extremities (Nov/Dec 2024) – normal results

Skin biopsy for Small Fiber Neuropathy (taken from foot and thigh) (Dec 2024) – normal results

 

**Blood Tests (conducted October 2024 – January 2025):**

CMP/CBC – nl

TSH - nl

Sedimentation Rate-Westergren – 4

ANA – negative

A1C – 5.2

B12/Folate – 624/13.6

Vitamin B12/Folate – 624/13.6

Vitamin D – 36.5

Vitamin B6 – 32

Copper – 92

CK, Total – 156

Carbon Monoxide – 3

 

**What has helped:** Nerve pain almost disappears with exercise. A Depakote burst and now Propranolol helps with the tension headaches. Hydroxycine and really any antihistamine helps with nausea and dizziness. Trazodone helped inconsistently with insomnia issues, have since stopped taking and do not need it. Adequate sleep and hot showers. 

**What has not helped:** Medrol pack and muscle relaxers. OTC pain meds help inconsistently with headaches, but my Neurologist believed they were giving me rebound headaches, so I use sparingly now.

Doctors currently do not want to repeat any imaging or tests, and I have follow ups with PCP and Neurologist in 3 months. Any input would be appreciated!"

Ricky character changes and implications for the show,ridethecyclone,1i959v8,2025-01-24 15:34:50,9,0.8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ridethecyclone/comments/1i959v8/ricky_character_changes_and_implications_for_the/,Throwawayaenobarbus,Discussion,"I want to start this by saying I am not firmly in either school of thought, as I think there's merit to both sides.

With the changes to Ricky's character from/following the run with Yannick, I feel like RTC will never please everyone. Is one option/version objectively better than the other?

I understand the outrage about the changes. Making the character no longer have a degenerative disease and instead having just the traumatic mutism feels like it cheapens his story arc. His transformation from quiet-but-still-able-to-play-the-tambourine guy to cat sex god just feels less meaningful than that of the boy who also couldn't experience movement and play the same way kids around him could. His decision to concede also felt like such an important moment for the whole show, the first moment that we realize not every character feels like they need to go back. I also recognize that representation for disabled folks in musical theater comes quite rarely, and that means a lot of people were rightfully hurt to lose a piece of that representation.

On the other hand, the original writing makes it difficult to cast disabled actors to play the character, or any other character in the show for that matter. The premise is that in the afterlife, disabilities are shed completely. By writing a character who was disabled in life, but isn't in death, doesn't that make it unnecessarily difficult for any theater group to cast a Ricky actor who is wheelchair-bound, or a Constance who uses mobility aids, or a Noel who is hearing-impaired, or an Ocean who has a speech impediment? The show implies that in the afterlife no one has has the disabilities they bore in life. Any casting of disabled actors directly conflicts with that information that was (and still is) core to Ricky's story/the story at large.

By rewriting the character to not have transformed from being physically disabled to no longer needing his aids, they are opening the door for a disabled actor/actress play any role. Is that not more of an opportunity for casts with diverse backgrounds and abilities? Is the concern more so that even though the casting now COULD accommodate any number of actors with disabilities more easily, that casting directors for shows will continue to overlook auditioners with disabilities?

I appreciate you reading this and hope you'll share your thoughts.

Edit: I meant to say, but forgot until I was reminded by a commenter that I wanted to say so. I say all of this above as a white, hetero, neurotypical, cis male who does not have any disabilities. A large part of asking the questions I pose above is that I don't think I have any authority on the subject. That said, I haven't seen anyone talk about this, and was curious if this is a thought process anyone has had and whether people who do have experience/authority/skin in the game think that any of this is valid."
"Seeking Advice on Scoliosis, Degenerative Disc Disease, and Facet Joint Degeneration – Minimally Invasive Surgery vs. Long-Term Management",Biohackers,1i94vnm,2025-01-24 15:17:44,3,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1i94vnm/seeking_advice_on_scoliosis_degenerative_disc/,ITMAN542,💬 Discussion,"Hey everyone,

(26m) I’m looking for **second opinions and advice** regarding my spinal conditions and potential **minimally invasive surgery options**. I've been struggling with **chronic back pain, scoliosis, and degenerative changes** in my spine **for 8 years**, and I’m at a crossroads about whether to pursue surgery or continue conservative treatment.

# 📌 My Diagnosed Conditions & Imaging Findings:

I recently had **multiple MRIs, X-rays, and a SPECT CT scan**, and here’s a summary of my findings:

# 1️⃣ Cervical Spine (Neck) Issues

* **Mild degenerative disc disease (C5-6, C6-7)** – Likely causing **stiffness and localized pain**.
* **No fractures or instability** were found.

# 2️⃣ Thoracic Spine (Upper/Mid-Back) Issues

* **Degenerative disc disease at T11-12** – Not currently causing nerve compression, but likely contributing to **chronic mid-back pain**.
* **Facet joint degeneration at T7-8, T8-9** – **Confirmed by increased radiotracer uptake on SPECT CT**, indicating **arthritis-like degeneration in these joints**.
* **Thoracolumbar S-shaped scoliosis** – No instability, but the curve may be worsening **disc and facet joint wear**.

# 3️⃣ Lumbar Spine (Lower Back) Issues

* **Mild spondylosis (T12-L1)** – Early signs of **spinal wear and tear**.
* **Mild lumbar radiculopathy** – No major nerve compression, but there is **irritation in the lumbar region**.

# ⚡ Symptoms & Impact on My Life

* **Daily pain ranging from mild to severe (8-10 on bad days)**, limiting my ability to sit, exercise, or even go out for long periods.
* **Pain is worse with movement**, especially twisting, bending, or arching my back.
* **I have no significant numbness, tingling, or weakness** in my arms or legs, meaning nerve compression isn’t the main issue right now.
* I was a **bodybuilder and powerlifter**, so I’ve always focused on **fixing biomechanics and improving posture** before considering surgery.

# 🏥 Treatments I’ve Tried

* **Physical Therapy & Postural Therapy:** 1.5 years of PT 4-6x a week 45-1hr daily routines. Helped for a while but eventually led to diminishing returns.
* **PRP Injections (2020):** Had **no improvement** in pain.
* **Celebrex (NSAID):** Helps with inflammation but isn’t a long-term solution.
* **Orthopedic Surgeon Recommended RFA (Radiofrequency Ablation) at T7-8, T8-9:**
   * I’m hesitant because it **feels like putting WD-40 on a squeaky wheel bearing** instead of fixing the actual issue.

# 🩺 Questions & What I’m Looking For

I want to hear from people who have had **similar conditions** and what has worked for them. Specifically:

1. **Minimally Invasive Surgery:**
   * Has anyone had **Vertebral Body Tethering (VBT), Anterior Scoliosis Correction (ASC), or Minimally Invasive Fusion (MIS-TLIF or XLIF)?**
   * Were you happy with the results? Did it relieve pain or improve function?
   * How was your recovery experience?
2. **Pain Management Options:**
   * Is **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) for facet joint pain worth it**, or should I consider a more structural fix?
   * Has anyone tried **stem cell therapy for degenerative disc disease**? If so, did it actually work? scared about the $20,000 it would take.
3. **Scoliosis-Specific Advice:**
   * If you had **progressing scoliosis with degenerative disc disease**, at what point did you decide on surgery?
   * Have you found **non-surgical ways** to slow down curve progression and relieve pain?

# 🔗 Additional Info

* I have **all my imaging files, radiology reports, and impressions compiled** in case anyone wants to take a closer look. [https://we.tl/t-GQDvUE13Fj](https://we.tl/t-GQDvUE13Fj)
* I’d appreciate **any insights, personal experiences, or advice from others who have gone through similar situations**.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Thanks in advance. 🙏

(26m) I’m looking for **second opinions and advice** regarding my spinal conditions and potential **minimally invasive surgery options**. I've been struggling with **chronic back pain, scoliosis, and degenerative changes** in my spine **for 8 years**, and I’m at a crossroads about whether to pursue surgery or continue conservative treatment.

# 📌 My Diagnosed Conditions & Imaging Findings:

I recently had **multiple MRIs, X-rays, and a SPECT CT scan**, and here’s a summary of my findings:

# 1️⃣ Cervical Spine (Neck) Issues

* **Mild degenerative disc disease (C5-6, C6-7)** – Likely causing **stiffness and localized pain**.
* **No fractures or instability** were found.

# 2️⃣ Thoracic Spine (Upper/Mid-Back) Issues

* **Degenerative disc disease at T11-12** – Not currently causing nerve compression, but likely contributing to **chronic mid-back pain**.
* **Facet joint degeneration at T7-8, T8-9** – **Confirmed by increased radiotracer uptake on SPECT CT**, indicating **arthritis-like degeneration in these joints**.
* **Thoracolumbar S-shaped scoliosis** – No instability, but the curve may be worsening **disc and facet joint wear**.

# 3️⃣ Lumbar Spine (Lower Back) Issues

* **Mild spondylosis (T12-L1)** – Early signs of **spinal wear and tear**.
* **Mild lumbar radiculopathy** – No major nerve compression, but there is **irritation in the lumbar region**.

# ⚡ Symptoms & Impact on My Life

* **Daily pain ranging from mild to severe (8-10 on bad days)**, limiting my ability to sit, exercise, or even go out for long periods.
* **Pain is worse with movement**, especially twisting, bending, or arching my back.
* **I have no significant numbness, tingling, or weakness** in my arms or legs, meaning nerve compression isn’t the main issue right now.
* I was a **bodybuilder and powerlifter**, so I’ve always focused on **fixing biomechanics and improving posture** before considering surgery.

How to advocate for an increase without looking like you’re an addict.,ChronicPain,1i94h78,2025-01-24 15:00:48,26,0.94,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1i94h78/how_to_advocate_for_an_increase_without_looking/,Kuzik1123,,"I have severe degenerative arthritis in both knees and use a cane to walk. I’ve been on the same rx for over 18 months now (hydrocodone 5/325). The medicine is nowhere near as helpful as it once was. All I’ve asked the doc to do is increase the pill from 3/day to 4/day since I can’t sleep through the night because of the pain in my knees.
Doc doesn’t want to increase RX because of risk of addiction. 
I’ve complied with every hurdle they’ve asked of me. I never call between refills begging to be seen or anything like that. Urine tests have been 100% in accordance with their policy.
I’m trying to lose weight so I can have my knee replaced, but it’s very difficult to exercise in this condition without worsening the pain. What do I do?"

""Stretch arms out wide. Gently flap, like butterfly. This very relaxing."" The other students flapped their arms, despite how strange Gonta's lesson was. Tenko did the same, as well, trying to focus on relaxing, and not on the pain in her head or her sides. She felt that the more she flapped, however, the more tired she grew.





   ""Can we do something else, now?"" she called out. ""Something less...'flappy?'""





   ""Shhh...must be silent and patient, like praying mantis,"" Gonta replied, putting his finger up to his lips. ""Now, class, you've been busy, like bee, all day, so imagine you are different bug. Imagine you are pillbug.""





   ""Pillbug? What is that, Gonta?"" Nagito asked as he flapped.





   ""Hmm...you know it better as 'roly-poly,'"" Gonta replied. The others nodded in response. ""Now, imagine you are roly-poly. Curl up into ball. No feel tense anymore, right?""





   ""I feel...weird,"" Kazuichi admitted, holding his legs close to his chest.





   ""Nyahaha! I feel *delightful!* "" Angie said, rolling around on her mat. Tenko felt the pain in her sides grow more intense. All Gonta's exercises did was make her feel worse, it seemed. She feared that no matter what she did, the pain would always keep coming back. She stood up.  





""Um...this isn't helping me,"" she said. ""I'm leaving.""





""No can leave,"" Gonta replied in between deep breaths. ""You must stay and rela-""





   ""I SAID I'M LEAVING!!"" Tenko shouted.





   ""Okay! Okay! Tenko can leave!"" Gonta said, holding his hands up in defense. Tenko hurried home to discover Kokichi and Himiko in the living room watching TV. Kokichi was lying in Himiko's arms while Himiko rubbed his belly.





   ""H-Himiko?! I thought you said you and Kokichi were going to the ice cream parlor!"" she said.





   ""Nyeh...we were about to, but Kokichi said he had a tummyache,"" Himiko said. ""So we decided to stay home.""





   ""Why are you home so early?"" Kokichi asked, clearly not anticipating Tenko's early return. 





   ""You have no business questioning me, you...you..."" Tenko paused to turn away as the pain came back. ""I...just thought it'd be better to get those lessons from Himiko. Himiko, can you please teach me the art of sleeping, now?""





   ""Well...okay. If it's really that important to you,"" Himiko replied. ""Nyeh, Kokichi?"" Kokichi rolled his eyes and sighed, sitting up to let Himiko stand up.





   ""Fiiiine..."" he pouted.





   ""Nyeh...I'll be back soon, Panta Bear. I promise,"" Himiko said.





   ""Okaaay..."" Kokichi huffed in response, plopping his cheek into the palm of his hand. Himiko gave him a kiss on his forehead before walking with Tenko up to their room. 





   ""Nyeh, okay, Tenko, are you ready?""





   ""Always ready for you, Himiko!"" Tenko said, trying to contain her excitement. 





   ""Ahem..."" Himiko said, crossing her arms.





   ""Oh!"" Tenko slouched her shoulders and gave Himiko a half-lidded gaze. ""Nyeh...I'm ready.""





   ""Better! Okay, the trick to getting good sleep is setting the mood,"" Himiko said. ""It's best to make the entire room dark, and surround yourself with your favorite stuffed animals so they can help you through your nightmares. It also helps to avoid liquids so your bladder doesn't interrupt your sleep, and, if you want, you can light a candle with your favorite scent.""





   ""Nyeh...you're really smart, Himiko. This is why you're the best,"" Tenko said calmly. 





   ""No, I just enjoy sleeping, so I know a lot about it,"" Himiko said. ""Now, the most important thing is having a comfortable bed. So, get in bed."" Tenko went over to Himiko's bed and lifted up the covers. ""Not my bed!! *Your* bed!!""





   ""Oh...right,"" Tenko said, then headed to her own bed and slipped inside. Himiko tucked her in, making sure she was comfortable.





   ""Nyeh...are you comfortable?""





   ""Yup,"" Tenko said, blushing.





   ""Stop blushing! You're making things weird!""





   ""Sorry,"" Tenko said.





   ""Now, close your eyes, and let yourself be enveloped by the warmth of your blanket,"" Himiko said. ""Let all your feelings go. They don't matter. Only sleep matters. Only sleep.""





   ""That's...kinda depressing, Himiko,"" Tenko said.





   ""Don't think! Just...take a deep breath...and sleep..."" Himiko said. ""Forget about everything. Forget about the world. Forget about your day at school. Forget about your worries. Forget about-""





   ""AUGHH!!"" Tenko cried out suddenly. She bent in the fetal position, holding her sides. ""No! Please! Not again!!"" Himiko sighed and rolled her eyes.





   ""Nyeh...Tenko, take painkillers already!"" she said.





   ""I...can't!"" Tenko said, looking up at Himiko tears in her eyes.





   ""Why not?""





   ""Because...painkillers won't stop what's happening to me!""





   ""Yes, it will! You take them all the time!""





   ""You don't understand, Himiko!"" Tenko cried, throwing her blanket off of her. ""I...didn't want to tell you this because I didn't want you to worry about me, but..."" She paused to lower her voice. ""...I have...*genkicitis*."" Himiko narrowed her eyes in confusion at her.





   ""Nyeh...you have *what?* ""





   ""Genkicitis!"" Tenko repeated. ""It affects people with high energy, like me! Lately, I've been having headaches, pain in my sides, and feeling sleepier than usual! And, sometimes, I feel hot when it's not even that hot! I even saw red spots before my eyes!""





   ""Tenko, who told you about this 'genkicitis,' or whatever?"" Himiko asked, crossing her arms.





   ""Kokichi,"" Tenko answered. Himiko's eyes bugged out of her skull.





   *I* knew *there was a reason I pictured a halo over that guy's head!* she thought to herself. ""Tenko, genkicitis isn't a real thing! You're PMSing! This happens to you *every month!* "" Tenko sat in thought.





   ""Oh, yeah...you're right! It does!"" she said. 





   ""How do you forget your own PMS symptoms?!""



 

   ""Well...I'm sorry, okay?! I'm so busy with neo-aikido and a bunch of other stuff that I forget that I bleed every month! But...if that's what's happening to me, w-what about the red spots?""





   ""Nyeh...how did you see the red spots?"" Himiko asked.





   ""Well, Kokichi told me to close my eyes, and when I opened them, I saw red spots before my eyes!""





   ""And have you seen them ever since?"" Himiko asked.





   ""Well...no,"" Tenko replied sheepishly. 





   ""Because Kokichi made you wear glasses with red spots on them!"" Himiko said, rolling her eyes. ""Nyeh...he watches *way* too much Looney Tunes that he's turning into one! Who does he think he is, *Bugs Bunny?!* ""





   ""You mean...he lied to me?!"" Tenko cried, growing angry.





   ""Are you surprised?"" Himiko asked flatly. 





   ""Well...no, but, yes at the same time!"" Tenko said. ""He seemed so serious!""





   ""Yeah, that's he wants you to think!"" Himiko said. *Just like what he said to me earlier, that stinkin' liar! I should have known something was up! I bet he also lied about that stomachache! That jerk!*





   ""Grrr...wait until I get my hands on that little-"" Tenko began.





   ""Nyeh...you're not doing anything,"" Himiko interrupted. ""I'll deal with him."" She then rushed downstairs to the living room. 





**End**





 ""Nyeh...Kokichi, could you come here?"" Himiko said as she entered the living room. Kokichi jumped up from the couch. 



 

  ""Are you done teaching Tenko the 'art of sleeping?'"" he asked. Himiko swayed her shoulders flirtatiously at him.





   ""Mm-hmmm..."" she said. ""Now we have some time to ourselves."" Kokichi raised his eyebrows in delight. 





   ""Ooo, I like where this is going, Monkey Buns,"" he murmured, wrapping his arms around her. Himiko batted her eyelashes at him.





   ""Can we go to your room?"" she asked softly. 





   ""Hell, yeah,"" Kokichi murmured in response. 



 

  ""Nyeh...follow meee,"" Himiko sang in a seductive voice as she grabbed a hold of Kokichi's scarf and pulled him along to Kokichi and Gonta's room. She closed the door behind them, then pressed herself against Kokichi.





   ""What's gotten into you all of a sudden?"" Kokichi asked with an amused grin. 





   ""Just wanted some privacy,"" Himiko replied, choosing her words carefully so Kokichi wouldn't detect any lies from her. It was true that she wanted some privacy, after all. She pressed her forehead against his. ""I want you, Kokichi, to pick me up.""





   ""Oh, shit, Himiko..."" Kokichi murmured, his cheeks turning pink. He wrapped his arms around her and hoisted her onto him. 





   ""Nyeh...now, put me down onto your bed,"" Himiko said in a sultry whisper, cupping his face into her hands. A naughty grin crossed Kokichi's face. 





   ""Normally, I'd try to talk you out of this, but...you're actually really good at this whole seductive thing, Himiko!"" he said. ""You're making it hard to resist you.""





   ""I'm sure I'm making *something* hard,"" Himiko replied, giving Kokichi a small kiss on his lips. Kokichi's cheeks reddened.





   ""Dayum, girl!"" he said, biting his lip with an impish twinkle in his eye. He walked over to his bed and placed Himiko onto it, then hovered over her. ""What next, babe?"" Himiko pulled Kokichi's scarf, lowering Kokichi's face closer to hers.





   ""Now, I want you to tell me..."" she began.



 

  ""Yeah...?"" Kokichi asked, his grin growing wider. 





   ""...why you TOLD TENKO SHE HAD 'GENKICITIS,' Mister 'iF-i-hAd-sOmEtHiNg-tO-dO-wItH-iT-i'D-tElL-yOu-bEcAuSe-wE'rE-pArTnErS-iN-cRiMe!!'"" Himiko exclaimed. Kokichi scoffed and rolled his eyes, getting off his bed. 





   ""Crap,"" he muttered. 





   ""Start talking, Kokichi!"" Himiko demanded. 





   ""Okay, okay! I told her she had a fake disease to get her to shut up and leave us alone because she was really getting on my nerves, okay?!"" Kokichi said. ""I mean, geez, I can't go anywhere without her always watching me and saying 'dEgEnErAtE mAlE' this and 'dEgEnErAtE mAlE' that! Urrghh!! It was *so* annoying!! You can't tell me that whole thing with the sandwich didn't annoy you!""





   ""Nyeh...it did!"" Himiko said. ""But, Kokichi, you shouldn't tell her that has a fake disease! Besides, you promised me during my Supreme Lady training that you wouldn't prank Tenko, Angie, and Tsumugi! They're off limits, remember?""





   ""Yeah, yeah, I remember,"" Kokichi said, waving his hand dismissively. ""I'm sorry, Himiko, okay? I'm sorry I lied to you. I just...want to spend time with you without hearing Tenko's constant squawking about how she hates guys! We all get it! She hates guys! I wish she'd go bother someone else! I'm starting to understand why *you* get so frustrated with her!"" Himiko crossed her arms, standing in her Supreme Lady position.





   ""Nyeh...although I agree, *I'm* not the one you should be apologizing to,"" she said. Kokichi stared at her in baffled silence.





   ""You're not going to make me apologize to her?!"" he said.





""It's either that, or I hex you,"" Himiko said. ""Because, believe me, I'm very much thinking about it. Now, you go march your butt upstairs and go tell Tenko you're sorry!""





   ""I will *gladly* take the hex!"" Kokichi said.





   ""NOW, KOKICHI!!"" Himiko ordered, pointing at the door. ""If you really love me like you say you do, go apologize to Tenko!"" Kokichi sighed in frustration, rubbing his neck and glaring at Himiko. 





   ""Fine,"" he muttered reluctantly through gritted teeth. ""But, I'm only doing this *because* I love you, not because I feel bad for what I did, 'cuz I really don't."" Himiko crossed her arms at him as he walked past her and out of his room. She followed him up to her and Tenko's room. Once Tenko saw Kokichi, she jumped out of bed at him.





   ""You lied to me!"" she snapped. Kokichi rolled his eyes.





   ""Yeah, what else is new, ding-a-ling?"" he grumbled sarcastically. 





   ""Himiko, can I throw him?"" Tenko asked. Kokichi looked at Himiko in alarm.





   ""No,"" Himiko answered. Kokichi sighed in relief. ""He came up here for one thing. Well, Kokichi?"" Kokichi sighed heavily before facing Tenko. He opened his mouth to speak, but no sound came out. He turned back to Himiko.





   ""Actually...I'm okay with her throwing me,"" he said.



 

  ""KOKICHI OUMA, YOU BETTER DO IT!!"" Himiko said, shooting Kokichi a warning look.





   ""Alright! Alright! I'm doing it! Just keep your pantyhose on, woman!"" Kokichi cried. He turned to Tenko. ""Tenko...I'm s-s-soorryyy...that I lied to you."" He shuddered violently afterwards.





   ""I *don't* forgive you!"" Tenko spat. ""Not only are you a degenerate male, you're the worst kind of degenerate male there is: a liar!""





   ""Yeah, 'cuz lying is *way* worse than murdering someone,"" Kokichi muttered, rolling his eyes.





   ""Because of you, I thought I was going to die!"" Tenko cried. Kokichi narrowed his eyes at her.





   ""So, it's *my* fault you're too dumb to remember that you have a period?"" he asked. ""How do you love girls so much but forget that you *are* one?!""





   ""Himiko! He called me dumb!"" Tenko said. Himiko rolled her eyes.





   ""Nyeeeh...I've had enough!!"" she exclaimed in frustration. She turned to Kokichi. ""You! No more pranking Tenko, especially if it involves lying to her about having a disease!"" She then turned to Tenko. ""And, you! No more bothering Kokichi and calling him a degenerate male! If you two don't cut it out and leave each other alone, I will get Gonta to conk your heads together!! Now, make up, or else!!""





   ""Fiiine..."" Kokichi and Tenko muttered, sticking their hands out to each other and shaking them. Tenko yanked her hand back and shook it, sticking her tongue out in disgust.





   ""Yecchh!! I can't believe I just shook hands with a degen-""





   ""TENKO!!"" Himiko screeched. 





   ""Sorry! I'm sorry!"" Tenko cried. Himiko turned to Kokichi. 





   ""Go back downstairs!"" she ordered. Kokichi rolled his eyes and sighed, trudging out of Himiko and Tenko's room. She then turned to Tenko. ""And, you, go to bed!""





   ""B-But, it's not even six-"" Tenko began. 





   ""NOW!! I've had it with both of you!"" Himiko interrupted. Tenko scrambled into bed and immediately fell asleep. Himiko sighed with relief as she massaged her temples. ""Nyeh...I need a cold one."" She then headed downstairs and grabbed herself a strawberry Panta. "

for some reason, Tsunaed caves in the pressure from teh council and boots Naruto out of the shinobi program.

seeing teh bullshit of teh situation and not buying the bullshit excuses Tsuande was giving him, becuase she is the Hokage and the council hold no real power, at least in his eyes, she did what she did just so they would stop bothering her,

so, he got his chakra sealed and wasa demoted to a civilian.

fueled by spite he somehow, in six weeks develop a cure all thatc an heal and cure anything instantly and witouth consequences that does not cause addiction and can be used repteadely perpetually all in the shape chocolate falvored pill that does not go bad, so you can stockpile it as much as you want and a century old pill would srill have tha same effect as a day old pill.

and when i say anything, i mean anything. critical wounds, lost limbs, degenerative diseases, mental illnesses, poisonings, anything no matter how big or small, one pill and it is gone forever and each is dirty cheap and easy as fuck to to make with widely available ingredients that grow everywhere.

such thing would be a great boon to Konoha and would save lives left right and center, but at teh same time, it would overnight deem medics in general useless, becasue, why spemd years and a fortune training professionals, when you can just use teh same time and money to stockpile pills?

Naruto, still full of spite releases the recipy for teh pill t teh whole world for free, making Tsunade's field of expertise obsolete and driving everysingle medic out of a job."

Google William Trump. He's retarded but seems happy and shit, so Donald shouldn't be a dick about it. Anyways, if any Trump family member deserves a token, its the retarded Trump. A portion of this token will be donated to retards. They are usually cooler than most degens who are also retarded.

2 most favorite words in the degen culture: Trump and Retard.

This has both. And a true story that nobody has spoken about yet. 

Not in crypto at least. Time Magazine did a story about it, as you can read for yourself.

This will moon because the whole Trump family had tokens hit huge market caps, and now it is time for the retarded Trump to have his own token.

Also, we're not making fun of William Trump for being retarded. We kinda all are.

We are making fun of Donald Trump for saying his grand-nephew should ""just die"" because that is just weird.

So please, support this token and have some fun in the TG with us.

Pretty much all we say is durrrrrrr.

Has anyone had two tears in the same meniscus?!,MeniscusInjuries,1i90pnv,2025-01-24 12:23:42,2,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeniscusInjuries/comments/1i90pnv/has_anyone_had_two_tears_in_the_same_meniscus/,SwirlingAbsurdity,General Discussion,"So I’m 8 days post repair and just had a physio appointment where he went over everything that was done in surgery. I knew I had a degenerative tear in my lateral meniscus but it turns out I ALSO had a horizontal tear! Same meniscus but a completely separate tear.

It looks like the MRI only picked up the degenerative one and I’m wondering if I somehow managed to do the horizontal tear after the MRI?! I had a steroid injection after my MRI which gave me complete pain relief and I probably went too hard on the exercise. I don’t remember any specific moment of injuring it but between my MRI and surgery I did develop a deep clunking when I bent my knee which hadn’t been there previously. 

All is good though, I had a little bit of my meniscus trimmed but the rest was repaired with four sutures. Weight bearing and in a brace set to 90 degrees for 6 weeks. Can walk ok but just need my crutches when the aches set in. Physio is really happy with me - just working on building my glutes back up - they’ve already started to atrophy!"

I don’t even know what would have caused it really … I was in a mild car collision but it wasn’t serious. Only a small bump. In my parents friends car. When I was a teen I slipped down some stairs.

Do you set aside hours, if so what hours? How many days a week? I’m sure there are degens in here in the daily but also, I’ve found myself maybe making 1 trade a week based off of my own personal time, work, and the market. I’d love to get a schedule of when I can trade but the market doesn’t like that always… 

I’ve seen some explain they only are premarket trading, which is legit, but volume is the issue there no?

For reference I’m 34m married with a young kid so time and money are a zero sum game. Freelance work so hours in the clock are my only income. Thanks and appreciate it!

Hip replacement for impingement is it worth it?,TotalHipReplacement,1i903du,2025-01-24 11:58:40,1,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TotalHipReplacement/comments/1i903du/hip_replacement_for_impingement_is_it_worth_it/,Lost_Combination_358,❓Question 🤔,"f/47 Hi has anyone had a THR for impingement and had positive results? I've been booked in for THR in 5 weeks. I wanted a hip repair but as I have pincer shape hip and degenerative changes it's not an option. I'm having second thoughts and was wondering if anyone has had the same dilemma - what did you do? I'm 47 and said to surgeon aren't I a bit young but he replied better to have quality of life now but I don't know if it will improve quality of my life. My impingement and labral tear has left me with 50% range of motion in right hip. The x Ray is showing bone on bone at the edge of the joint but as long as I keep within my range it's not that painful. I do suffer pain but it's more from my sacrum and tailbone from have weak pelvic floor and low core strength from having 5 kids. Im worried that the hip replacement won't have any benefit or enough benefit. I don't have pain at night and I can walk ok. My main symptoms are stiffness after being sat down too long, pain and stiffness getting in and out of cars and walking over uneven and sloped ground. After reading others THR experiences on here I'm thinking that it's a bit extreme solution to my problem. It Would be more preventative in my case. I'm seriously on the verge of cancelling it. "
