First impressions as near beginner- Horizon Hobby's Apprentice STOL S 700mm - RTF,RCPlanes,1i9x8vv,2025-01-25 16:15:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RCPlanes/comments/1i9x8vv/first_impressions_as_near_beginner_horizon_hobbys/,Whitebaron1993,,"Hi All, 

Was recently in the market for a small RTF plane to get me back into the hobby and thought I would share in case anyone else is in a similar position.

I was initially looking at the HH Sports Cub s2 RTF as I liked the looks, Flight modes, Panic button and handy size. The reviews suggest it is an excellent aircraft but in my research the Apprentice STOL S 700mm-RTF popped up and caught my attention and ultimately was purchased. 

Why did I buy the Apprentice:

1. Size-Slightly larger but with removable wing so maintains similar portability with a bigger aircraft (bigger is better after all)
2. Propulsion-Brushless motor, directly driving the prop. The Sports cub uses a small brushed motor with a gear to turn the prop and a 1 cell battery. Personally I prefer the idea of a brushless and in videos I have seen I feel the Apprentice is quieter which I think has a lot to do with the propulsion system.
3. Battery-Battery security. The cubs battery is velcroed into a slot in the bottom of the plane and I don't like the idea that a bit of Velcro is all that's holding it in. The apprentice has a magnetic latched canopy and velcro installed inside to secure the battery.
4. Transmitter- The Apprentice comes with a full size transmitter compared to the ""game controller"" style included with the Sports Cub. It is worth noting that the transmitter included with the apprentice is basic and not as powerful as a ""proper"" transmitter but it is the same form factor and has a usb C that allows you to connect it to a pc/laptop and use the included software key to fly in Horizon Hobby's RC flight sim, but more on that later.

Unboxing:

Well packaged and arrived in perfect condition, the box is well designed to be usable for transporting the plane as it feels secure after unboxing as a storage and transport solution. There are lists of what is included in the box online so won't repeat here but everything you will need is included.

First Flight:

In a spur of the moment decision before a big storm blew through I managed to get a short flight in. 

* I did not secure the battery in my haste or check the centre of gravity(CG) and can report the plane remained very docile even without correct CG being checked.
* The plane has plenty power and can nearly climb vertically.
* In beginner mode it is a joy to fly and is a 2 channel experience.
   * the onboard stability system does some mixing of channels 
      * throttle and elevator work together such that to clime or descend you need only adjust the throttle.
      * Ailerons and rudder work together to make nice smooth, coordinated turns.
   * Overall, fun easy flying without breaking a sweat can just enjoy a nice looking plane flying peacefully with zero dramas.
* Intermediate mode mostly just ensures that the plane cannot go inverted but allows more freedom.
* Expert mode total freedom to find out what the plane is and is not capable off
* PANIC!!! the panic button is very a excellent investment protection device as it means that as you venture away from the safe harbour of beginner mode, you have the safety of knowing that if you loose orientation of the plane and don't want to lawn dart your plane into the ground, you can temporarily hand the controls back to the stability system and get your bearing back.

Overall, very pleased with my choice and would thoroughly recommend if anyone is in the market for something similar.

Please let me know if there are any questions I would be happy to help where I can.

This year let's make it different! Let's take this opportunity to create something special together.

I am 26M from Hungary. I am pretty much an introvert (INTJ) and kinda a nerd ig, I have degree of Mathematics (i can help with your math homework) and CS, also I work in IT field.

I like to play videogames and ideally you also would be down to play something together. Maybe just some chill co-op game or even just watch me play while we talk, it is a good way to do stuff together in LDR. We can also watch random series if you are into that. My other hobbies are doing/watching sports, I like F1 and football, also i used to fence and table tennis in college. I used to go hiking a lot from my summer house, maybe we could go there together sometime? I also like to learn about different cultures and languages, I speak several at least in a basic level. I have a goofy ahh family dog but I rarely see her since I moved :c

Physically I am 6'3, white, on the skinnier side. I have blonde hair and blue eyes.

Personality wise: as I already said I am an introvert and kinda quiet sometimes. I am smart and reportedly funny sometimes. I am kind, patient, and I would love to listen to you yap about anything, I am supportive and I would always remember small things u told me. So if you like to get showered with attention and feel loved and special I am a very good choice :3. Also I am loyal and VERY honest about things, so if you are the type of person who gets offended easily this wont work. If I have a problem I would let you know, I do not care if it is something you dont want to hear, honesty is always the best option.

So what I am looking for is a female around the age 20-28, preferably from EU, or would consider move to the EU in the future (if everything works out). But lets just talk and we will see, we can worry about distance stuff later. Appearance wise I dont have much preference, I like girls on the skinnier/fit side, but It doesnt matter as long as you look healthy. I would like us to exchange photos early on. I prefer someone with shared interests and hobbies, or at least be open to try stuff together. I want a relationship where we can be ourself and talk about anything openly. Being with someone where you feel safe and dont have to filter youself all the time is the best feeling. And as I said I value honesty, open communication and loyalty. I am looking for something monogamous obviously, it should go without saying but you cant know in this cooked generation. **Make sure you are actually committed for a LDR and wont change your mind. Also be able to meet up within a reasonable time.**

If this sounds interesting send a small intro and maybe a pic of yourself. I would like to move to a different platform as soon as you are comfortable with it, doesnt matter where, just away from Reddit lmao"

How many of you guys want to be submissive to a dominant woman and don’t really feel masculine?,infp,1i9wxkx,2025-01-25 16:01:02,2,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1i9wxkx/how_many_of_you_guys_want_to_be_submissive_to_a/,Roids_and_bush,Venting,"I’ve been talking to a few women online over the past year that put me in a submissive space that is very comforting. They refer to me as a girl and I can drop any kind of masculine front. It’s just super liberating to be able to have someone talk to me all the time and help me to accept myself im not trans but I’m nonbinary. I don’t get along with straight guys or basic girls who hold men to all these standards. I’ve spent most of my 20s alone using substances just fucking lost. My life is a tragedy I moved around all the time and my parents made up for their neglect by throwing money at me so I got into coke and heroin at 17 and that became like my lover. I’ve been a complete slave to it but I learned how to keep up a facade of looking decent so that I wasn’t completely outcasted from society. My only relationships were with men to get more drugs so I’ve always felt used and disposable and like just a piece of meat. 

I post pics of myself on Reddit to get attention now I finally met some people who talk to me every hour of the day. It’s half sexual and half therapy. I really needed someone to bitch to I guess and in return she sees me like her submissive which has a much stronger hold on me than the rush of injecting Coke or fentanyl I think I need another power in someone with a much higher vibration than me because I would be more lost than ever if she left I really would just stop taking care of myself and fuck my life up."
The car length rule can save your life. I almost learned that the hard way (close call story),driving,1i9wxi5,2025-01-25 16:00:57,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/driving/comments/1i9wxi5/the_car_length_rule_can_save_your_life_i_almost/,Specific_Emu_2045,,"My mom told me when teaching me to drive that you should drive as if the person in front of you could slam on their brakes at any second. One car length per 10 mph, you know the drill.

I caught lacking roughly 5 car lengths behind someone last night. We were each going around 80mph, 15 over but the speed of the traffic. I’m paying attention and other than listening to music my complete attention is on the road.

It’s a Friday night during a local festival. I should’ve been more cautious as I’m sure plenty of people were driving drunk. For visual (straight highway, no turns at all):

>lane 1 (right lane)

>lane 2 (exit lane)

>lane 3 (merge lane from on ramp)

Essentially I was in lane 2 driving ~5 car lengths behind a massive Wagoneer. I see a flashing sign that says “merge,” and I figure it’s for lane 3 to merge into lane 2 due to a partial closure of lane 3, which was correct.

What I *did not* realize, as I couldn’t see past the gigantic car in front of me, was that lane 2 became an exit lane and had come to a standstill from people trying to merge into it from lane 3. I assumed this was not the case, as the vehicle in front of me in lane 2 was going 80mph, so from my perspective the lane obviously must be open. Or else, the Wagoneer would have slowed down or changed lanes long before, right?

Well turns out the Wagoneer in front of me was paying zero attention to the road, and suddenly realized they are about to smash into a line of 20 cars. They swerve into lane 1 and come within inches of crashing into someone else, who slams on their brakes and starts skidding and swerving. Both cars quickly regain control, but by the time I react to this, (5 cars lengths and 80mph closed within a second) I’m in the same position the Wagoneer was. 80mph barreling towards a line of standstill cars maybe 20 feet away. Basically under a second to full stop. Not happening.

Time slows down as my adrenaline hits like a shot of meth and I hear myself say “holy fuck.” Time goes in slow-motion, I feel like I’m underwater and am moving instinctually. Brain thinks 4 things: I can’t move to lane 3 because cars, i can’t stay in lane 2 because cars, I must merge into lane 1 as it’s my only option, and at least I’m gonna go out listening to a nice song.

I swerve smoothly into the lane successfully and continued driving. The guy behind me flashed his brights 2 times. I don’t think he was pissed, I think he saw what just played out and wanted to make sure I’m still focused.

Thankfully, no collision happened between any vehicles involved, but it was *so fucking close.* The entire incident took place in less than a couple seconds. I am 100% convinced if there had happened to have been a car in lane 1 at that exact moment where I merged, I would be at best a vegetable and at worst a red smear.

I realize there were mistakes I made regardless of the Wagoneer driver putting me in that position. I should not have been speeding in the right lane like a moron. I should have been more careful and aware of potential drunk drivers. And most importantly, I should have been at least a full 8 car lengths behind the Wagoneer to allow time for a stop.

I’m currently at work wracked with anxiety and mild PTSD. I keep playing the incident over and over in my head. What could I have done differently? What if I had killed other people and myself? Worse—what if I had killed other people and lived? What if I had glanced at my phone and lost focus for a moment? Would I have even realized I was in an accident?

Adrenaline kept me up all night and it’s now wearing off. I’m shaking and sweating and anxious. Writing this up has made me feel a bit better. I think this is the closest I’ve been to dying and certainly the most terrified I’ve ever been in a car. Driving to work was hell and I’m scared to drive back.

The moral of the story? A car length for every 10 mph, no exceptions. Follow this rule and it might save your life."
I worked at PTSB. Help me expose PTSBs unethical and illegal practices.,u_Chance_Zucchini5048,1i9wwrf,2025-01-25 16:00:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Chance_Zucchini5048/comments/1i9wwrf/i_worked_at_ptsb_help_me_expose_ptsbs_unethical/,Chance_Zucchini5048,,"I am exposing PTSB, its horrific working conditions and the scams they play on customers. If you’re up for helping me then you can skip to the end. If you want to know my story, read on…

First of all. As an ex-customer and staff member of PTSB, I can promise you all, that in a few years’ time, we will all be using FinTech banks like Revolut. The age of banks is already dead so, I have no problem whatsoever, exposing and hopefully destroying the reputation of this pointless worthless bank.

I was a customer of PTSB for 18years and sadly, I worked for them for a brief period of time.

Let me tell you my experience and, appeal to both staff and customers, to help me take down this absolute disgrace of a bank.

I was hired as a ''Customer Service Champion'' (stupid name for a banking advisor) in a Dublin branch. I had already worked in a couple of banks in a similar role so this was nothing new to me.

I found out, I was replacing a young girl who was traumatised by a customer. She was a cashier who caught the attention of an extremely sick individual who came to the bank every day to perv on her. He would arrive at the desk with gifts for her like perfume and jewellery. He would wait outside the bank for her and eventually, would take the same bus as her and follow her home.

She complained to the territory manager on a number of occasions, but nothing was done about it. No protections were put in place for her and her safety was completely ignored. Eventually, her parents complained to the manager who, decided it would be best that she be transferred elsewhere, like she was the problem.

That is exactly how management treat their staff that they are responsible for. Like they are disposable objects. Not worthy of any respect or empathy.

The man in question continued to visit the bank. We all ignored him, but it never stopped him following the female staff into offices and stationary cupboards. However, no one else complained because they knew it could affect their careers.

Staff do not receive any training whatsoever. Nothing. There is the usual mandatory training that is regulatory but has no impact on how to carry out your job dealing with customer queries. As regards to using the actual Uniscreens or SMART systems, there is no training. No training on how to use the cash desk. Nothing.

You have to hope that the other members of staff will show you, but it is completely dependent on whether or not they want to which, in my case, they weren’t.

Although the branch staff may appear to be operating as a team, they are not. Each member of staff has their own assigned job roles, customer cases and is in a hurry to get out for lunch at their allotted time and also, get home at a reasonable hour. They don’t have the time to aid a new staff member nor, in my case, were they willing. New staff are not given access to most systems and are not qualified to make any sales so, without help from other staff, new members are cannon fodder for angry customers and scape goats when something goes wrong.

By the way, the bank closes at 5 however, staff rarely get out before 7 in most cases. All unpaid overtime.

PTSB, as an institution, could not care less about the customers they are supposed to serve. Let me repeat that for any customer reading this. You are not valued in any shape or form. PTSB and, as a result, PTSB staff do not want you in the branch at all. You are considered a complete and utter nuisance. Staff literally gasp when they see you approach or watch you all queue outside or join the queue for the cash desk.

PTSB staff are only there for one purpose and one purpose only. To sell you insurance. You come to the bank for anything else, no one cares. If you are interested in home and contents insurance, you are listened to. They also push you to sign away your life savings to Irish life. The best scam ever, was closing down customers current accounts and making them sign up for Explore accounts. The script we gave customers was that it is better for your credit rating to have an explore account. Its only €6 per month and you make 10 cent cash back on purchases. After everyone signed up to the idea, PTSB increased the fee to €8 and reduced the cash back to 5 cent, capping it at €5. A simple yet effective scam.

PTSB customers are being played for fools. They offer you loans and mortgages at low rates only to sell them all to Pepper Finance who double any rates you signed up for. That’s why they bought Ulster Bank. To take its loan book and screw over all its customers. Has that happened to you? If so, you were 100% scammed.

Remember, I am ex staff, so I had all of this information explained to me.

PTSB have removed most of their cash desks and reduced the opening hours of the ones that remain, all to dissuade customers from coming to branch. There are a lot of overheads keeping branches open, especially the extra 25 acquired Ulster banks. They instead have put in place flimsy self-service machines and online banking portals. Let me tell you, these are the most disgustingly vile dirty machines that no one should touch believe me. They are forever breaking down and no one in the branch can fix them. An engineer visit has to be arranged which can take days. Again, to dissuade customers from coming to the branches. Instead, customers are directed to the app. The online banking and app are the most bare basic, useless outdated services that can do nothing but tell you your balance. That’s it. The other port of call is the telephone banking service which all of you know, is just to keep you on hold for an hour then cut you off.

As a result, customers come to the branch already enraged. They have to take time off work to come to the branch to be told they can’t withdraw their own money because they didn’t give enough notice, or they don’t have the right ID or the timer hasn’t been set. No, it’s because PTSB doesn’t have the cash to hand out. This is actually funny to me because when I was there, the manager stole €5000 and it was written off??! It’s a sinking ship of a bank that has lost a lot of its investors already.

Because the branch staff are not trained to handle any queries apart from setting up the app, customers become aggressive towards the staff like everything is their fault. I have witnessed customers screaming in staffs faces, corner them in offices, throw things at them. I’ve personally been grabbed, slapped, hands around my neck.

One female cashier had been with the bank 2 years. She took the main brunt of anger from customers. The mortgage advisor told me its because the customers are racist. Her and another white cashier with 6 months service were up for contract renewal. Guess which one kept their job… Classic racist PTSB. And also, PTSBs pride month celebration. It’s a marketing campaign. The managers incentivise staff to go to the parade and fly the PTSB banner for advertisement. They give those staff a day off. If they cared at all about PRIDE, they would go themselves, for free!

I have never seen a customer punished for aggressive behaviour. The managers always excused this behaviour and commended staff for not reacting to it. Managers don’t care about anyone but themselves. They are couped up in the offices all day, often hung over, dreaming about the next PTSB award ceremony where they can lick up to higher management and pat each other on the back for achieving absolutely nothing. PTSB is nothing more than a club for managers.

I should mention, customers who do come to branch to make a complaint are left waiting for as long as possible (to annoy you) then, after you finally utter that magical incantation “I want to speak to a manger” the manager arrives, pretends to listen to you, sends you on your merry way then, we all laugh at you in the lunchroom. No customer has ever made a complaint, especially in branch, that was ever recorded or handled or taken seriously.

Staff are hired on a 6-month probation basis which rarely gets renewed. Any staff over the last few years who lasted longer than 6 months are either staff they couldn’t sack during the covid pandemic or staff they absorbed from Ulster Bank that are on separate contracts. There are staff that are recruited through third party agencies that are forever held on a probationary basis that can be kept indefinitely or sacked at a moment’s notice. In six months, I saw 2 people sacked, 2 found jobs in different banks, 1 deserted and 3 transferred to another branch. The customers then have to suffer a lack of staff and services but who cares about them. Right PTSB?

I handed in my notice after 3 months. Couldn’t handle the toxic atmosphere, the aggression from customers and for being part of an organisation that scams the public. My manger convinced me to stay, and he would transfer me to a better department. I trusted him. I kept my mouth shut and head down. I made it to the 6-month mark. I was called into the office for what I believed was to be told I was being made permanent and being transferred somewhere else. Nope. I was sacked. No actual reason given but I was on probation so, all’s fair.

Turns out a new branch lead joined 2 months previous. Some alcoholic who used to be in airport security. She spent most Mondays in the office with her headphones on pretending to be on a call while nursing a hangover. Well, only on the Mondays that she came to work. Anyway, she told the manager on her first week she didn’t like me and wanted me sacked. Of course, no one mentioned this to me, so I didn’t even have a chance to find another job. Just told, your out. Got a handshake and that was that.

O, I was also told that I had to make a goodbye speech to everyone, thanking them for a wonderful experience or, I wouldn’t get a reference for my next job. Its all part of the plan to protect them from disgruntled ex-employees complaining about them.

I contacted the Financial services union, but they can’t do anything because legislation has left them powerless.

I filed a discrimination case, but PTSB hire an investigator from a company called Resolve Ireland, who interviews complainants, finds out what evidence they have against the bank then gets rid of it before the case goes to court. Clever really.

Anyway. I hate this bank. I see hundreds of reviews online from staff and customers who hate this bank as much as me. So,

I am gathering evidence from customers who have been mistreated. Any stories you have are totally welcome. Any evidence you have is even better.

I am already demanding from the retail officer, that all maintenance fees are reimbursed for the payment’s disruptions over Christmas, but I need your back up.

Staff. Please record any interactions you have with your manager. These people are not your friends no matter what they say. Their job is to keep you in line and dispose of you when it suits them. 500 members of staff are planned to be sacked this year. Do you really think your managers are going to choose to leave or, will they sack you instead? The best defence is to record everything your manager tells you. You should not be in the office alone with your manager without representation. Everything you tell them is compiled and kept on record to be used against you in the future. Compile your own evidence!

Also, email them everything that was said in the office and email me a copy. That way they can’t deny in the future what ever lies and false promises they made you.

This will give you a solid basis to prevent unfair dismissal and I will back you up every step of the way.

I will compile all of this evidence and use it to ensure staff are treated fairly, given safe working conditions, paid for every second they spend in the bank after 5 o clock, are given time off after every traumatic encounter with aggressive customers and hold managers responsible for unfair dismissal and discrimination.

“He didn’t propose,” Steffi clarified, tempering expectations. “He wanted to talk about our future together.”

“How did that conversation go?”

“Not too well,” Steffi lamented while trying to recall the difficult conversation with Mark. While being fair in her recollection, she nevertheless ended up painting herself as the victim. “He then basically said I only love him for his money.”

Maya gave her a wordless and patronizing stare.

“You know it’s more complicated than that,” Steffi said in an attempt to defend herself.

Maya challenged her. “Is it really that complicated? What if Mark lost his job?”

“I’m not going to answer a hypothetical.”

“And hypothetically speaking,” Maya continued, ignoring Steffi’s last remark, “what if tomorrow he asks you to marry him?”

After staring at her for a moment, Steffi looked away before she could answer the question. “Help me with this dress, will you?”

\*\*\*\*\*

Mark and Steffi stood facing one another at the altar, looking deeply into each other’s eyes.

“You may now kiss the bride.”

He leaned over for the kiss that would seal their destiny. At that very moment, he felt a nudge on the side of his chest. His body gently shook in his chair and he jerked his head up, awakening from his daydream.

“Hey, you’re dozing off,” Lucy whispered. “It’s going to start soon.”

“Sorry. I didn’t get too much sleep last night.”

“You’re not excited? I take it you’re not a wedding person.”

For an extended moment, he looked up to the front of the assembled area and watched Steffi projecting elegance in her bridesmaid dress. “No, apparently I’m not.”

Studying his face and tone, Lucy easily picked up the hint. “What about you two? You’ve been together for a while now.”

“I’m not sure we’re there yet,” he dismissed.

“I know for a fact she wants to settle down,” she reassured, trying to comfort and encourage him.

“Yeah? Well, it’s hard to tell with her.” He kept mentally circling back to the night he had this conversation with Steffi, which was left unresolved.

“Maybe you’re not asking the right question.” She then decided to stop talking in circles and went off on a tangent. “You two are so stubborn. I get that she’s like that, but you weren’t always like this.”

“What do you mean?”

“You were hopelessly pining for Steffi when I first met you. I actually felt bad for you because of how she was treating you. But at the same time, it was kind of cute.”

“You knew?”

“Mark, everyone knew.”

He flushed with a light embarrassment, but he failed to see the point she was trying to make. “Is this supposed to make me feel better?”

“No.” She sheepishly smiled at him. Before she could continue her thoughts, they were interrupted by the sounds of musical instruments filling the room. They rose from their chairs along with the rest of the congregation.

As everyone waited for the bride to make her entrance, he turned and whispered to her, “You know that part about me being cute? That’s just what I wanted everyone else to see.”

“Ok Mark, whatever.” She smiled at his feeble attempt to save face. “If it makes you feel any better, all the girls were jealous of Steffi. And by the way, if things really don’t work out with her, I’ll marry you. I’ll be your backup.”

Hearing the ridiculous notion, he could only assume it was a joke. Feeling disinterested in the wedding itself, he turned his attention toward Steffi’s direction only to find her already staring at him. They smiled at each other as the traditional wedding march began."

💥 Ripple Effects of Trump-Era Hype  
ICYMI, whispers of pro-crypto vibes from a potential Trump presidency are fueling market “oomph.” Rumors about a national reserve for U.S.-backed tokens like $XRP and $SOL are pushing interest through the roof. If regulatory clarity and innovation-focused policies roll in, Ozak AI could ride that wave straight into crypto royalty.  

🐶 $DOGE FOMO Turns Eyes Toward Future-Proof Tokens  
Let’s spill some tea on $DOGE: Sure, our favorite meme king saw a 320% glow-up last year thanks to Musk mania.

"Was completely obsessed with my ex and disrespected her boundaries, how do I go on?",DecidingToBeBetter,1i9wqb5,2025-01-25 15:52:18,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1i9wqb5/was_completely_obsessed_with_my_ex_and/,Mikes_Movies_,Seeking Advice,"So this is gonna be kinda messy but I’ll explain it as concisely as I can.

I met my ex girlfriend almost a year ago, and we quickly fell into a relationship that was seemingly perfect. We met in college, had great friends around us, and spent the entire summer together with zero issues. I feel in love with her and I thought she did with me as well.

She had a traumatic childhood, and would at times be triggered by any number of things and recede heavily. I tried to communicate and was always there for her, but at a point this trauma and avoidant tendency caused her to lose feelings for me. She broke up, claiming I had never done anything wrong and she loved me but didn’t want to drag me down with her.

I was distraught, we stayed in contact and 3 weeks later met and reconciled. She promised to be better about communication and I promised I would be better about my clinginess issues.

Unfortunately this worked for about a month before our issues sprung up again, I got anxious, she got distant. I tried to communicate, she shut down. We got into a fight, and broke up again.

Once again I was in chase mode, I couldn’t accept the reality that she didn’t want to be with me anymore, and for the last 3 months I have sent texts, asked to talk, written sappy letters, and basically done every single thing everyone tells you NOT to do after a breakup.

I wrote her a letter before Christmas begging for one more chance, gave it to her, and then spent winter break really thinking. I realized it was for the best ultimately, and I wanted to reach out again and talk, telling her I was ready to let it go and I hope we could be friendly. I got no response naturally.

Yesterday, I discovered she blocked me on Snapchat and my number. A rational person would let this go, but I got angry and impulsive. I messaged her on instagram a long emotional and angry text, and finally got a response.

She was furious. She listed everything wrong with me, called me selfish, manipulative, inconsiderate, and essentially told me that she hates me.

I apologized, told her she was right about it all, and that I can’t fix what I’ve done and that I’m truly sorry I let my worst tendencies get the best of me, but it’s no excuse.

This was the kick to the stomach I think I needed. I have been nothing short of crazy the last few months, and I can’t imagine how much pressure I’ve put on someone who’s already mentally unstable with my constant need for attention and communication.

The bridge between us is completely burned, and it’s almost entirely my fault. I’ve ruined my reputation among our mutual friends, and I feel like I’m genuinely a bad and selfish person.

She’s not perfect, and I think some stuff she said was rewriting history, but perception is reality.

What do I do from here? I want to be better, I can’t believe I was capable of such awful behavior and I never ever want to act like this ever again. I’ve officially cut all contact and I’m positive I will never reach out again, and she’ll probably never forgive me. I don’t deserve it.

Am I a terrible person? Is there any hope that I can become more considerate of others perspectives and wishes?"
"As a serial procrastinator, it was surprisingly easy to turn life around",u_FrumpyScrumpy,1i9wjkf,2025-01-25 15:44:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FrumpyScrumpy/comments/1i9wjkf/as_a_serial_procrastinator_it_was_surprisingly/,FrumpyScrumpy,,"I have always been a procrastinator to an extent. The habit probably started with academics, where I would need only 1-2 days to study for exams, leading to a habit of 'optimizing' time spent for studying, and gradually, all tasks.

As with all academics, it eventually got tougher and massive amounts of stress during college entrance prep led to burnout and a procrastinating habit. 

Now, after nearly 9 depressing years, I think I am starting to beat the procrastinating habit. 

For a habit that changed the trajectory of my career and life, it was surprisingly easy to break out of it. Of course, the universe came together to manufacture the set of circumstances I needed to give me a push, but the 'mental resistance' that you fear as a procrastinator was surprisingly less!

I have no clue what is the most precise way to beat procrastination, but I'll just yap about my journey in hopes of extracting information. 

For the first time in my life after I turned 14, I have reduced my levels of stress to a manageable levels.

First it was the college entrance exams, for which the amount of stress was unimaginable (and which I believe irrevocably alterred my brain chemistry), next was college with the constant pressure of academics, loneliness, job hunt and Covid. After failing to get into my dream college, I just retreated in my shell. Stopped connecting with people. Stopped studying like I used to, instead just cramming something for exams without understanding it and somehow getting by. I spent the majority of my college life (before Covid hit) watching movies or sitcoms on my laptop. I got into a relationship at the end of college, but that didn't last. Made only one friend with whom I stay in touch with.

After college, I landed a pretty decent internship. But even in the internship, my problems with socialising and worries about getting a return offer or a job through campus placements was sufficiently high. High enough that most of my internship is a haze. I cannot remember events which I was a part of, because I was too locked in my head, in my thoughts to pay attention to what was happening around me.

Things got so bad that I got the news that I had high cholesterol in my very first full body checkup at 24.

But funnily enough, that cholesterol report was one of two triggers that led to improvements in my life. The second was.... a girl!

Nope, she's not my girlfriend. She occupies a special place in my heart, so if she were to ask me out, I'd probably say yes. But I don't believe myself to be capable of handling a relationship just yet, so I never flirted or spoke with her with intentions of asking her out. I probably never will think of her in that way. But I am thankful to her.

We met on Reddit, actually. I had made a comment about being a grammar nazi, and she DMed me, asking to be friends. Slow, probing DMs turned into lenghty DMs about each other's lives which turned to phone calls and then turned into a meetup which itself featured the craziest adventure that I have ever had in my life, and our friendship was cemented. She has moved out of the country but we still talk almost everyday.

But enough about the journey, and moving on to how these two things helped me. In the chronological order.

The girl was a paragon of good habits. Waking up at 6, sleeping at 10. Not drinking or smoking. Gymming or swimming everyday. Spending time in her hobbies, all of which were productive. I admit, I may be putting her on a pedestal here, but she was just that good initially. 

You are the sum of the people you meet. And with such a industrious person who I had the privilege of counting among my friends, I started to wake up early. I don't know how this happened, but it did. She would say good night at 10, and I would log off my phone at 11. She would say good morning at 6, and I would feel guilty about leaving her hanging so I started to wake up early too!

And eventually I settled into a comfortable routine of waking up at 8, and sleeping at 12. I don't think people realize just how crucial sleep is to our emotional and physical wellbeing. Having been on both sides of the wall, I believe sleep is the most important 'nutrient' by far today. Nothing even comes close. Hunger may give you stomach ache, but a person can survive for upto 30 days without food. But go 3 days without sleep, and you are already on the verge of shutting down.

Anyways, meeting her got me into the habit of waking up early, and consequently sleeping early. Not wasting time on the internet till 6 am, which I used to do on a regular basis. 

The second was the cholesterol report. This was 2 months after meeting her. Work had been kicking my ass, and shooting my stress levels high. My full body checkup was scheduled after a particularly harrowing week. I had worked for 18 hours for 8 days straight excluding the commuting time, often sleeping for 3 hours or less. Now, I have to mention that my work should NOT require this much efforts. I'll talk more about this later, but this situation was unnecessary and avoidable.

This report made me realise that unless I exercised regularly, I would end up dead of heart attack by 32. I am not joking, but I had noticed my chest tightening uncomfortably sometimes. I started going to the gym in the morning, and incorporated night walks in my routine. The desperate will to live is a strong motivator. Stronger than the depressed me from college would have thought.

Basically, the waking up early and exercising is working wonders for me. Such a simple piece of wisdom, and such a long journey to obtain it. I find it mildly amusing, to tell you the truth.

My body is better than ever. My chest doesn't feel tight anymore. I sleep better. Every day is 'fresher'. This won't mean anything to someone who hasn't experienced burnout, but to someone who has... you'll know what I mean. Work is better. My hard work last year got me promoted with a huge hike in salary. There is no Damoclean Sword hanging over my head, so stress levels are the lowest they've been since my life got derailed.

Where I wasted 9 months of college exam prep time because of procrastination, I am slowly getting the hang of getting things done.

It is a wonderful thing. To do what you want to do when you want to do it. To not worry about the sheer length of the work to be done, only to put it off for later and watch it as it slowly grows humongous. To not panic about work at the last moment, the last minute or the last day.

Shopping for clothes. Talking to old friends. Going on a vacation. So many things that I've been meaning to do since so long, procrastinating as always. All happening in the next two months. 

I have come out from a long, long limbo. I hope my life continues moving into the light."
My patient died during a hearing test,audiology,1i9wi6u,2025-01-25 15:42:27,24,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/audiology/comments/1i9wi6u/my_patient_died_during_a_hearing_test/,thomcatify,,"First, sorry this isnt a post about a regular audiologic topic, but I always wonderwd if this happened to anyone else? 

So, this happened a few years ago while I was working as an audiologist in scandinavia. Monday morning, got to work with my eyes barely open. First patient was quick, just a normal pure-tone-audiometry for the ENT. Then a quite old lady got wheelchaired through the doors alongside her son. She was 90+, her son in his late sixties/early seventies. She wasnt in very good shape, but could communicate and understood my instructions. She was getting new hearing aids. 

Got her into the booth helped by her son. This particular day I had two students with me, they were learning the basics of audiometry. I instructed one of them to start the testing, and I sat next to her observing.

We got to 4khz on her right ear, and then, no more response. The booth had a window, and I watched her head fall to her chest through it.

I quickly understood something was wrong, and rushed inside and tried to get contact with her, but she was lifeless. I then ran over to her sok and said something like: I think your mother fell asleep (I was really stressed out). He walked up to her and shook her, and then turned to me and said: I think she’a dead.

I have never been in a situasion like this before, but gathered my thoughts and realized there is a doctor and a nurse in the floor above. I ran up, told them what happened, and we all went back stairs. They brought a heart starter, and I called the pramedics. They started giving her mouth to mouth and applying the electrodes on her chest, and her son yelled «no, please, she has said that she dont want medical attention in a situasion lile this, please stop trying to bring her back to life».

They kept going anyway, but she was dead, and soon the ambulance and a doctor came and called it. Quite a start of the week! Really unpleasant experience.

How to deal with difficult government agencies,neighborsfromhell,1i9wf3g,2025-01-25 15:38:40,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1i9wf3g/how_to_deal_with_difficult_government_agencies/,Fawn-Bettina-Human,Other,"I keep reading posts where people continue to report their NFH and nothing is ever done. So, I thought I would share a technique I learned many years ago when I was in the military. I've found it to be extremely effective...

1) You have to research and know what laws or bi-laws, ordinances, rules, etc are being broken. You're not likely to get much traction if none were or you don't know.

2) Gather evidence. Keep a diary of events, NFH's actions, your actions/response, and when/who you notified. Complaints about your NFH blasting music at 2am may not get you very far. But, if you can show a video or picture of a decibel meter between a clock and glass of water with ripples in it...that's different. If you produce a doorbell video of your NFH screaming, ""Get out here, I'm gonna F--- YOU UP,"" I'll bet a court will take notice. If you complain about your neighbor ripping down your fence...include a property survey and pictures. Without evidence, it's easy for authorities to ignore you.

3) Safeguard evidence and all documents. Obtain copies of all police reports if any pertain. Keep everything in a safe place. Never release or give out your originals or last copy of something...only ever provide a copy from your files. If you think your life might be in danger, or evidence stolen/destroyed...send a copy to someone you trust in a different State or Country.

4) While you're gathering evidence, also do what you can to mitigate damages/impacts, protect yourself/others, and deescalate the situation if possible. Include this in your diary/time table.

5) Write a letter or email to the government agency having jurisdiction or a responsibility to act. Attach a copy of evidence, police reports, and diary/time table. Specify what laws were/are being broken and by whom. Include your desired outcome and expected time of resolution. You have to give the agency a reasonable amount of time to act and solve the problem, but don't give them too much or they'll forget about you. Get everything into written form...phone calls allow agencies to stall or claim they were never informed.

6) When the agency fails to act or no resolution is achieved, write them again. Shorten the time you're giving them this time. Include the previous letter(s) as Enclosure/Attachment (basically a copy of everything you sent them before). With this one, and all future letters/emails pertaining to the matter, send them with tracking (USPS Tracking works well) or return receipt. By doing this you're eliminating the possibility they can claim ignorance. AND, and this is very important, send a copy (CC) to their boss (also with tracking or return receipt). You don't need to send all the evidence to the boss (yet) as your goal at this point is to give a ""Head's up.""

7) Still no action/resolution... Write the boss! Shorten the time even more. Include a copy of all the evidence, plus previous letters. Send it out with tracking. AND, and this is very important, fill out the ""CC"" portion of the letter with the boss's boss's name...and obviously send the copy as well. Again, you don't have to send the boss's boss a copy of all the evidence...yet.

8) Start working your way up the ""Chain of Command"" or ""Food Chain"" using #6 and #7 as guides...Rinse and Repeat technique. You are creating evidence as you go...proving the lower levels were notified and failed to resolve the problem. And they can't claim they didn't know because you've got the tracking numbers that say otherwise.

9) Never complain to a lower level. For example... If your NFH is a Sheriff's Deputy, DO NOT start with your local police...go directly to Sheriff's Office Internal Affairs, State Police, State AG's Office, or even the FBI.

10) Do NOT be afraid to jump to a higher jurisdiction/person/agency when you've reached the top. Example... After reaching the Chief of Police, continue on to City Council and Mayor...or jump to State Police, State AG's Office, etc.

11) When you reach elected officials... Guess who the Mayor answers to? The Governor? Your Congressmen and Senators? Yep, they all answer to the voters! How do you notify the voters? Through your local media (TV, Radio Station, Newspaper, Internet sites, etc). It helps if elections are nearing. Even pointing out, in your letter, when one is up for re-election will get their attention. But, you'd better have good hard evidence if you reach that high, and especially before going to media.

12) I've found it's usually better to ask questions than throw accusations. Examples... **Are laws being selectively enforced? Are City Officials prejudiced against (\_\_\_\_\_)? Would you allow your children to play in this yard (see Enclosure #1)?**...#1 is picture of lawn next to fence with clumps of dog feces thrown there by NFH. **Would you consider 82dB excessive?** (Used when city ordinance #12-567 only states ""Excessive noise prohibited...""...with Enclosure picture showing reading of 82dB on meter between clock showing 12:23am and glass of water with major ripples in it). **Shouldn't I be able to feel safe walking to my car in the morning?** (Enclosure #2 is 12 pictures on two pages...obviously all taken on different days...of NFH's Pitbull, clearly off-leash, in a front yard, taking dumps next to a car.) I think you get the idea. No actual accusations were made...just questions asked...

I know this was lengthy, and I'm sorry. But, I hope you enjoyed reading it anyway and gained a valuable tool you can use when government agencies try to ignore you or stall. Often they don't want to get involved in neighbor disputes, so evidence and documentation are key.

I hope this helps..."
Rethink Strategies,Defeat_Project_2025,1i9wda5,2025-01-25 15:36:23,13,0.93,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1i9wda5/rethink_strategies/,jpnlongbeach,,"First- I think the over 80k sum individuals in this sub-reddit deserve and Thank You and thank and appreciate each other for being and showing concerns in all that is going on in America in the negative messages and impact identified in Project 2025. Even to those that do not share written ideas, being actively involved at scheduled/specific times daily or weekly to keep informed and hitting the like icon shows the issues are important. And thanks to those who take the time to inform us what is happening in their local area that is of concern and sharing what efforts are being taken, suggested, effective locally or in their State.

As we know, P2025 is here. It’s no longer a threat. To those we know that said “oh it’s not going happen” or “it’s just political BS, it won’t happen” we should observe those that we know that didn’t believe this would occur how they are feeling now. Not so much to tell them “told you so” but to attempt to gage how they are feeling now with DJT recent actions. 
  —Are they disappointed and now aware he’s not helping the 99% (who they are a part of)? 
  —Are they upset about his recent actions and do they see his actions are hurting the 99%?  
        -If, yes,  are they willing/able to identify who is responsible? 
        -If yes, are they struggling to accept who is responsible?
        -If yes, are they still in denial and make excuses or blame someone else?

I think it’s important for us to attempt to assess those we know how they feel now. If they are upset, can admit this is not what they want DJT to do and that DJT’s actions within the last week is not helping them- then there is opportunity to educate and change they support of DJT.

Efforts to assess those we know is important to understand if they are they paying attention to DJT’s recent actions, all of them. Do they think what they have heard makes any sense to them. Are they aware of the details?
    —Do really want to know the details and what the impact is/will be to them directly or indirectly?
    —Do they feel/believe DJT’s recent actions have no direct impact to them, thus, ignore?

If those we know, are still in clear denial, defensive, still blame someone else and/or seriously believe/support DJT recent actions are justified- is that their true belief? Or is it the belief because it’s the message they have repeatedly heard?

Attempts and efforts to observe/reassess, those we know, without engaging in arguing with them, is helpful in our own personal efforts with those we know.

Local/State community- observe/pay attention to your local/State communities, local news media. What information is being communicated from local area media on his recent actions. Are his Executive Orders signed being discussed? Is it all of them or certain ones? How is local media spinning the EO’s? Is local media reporting that none of DJT’s EO’s are/will improve lower prices, lower food costs, reduce medial/RX costs, reduce housing costs, increasing living wage, increase employment?

If local community is not being informed of the issues above and the negative impact, this identifies a RED flag for those living or know someone living in these areas.

I believe reassessing locally and those we know is important to understand as it it is also key on how best to proceed realistically.

Next- if we have not understood by now, it’s clear there is no one person/agency that is going to step in and wave a wand and correct this.

Marches get ignored. Calling/letter writing to Republican Congress is ignored, even if some are not MAGA, the majority Republicans either stay quiet and still vote what DJT wants and then the MAGA that chose getting media time but doing or saying stupid things in hopes that DJT “likes” them. Republican Party  caving in to supporting the EO’s DJT is signing, that do not benefit the 99% and actually hurt the 99%- Republicans choose to support DJT and not the 99%.

Mid-Terms- If enough of 99% vote Republicans out for supporting their interests and not the 99%. There’s hope. However, that’s 2-years away and a lot of damage to the 99% and our Country will be done.

Back to Basics-Grassroots-
1. We cannot tune out or give up. That’s the worst response.
2. DJT did NOT win by a landslide and the EO’s he is signing is NOT a mandate from “Americans”.
  — DJT is pushing his own agenda and the agenda from specific billionaires and their special interests to push their specific interests.
        —-It is critical that their strategy to push their agenda is communication propaganda. Create issues, fear, scapegoats to media, church groups etc. to sway as many of the 99% to mislead and believe the propaganda. DJT was perfect to carry this out. And he did. He pushed lies, hate, misinformation to control the narrative and right wing media pushed it out. They repeatedly this constantly that facts were lost. They got mainstream media to not report, downplay, not to question. They have now got social media- X, Facebook to no longer focus on genuine social contact that is positive- we are nominally by specific ads they sold our information to, special interests mislead, FB is following X, where hate, misinformation, right wing/MAGA will beef up marketing messaging to continue to gaslight it’s users. And with DJT now supporting TicTok, it’s safe to say his support was not for the users, his support is like X and FB, TicTok will also fall in line to push out far right/MAGA messages that will beef marketed to that app.
     — These social apps are becoming propaganda tools.

Want to take control and send a message?
1. Admit these apps have and are losing their initial purpose- social interaction. They do not makes us social in a positive way, were are less social than ever, app social contacts are seriously limited by “likes”- but genuine interpersonal social contact isn’t there, it’s impacted real life interactions, the list can go on but it’s clear they are now being used more to push propaganda.
      Grassroots Action/Send a Message- Close these Apps. Accept that they lost their initial purpose positive social aspect. Accept the amount of time they occupy us. Accept it has changed real life interactions- which are more critical and valuable. Accept that most of what is pushed on the apps is crap and distracts us from real life living, affects our we communicate, affects our attention span, overloads, etc.  we can survived with out these apps. Closing Apps, getting friends, family to do the same- sends message to the billionaires who own the apps and sold out to DJT, it sends a message to the advertisers on those apps.
     — Download pics and contacts that mean something to you.
     — For real/meaning social interaction- create family, friends, specific interests email groups/zoom/video call groups. Communicate with those that are important to your daily life and support system.

-Grassroots- local/State- contact, communicate with local/State individuals, groups, politicians that support what is important to you and pertain to local/State negative impact of P2025. This develops your local contacts, interactions and keeps you informed and involved as much as you’re able to do.
    —Support local politicians, candidates, school boards, elected Judges, that disagree with P2025.
    —Learn who and about your local/County election boards, procedures.
   —Contact the local chain stores owed by national corporations- express your concerns in their policies that supporting higher prices, discrimination, false blaming DEI. Let them know you are unhappy.
   —Choose where you shop/eat out locally and online. It’s unrealistic to boycott every chain owned by a national corporation that is supporting DJT, but you can buy essentials needed, not buy what you really don’t need. Save that money or buy local owners- support them. Stop eating out or choose where you eat out-support locals that support everyone in your community. Just be mindful where you spend your money where you can. If local or chain businesses in your community support DJT or support what is in P2025- don’t give them your money or at least limit supporting them.

Grassroots- Keep informed- this is critical. Set times and amount of time to stay informed what is occurring nationally- support reliable independent news. There are independent media that discuss national issues/MAGA efforts daily in 10-20 min, issue presented, why it’s a concern, they play the audio/video clip, written from the source, and share nationally how/who is fighting back that support us. YouTube channels/Podcasts- such as: Democracy Watch, Legal AF, MeidasTouch News, Bryan Taylor Cohen, Politics Girl- are just a few.
Ground News is an independent App that scans news topic from corporate and independent news groups, tracks the trends of how the news item is presented and how and the source, this helps to determine the accuracy or bias so you can better understand. If you are informed you can help those around you and show them how the news issue is presented, is it biased, accurate, etc. this can be a huge time saver.

The change we want to see and the negative that is being pushed upon us- it is going to be up to us to individually and work with others locally and within our States to support each other. Show our rights and democratic values are important, help educate the MAGA creates issues to distract us- focus on real issues, not cultural propaganda- Tax laws benefitting the super wealthy is a huge issue that impacts the 99% in every comment. Living wage, stable employment, reasonable housing costs, intentional high costs of food, tariffs impact the 99%, mass deportations of non criminals is not our problem- it impacts businesses and products/foods we all eat, we are not being invaded at our borders- that is propaganda. Enhancing the tools, processes, Judges, timely and safely is important, Politicians and right wing media- any media that spreads news information without fact checking is a problem when their is no consequences, mass shootings is a problem, reducing healthcare costs is important, supporting public education is important, infrastructure is important, our public health and safety is important, electing politicians that work to better our Country and work to improve all of our daily lives is important, removing/holding politicians and all media sources available to the public to report news that is accurate and fact checked is important, severe consequences to those that intentionally spread information that is not fact checked before being released. This is an issue that must be important to all of us."

He calls me every night and we text a lot, lately things have felt distant. He isn’t as emotionally attached as I am anymore, I brought this to his attention this morning and it went really well. He said he can give me more reassurance etc, then mentioned there is a lot going on with his family that he doesn’t want to talk about with me. I’m okay with him not feeling comfortable to talk about things like that, but I always offer a shoulder to lean on if he needs anything. I felt like he is placing alot of blame on that situation so I texted him this morning after we called and basically said if we need to put things on pause so he can focus on himself and outside forces. We just bought a ticket for him to come see me like 2 days ago too. Now he has ignored me for 2 hours, and I know this because he is always on his phone. Everybody is always in their phone. Just looking for what to do, I thought we felt the same way about eachother and often times I wear my heart on my sleeve. Just overall feeling super hurt, I want to be there for him but he won’t allow that, which is okay, again I understand but I’m trying so hard to be there. I just need some insight or maybe a different perspective. I’ve been a wreck over this for whatever reason, but I love so hard when I like someone and maybe that’s the buzzkill? He is the same way though, or at least he was like this at the beginning.

Update on my cozy continued piece. (decided to include photo's as i'm not good at drawing) (i've also had a look and this is already nearly as long as my previous piece),slaytheprincess,1i9w3im,2025-01-25 15:24:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/slaytheprincess/comments/1i9w3im/update_on_my_cozy_continued_piece_decided_to/,Significant_Tie_3222,other,"""You're in an pillow dome, in a basement, and at the top of its staircase is the cabin. And sitting next to you is the princess. She's asleep, and you must do your best not to wake her. If you don't she'll be very sleepy throughout the rest of the day.""

Morning everyone!

**Morning already?**

*Last night was really fun! Hope the princess had a good time. Seems she did. Thanks for not forcing us to kill her by the way.*

""It's fine. As I said, I believe I was mistaken. I won't be going anywhere anytime soon but , i'll support whatever you two get up to""

Where's that plushy that we found earlier on?

**From what I remember we left it by the fridge.**

*Why are you waning to see it? If you don't mind me asking.*

Just since, when we were holding it last time I could have sworn that I had felt someone or something doing the same to us.

*Weird*

\*""\*Slowly laying the princess down making sure not to wake her you lay her down on the soft carpet. You turn towards the fridge. Noticing that your plushy has been accompanied by one that resembles the princess. Picking it up you notice the familiar warmth again. However due to your previous thoughts it's less a nostalgic glow, and more the feeling that you're in someone's warm hands. Squeezing it lightly you find that you become partly out of breath as the air is forced out of your lungs.""

Holy hell what happened?!?!?

**Did we do that?**

*I think it was us squeezing the plushy. I think we might be linked to it somehow. Makes me wonder if the princess is linked to hers as well.*

""You lean forward and lightly stroke the head of the princess's doll. From behind you hear the princess stir slightly in her sleep as if responding to an unseen stimulus.""

*It seems she is. That's strange. We should probably leave them in case we do something on accident.*

**We probably should. Wouldn't want to accidentally hurt her.**

Agreed. Also why are you being so quiet?

"".....Forgive me.""

Wait don't tell me...

""Picking up the two plushies you exit the dome and proceed towards the oven""

\[Resist\]

Why are you doing this?!??! I thought you had changed. I thought you were going to let us be happy together. I thought we didn't have to hurt each other anymore.

**I thought you were going to let us have fun for a change! We were so happy last night! Do you really want to take that from us?**

*I thought you had moved past you're previous goals. You said you were willing to let the world world end and that you wouldn't take our cherished moments from us. Was that all just a lie?*

""I'm sorry! I swear it wasn't. I hate that I have to go back on this. I thought all hope at saving the world was gone when the blade was rendered harmless and I had resigned myself to the consequences. But seeing this now. We still have a chance to save everyone. Please. I'm desperate""

""Quickly and silently you head towards the kitchen you turn the setting of the oven to the highest settings. You can already feel the heat emanating from its interior.""

\[Resist further\]

We have to do something. If he's wanting to kill the princess by throw in her plushy in here. I have an idea. But you may not like it.

*It's fine just think of anything! Quickly!*

I need you two to restrain him. Can you do that?

\[Both eepy and hero\] ***Got it!***

""What are you doing?!?! The world's on the line here. Wait. NO! You can't do that!""

Too late.

""Before I can make an attempt to correct your mistake you toss the princess's plushy behind you and your own into the oven. The pain is almost instant. Burns begin appearing over your body. The pain is too much for you to even stand""

This was the only thing we could do.

*You were going to kill the princess if we didn't do something.*

**Yeah. Didn't you see how nice she was? You can't let harm befall someone like her.**

""I'm sorry! You can understand me can't you? I didn't want to do this but it's the entire world that's on the line! I'm sorry! Im sorry!""

I think it might be a bit too late for that. I don't think we can hold out much longer anyway. We'll have to explain what happened when we get back. I hope she understands

*\[Both hero and eepy\] Yeah. Me too.*

*""I'm so sorry!""*

See you guys on the other side?

\[Both eepy and hero\] Yeah. We'll see you then.

**Chapter 3: The companion**

**""You're on a pa....""**

We're going to stop you right there. Boys! let's tie him up!

""What's the meaning of this?!?!?!""

*We already know about everything. About the cabin and the princess, and the looping every time we die.*

**And the fact that your a betraying, lying sack of crap!**

And before you say it. No we are **not** slaying her. We're leaving together.

\*\*""\*\*You're....... not slaying her? But she's a threat to the world! Everyone will die if she gets out! Including **you**. And the fact that you've been here means that her influence has most likely spread even further""

**You think that. But last time we were perfectly safe. Had a great  time together as well.**

I feel like this is not going anywhere. Could you just shove a sock or something in his mouth for a while?

*On it!*

\[proceed to cabin\]

How do you guys think we should explain what happened?

*Why don't you just tell her exactly what happened?*

**Would that involve telling her about us?**

*I guess so. But that shouldn't be too bad.*

I guess it shouldn't

\[Enter cabin\]

It's changed again.

*Yeah Most of those plushies have also disappeared too. The two of us are still here though. We should get rid of them before anything happens.*

*Agreed.*

***Dunno how but it seems like there's a hatch in the roof of the cabin. Why don't we hide them up there so nothing gets to them?***

Good idea!

\[Quiet has opened the hatch and entered the crawlspace above\]

*There's a padlock here as well. It's like the cabin is responding to our needs.*

They should be nice and safe up here though.

**Yeah. Nothing's harming em up here.**

\[Quiet has descended down the hatch and locked it tight with the padlock. They then proceed down the basement stairs\]

""**Is that you? Please come down, you left so suddenly. I really need to know why.""**

\[proceed down the stairs\]

(Upon seeing quiet the princess tears up and rushes towards him. Wrapping him in a warm embrace)

""**I'm really glad you're okay. You weren't there when I woke up. You weren't there and I saw what happened. Why? What happened?""**

\[outloud\] I'm really sorry for what happened, I wanted to leave with you once you had woken up but I really didn't have any other choice. I feel like you should know exactly what happened.""

""**I think i'd like that""**

Okay. So basically before we had first met. I had woken up in the forest. There was this voice telling me that I had needed to kill you. I don't know what his actual name is, but i've just always called him the narrator. But I never wanted to do that. I'd still never want to do that. There were other voices as well, 2 to be precise.""

""**Are these two other voices kind?""**

Very. Like me, they don't want to harm you either. Last time around it had appeared that even the narrator had changed. But once we had woken up it had turned out that it wasn't the case. You see, he believes that you're somehow a threat to the world.

""**A threat to the world?!?! But I don't want to hurt anyone. I like the world""**

I know you do. The other two, know you do. I never believed him from the start. You remember those plushies of ourselves that appeared last time around?

""**Yes""**

Well, it turned out that they sort of act like a voodoo doll of sorts, anything you do to them, happens to us.

""**So if i'm getting this right. You're saying that this ""narrator"" guy tried to destroy mine?""**

That's exactly what i'm trying to say. We couldn't let him do that so We had to try anything to get him to stop him. We really had no other choice than to burn our own. This time around the plushies were still here. So we decided to hide them far outside of our reach""

**""Thank you for that. I had no idea what had happened. I had just woken up to see your charred skeleton. I had no idea what to think. I do think locking the plushies away was the right idea though.""**

So you're not mad?

""**How could I be? You saved me after all!""**

I'm glad that went over well

**I'm just glad that she still likes us!**

""**You know how you said that you wanted to leave with me?""**

Yeah.

""**Well. I've always wanted to have the same. In fact i've prepared some bags for us. Should have all of the essentials that I know of""**

**\[In quiet's head\] There is only so much you can do in this basement. Even if it is fun. I'm down for this!**

*I'm on board with the plan as well. She's been down here for who knows how long. She should really see the outside world.*

\[Outloud\] You're really prepared! I don't know much about the outside myself to be honest. I've only ever been in the woods.

""**Then it's decided! Your bag is the one with the feather keychain""**

\*\*\[\*\*proceed back up the stairs\]

Are you okay? It seems like you're really nervous.

""**Yeah. I'm just nervous about what it'll be like. Like what if it's bad? But I think as long as i'm with you, it's all going to be okay""**

**\[exit the cabin\]**

\[In Quiet's Head\]

""Phleough! What're you doing? You can't just leave with her""

Yeah we know. The world is supposed to end. But take a look around you it's all still here.

""Wait. No. no no no no no. This can't be right. She's supposed to have ended the world. This isn't supposed to have been what happened.""

*But it is happening.*

Listen. You've been proven wrong about her. You can use this opportunity to get your bearings but in the mean time can you can describe things to us, okay?

""I suppose I have no other choice. As you look around at the outside world you find the princess doing the same. Her eyes wide and filled with a sense of awe and childlike wonder at the starry night above you, suddenly her attention is drawn to something up in the trees""

""**Look!!! It looks like you!""**

\*\*""\*\*Following her pointed finger you find that she's been pointing towards a bird resting on a branch on a tree nearby""

\[In quiet's head\]:

Do we really look like that?

*I mean we do have feathers*

**Why don't we ask her?**

\[Outloud\]

Do I really look like that? I don't think I've ever seen what I look like before.

""**You do kinda look like that. You're all feathery and you've also got wings! Can't tell if you have a beak or not though.""**

\[In head\]

**I guess we do look like that. Having wings is also news to me.**

\[outloud\]

I guess I must look like that. Didn't know I had wings though. That's neat!

""**I think it's cool as well! You also remind me of a big fluffy blanket!""**

You want to see what else is out there? I think we should probably head down the path I came here on.

""**Sounds like a plan!""**

""Progressing down the path the princess remains with the same childlike wonder she first portrayed. However she does seem to make an effort to remain close to your proximity. As you travel further the path you two are walking on seems to begin to branch off into separate paths, all of which seem to be fairly well traveled""

""**Seems we're getting close to something!""**

""Up ahead you find that the forest begins to become sparse emerging you see a large rolling country fields, over the horizon the sun begins to rise. Vibrant colours pouring over the horizons.""

Woah

""That's really pretty!""

""As you're looking out into the horizon you find that there's a building in the distance.""

Wonder what that building's used for?

""**Why don't we find out?""**

""It takes you some time, not that time is a thing to worry about. You and the princess trek across the country fields soaking in the surroundings as you do so""

""**The outside world really is magnificent""**

It really is

""Eventually you both make it to the building and head inside""

""Inside you find that it seems to house the entrance for a tourist attraction of some kind. There are others as well. You can't seem to see any that look like you, all of them seeming to have physical characteristics of the princess""

\[In quiet's head\]

This looks interesting. Wonder what""s being done here.

**Should we try to ask one of the people here?**

*I guess that'll be the most logical way of figuring things out*

\[outloud\]

""Approaching the counter you go over many things in your head. What question's do you ask? How do you greet them?. Approaching you find the individual stiffen up as they notice your approach.""

\[in quiet's head\]

**Are they okay? I hope we're not scaring them somehow**.

*Let's try to act natural*

\[outloud\]

Hi! Uh, I don't really get out much but me and my companion there (gestures to princess) just happened to see this building and was wondering what it's used for? Seems to be an attraction of some kind, from what I can guess.

""The individual behind the counter seems to relax after your introduction. Seemingly convincing them that you're not some kind of threat.""

(w) Uh... Well this building has been built over a large cave system. So in order to educate any potential visitors about the different landforms that can occur down there, we offer guided tours. Forgive me if I offended you for being a bit frightened at your appearance.

\[in quiet's head\]

***So that's what they were afraid of? Not that it offends me or anything.***

*Doesn't offend me either. I mean we don't even know what we look like ourselves.*

\[outloud\]

It's fine!  I don't think I've ever seen my own appearance to be honest. I have been told that I look like a bird though

(W) I would say that's an apt descriptor. I may have a solution for you since you say you've never seen yourself before

""As he says that he begins rummaging through some unseen compartment before producing a rectangular shaped device. Pressing a button, a flash occurs and from a receptacle at the bottom a small piece of paper is produced. The clerk then hands you the device and paper""

(W) I'll let you have this photo for free, I'll let you have a look at the camera as well. If you decide to buy a ticket for your friend and yourself come and notify me. You'll get to hold on to the camera if you purchase tickets as well as they're included.

\[In Quiet's head\]

So that's what it's called!

*Should we have a look at ourselves?*

**I'd really want to!**

""Flipping the piece of paper over in your hand, you gaze upon yourself for the first time. You find that the princess was right in her description. Looking back up at you are a pair of snow white eyes set on top of a feathered head. The ret of your body seems to be humanoid although you can't overly tell as it seems to be largely covered by two large feathered wings. The most puzzling characteristic though is what seems to be a large beak filled with teeth. Although it does seem like its presence alters every time you look at it.""

Wait. So that's what we look like?!?!

**I mean she** ***did*** **say we looked like a bird.**

*She did. But I would still consider it a bit of a surprise to see it for ourselves*

""As you're analysing your photograph the princess seems to have finished looking around and notices what you're doing. Quickly stepping up to see what exactly you're looking at""

""**What're you looking at?""**

The person behind the desk used this \[holds up camera\] to take a photo of me. Just intrigued by it as I've never seen myself before. They say we can get it included if we buy a ticket to the tours they're offering.

""**I can see why you're fascinated by this! Wait. Can you try it on me?""**

**""**As she says this she backs up a few steps in order for you to get a full view. Remembering when the worker took your own photo you raise up the camera and press the button located on the top. The flash goes off, startling the princess a little. However she comes back up and pulls the photo free from its producer""

""**Woah... That is cool! You said we can own this if we buy a ticket? I'm on board if that's what you're going to be asking me.""**

Then I guess it's decided!

\[To the worker\]

Hi! I'd like to get a ticket for me and my good friend here.

(w) Okay so here you go and have a good time!

Anyone with Adhd? I need help,Tunisia,1i9w32n,2025-01-25 15:23:38,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1i9w32n/anyone_with_adhd_i_need_help/,Puzzleheaded_Sort_36,Question/Help,"Hi, so long story short, I found out I have Adhd, I've always suspected that something was wrong with me since the age of 11 but I never acted upon any of those feelings until a a couple of months, I was watching some YouTube video that talked about it (like symptoms and all) and by the end of it, i was like ""what a coincidence I have those too"" but before you say anything, NO a youtube video is not why i think i have a mental health disorder, finish reading the rest of the story first before you make any judgement,
So i started looking things up online about the condition and everything and i even took a couple of online tests and all of them said that i have it, but again, obviously I wasn't going to trust a self diagnosis w nrakabha l ro7i, it could've been my fucked up attention span for watching all those yt shorts for all i know, but the feelings of uncertainty and the thought of what if it's true never went away
Because like i said earlier this shit is not new, i first noticed it in middle school 7th grade 
(Im 23 rn btw).
so about a week ago, a psy or a therapist (idk i didnt pay attention) payed a visit to our uni as part of like mental health awareness week or smth idk 
I ended up getting a one on one with him and told him everything from start to finish and after basically 40mn of talking, he confirmed it to me and referred me to another person who can give me an official diagnosis and help me heal 
BUuuuuuuuuuut here's the thing 
It's EXPENSIVE ASF, and I'm BROKE ASF 
the Person he referred me to, they charge 220 tnd per session and i dont have health insurance for shit like this
Also adhd when it comes to adults you need multiple sessions to be given an official diagnosis and they make sure you're not faking it or idk some bullshit like that 
So I'm saying all this for one reason only, i need help
How can you help me, simple?
If there's anyone who's Adhd, help me buy meds for it, I'll pay you and you buy it for me (you need to be officially diagnosed to buy it)
Or at the very least, allow me to try one of yours just to if it fixes me or not 
That's pretty much it so if anyone can help me id really appreciate it
Ps: sorry for my english, its shit ik but i can't express myself as well as i do in it, in Arabic 
Ps2:also before you even say it, my family doesn't know and even if they did, it wouldn't matter because 1)they don't believe in mental health and they'd probably mock me for it,  make fun of me and  call me mahboul w mgarba3 2) we're barely middle class, they can't afford of it and neither can i cause I'm still in uni and don't have a job "

The team and community are still as active as ever every day, making banger memes and dominating attention.  
  
All while ETH has experienced the worst FUD it ever has and seen intense price depression in relation to its peers.  
  
The ETH narrative is changing.  The amount of ETH that World Liberty is buying up is a clear indication of the direction that policy is going to go in the USA.  Top ETH betas are likely to receive massive tail winds from any bullish ETH news coming from the current administration.  
  
Coinbase is ramping up their base advertising and working hard to bring the world to their L2.  Again MOG stands to benefit heavily from this being one of the biggest tokens available on base and the cheapest coin on coinbase.  
  
On the speculative side, MOG stands one of the best chances of addition to [u/RobinhoodApp](https://x.com/RobinhoodApp) and [@binance](https://x.com/binance) spot.

Are you on the Hype defi train?,defi,1i9vz0d,2025-01-25 15:18:38,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1i9vz0d/are_you_on_the_hype_defi_train/,ma6ic,:strategy: DeFi Strategy,"I haven't seen much posted about DeFi or Hyperliquid in this sub, so hoping this reaches some new eyes. There are returns on stablecoin yield that blow traditional finance out of the water.

Hyperliquid is a spot and perpetuals exchange that lets any user deposit USDC into their market maker and earn APR based on user demand. It's been 27% for the last month and reaches 30% regularly. It ranges between 20-30% mostly.

That is crazy value for stablecoin yield and there is only a 4-day lockup after each deposit, so the unstaking is pretty liquid.

There's a lot of great coin recommendations in the this sub, but I've seen very little on HYPE, which is a massive opportunity. It's a newer coin with a rabid userbase who is mostly just not on Reddit. Here's a little background on Hyperliquid just for context.

Hyperliquid really made a name for itself in 2024 with what was basically the biggest airdrop of all time—over $10 billion worth of tokens dropped directly to the community. From day one, it attracted a ton of users who tried it, loved it, and ended up building an insanely tight-knit community. People even created supporting products like HypurrFun, pvp.trade, and HypurrScan to build around it.

At the core, Hyperliquid’s tech just *worked* as a good perp DEX should:

* It handled high trading volumes even when the markets were all over the place.
* Spreads were tight, and the liquidity for alts was better than most.
* Just overall, it was smooth and profitable to trade there compared to other platforms.

But what made it stand out was how creative it got:

* Vaults let regular users step into roles like market makers or liquidators (normally reserved for big players).
* Deposits didn’t just sit there—they earned yield and added to liquidity depth.
* A portion of liquidation fees went back into those vaults, which was a win for users.

They also introduced HLP, where users could benefit from both trading *and* contributing to the platform’s liquidity. It was designed to make everyone an active part of the ecosystem.

Oh, and let’s not forget that airdrop—310 million tokens (\~$10 billion in HYPE liquidity). It was on another level, to the point that it created this huge initial push for adoption.

The tokenomics? Super healthy. No VC allocations, no paid market makers. All the fees are reinvested back into the product to benefit users, which is pretty rare.

And this is just the beginning. Hyperliquid isn’t just a DEX—they’re building out an entire ecosystem with dApps on their HyperEVM, a high-performance chain with HyperBFT consensus that keeps everything familiar for developers.

Also, the way they’ve grown is wild. No VC funding. No big marketing campaigns. Everything has been completely community-driven. They basically bootstrapped their way into becoming one of the most talked-about platforms out there.

TLDR: Hyperliquid dropped a killer product that’s both profitable and fun to use, created an ecosystem where the community actually benefits, and kicked it all off with an insane airdrop that got everyone’s attention. Seems like they’re just getting started."

I encourage all investors to maintain their current investment positions by holding for the long term, particularly those with significant holdings, we have the potential to realize substantial returns.

As you may have observed, many recently launched tokens are pumped and dumped within minutes and experience significant price fluctuations, often with rapid increases followed by sharp declines. 

By maintaining our current investment positions and demonstrating unwavering confidence, we contribute to a more stable and sustainable ecosystem for the project. This inspires trust among new community members and attracts new investors.

I am confident that once the token is migrated to the Raydium platform, it will attract significant attention over time, provided that holders of substantial positions maintain their investments. This long-term commitment from ""key stakeholders"" will be instrumental in building confidence and fostering sustained growth within the project."
Toxic coworkers/friends (26 F and 28F) are back in my (28 F) life and I don’t know how to handle this,friendship,1i9vvox,2025-01-25 15:14:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1i9vvox/toxic_coworkersfriends_26_f_and_28f_are_back_in/,xxcheekycherryxx,advice,"



So here’s the situation: I’m a 28-year-old woman, and I work with two people who I used to consider close friends—let’s call them R (26F) and T (28F). Things have been weird with them lately, and I’m just done.

We had a bit of a fallout, but let me give you some backstory:

Work trip which turned out to be not a work trip at all:
They invited me VERY last minute for a work trip, and I thought, “Cool, let’s go.” Big mistake. Once I got there, they completely ignored me. They treated me like I wasn’t even there, posted pics with their other guy friend, but none with me. I was left out, plain and simple. They’d go to all these work events, leave me on the spot, go mingle with other people, and when they saw me later they’d be like “oh where were you?”. In fact what broke my heart is we were all drinking in my room the first night and I closed my eyes for a bit and laid down on the bed. They probably thought I’m sleeping. I heard T making fun of me and making humiliating comments and even worse this “guy friend” of theirs joining in. 

Bali:
After a few months of separating myself and getting back together again, we decided to go to Bali. Things got even worse there. They treated me like a sidekick, always walking ahead and leaving me to trail behind, even when I tried to catch up. If I stayed behind to take pictures, they didn’t even bother to wait for me. They made fun of me for eating local food, while they refused to try anything. And don’t get me started on the boy-crazy behavior. They left me alone every time guys approached me. In one beach club, I was literally alone for an hour while they were off flirting. It made me feel like I didn’t matter. If I got any attention, T would shut it down with backhanded comments. Basically, they were so focused on themselves that they couldn’t care less about me, and honestly, it felt like they didn’t even like me.

After all this, I distanced myself again. I didn’t reach out, stopped trying to make plans, and honestly, I just wanted to get away from all the toxicity. It felt like they were using me when it was convenient and then ignoring me when they didn’t need anything. So, I did what anyone would do—cut ties.

Out of nowhere, they started talking to me again a few days back, adding me back to the WhatsApp group. It’s like nothing ever happened. They’re now going out with other coworker/friends, posting pictures of their little hangouts, and I can’t help but feel hurt. I thought I’d moved on, but it’s hard when they’re acting like we’re all cool again while I’ve been left out of everything else.

I’m angry, jealous, and honestly, confused. I feel like I’ve been replaced with whoever’s more convenient, and now they’re acting like nothing happened. It just feels so hurtful. Now here’s where I’m stuck —I don’t know if I should even entertain this anymore. I don’t have any other friends, and these two are still coworkers, so I have to face them. But what does this sudden change in behavior mean? And how should I approach it?

Do I just keep my distance and pretend everything’s fine, or do I confront them and ask where their loyalty actually lies? Do I just stay distant and keep working with them as coworkers without getting emotionally involved again?"
someone explain please,Crushes,1i9vs4l,2025-01-25 15:10:13,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1i9vs4l/someone_explain_please/,Life_Lime7290,DoTheyLikeMe? ,"I like this guy and have liked him for a few months already. He's very outgoing and not really the shy type, he basically knows what he wants pretty much. On top of that, he is really funny and smart.

Well, I noticed in group settings-me, him, and our friends he is basically the center of attention, initiating convo with almost everyone in the group. However, when it is us two, his behavior becomes more mellow and calm around me. Whenever we do talk, he doesn't really make eye contact unless I make the eye contact first, it's like I see a completely different side of him when the average person at our school sees him as outgoing and energetic. To add on, when he is walking with another girl, he is still that same energetic type, when walking with me to class though he talks to me in a more relaxed tone. 

Anyways, one of my friends says he likes me but I don't really see it. I might be in denial but at this point it is getting confusing for me. "

some girl tried to “overpay” for my nfr giraffe,AdoptMeRBX,1i9vrf7,2025-01-25 15:09:24,5,0.78,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdoptMeRBX/comments/1i9vrf7/some_girl_tried_to_overpay_for_my_nfr_giraffe/,reqlve,✔ Rant ⛌,"i was playing on my laptop, so i don’t have screenshots. i did take a video scrolling through the chat, but i can’t blur usernames in the video so won’t be able to post it.

basically i was playing with my sister, working together to find the shooting stars around the map. i had found all of them and she’d found about half of them, so i was letting her do her thing and i was doing some tasks to bring age up pots with my giraffe. i will say, i would consider myself rich. not mega bat dragon, mega shadow dragon, mega frost dragon, all that kind of rich, but i have lots of neon legendaries including a high tiers, and just a lot of neons and megas. my profile reflects that, and also says “none of my neons or megas are for trade unless otherwise stated.” as we’re all VERY familiar with, people cannot and will not read, and try to offer for NFT pets all the flipping time. 

so i’m doing tasks, i’m at the fire hydrant behind the toy shop, letting my giraffe… do his business… and all of a sudden this girl appears tomorrow. she then pulls out an owl, rides it, and then runs around me in circles. now, i have my trades off so that’s important to know. she then gets right in my face and says “trade.” i ask why and she goes “i have a good offer.” so for shits and giggles, i trade her. my giraffe is always nft but i’ll see offers i guess, what’s the harm in that? plus i know i can’t fall victim to the trade freezing hacks as my giraffe is locked so i can’t even add it to a trade.

so anyways, she puts the FR owl in, then added 2 aussie eggs, a fossil egg, then she added a danger egg only to take it out. she added a monkey box, a regal chest, and i think 2 ride potions. as one does, i said “sorry nty” and declined the trade. she started sending a bunch of tagged messages in chat, so i can only imagine she was cussing me out ofc. then she said, “why did you decline? i was over.” i had made my way to the playground at this point, but whipped around so fast and went back over to her behind the toy shop again. for reference, a FR owl isn’t even worth 100 on elve, i think around 97.5, and a NFR giraffe is 416 i believe. i looked it up at the time to let her know she was, in fact, NOT over at all, but i’m not positive i remember correctly rn so i may be off by a few. 

by this point, my sister had come over and was telling the girl that she was really under and all that. i said something like “your FR owl is 97.5 on elve and my giraffe is 416, so mine is over 4 times your pet’s value sorry” and she just got so mad😭 she started sending more tagged messages and then said “but my owl is FR and i put a lot of out of game eggs and stuff.” my sister said “yeah she already said it was FR” and i told her the stuff she added, while out of game, didn’t even come close to making up the value. i’m not trying to be mean but oh my gosh she kept insisting she was over. after all that she started calling my sister and i “f@t” and that i had no friends and spent my whole life grinding the game lol. i’ve had so many 
weird/annoying/stupid trade encounters but this one was something else. sorry for the long story, hard to explain everything without chat screenshots lol"
Dress form restauration: I fixed my DIY foam dressform,sewing,1i9vr44,2025-01-25 15:09:02,51,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vr44,xliieesss,Project: Non-clothing,"Three years ago (I think), I made a DIY dressform based on the steps from [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iOPYhH6YHpQ?si=ndErxdWhNfdQOrDf). In short: I had myself covered in plaster to make a mold, which we then filled with a two part epoxy foam.

Since then, I experienced quite some shrinkage on the dressform. I don't know what exactly caused this, could have been sun or unproper mixing. No clue. Everything above the breast stayed intact, the rest shrunk. Especially the under the breast area, as you can see on the photos. 

Between her shrinkage and a few added centimeters on my part, the difference in for example the waist was about 10 cm/4 inches. :(

Today I finally took on the task of giving her some more body. I had a bag of batting/fiberfill from a stool restauration, which I ended up using for the added 'floof'. I didn't really have a set plan, and basically draped and pinned as i went, using the waistline and side of the dress form as my guides. 
After pinning i lightly stitched the pieces together, and finally sewed the cover closed again. 

Since the shoulder section didn't shrink I only gave her extra shape in the form of a sleeveless dress. You can sorta see the line where the batting ends through the cover, but honestly I don't really mind. 
And I actually like her better than before now. You can't see the imperfections from the foam anymore, and the dress form feels really soft. And still pinnable! "
Insomnia While tested for Narcolepsy,Narcolepsy,1i9vqhy,2025-01-25 15:08:15,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1i9vqhy/insomnia_while_tested_for_narcolepsy/,BraveBed4430,Undiagnosed,"Hi, I know this is long & I’m sorry if any of this sounds dramatic. I recently 10/24 had a really rough go with insomnia- things I tried did not work(basic sleep hygiene, zzzquil, Xanax, seroquel, ambien. ) I would fall asleep and then wake up two hours later. Finally I saw a neurologist who understood what I was talking about- he wrote me amitriptyline and at a low dose I was able to fall asleep again. Although lately it has been feeling like it is taking longer to work & I don’t feel super rested compared to no sleep it’s a huge blessing. I also spoke to him about potentially having narcolepsy, as I’ve had fatigue, sleep paralysis over 100 times, and cataplexy (which I didn’t know was a thing for a long time- I thought everybody had funny hands) the cataplexy was mainly as a young child/very rare teenage & seldom as much in adulthood. 

Due to insurance issues, I was never able to meet the sleep neuro yet- however luckily I scored getting into a sleep study- which was yesterday.

Well, off the bat it started out rough. Arrived at 7:45/8pm- When I mentioned I brought my sleep apnea machine the tech said no your doctor did not write this, you cannot use this, & the first test is for sleep apnea if you have it bad you will fail for the second part. This was very frusturating as I already know I have sleep apnea, & the whole reason I went was to be tested for narcolepsy as that is what I believed was causing insomnia. When I mentioned I was having insomnia recently he had said you would not have insomnia with narcolepsy. 

Anyways I go to try to sleep, and it’s not going well. I recently found out I have PCOS & sometimes it feels like it’s pressing on my bladder & I have to pee. I didn’t want to bother the tech so I would try to reposition myself but I ended up having him undo the wires like legit 8 times so I could use the restroom. I was hella stressed thinking about how if I don’t get 6 hours I won’t be able to do the second test & also being hooked up to wires in a hospital room was stressful as my ex died a little over a year ago & spent two weeks in a hospital hooked up to similar wires so I was overthinking everything.

Around 5am I said I should just go home, We already know I didn’t make the 6 hour requirement for sleep to do next test. I was constantly moving around trying to get comfortable for my bladder and it felt like the part of my brain that drifts off to sleep would not kick in. The tech had me stay another hour and when I was packing up to leave he said the test showed I don’t have sleep apnea or narcolepsy. I said how could you even test for apnea if I didn’t sleep? He said well you slept a little. If you had narcolepsy you would have been able to sleep 6 hours, they fall asleep super easy. If this were pre-Insomnia that wouldn’t have been an issue but Ok whatever.

My question is- can the sleep Neuro detect narcolepsy while I was having insomnia during the polysomnography test? I am so scared I blew my chance bc of stress/insomnia that the tech was right and it didn’t show & my insurance will not cover a second test now after waiting & spending money to do this. I have heard they can do a spinal tap for certain chemicals for narcolepsy & at this point I just want to get an answer, I could deal with fatigue/sleep paralysis bc compared to insomnia it’s not as bad. I am worried if I don’t get proper diagnosis the next time insomnia hits I won’t make it thru & most doctors don’t understand.

Any insight on this topic would be greatly appreciated- if anyone has gone thru this or had gotten tested with insomnia and failed, did you find out later you did have narcolepsy, or maybe something else. I still need to meet with sleep neuro I’m just waiting for referral from a new primary.  Thanks you guys."

I kindly asked her if she truly believes in Jesus and his teachings. She obviously said yes. I then told her that then she should stick to her faith and not let it be shaken by the politics of the world. This is a matter of her spiritual wellbeing. Her not attending church doesn't ""send a message to the Pope"" it only hurts herself. I also told her that the Washington Post isn't a direct source from the Vatican and should really be checking what was actually said (she brought up some other things that were, in fact, the media spinning it out of proportion). I reassured her that all she can do it pray in these hard times and sent her on her way. 

Now to take the polite, customer service, good little Christian mask off for a sec, I can't fucking stand these people and their lack on conviction or moral understanding. ""That's just not right!"" What's not right about speaking up against someone who is trying to destroy the very foundation of this country? What's not right speaking about showing basic dignity and respect to your fellow man? What's actually not right, and what the Bible actually preaches is about letting corrupt religious leaders silence people preaching a gossip of peace and understanding. The Pharisees hates him for daring to hold them accountable and shake up the status quo but no one nowadays wants to hear that! No one what's to remember that the Good Samaritan would have been an outcast and hated but was the only one who did the right thing. If Jesus was here in the modern day he would have used an illegal immigrant to get his point across. No one what's to remember how it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven. Funny how they forget that verse when praising the godhead Elon or his high priest Trump. Almost everything in the New Testament especially would show how Trump is the farthest thing from being any kind of ""Christian"" leader. He is corrupt. He is uncaring. He is greedy. He is prideful. He is someone more Christian should be calling out and shunning, but no. Most Christians are only ""Christian"" in name and not in actions. Fuck them. Fuck every single one of them. I'm still here out of spite, so I can throw everything they've ever taught me right back at them. To make them actually pay attention to what they claim to believe. "

All they seem to comment is that I “don’t respect my husbands wishes.” Little do they know that I do literally everything based on how he feels. As well as none of them wanted to actually read what I posted because well I guess they literally don’t have the attention span to read. So here I am. Not wanting to be attacked or accused of being a pos wife.


Second chances.

Needing serious advice since I’ve never been in this position before. And I’m trying to prevent a fight/argument. As the title states I’m thinking my friend deserves a second chance after years of no contact. But my husband won’t talk about it and if we do he’s pissy.


Okay so this is gonna be a bit long, but I’ve got no idea how else to shorten it for my reason for thinking a second chance is okay. So my cousin and I had been best friends and attached at the hip since she was born (one year apart) to the point where everyone thought we were sisters because we look alike, talk the same, like we honestly felt like we should have been siblings rather than our brothers. Fast forward time, At this point we’ve been attached for 26yrs. I’ve dated some really shitty people and she’s always been there for me. She starts dating this guy 15 yrs OLDER than her. And right off the bat I didn’t like him. He wouldn’t allow her to post on any socials that they were together. (Which was when I flipped because the dudes hiding her!) she started smoking pot HEAVILY with this guy because that’s all he wanted to do while constantly promising they’d be getting a place together eventually. But here’s the kicker!! He still lived with his “ex wife” who he wasn’t divorced from and that it’s “for the boys and not to confuse them.” So in my mind, if he’s living with his “ex” for the boys, what else is he doing to make it seem like everything’s fine to the boys? 🤔 And I would tell her all the time he’s using her. They couldn’t be seen in public. You know, ALL THE RED FLAGS!! And I kept telling her he was using her and he started manipulating her. Making her think one thing about me saying stuff he “overheard me and my bf were talking about.” Things that were NEVER said. My bf and I had talked about looking for a place to move to because where we were at was really dangerous (neighbor literally got shot in her face. 🙃) she knew we were looking and I said IF I found something I’d pay my part of the bills two months in advance so she could find a place/roommate instead of signing the lease again. Well instead I woke up to loud banging and here…SHES MOVING OUT!! On my birthday. She said nothing to me. When I messaged her she wasn’t even there. He was moving everything (even took the food, my AC, etc.) and she said “since you want me gone anyway I figured I’d beat you to it.” Thus ending our friendship. I was CRUSHED. Like. Bad breakup type of crushed. And my bf was there the whole time. And I cried so much. And told him how messed up she had been and that she wasn’t acting herself and he said how we don’t truly know somebody. 


Fast forward:
My mom tells me she left that guy a few years ago and seems to be doing well. She sent my mom a looooooong message explaining everything. How she’s so regretful. She hates herself. She hates herself for believing he was telling the truth. Apparently he told her that my bf and I were talking about packing up in the middle of the night and I stated that I couldn’t stand her anymore. (I have NEVER EVER even thought about not liking her.) And he told her that he’d get a place for them (her, him and her kid.) So he finds a place, moves her out, tells her to stay at the apartment and he will move all the stuff out so I don’t try to fight and “hurt her more.” And then once it’s all done and over with he doesn’t move in. Gives excuses, tells her he will once he “figures stuff out.” So eventually she realizes he’s lying and I was telling her the truth. She said how she was never in an abusive relationship like I have so she should have listened to me. 

Now I have missed her so much. And I wanna talk to her. But anytime I talk to my then bf, now husband about it. He gets so pissy. And he’s stated before that friends don’t do what she did and he doesn’t want me to get hurt again. I get it. But it was MY relationship. And I genuinely think she’s genuine with what she tells my mom. And I do feel like people deserve a second chance (obviously some things and people don’t deserve it.) I don’t have any friends outside of work. I have him and our kid. And he doesn’t either (we work a lot and I’m also in school.) and we aren’t the type that need to be hanging with people. But he has his brother who is to him, what she was to me. I’m just at a loss. I want her in my life again but I don’t want it to cause us issues. And I’ve been trying so hard to think of how to bring it up to him and convince him that she deserves a chance to explain to me everything. Mind you, I’ve given him chances before with some things and the petty side of me wants to bring up old shit and remind him of it. But then the other part of me is saying I shouldn’t. Also, it’s not like the moment we’d start talking we would make plans to hang out, I’d wanna start slow by just talking.

So advice on how to bring it up without a fight?  (Mind you the fights are just him having an attitude and then saying “do whatever the hell you want.” which we all know means the total opposite with a tone like that!) 
Does she deserve a second chance or am I just being “too nice” as my husband says I always am?

So IF you have made it this far….Thank you so much. And please. Only serious answers/advice. My birthday is coming up, I miss her, and I miss having a girl friend to talk to but I’m also not a guy to understand why he’d be so mad over such things.."

My [28F] boyfriends new job [28M] is hurting our relationship,relationship_advice,1i9vjvu,2025-01-25 15:00:21,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9vjvu/my_28f_boyfriends_new_job_28m_is_hurting_our/,sad-gf_throwaway,,"
I [28F] have been dating my now boyfriend [28M] for a little over 3 months. We started talking around 5 months ago, but only made it official in October. Warning in advance for the length of this post - I am autistic and have a really hard time condensing details. TLDR at the bottom. 

When we started the relationship, it was a dream. We both want the same lifestyle, work toward marriage and a family, me AuDHD and him ADHD, both highly creative, both high achievers with many hobbies. We would have these extremely interesting conversations about special areas of knowledge, multi-paragraph texts, teaching each other about our hobbies, a lot of mutual flirtation and chemistry. Talking to him was the best part of my day and I would genuinely look forward to hearing from him, we took our own time and space but the time we did share was very high quality. He’s the only man I’ve ever found intellectually challenging enough to make me deeply interested. We would exchange 10-15 high quality messages per day, and see each other 1-2x per week for dates (driving out to the beach, trying new restaurants, laying in the park and talking for hours, going for walks around town to check out local businesses). He paid for a few dates in the very beginning to be gentlemanly, and then we quickly worked to a good 50/50 split, taking turns spoiling each other. Our communication is above average and our emotional connection is very deep. 

In the beginning, he would always insist that he wanted to see me as much as possible - if I ever needed him, I should ask and he would be there in a heartbeat. He would tell me, without me asking, that he wanted to support me and that taking care of me was his privilege (we both have physical disabilities that cause a lot of pain, and this sentiment was mutual). I felt extremely secure in the relationship, very supported, understood, desired and genuinely happy. 

Around November, he was settling in at a new job working 9-5 and at the same time he moved back in with his parents (more on that later). At first, the job didn’t seem to affect things - we still had our date nights, we would text here and there throughout the workday, still very thoughtful conversations. However, around this time his pain condition started to flare up and our sex life was impacted. Previously, we were very compatible - without going into things too much, he was an enthusiastic pleasure dom and I am the perfect counterpart to that (our size difference really plays into the dynamic, as I am very petite and he is above average height and build). He knew there were certain things I didn’t prefer to do in the bedroom due to trauma, and insisted he would not miss or need those things at all. After his pain started kicking in, he would increasingly ask me for these things, getting to the point of a complete role reversal where I was the one servicing 95% of the time and he would just lay back. This became hard on me physically because of our size difference, I would get dizzy and exhausted during, and I stopped enjoying our sex. Aftercare was lacking, when previously it was great. I can’t lie, he got a little bit lazy, and put on an amount of weight in a short period of time after starting the job which I think contributed to this change. I have never commented on his weight or feeling he was being lazy, but I did have an honest conversation about how my experience had been impacted. He recognized the change, acknowledged it and worked toward improvements. I acknowledged his recent increase in pain, and came up with solutions that worked for both of us. This was enough at the time, but marks the beginning of the changes I’ve seen since starting this new job. 

Around December, I noticed he had stopped planning dates for us and all the compliments and bids for my time were disappearing. Our hang outs became routine, with him coming to my house to sleep over every weekend by default. At only 2 months, this felt really soon to be settling into a routine. I felt he had gotten too comfortable too fast, especially since we had multiple mutual conversations in the early stages about how relationships should be a consistent effort, and how losing the desire to impress your partner would inevitably lead to the death of the relationship. We had talked at length about these things and both enthusiastically agreed that it was important to us to have an intentional and passionate relationship. Our messages became mostly sexting, and mostly possessive or degrading. We share some mutual kinks surrounding these things, and while we enjoy them in bed, I felt for a while that I was being reduced to an object of possession both in and out of the bedroom. I had another honest conversation about this, where I expressed my feelings - I reaffirmed that I do still enjoy our spicy conversations, but I just needed more of that initial romance and general emotional cherishing I used to get from him, along with more intellectual conversation. At this point, I was catering to him a lot and almost exclusively compromising myself for our relationship. I wanted to be patient and pull my weight in the relationship. 

After this conversation, he essentially stopped talking to me about sex and stopped flirting whatsoever, outside of when I would initiate. (I would come to find out later that he took what I asked for way too far and became afraid to even mention sex, for worry of it upsetting me. He ignored the part where I said I love our spicy conversations but need more of the other stuff, and just cut out the spice altogether.) Now I was not receiving the romantic affirmation I needed, and also not receiving any sexual attention either. I tried to improve things by stepping up and planning dates, and really attempting to make the holiday season special. I started paying for a lot more of our dates, buying him nice gifts (Dior cologne, David Yurman bracelet), arranging our dates (intimate underground concert, holiday light shows, zoo, dinner dates) and complimenting him more. I started initiating most of our sexual interactions as well, and even leaned harder into some of his interests to assure his pleasure. For the month of December, I felt that I was leading the relationship and replacing his efforts as the masculine partner. I felt a great impact to my ability to be feminine and lean into the relationship emotionally, needing to put him before myself to keep things afloat. 

Because I am autistic, I don’t know exactly where to draw the line on these things and I thought what I was doing was helpful, not wanting to uphold patriarchal expectations, wanting to support him and give him a break. I wanted to show that I care about the relationship enough to step up. Throughout all of this, I considered that he may be losing interest in me or pulling away, and I really gently and amicably asked him if he thought time away from the relationship would be helpful. I regularly open space for feedback and dialogue in our relationship, and our communication is really above average (at least on my part). The entire time, he has insisted that he is extremely in love with me, finds no fault in me as a partner,  is lucky to be with me, sees me as his future wife and mother of his children, wants to spend all his time with me, etc. However he keeps noticing himself falling short. 

We come back to the “taking care” part of things that was previously insisted upon. In the end of December, he got sick and I took care of him for the weekend - such good care that he recovered in 2 days. I have a lot of experience with caregiving and know how to meet needs without being asked. Later in the same week, I caught the illness he had and it turned out to be Covid. I became much more sick than he was, and he said he would come take care of me. The entire time he was “taking care of” me, I did not feel taken care of - I had to ask him to get me medicine, to get us food, to help me with every little thing. When he was sick, I paid for all of the medicine and food. When I was sick, I offered to pay for things and he accepted my money rather than insisting on returning the favor. This all left me questioning whether I could picture a future with someone I didn’t fully trust to take care of me. I was sick for almost 2 weeks and spent most of that alone with no help, and lost out on a lot of income from work (I am self employed in a high earning arts industry). 

Throughout all of this, I have been supporting myself independently, running a successful business, having my own house (rented with one housemate in a HCOL area), performing 90% of house chores (I have an agreement with my housemate, who pays more rent in exchange as he is terrible at cleaning), taking care of two animals (one of them being recently diagnosed with diabetes, requiring a lot of extra care and $$$), and I have been bending over backwards to make my relationship work. I have zero family involvement in my life due to childhood abuse, and have been on my own since 17. I spend all of my free time on adulting, improving my business, caring for my animals, caring for my home, exercising and cooking, etc. 

He, on the other hand, has full family support from a very wealthy family. When we met, he was working part time hours in a recreational field doing a very expensive hobby he enjoys. He has no pets, no dependents. He had an apartment when we met, but moved back home when his lease was up (which I encouraged, to put extra money toward his student loans). He has no obligations outside of work, does not contribute financially to his household, and only does a few chores here and there when asked. He spends his free time golfing, surfing, and working on various hobby projects involving 3D modeling, laser etching, sculpting etc. 

In January, my workplace (studio space, contracted) was going through a lot of changes and the owner put a lot of work onto me that  is not my responsibility, along with some other work stressors. My already full plate became overflowing, and my physical disability worsens with cold weather. I hit the wall and burn out badly, with autistic burnout, and physical symptoms. I have a condition (MCAS) that causes allergic reactions in response to severe stress. While going through all of this, I have never been demanding of my partner’s time or attention, but when it got so bad that I was worried I may need medical attention I broke down and asked him to be here for me. His response was to pull away, tell me his work had been really impacting his time and energy, and that I should seek an outside third party for help. I expressed actual severe and pressing personal needs to him ONE time, and he shut down. I told him I was so burnt out and overwhelmed, I felt like I was drowning, breaking out in hives, and having serious heart issues. All I asked him to do was come over and be with me and provide some comfort. He did eventually come over, but he caused more distress than help, just sitting near me and staring at me. Somehow I ended the day taking care of him and giving him a 45 minute massage because his shoulder pain had been bothering him. I looked around at the house uncleaned, chores undone, myself having ordered and paid for dinner for us, not having felt my stress relieved in the slightest and felt something break. I no longer trusted this man could be a life partner. If one 9-5 job with no other obligations was enough to render him nearly useless, unable to provide basic support or care, unable to engage in conversation as we used to, unable to provide reassurance or any amount of romance to our relationship… how could he possibly handle building a family together? 

The reason I am here asking for advice is because I don’t know how to trust my own intuition, being autistic and having different thought patterns. I want to be reasonable and I’m afraid my standards will leave me alone for the rest of my life, as I’ve never met a partner who could match my effort and thoughtfulness. I end up feeling hurt constantly by the lack of effort I feel from people who claim they love me, and this is a pattern. I need to highlight the good things he’s done that give me pause:

When I bring my concerns to him, we have reasonable conversations. It takes him longer to come to an understanding, but he has never raised his voice or gotten angry and he lets me speak and never talks over me. He ways acknowledges my feelings and makes what seem like genuine promises to put effort and do better. 

He has converted on feedback I’ve given in the past. He always opens my car door, he has bought me flowers a handful of times, he adjusted things in the bedroom to meet my needs again, he makes attempts to spend time when he is tired (setting up video game nights to play over discord). 

He puts in the time and effort to drive to me more often than I drive to him, a roughly 30-45min drive, because I really dislike driving. He drives us when we are together. 

He made plans for a nice dinner date for us, although it took a month and was canceled at the last minute due to ICE raids impacting the restaurant, he attempted and put a lot of thought into planning a romantic thing. 

He has made me thoughtful little gifts with his skills, some that took a good amount of time and some money. He made me a necklace from sea glass we collected together, a music box with a song from one of my favorite Ghibli films, a paper version of my favorite flower, a specialized piece of equipment related to my work, a hand sculpted jewelry bowl when he heard me say I had nowhere to put my rings. Though most of these happened in the first 2 months when things were good, he has shown he has the ability to execute a level of thoughtfulness with these that far exceeds any other man I’ve been involved with.  

He has been there for me in the beginning in ways that are vital to my life, washing my hair for me when the nerve pain in my hands was too severe, brushing my hair out for me, bringing me food when I was in too much pain to leave my bed. 

I am deeply conflicted because through all of this, I genuinely believe that he has the ability to be such a thoughtful and caring partner. It’s just in recent months, his actions have made me feel incredibly neglected and even abandoned at times. He insists his feelings have only grown stronger and none of this is because he’s pulled away or become less interested, but that it’s all because he is tired from his work. We barely speak or see each other beyond the routine “good morning, did you eat lunch, how was your day, don’t stay up too late” etc. Now on the weekends, he isn’t looking forward to seeing me, he is taking extra days away to practice his hobbies and see his friends (which I always acknowledge as very important and outwardly support, regardless of my own feelings of loneliness and loss of priority in his life). We had a deep conversation about this where he acknowledged it hasn’t been fair to me and that he feared starting a 9-5 job would hurt his ability to be present in our relationship. He showed a lot of vulnerability, and really broke down crying. I provided a lot of emotional support, met his needs, and put my own needs on the back burner again. 

I don’t know how long I can put my needs on the back burner like that, while supporting his. I am starting to resent him, feeling my cup is empty and my plate is overflowing with no support. While he struggles with his one obligation (work) and uses the free time to make space for himself and his needs and hobbies, I am expected to over perform and handle my dozen obligations, have very little time for myself, and disregard my own emotional and romantic needs. This feels like it may just be the same general trap that most women fall into, of playing every role, having to have the capacity to do everything. I am terrified of committing to a partner that makes me worry I will be spreading myself thin my whole life, caring for everyone and having no one to care for me. Having grown up in an abusive home, I have never in my entire life had another person truly care for me and I worry it will kill me one day, I’m so exhausted. Yet I stay calm and level, never ask for too much, get the work done. I just want my one person, my life partner, to be the one space I feel safe and supported but I don’t know if that’s realistic. 

Reddit, I don’t know if I’m giving up a good thing out of fear, or if the valid concerns I have are enough of a red flag. Relationships are complicated, I don’t want to be alone forever, I don’t want to be exhausted forever either. How long is a reasonable amount of time to wait it out, with a relationship of only 3 months? If you’ve experienced similar, what helped? 

TLDR; Amazing relationship became not so amazing after partner [28M] started new job, taking away his time and energy. Imbalance in effort and responsibilities is causing me [28F] resentment and emotional pain. We love each other, but we question our ability to make it through this without damaging our relationship permanently. He wants things to work, I am exhausted and feel neglected. Should we step away from this relationship, or weather the storm together? What can we do to improve things for the both of us?"

*“How should I tell the priest about my sins? Is a feeling of repentance indispensable during confession? After confession, should one expect a feeling of spiritual relief, or lightness of soul? These beginners’ questions often remain troublesome even for very experienced parishioners. Many of us are too fainthearted to “waste a priest’s time” with such “simple and insignificant” questions. In order to fill in this gap about confession, such “simple and insignificant” questions were given by our NS correspondent Dmitry Rebrov to the highly-respected Protopriest Valerian Krechetov, the senior father-confessor**^(\[1\])* *in the Moscow Diocese and head priest of the Church of the Protection in the village of Akulovo, Moscow Province.*

**IS REPENTANCE AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PRIEST AS INTERMEDIARY?**

**– Father Valerian, how would you explain to a church-newcomer what confession is and why it is necessary?**

– Once a professor at a theological academy gave my father--also a priest--this question during an exam: “Tell me, young batiushka^(\[2\]), (and my father was already in his fifties; he was 49 when he entered the seminary), what does God do when he wants to bring someone to Himself? My dad answered this way and that, and the old professor agreed. Yet towards the end, to get at the heart of the matter, he asked, “And what is the most important?” He himself answered, “He sends a person spiritual heaviness and sorrow of soul, so that the person will seek God, so that he will realize that he cannot be delivered from that condition by any earthly means.” And I think this is very true! During his life, a person constantly and inescapably runs into the consequences of his sins. There is a saying, “Live in such a way during the day, so that at night your conscience won’t bite.” This is an expression of folk wisdom: it is certainly true that one’s sleep is disturbed by impressions of what one did, said, or saw during the day. It seems that everything has gone without problems, but then one begins to ponder on some incident or other, and hears a certain voice saying something to him--the voice of conscience. Sometimes a person, seeing that what he has done is irrevocable, takes a terrible step: he decides to “deliver” himself from this earthly life, or he begins to drink. And thus a person falls into a state even more ruinous than that from which he is fleeing. All of this is but anesthesia; the person can’t cure the disease, but he gets rid of the symptoms, or at least numbs himself to them. Searching for a way out of this pain of soul also brings him to see his need for repentance and forgiveness, one of the basic causes compelling a person to go to Church and confession.

**– It is often asked, “Why does a person have to go to church and confess before a priest? What’s wrong with repenting alone, by yourself, before God--at home, for example--without an intermediary?**

– If confession in a church isn’t possible for some reason, then it ***is*** possible to confess this way, without an intermediary. But can a neophyte hear when God says, “Very good, I forgive you?” Saint John of Kronstadt, when he sinned in some way, would pray until he received forgiveness and spiritual healingfrom God. But does a neophyte have such a degree of communication with God?

People have a natural need for personal contact. But both in relations with another person and in relations with God, it is very important not only to be understood, but also to have a visible sign that God or the other person understands you. The Lord established it thus, that a person receive His forgiveness through another person: a priest. *Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained* (John 20:23).

**– When a person comes to confession, sometimes the question arises: What kind of things specifically should a person confess? Our conscience doesn’t seem to bother us, doesn’t accuse us of anything; we didn’t kill anyone, didn’t rob anyone.**

– Yes, the conscience accuses a person first of the serious sins. But if the conscience doesn’t say anything, often that is because the conscience has opened its mouth before, but the person stopped it up. The holy fathers say that if a person goes from sunlight into a dark room, he begins first to see big objects, then smaller; if he lights a light, then he begins to see everything. In the same way, a person who begins to keep track of his inner life at first sees only the big sins, then the smaller. Then grace gives him light so that he can see his own sins, for this is what we ask God during Great Lent through the prayer of Saint Ephraim the Syrian.

Specifically of *what* sins one should repent is a question of time. At first a person doesn’t understand or notice very much. But during the sacrament itself … ***grace***, the spirit of God, begins to open up a person’s ability to see his sins. And the person, perhaps not even realizing specifically how he has sinned, all the same **feels** his sinfulness. Although the confession of sins includes the idea of comprehension;there is also a state of feeling when a person realizes simply that he is sinful in comparison to holiness; and this also is the action of grace. For example…

My father was born in 1900, so the post-revolutionary years came during his youth. There were all these new currents of thought, this breath of “freedom” … and so he drifted away from the Church. His mother, my grandmother, asked him during Lent if he wouldn’t go to Church and take Holy Communion. She said, “If you do, I’ll bow down at your feet.” “Oh Mama, you don’t have to do that, I’ll just go,” he answered, and went to the church on the Arbat, to Father Vladimir Vorobiev (the grandfather of Archpriest Vladimir Vorobiev, the current rector of St Tikhon’s Orthodox University). He got in line for confession and had not a single thought about repentance; he just stood there and looked at the pretty girls. When his turn came, he knelt down, and to the priest’s question, “Well, young fella, what do you want to say?” my papa answered, “I don’t have anything to say.” “And why did you come?” “My mama asked me to.” The priest was silent for a little while, and then answered, “That’s very good, that you listened to your mama.” He covered my father with his epitrachelion^(\[3\]) and began to read the prayer of forgiveness. “What happened to me next, I don’t understand to this day,” my father told me later. “I began to sob; tears came out of my eyes as if from a spigot. And when I got up and returned to my place in the church, I didn’t look at anyone, anyone at all. The world had become completely different for me.” From that time on, my father began to go to Church. Then by the Providence of God, he was sent to prison, where he was in the same prison cell with holy confessors of the faith. After prison he became a clergyman.

**THE SINS WHICH WE SEE MOST OFTEN IN OTHERS ARE ALSO IN US**

**– Are there any aids to help prepare for confession?**

– One could advise a person to read something written for this purpose; there is a good book by Father John Krestiankin, “Experience in Preparing for Confession”^(\[4\]), and some other material; but here we find a complication: there have appeared some enumerations or lists of sins in which we find a certain “relishing” or “savoring” of the sins. And one must be very careful with such lists, since they sometimes function like a kind of textbook of sin, or manual of sins; because there are listed there such sins that a person not only never did but never even thought of. One should not read a list detailing the sins of the flesh, because it soils the soul. As for the other kinds of sin, it’s better simply to pay attention to your inner state. For example, when we see a weakness in someone, the very fact that we notice that weakness means that that sin is also in us. You remember the “mote” in someone else’s eye and the “beam” in your own? What is it, this mote? A mote grows into a log, and a log is a passion. The mote is a sin; that is, a concrete manifestation of that passion. But if we do not know what kind of tree it is, or what kind of log, if we don’t even know that they are harmful, then we will never suspect what the mote is all about. As it is now expressed, “Everyone understands things according to the degree of his depravity.” And so we notice in another person specifically that sin, we *understand* specifically that passion, which is *in us ourselves*.

**– Some people are disturbed that forgiveness, it turns out, is so easy to receive. A person sins, then repents, then sins again, then repents … and over and over? Without any repentance?**

– Why do you say that? Who told you such a thing? At confession, sin is forgiven; but even so, a person still has to bear the consequences of his sin. The classic example is the repentant thief who was crucified on the cross beside Christ. He repented, and the Lord said to him, *Today you will be with Me in Paradise*. Nothing unclean can enter into Paradise, so we know that the Lord has already purified him and forgiven him his sins; nevertheless, he remained hanging on the cross! And if that weren’t enough, the Gospel tells us that the soldiers then broke his legs (cf. John 19:32). A person all the same has to bear consequences for his sins, although certainly not to the degree he deserves to suffer.

**– Many Christians, although they confess every week, nevertheless remain sinners, in no visible way differing from everyone else. Furthermore, they repent over and over again of the very same sins. It turns out, does it, that confession hasn’t helped them?**

– Nothing of the sort. He who constantly labors over himself already differs from other people. Regarding the very same sins, even the Apostle Paul was given a *thorn in the flesh*, some kind of pain, suffering, or trial, so that he would not get puffed up. As they say, “Until the last breath, even up to the gates of Paradise, the battle with sin goes on.” St Mary of Egypt repented, but for another 17 years she struggled fiercely with sin!

**– Is it necessary to have a feeling of repentance during confession? Some people simply list their sins without any visible emotion. Is this also okay?**

– The importance of the struggle with a sin is not simply that a person names it, but that the sin becomes disgusting and repulsive to him or her. When we were on Mount Athos, a priest asked one of the spiritual fathers, “Why does it happen that we repent, have Holy Communion, and then go out and commit the same sins again?” The elder answered, “It is simply because pain of heart has not yet outweighed and overpowered the sin!”

If you simply enumerate sins, with no pain of heart, that means that you don’t have an inner battle with sin. Repentance obviously includes acquiring an inner feeling of repentance. And this feeling is from God—you can’t give orders to your heart. But sometimes, simply naming your sin at confession is a labor unto blood.

Confession is only the *beginning* of repentance; repentance is the backbone of one’s whole spiritual life. Regarding the prayer which the priest reads at confession (the priest usually reads the beginning of the prayer at the start to everyone together, but the end of the prayer to each person *individually).* “I forgive and remit…” Thus begins the concluding part, and includes the words, “…give him/her (the person confessing, whose sins are being remitted by this prayer) the image of repentance.” What was before that, you ask? He or she has clearly already repented, yet we priests immediately read, “…give him/her the image of repentance!” This is in order to show clearly that immediately after our confession, a new level of repentance begins.

Do you remember how the Apostle Peter in the Gospel fell at the feet of the Saviour and said, *Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord* (Luke 5:8)? This too is a repentant state, which my father also experienced that time when he felt the grace of God!

**– When some people come to the Church, they totally change their lives after their first confession. Some, on the contrary, hardly change at all, continuing to live in their sins as before. On what does this depend?**

– It depends on one’s determination, one’s resolve. One needs to ask for God’s help, for firm resolve, and also for patience. About 40 years ago we were talking with Father John Krestiankin (he was still young then), and he asked if I had read these words of the Apostle James: *If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God* (James 1:5). He asked me, “What kind of wisdom do you think this is? The wisdom of Solomon? No, it is *patience*!” Patience is a spiritual art, a spiritual science. And ***through*** ***patience*** a person can truly be delivered from sin.

**– Sometimes after confession there comes a feeling of spiritual relief or lightness of soul, and sometimes not. What does this mean? Should one expect such a feeling after every confession?**

– If there is such a feeling, glory be to God. But one should not expect it, or wait for it. It will not necessarily appear; and if it doesn’t, that means that one should keep working, that in the battle with sin one can never relax. In general, one should not expect spiritual states, and certainly not seek them. If such states are granted—good; but one shouldn’t expect them. Actually *seeking* or pursuing such spiritual or emotional states is categorically forbidden. If you do not feel spiritual lightness or emotional relief after confession, that does *not* mean that God has not accepted your confession. One of the incidents of the holy fathers goes like this: A certain man repented all the time, genuinely, but all the same was still not delivered from a feeling of heaviness; the fathers of the monastery began to pray for him, “O Lord, he repents so sincerely; why have You not yet forgiven him?” And the answer came, “I forgave him long ago, but this suffering is necessary for his salvation.”

**– How much detail should a person go into when describing his sins at confession? Is it enough to simply list them, or is it necessary to tell the priest in detail??**

– Unfortunately, if each person described everything in detail, confession might last till evening. Sins of the flesh, in particular, should not be told in detail. Also regarding this kind of sin: when a person explains about the circumstances, in my experience, there is often an element of self-justification. Other people sometimes start to retell their whole workday; they have brought me at times entire notebooks. If you start to describe what you have done over the last week or month, then you end up with a whole novel!

The most important thing is not the details but the struggle: if one has named a sin, he should also wrestle with it. If there is not a real battle with sin, then all the details in the world won’t help.

*Protopriest Valerian Kr***e***chetov was born in 1937 into the family of the repressed**^(\[5\])* *accountant and afterwards priest Michael Krechetov. The future Father Valerian graduated from high school in 1959 and then was accepted at the Moscow Forestry-Engineering Institute. Three years after graduation, he followed the example of his father and entered Moscow Seminary. He was ordained a priest on January 12, 1969, and in 1973 graduated from Moscow Theological Academy. During his long years of service as a priest he was able to get to know many outstanding pastors, including Father Nicholas Golubtsov, Father John Krestiankin and Father Nicholas Guryanov. At present, he is the senior father-confessor of the Moscow Diocese and head priest of the Church of the Protection in the village of Akulovo, Odintsovski District.*

^(\[1\])father-confessor (*dukhovnik* in Russian): in this context, the meaning is not simply “spiritual father”, but an experienced spiritual father and priest who has been granted by his bishop the right to confess other priests in that diocese; these confessions customarily take place during a fasting period such as Lent.

^(\[2\])**Batiushka:** an endearing term for a priest or monk; and respectful, old-fashioned word for one’s father. Accented on the first syllable: “b***a***tiushka.”

^(\[3\])**Epitrachelion**: a vestment which hangs as a stole from the neck of a priest, and is placed on the penitent’s head when the prayer of absolution is said; it is the one indispensable vestment for all priestly ministrations.

^(\[4\])In Russian this book is entitled *Opyt Postroenia Ispovedi*, the printed version of a series of talks given at Pskov Caves Monastery during Great Lent to help people prepare for confession.

^(\[5\])**repressed** (in Russian *repressirovanni*): a victim of political repression; this usually includes years of suffering in a concentration camp.

Anime Original Content for Cour 4,bankaifolk,1i9vany,2025-01-25 14:48:42,8,1.0,5,https://i.redd.it/celbdsf927fe1.jpeg,Inferno221,Anime,"Well this is it. With Cour 4 being the only thing left, we're about to see the ending come into fruition. The same ending that fans have had to resort to Kubo's failing health to excuse it's anti-climactic performance. For years, a lot of people including myself gave Kubo the benefit of the doubt, thinking he wanted to do so much more with the last arc, but couldn't due to his health.

  
Well, now we shall see if Kubo really did have much planned, or if it was all a shitshow. 

  
People have used the excuse that the anime didn't fundamentally change anything from the manga, but I disagree, there are some things that have changed, namely that zero squad actually got a fight, and ishida actually felt like a traitor instead of taking a few potshots here and there at ichigo. 

But as far as major beats go, it's fair to say that we can expect ichigo to beat yhwach and save the day. No one is saying ichigo is gonna die. But I do see some naysayers saying that nothing is gonna change in the anime, in which I say to such people, you haven't been paying attention. 

Let's take a look at how many chapters are left to adapt:

* Cour 1: Adapted 57 chapters
* Cour 2: Adapted 71 chapters
* Cour 3: Adapted 52 chapters
* Cour 4: 25 chapters left

Cour 3 adapted roughly the same amount of chapters as Cour 1 did while giving us anime original content (ishida fights, ukitake, etc). 

Cour 4 has HALF the remaining chapters left as Cour 3 did. 

There are only a few fights remaining:

* Askin vs Yoruchi/Urahara. This fight is rather complete in the manga, shouldn't take more than 1.5 episodes to adapt
* Gerard vs everyone: This fight dragged on in the manga, it's likely that will get an extension, but not to the point where it's 3 episodes long. (2 episodes max)
* Ishida vs Hascwalth: This fight can use its own episode to be extended.  (1 episode)
* Ichigo vs Yhwach: This is the fight that needs the most polish. Gerard should not have a longer fight than Yhwach
   * Ichigo and Orihime Fight Yhwach 
   * Yhwach breaks his bankai, goes to fight Aizen
   * Ichigo and Renji go to him, and fight him for one chapter
   * Yhwach gets still silvered
   * The end

Yhwach's fight, as it stands, would cover a max of 2 episodes. Unless Cour 4 is 6 episodes long, the above would basically take 6.5 episodes. That would leave HALF the cour for anime original content. 

So if they're gonna extend Yhwach's fight, the only reasonable place for him to do it would be before he gets hit with the still silver arrow. 

How are you gonna reasonably extend Yhwach's fights for 6 episodes with him being at the full power of the almighty?

  
You can't. There's no reasonable way to do it. The only thing would be to somehow change it. 

  
Also as a side, this is potentially the LAST piece of Bleach media we're gonna consume in a LONG while. I don't expect a full-fledged ~~Hell arc~~ after the anime is over. No reasonable person should, because not only would it take years to finish, but I don't see how Kubo would avoid the same mistakes as the TYBW and Arrancar arc of introducing +20 villains and wasting time on each of them as fodder enemies. I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but my gut tells me he's more likely to do burn the witch 2. "

Tips for dating when you’re so sex repulsed that don’t even want to hold hands?,asexuality,1i9v941,2025-01-25 14:46:50,3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1i9v941/tips_for_dating_when_youre_so_sex_repulsed_that/,AppleGreenfeld,Need advice,"So, I’m an asexual person who thought she could compromise on sex (and sexual activities, I’m not talking about the piv necessarily) for the longest time. Like, with men I really liked or loved, or with men I saw the relationship going somewhere, I agreed to kissing, sex, or intimate play for them, because I felt that it’s their need, that it’s what I’m supposed to do. And I was left every time: ghosted, slow ghosted etc. Some the men just wanted that and left, and even though I might have enjoyed the touch, I always felt used: yes, maybe it was pleasant, if it was just a handjob or something not too invasive, and I like non-sexual touch (which it usually was for me, like, I’d give a man a handjob and he’d give me a back rub or something else I enjoy), but I wouldn’t do it if I knew that the relationship isn’t going anywhere, it’s too intimate for me to just “have fun” about. Other men saw that I wasn’t enjoying it and left because of it, which was also frustrating: like, I chose to kiss or have sex or touch you because it was important to you, and you’re leaving me because I wasn’t ecstatic? So, I sacrificed something for a man and he left because of something I can’t control (my feelings about sex and kissing). 

The last thing that hurt me the most was when I tried having sex with a fwb of four years. We did have some sexual experiences together over these years (like intimate touching, handjobs etc), but it was never piv sex. He knew everything about me and sex: that I don’t have any experience (I lost my virginity to a guy, it was basically a one night stand because I was really curious what sex is, and never had piv sex again after that), that I’m not really sexual and am not really interested in sex, that it hurts for me (I do have vaginismus), that it even feels scary for me. But I did really have feelings for him, so I agreed to it after four years. I was almost 30 and wanted to try having sex with someone who I’m actually attracted to and whom I like. He is very experienced and much (20 years) older. And it was a more meaningful experience to me, and he was fairly attentive to me, but after a couple of times I had a massive breakdown because he never did aftercare: didn’t hug after or anything. And I felt used again. And he also started to slowly ghosting me after that, even though everything was ok for four years, and our relationship wasn’t built on sex, at least for me. 

So, now I’m at a point where I hate everything connected to sex for me. I don’t care if other people are having sex, I don’t think that sex is bad. But I think it’s bad for me. I’m not curious anymore. I feel like it’s a barrier to relationships for me: like, if I enjoyed sex, I’d be in a relationship by now (I’m 30 and have never been in a relationship). And that I shouldn’t even try to have sex because everyone will just leave me after it. So, it’s like damned if I do (have sex and men will leave because I don’t enjoy it) and damned if I don’t (don’t have sex and men will leave because I’m not having sex). So, I have a very negative outlook on sex right now, and I don’t want to change it. I don’t see a point: I’m ok with not having sex, I’m content this way. Also, with age, my libido is declining, so I don’t even have the urge, even my body doesn’t need it. And all the STIs, pregnancies that can come out of it… Like, why would I even want to want that?

But it gets in the way of my dating. I do want to date. I mean, I REALLY do, so much that there’s no denying it. I really want a partner. And I’m not even opposed to cuddling, or back rubs, or handjobs. When we get to know each other better. By that, I mean like a year, when we’re engaged or maybe married, because now I really only want to touch a man who has decided that he’s committed to me. Because while I do enjoy non-sexual touch, I’d rather be touch starved than start touching and be rejected because it didn’t lead to sexual, or because he’s got everything he wanted (touch) and wasn’t as serious about me. It’s too intimate for me to share with a man who’s not mine for life. 

But, well, I can only date through dating apps due to my work schedule, health and limited transportation options. I work a regular office job full-time, I don’t have a car, so around 10 hours of my day are taken by work and traveling to work, and then I take care of my health, like exercising, eating right and having sufficient down time, and on the weekends I have to be at home because I live in a country where there’s no weekend public transport. So, all of the meetups and gatherings where I could meet someone organically are not accessible for me, my health declines even if I do it once a week, because I physically can’t get somewhere at 6-8 pm on a weeknight and then be home and go to bed at around 1 am and be ok the next day, I wake up at 6:30 am every day. So, I only date through apps because this way I can meet a guy for an hour when it’s convenient for me, then gradually increase the time and when I trust him, we can meet on the weekends and he picks me up in his car. 

I feel like on the apps there’s this expectation that things have to move quickly physically. I’m not even talking about sex. Even the guys who are ok waiting for sex, want to at least kiss you. Or hold hands. Even if they’re willing to wait, they’re willing to wait a month or two, which is crazy, they’re still a stranger to me! Also, from my experience, I know that a guy never wants to just hold hands. He wants to hold hands on this date. Then on the next date it’s holding hands and a kiss. On the next one — it’s a makeout session. And then… So, I know that it’s leading somewhere and therefore I don’t enjoy it, I don’t even want to hold hands. 

If someone is in this situation (dating like crazy and serious and intentional about finding a partner, but being sex repulsed to the point of being touch repulsed), what do you do? 

Things I CAN’T do: 

1. Go to therapy. I have a very long and traumatic history with therapy. And every time I’ve tried discussing this specific issue, no therapist understood me, they were trying to hint that I have sexual trauma. Also, K really don’t have the money, especially for a good niche sex therapist. 
2. Date asexuals. I live in a small country (Israel), and the asexual community here is small and in the area that’s pretty hard for me to get to (in the center of the country where I don’t live). So, I date through Tinder and other apps. 

The thing that doesn’t seem to work for me: 

Being honest about asexuality. I’ve been trying to do that for years, but guys seemed to be ok with it and then left because of it; seemed to understand that I need more time and were obviously waiting. One waited for a year before leaving, was clearly waiting to see if I want to have sex with him before deciding if it was worth it to get married to me. Or they try to persuade me that I just haven’t met the right one and that I’m not asexual. In all of the convos I’ve never had any positive result. By positive I mean at least “oh, thank you for the heads up, it’s not for me, wish you all the best”. So, now I just date and take it one step at a time. Like,  say nothing, but when a guy tried to kiss me, I don’t do it, and at first say that it’s too early for me (I did enjoy kissing two men in my life, so he might be the third…) and if after a few dates I still don’t want to kiss, I open up that I don’t really like kissing, and it might take a lot of time for me to want to kiss. And so on. It works better by that I don’t need to have the convo and guys just leave, but also not ideal… 

So, what do you do?

💎 3 Hidden Gems Set to Dominate 2025,AllCryptoBets,1i9v8fh,2025-01-25 14:45:55,42,0.96,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i9v8fh/3_hidden_gems_set_to_dominate_2025/,gamer_paradiser,Memecoin,"Hey everyone, Ark here!

The crypto market may be unpredictable, but that’s where some of the best opportunities lie. I’ve been tracking three standout projects - $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE. These projects are building serious momentum and offer unique value propositions for 2025. Here’s why you should keep them on your radar:

# $PLATH (SOL) – Conservation with a Twist

https://preview.redd.it/hoiv3fwrl6fe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f21ca407d2e24cb919017c7b5bb1b8a60ed2f9ab

**$PLATH** is bridging the gap between innovation and impact. Their charitable focus on adopting endangered platypuses (21 and counting) through the WWF sets them apart, while their commitment to environmental stability hints at a broader charity roadmap for 2025.

But it’s not all about giving back - $PLATH has fun, too. Their Telegram and Reddit bots (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?) and upcoming NFTs add a layer of engagement for the community. Combine that with a strong team of diamond-handed whales, constant token burns, top-holder airdrops, and this project has serious long-term potential.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.1M
* **Strengths:** Charitable initiatives, original art, strong community engagement.
* **Targets:** Potential for a 2x-3x short-term, with significant long-term promise.

**$CATBAT** is not just a token; it’s a mission-driven initiative to clean up the crypto space. From developing ScamScout, a tool to help users avoid scams, to offering a unique rugged coin redemption platform, they’re tackling real issues head-on.

Daily token burns, top-holder airdrops, and partnerships with other major projects add to its appeal. Plus, the dev has locked his token supply for a year, building trust and ensuring stability for the community.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.7M
* **Strengths:** Anti-scam tools, daily burns, strong roadmap.
* **Targets:** ATH at 4M, with fast growth as tools roll out.

**Contract Address:** mo7mapMrCsyci5w1td1wgrKPtNeCfjfkKi96DknWi5N

**$PYRATE** isn’t just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. From a rich storyline featuring characters and comics to a pfp builder web app and ocean-cleaning charity initiatives, this project is all about innovation and engagement.

With over 170K users of its Telegram bot, CEX listings on the way, and paid promotions kicking off soon, $PYRATE is positioning itself for explosive growth. Plus, their focus on community gaming (Minecraft and more) is a fun way to strengthen their loyal crew.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 790K
* **Strengths:** Expanding ecosystem, charity initiatives, engaged community.
* **Targets:** Near-term 1.5M, with potential for previous ATHs (3M) and beyond.

I feel bad for that and it feels like theyre only adjusting because they ‘have’ to and not because they ‘want’ to- and a lot of times as if theyre only doing it because i called the discomfort out. I hate this so much. I want to stop talking to people entirely. I feel like I think this way because several people have usually either:-

•shown no improvement in long run
•guilt tripped me later that theyre ‘adjusting’ for me and i should be grateful
•stopped their betterment in behaviour later on


And btw. My basic needs are simply asking my friends to reciprocate the efforts i make (such as asking about my day when i ask about theirs, reciprocate the attention i give instead of having me to do most of the things and…. Actually treat me as if theyre interested.)"

Mental health professionals have been struggling to determine my diagnosis for years.  Basically, there are two camps:

***Camp A)***  I have a personality disorder, likely BPD with components of other personality disorders. 

***Camp B)***  I have no personality disorder, but when my Schizoaffective Bipolar Disorder and ADHD aren't treated, it presents like a personality disorder.

***Evidence for Camp A:*** 

*  I'm evidently too high functioning for a psychotic or mood disorder
* There have been a lot of suggestions that I am deceptive.  I personally don't think I am - I work really hard to be super honest and up front, often to my detriment - but this has repeatedly come up when I have mentioned symptoms and they have then reported in the file that this must not *actually* be the case.  Like how I endorse a love for spending time alone, but then they say in their notes that I must not actually like being alone because I seem very extroverted in my presentation and I chose a very social job.  Or they will be like, ""Parents divorced at young age.  Patient says this was not an issue for her and hasn't caused any trauma.  May benefit from psychodynamic therapy"".
* I had one team of psychiatrists and therapists in an IOP that I participated in when I was 19 or so diagnose me with Personality Disorder NOS with traits of BPD, NPD and DPD.  
* I have had ER physicians and psychiatrists note BPD traits on my chart during two years of repeated ER visits over a span of two years in my early thirties
* When I was in my mid-thirties, I went back to the ER and a psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD based on what had been previously noted in my chart but without doing a psychiatric interview with me.  We did talk for twenty minutes or so, but not about my life in general, just about that one emergency room admission. 
* I don't have a lot of external hallucinations.  
* I have had marital problems since having a kid about 8 years ago and entering therapy a year or two after that.  
* No one was able to detect my manic episodes. Strangers noticed, but my actual family and friends didn't, indicating that they weren't actual ""mania"".  
* History of self-harm
* The medications that have worked effectively for me (Clozapine, Loxapine and Latuda) are used off-label to treat personality disorder symptoms at times
* I retain some level of insight during mental health crises (like I know that it isn't normal to feel good and suicidal at the same time, or I know that I normally wouldn't think it was a good idea to jump off a bridge to enter a portal to another dimension so even though I try to convince myself that I should do it like I know I am being called to do I will have periods of doubts).  
* I have traditionally reached out for help when feeling acutely suicidal
* I have believed I had factitious disorder before.  I didn't fake any of my symptoms or anything, but I thought I was subconsciously doing them as a need for attention or something, and that I wasn't actually sick
* Nurses in the Emergency department have endorsed BPD
* I can have periods of intense irritability around other people



***Evidence for Camp B:*** 

* I fully remitted from every single symptom when on Clozapine and Dextroamphetamine.  The first time  this occurred lasted for a two year period.  The second time was only over the course of a few months, but both times continued until I discontinued my medication.
* All of the ER encounters noted above were after I had abruptly stopped medication. 
* Any psychiatrist or psychologist who has treated me (not just seen me one time) outside of the IOP program when I was 19, has not endorsed any personality disorder.  Many have investigated the possibility, but none have ever come to the conclusion that I actually had a PD.  I have been with my current psychologist for over 5 years, and my current psychiatrist who treats me in the hospital and out of the hospital for the same amount of time.  
* I have periods unmedicated without any significant symptoms around emotional dysregulation.  Some potential ongoing psychotic symptoms have occurred, but not anything definitive - I can't confirm whether I have delusions when not experiencing a mood episode, and my hallucinations aren't clear-cut. 
* I have many close relationships with family and friends with no conflict or minimal conflict.  I have been with my spouse for nearly twenty years.  I have at least 4 very close friends who I know I could call on for absolutely anything and those friendships have ranged from 27 years to 4 years.  I have a smattering of other friends that I could call for social outings or assistance if needed.  I don't feel a real need for social relationships, but I do enjoy the ones I have as long a I get enough quality alone time.  None of my family or friends endorse any personality disorders.
* I respond to medications very well, and the problems tend to be around significant side effects rather than treatment-resistance.  The medications that work best for me are Clozapine, Loxapine and Latuda (in that order).  
* My delusions have always been bizarre rather than focused on people in my life
* I struggle more with thought issues than mood issues, but when mood issues do occur they can dangerously exacerbate the thought issues - like thinking I need to commit suicide in order to align myself with the universal power.  I don't actually believe this normally - I am a semi-active Catholic.  
* Some of my worst mental health crises have occurred when my life was at its absolute best, with minimal stress, great strategies being used, healthy environment.  They do tend to correspond with me not managing my sleep schedule well.  
* The being dramatic/attention seeking belief doesn't align with my behaviour outside of my past willingness to reach out for help, but even when reaching out for professional help I wasn't really disclosing to family and friends the extent of what was going on.  I tend to downplay a lot of the stuff, even with medical providers because I don't want to be seen as dramatic.  
* I had a separate clinical psychologist who specialized in assessing BPD do a private assessment so that I didn't have to share the info if I didn't want to, and could be fully upfront with everything that could possibly indicate a BPD diagnosis, and she did not endorse BPD.  However, she didn't assess for other possible personality disorders.
* Nurses in the psych ward do not at all endorse BPD, but they have not ever commented on the possibility of other PDs.
* I have access to Ativan, and I rarely take it.  I have been going through the worst period of my life in the last month to two months, have had a prescription of 30 Ativan to take as needed, and I have taken maybe 4?
* I rarely get angry, and when I am angry, I am very focused on resolving the conflict in a fair and diplomatic way which I guess it an atypical response for people with emotional dysregulation.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So one of the primary reasons I am not currently accepting any further treatment for my Schizoaffective/Bipolar is that I don't want to be taking medications for something I don't have if I can be working on it through therapeutic techniques.  I know I can have \*both\* a PD and a mood disorder, but I feel like there aren't definitive symptoms outside of each that only fall into one category and therefore justify both diagnoses.  I personally feel like the Schizoaffective-Bipolar type + ADHD diagnoses align with what I feel and experience, but if I don't have insight into my psychosis most of the time, could the same be said for any potential personality issues?  And it would be irrational for me to dismiss this as a possibility.  

So how do I go about choosing the right treatment plan for me?  I want to trust my treating psychiatrist, but that fact that so many other psychiatrists are ready to pop that label of a PD on me immediately makes me second guess things - and now that it is on my chart and I can't have it removed, I feel like I should at least be exploring that route for a few years.

I don’t usually take the time to talk about a project unless I really believe in it. But recently, there’s been something about $HEGE that’s been sticking with me, and I feel like it’s worth sharing. We all know how many projects out there are full of empty promises and flashy marketing. So when something stands out for the right reasons, I think it’s important to pay attention.

$HEGE isn’t just another token. It’s a project with a clear vision: to redefine how we engage with the world of decentralized finance. What really sets $HEGE apart is its focus on building a strong, genuine community that thrives on collaboration rather than competition.

What struck me the most is how $HEGE isn’t just about making money. It’s about creating a space where people can come together, share ideas, and build something lasting. I’ve seen firsthand how the team behind $HEGE values transparency and keeps the community at the heart of everything they do.

One of the things that really caught my eye is the way they’re bringing together innovative technology and a user-friendly approach to finance. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced crypto enthusiast, $HEGE is designed to be accessible and provide real value to everyone involved.

But it’s not just about the tech it’s about the people. The $HEGE community is growing rapidly, and there’s a real sense of camaraderie. Everyone is supporting each other, sharing knowledge, and pushing each other to succeed. That’s not something you see every day in this space.

So, if you’re looking for something different in the world of crypto something that values long-term growth, a strong community, and real innovation then $HEGE might just be the project you’ve been waiting for.

In my years before that I constantly skipped classes, never cared about school, barely passed by cramming the night before exams (and then forgetting what little I read afterwards...). I applied for a random Master's  just to tell myself that at least I tried the whole school thing before fucking off to a retail job or something.... And miraculously they accepted me.

Moreover, the Master's a perfect match for me. I love it. I want to keep working in that field, to excel and get a PhD. However... I'm still a fraud. This first semester has been really hard. I've managed to survive with my usual cramming tactics, some honest hard work and the use of AI here and there.

I've caught up on lots of things I didn't know/hadn't paid attention before. I've said things so horribly stupid that people thought I was joking lol. I've had to learn the very basics while pretending to be knowledgeable. But I learned!

Now this new semester is starting. Even though I'm learning steadily there's new material piling up. I have an advanced statistics class starting next week and I haven't done math since middle school, no joke. I'm feeling slightly overwhelmed and would love success stories.

Have any other ""frauds"" gone through my struggle and managed to come out to the other side? Any success stories or advice? Ty."

He's pretty silly and childish by his nature, basically like most of non human characters in the ""having a human owner"" trope :) In this scene he explains what love means to a pet that never really experienced it

Poppy: ughh I need to get home... Fast

Pet: huh? What do you mean? You have everything here! With our leader is where we belong! He loves us all, all we need to do is follow his rules! It's so good! 

Poppy: No! My everything is at my home, with Martha!! I don't belong here! 

Pet 2: Mar-tha?

Poppy: Yes! Martha! She's my human! She loves me and cares about me, even lets me live in her house and makes me great food :) 

Pet: woww?? I can't even imagine how many hours a day you need to pray for all that!

Pet 2: right! That sounds so great. 

Poppy: well, actually... I don't pray to her at all :) she loves me unconditionally!! 

Pet: HUH?? 

Poppy: Even when I mess up, like really badly... She says ""you're doing your best, and that's what matters"". She doesn't punish me, she just... Helps me do better next time. That's how love works, I think.

Pet 2: no rules?? no punishments..? 

Poppy: yeah. That's what makes her so special. I know I'm not perfect, but she doesn't expect me to be. I wish you could meet her... She would show you that love has no strings attached

Pet: no strings.. Oh, having a martha sounds nice. She must have a lot of love for you! 

Poppy: You're right! She does! You also deserve to have someone love you like this! 

Pet: well... I guess you could say I'm also loved here! Even though it does have a few strings attached... 

Poppy: Are you really? Because this guy literally kidnapped you, trapping you here with no way out. If he truly cared about you, he wouldn't force you to follow his rules just to earn a fragment of his love!! 

Pet: maybe you're right... Maybe I don't belong here after all.. But what can we do, then? 

Poppy: We'll find a way out. We have to! 

Pet 2: But how are we gonna do that... If the guards and the leader are constantly watching?? 

Poppy: hm... I think I might have a plan! See that window right there? 

Pet 2: yeah? 

Poppy: since this is a small room and there's a lot of us, everyday at a specific time, they need to let some air in! We could use that to our advantage and sneak through it! 

Pet 2: but it's pointlesss... The guard is always near it! 

Poppy: you right... But that’s exactly why we need to wait for the perfect moment! When the guard’s gone and that window’s open, that’s our chance!

Pet 2: hm... That could actually work, I suppose.. 

Pet: You're onto something, poppy! "

"I had no concept of someone being nice to me for ulterior motives, or the meaning of exploitation and manipulation, because I was so love starved. Not realizing that the whole purpose of denying someone care, withholding love.......is to weaken your resolve, make you compliant, docile, and weak.",raisedbynarcissists,1i9v0c3,2025-01-25 14:36:07,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1i9v0c3/i_had_no_concept_of_someone_being_nice_to_me_for/,Goodtogo_5656,[Trigger Warning],"Maybe not all abusers are like this, but my Mother was. She knew how to get what she wanted, studied your weaknesses, and then used them to her advantage. She was inhuman, indifferent to your suffering. As long as she could find a way to get what she wanted; compliance, blind obedience, control, ....whatever way she found that worked .... it didnt matter how unlovable you felt, or how it hurt you, or what you went without.

I feel like I was the poster child for future assault victim, because I didn't know how to tell, decipher, potential attacker, from someone I need attention from. I was just thinking about this the other day, and blown away that a full grown adult, doesnt' understand basic boundaries , never having had any healthy experiences with normal attachment, or any attachment. It was either being totally ignored, abused, conned and lied to, or totally enmeshed -in this emotionally incestuous dynamic where I had no identity, or self. Being raised by a con artist, controlling abuser, .....posing as a parent and calling herself ""Mother""..

It basically broke whatever gut instinct that tells you ""unsafe person"", because you had to override it every day. It makes me livid just thinking about the fact I was forced to trust, a psychopath. Call it whatever, Stockholm syndrome, it's not even a choice. You have one caregiver, and they're also your abuser, and the person exploiting you, and the person parentifying you and trying to extract every resource from you by using psychological warfare, starving you of love and attention until you're so desperate and weak, You'll do anything , accept any behavior, just to make the suffering stop.

Whatever form that suffering came; withholding all love and attention, the silent treatment, hostility and violence. This is your parent maneuvering your humanity and innocence, to serve them, having your mammalian drive for attachment, basically weaponized against you. It really fucks with your sense of self protection, autonomy, survival instincts, ....living with a predator. I think it's okay that I may have this overdeveloped self protective mechanism now, ..................where I don't trust anyone. No one.

Whatever attachment you have is traumatized attachment. So when one day they decide to be nice to you, you're so desperate for the attention, it doesnt matter if they're throwing peanuts at you like youre an elephant, you've been groomed to believe it's all you deserve. The whole thing is set up in a way, so that you accept as little care as possible, (making it easy on them of course) even though you need so much more. You don't even know how wrong it is, how blameless you are, what you're being denied. Good days was when I was the most invisible, the last thing I wanted was attention, until you can't take it anymore, and start to self destruct....at least then you can feel the pain of the deprivation and assault against yourself, maybe then someone will notice-not that you realize that's what you're doing.

So when someone was nice to me, I was groomed to accept it, whatever form that came in, having been love starved from the beginning. Never thinking about who they were, or if I had a right to decide if they were safe, *never* realizing I had a choice. Youre not picky; safe love, unsafe love, manipulative love, love that cons you , cheats you, you'll take it all. No concept that strangers could be in fact untrustworthy and dangerous-no understanding of the meaning of ""stranger"", because in reality I had no relationship, zero attachment other than a trauma bonded one, so Why would I understand any other person as ""outsider"" when I was essentially living with a predator who never recognized me as her offspring that she should protect and care for? Why would I even notice that a person at that point was ""unsafe"" or a ""stranger"", when I didnt have a safe loving attachment with anyone, and the person I was calling ""Mother"" was this unpredictable person , who was basically a stranger to me ......*because she was never the same person two days in a row??!!*

""My Mother"" was no more a mother to me, than any other con artist that saw me as nothing more than someone to take from, or abuse. So why would I be able to decipher stranger, from the vacant, remorseless, indifferent Monster that i was living with every day.....calling herself ""Mother"" to manipulate me? Like Pavlovs' dog, all I had to hear or believe, simply because she gave birth to me, that this was a ""Mother"" so that whatever else happened there, must have been okay, warranted, deserved. Basically being groomed to be a victim, only I didnt know that.

She wasn't a MOTHER, just because she gave birth to me, looked like a Mother, pretended to be a Mother or affectively conned the entire world into believing she gave a shit about her children and knew how take care of them. It's why I often got pulled in by laughing, cheating, charming , assholes that had ulterior motives, because it was what I knew. My position , or brain was taught to believe ""well at some point they might do something shitty, but I'll get something in the process, at least I'm not totally abandoned"". This is the only ""Love"" I knew.....and honestly....I never saw it until it was too late. OR, I chose not to see it, overrode my instincts, terrified if I didnt' accept this, I'd get nothing.

I didnt' know ""manipulation"", but I felt it on these ""happier"" days, looking at my Mother suspiciously , that fake ass charm, being too afraid to ask ""what about the other day when you went bat shit crazy on me for no reason, are we even going to talk about that?!""...No, never happened. This is ""New"" and improved Mom, I should just accept that, this stranger that she cultivated overnight, for whatever reason.

It messes with all your relationships. How do I know that this kindness, this ""good treatment"" that I'm accepting, isnt' going to bite me in the ass one day?

I""m astonished, and appalled, that I had no understanding of ""person who may later attack me"". Or As a woman, ""man who wants something other than my friendship"". No one had that conversation with me. How is that possible, that my own parents never sat me down and explained that to me? Or, Asked who my friends were, wanted to meet them, to see if they wanted to use me as a drug mule, or sell me to gypsies? The sad thing is , you'll accept whatever love you get. And the longer you have no clue what real love is, what actual care is, the longer you go without what you authentically need, the more deprived you are, ....... the less deserving you feel. Now you're just feral and awkward , and unlovable, and addicted to whatever cheap ass version you've been brainwashed and groomed to accept. Even if there was someone there willing to give you what you need, I don't necessarily know what to ask for??!! AT least that's how I felt. Like if you're too stupid not to understand abuse, exploitation, manipulation from actual love, then why should anyone extend it to you if you're too clueless to know the difference anyway? You must not be worth it if you don't have any sense of self worth, value, for who you are, or so worthless that you'd accept anything.

If you're starving , and someone offers you chocolate cake, you don't' say ""no, sugar is bad for me"", you devour the chocolate cake, and hope you don't die. It could be poisonous chocolate cake, you don't stop to check. I feel ashamed, that I settled for so little, not having any idea there was anything else, or what that looked like, felt like, I just didn't know....genuine nurturing, care , love. No idea or concept that I deserved "" more"", than the scraps I was groomed to accept. Having no clue or idea what ""more"" even meant? And too afraid to ask.

It's hard to admit that you've gone without genuine Love and care for so long, that you've adapted yourself to it, no clue what you actually missed, believing that you deserved nothing. If it somehow inadvertently shows up and gets beyond all your defense mechanisms, I have to find a way to keep myself from dissolving into a puddle of grief.....and repulsing people with my deprivation, and vulnerability. I have to pretend, act like someone who's had this love all along.

And being afraid to ask, or cultivating an understanding of what you  might need or require, fearing not getting it, or finding out you're not worth it, or it's too much to ask, and what you went without for so long is so vast.....that you've lost it forever.   "

Trying to go for a weekly chapter for this, but we'll see if this has legs.

\---

**Morning**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

Sheriff Reynard Mueller heaved a sigh, his gaze sweeping over the pearl-grain fields stretching out before him. The multitudes of stalks, heavy with ripe grain, appeared to shimmer in the sunlight as they swayed in the breeze. An idyllic pastoral scene common to Caedwyn Realm, the sort of sight that soothed Reynard's nerves in trying times, whether it was back in his days as a conscript in the Nexian legions, or dealing with the trials and tribulations of life on the frontier.

Reynard turned his gaze slightly to the right, the simple movement immediately souring his mood. Another plot of pearl-grain came into sight, but it was a far cry from the pristine view Reynard was admiring moments ago. A series of large and intricate patterns had been trampled into the field, as if it had been stamped by a giant branding iron from the heavens. The patterns were not confined to a single plot, but instead extended to several neighboring plots as well.

Worse still, the culprit behind the defaced fields had not been content to limit their mischief to the Burley farm. Similar patterns had been spotted out on the plains, grazing grounds, and even in the deep forest. As ever, the rumormongers were having a grand time speculating on the nature and intent of these mysterious markings. These myriad theories ranged from bored pranksters to foreign saboteurs. Even sinister beings from old folk tales were pointed to as the culprits. 

To add more kindling to the blaze, there had also been sightings of what folk were calling 'hexfire', strange and distant lights that danced in the sky with a speed and agility that did not match any creature or conveyance known to Caedwyn. Even worldly men like Reynard, who had served in the Nexian military in distant Realms, were at a loss to explain the bizarre occurrences. In the middle of this confusion, Reynard and the constabulary labored to carry out their duties. Looking to the mercifully clear skies, the Sheriff wondered if this was only the beginning of his troubles.

As if summoned by his dark mood, the angry thudding of hooves reached Reynard’s ears. That would be Eamon Burley, owner of this farm, no doubt ready to give him an earful about what an outrage this all was. Eamon was a gentleman who took it upon himself to voice his opinions at full volume, lest the world be deprived of his valuable insights. “Ah well, nice while it lasted,” muttered Reynard, bidding silent farewell to the lovely view, and turning to face Eamon.  
“Didn’t take half of forever to get here, did you, Mueller?” bellowed the irate farmer.  
“Good day to you too, Eamon,” greeted Reynard drily. “Steady on now, no sense in calling down the legions just yet.”  
“Hah! As if soldiers would be worth a damn for this mischief! There’s strange magic afoot!” said Eamon, gesturing to the defaced plot of pearl grain behind him.  
“Strange magic? How do you reckon that, Eamon?”  
Eamon leaned in and whispered conspiratorially to Reynard. “It’s dark business, I’m telling you. I’m no mage, but I did get a bit of the Sight from my blessed mother, and I didn’t feel one bloody bit of mana stirring during the whole commotion! How’s that possible, I ask you?”  
“That is a bit odd,” admitted Reynard. “Better off asking Dara about that sort of thing. She arrived ahead of me, didn’t she?”  
“Ah, Deputy Shelly, good egg that one, bright girl. Came up here with that wildman of yours in tow, she did.”

Reynard scowled at the epithet. While Meadowfolk and Woodfolk were branches of the same tree, they were often at odds with each other, given their differing ways of life. That estrangement had only deepened with the ongoing Nexian Reformations, which favored the Meadowfolk. The Nexians considered the Meadowfolk to be ‘more civilized’ than their ‘backward’ cousins, and some Meadowfolk had taken it to heart, branding the Woodfolk as ‘wildmen’.  
“Rabbit does honest work for the constabulary, Eamon. No need for that kind of talk.”  
“Pfah, what’s the lie in calling him a wildman, with his antlers looking like a tangle of brambles, and all that poppycock dangling from them?”  
“No lie at all, Farmer Burley,” Rabbit interjected suddenly, emerging from both men’s blind spots, as if appearing out of thin air.

To his credit, Reynard only flinched in surprise, while Eamon let out an undignified yelp. Rabbit stood before them, clad in his usual mottled leathers and woodsman’s gear. While Eamon’s description of Rabbit’s antlers was uncharitable, there was a kernel of truth to it. Woodfolk let their antlers grow free and untrimmed, favoring asymmetry, and decorated them with all manner of charms and talismans. The result was a vibrant mess that they proudly wore like crowns, a stark contrast to the well-trimmed and modestly decorated antlers of the Meadowfolk.

“Morning Sarge, Farmer,” greeted the smirking ranger. Most of the local Woodfolk had taken to calling Reynard ‘Sarge’ due to former military rank. Woodfolk were odd like that with names. By their reckoning, ‘Sarge’ was a name with real power behind it, a title earned by blood and deed. Not quite up to Nexian standards of professionalism, but things were a bit more relaxed out in the frontier realms.  
“Morning, Rabbit. Starting the day with a bit of stalking practice?” Reynard replied, pretending to not have been taken by surprise.  
""Oh, I weren't even trying. Easy work, coming up quiet on someone when their mind’s looking elsewhere,"" drawled Rabbit. ""But that’s not the story you want, so I’ll tell you the other. I was up on the roof, getting light prints of the mess in the fields. Dara’s out there having a closer look. Also spotted a bit of sheep track heading out to the grasslands.”  
“Oh! Right, I damn near forgot, I–”  
“Should come along so we can find those poor blighters and get them safely home. Fair plan, right?” Eamon could only mumble in agreement as Rabbit led him off to track down his lost sheep. Reynard tipped an imaginary cap to Rabbit in thanks.

**Survey Station Selene, Observation Deck**

Senior Technician Cristian Mendez heaved a sigh, taking in the stunning view from the observation deck. A vast starfield stretched out before him, a dazzling array of celestial jewels glittering against the cold void of space. The station was located on the dark side of Caedwyn’s moon, meaning planet-rise wasn’t visible to them, but Mendez preferred starfields anyway. “Sure is pretty out there. Damn shame it’s a damn death trap,” he thought aloud. Someone chuckled behind him. “Kinda like deep sea facilities, y’know? Surrounded by wonder and mystery that’ll kill you dead if you stepped out into it,” they commented.

Mendez turned to see Drone Operations Specialist Joseph Anders, his coworker and long-time friend. “More or less, yeah. At least we get bigger windows,” he replied, waving to Anders.  
“Flying drones are cooler than submersibles too, if you ask me,” said Anders, handing Mendez a cup of coffee.  
“Speaking of, wanna head to the Ops Center? Next flight is in 30, with a new rotation. Might be better to get there early to make sure the prep’s done right,” suggested Mendez, tilting his head in the direction of the Remote Drone Operations Center.  
“Damn, that’s right, double rotations after the brass went on the warpath. Let’s hop to it, then.” 

The pair set off to their workplace, sipping their drinks while continuing their conversation. “How’d that debrief go, by the way?” asked Anders. Earlier in the day, Mendez had gone through a marathon of a debriefing with the higher-ups, covering the system-wide glitch that caused all the commotion planetside. It was a dubious reward for not only being the ‘first responder’ to the whole mess, but also managing the ensuing damage control and cleanup operations.  
“You know how it goes, good work gets rewarded with more work,” answered Mendez, which got a nod of understanding from Anders. He continued, “On the plus side, they were all ears when I outlined the cleanup and retrieval plans, and they seem to be on board with playing things safer now.”  
“I’ll say they’re on board,” agreed Anders, grinning. “Word is that the computer janitors who screwed up are getting extra special attention from an oversight committee. Plus, total rollback of automated systems, manual operation with max supervision for all missions going forward.”  
Mendez nodded, his expression hardening. “About damn time. We’ve been over-reliant on the locals’ ignorance of Earth tech to stay invisible. These folks aren’t stupid. Give ‘em enough clues, and they’re gonna figure out what to look for, and where. Throw all that magic bullshit into the mix and we’re a coin flip away from our work becoming damn near impossible. High time we got back to playing it safe and using our damn heads.”  
“Look at you, all responsible and shit. Relax, all the code monkeys and their shiny toys got sent packing. We’re calling the shots until the dust settles,” reasoned Anders, which got a shrug from Mendez.  
“Yeah, I suppose that’s something. After we put out these fires, we can start pushing for some sane best practices. Speaking of cleanup though, I’ve got some plans that I need to go over with you.”  
Anders raised an eyebrow. “That sounds like more work, Cris. I already got an entire wing of drone jocks to babysit.”  
“Yeah, but this is about scooping up all the physical evidence and covering our tracks, including the stuff the locals might have in lockup. Just a big ol’ heist movie, figured you might be interested, buddy.”  
“Well shit, you know just how to bait that hook, dontcha? All right boss, lemme hear this cleanup plan of yours…”

With Rabbit keeping Eamon occupied, Reynard was free to seek out his deputy, Dara Shelly. If anyone would be able to make head or tail of this bedlam, it would be her. Dara’s meticulous nature and arcane expertise made her well suited for the task. Her mana aptitude pushed the boundaries of the gifted commoners, but sadly fell short of the admissions requirements of the regional Academy of Magical Arts. It was the Academy's loss, by Reynard's reckoning. Dara had a keen mind in addition to her arcane talents, and had proven time and again to be a valuable member of the constabulary. If those gilded robes at the Academy failed to see her worth, they could go boil their heads for all he cared.

Looking around, Reynard spotted a woman with short-cropped red hair and severely trimmed antlers walking about the fields, taking notes and collecting samples. ""Hoi, Dara! Find anything?"" he called out as he approached her.  
""Nothing of note. Well, compared to all of this,"" She was standing in a perfect circle of trampled stalks, one of many that scarred Burley's fields. Beyond the circles were also concentric  rings, equally precise, as well as myriad geometric shapes, all connected by lines of varying width. Dara made a sweeping gesture, explaining, ""Same as all the other reports, a series of intricate patterns, joined by these straight lines in an irregular loop.""  
""Hm, looks like they were going in circles when they trampled the grain,” said Reynard, looking at the way the flattened pearl-grain lay on the ground. “Some kind of ritual, then?"" he asked.  
Dara shook her head in response. ""No, ritual magic requires consistent invocation patterns, but these are too haphazard. It’s all a jumble of circles, rings, and lines. If it’s following a pattern, it’s not an arcane one.""  
""Well, Nexian magic needs regular patterns anyway,"" Reynard mused. ""But it doesn't look like Druidic magic either. Druid runework is all... wibbly-wobbly, right?"" Reynard wiggled his fingers for emphasis, earning a scowl from Dara.  
""All wibbly-wobbly? Honestly Sheriff, would it kill you to use proper terminology?"" she grumbled. ""Technically you're right, though. This isn't anything like the vine and bough patterns of Woodfolk ritual magic,"" she continued. ""It's exceedingly strange. All of the individual parts of the pattern are remarkably precise. But when taken as a whole, they're complete nonsense,"" muttered Dara to herself.  
""Well there you go, we'll put a warrant out for an insane geometer with improbably large tools,"" joked Reynard.  
“Academicians run amok, may His Eternal Majesty deliver us,” deadpanned Dara in response. They shared a chuckle as Dara continued taking measurements and samples.

Reynard took a closer look at the trampled stalks while speaking to Dara. On its own, it was simple enough to figure out. Something heavy had come along and crushed the stalks flat. A group of strong youths with a wooden beam and a length of rope could have done the job, probably. No, what made this such a mystery was how swiftly the culprits had managed to do their work so swiftly in so many places, seemingly all at the same time. There was also the matter of the witnesses swearing up and down that they neither saw nor felt any spellwork being woven during the incidents. “It is a bit odd though, that nobody with the Sight felt any magic during all this commotion,” mused Reynard.   
Dara huffed. “Don’t get me started on the nonsense that’s been going around,” she growled. “Can you imagine? Something of the size they described going airborne without the aid of magic?” Dara shot to her feet and jabbed a finger skyward. “Not just airborne, mind you, but so high up the ‘hexfire’ blinked out, like it shot past the bloody Tapestry!”  
Reynard stifled a laugh, and ventured, “So you’re saying it’s not too likely this was something mundane?”

He swore she’d start shooting plumes of fire from her eyes, from the look she was giving him. As the constabulary’s most mana-gifted member, Dara did tend to get into a lather about the particulars of the magical arts. This hexfire business in particular was doing her head in, what with damn near everything about the incidents defying common sense. Dara took a deep breath, looking like she was about to let loose with a rant, but then thought better of it and slowly exhaled instead.   
“Right then, I’m not saying the witnesses are lying, or that they’re necessarily wrong,” she began, reining in her frustration. “The issue is that it’s irresponsible to fall back on fantastical notions like manaless artifices, as if mundane forces could somehow rival the power of mana. Just because you don’t see the mana fields moving, doesn’t mean you can just throw out the fundamental order of the world,” she explained.  
Reynard nodded. “It’s as you often say, nothing happens in contradiction to the natural order,” he began.  
“They are merely in contradiction to what we currently know of the natural order, exactly,” she finished, smiling. “Sounds like you’ve been paying attention to my ‘unofficial lectures’ at least,” she added with a laugh.  
“Contrary to popular belief, I can be taught,” quipped Reynard with a wry grin. “But getting back to the issue. If there is magic at play, but nobody sensed it, what’s the more reasonable explanation? Some kind of concealment?”  
“Concealment is one option we can look into. You see, according to current literature…”

""Hey Mendez, check it out, it's Sheriff Rey-Rey and my homegirl Dara!"" said Anders excitedly, pointing to an infil-drone video feed of the Sheriff and his deputy. As persons of interest in the ongoing cleanup operations, the constabulary were under regular surveillance most of the time, and as such enjoyed minor celebrity status among the drone operators.  
""Christ, Anders. They're not a bunch of hypernet streamers, can the parasocial crap,"" replied Mendez.  
""Look, I'm a simple man. I see a redhead, I subscribe.""  
""Like you’ve got a shot, fanboy. Anything new with the law?""  
""Still the usual bagging and tagging of evidence, and interviewing witnesses. Basic police work, by the book stuff. Sheriff Rey, Dara, and Rabbit are scoping out the Burley farm, and we’ve got Baldie and Socks checking out a livestock mutilation out on the plains.”  
“Hm. And the Sheriff already swung by Splitskull?”  
“Yep, though he only dealt with Gladys’ goons, not the Hag herself. Her Ladyship was busy with other matters, apparently, and there was no sign of her outside,” explained Anders.  
“Shit, that can’t be good. The geological survey drone came back with a couple worms missing, didn’t it?” asked Mendez, referring to the burrowing sample collector robots that the survey drones deployed to take core samples over a given area.  
“Unfortunately, yeah. How much you wanna bet ol’ Gladys got her claws on one of ‘em?”  
“One of ‘em? That old bitch has got her half of the mountain sewn up tighter than a Vac-U-Seal bag. She’s gotta have snagged both, no question.”  
“All right, what kind of money you got on the failsafes actually working?”  
“So what if they did? The electronics and servos would be slagged, but that still leaves them with a bunch of goodies to play with. Space-age alloys, precision machined parts, hell, the cutting heads on those things alone would probably make ‘em shit a brick.”  
“Welp, better start brainstorming on what we’re gonna do for Operation Claim Jumper…”

**Western Agricultural Annexia**

A few minutes' ride from the Burley farm, Constables Daruth Val’Ged and Elwin Redfoot, better known as Baldie and Socks, were performing their duties in the wake of the hexfire’s rampage. They were currently investigating another incident site, similar to the others but with an alarmingly grisly difference: an eviscerated sheep lay splayed out in the middle of the strange pattern pressed into the plains grass. Socks was currently investigating the carcass. He was no stranger to gore, being a huntsman, but the display still managed to unnerve him with how bizarre it was. 

While he wasn’t the best student of magic, nothing he saw here resembled any of the rituals from the elders’ teachings. It didn’t even look like outlander magic, like what the Nexians used. The body itself harbored more mysteries. Scavengers had gnawed and mangled it some, shifting some parts from where they once sat, but a proper look revealed more. Scorch and puncture marks no wider than a knitting needle dotted the body, whether by chance or intent, he couldn’t say. The body had been cut open long before the vermin had gotten to it, surely with a magical blade. That was the only tool that could have left such clean and neat edges on flesh and bone alike. 

As for the innards, it looked like the culprit took their pick of the organs, snatching up the heart, liver, left kidney, and a good arm’s length of guts. The stomachs were cast to the side, each one punctured and emptied for gods only knew what reason. Socks couldn’t tell if this phantom butcher was a master or a madman. Whatever the culprit’s nature, Dara would definitely want to take a closer look at this. Weighing his options, he elected to bag up the carcass as evidence, seeing as carrion eaters had already run roughshod all over the scene. He silently cursed himself for not asking for the wagon.

Behind him, Baldie was interviewing Old Hob, the shepherd who had apparently witnessed the incident, but Baldie had serious doubts about that. He was trying his best to not let the cranky old cuss embarrass himself, but he was having quite the time of it. “All right Hob, let’s see if I’ve got this right,” began Baldie, his brow furrowed in consternation. Hob glared back at him. “You were out late at night, rounding up some strays that got loose, when suddenly some… thing–”  
""It were them witch-lights, a whole swarm of ‘em! I told you thrice already!”  
“Right, so down they come, shining light in your eyes. After blinding you, they snatch up the strays and leave you out on the plains.”  
“Aye, I sent up a signal too, but you lawmen showed up all slow like!”  
“We were busy, Hob. You weren’t the only one with… troubles last night,” countered Baldie. “In any case, by the time the night watch arrived, the strays had come back to you. So what’s all the fuss about, then?”  
“They’re marked by the hexfire, they are! A dark pall hangs o’er them!”  
“And that’s why you decided to shear them down to the bare hide?”  
“Well, how else was I s’posed to reveal the dark marks?”

Baldie glanced over at the shorn sheep. If they were in the thrall of some otherworldly force, they weren’t showing it. They were currently grazing on a patch of clover, blissfully unaware of the drama unfolding around them, making Baldie feel a pang of envy. Socks approached to join them, having completed the bloody business of packing up the evidence. He spoke to Hob while wiping his hands off on a rag.   
“Keep your velvet on, Hob. How about this, we’ll bring ‘em to the chattel physick to take a look-see. If he gives the all clear, you have to take ‘em back, and if something’s amiss, we’ll square away the price with you. All right?”  
“Whatever suits you, just get ‘em away from me. I don’t feel safe, knowing they’re watching me for their dark master. Who knows what they’re plotting?” hissed the old man, shaking his fist at the sheep. Baldie and Socks looked at the still oblivious animals, grazing away without a care in the world, then back to Hob. They were clearly unimpressed.

“They’re unclean, I tell you! Unclean!” insisted Hob, jabbing his finger at one of the supposed agents of the dark powers.

As if on cue, the sheep farted. Baldie and Socks remained unimpressed.

“Goddammit,” said Mendez with a tired sigh, watching Baldie and Socks on the screen as they led away their newly acquired sheep. “So we got three tracker-tagged sheep literally getting booked by the cops. What the hell is a ‘chattel physick’? Some kind of country vet or something?”  
“Yeah, a vet for farm animals, if I remember right. We’ve probably got a file on the guy and where his place is at. I’ll include it in the mission prep materials. Are we running a mission to get ‘em back?”  
“Depends. What did the drone stick ‘em with? Standard tracker, or a full on sensor package?”  
Tapping on his keyboard, Anders scanned his screen for the information. “Looks like they got the fauna biometrics tracking suite,” he said, wincing. He rattled off the specs, “Six low profile capsules, four subdermal, two intramuscular.”  
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” lamented Mendez, cradling his head in his hands. “The hell kind of retrieval mission do we fly for something like this?”  
“Aren’t you the one who said it’d be like a big ol’ heist movie? Think of it as a challenge! I can see it now, The Great Mutton Caper!”  
“*No manches* Mutton Caper! I oughta make mutton outta you, *cabron*,” grumbled Mendez.  
“Aw c’mon, look on the bright side, we’ll know exactly where they are at any given time, thanks to the trackers. That’s more than we can say for those missing driller bots,” replied Anders with a grin. 

Mendez remained unamused.

**Late Evening**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Miller’s Hollow, Municipal Guardhouse**

Reynard looked up from his ledger, glancing around the guardhouse offices. Flanking him were Baldie and Sam, busy with a stack of reports each. The three of them were handling paperwork, compiling witness testimonies for filing later. Dara and Socks were examining the animal remains and other perishable items. Rabbit and Belkund were in the evidence locker, tagging and sorting the rest of the items. They had burned every minute of daylight gathering everything they could in the wake of the hexfire sightings, and that was only half the job done. Now they had to attend to teasing apart the tangled account of events, and knit it back into a coherent and orderly telling. That’s what the Administratum would demand, and Reynard fully understood the risks of defying this expectation. 

The Nexian officials staffing the Administratum would be especially displeased with how the strange events seemed to be reviving old superstitions. Phrases like 'hexfire' were remnants of the past, rooted in the old magics of the realm, before the Nexians papered over the 'backward superstitions of ignorant rustics' with more civilized magical arts. The Nexians were accustomed to a newrealm’s old ways retreating to the margins of history, while the Nexus busily penned new chapters with grand, sweeping strokes.

Such gusto often placed a great deal of pressure on the local populace and their leaders. So far, the Nexians were content to push their Reformations at a gradual but steady pace. But Reynard knew their patience would not last forever. Soon enough, they would become much more insistent and far less polite. His time in the military taught him just how insistent and impolite the Empire could be. Not wanting to dwell further on such thoughts, Reynard busied himself with his paperwork once more.

He had a long shift ahead of him."
Feeling Defeated.,nursing,1i9uwc9,2025-01-25 14:31:16,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1i9uwc9/feeling_defeated/,No_Category_8762,Seeking Advice,"Hey all. I just recently got a job in an outpatient clinic for oncology. I work in the radiation department where I basically meet with patients during their radiation treatments and assess them and their needs. I originally came from inpatient med/surg for 5 years so oncology was sort of new to me. 

I just recently got off orientation early because everyone says how great I'm doing. Except this one doctor. All nurses have to do is assess patients, try to mitigate some problems, educate, and give report to the doctor. Every time I give report, this doctor nitpicks a lot of what I say. While I was in orientation, I paid close attention to what other nurses were saying to him in report so I can structure my report the same. However, now it seems everything I say is not pertinent information and he made me feel insecure. Mind you I'm already insecure because this is a new specialty for me. 

Anyway, I blew it off the first few times. Then it kept happening. I went as far as to give a mock report to my nurse coworkers and they said they would tell him everything I said. However, when I give the report I'm talked to sternly and rushed through my report like what I'm saying isn't important. He does NOT do this to the other nurses. 

At this point I'm wondering if I should confront him and try to find where the disconnect is? I'd like to keep everything as civil as possible but I'm unsure what to say. Anyone have any ideas or had anything similar happen to them? "
Ideas I follow.  Inspired by Stoicism.,Stoicism,1i9usqx,2025-01-25 14:26:59,0,0.17,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1i9usqx/ideas_i_follow_inspired_by_stoicism/,stoicism-philosophy,Stoicism in Practice,"I'm occasionally asked by friends and colleges what makes me tick.  I tell them about stoicism and some basic ideas I use, but it's hard to give detailed answers during brief interactions.  I decided to write this for future reference and refinement.  I welcome constructive criticism.

1- Train instincts. Psychologists separate consciousness into two parts. The fast mind and the slow mind. The slow mind is the part we think and talk with. The fast mind is what we might call our instincts. Much of psychology involves understanding the fast mind. How it functions and how to use it or treat it appropriately. When discussing the fast mind, keep two important things in mind. First is the fast mind does not think, but instead reacts to stimulus. Second is that our emotions come from the fast mind.

The fast mind cannot be directly influenced by the slow mind. We cannot simply think “I am happy” to make ourselves happy. Nor can we state “I will have perfect reflexes” to dodge attacks. Instead, the fast mind responds to training. Much like our immune system, it's meant to keep us alive. It learns that if X occurs then Y is the response, and the fast mind takes around a fourth of a second to act. Because it reacts so fast, it works using incomplete information. As a result, the fast mind often takes the wrong action. One cannot unlearn reactions, but instead must learn new reactions to override old ones.

The fast mind is often trained incorrectly. Because the fast mind's purpose is to keep us safe, it responds one hundred times stronger to negative reinforcement than to positive reinforcement, so overriding some behaviors requires considerable effort. This is where phobias come from. Weather it's arachnophobia, claustrophobia, or even homophobia and xenophobia. These are irrational fears brought on by an individual's fast mind receiving significant negative reinforcement. Phobia behaviors can be overriden as long as the individual recognizes them as irrational and actively seeks to do so. Nearly always requiring professional assistance using a technique called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, phobias become dangerous when an individual instead tries to rationalize their irrational fears. Often leading to extreme and dangerous beliefs or behaviors.

Once we understand the fast mind responds to training, it becomes possible to train it to great benefit. My favorite example is meditation. Brain scans of master meditators indicate their happiness is unmatched, but learning to quiet one's mind doesn't immediately result in happiness. Instead, it's more accurate to think of meditation as learning to think in emotion. Emotion is part of the fast mind, so one must learn to control it indirectly. Emotions are so fragile, even simple thoughts can break them. Hense the first step being learning to quiet one's mind. The remaining steps cannot be taught. One must literally feel their way through.

A second example of fast mind training are the exercises and sparring matches for martial artists. By drilling the same activities, they train their fast mind to dodge attacks and take advantage of opennings. But because it's a type of positive reinforcement, the training isn't very effective if only done in small amounts. Mastery takes years of hard work. This is true of most fast mind training. It's possible to train faster using negative reinforcement, but the risk of incorrect training greatly increases, so be cautious. Military basic training uses negative reinforcement to great effect. Survival and success in a warzone requires the proper skill set. Outside a warzone, the same skills may be useless or even detrimental and because said behaviors were learned through negative reinforcement, overriding them with positive reinforcement takes one hundred times the effort.

The fast mind is a wonderful tool when applied correctly, but a cruel master when left to it's own devices or treated with abandon.



2- Learn to gift validation to yourself. As children, we instinctively seek out validation from others. The young do not have the life experience required to determine if an action is correct, so they need others to inform them. Praising a child and thanking them for their actions teaches them what actions and behaviors they should pursue.

Seeking out validation continues into adulthood because it is useful when first learning new skills, but it can also lead to one's detriment if mishandled. A constant need for validation implies a lack of confidence or a fear of responsibility. Individuals lacking confidence are rarely trusted to carry out important matters, since they'll often make terrible decisions due to doubt in their own observations. Individuals afraid of responsibility too are not trusted with important matters because they'll allow errors to accumulate and often fixate on specific actions they must follow even if those actions do very little or actively harm the group.

Adults are always on a time limit no matter their objectives and seeking validation takes time away from actually performing. It's amazing just how much a single person can do when they stop working to be noticed and instead work because tasks need doing or for their own satisfaction. The practice will naturally improve one's confidence over time.

There is a downside however. Reward requires recognition. Weather it's one's boss, spouse, or children, the beneficiaries of our actions often fail to recognize anything not done in their own presence. Recognizing the accomplishments of others unprompted, is the companion skill to gifting validation to oneself. Among adults, that skill makes the difference between good and bad leaders. Bad leaders favor their most visible team members even if those people do the least, ostracizing their more productive members. Other team members witness this behavior and correctly put in little effort since their actions are undervalued reguardless. Good leaders go out of their way to see whom is doing what especially when it's not visible, allowing proper appreciation and value placed upon team members. When efforts are properly valued, team members are incentivized to be highly productive. Spouses especially need to recognize one another's actions and accomplishments unprompted or risk a build up of resentment. Those whom fail to recognize anything not done in their own presence are not worthy of loyalty, but if you get stuck with such a person then be sure to remind them of what you do for them and that it's not free, or risk being treated as a slave.

Seek recognition for reward, but gift validation to yourself for your own sake or be at the mercy of the whims of others.



3- Most apologies are not apologies. Apologies for accidents are benign. Two people accidently walking into one another while both are distracted is an honest mistake. However, apologies for deliberate actions have specific intent, but do not always convey genuine regret. Many are instead an attempt to avoid punishment.

As children, most develop a powerful fear of punishment. Without the life experience required to understand the consequences of their actions, children must learn as they go. This is a creature that must be taught to tie it's shoe laces and wipe it's own butt, so don't feel surprised when basic concepts like “actions have consequences” take time to learn. Ideally, parents teach their children how consequences work so the child learns to consider them better. In reality, punishment is an often used out of proportion as a short cut to curb bad behavior since few parents have the time and energy available to act as perfect teachers, but this teaches the child to avoid punishment rather than understand the reasoning for punishment.

Fear of punishment often continues into adulthood, but it's the life experience of adulthood that allows us each to remodel our own behavior and instead come to terms with punishment. Truly accepting our actions have consequences, enables us to more freely take action and live our best life. The 2 best tools I've found to facilitate behavior change are to only apologize when genuinely regretting one's actions, and to accept punishment weather regret is present or not.

Denying ourselves the use of apologies as a means of avoiding punishment forces us to be more honest, more deliberate, and more confident in our actions. This also forces us to see apologies made without regret for what they really are. A lie. Insincere at best and an insult at the worst. Holding others accountable too becomes significantly easier when we don't have to compromise ourselves in the process.

Accepting punishment as a given consequence for egregious actions forces us to carefully consider our options and accept the response should we make perilous, yet vital choices. This makes fighting injustice much easier. Think of protesters using non-violent means like sit-ins to force punishment of their actions to highlight the immoral nature of the laws requiring said punishment. For these, punishment is a badge of honor and not a sign of disgrace.

Through understanding and accepting the consequences of actions, one learns the difference between fear and respect. Fear is a one-sided power dynamic and a fleeting one at that. Fear is only effective as long as it's present and the fearful avoid what they fear. Respect is mutual and doesn't disappear the moment people lose sight of one another, so avoidance is a non-issue.

Through rejecting the fear of punishment, we are freed to pursue respect without hesitation. Both from ourselves and from others. Many won't understand this, but it is they whom must free themselves. Leading me to:



4- Bullies never fight fair, so don't fight them fairly. Weather it's verbal, physical, social, or cyber; bullying must be punished without mercy. While many bullies simply need better guidance, they must learn that actions have consequences or change cannot happen.

In youth, many learn to use disrespect toward authority and outsiders as a means to gain acceptance and social status. Children have constant authority figures in the form of adults, but don't have the experience to truly understand authority itself. To them, authority is simply a thing to be feared. Therefore they learn, being feared and having status are the same thing. This belief invites unnecessary confrontation and violence. It is a rare child that understands respect better than fear. Children bullied by adults integrate the belief that fear and violence are normal even more so, especially if the bullies are their own parents.

Continuing into adulthood, many treat disrespect as a means of attaining respect. Ironic, is it not? In their mind, respect is a finite resource and can only be stolen. In reality, respect is created by offering it and those whom understand respect is meant to be mutual, will give it back freely. Even knowing this, many won't offer respect for fear of being treated with disrespect in turn. However, this is a useful tool for discerning the character of others. Offer respect. If it is returned in kind, then you have a trustworthy partner. If it is treated with disrespect, then you know to revoke all trust and prepare for conflict.

Others might bully out of thoughtlessness, feelings of jealousy, or even outright sadism. Regardless of their reasons, they must learn actions must have consequences or their behavior intensifies.

So how do we defend ourselves? Bullies attack of their victims while unguarded. They don't want a challenge. They want a victim. Fighting one under their conditions is ill-advised unless you've had considerable training to fight back. For the rest, it's better to fight another day. Let them have a win to boost their confidence, then either use that overconfidence against them or attack when their guard is down. Either way, set a trap.

A common trap requires the aid of an authority figure. Tell the authority figure you need their help. Pick a location where the authority figure can be out of sight, then make yourself appear vulnerable to the bully. Once they take the bait, let the authority figure do their thing, but don't be idle. When confronted by authority, bullies usually learn they need to be more stealthy or lie more convincingly. Don't give them the chance. Draw attention. Ask specific bystanders to weigh in on what's happening. Describe in detail the bully's egregious actions publicly. Do not allow punishment to only happen behind closed doors even if the authority figure tries to keep it that way. Ruin the bully's reputation. It's the only thing they value. Once they are subdued, confront them with their actions. Show no mercy. They must be made to understand this is their own fault or they'll blame their victim instead and seek revenge. Don't accept a verbal apology. Tell them if they're truly sorry, they'll need to prove it with their actions. What those actions are, you and the bully must determine together. If no deal can be reached, get them permanently removed by whatever means necessary.

You'll find many businesses have policies against using humiliation as punishment. This makes sense because it can be easily abused, but that doesn't change the fact it's the most effective form of non-violent punishment. Especially if the bully in question is an authority figure. Don't be afraid to call people out publicly. In fact, bring as much attention as you can. In my youth for example, I had a terrible boss that I'll refer to as the gossip queen. She talked about everyone behind their back, including the group of 3 friends she hired to work with her. Keeping others from trusting one another was how she hid her lack of skill and lazy work ethic. On one particular occasion, I happen to walk past her bad mouthing another manager to a new manager and I brought up some good qualities of the absent manager. The gossip queen later tried to talk to me alone and asked me not to interupt manager meetings. I laughed in her face as loud as a could, so other staff could hear. “Manager meeting? Ahahahaha. Is that what you call your gossip sessions? Do you think I actually care what you say about everyone behind their backs? You even do it to the ones that think you're their friend. I'm going back to work now. Hahahaha.” Her 3 friends were gone the next day. She quit soon after when no one would work with her.

Sadism is a different beast all together. Fear of authority does not work on the sadist. They see authority as a tool to be manipulated through well crafted lies. They must either be caught and punished to the degree you never need worry about them again or they must learn to fear you as an individual to the degree they avoid you completely. They want victims, not opponents. If you are not capable of behaving cruelly to this person then you can only be the victim of them. Learn to be cruel when required. Be a monster and keep it reigned in until necessary. I will not mince my words. The world is a better place when sadists are locked up or buried.

Accept actions have consequences and conquer the fear of punishment. Understand the reasons and meanings for punishment, to appropriately deal it. Punishment rarely needs to be excessive, but there are times when mercy is a luxury.



5- The forty percent rule. Credit to David Goggins, a retired Navy SEAL, for sharing the idea. When the mind tells us we're exhausted and can't go on, we're actually only about 40% done. We can do so much more, but we have to push past the point of discomfort. As we strive to push ourselves further, our mind adapts and we can push to 45%, then 50%. The reverse is also true. Those whom never push themselves reduce to 35%, then 30%. Perseverance pays off.

The forty percent rule isn't meant to be used constantly however. That point of exhaustion exists to protect our bodies from injury. Be cautious.

Whenever I find myself at that point of discomfort, but know I need to keep going, I say to myself “Fuck it, keep going.”"

**Amy Schumer:**

While giving a speech at the Women’s Gloria Awards Amy talked about a sexual encounter she had in college. [She talks about how she went to hook up with a guy only to find him in his room wasted. But despite the fact that the guy was barely able to see straight due to being drunk she decided to have sex with him anyway. Amy went on to claim that he was so drunk that he couldn’t even get an erection. He was also falling asleep and she had to keep waking him up. Amy described the situation as her trying to find her self worth. After her speech many pointed out how the man wasn’t able to give consent due to being so intoxicated that he was loosing consciousness](https://archive.ph/6LyBp). 

“Finally, the door opens. It’s Matt, but not really. He’s there, but not really. His face is kind of distorted, and his eyes seem like he can’t focus on me. He’s actually trying to see me from the side, like a shark. “Hey!” he yells, too loud, and gives me a hug, too hard. He’s fucking wasted.

His fingers poked inside me like they had lost their keys in there. And then came the sex, and I use that word very loosely. His penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand?”

Amy’s speech was less about her raping a man and more about how she felt so little about herself she was willing to have sex with a man who couldn’t even stay awake long enough to consent.

💎 3 Hidden Gems Set to Dominate 2025,memecoins,1i9up9c,2025-01-25 14:22:50,38,0.94,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i9up9c/3_hidden_gems_set_to_dominate_2025/,gamer_paradiser,,"Hey everyone, Ark here!

The crypto market may be unpredictable, but that’s where some of the best opportunities lie. I’ve been tracking three standout projects - $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE. These projects are building serious momentum and offer unique value propositions for 2025. Here’s why you should keep them on your radar:

# $PLATH (SOL) – Conservation with a Twist

https://preview.redd.it/hoiv3fwrl6fe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f21ca407d2e24cb919017c7b5bb1b8a60ed2f9ab

**$PLATH** is bridging the gap between innovation and impact. Their charitable focus on adopting endangered platypuses (21 and counting) through the WWF sets them apart, while their commitment to environmental stability hints at a broader charity roadmap for 2025.

But it’s not all about giving back - $PLATH has fun, too. Their Telegram and Reddit bots (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?) and upcoming NFTs add a layer of engagement for the community. Combine that with a strong team of diamond-handed whales, constant token burns, top-holder airdrops, and this project has serious long-term potential.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.1M
* **Strengths:** Charitable initiatives, original art, strong community engagement.
* **Targets:** Potential for a 2x-3x short-term, with significant long-term promise.

**Contract Address:** 7wMutxpCdP3GbKaoMWoPVf2sFLCeV7a9ox25v1h2QsTp  
**Telegram:** @ PlathPortal  
**Reddit:** r/ plath\_sol

# $CATBAT (SOL) – The Crypto Space Protector

https://preview.redd.it/lg034ns4m6fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d121c7353831f6c5ad5e7eda7ca63ae1cf7ed003

**$CATBAT** is not just a token; it’s a mission-driven initiative to clean up the crypto space. From developing ScamScout, a tool to help users avoid scams, to offering a unique rugged coin redemption platform, they’re tackling real issues head-on.

Daily token burns, top-holder airdrops, and partnerships with other major projects add to its appeal. Plus, the dev has locked his token supply for a year, building trust and ensuring stability for the community.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.7M

The night is cold,nosleep,1i9um21,2025-01-25 14:19:01,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9um21/the_night_is_cold/,IntelligentTumor,,"I am writing this shacking so please forgive me for any grammatical errors. I don’t think I have ever felt fear this intense for a long long time. 

I am currently in a small farm house in styria Austria. I doubt many of you have been here given the stories I usually read but maybe some of you have. It’s a beautiful place really. Mainly green hills plastered with farms. The people are nice and there’s nothing around except for animals and cats. I loved this place because I have visited it ever since I had been a kid. My grandparents own this farm house that is basically just a cottage. It sits right next to a real farm that houses mainly cows. We are friends with the farmers there and we routinely invite them over and when me and my brother were kids we used to play with their kids or with the animals. 

Now what you have to understand is that this house is old. Old enough to make eerie creaking noises every now and then. This never really freaked me out but it would get louder every now and then. A week ago me and my mother came up here to spend a while in nature and recharge ourselves. She got the room upstairs and I chose the room downstairs. I could’ve stayed up there but I liked the children’s room. It was big and dark but it reminded me of the fun times me and my brother used to have when we were kids. 

Anyway me and my mother were playing cards but I got tired and decided to go to bed. I laid down in those old rickety beds and closed my eyes. I couldn’t sleep however. How much I tossed and turned I couldn’t fall asleep. I felt watched. Then I heard it. A whisper. 

“Hey.”

You have to imagine that it sounded like a child that was trying to get my attention without alerting anyone else. My eyes flicked open immediately and I scanned the room. 

“Over here.” 

Again eerily quiet but eerily close at the same time. It was sort of muffled so it must’ve come from outside. I looked over to the window and still saw nothing. I grabbed a flashlight and peered through the window outside were boot prints. In the mud. I didn’t recognize the make but it looked like the size of a fully grown man and not a child. 

“Outside.” 

The whisper felt like it was right into my ear. It was so close but so silent that it made my skin crawl. My nerves were set on fire. Outside where? Outside the window or outside in the hall? I walked over to the door and glanced down the dark hallway. Still nothing. A headache began in the back of my head but I wouldn’t sleep until this was resolved. 

The hallway is long and along the left side of it are windows. This time however the windows weren’t empty. There was something obscuring them. It seemed to be some sort of mud or liquid. It was red. In a child’s handwriting each window had a word written on it. 

The. 

Night. 

Is. 

Cold. 

I was confused. Was there a crazy person outside? Was someone fucking with me? My head began to hurt even more and that made me angry. I decided to call the police even though I knew it was a fruitless effort. They would take ages to get up here and by then whoever was harassing us might’ve already disappeared. I walked down the hallway and looked for my phone that I had left in the kitchen. Across from the kitchen was the main room where my mother was still playing. I could hear the flipping of cards in there. I called the police but I was interrupted by another whisper. 

“Not here.”

This voice was starting to really piss me off. I didn’t know what it wanted and I wanted it to go away. My head was pounding and I wanted to go to bed and have this resolved. My phone kept ringing and I couldn’t get through. I started to talk to myself to calm myself down. Yk stuff like calm down and this is all just in your head. But I was interrupted once more. 

“Not in your head but in front of you.”

This time I didn’t get angry. I looked up. There was nothing there but the entrance to the main room. My mom hadn’t stopped flipping the cards yet. No she was still going. But it was too rhythmic. 

Flip. Flip. Flip. Flip. 

It didn’t really sound like cards. It sounded more like water dripping maybe? At this point I felt like my head was splitting apart. I continued on and thought maybe the voice was trying to get me to talk to my mom? Maybe to get some pain medication? Maybe to go to the doctor?

I stumbled forward and grasped at the door. I managed to open it and what greeted me was a waft of sticky warm air. The flipping was in fact the sound of liquid dripping. It just wasn’t water. The liquid ran from the table. It soaked the cards from the deep wound that had been torn in my mother’s neck. Her eyes looked at me. There was absolutely nothing behind them. I had never in my life seen such an expressionless face. I stumbled backwards as my headache and shock overtook me. 

I woke up in a police station. Apparently our neighbors had checked on us and found my mother dead and me passed out on the floor. I was suspected but I tried to tell them that it must’ve been whoever was whispering to me. I’m currently in some sort of interrogation room? The two thoughts that keep spinning around my head are why whoever had murdered my mom directed me to her. Was this some sort of sick game? The other thought is the last thing I saw before everything went black. I fell and hit my head hard but before that I saw the door. The door that led outside. And right next to the door were my boots. Covered in fresh mud. "
"""Quilting"" as a runway category",rupaulsdragrace,1i9ulto,2025-01-25 14:18:42,0,0.28,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/1i9ulto/quilting_as_a_runway_category/,lil-egg,Season 17,"Idk about y'all but I feel like quilting is usually requires a lot of time and attention to detail to execute well. So I'm not sure why production decided to give this as a runway challenge for season 17 girls who do not have access to the time, resources, and designers who could do these looks justice.
I think that's why most of the queens had very simple or basically no quilting in their looks. The queens who had more personally meaningful quilts in their look like Onya and Acacia didn't have that much material to work with. This seems like the type of challenge for an all stars budget, I really feel for the queens who struggled this week on the runway. "
I only the date the top % of men and you should too!,WomenDatingOverForty,1i9uf7e,2025-01-25 14:10:47,26,0.91,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1i9uf7e/i_only_the_date_the_top_of_men_and_you_should_too/,No-Map6818,Story Time,"I admit the title is click bait for the lurkers but the truth is that 99% of men dating should remain single for the good of womankind. Out of the pile of men who should never, ever date, that leaves a tiny percentage of men that are even worthy of dating. 

These men are not Chads, the only Chads I ever saw on the apps were scammers. Searching for a man that met the bare minimum was an exercise in futility. There were no good men being swiped left on by me, they were lazy with their profile and bio, and not worth my time or attention. And then if there was a conversation they lacked basic conversation skills, the ability to plan a date and suffered from main character syndrome.

The rare man who had the ability to converse like someone not driven by sex (men who start with sex are for the streets, we all know about the orgasm gap) were rare. There were also the men who never saw beyond my appearance, they were exhausting. Sure, I had some fun when men pressed me for my number I would give them the # to a neighboring police department or animal shelter. I would make up information about myself; I had 15 children, I investigated online scams, and on and on, I quickly bored of these men. 

At first I laughed at the profiles scratching my head thinking how would any woman be attracted to this mess of a man! I shared their photos in a group chat, but my laughing turned to heavy sighs of man after man offering absolutely nothing. This was not about matching with men, this was about not finding a man who was attractive **and** had a good profile. 

Then came all of the vetting because we all know women need to choose better! /s I quickly found out there was no better, there was not even a *not so horrible choice*. I never met a man that offered a fraction of what I offered, the man I dated the longest was the closest, but I had to settle in some areas.  

What is the measure of a man? According to men it is below the bare minimum, it is women settling, gentle parenting and over accommodating fragile egos. Men *think* they are good, but they are really not suitable for a healthy happy relationship. 

Men are the ones [reaching up](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/197hk61/comment/ki1ycwf/) in dating, overestimating their appearance and IQ (statistically), completely underestimating how bad they are as partners. I follow a few dating subs and am enjoying reading more and more men saying they are not coming across women, just bots and scammers, this makes my heart happy because that means more women are leaving OLP. 

Never settle ladies, you will always pay with the quality and quantity of your life.

Cheers!"

"I had no concept of someone being nice to me  for ulterior motives, or the meaning of exploitation and manipulation, because I was so love starved.   Not realizing that the whole purpose of denying someone care, withholding love.......is to weaken your resolve, make you compliant, docile, and weak.",CPTSD,1i9ucs4,2025-01-25 14:07:53,6,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1i9ucs4/i_had_no_concept_of_someone_being_nice_to_me_for/,Goodtogo_5656,,"Maybe not all abusers are like this, but my Mother was.   Being actively starved of love, doesnt  just make you compliant , docile, weak, but also  terrified,  desperate, and shame based.  Willing to accept anything.   She knew how to get what she wanted, studied your weaknesses, and then used them to her advantage.   She was inhuman, indifferent to your suffering. As long as she could find a way to get what she wanted; compliance, blind obedience, control, ....whatever way she found that worked .... it didnt matter how unlovable you felt, or how it hurt you, or what you went without.

I was reflecting on the feeling of desperation.  If you've ever felt desperate, you'll know that you don't have the best judgement.  If you think you're totally unlovable , and you're suffering, drowning in a pool of your own Shame, you don't stop to question whatever kindness comes your way.  I felt like a desperate child, constantly being baited with puppies to get inside a van.......by my own Mother.   So why would the idea of ""Stranger"" , or people with ulterior motives....mean anything to me?  I was living with that suspicion in my heart and trying to snuff it out, every day....just to survive and get some scrap of attention.      

I feel like I was the poster child for future assault victim, because I didn't know how to tell, decipher, potential attacker, from someone I need attention from.       I was just thinking about this the other day, and blown away that a full grown adult, doesnt' understand basic boundaries , never having had any healthy experiences with normal attachment, or any attachment.   It was either being totally ignored, abused, conned and lied to, or totally enmeshed -in this emotionally incestuous dynamic where I had no identity, or self.   Being raised by a con artist, controlling abuser, .....posing as a parent and calling herself ""Mother""..

It basically broke whatever gut instinct that tells you ""unsafe person"", because you had to override it every day. It makes me livid just thinking about the fact I was forced to trust, a psychopath.  Call it whatever, Stockholm syndrome, it's not even a choice.   You have one caregiver, and they're also your abuser,  and  the person exploiting you, and the person parentifying you and trying to extract every resource from you by using psychological warfare, starving you of love and attention until you're so desperate and weak,   You'll do anything , accept any behavior,  just  to make the suffering stop.

Whatever form that suffering came; withholding all love and attention, the silent treatment, hostility and violence.    This is your parent maneuvering your humanity and innocence, to serve them,  having your mammalian drive for attachment, basically weaponized against you.   It really fucks with your sense of self protection, autonomy, survival instincts, ....living with a predator.  I think it's okay that I may have this overdeveloped self protective mechanism now, ..................where I don't trust anyone.   No one.

Whatever attachment you have is traumatized attachment.   So when one day they decide to be nice to you, you're so desperate for the attention, it doesnt matter if they're throwing peanuts at you like youre an elephant,   you've been groomed to believe it's all you deserve.    The whole thing is set up in a way, so that you accept as little care as possible, (making it easy on them of course) even though you need so much more.   You don't even know how wrong it is, how blameless you are, what you're being denied.  Good days was when I was the most invisible, the last thing I wanted was attention, until  you can't take it anymore, and start to self destruct....at least then you can feel the pain of the deprivation and assault against yourself, maybe then someone will notice-not that you realize that's what you're doing.

So when someone was nice to me, I was groomed to accept it, whatever form that came in,   having been  love starved from the beginning. Never thinking about who they were, or if I had a right to decide if they were safe, *never* realizing I had a choice.  Youre not picky; safe love, unsafe love, manipulative love, love that cons  you , cheats you, you'll take it all.     No concept that strangers  could be in fact untrustworthy and dangerous-no understanding of the meaning of ""stranger"", because in reality I had no relationship, zero attachment other than a trauma bonded one, so   Why would I understand any other person as ""outsider"" when I was essentially living with a predator who never recognized me as her offspring that she should protect and care for?  Why would I even notice that a person at that point was ""unsafe"" or a ""stranger"", when I didnt have a safe loving attachment with anyone, and the person I was calling ""Mother"" was this unpredictable person , who was basically a stranger to me ......*because she was never the same person  two days in a row??!!*

""My Mother"" was no more a mother to me, than any other con artist that saw me as nothing more than someone to take from, or abuse.   So why would I be able to decipher stranger, from the vacant, remorseless, indifferent Monster that i was living with every day.....calling herself ""Mother"" to manipulate me?  Like Pavlovs' dog, all I had to hear or believe, simply because she gave birth to me, that this was a ""Mother"" so that whatever else happened there, must have been okay, warranted, deserved.    Basically being groomed to be a victim, only I didnt know that.

She wasn't a MOTHER, just because she gave birth to me, looked like a Mother, pretended to be a Mother or affectively conned  the entire world into believing she gave a shit about her children and knew how take care of them.     It's why I often got pulled in by laughing, cheating, charming , assholes that had ulterior motives, because it was what I knew.   My position , or brain was taught to believe ""well at some point they might do something shitty, but I'll get something in the process, at least I'm not totally abandoned"". This is the only ""Love"" I knew.....and honestly....I never saw it until it was too late.  OR, I chose not to see it, overrode my instincts, terrified if I didnt' accept this, I'd get nothing.

I didnt' know ""manipulation"", but  I felt it on these ""happier"" days, looking at my Mother suspiciously , that fake ass charm,  being too afraid to ask ""what about the other day when you went bat shit crazy on me for no reason, are we even going to talk about that?!""...No, never happened.  This is ""New"" and improved Mom, I should just accept that, this stranger that she cultivated overnight, for whatever reason.

It messes with all your relationships.   How do I know that this kindness, this ""good treatment"" that I'm accepting, isnt' going to bite me in the ass one day?

I""m astonished, and appalled, that I had no understanding of ""person who may later attack me"".   Or  As a woman, ""man who wants something other than my friendship"".  No one had that conversation with me.  How is that possible, that my own parents never sat me down and explained that to me? Or, Asked who my friends were, wanted to meet them, to see if they wanted to use me as a drug mule, or sell me to gypsies?     The sad thing is , you'll accept whatever love you get.  And the longer you have no clue what real love is, what actual care is, the longer you go without what you authentically need, the more deprived you are, ....... the less deserving you feel.  Now you're just feral and awkward , and unlovable, and addicted to whatever cheap ass version you've been brainwashed and groomed to accept.  Even if there was someone there willing to give you what you need, I don't necessarily know what to ask for??!!   AT least that's how I felt.   Like if you're too stupid not to understand abuse, exploitation, manipulation from actual love, then why should anyone extend it to you if you're too clueless to know the difference anyway?  You must not be worth it  if you don't have any sense of self worth, value, for who you are, or so worthless that you'd accept anything.

If you're starving , and someone offers you chocolate cake, you don't' say ""no, sugar is bad for me"", you devour the chocolate cake, and hope  you don't die.   It could be poisonous chocolate cake, you don't stop to check.  I feel ashamed, that I settled for so little, not having any idea there was anything else, or what that looked like, felt like, I just didn't know....genuine nurturing, care , love.  No idea or concept that  I deserved "" more"", than the scraps I was groomed to accept. Having no clue or idea what ""more"" even meant?  And too afraid to ask.

It's hard to admit that you've gone without genuine Love and care for so long, that you've adapted yourself to it,  no clue what you actually missed,  believing that you deserved nothing. If  it somehow inadvertently shows up and gets beyond all your defense mechanisms,  I have  to find a way to keep myself  from dissolving into a puddle of grief.....and repulsing people with my deprivation, and vulnerability.  I have to pretend, act like someone who's had this love all along.

Edit: And being afraid to ask, or cultivating an understanding of what you might need or require, fearing not getting it, or finding out you're not worth it, or it's too much to ask, and what you went without for so long is so vast.....that you've lost it forever."
I (37F) don't feel like a priority to my fiancé (35M) - how do I reconnect with him?,relationship_advice,1i9ubji,2025-01-25 14:06:25,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9ubji/i_37f_dont_feel_like_a_priority_to_my_fiancé_35m/,DisasterUnicorn957,,"I feel like I'm the lowest priority in my fiancé's life, and I don't know what to do about it. This is a long one, but I think the context is important.

Fiancé (I'll call him J) and I have been together for three years, living together for two and a half, and we were friends for about a year before becoming a couple. Things were amazing in the beginning - he was attentive and affectionate, and showed me every day that I was important to him. He even wrote me a poem about how much I mean to him. I couldn't imagine being happier. From the start he was an equal partner, handling all the cooking and half of the housekeeping. I have a child from a previous relationship who lives with us (bio dad is barely involved and lives in another state) and J has stepped up to become an amazing dad. I never pushed their relationship, it happened very naturally and they clearly adore each other.

After about a year together, we decided try moving to a different area. When we got there I found it easy to get a job (I have a BA, he has gone to college but didn't finish, so on paper he only has HS) and the stress of being a sahd and not being a ""provider"" for his family got to him. I always reassured him that his work at home was just as valuable as mine, and that I didn't mind that it was taking him longer to find a paying job. Not only did it not help, him feel better, he said I was invalidating his feelings. He did eventually find work, but the entire year in that state was stressful for so many reasons, and our relationship became strained. When our lease was up we moved back to where we came from.

When we got back I immediately started working, and again it took him a few months to find something (which again caused him immense stress), but he eventually did and has worked consistently since then. I also have a commission-based job that I schedule myself, but it takes at least a couple hours weeknights and weekends. His relationship with our child is just as good, but ours is still struggling. He still cooks and helps with our child, but does basically no housework or family management. I do all the logistical stuff - paying bills and tracking money, making and keeping appointments, keeping track of the shopping list, keeping track of our child's activities, and pretty much everything else you can think of to keep a home running. He doesn't even pick up after himself anymore - every day there are dirty socks and tissues all over the ground, and food mess on the counter and stove that I didn't leave there but I become responsible for cleaning. Lately he's even letting the cooking slide - we have dinner together a few nights a week, and the rest of the time he cooks something quick for himself and our child, and I do my own thing.  Our s3x life has suffered considerably because I'm stressed and tired. I know that's something that's very important to him (honestly me too, but I'm drowning so it's not the first thing on my mind anymore) so I might be an AH for not just getting over myself and doing it.

I admit, I'm needy. I want non-s3xual affection and sweetness daily. He tells me he loves me every day, but it would mean so much to hear WHY. Like what he loves about me, happy memories he has of us, things he'd like to do in the future. I want to feel like he's attracted to me, and not just that he wants s#x. I'd like a little romance, you know? Not all the time, but a little trickle every day. Instead I mostly get playful roughhousing and insults, and smacks on the @ ss.  When we do have s3x the focus is on meeting his needs and mine are usually forgotten. When we talk it's often him talking at me about a game or some history topic, neither of which are interesting to me at all, but I try to pay attention and ask questions. I don't bring up anything but our mutual interests anymore, because in the past when I wanted to talk about something I'm into, he wouldn't even look up from his phone and immediately forgot everything I said.

2024 was especially hard for me. J is really into board games, and his best game buddy lives two doors down. He's often over there on a weeknight for 4-6 hours, and weekends for that much or longer. In 2024 he forgot our anniversary and my birthday because he was gaming those days. Last winter I feel on the icy sidewalk and cut my face badly while he was over at his buddy's playing board games. I sent him a frantic SOS and he did come home to help me find my spare glasses, but after a few minutes he went back over to play, leaving me to deal with the injury. For Christmas I filled his stocking and bought him tickets to something he has always wanted to do, while he went shopping on Christmas Eve for whatever was available. He got me a few random things that are close to what I like but not quite, and a gag gift. Throughout the year if I see something I like, I point it out, and I'm not high maintenance - it's usually something like a simple necklace or a set of PJs. During arguments he has called me delusional, told me I make bad decisions, and heavily implied that I only cry to manipulate him. He's also accused me of gaslighting him because we remember things differently - I don't think I am, I think we just have different perspectives, but maybe I am and I just don't see it.

On top of this, he's very upset about my relationship with his family. He has a large extended family that lives nearby. I like them all fine and attend all the family events. Sometimes I moan and say I don't want to go, but so does he, and when it comes time to drive over I go without further complaint. It's not even that I don't want to see them, which I've made clear to him, I just prefer hanging out at home most of the time. When I do spend time with them, we get along, but we haven't really connected on a deep level. I like them but I don't love them, and I can't make love grow by willpower. He says ""I want you to be part of my family"" and acts like I'm intentionally rejecting them, which couldn't be further from the truth. I have no family of my own so I would be so happy if I integrated into his and we all loved each other, but it just isn't that way.

Another factor is that he works in a female-dominated field, so he has female friends from work. I don't mind that in theory, but he's often texting with them at home while I'm sitting on the other end of the couch watching reels and feeling ignored. He talks about them all the time, and if one of them texts while we're talking he'll cut me off to text them back.

We were supposed to get married last fall, but postponed due to finances (which are better now). He hasn't talked about setting a new date since then. I brought up needing a vacation recently, and he said we should go somewhere tropical - that was our honeymoon plan originally, but I guess now it's just a vacation. The other day I mentioned maybe just having a courthouse wedding, or something very small outside the courthouse, and just having a simple backyard reception for his family. He seemed really upset, and never gave me an answer. I somewhat understand because I've been married before so the wedding isn't as big a deal to me, while this is his first marriage. I'd rather use the money for a nice honeymoon, while he wants the wedding experience. But I couldn't help but feel on some level like the wedding is more important to him than being married to me. Maybe he feels like I'm trying to cut his family out because he thinks I don't want to be part of them?

Today he's at his buddy's place again, having game day. They're playing noon to 4ish, while I stay home and clean the house. We were supposed to spend the day together, especially because he had to work last weekend, but when his buddy texted him this morning about gaming, he dropped our plans in an instant. I feel lonely, isolated, frustrated, and unloved right now. I have one good friend who I have spent one day with in the year+ since we moved back, and no hobbies. I'm too stressed and tired to visit my friend or engage in hobbies most of the time. He tells me I've also stopped doing the small things that make him feel loved, and he's right, I need to be better about that.

To be fair there's a lot to love about him. He's an amazing cook and an even better dad. He He works hard to support us. He does all the driving because I don't like to and carries all the heavy stuff. He brings me coffee when we're home together in the morning. He takes our child to her appointments and activities at least half the time. He supports my evening/weekend job, which I'm trying to work into being my full time career so I can quit my 9-5. He encourages me in my hobbies (though as I said, I don't really have the energy for them right now). There's also a lot about me that isn't great. I can be moody and depressed, I'm not super enthusiastic lately about leaving the house to try new things together, I get cranky at times, I clam up about my feelings (I don't speak up much because I'm a crier when talking about feelings, and it really bothers him), and  I can get really frustrated and snappy about the housework and such at times. I've also said some awful things to him during arguments, and I haven't found a way to apologize that is meaningful to him.

I love this man, but idk what to do anymore. I know he loves me and he mean well. I know he's not cheating. I understand how important his family is to him. I appreciate him so much for raising a child who isn't his biologically with complete love and acceptance. I appreciate his hard work to provide for us, and his willingness to take over the cooking. I adore his sense of humor, his adventurous spirit, his nerdiness, his intelligence, and so much more. I love how he runs to the door to greet me when I get home from work, and the kiss he gives me every night when we go to bed. I can't imagine my life without him in it. I wonder if he even cares whether I'm in his life, or if I'm interchangeable with any other partner who would provide s#x and home management services.

How do I move past this? I don't know how to be playful and fun, the way he needs me to be in order to connect with me. I can't drop either of my jobs right now, and I can't drop the housework and such because there's no one to pick it up, and I have a child to consider. I want so much for him to prioritize me and really love me again, and I want him to feel loved in return. What can I do to help us reconnect?

Edit: Therapy isn't an option. We're in an area with very limited services. Almost no one takes I surance, and we can't afford self pay. the one place that does take our insurance has a two year waitlist. Also he doesn't trust/believe in therapy and likely wouldn't participate even if we found someone."
How is 10 years not enough?,lostlove,1i9u92s,2025-01-25 14:03:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostlove/comments/1i9u92s/how_is_10_years_not_enough/,harshregret,,"This is insanely long, and if no one reads it I will accept that. Just feels nice to put it out there to the universe in a sub where people might understand. 

    I still remember the first time I met you in the McDonalds break room when we were 16/17. We talked about everything from music to religion and family, and it felt like talking to someone I've known for years. I spent the next 3 years getting to know you as a friend. When we talked about what we wanted for the future and you were always so nurturing and enthusiastic. You took my small scraps of hope and snippets of ideas and fleshed them out into plans with your encouragement and help.

    There were so many close calls for us being together. When I told our mutual friend I wasn't into you, I thought I was saving myself the embarrassment of having my feelings be one sided. I never knew that you had asked him to see how I felt because you liked me. Eventually we both fell into on again off again relationships with other people but somehow were never ""off"" at the same time. In conversation with that same mutual friend later on it came up how much I used to like you. I found out that the feelings were mutual and you never stopped having feelings for me. 
    
    You broke up with your girlfriend soon after (not sure if this was why). I broke up with my boyfriend probably 3 times over the next 4 months, trying to end things as gently as I could. It was about this time that you messaged me at 1AM one night and told me that you hoped my boyfriend knew how lucky he was to have me in his life... Except it was him that saw that message instead of me. He knew at that point why our relationship had suddenly stopped working. I told the truth that we liked each other. I think his heart was broken. He asked for me to not leave him. Asked for me to not throw away what we had made over the last 2 1/2 years. I shouldn't have let my guilt hold together the relationship. I knew it was wrong to stay when my feelings for him had passed, but I was young and he was the first person in my life to show me what it felt like to be loved unconditionally. To hurt someone that loved me that much made me feel ungrateful for having something like that in the first place, especially for a first relationship. 

    The relationship maybe lasted another 4 months. After I finally found the strength to break things off with him for good I thought I finally had my chance to see where we could lead. He cried and asked if it was ending it over you. I will never get over the guilt I had in that moment. After that I waited for you to message me. Everytime I thought about finding you I kept thinking about all the times me and my ex fought over you and how much I had hurt him to leave. Somehow it made me feel like if I sought you out, I was betraying him even further. 

    Three months had gone by with no word from you and I was so sure that you had given up on me. I mean in the whole time we knew each other we never even kissed (we did come close ONE time when I was leaving your house, but i got cold feet when I realized your little sister was watching from the next room, lol and that was YEARS ago). We no longer worked together and I was not allowed to have your number in my phone or talk to you so when I was with Matt so it had already beens months since hearing from you. I should have found someone to give me your number. After you had put yourself out there months ago why was I still so afraid to go to you?

    A little while later I went on a date with a guy from my new job, he was smart, older, and had his life together. He wasn't you, but by that point you still hadn't messaged me and I figured that you probably hated me for staying with my ex after that night you messaged me. It was time to move on. When he got an out of town promotion and asked me to move there with him after only 3 months, I said yes. Probably should have seen the red flag at that point but my home life was chaotic and stressful anyway, what was there to lose? 

The next 6 months was the lowest point in my life. About a month after moving in together, all the love in the relationship stopped. I spent most nights crying alone while he sat in the other room ignoring me. I was such an idiot. There was always a part of me that hated myself and I felt like I deserved what I was now going through. I felt trapped. I had just found a new job and needed the money. I couldn't afford to live on my own. Anywhere. Even working full time. I looked. Even studio apartments were insane. I didn't want to move back home because that was a loud chaotic hell vs the silent and cold one I was now in. So I stayed. Maybe I could make him love me again if I looked nicer? Or cleaned the house better? Or if I stopped asking for so much attention? I made excuses for his lack of love and I held on dearly to the few small moments of attention he gave me. I became that person that people always judge. 

    It stayed like that for a long time. Too long. Then one day I found your message only because Google was overrun and angry with my unchecked inbox. It was sent soon after me and my ex broke up asking if I would be willing to go out on a date with you because ""dating is fun"" and amazing when it is with someone you already like. You sent another similar message asking for my number a little bit later because apparently my ex had messaged you asking for you to delete my number out of respect for the relationship. So you did. So you had emailed me for a date after we broke up. Wtf. At that point I checked my other social media pages that I never used. Pinterest messages! I didn't even know where the damn inbox was. But then I read them. The messages were sent a year and a half ago, probably 7 months after my ex and I broke up. 

    The messages were sent around the same time that I spent my nights crying. You said that you were sorry for bugging me after months but you just really felt like we had something special and that you liked me when you knew me and that you were sure if we were to get to know each other again your feelings would still be there. How cruel that the universe would let this message get lost in translation at the time it could have changed everything. But then I saw the next message and spent the next three days crying. In that next message you told me your dad had died over Christmas and that you were in a really dark place. You told me that you missed me even just as a friend but would finally leave me alone. I will never get over the ache in my heart for not being there for you. The thought of you thinking that I might have ignored you when you were hurting kills me. I know that darkness. To know someone i loved was walking through it destroyed me. 

    All of the shame of what I had let my life become came back to me.

    I didn't know what to do at that point. I should have found you to explain everything and prayed you could forgive me. You had such a kind nature that you might have. But I didn't send that message. I was so ashamed that I let myself move on so quick from you. Embarrassed that I allowed myself to accept scraps of affection- in return for my soul that had now been so badly damaged by normalizing emotional neglect. I was afraid that you would never see me with any respect again. I cried for your pain and I cried mourning us and what we could have been. We could have saved each other from so much pain. I told myself once I got my life together I would find the courage to message you. 

    The longer I waited, the harder it got to send. Looking back, not messaging you will always be one of my life's biggest regrets. Not leaving the ball in your court to decide what you wanted when you were likely still grieving. I did decide to enroll in nursing school that year, but had a long three years to go for my degree. I did stay with the a-hole so I would have somewhere to live while I worked part time and was enrolled in full time school. That was a dumb choice, because the longer I stayed the shittier my self esteem got and therefore the harder it was to leave him. But at least I was taking steps in the right direction. I was only 23 at the time. At the time 23 felt grown up. I felt like a failure because I was supposed to have everything figured out.

    A year or so later I saw that same mutual friend while I was at work. He asked about how my life was and if I had met anyone. At that point I was still with the same man. When I told him I was in a relationship he didn't pry too much. I wanted to ask about you but I thought I would have another chance to ask since he said that he shopped there ""all the time"". In the several years I worked at that store, basically full time across multiple shifts I never saw him before or since. Is it really possible that it was a coincidence? You guys were basically best friends back in the day. Always makes me wonder.

    After I was almost finished with nursing school and had a job lined up I decided to move back home. But by now probably 6 years had passed. It was too late. There was no way to explain away my absence and the dead silence over 6 years. When I make myself admit it, it was a choice to not message. I had put you onto a pedestal and was terrified that either my destructive tendencies or simply reality would ruin it. Then again maybe you would have been the love of my life and I let you go without the fight you deserved. 

    Somehow my choice to leave my a-hole hole boyfriend made him realize that he actually liked me. He moved back to the area and asked me to stay with him. I did. I told myself that I had accepted letting you go. If I wasn't with you I might as well stay with him. The relationship did get better eventually once I grew a backbone and put up boundaries. Thankfully he makes an effort now and even treats me pretty well. We got married and even had a child together. When we had our kid I was genuinely surprised by how much joy it has brought to him. He smiles and laughs now for the love of our son. I have forgiven him for the years of pain since he is a great dad to our son but I don't think I can ever fully move past those first awful years. He is a good teammate now, but I will never feel for him the way I did you. 

    I still think about you a lot. I did become a nurse just like we talked about. I got my shit together. My life is pretty much how I imagined, well, except for you. I don't know why but recently I did look you up on social media and have never seen you with what looks like a significant other. You look a lot different than you used to but somehow I just can't shake the desire to reach out. I want to send a message back to you after all these years (almost 10) and find out if you still need a friend even if it can't be like it used to. It probably makes me a shitty person but I don't know if I can ever be totally satisfied and move on in life living with all the what ifs. They run through my mind on repeat more often than I would like to admit

What if I had been brave enough to kiss you that night? What if I had been brave enough to tell Daren that I liked you from the moment we met? What if I had been the one to see the message you sent me that night? What if I had loved myself enough to understand that I deserved to be happy?

   What if I had seen ANY ONE of the fucking messages you sent me after the breakup?

What if I could have gotten over my fear and shame and reached back out to you years ago? You might not have wanted anything to do with me but I will probably never know now. The universe is kinda messed up sometimes. I don't know that I will ever have the courage to reach out (probably not healthy for either of us anyway). But I do want to thank you Jesse. Even when I didn't love myself, knowing that you saw me as important and special made me want to better myself and live up to the potential you once saw in me."
💎 3 Hidden Gems Set to Dominate 2025,CryptoMoon,1i9u8jn,2025-01-25 14:02:56,37,0.94,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1i9u8jn/3_hidden_gems_set_to_dominate_2025/,gamer_paradiser,MEMECOIN,"Hey everyone, Ark here!

The crypto market may be unpredictable, but that’s where some of the best opportunities lie. I’ve been tracking three standout projects - $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE. These projects are building serious momentum and offer unique value propositions for 2025. Here’s why you should keep them on your radar:

# $PLATH (SOL) – Conservation with a Twist

https://preview.redd.it/hoiv3fwrl6fe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f21ca407d2e24cb919017c7b5bb1b8a60ed2f9ab

**$PLATH** is bridging the gap between innovation and impact. Their charitable focus on adopting endangered platypuses (21 and counting) through the WWF sets them apart, while their commitment to environmental stability hints at a broader charity roadmap for 2025.

But it’s not all about giving back - $PLATH has fun, too. Their Telegram and Reddit bots (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?) and upcoming NFTs add a layer of engagement for the community. Combine that with a strong team of diamond-handed whales, constant token burns, top-holder airdrops, and this project has serious long-term potential.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.1M
* **Strengths:** Charitable initiatives, original art, strong community engagement.
* **Targets:** Potential for a 2x-3x short-term, with significant long-term promise.

# $CATBAT (SOL) – The Crypto Space Protector

https://preview.redd.it/lg034ns4m6fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d121c7353831f6c5ad5e7eda7ca63ae1cf7ed003

**$CATBAT** is not just a token; it’s a mission-driven initiative to clean up the crypto space. From developing ScamScout, a tool to help users avoid scams, to offering a unique rugged coin redemption platform, they’re tackling real issues head-on.

Daily token burns, top-holder airdrops, and partnerships with other major projects add to its appeal. Plus, the dev has locked his token supply for a year, building trust and ensuring stability for the community.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.7M
* **Strengths:** Anti-scam tools, daily burns, strong roadmap.
* **Targets:** ATH at 4M, with fast growth as tools roll out.

**Contract Address:** mo7mapMrCsyci5w1td1wgrKPtNeCfjfkKi96DknWi5N  
**Telegram:** @ CATBATPORTAL  
**Reddit:** r/ CATBAT

# $PYRATE (SOL) – Charting New Waters in Crypto

**$PYRATE** isn’t just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. From a rich storyline featuring characters and comics to a pfp builder web app and ocean-cleaning charity initiatives, this project is all about innovation and engagement.

With over 170K users of its Telegram bot, CEX listings on the way, and paid promotions kicking off soon, $PYRATE is positioning itself for explosive growth. Plus, their focus on community gaming (Minecraft and more) is a fun way to strengthen their loyal crew.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 790K
* **Strengths:** Expanding ecosystem, charity initiatives, engaged community.
* **Targets:** Near-term 1.5M, with potential for previous ATHs (3M) and beyond.

**Final Thoughts**  
The crypto market may feel like a rollercoaster at times, but it’s these fast-moving, dynamic environments where big gains are made. Whether you’re here for the memes, the mission, or the innovation, $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE all bring something unique to the table.

Is it normal to stop what you’re doing every 2 hours to entertain your dog?,DogAdvice,1i9u4xf,2025-01-25 13:58:52,6,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1i9u4xf/is_it_normal_to_stop_what_youre_doing_every_2/,vivemelior,Discussion,"Idk if I’ve created attention hounds but it seems like every 2 hours, regardless of how much or little we do previously my dogs will get up and bother me to do something with them. 

I probably created this expectation because in trying to keep them mentally enriched I would make up games or do training throughout the day, especially when it is too cold to be outside for long. So now they sort of just expect that if I’m in the room that they can come to me for entertainment.  

If I put myself away in a room and close the door or leave the house they will just chill and nap. But if I’m around it’s like I HAVE to do something with them. 

My dogs are probably higher energy breeds so I get that they’re not gonna nap all day, but I also read that even active dogs sleep a lot. I love hanging out with my dogs but also sometimes I want to just chill and watch tv or play games. And if I’m working it’s disruptive as I have to basically stop working even if Im super focused and it breaks my day up a lot to the point where I just feel like life is happening in 1-hr increments between dog walks and playtime. 

I feel bad complaining about it but I feel like my life is backwards where my dogs dictate what I do and when I do it. I wfh so I’m with them basically 24-7. My parents say it’s unhealthy that my entire life and schedule revolves around them. At first I was offended but now I think it might actually be a problem. "

a tactical jet skibidi toilet goes in and drops two acid bombs on top of Titan Radioman destroying one of his speakers before microphone titan grabs him and crushes its head throwing it to the ground but Titan Radioman did not seem happy

  


Titan Radioman: **COWARD**

  


his eye turns red and he goes on a rampage turning on his rage mode as he goes in grabbing toilets and using them to destroy others crushing them into guts as he got closer and closer but necromancer laughed as he teleported away and got even further still giving them the middle finger 



  
Titan Radioman: ***WHY ARE YOU RUNNING-***

  


Microphone Titan holds his shoulder: WAIT! This is his plan! He's trying to get us away from the clock tower. It's gonna be defenseless, we are very far away now!

  


Titan Radioman calms down his eye going back to being green: you're right…let's go

  


They both go away at fast speeds back towards the clock tower to help Titan camera toilet defend the tower. As the necromancer saw them go away he laughed: HA HA HA **this is too fun for me.**

  


Back to Titan Cassetteman he saw the Female 04 and Uber Dreadnought fight each other before he heard titan speakermans screams!: OH CRAP! I completely forgot about the others! i need to go help him

  


**the fact this is the 2nd time this happens he he ;D -zealous**

  


he flies towards titan speakmans direction whos caught in quite the risky situation with one of the horror toilets holding him while the other one tried to chainsaw his neck off

Titan camera toilet defends the clock tower fighting an incinerator skibidi bathtub that shot fire from its tub towards him shooting its laser cannons and its nuke launchers towards him but with his bubble plasma shield he easily blocked it! now that dr richards mech was destroyed he had regained his plasma weapons!  as he stops using the shield and goes in with his plasma sword stabbing one of the heads he then turns the plasma sword off and uses his new chainsaw hand to cut another head off as he then does a spin and punches a hole through the last head pulling his fist out as it falls to the ground dead

  


the elites were too injured to keep on fighting and the alliance found themselves surrounded their forces being taken more and more towards big ben as they lost ground

  


Plungerman: This is bad, they are getting too close to the tower.

  


Medic Cameraman: well we can't make progress in pushing them back when you and the others keep returning here for heals

  


Plungerman: We’ll, ok that's true.But still, they are too relentless despite their casualties

  


Filipino TV Man: masyado kang nasaktan para makipaglaban plungerman! Ako ang nasa pinakamainam na kondisyon ngayon kaya ako na lalaban sa kanila, mamatay man… (you're too injured to fight plungerman! i'm the one at best conditions right now i'll hold all those mutant backs even if it costs me my life)

  


Plungerman: you aren't in the best conditions either…we are all on this together you know?

  


A huge explosion happens as they see the titan hunter and arctic mutant breaking structures and killing entire squads of alliance members in the street..especially titan hunter who seems very angry they could also see the buzzsaw mutant who was more busy overlooking the air forces of the alliance shooting them down himself!

  


however a terrifying roar is heard! one that makes everyone stop!

  


Titan Radioman and Microphone Titan saw it as they made their way towards the clock tower

  


titan camera toilet heard the sound

  


titan Casseteman made his way towards titan speakerman and saw it kinda shocked

  


Titan Speakerman stopped being sawed on by the horror toilets because they themselves were terrified of the roars that were being heard

  


Malware and Behemoth stopped fighting as they turned to see what that sound was

  


Uber Champion and Uber Overlord who were menacingly walking towards the now defenseless male 05 were also distracted and taken at back by the sound.

  


and even more the regular soldiers who were all terrified by the noise and soon enough they see who it is as it drills from the ground and reveals itself!

THE LAST BACKUP TITAN OF THE ALLIANCE FOR THIS MISSION IS HERE TITAN DRILLMAN IMMEDIATELY ROARS OPENING ITS MOUTH AS IT THEN DRILLS THE GROUND!

  


EARTHQUAKES HAPPEN ALL AROUND THE BATTLEFIELD! MAKING THE UBER TOILETS RETREAT TITAN HUNTER GOING AWAY IN ANGER HAVING TO BE HOLD BACK BY ARTIC UBER MUTANT SO THEY COULD GET OUT

  


THE CONSTANT DRILLING IN THE GROUND ALSO CREATES SOME SPIKES IN THE GROUND SOME WHICH STAB THE TOILET THAT WAS HOLDING TITAN SPEAKERMAN



  
ANOTHER EARTH SPIKE GET IN THE WAY OF THE UBER TITANS MAKING THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE DEFENSELESS DOG

  


MALWARE GETS HIT BY ONE OF THESE SPIKES LOSING HIS ARM AND BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM BEHEMOTH SINCE HE HAD TO FLY AWAY FROM THE EARTHQUAKES 

  


RISING LAVA SHOOTING OUT OF SOME OF THE SPOTS MAKE FEMALE 04 AND UBER DREADNOUGHT STOP FIGHTING BOTH OF THEM GETTING AWAY FROM THE LAVA

  


TITAN DRILLMANS FIRST MOVE HAD SINGLEHANDELY CHANGED THE GAME AS SEVERAL TOILETS FROM BOTH THE TOILET EMPIRE AND THE SKIBIDI ALLIANCE WERE KILLED BY THE EARTHQUAKES,SPIKES AND LAVA



 TITAN SPEAKERMAN FREES HIMSELF AND PUNCHES THE TOILET WHO IMMEDIATELY TAKES HIS ATTENTION OFF TITAN SPEAKERMAN AND GOES TOWARDS THE TITAN DRILLMAN!

  


however as it made its way to the beast it was not surprised by the toilet as it opened its chest cavity and shot out chains from them that stabbed onto the toilet's head! He tries to saw them off with his chainsaws but it just doesn't work! as he gets dragged to titan drillmans core and gets crushed!

  


and Titan Drillman isnt done yet! as it roars and digs into the ground to attack any giant skibidi toilets.

  


Plungerman looks out at the mess from the window of one of the many buildings some alliance members were inside of

  


Plungerman: dang, that kid got some Upgrades?

  


Medic Cameraman: WAIT THAT THINGS A KI-

  


back to the skibidi alliance female 04 holds male 05 and male 02 on what was left of her arms both of her friends lacking a lot of limbs they knew that it was done for dr richard trigger himself ordering a retreat as they teleport away and all the skibidi alliance forces make their way out.

  


Female 04: Skibidis… Fall back.



  
back to malware he orders a retreat as he sees titan drillman who had just grabbed a skibidi toilet and ate it whole opening its drill mouth and forces from the speakermen and ESPECIALLY the pencilmen were covering ground too

  


Malware: everybody retreat!! we'll deal with that thing later.

  


they all proceed to either teleport away or fly away from the ensuing battle the uber titans were the ones most triggered by the retreat as that's something they really don't like but the very injured uber sorceress had teleported to take them out of there

Uber Sorceress: so i'm not the only one who's had a tough day huh? hehe



  
Uber Champion: just get us to the goddamn base

  


Uber Dreadnought and uber overlord do a fist bump despite the circumstances because why not?

  


They quickly teleport out of there as the titan drillman gets rid of any troops in the way with the titans joining in to help too! except titan Casseteman who was stabilizing titan Speakermans awful injuries.

  


**back inside the clock tower**

  


This begins playing:-  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnkImtI\_J9E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnkImtI_J9E)

  


The future clockman was silent and the phantom was as well before suddenly they rushed at fast speeds! destroying entire parts of the clock tower mostly phantoms fault who wanted to create as much collateral damage as possible while fighting the future clockman

  


Ketzy and clockwoman were both shocked, staring at the fight unfold they were going too fast for them to perceive what was going on tho but that's why you got me here to narrate dontcha? my homie future clockman punches the air creating a lot of holograms made out of magic of his fist as they shoot out as projectiles! however phantom rushes past them and whatever projectiles were fast enough to do so she would create a shield made out of the ground with her telekinesis to block the attacks

  


she then suddenly goes at even faster speeds and even tho it was only for one second it was enough to appear in front of future clockman and then hold him down with her telekinesis to the ground she then stabs his shoulders

  


Phantom: where's that clock strider you love so much? I expected it to be here.

  


Future Clockman: i trust it with a friend. Besides, why do you even know that?

  


he headbutts her away then knee kicks her in the face and grabs her by the head throwing it to the ground as it cracks only for phantom to shoot some white lasers that suddenly appear out of nowhere and make future clockman back off fire spreading on his body from the attack



  
Phantom gets up: ho my friend..don't you understand? I know a lot that these feeble mortals never would.

  


Future Clockman rushes in and tries to punch Phantom but she just creates a barrier made out of the ground and random rubble around the battlefield which is all slowly enticing the clock tower as phantom looks at him emotionless

  


Phantom: I'm surprised you can even use clock powers in the first place..what exactly are you?

  


she notices something…when she had stabbed future clockman earlier..due to the fact he was melting she finds some pieces of him attached to her claws as suddenly they begin to burn and explode before she then gets kicked in the face into the ground tho she creates hands made out of rock as they punch future clockman away

  


Phantom: So you're definitely not normal even by the standards of this world…you must know something that a lot of these idiots don't…

  


Future Clockman tries to kick her down but she dodges as she looks at him

  


Phantom: i recognize who you are…i've never seen you before but there's a huge chance my friend did and i must say **im disappointed you feel a lot weaker than what he described**

  


**she begins shooting a bunch of rubble and rocks towards my friend at fast speeds! it overwhelms him trapping him inside the pile of rocks and trying to crush him with it but the melting parts of him…they spread on the rocks and explode destroying them**

  


Future Clockman: i've got a lot of things to worry about than your tantrums-

  


he immediately gets his arm cut off by a steel beam from phantom

  


Phantom: you dare?

  


Future Clockman immediately heals himself: I do.



  
he dodges all the steel beams she threw at him tho one manages to actually slice the head off his body! and he falls to the ground into a white puddle

  


PHANTOM Toilet: PFFT its funny to see you talk trash and immediately regret it-

  


she is bothered by the fact that future clockmans soul appears and he heals his dead body as he goes back to it and he punches through a wall of rubble that phantom made to protect herself as it punches her face and throws her into the ground the melting parts of future clockman spreading on her face and head

  


future clockman: enough with you.

  


he creates some weird astral projections of himself as they then surround her and create a level 2 time stop in a smaller area! phantom finds himself unable to move but she can still speak and look around

  


phantom: (giggles sarcastically)..thats a funny trick 🙂

  


she breaks out of it with her magic

  


future clockman: surprising you face no struggle with that..there's a lot of ways to bypass time stop but they get lower and lower the higher the levels go your magic wouldn't work to bypass against level 3 no less.

  


Phantom: why should I care about your yapping?

  


Future Clockman: because you got a little spider on your head

  


the goo (it's shaped like a spider lol) in Phantom’s head melts her face and explodes! soon enough she comes out of the smoke angered half of her face missing black blood coming out of her it was almost like there was no organs or brains or anything inside that body

  


Future Clockman: it's silly really but we're both restrained in a way.

  


he appears behind phantom who holds him down with her telekinesis but he creates an astral projection of his kick as it shoots out like a projectile and hits phantom into the ground 

  


before large clockman creates a giant astral projection of a dragon that he launches like a projectile hitting phantom and creating a large explosion!

  


soon enough phantom finds herself without her tentacles and she raises up

  


future clockman: your forces abandoned you alone. The Fight is clearly over, I suggest you leave the premise this instant, and I won't have to hunt you down.

  


phantom toilet: (slowly smirks) oh I'm not done yet.

  


(menacing glare)

  


Suddenly a portal appears just behind Future Clockman and phantom arms grab on to him

  


Future Clockman: (tries to break free… “but it's no use”)

  


(they take him away before it closes!)

  


(song ends)

  


phantom laughs to herself looking at Ketzy

  


phantom: that was annoying, let's finish what started shall we.

  
  


she begins trying to siphon Ketzy glitching out the time stop again as she screams in pain struggling to keep herself kneeling

  


the time stop stops and phantom while fully siphoning Ketzy: it's time to finally see you my old friend

  


She charges up an explosion then releases it which starts with a laser firing out of the roof and then exploding…  
  


  


**Destroying the clock tower as the screen cuts to black.we hear the sounds of an ominous clock as phantom speaks waiting for** **HIS, Arrival**  
  


(or that's what she thought)

  
  
  
  
  
  


**suddenly a barrier blocks the attacks..despite being inside the room even that doesn't work! and phantom looks in frustration as he stops trying to control Ketzy putting all her power to try and hit the tower but no effect is done**

  


phantom: the barrier is back this fast? It's quite somehow, what does this mea

  


(she looks to see a pencil wall disintegrating as it reveals **Ketzy and all the rest of the elite agents being unscathed**)   




Ketzy: it means you lost! and I recommend you to leave this instant!

  


(as she speaks, the clouds in the sky of what was through to be eternal darkness actually spread out (because of phantoms nuclear level blast) letting the light for the first time in a while)

  


she said cracks all over her entire body parts of her armour falling off from the damage to her body…

  


clock woman still in the ground: Ketzy wait!..

  


phantom: you dare speak to me like that mortal? at any moment I can MAKE you my SERVANT if I wanted too. 

  


Ketzy: What use do you you have for an almost deaad soldier? it's not like i have much time anywaaays. leave the premise and ALL friends won't be able to hunt you down.

  


Phantom, despite her injuries almost does the closest thing she can to a smile turning her back on Ketzy and floating to the huge hole on the tower she made earlier looking at her she speaks: alright..but know this…



  
(she gives Ketzy one talk through a mind mess)  
  


***None of you, not even me, are supposed to even be here. BUT LIVE HAPPY with your fake memories that this world has given you***



  
Ketzy looks at her silently..dead in the eyes without a single shown of fear towards her words and phantom responds by flying away at fast speeds annoyed by her enemy

  


and suddenly..Ketzy collapses to the ground!clockwoman: KETZY!!!

  


assassin drillman and Drillwoman despite their injuries get up and rush towards Ketzy! so does Clockwoman as she holds Ketzy in her arms whos right now slowly cracking..parts of her body are slowly melting and turning into ink

  


Ketzy: It's okay, Clockwoman…I know we were supposed to be doing this equally but I'm sorry..I care too much about you all. I wouldn't have changed a thing on what i did earlier…

  


clockwoman: please! Ketzy! you'll be alright!

  


Ketzy: hey, Listen to me, I know the skibidis ain't all sunshine and rainbows..but.,. but maybe the Cassette men aren't as crazy as some of u..us say they are..please…that human there…he needs our help

  


clockwoman: of course! but please! Let me try to heal you!

  


Ketzy: Clockwoman…you already said it earlier it.. it's not possible!...i….**sob**, (holds Clockwoman on the shoulder)

  


Ketzy: Just, keep an eye on him for me will ya.

  


(Ketzy glances at an unconscious kevin)



Clockwoman: I'm not sure what you see in him or why but sure,. I.,. I will.



(the clouds of darkness once again return to once they were blocking the sun for who knows how long now)

  


Suddenly… Ketzy melts into a bunch of ink or atleast her body does with her pen head falling to the floor all that ink is now on Clockwomans hands as she shakes…filipino TV man and samurai cameraman go into the room..silent as they look at the scene same for knifeman and plunger who entered holding onto sticks just to walk due to their damages

  
  


tho plungerman was a little less silent as he saw the scene: Ketzy… no

  


Plungerman: We gotta do something about this  
  


knifeman: no we cannot

  


Plungerman: what do you mean we canno





knifeman: look at her plunger, whatever she did she saved all of us. it's clear her sacrifice wasn't in vain.

  


Plunger: (is now silent)  
  


knifeman holds plungermans shoulder: look Im as sad as you are… but i've seen you survive through your sheer will im sure… maybe, just maybe… there is a chance she makes it out of this

  


Suddenly someone enters the room!

rushing past everyone who's silent he goes towards her daughter: KETZY! WHERE ARE YOU?

  


plungerman, knifeman and the other elites look at him silently..

  


chief pencilman: is everything alright? YOU ACCOMPANIED MY DAUGHTER YEAH? SHE IS OKAY RIGHT?

  


knifeman and plunger:......

  


Assassin Drillman and Drillwoman:......

  


Samurai cam and Filipino Tv man:......



  
Clockwoman:......

  


the chief pencilman sees the pen in the ground…what remains of Ketzy!

  


chief pencilman:....

  


he holds it in his hands treating it gently as he begins to cry and sob

  


silence filled the room completely

  


clockwoman: her.. body is too damaged from time radiation or well…the side effects of going to your limits with time powers..we can't bring her back not even chief can heal things affected by it

  


chief pencilman stays silent…and someone's head pokes through the hole that phantom left earlier as he shows himself

  


Chief pencilman does some wave signals: c-pen…

  


c-pen: yes father?.....affirmative

  


***calling all troops! leave the premise and come back to headquarters***

  


the pencilmen proceed to teleport away with the portals created by the pencil copters and tanks as they each all say goodbye to their comrades

  


the elites get out of the building the chief pencilman holding what was left of her daughter on his hand as c-pen turns around to the rest and speaks to them

  


c-pen: I and chief apologize for this sudden withdrawal…we won't be returning for a while we hope the rest of you can understand

  


clockwoman: chief..i want you to know she still has time left! I'm not sure how long it will take,but there is a chance!



  
Clockwoman: she's a hero, you know that. 

  


Chief pencilman nods before they both go away in a portal that takes them to the pencil base as it goes away and they disappear…

  


**the pencilmen won't be returning for a long while**

  
  
  
  
  


kevin his visor entirely broken as he slowly gets up…the pain is awful!: OOOUGH….i don't know how i'm still alive i felt like a whole interdimensional battle just happened right next to me!..

  


police skibidiman: just be glad we are alive my homie…

  


kevin: Please come up with another name..

  


police skibidman: kevin 11?

  


kevin: AAAGH STOP

  


police skibidiman: hehehehe anyhow..

  


ninja skibidiman: it, it seems quiet, a little too quiet, almost as if the battle is..

  


???: over

  


they all turn around immediately getting up and seeing who it was!

  


it was Clockwoman surrounded by other elites as she spoke: the shield returned and your forces…they retreated a long time ago

  


police skibidiman: sarge is there anything we can do?..



  
Kevin: get it ready (nods to Police)

  


kevin: What are you going to do now? it's not like we can escape. Go ahead and finish us once and for all... 

  


Clock Woman: leave while you still can

  


kevin’s squad & basically everyone else in the tower WHAAAAAT???!!!!

  


the alliance team: what do you mean, haven’t you seen what they…

  


clockwoman: it's what Ketzy would have wanted…

  


kevin: (Is shocked to hear that and then realises she is no longer here)

  


ninja skibidiman: i've heard of cassettes sparing toilets but…this is a first for me

  


Assassin drillman: are you seriously gonna let our enemies go? these idiots are the reason we’re here

  


drillwoman: please…i'm sure Ketzy would be glad we're doing this

  


assassin drillman: but it's their fault that she's even in her position in the first place tho! And look at what he and the rest of those bastards did to this city.

  


clockwoman: apparently you're humans, even when you're against us, it's our duty to protect you all.

  


police skibidiman: well I'm actually a sk-

  


ninja skibidiman: ¡shhh! Keep quiet if you want to live!



  
kevin: I appreciate your kindness but ¨all of you¨? you can choke on those words.

  


clockwoman: look, Ketzy sees something good in you in particular. I couldn't really hear that conversation you had, but If she believes your a good person, then so do I.

  


kevin: fine..but, just know we'll meet again…oh yeah one more thing!

  


Clockwoman: yeah?

  


Kevin: no more hard feelings between most of you…i won't personally hate you even if we will still be enemies but…

  


he stares at assassin drillman memories…playing in his head as he remembers the screams and the fire that surrounded the area.. alongside phantom sounds…

  


kevin: I can only forgive so many.

  


HE THROWS HIS LAST CAPSULE AT INSANE SPEEDS ON ASSASSIN DRILLMAN AND IT HITS HIM DEAD ON! DESTROYING HIS LEGS AS HE FALLS TO THE GROUND ELECTRICITY SPREADING ON HIS BODY AS HE SCREAMS IN PAIN!

  


Drillwoman: OLLIE!

  


Kevin: go go go!

  


ninja skibidiman immediately pulls out a tv cube that they stole from the alliance and teleports away with his friends not only that but the capsule had some special effects that resisted against time powers as clock woman tried only for her head to burst out some smoke tho not too much and she sees as assassin drillman keeps his injuries

  


Kevin's squad successfully escaped as plunger,daggers,Filipino TVman and samurai cameraman tried to get them but it was too late!

  


Plungerman:GOD DANGIT! THEY GOT AWAY..



  
clockwoman: (tries to use her powers but it also doesn't work) Assassin! we gotta get you some help!!

  


“there's no way.?.?.?.?.?.?”

  


Assassin drillman: im- **COUGH COUGH** fine..just get me to a alliance hospital quickly

  


(Clockwoman stares into the abyss realising)

  
  
  


**this is all just the beginning**

Proud of his work so far! genuinely smiling for the first time in a LOONG while..he gets a call to come over tho as he guesses his plan to blow up the clock tower failed! atleast Dr Kleiner's procedure is seemingly working…

  


He walks to a hallway to an elevator and on his way he sees several horror toilets that were being experimented on…

https://preview.redd.it/tswynj1es6fe1.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=b35a3a75e71b4cf48e5c07b4a339bfb2e0fc230e

Thankfully they are all filthy war criminals and other such so he doesnt care that much about their well being he enters the elevator and it goes down and down until he finally makes it to the bottom floor thinking about his destroyed mech: thats gonna complicate things so badly with her but whatever.

  


the elevator door opens: I hope the elites are doing well..

  


He enters a chamber and meets Alpha and Conrad watching as he enters.

  


Conrad: Let's continue this interrogation later on… We have the scientist waiting…



Scientist is a bit annoyed at her but he's gotta pretend like he doesn't hate her guts at the moment.

Alpha: You won't get tired of losing old man, will you?

  


Commander: Give him a break lady, he's trying his best.

  


Alpha: silence! it wasn't even my idea but he could've at least killed a titan or two! even randoms from “your other competitor” (toilet empire) could do such a thing after all.

  


Alpha: that's especially goes for that grotesque doctor and his so called horror toilets..or whatever he calls them

  


Conrad (commander): Miss Alpha, I'm gonna remind you that you are still relatively new to this alliance,you're going to need to earn our trust if you want any control over the army.

  


Alpha: The point is that I'm done with all these old tricks. Neither brute force or smart tactics were used will work on the alliance again when they are known to adapt just like us. please… I can earn your trust! Just let me have control over the next major battle and we will be unstoppable! **I already have a course of action against the clocks… and the drills. Just give me a chance**!

  


Conrad: fine but I'm gonna have to consult the Commander about this so don't expect to command the next few battles.

  


Alpha: ho i don't mind,as long as its worthwhile my time.

  


Conrad: understood.

  


Alpha uses her orb and it shows a beak-like face with horns.

Alpha: Once I find the “missing link"" I've been looking for on this planet… Master…Will Rule!

  


**END OF CHAPTER 39**

  


well..that was a nice narration, it's really sad, but there was nothing else I could have done. But..I GOTTA GET FUTURE CLOCKMAN OUT OF THERE! but that space…it's not like the void, it's something completely different..something hard for me to access! hmmm i still need to send someone else other than me.

***END OF SKIBIDI INFINITY XXXIX***"
I don't want to put my dog down,Pets,1i9tyb9,2025-01-25 13:51:01,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1i9tyb9/i_dont_want_to_put_my_dog_down/,Icy-Job-780,DOG,"Let me start this by saying that this is a very long vent, I know what I have to do but I'm just struggling with it. 

I have an 8 y/o dachshund, Toby, he was a foster from a very abusive home that my mom originally took in to help cope with the loss of our family dog, a very gentle chocolate lab. My mom could not stand to give him up and adopted him because she felt bad for what his previous owners had done to him and wanted to give him a loving home. 

From the start he was a very anxious dog, very reactive, and would snap at anyone getting close to his bum or bring your face close to him. Really didn't like men and would bark and hide from me whenever I would visit. She had another dog too, similar age mastiff mix who is a classic all American family dog, 100lbs of absolutely zero aggression. Over time Toby seemed to soften up, he would come around on his own asking for cuddles and whatnot, but he always has those indistinct boundaries that he would enforce. Sometimes the back was fine, sometimes no. My mom would do as much as she felt she could get away with that he was comfortable with, especially when he'd jump up on her lap and nudge her hand or roll over in her lap, seeming to enjoy his rubs. Then inevitably he would randomly snap at her. She never did any classes with him, only hopes that he would settle over time.

When he snaps, it's completely out of nowhere, without warning. He snapped at hands a few times breaking skin, this was brushed off by my mom saying it was her fault she must've violated his boundaries. Then he snapped at her face, breaking skin in her nose and bruising her when she kissed his forehead. This was something she had worked up to with him over months and that she had also been doing for months. He would come up to her and stand tall tipping his nose down to present her his forehead when he wanted a kiss. Again, my mom brushed it off that she crowded his space and it was her fault. It seemed he wanted to be loved on and would try to be chill but he'd just get overwhelmed all of a sudden and didn't know how to react so he'd snap.This was probably about 3 years after she got him. 

He bit my sister shortly after when she sat on the couch next to him accidentally on his tail, breaking skin and leaving a bruise. 

After that they basically took a big step back from him as the biting was getting harder and seemingly more random. Safer just to leave him be, my mom and sister were scared to get really close to him. Another few years goes by, he is having all kind of behavioral problems now because no one wants to pet him much anymore, he's doing attention seeking behavior like messing the house at night, which he never did before. Brought to the vet multiple times and nothing was wrong physically, purely behavioral.

My mom retires, has to sell her house and get an apartment, kind of gives me an ultimatum that I need to take the dogs or else she will have to give them up due to her new living conditions. Sister couldn't take them as she's much younger and basically broke, I live with my partner and we both have good jobs and a house without pets. It sucked to be put in a bind like that but I was happy to add dogs to our household and this was an easy transition for everyone, especially since I knew my mom's dogs very well and particularly love the big guy, Otis. At first I didn't want to take Toby because of his history, but my mom and sister made arguments that they were basically bonded now having spent 5+ years together already and would both be very depressed without each other. Regretfully we agreed to take both.

We had some growing pains with Toby at first, messing in our house now and acting weird, understand given new house and strangers (my partner, guests, etc), city life, busy sidewalks, etc but he quickly adapted and seemed like a completely new dog. Even my mom and sister would comment how calm he was when they visited, we couldn't believe the change in him. Then one day he got into the trash and I was scolding him, it was like a switch flipped and he lunged at me and bit my thigh. Luckily I was wearing pants but I had a bruise bigger than a hockey puck for weeks and still have a scar.

I started putting distance with him the same way my mom did, my partner did as well but he's her baby so she still gave him plenty of attention.

A year passes, no incident. I go to my friends cottage and bring the dogs. Give everyone a very clear warning that he is unpredictable, he will try to cuddle you or jump on your lap but just leave him alone. We are all sitting by a fire, I go inside for another beer and hear a scream outside. Turns out one of the guy's girlfriend thought I was exaggerating and brought Toby up on her lap while I was gone because he was so cute, she kissed his ear and he turned around and bit her temple. Nearly got her eye, she could've been blinded. Tons of blood, had to go to the hospital, gets stitches and antibiotics. I felt terrible because that was the first bite outside the family, I was pissed the girl had done despite my warning that but still ultimately recognized that it was my responsibility. My partner and I discussed his behavior when I got home and considered the risks of having him around, especially as we are planning to start a family one day and we both know we would never trust him in the same room as a child. We ultimately were not ready to put him down, especially when the girl who got bit knew we were considering it and wrote us a long text that she felt so bad that she had done that and basically begged us not to put him down because of her mistake. 

Fast forward another year, he snaps at the air within a few inches of my partners face while she is adjusting a blanket on the couch that is under him. This is the most aggression he has shown her in the entire time he's been with us. Seems he had the wherewithal to hold back actually hurting her. This puts her on edge but she quickly forgives him.

Now this week, I am laying in bed with Toby and Otis, Toby is crate trained but sleeps in bed with me during the day while I'm sleeping for night shift and my partner is gone to work. Toby comes to be the little spoon, as he's done a million times with me. Then he shifts around and tries to sleep directly on the pillow next to me with his bum in my face, too close for my comfort given that is a no-zone for him. I tell him to move, he lazily just rolls over a bit and I tell him again then give him a gentle pat on the back/shoulders, usually a universally safe place to touch since the beginning, and in the blink of an eye he turns on and bites down hard on my hand, fully piercing the ball of my thumb. I don't even react to him, I see blood start pouring immediately and run to the bathroom to flush the wound. He slyly goes to his crate knowing he just fucked up bad, I could see the regret on his face. 

I go to the hospital, have to get stitches, within 12 hours it is already severely infected and I now require daily IV antibiotics at the hospital on top of oral antibiotics. My hand is nearly the size of a tennis ball, I have infection tracking down my arm.. 

I can't imagine if this were to happen to anyone else, especially my partner. Or my friend who dog sits for us. It has to stop, it's going to keep happening.

I talk to my partner and I say I think it's time. She agrees but is still having a hard time accepting it. We would all just like to pretend this didn't happen because he's been so good.. but I know we can't risk this. 

I feel like despite how obvious it is that he is unpredictable and dangerous, I still love the little guy, he has such a funny personality and my partner never had dogs growing up so she is quite attached to the little guy. I feel like the bad guy, I can't shake the feeling that I'm basically the one deciding he's going to die now. We don't want to give him away because we know they'll likely put him down anyways and his last moments will be with strangers who don't know him, he would hate that. 

There isn't a vet in town that will touch him until our health unit's 10 day rabies protocol is observed, which makes it worse cause now I'm off work and at home with the little guy all day and he's just his usual self. So now we have to wait and every day that passes by our resolve is weakening to carry through with it. It sucks, in 10 days time I'm scared I won't have the heart to bring him in anymore. I know I have to, or at least I think that is the most responsible thing to do, but I just look at him sleeping on the couch as I type this and can't imagine our home without him. I know Otis will be super depressed, they are such a pair. Best friends. I know if I told my partner that we should keep him that she would be the happiest person. It all feels like it's resting on me."
"Jonah 4:11, Babylon, A Colony of the Unexpected, Many Perilous Men, + A Time Check",Bibleconspiracy,1i9tv8c,2025-01-25 13:47:13,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bibleconspiracy/comments/1i9tv8c/jonah_411_babylon_a_colony_of_the_unexpected_many/,GirlAnon323,Prophecy Watch,"

I know I said I probably wouldn't post here anymore, but I had a feeling to share this message.



I would like to discuss several things in this post. 

I have been thinking about the connection between Babylon and the Catholic church for some time. I was doing some research and there are interesting connections to California that made me think California is the epicenter of modern Babylon.

News about the proposed secession of California confirms what I have been thinking AND helps me have more insight about a vision I received two or three years before and something that happened yesterday. 

This is going to seem weird and gross, but I think it's relevant to the times because it speaks something from Jonah and Jonah is a major spiritual and prophetic messenger for this generation of human beings living on earth. 


I have been homeless for about three years, I think, with some time I was at shelters and a rooming house, but have been living in a tent for a year.

It's difficult to bathe because I am watched and I don't have regular water at my camp. I have to bring water here. There's rarely enough for bathing because I have to have enough for drinking and cooking. 

I haven't been to a hotel in a year and I don't feel safe showering at the homeless services place because of the persecution and crimes that have been committed against me. 

That being said, I try to get clean clothes and manage personal hygiene the best I can with what I have available. It being winter and getting banned from helping subreddits because I have been accused of scamming has made things more difficult. The accusation isn't true. 

I have had one pair of socks for some time. I noticed something last week and was wondering what I was being conscious of. There was something that I couldn't quite figure out. Then a couple days ago, I returned from begging, and checked the bandage on my foot from needing support for my ankle and discovered my feet were in bad shape. 

There was a colony of fungus growing on them. When I knew this, I figured out the thing I was being conscious of. 

Yesterday, I treated my feet with a cure. The cure is so powerful that it eliminates all of whatever harmful things were growing on my feet. 

It was traumatic though. Traumatic for my feet to be in that condition and to be struggling for basic human rights like housing and water and food, but traumatic, too,  because I was conscious of and feeling the reality that the harmful things I was removing were living organisms. 

When I was doing the cure, I was conscious the living organisms dying from the shock of the cure. It was a disturbing experience. 

What might God wish for me to know from that? What fruit might God wish to produce from having me witness to the fact that there was life in the harmful organisms growing on my feet? 

I don't think it's that He wishes for me to let harmful things overtake the health of my skin and feet, but I do think He is saying something from Jonah. Specifically Jonah 4:11.

Jonah 4:11

New King James Version

11 And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?”

I hope I will do a good job with this message so people are able to understand. 

I was traumatized because I witnessed that tiny harmful organisms growing on my feet have life that God created. 

Sometimes I think when we talk about the revelation for Babylon, we can be cavalier about the destruction prophesied in the book of Revelation. 

Many of us believe or have believed that Babylon in the book of Revelation is America. I have thought that Babylon is the Catholic church, the scarlet beast is Native Americans, and America is the wilderness where Babylon and the scarlet beast were seen by the John that authored the book of Revelation. 

What I learned about the Catholic church's connection to California and remembering the vision I received, makes me think that the destruction isn't for all of America, but will be the west coast with California being the epicenter. 

In the vision I received, I saw America split. There was a great chasm between the east coast and the west coast and I think this is more than symbolism or a great cataclysm. There were other events that I saw that are happening, so I view the vision as trustworthy. 

What we will see, is if the interpretation is accurate with regard to the split that I saw. 

You may be asking, well what does this have to do with being traumatized by foot organisms and Jonah. 

First, the Good Good news is that Christ died so that we can be free and those that believe and are born again, look forward to salvation and unending life with Him.

Then, people like to say that ""the devil's in the details"" and that saying has meanings that are relevant to modern society. Yet, our God is the architect of Life and He has given attention to the tiniest particularities of this world, even letting organisms that can't be seen with the human eye, have a form of ""life"" that can be perceived and witnessed. 

How much more does He care about humanity and His creatures that are able to love and have personalities? 

Jonah, like many of the prophets, was angry. But, Jonah was angry about the wrong things. He wasn't angry about the unrighteousness that was happening in Ninevah, He was angry about the vocation he was called to, what he thought was the futility of his task, and his comfort. 

The organisms that were growing on my feet are like Jonah's plant. It was traumatic to feel the life of those organisms passing, but should I have had pity for something that would have harmed me if I had done nothing to cure the problem? 

There were 120,000 people in Ninevah. There are about 346 million people in America. I don't think America is Babylon. 

We know that there will be vast devastations, famines, and plagues. We know that the word of God is true and He's not a man that He should lie about the things that He has told us before hand about happening. 

The other good news is He loves people and He cares about our lives more than the organisms that try to form symbiotic colonies on our feet and the ""plants"" that He, too, created with care and attention. 

There are many people wishing to leave America, myself among those, but my reasons are more political. 

I think the Babylon that believers are called to leave, are the churches that have forgotten God and chosen tradition instead of truth. 


Revelation 18:4

And I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.

What are her plagues? I think this is more than the diseases that are released from the bowls of wrath.


I think the plagues Revelation 18:4 references are detailed in 2 Timothy 3:1-7 and James 5:1-6.


2 Timothy 3:1-7

New King James Version

Perilous Times and Perilous Men

3 But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! 6 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth



James 5:1-6


Rich Oppressors Will Be Judged

5 Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you! 2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. 3 Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. 4 Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. 5 You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you.

Perilous men and rich oppressors holding back the wages of mowers and ignoring the cries of the reapers. 

Verse six of James 5 references the death of Christ and Mark 12:17.


Mark 12:17

New King James Version

17 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”

Verse six references too, in a prophetic sense, the church's denial of Christ, in this age, by subverting His truth to favor man made traditions and the government commodification of Christianity that we see with Christian nationalism. 

The final things I wish to discuss in this post are preterism and Revelation 20 because it's connected to the book of James. 

People keep posting theories that are about a ""little"" season of Satan, but Revelation 20:3 contradicts that theory. 

Revelation 20:3

New King James Version

3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.


This can't be a ""little"" season of satan because satan still deceives the nations and there has never been a time in human history, yet, when he hasn't. The theory claiming that Christ has already returned is not true because it contradicts Scripture. 

There is evidence that this is a deception. America has space force, Musk has creation a vast artificial neural network with space technology, and the James web telescope, I believe, was created and funded by the ultra wealthy men and women that work in the shadows to try to control and influence all of society. The purpose is to attempt to see the savior approaching to try stop him and wage a human revolutionary war against God. 

But what does God say about His arrival?

Matthew 24:29-31

New King James Version

The Coming of the Son of Man

29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.


Matthew 24:36-42


No One Knows the Day or Hour

36 “But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. 37 But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. 42 Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. 

1 Corinthians 15:52

New King James Version

52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.


Matthew 11:12 references the perilous men and rich oppressors that have waged war against God and His kingdom. 


Matthew 11:12

New King James Version

12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.

If the perilous men and rich oppressors in this age repented like the people of Ninevah, we might think they aren't planning to wage war against God when He returns. 

That we know the character of such men, that cooperate with Satan, we know too, that Satan is still working to try deceive humanity and the nations.


I think the time is 4th Seal, 6th Trumpet, 2nd Bowl. "

VCX-100 vs. YT-2400; Which is the better for a would be Spacer,StarWars,1i9tqdy,2025-01-25 13:41:20,0,0.4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1i9tqdy/vcx100_vs_yt2400_which_is_the_better_for_a_would/,Dull_Law_9953,General Discussion,"So you want to make your life on the hyper space lanes, Whatever side of the law you plan to place your career you've got you're proper piloting and freight hauling licenses, and even decided to over achieve and get a bounty hunting license to open more opportunities, (and perhaps get some more leeway in what ""equipment"" you carry). All that's left is to get yourself a ship. You've narrowed it down to two, both from CEC, The VCX-100 and the YT-2400.

The benefits both share:

1. Both ships should be simple enough to maintain and find repair shops to handle any non secretive repairs that are needed.\* 

2. Both are quite easily modifiable to the task at hand and the taste of the pilot.\*

3. Because they are common no one will bat to much of an eye if one lands at port (beyond the eye any CEC light freighter would get) so if you want to do a job quietly it's doable.\*

4. Both ships can theoretically be operated solo, or can have droids cover for living crew.

5. Both are capable of holding a personal speeder bike or smaller speeder for any travelling you want to do planet side.

6. Both are fully capable of being great ships for space combat.

7. Both theoretically can install lighter ion cannons for disabling ships if you need to catch someone while in space.

\*With great thanks to the CEC!

Benefits of the VCX-100

1. Greater volume of storage, (though I don't think we have a canonical weight capacity as of yet).

2. Centerline cockpit

3. Weapons align with the cockpit making aiming easier.

4. Greater amenities on board due to greater volume.

5. Spare shuttle craft that can double as a fighter if necessary.

Particular weakness of the VCX-100

1. While a solo pilot can operate it it, it does not seem as easy to do so as a YT-2400

Benefits of the YT-2400

1. Easier to Operate solo from what we've seen

2. Smaller size opens up more possible landing areas when you are operating outside of ports

3. Part of the older YT series meanings there's probably more parts and maintenance knowledge for it.

4. Can carry 2 months worth of consumables vs the VCX-100s 1 month.

5. Escape Pod is not far from the cockpit

Particular weakness of the YT-2400

1. While having that 150 metric ton cargo capacity, said cargo hold for it has much less volume, leaving less room for any holding cells for bounties, and it'll be a tight fit for your speeder bike

With all that in mind, if you were going to wander the Star Wars galaxy in one of these two ships based on the considerations above and also listed here: **(ability to operate solo, capable of freight and/or bounty hunting jobs as necessary, relative ease of maintenance and modification, access to parts and ports of call for the same, and a ship that won't attract too much attention)**, which would it be?

If you think their is a third ship that meets that criteria what is it? (perhaps you think the YT-2000 manages to marry the best parts of the two even if it's an older model and had a more limited run) feel free to mention it, (while also answering which of the original 2 would be preferred). 

If you want to elaborate on a choice for such a ship for an era from before these ships were made and thus not an option (both were seemingly built after the empire formed but before the rebellion was in full swing) feel free to include that as well.

Feeling like dying during meditation?,Meditation,1i9ti16,2025-01-25 13:31:08,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1i9ti16/feeling_like_dying_during_meditation/,Current_Gas_5403,Question ❓,"Hey guys. I've tried to read up a lot of information to this experience but I don't have the feeling I can find a similar description for it anywhere so here I am. 

Short backstory to me:
I have been meditating for around 9 years now, so quite some time now. 
I've done focused attention meditation, body scans, open awareness and also practice a lot of mindfulness. 
I've had a lot of interesting and intense experiences and enjoyed most of them. But over the past few months I've had a few reoccuring experiences which were really terrifying. 

It almost always happens in relation to sleep. 
It is a feeling where I feel a crazy (like really crazy) tingle in my head and spine and my mind goes numb. It feels like im getting pulled into the abyss and I am literally dying. 
Since I am terribly afraid of death this feeling scares the shit out of me. But the even more scary thing is: I lose control over my body. I can't move and I have to fight with all my power left in my mind to not get sucked into the abyss and wake up and be able to move again. It feels like my lights of my brain are being shut off. 

The thing is, I have a lot of experience with catching myself in the inbetween state of falling asleep and being awake and that is totally different. And most of the time there i just glide into sleep without noticing. 

And there is also another big difference and that might sound crazy but here it is:

As far as I know now this mostly (if not only) happens, when I am dreaming inside of a dream. 
So basically my normal dream is my reality (for that dream yk) and there I fall asleep. And during this falling asleep I experience this type of feeling. 
Not too long ago I had the most terrifying experiences of them all:
I was having this being sucked in sensation while in my dream i was in my bed besides my girlfriend. And while trying to fight being sucked down, i tried to move and kick my girlfriend with my elbow so she can help my stay alive/awake basically. And I have managed to do so, but she was asleep and couldn't help me. 
But the thing is I then woke up (to real reality) and my girlfriend was still awake and said that I didn't move and try to kick her. That was so extremely scary that I almost didn't dare to fall asleep again because it was so damn terryfing. 

And the thing is, I've had some extremely blissful experiences with these ""second layer"" lucid dreams as well. Where I realised I was dreaming and started meditating. And then I was in total bliss and exstacy. It didn't last long until I woke up to the ""first layer"" dream and tried to fall asleep again. And that feels so different to that. 

So I am really puzzled as to what that might be. 
I hope this was understandable as this a very complicated matter to explain...

Ever don't feel appreciated by men your age? Well if you're seeking appreciation from an enthusiastic young man then you're right where you should be! 

Older women are so incredibly sexy to me that I find it hard to put ingo words. Whenever I fantasize about women it's always women that are way older than I am. I just can't emphasize enough how much age intruiges and attracts me. Many find what age does to a  women's body unappealing but for me it just makes jt more desirable and sexy. Whether a little chub or some sagging or wrinkles, I absolutely love it all. It just makes me wanna explore those ""imperfections"" even more. 

I'm also very intruiged by mature women's lufe situations. Many girls my age (I'm 24) are only just now starting to get careers and still figuring out what to do with themselves, which can be interesting but is no comparison to actual life experience. I'd love to know mkre abouz your situation and life circumstances. Are you a housewufe or career woman, outgoing or shy? 

How does this influence your fantasies and desires and what are some possible repressed urges? 

I'm basically looking for an enthusiastic and open minded mature woman to keep me company ;) If that sounds like you and you're eager for the attention of an enthusiastic young man then messge me! "

Which upcoming strategic/tactical RPGs have your attention?,StrategyRpg,1i9telx,2025-01-25 13:26:56,27,0.97,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrategyRpg/comments/1i9telx/which_upcoming_strategictactical_rpgs_have_your/,Rasputin5332,Indie SRPG,"Ever since Battle Brothers came out, I feel like the indie scene has become much fresher with tactics-based, sandboxy or semi sandbox games that that keep the genre alive. In fact, I dare say it’s the unexpected indie blasts that have done more to keep my interest — than basically any AAA release (in any genre). From the retro flashbacks the likes of [SKALD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1069160/SKALD_Against_the_Black_Priory/), which was an experience that perfectly aligned going into it straight out of Fear and Hunger. [Unicorn Overlord](https://unicornoverlord.atlus.com/index.html?lang=en) was another one that I liked a lot, although it irks me that it didn’t come out on PC (also, an exception to my flair as it's not an indie) so I’m forced to play it on my old PS4 (don’t know about you, but in general I prefer playing the genre on PC…) Oh, and of course there’s the full release of [Songs of Conquest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/867210/Songs_of_Conquest/) that also came out last year, though it’s admittedly more TBS than SRPG - but I think the vast magic system complements the role-playing and tactics well enough to be included.

In other words, las year was for me a blast for the genre, with tons of stuff to replay in between my usual bouts in ARPG and story-intense CRPGs (most recent bein Rogue Trader). But what does 2025 and beyond have in store? Curious to see if there’s any major, or even minor releases that people are excited for, just to see if I’m missing something. I think the upcoming [Happy Bastards](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2964560/Happy_Bastards/) game is looks pretty unique in how it’s gonna handle character and world building with you being an antihero of sorts who “uses” his mercenaries to push onward instead. Might make for interesting roleplaying, since that’s what I think the genre tends to lack when it comes to impactful decision making (storywise at least), or I just haven’t played enough games to know.

So, what’s caught your attention for the foreseeable future, if anything?"

What should I do,Advice,1i9tbxf,2025-01-25 13:23:47,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9tbxf/what_should_i_do/,precioxe,,"Honestly I didn't think i'll have to write something like this. I(F21) am breaking in half thinking if i should dump my bf(M25) even if he's the healthiest relationship ive had . Keep in mind that he works abroad(so for example he leaves for 1.5month to come back for a 1-4weeks)

We're together for 2+years and before starting the relationship we were seeing each other for half a year. At that time i didnt even knew if he likes me, because there were no hints, no touching for all this time so i also kept it cool, even if i did like him from begginin. So after he actually did the first move(not sure if he would if i wouldnt hint him) everything seemed great, he was saying that he doesnt talk to other girls, he dont have a lot of seriuos excperience from relationships, was taking care of me, i lived with him and his parents when he would come back. (Important note that me myself is very traumatised  and insecure, i never hid that for him but he said that theres no problem with that, he might not understand me, but will support me). Once in the beggining i said that i dont like compliments(because he would say things like ""youre KINDA pretty"" and it just didnt sound good or honest enough) and that he should give me space when im mentally struggling(because i didnt want to be a burden for him) but my mental did get a little better with him and he seemed healthy so i didnt pay a lot of attention that he gives me minimal effort on reassuring or validating me.

So some time into this ship and i find that he's following some ig slut(just nudes) from country he's working from, i told him that i dont feel good about it and he said ""oh come on, i have bigger problems""(he had an argument at work)), but after i asked him how he would feel if i masturbated on other dudes, he unfollowed and apologised. But thats when i started going down the spiral and being extra insecure, i visibly started having harder time and he didnt do anything about it( at this point i did tell him how i feel and that im not better alone).
Some time later we planned to go on a trip for couple of days and he invited a group of his friends(he knows that i dont feel comfortable about it) and he said if you dont want to you can stay home but was still convincing me to come because he will spend his day with me and on evenings he would meet them. I  hardly agreed and on a way there he called me a friend a couple of times(he also did this couple times before with family or friends) and he didnt see a problem with that ""because he saw friendship in us"" and also made another very fucking dumb excuse that i cant even translate properly.
I almost dumped him after all of these stories but he did treat me good so i just wanted to believe that he just couldnt express himself properly and i could trust him.
Couple months ago we moved to the country hes working in. Still dont get actuall reasurance or validation for me, just the things i do for him(basicly being a wife but he dont want to get married till 30). I see him trying but in other love languages, not what i say that i actually need, and when he actually tries(because im already mad) it becomes comfort which makes me even more mad.
But what actually happened that breaks me? I couldnt deal with my thoughts and i cheked his phone(could have done a long time ago because ""he wasnt hiding anything""). I found chats where he tells other girls how pretty, amazing and smart they are(not in a minimal effort way). I found there everything he couldnt get do to me. He was doing this before and during relationship. The worst thing, that these girls were obviously rejecting him and he still gave them attention and compliments.

The thing that confuses me the most is that he didnt do it for a while year. He says that he doesnt know why he did that and he feels disguisting himself, that his love is only growing stronger, he didnt love me that deep then and and now everything he does is just for me or us. I did often see how he's taking care of me and how bad he feels when he cant make me feel validated. When we were breaking up i honestly believed him saying all these things, not from what he's saying but how. He havent cried in years before me and when he's breaking i can feel its real( cried couple times before for me in a span of couple months because his sad comforting isnt validating me enough(not in a toxic way))

My questions is it true that a mans feelings can grow from everyday life, should i trust his feelings when he has these patterns of emotionaly cheating me in the start? What should i do?"

But it’s not all about giving back - $PLATH has fun, too. Their Telegram and Reddit bots (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?) and upcoming NFTs add a layer of engagement for the community. Combine that with a strong team of diamond-handed whales, constant token burns, top-holder airdrops, and this project has serious long-term potential.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.1M
* **Strengths:** Charitable initiatives, original art, strong community engagement.
* **Targets:** Potential for a 2x-3x short-term, with significant long-term promise.

# $CATBAT (SOL) – The Crypto Space Protector

$CATBAT is not just a token; it’s a mission-driven initiative to clean up the crypto space. From developing ScamScout, a tool to help users avoid scams, to offering a unique rugged coin redemption platform, they’re tackling real issues head-on.

Daily token burns, top-holder airdrops, and partnerships with other major projects add to its appeal. Plus, the dev has locked his token supply for a year, building trust and ensuring stability for the community.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.7M
* **Strengths:** Anti-scam tools, daily burns, strong roadmap.
* **Targets:** ATH at 4M, with fast growth as tools roll out.

# $PYRATE (SOL) – Charting New Waters in Crypto

$PYRATE isn’t just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. From a rich storyline featuring characters and comics to a pfp builder web app and ocean-cleaning charity initiatives, this project is all about innovation and engagement.

With over 170K users of its Telegram bot, CEX listings on the way, and paid promotions kicking off soon, $PYRATE is positioning itself for explosive growth. Plus, their focus on community gaming (Minecraft and more) is a fun way to strengthen their loyal crew.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 790K
* **Strengths:** Expanding ecosystem, charity initiatives, engaged community.
* **Targets:** Near-term 1.5M, with potential for previous ATHs (3M) and beyond.

Just got an offer to do a semester abroad (exchange).

We had to put in our 5 top destinations, and I just got the message 2 days ago that I have been accepted to my no1 destination. The thing is, this was not my own first choice, it was my moms. She believed that this would be one that my dad would agree with, but she just likes it the most. The rest of the list was basically the same. i hate myself for it, because apparently my dad does not care where i go, he doesn't want me to go at all, so im so mad at myself for not just putting my dream universities on there, but at the same time, my mom was subtly shaming me so i wouldn't want to go there anymore, bc she does not understand why i would want to go there (japan).

The day I got the results I immediately messaged my mom, with a picture of the result and asking her if she was home. She just responded that she wasn't, that's it. I thought she just didn't notice the picture. When she was back home I immediately went to her to show her the picture again, nervous and excited for her reaction (I went to school that day, she had already been home from work for an hour at least, so i was not bothering her right after she came home from work). But she just looked at me and said ‘yeah i saw, you already sent me the picture’. I was a bit confused and asked her why she didn't respond, and she just said ‘what should i respond to that?’. I was really confused.

Then she managed to tell me something happened at work. It was not even that bad, just something with one of her colleagues, not even a clash, just something she was unhappy about. Also, my dad just had a pretty invasive surgery last year and has been at home for a while, and will be for a few more months. He is fine and can do basically everything, he just needs to rest properly and is taking pretty strong meds for the recovery. This day he was in a pretty foul mood. All this combined, I could understand her reaction, kinda. Still, she hasn't said anything about it the last 2 days, and I have to accept my spot in a few days.

I've just been feeling so unhappy about everything since then. I was so happy to tell her I got in, even though there is no guarantee I will be able to go. And she basically just ignored me, while she was the one that encouraged me to apply in the first place. I did not want to tell anyone before her, but I should've, maybe it would’n have hurt as much then. I understand that both of my parents are having a hard time but still, I'm their daughter you know, ig I expected a bit more, like I always try to do for them. 

I talked with one of my friends about everything and how disappointed and sad I was feeling that night on a walk, and she seemed very understanding and supportive. But when I saw her the next day on campus, she asked me if we could book the vacation that we were trying to book last week(first time she is asking me something like this herself at all), right now. I just stared at her. Everything I told her the day before didn't happen?? Then i just said i cant right now, not the time you know. (like you think i can ask my parents rn??)

I'm just having this dilemma right now and don't know what to do at all. I know I might be overreacting, but this is just how I'm feeling.

**So please someone tell me, what should i do?**

**Go on the exchange**, basically spend a shit ton of money (that i could be saving to use in my early 20s), being all on my own in a new country with no guarantee that i'll be able to befriend people in such a short time i'll be able to rely on them, while leaving the few personal connections i have back home behind, knowing that they probably won't even try to come visit me, with the possibility that they won't even know or contact me when i get back? And at the same time i will have probably messed up the bond i have with my dad?? and having to give all my energy, all my blood, sweat and tears just to convince him, or to basically go against him while giving everyone at home(siblings) who already are having a hard time an even more horrible time?? Just for me to be able to escape this hell hole household and environment(won't get into this, just keep it in mind) for 5 months?? To finally get the feeling all my effort in school, which apparently is the only personality trait I have(according to my relatives), is paying off? that i'm working towards something i enjoy(not just my future office job), that i'm getting my deserved vacation, finally getting some rest, finally something i’m doing for myself, where i can enjoy myself, even if it wasn't my first choice destination??

Or, should I **cancel the exchange**, just do a minor or something at my home university (which is interesting enough) while most of my uni friends are on their exchange (will make me really jealous i know but whatever)? Just to keep living in this depressive cycle with 2 parents that should've split years ago, daily fighting while i just keep quiet to not make it worse, spend most of my free days in the library instead of going out or whatever to make it seem like i have some kind of social live (just going out of the house)? Me always having to take initiative when I do want/have the time to go out (has been going on for 4 years so I'm done at this point). Try to be nice to family members  that I try so hard to fit in with, being so nice to, especially my younger cousins so they do not have to go through the shit my aunts and uncles put me through, just to be ignored by them? Living in a neighborhood where my highschool time just keeps coming back to me, where my old classmates 9 out 10 times try their hardest to ignore me? And lastly, stay here with my unreliable friends that never seriously ask how I am doing, me always having to message them first, not having time for me for weeks, me having to feel bad for them when they are having a hard time, but not getting back anything? Trying for years to just go on a short vacation, even just a weekend, with any of my friends, but always hearing ‘let's go another time, maybe next year?’ or whatever, but seeing them go all over the world with others, never asking me to join them, or just asking me anything in general? Being so fucking lonely honestly. So I'm just doing my best for nothing. Always having to listen attentively to everyone's stories at home about the horrible people at their workplace or about each other, with  them not having time to listen to me at all, only knowing about my grades and nothing else that has been going on in my life? Having tons of sleepless nights and not being able to get out of bed in the morning just to avoid them ig? (it has been getting worse the last few months)

I can go on like this, but I just really need an elaborate answer. **Please.**"
"Advice for ""Real Symptom"" OCD?",OCD,1i9t8s8,2025-01-25 13:20:00,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1i9t8s8/advice_for_real_symptom_ocd/,DepartureAcrobatic15,I need support - advice welcome,"Idk how else to title this. I have (diagnosed) chronic untreated OCD that began when I was 5 and I'm 27 years old now. A few months ago I started treatment for the first time. My psychiatrist recommended that I read Abromowitz's book ""Getting Over OCD"" which I finished last night after completing all the worksheets. The author advises OCD sufferers to ""lean into"" their symptoms/questions/thoughts to make their experience and inner narratives basically as awful as possible and then resist their compulsions/rituals (anything that is an anxiety reducing strategy). 

My current theme is a fear of developing mental voices or feelings that aren't my own (like in DID, OSDD, psychosis...). It turns out I've actually been experiencing light dissociation as an automatic coping mechanism due to the long term stress of the OCD in the form of feeling detached from my own strong emotions (especially positive ones, since OCD makes me feel unsafe to embrace joy), my brain ""blanking"" when trying to ruminate or think about my OCD (an involuntary forceful ""shutdown"" to protect myself from spiraling into panic) and also occasionally feeling like my thoughts or mind is drifting away from me (like depersonalization, but instead of observing myself from the outside, it's like I'm on the inside and my thoughts are outside of me? it's hard to explain and subtle). 

Basically, I do have some symptoms of dissociation from stress and overload and I keep getting the feeling that if I lean into my symptoms I might actually have the ability to make my worst fears come true and cause myself to become significantly more detached from my feelings, develop identity fragmentation or have involuntary voices. Part of my fear stems from my last theme where my eyes kept shaking and I was so scared I was doing it to myself. I spent over 2 years obsessing and trying to figure out what was wrong with me and convince myself it's ""just OCD"" and trying to control it. It turns out I have functional tics from FND and attention and stress makes it worse. But the fact is, it was a real thing. My OCD was surrounding ""real symptoms"" and not something I was making up in my head. This causes me to worry that maybe what I'm experiencing is closer to my fears than I think. Any advice is greatly appreciated. "

I've never had a pet before. I had a hamster, but it was like a family pet and not really mine. I was too young to take care of it. It's been many years and I think I'm more responsible now. I want a pet because there’s something so precious about them and how they'll always be there for me, etc. It also makes me sad to see them in pet shops where no one will buy them.

The issue is that my parents are split up. I am with each parent half time. I can't really take a pet back and forth so I need a pet that my parents can just feed. (There are 2 days of the week where I won't be at my mom's house. I can give attention to this future pet every other day of the week). Basically I want a pet that can be left alone for 8 hours. Also no cats, my family is allergic.

Passed eJPT,eLearnSecurity,1i9t3jm,2025-01-25 13:13:25,8,0.91,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/eLearnSecurity/comments/1i9t3jm/passed_ejpt/,AdFirm9664,,"After a lot of overthinking, and going through imposter syndrome.... I finally cracked the exam with flying colours. I have no prior experience in the field eJPT is basically my first hands-on certification, I did Google Cybersecurity professional certificate on course era to start my cyber exploration.

**The PREP:**  
I bought the INE Fundamentals subscription to get the eJPT course and certification voucher(I also got a course for ICCA along with its voucher) in June 2024, started learning it and then due to semester exams and after them, I had to prepare for competitive exams etc.. etc..and postponed the prep for until 26th Dec 2024 and on 26th I decided to continue the prep and planned for it, I started the prep from January 2nd. I studied every day for 6-7 hrs, watched videos in 2x and did all the modules, labs and The new Skill Checks in the same order as provided in the course. It took me 3 weeks to complete this with ample amount of distractions and breaks in the 3 weeks xD i.e., by 20th january. after it for 2 days I again went through only the Skill checks(13 of them I guess). and finally on 23rd morning at 11:30 am I redeemed my voucher and started my exam...

**The Exam:**

First things first, the exam is not an uphill task!!(I want to make this clear to all people who're willing to give the exam), I finished the exam in 12 hrs with breaks included. so The time is more than enough. You'll have the same browser terminal which we use for labs, Read the questions properly and carefully assess them. As the exam is MCQ's some of the answers can be assessed from the questions itself so, pay ATTENTION to the questions.

**My tips for the exam:**  
\- As soon as you start the exam try copy pasting all the questions to a notes and grade them based on the questions, like every 3-4 questions can be grouped and these set of questions can be answered from a single machine. Grade them based on your assumption, It'll help you, the questions are in random order i.e., the first,16th 29th and 34th questions can be on the Target machine 1...and so on.  
\-Don't panic during the exam, I went through this in the initial phase of exam like in the first 2 hrs as i had some 35 questiond ig, but later I settled down and solved the exam following the order of target machine's IP addresses (I exploited first machine, went through all the possible questions based on first machine and answered them)  
\- Take notes of everything you enumerated on system right from nmap scans to the final phase of post-exploitation(you don't need to do all phases of pentesting on every machine, don't overkill it xD i tried to exploit every system, uploaded stagers & meterpreters only to find that it's not required lmao)at one point I uploaded a webshell and exploited the target only to find an existing webshell in target's '/' directory lol and they mentioned the word command injection in one of the questions related to that target.  
\-you can access the ine course material, your notes and internet while giving the exam, It's open book.

**Things to follow during the course phase:**  
\- Use a good note making app/ tool (I used xmind),take note each and everything taught in the course, pay attention to every possible enumeration techniques being taught.( In one of videos alexis mentioned a alternative method at final 2 minutes of 34 min long video and as I was able to note it down, I exploited what was considered tough by my other friends who've given the exam 2 days before me in 30 minutes, they sat hours on it.  
\- Try understanding the methodology and enjoy the course.

**PS Don't over think** , If you've completed the entire course, and you were able to solve all the Skill check labs the second time with little help, you're good to go( don't tense up the first time, i was only able to solve 2 out of 4 or 5 flags at the beginning). I did no external suplementary stuff.

Feel free to reach out on any doubts or questions."

Obeying Trump order, Air Force will stop teaching recruits about Tuskegee Airmen
A video on the pioneering Black pilots, famed for their World War II exploits, was stripped from the basic training curriculum at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. A video about pathbreaking female aviators was also spiked.

President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders this week, including one banning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government.
President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders this week, including one banning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government.

Evan Vucci/Associated Press


President Donald Trump’s assault on federal diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has claimed a new victim – the Tuskegee Airmen.

A video describing the exploits of the groundbreaking African American airmen, whose combat service during World War II became the stuff of legend, has been removed from the instructional curriculum for new recruits at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, the hub of Air Force basic training.

Trump, in his inaugural address on Monday, vowed to ""end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life."" The same day, he signed an executive order dismantling federal DEI programs. On Tuesday, the new administration placed DEI officials on leave and ordered agencies to spike postings or advertisements promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

The effects were felt almost immediately at Lackland. A memo circulated among Air Force personnel said that ""in accordance with NEW DEIA Guidance,"" portions of the basic training curriculum were being revised ""immediately."" DEIA stands for diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility.

The memo said a video on the Tuskegee Airmen had been excised from a course on ""airmindedness.""

Also deleted were a second video titled ""Breaking Barriers"" and a third about the Women Airforce Service Pilots, an organization of civilian women who tested and delivered military aircraft during World War II, transported cargo and trained male pilots. Members of WASP were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.

In addition, a video on diversity was stripped from a human relations course for Air Force trainees, the memo said. It was addressed to ""ALCON,"" military jargon for ""all concerned.""

The 37th Training Wing, which oversees basic and technical instruction at Lackland, had no comment.

An Air Force official, who asked not to be identified, told the San Antonio Express-News by email: “We are ensuring we implement all directives outlined in the Executive Orders issued by the President and are currently doing a thorough review of all applicable curriculum. We will provide status updates on curriculum changes as soon as we are able.”

The official referred the Express-News to a directive issued Wednesday by an acting assistant secretary of the Air Force. It ordered all Air Force commands and units to strike references to DEI from their websites and social media accounts and “cancel any DEIA-related training and terminate any DEIA-related contract.”

Word of the curriculum revisions at Lackland shook retired Lt. Col. Olga Custodio, the Air Force’s first Hispanic female pilot.

“I don’t understand why eliminating history is going to make a difference,” said Custodio, 72, of San Antonio. “I don’t understand the relationship it has with the DEI programs that were established.”

She served in the Air Force for 24 years and went on to become the first Latina pilot at American Airlines. “Trying to take military history out of training or curriculum is trying to deny people the opportunity to form their own feelings and opinions and understand the culture behind everything that has happened in the past,” Custodio said.

Retired Army Sgt. Maj. Donald Sparks of Houston said the Trump administration was “whitewashing the valor and patriotism of African American soldiers who have fought in our nation's battles since the Revolutionary War.

“Over the past weeks, I've wondered: Why would an African American want to be a part of our armed forces in this current environment?” said Sparks, 56, a 31-year Army veteran who served in the Iraq War. “We have an administration and politicians, most of whom never served in uniform, trying to eradicate a ‘woke’ military.

“It's the same ‘woke’ military from when I joined the Army in 1988. That same ‘woke’ military fought victoriously in Desert Storm,” he said, referring to the 1991 military campaign that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.

'It's history, not DEI'
Every year, more than 35,000 recruits go through Air Force basic training at Lackland. For years, the 7½-week regimen of weapons training, calisthenics and classroom learning has included instruction on the Tuskegee Airman and how the pioneering Black pilots played a vital role in the Allied war effort. 

Well before World War II, the nation’s troops had been racially segregated, in part because of an Army War College report that wrote off the role Blacks could play as aviators, saying they lacked the courage and fortitude to fly planes. African Americans were relegated to noncombat jobs, even in the war zone. 

The all-Black 332nd Fighter Group, based at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama, shattered the race barrier. The unit had as many as 14,000 airmen 1,000 of them pilots. In the skies over war-torn Europe, they flew 15,533 sorties, racking up 112 aerial kills and earning 96 Distinguished Flying Crosses and three Presidential Unit Citations.

As the decades passed, their legend grew as books, news media attention and a Hollywood movie brought their exploits into America’s consciousness.

Some in their ranks went far in the armed services. Brig. Gen. Charles McGee lived through three wars and lived to see his 102d birthday. He marked the occasion by visiting Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in late 2021, where he received the red carpet treatment and was celebrated as a hero,

RELATED: Day before turning 102, Tuskegee airman gets red carpet at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph

McGee was given a tour of a squadron and its planes and was treated to a simulator flight in the T-1A Jayhawk, a training aircraft. McGee spoke in a briefing room adorned with portraits of his onetime boss, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who became the Air Force’s first Black one-star general. Another Tuskegee Airman, Daniel “Chappie” James, was the first Black officer to reach the rank of four-star general.

His son, Lt. Gen. Daniel James III, would serve as commander of the Air National Guard and adjutant general of the Texas National Guard.

Racial barriers continued to fall over the ensuing decades. Gen. C.Q. Brown, a San Antonio native, became the first African American to lead the Air Force in 2020. He is now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but not the first Black officer to hold the job. That honor belonged to the late Gen. Colin Powell.

The removal of the instructional videos on the Tuskegee Airmen quickly drew scorn from people commenting on a Facebook page devoted to Air Force enlisted personnel, Air Force Amn/Nco/Snco.

“None of that has to do with DEI, they should know the history of the Tuskegee Airmen,” one person wrote.

“That’s so dumb, that has nothing to do with the woke DEI!” another wrote.

“That is just stupid,” wrote retired Air Force Maj. Skeeter Lieberum, 72, of New Braunfels. “It's history, not DEI.”

The Tuskegee Airmen, he told the Express-News, ""are my heroes.""

'Overwhelming ... bias'
Members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots and several predecessor organizations that it absorbed were the first women to fly American military aircraft. Their role was to free male pilots for combat duty during World War II. They delivered aircraft from factories to military bases, conducted flight checks, towed targets for live anti-aircraft gun practice, simulated strafing missions and trained male pilot cadets.

WASP members flew fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft and collectively logged more than 60 million miles in the air. Thirty-eight of the female pilots died while performing these duties. In 1977, WASP members were granted veteran status.

The 2009 legislation that awarded them the Congressional Gold Medal said they “faced overwhelming cultural and gender bias against women in nontraditional roles and overcame multiple injustices and inequities in order to serve their country.”"

"Tried to make a system of rotating interests, completed it then lost interest lmao",AutisticWithADHD,1i9sthl,2025-01-25 13:01:26,10,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1i9sthl/tried_to_make_a_system_of_rotating_interests/,WolframAmarettoMocap,💁‍♀️ seeking advice / support,"Last year I have read a ton about ADHD and autism, you know the drill ""why am I like this? why am I sabotaging myself?"". Decided to get diagnosed for ADHD, tested positive and with such a strong suspicion of autism that it's not worth getting a separate diagnosis. Then I attempted to make some changes. What irked me in particular was my usage of phone - I mostly read, but it's either useless like reading wikis or learning of tabletop settings, or I focus on learning something interesting just to lose this interest just as I start to grasp anything. With so much time and potential wasted, I decided to tackle this issue.

I deleted nearly all tabs in browser, then created a mindmap where I chose 10 areas of knowledge in which I am either ignorant (law bores me to no end), are practical (math) or are my neglected interests (biology), then detailed initial points of focus so that I won't stare blankly at search bar. My diabolical plan was to roll a d10 die to choose a topic randomly then focus my attention on it for a given time, initially 5 days. The intention was to force myself to relearn how to learn consistently, gain broad knowledge that normally I would pass up on due to more pleasant things to do and cycle points of focus often enough so that my interest doesn't burn out. The project wrapped up, now to put it in life!

I failed at the second period! The first roll was for law, but I didn't want to disencourage myself and rerolled, math was way better. I actually spent 5 days recalling basic math in free time, but then I made a roll and basically forgot about it all because I was mildly inconvenienced in my daily life. Self-policing is hard and my difficulty with coming back to good habits reared its ugly head. Math-themed wallpaper adorned my laptop for two months, completely ignored.

Guess that I just needed to vent my annoyance with myself a little, but if anyone has any tips on how I can go back to it or alternative approaches to learning, I'm all ears. I can't just occupy myself with what's engaging at the moment, you know. And even a little stress or inconvenience makes me horribly unmotivated."

Silent Squeeze: How I Discovered My Hypertension,hypertension,1i9sjae,2025-01-25 12:49:07,0,0.33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1i9sjae/silent_squeeze_how_i_discovered_my_hypertension/,Normal_Mode_6963,,"I have always done what it takes to maintain a healthy life, even in my youth. Because of that, periodic visits to the doctor are made in consideration of my health. Nothing too serious, just the basic check-up: he takes my vitals, asks me a few questions, and then I am out of there.

One thing that has always stuck in my mind is when he took my blood pressure. He has never been the kind to give out the readings unless I ask him, and if I did, he'd say, ""It's fine, don't worry."" So I didn't.

But then I had been noticing one thing recently that really started catching my eye. Every time he would wrap the blood pressure cuff around my arm, it was tighter than I had previously experienced. It wasn't just a normal squeeze; it would hurt. That little hug changed into a crushing grip.

I thought to myself, Maybe the machine's acting up, or it is in my head. It wasn't. Every time he would check, the cuff inflated that if my arm throbbed afterward.

It wasn't just the cuff, though. I started feeling in my chest-those palpitations. They're always present, muffled and barely in the distance. But now, it grew louder, stronger, like some drumbeat I could no longer ignore.

Something was off, but I didn't know what. I kept thinking, Is he doing this because there's something wrong? Why won't he tell me?

One day, right after my appointment, a bad feeling in my gut was nagging me. My arm hurt from the cuff, and my chest was beating out of rhythm. Lying in bed that night, I replayed it in my head: silent blood pressure readings, tighter cuffs, growing discomfort.

Not able to stay in the dark anymore, with all the courage that I could find inside me, this time when he extended for that cuff again, I asked directly, ""Doc, is something wrong with my blood pressure? You've been checking it an awful lot lately, and truthfully, it has hurt a lot lately."".

He paused, looking at me with great care in his eyes, before he spoke: ""Oumaima, I did not want to make you worry unnecessarily; there is one thing that drew my attention in the trend. Your reading has been rather high, and I wanted confirmation over several visits before alarming you.""

The words hit me like a cold wave: higher than I'd like. ""You mean I have hypertension?"" I asked, my voice shaking.

He nodded softly. ""It's not serious, but your blood pressure has been high for quite a while. It's something we need to keep a close eye on and deal with.""

I felt a wave of emotions: fear, confusion, even anger. ""Why didn't you just tell me sooner?""

""I didn't want to stress you out,"" he said. ""But you're right. I should've been upfront.

After that visit, I plunged into learning about hypertension, how stress, diet, lack of sleep, and even genetics could play a role. It started to make sense-the late nights studying, skipping meals, my family history of heart problems.

Now, I learn to take charge. It isn't easy, and I had to make a few small changes: taking more walks, eating better, trying to find ways to relax. At times, I still feel the fear creeping in, especially when I think about what could have happened if I hadn't spoken up. But more than anything, I feel empowered.

If I've learned one thing, it's this: Your health is your responsibility, and staying silent isn't worth the risk."

"I think I'm gonna ""break up"" with my best friend",offmychest,1i9se3t,2025-01-25 12:42:52,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i9se3t/i_think_im_gonna_break_up_with_my_best_friend/,wild_dark_soul,,"(sorry for the extremely long text)

21yo male here. I've tried to put this into words for days, so, I dont even know if Im writing this as I should but I'll try to explain as best as I can.

Lets start from the beginning I guess. There's this guy I met at high school right on the first day. He's extroverted and I'm introverted, so he was the one who started to talk to me from time to time. He was kinda annoying but good-intentioned, a treat that was maybe exactly what I needed from someone so I could start to open and talk more. And that's what happened, we slowly became really good friends and we basically attented almost the entirety of high school together. It really seemed like we were gonna be best friends for a very long time, which was great because it was the first time I felt that I could keep a friend for longer than a couple of years... or at least thats what I thought.

Approximately a year after meeting was when things started to go wrong. I realized that I was starting to fall in love with him. It took me a couple months to realize that whatever weird feelings I started to have were all because I was in love. It was the first time I felt that for a man. So that made me realize I was maybe bi.  But the problem was that he was straight, so of course he only saw me as a friend, a really close one, but just a friend. It took me almost a year to finally have the balls to confess that to him, however, I didnt do it with the hope of getting a yes for an answer, I did it with the hope that maybe expressing what I was feeling would help me to get rid of those thoughts, even though I was scared to be rejected and lose the friendship. Thankfully, despite getting a no (which I expected), he didn't really reject me, he wanted to keep being friends with me, and even applauded me for having the guts the express my feelings. 

Even though at first it felt like that situation was over and we could keep being friends now, I later realized that wasnt really over unfortunately. The next couple of years could be summarized as me considering him my best friend while simultaneously thinking from time to time that maybe I was still gravitating towards him. At some point I thought of leaving but I ultimately stayed until now. So no, this isn't really the first time I'm thinking that maybe breaking up is the solution, but because of some events that happened last year, him getting in a relationship with a girl for the first time since we met, and one particular reunion I had with him a couple weeks ago, I once again started to feel that, but this time is different. This time I'm thinking that maybe that is the best thing I could do cause nothing else seems to work, and for the first time, feeling that I'll maybe be better without him, while simultaneously denying it cause if it happens it would be a huge loss for me: losing a 6-years crush and the closest I've had to a best friend at the same time. When you lose your partner you go to your buddies and besties to cope with that loss, when you lose a really close friend and are lucky to have someone who really loves you by your side, that special someone will be there to help you cope with that. But what do you do when you lose those two types of loved ones at the same time?

This is where the confussion strikes me cause on the one hand he's been my friend for so long, so I don't wanna lose him so easily, but on the other hand, if I don't do anything different to get rid of the romantic love I feel for him, then when is it gonna end? What do I have to do to only see him as a friend? Maybe spending time away from him sounds helpful but, thats what I've been doing since we're studying different careers, so its not like I'm seeing him everyday, but when I do, those feelings come back. These last couple of weeks have been tough, its like Im going through the 5 stages of grief: I've been denying the problem and thinking that maybe its just my anxiety, feeling kinda jealous that he's probably happy with this girlfriend while I can't get that from him, wondering what else I could do to solve the problem without getting any answers, feeling desperate for the potential loss and fearing I won't find anyone like him... and also, feeling ready to accept that maybe thats the best thing I could do and seeing a future without him where everything is ok and finally moving on.

I've also come to a wild conclusion to maybe give myself a better motive to break up (at this point I'm more inclined to do it than refusing to do so): what if this friendship was kinda the result of me conforming with what he can offer while internally repressing my visions of the life I dreamed with him. This maybe sounds like I'm going too far but when I think about it I realize that I'm not only feeling sad cause I had to get rid of my crazy borderline creepy thoughts of me being in a relationship with him, I'm also realizing that I'm not really getting what I want from a best friend, I feel like I should feel better, happier with this friendship but a lot of times I've felt like its not enough, there are some things I wish he did and others I would like to do but dont really get enough trust or support to do them. It's like I never had a best buddy and it all has been my illusions this whole time.

To be honest I decided to write this and let people see this with the intention of getting advice cause initially I genuinely didnt know what to do, but now that I've discussed this situation with some other friends I have, I think I've come to the conclusion that maybe that's actually the best I can do. So with all that being said I think I'm not really looking for advice, of course if someone has some suggestion I'll listen, but now it's more about putting into words this situation so I can decide what's best. So yeah, I think I'm gonna break up with my best friend with whom I've been in love with for 6 years, cause hopefully by doing that, it will be the end of my grief and the beginning of a new chapter in my life without him. Maybe I'll regret this and mourn those 6 years, but maybe its actually time to say goodbye and move on.

Edit: I'm reading this long ass text and I realized I didnt mention this: I'm totally gonna discuss all the things I mentioned here with him. Regardless of what I decide, I'm gonna talk with him cause I think he should definitely be aware of this.
And that's it for today. If you're reading this, thank you so much for your attention "
Jay3 (and others) vs random on Twitter,OverwatchTMZ,1i9scfl,2025-01-25 12:40:48,89,0.84,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchTMZ/comments/1i9scfl/jay3_and_others_vs_random_on_twitter/,DanielTinFoil,Streamer/Community Juice,"Hard to link anything because the random deleted their twitter, but here's a retelling of the events: Guy tweeted about his disappointment in OW creators in general seemingly moving onto Rivals, then specifying an encounter he had with Jay3 that furthered his disappointment. Supposedly, the guy typed in chat asking about whether Jay will try the 6v6 playtest, to which Jay responded with ""We don't talk about overwatch here"" which kind of upset the guy.

This tweet, for some reason, ended up kind of blowing up with 10k likes (last I saw at least. Jay's newest tweet claims it had 30k) and over a million views. The replies to this tweet were mostly supportive, agreeing with the OP while also adding examples of other creators who they are disappointed in for having ""left"" Overwatch, like Flats, with some even going so far as to straight up throw out insults, most being directed at Jay3 for this interaction he had with OP.

Some replies were not all in agreement with OP or the people replying, saying things like, ""Jay3 was *clearly* joking"" (note: at this point no had a clip, everyone was merely responding to OP's tweet) and that, even if he wasn't, ""lmao, who cares if he doesn't to play or talk about Overwatch?""

Jay3 and other creators then started replying to the OP's tweet, with Flats mentioning he may make a video addressing this general sentiment, and Wanted saying ""Yeah bro we've played this game for several years ofc we'd want to try other things lol"" 

Jay3's responses in particularly were met with a *lot* of criticism and pushback. You can read some of the replies to his first reply [here](https://x.com/Jay3OW/status/1883007415831953530). And, keep in mind if you don't care to personally go through this yourself, he made several other tweets that got similar pushback. This wasn't a ""this one response got mild pushback"" thing, it was ""everything he said got pushback"".

Quite a bit of the pushback was centered around two things: ""Why are you replying lmao/who cares/this random guy was just stating his opinion"" and ""Why are you making yourself a victim?"", if you're wondering the same thing, you have to remember Jay was getting *a lot* of shit for this minor interaction with OP *before* he replied. He saw a bunch of people hating on him for a joke and/or because he hasn't been playing Overwatch, didn't like it, and decided to respond. Once more, 10-30K likes on the tweet, shit blew up and a lot of people had a lot to say about him.

(if you're wondering why I'm not linking any, it's because you cannot sort by hour on twitter, and with the guy deleting his account, I'd have to search his @ and then scroll through hundreds and hundreds of tweets to find the ones from 18\~ hours ago that were shitting on him)  

There's a bit more, as again other streamers responded as well and got varied responses back, but that's basically it. Jay3 made a comment about Overwatch. Guy on Twitter got upset. Other people dogpiled on Jay and other streamers for it along with the fact that they stopped streaming Overwatch.

...[and then someone who works with(?) Jay3 pulled up that streams chat logs](https://x.com/Zencep_NA/status/1883057686943564204). Then showed, with proof, that this interaction did not even happen as it was initially described. Jay3 made that comment about not talking about Overwatch in the Marvel Rival's game chat, and was just repeating what he was typing out loud. And, as you might imagine if you watch the clip, yeah, it was a joke. Obviously it was a joke. How could it have ever not been a joke.

But still, who cares, right? Like, a guy made a vent post, it blew up, Jay got some shit whatever, right? Hell, *I'm* super omega cringe for even writing all this up, it's that much of a nothing-burger. It's not even OP's fault or anything, really. Jay wasn't being hostile to the guy either, he understood mistakes happen, and OP's not responsible for random people on Twitter... Right?

...But then, why, even after being corrected about the interaction, the guy didn't delete his tweet? Make a correction? Apologize? Why did he just.... [start fucking lying](https://x.com/Zencep_NA/status/1883190073971114058/photo/1) about never having mentioned Jay? ""It was never meant to be taken seriously"" he says, but the tweet that is contributing to Jay (and again, other streamers too) getting hate is still up? Just... delete the tweet? Why is he not deleting the tweet? It was 8+ hours after it was explained that this interaction straight up did not happen, and just... nothing. 

Then, I guess, he had enough of being called out and deleted his account.

Jay went from tweeting [""You’re good bro, it’s just a conversation and we’re fine tbh. I don’t dislike you or hate you. Other people on the other hand. They just hate for no reason""](https://x.com/Jay3OW/status/1883029575611105425) to[ 'bro lied, deletes account, anything for attention'](https://x.com/Jay3OW/status/1883180124914274472) because this guy would just not delete his tweet.

Now, that's kind-of-sorta where the drama ends. Except Jay is still getting shit for his earlier response, and for having responded in the first place.

And wow hey before I was about to post this, [Questron ](https://x.com/Questr0n/status/1883195859602645268)even chimed in, siding with the OP.[](https://x.com/Jay3OW/status/1883029575611105425)"

## Exploring the Key Features of a Kitty Condo Litter Box

With the market saturated with various designs,it’s crucial to understand which features offer the best combination of functionality,aesthetics,and cat comfort. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements to consider when comparing diffrent *kitty condo litter box* options:

### Design and Aesthetics

The *stylish litter box* is more than just a container; it’s a piece of furniture that needs to blend with your home’s decor.

The *litter box that looks like furniture* options are especially useful, designed to be indistinguishable from regular furniture. Many designs try to mimic bedside tables, cabinets, or even small chests. This allows the unit to feel more like a planned design element rather of an afterthought.

### Functionality and Storage

A good *litter box with storage* maximizes space and keeps essential supplies handy. Look for models that include compartments for scooping tools, extra litter, or even cleaning wipes. Built-in shelving,drawers,or baskets can help maintain a clutter-free environment. Practicality and easy access are key, ensuring that maintaining your cat's litter area is convenient and efficient. this additional functionality speaks to the demand for *multifunctional cat furniture*.

### Size and Space Considerations

Considering that many cat owners are living in urban/suburban environments with limited space, a *small space litter box solution* is essential. The dimensions of the *kitty condo litter box* must align with the available space, ensuring both that it doesn’t encroach on living space and its usability for your cat. Measure before you buy, and visualize it in your room to be sure that it is indeed a good fit. Look for options that are designed with space efficiency in mind,perhaps with a smaller footprint.

### Cat Comfort and Privacy

A cat's comfort is paramount when choosing a litter box. The *cat hideaway litter box* design shoudl, first and foremost, prioritize the cat's access, ease of maneuverability, and natural instincts. The internal space must be large enough for a comfortable turn while also being enclosed enough to create a feeling of security. This is particularly important if you have multiple cats. The enclosure for a *covered litter box* should be well ventilated to mitigate odor and allow for fresh air circulation.

### Durability and Materials

A durable *integrated cat litter box condo* is an investment, not a short-term purchase. Opt for high-quality materials that are easy to clean and tough enough to withstand daily wear and tear. Solid wood, composite wood, and sturdy plastics are all good choices, offering a balance of aesthetics and resilience. Avoid flimsy materials that may break down or become unsanitary.

## Actionable Insights for Choosing the Right Kitty Condo Litter Box

Choosing the right *kitty condo litter box* involves balancing your cat's needs with your aesthetic preferences and practical concerns.Here are actionable insights to help you make the best decision:

Consider not just where it will stand but also how easily you will be able to access it to clean and change the litter.This ensures that there’s enough room around the unit for usage and placement.

### Match Your Home's Style

Evaluate your current decor and choose a *designer litter box* that complements your aesthetic.If your home is primarily modern, opt for clean lines, neutral tones and minimalist design. If your space has a rustic appeal, find something with aged wood and a natural finish.

### Read Reviews and Compare

Look at customer ratings and reviews to understand real-world experiences with different litter box furniture options. Pay special attention to comments regarding durability, ease of assembly, and how well it serves the main purpose to control odor and mess. Pay attention to ratings and reviews relating to *cat house with litter box* and compare the features that are most important to you.

### Consider the Ease of Cleaning

Easy access for changing litter is just as important as the litter box's design. For a *litter box hider* that will be used daily be sure it is indeed not a challenge to maintain and clean. Look for models with removable trays, doors that open easily, and smooth, wipeable surfaces.

### Think Long Term

While price is a factor, consider the long-term value. A well built and durable *kitty condo litter box* will be a worthwhile investment for years to come. Cheaper products may need replacing due to poor craftsmanship or low quality build.

        - This ensures any date-based functions will work correctly.
    
    4. **Rename Columns**  
        - Right-click on `Sales` → **Rename** to `TotalSales`.  
        - Use descriptive names to clarify each field.
    
    5. **Close & Load**  
        - Click **Close & Load** to add the transformed table into Excel.  
        - Now your data is clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis.
    
    ---
    
    ## 8. Troubleshooting Common Errors
    
    Here are some frequent messages users encounter:
    
    1. **Expression.Error: The Column X of the table was not found.**  
       - **Cause**: Mismatch between the column name in your step and the actual data.  
       - **Fix**: Double-check spelling and query steps to ensure the column exists.
    
    2. **DataFormat.Error: We couldn't parse the input provided as a Date value.**  
       - **Cause**: A non-date value or inconsistent date format.  
       - **Fix**: Convert the column to text first, clean invalid entries, then convert to date again.
    
    3. **Formula.Firewall: Query 'X' (Step 'Y') references other queries or steps, so it may not directly access a data source.**  
       - **Cause**: Privacy levels or data source settings are blocking certain transformations.  
       - **Fix**: Adjust privacy levels in **Data Source Settings** or use the **Combine** feature within a single data source context.
    
    4. **DataFormat.Error: We couldn't parse the input provided as a Number value.**  
       - **Cause**: Non-numeric characters or inconsistent decimal separators.  
       - **Fix**: Strip or correct invalid characters (e.g., commas in numeric values). Convert to number once cleaned.
    
    5. **Expression.Error: The key didn't match any rows in the table.**  
       - **Cause**: Merge or join steps referencing a key that doesn’t exist in one dataset.  
       - **Fix**: Confirm that the join column exists in both queries and that there are matching records.
    
    6. **File Not Found Error**  
       - **Cause**: Incorrect file path or filename used in the **Source** step.  
       - **Fix**: Verify the file path, name, and ensure the file is accessible from the specified location.
    
    ---
    
    ## 9. Final Note
    
    - **Focus on Data Accuracy**: Power Query can handle a variety of data sources, but careful setup ensures results remain trustworthy.  
    - **Keep It Modular**: Reference queries help maintain a clean, logical flow of transformations.  
    - **Encourage Exploration**: Experiment with different merges, filters, and function options to see how each affects the dataset.
