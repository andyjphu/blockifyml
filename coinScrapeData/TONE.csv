AITA - For going no contact with my childhood best friend for not picking my side?,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1i9t6n6,2025-01-25 13:17:15,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i9t6n6/aita_for_going_no_contact_with_my_childhood_best/,Altruistic-Lack-1709,AITA,"Hi Charlotte, I love your videos you always cheer me up, you’re actually the reason that gave me the curage to write this story down. This is a really long one so buckle up. I wanted to vent about this story for a while and never had the time, I also apologize in advance for any errors, I’m Romanian and I live in Italy so english isn’t my first language.

  
Me (23F) and my childhood best friend (23M) who we’ll call Simon, have known each other since we were 8 years old, I always thought of him as a brother and we were always together until the end of elementary school. Unfortunately, we ended up drifting apart during the three years of middle school since I had to transfer schools due to economic reasons, but we later on found each other again through a mutual friend after we entered high school. In high school, I met a girl we’ll call her Bee, she and I didn’t start on the right foot, she was kind of my bully but I never faulted her for it because it was instigated by another girl and Bee was easy to manipulate. After two yers this other girl ended up ghosting Bee in real life, ignoring her as if she had never existed, I felt kind of bad for her so I ended up keeping her company and in the end befrending her. Around the same time I met my current best friend, we call her Dy. Dy actually helped me a lot in high school since I was struggling with depression and self harm because of various situations that I had at home, at school and with my boyfriend of that time with whom I had a very toxic relationship that lasted six to seven years. Dy was there for me through it all, she helped me pick myself up and with my mother she helped me understand my worth little by little, to me she is my saviour that I platonically love.

During the years Simon, Bee, Dy and I formed quite a tight group, we all knew each other‘s secrets each other‘s weaknesses each other’s problems and we always helped each other out because of that. That was until three years ago when I finally decided to end things with my toxic boyfriend once and for all. I was struggling because it had been quite the long run and I couldn’t immagine something outside of that kind of relationship, so moving forward was very difficult, but like always I had Dy come to the rescue. Because of that Simon seemed to become insecure. He started to rant to me that I was giving Dy preferential treatment, that she knew more about me than he did, and he didn’t like it. I tried reassuring him but it didn’t work. 

A couple of months after my break up, Simon decided to introduce to me a friend of his, we’ll call him Alex. Around the same time Bee got herself a bf, at the time I was genuenly happy for her as I was also starting to come out of my shell and then the problems began. For starters after Bee got into a relationship and as I started talking more with Alex, Simon became even more paranoid, this time starting to talk to Bee behind my back, calling me a bad friend because I didn’t make enough time for him. I didn’t know of this until later on because I had to focus on myself since my health started deteriorating, I began having trouble breathing but for months it was treated as bronchitis so the doctor started to prescribe me cortison pills, those pills had me gain 5 kg, I didn’t feel bad but having my father and Simon call me fat, wasn’t exactly good for my mental health.

Simon and Bee slowly started to become closer, I was actually happy that two people I cared about were on good terms, but that soon turned on me. Simon and Bee became a bit demanding, they started saying I wasn’t contacting them often enough, that I was way too busy to hang out with them, and that wasn’t good because they were supposed to be my priority, they started reprimanding me that a good friend shouldn’t avoid the important people in their life, and with every comment like that I would witness Dy rolling her eyes into oblivion for how ridiculous they sounded.

 I honestly taught nothing of it but then things ended up, becoming even weirder. After I started going on dates with Alex, Simon seemed to become more and more irritated he said he wasn’t sure I considered him a best friend anymore. I tried to reassure him multiple times but to no avail, little did I know he started badmouthing me to Alex after talks of starting a relationship came up.

Alex didn’t want to tell me what actually happened and I let it be because later on, one disaster after another started to appear. Bee had done volunteering work since middle school in medical practices since her mother was a paramedic, and yet she was (sarcastic tone incoming) smart enough to decide to not use any contraceptives with her bf, with him finishing inside. So lo and behold… she ended up pregnant (fake shocked expression). The fact of the matter is that she never wanted kids so she was in a panic, I tried to help her the best I could but her bf was keeping her away from us so all I could do was provide information. I found out later that she went to Simon and told him: “M is useless, I could find this information by myself she is not helping in the slightest she is too caught up in her own problems like the world revolves around her.” It’s honestly hilarious that both Bee and Simon ended up ranting to Dy, cause she is kinda over protective of me.Later on Bee talked to Dy, her bf had her prescribe abortion pills to take every day (no such pill exist) the only pill that I know of that is for daily use are vitamins, so the whole situation was sus, especially with the fact that after three months she was still pregnant.

Fastforward to halloween night: pure disaster. I organized a dinner party inviting Dy, Bee and Simon and another group of friends. During the dinner Bee that came with her bf (this will be important later) texted me: “I don’t like these people they yell too much I don’t wanna interract with them.” Since I wanted to enjoy myself I let her be, she, Simon and her bf isolated themselves from the rest of the group for the rest of the night which seamed weird to everyone else so I joked about them being my little antisocial friends, something that all 4 of us said and had been joking about for yers since I tend to be quite the social butterfly (wee), and that tends to be draining for all three of them. Strangely enough this time around Dy was the only one who laught in agreement wile Bee and Simon stayed silent. 

That night after I got home, my phone started blowing up with notifications from Bee and Simon. Simon was asking me why I attacked Bee during dinner, not understanding what he was talking about I asked him to elaborate, he told me that I called them antisocial, which pissed them off and because of that they felt like they had to isolate themselves. I had a wierd feeling about this, I asked what he was talking about, we have been joking about this thing for yers and as a matter of fact they were the ones who started saying it referring to themselves as antisocial. He said that he wasn’t actually important to me and that being an airhed wasn’t a real thing but just an excuse to not pay attention to someone who you don’t care about. That hurt me a lot because I am naturally clumsy and get distracted very easely thanks to also having adhd, I can’t help it I sometimes forget things And I belive it happens to everyone, but for him I was just making excuses for myself and I needed to find a solution to fix myself because no matter how many times I messed up and felt bad about it I never changed to make the other person feel better. Being the doormat I was back then I agreed with him ending the conversation there.

Now on to Bee, she said almost the same things but started calling me selfish since: how dare I think of myself for once and enjoy a nice evening while she was in a crappy situation. (Major eyeroll from Dy) I was shocked but her rant didn’t end there she said: “I can overlook the fact that you didn’t wanna be nice to me and Cory and didn’t want to let us interact with the others althought it shouldn’t be this difficult to give priority to the truly important people of your life, but you could at least integrate my bf in the rest of the group.” My response to her was along the lines of: “Okay first of all, you were the one who told me you didn’t want to interract with any of them so how could I force you to talk to someone you clearly don’t like, and second, I introduced your bf to the group, I don’t know him that well but like the rest of us he is now over 20 he should be capable to speak for himself. What was I supposed to do take him by the hand and be like: kids this il bleep he will be joining us today, remember to play nice with each other? Should I have treated a guy my age and twice my size like a kindergarten kid?” Oh by she didn’t like that one bit, so after she told me that I was a b-word for taking the side of the others (she actually ment Gina, a mutual friend that she actually hates), insulting the rest of my friends calling them names and taking Simon’s side, she ended the conversation with: “You’re lucky I decided not to be a b-word and ruin you right then and there for how you behaved.” She didn’t speak to me for a week. 

I showed Dy the chats, she was baffled, and on the verge of committing murder, she had me call Gina and also tell her what transpired. Gina was worried that this happened because of her and Bee’s rivalry, she never had anything against Bee but didn’t want to be the cause of me being hurt so she contacted her. Same day I recive two notifications almost at the same time, Bee: “The b wrote to me, do you have something to do with this?” And Simon: “Hey what’s going on with Bee?”, in my head I was like: al least try not to make it obvious that you spoke to eachother. I responded to Bee: “Hi to you too I’m good thanks, it’s so great that you start conversations pointing fingers when I have no idea what you’re talking about.” I swear I was so done with this. She sent me a screenshot of her chat with Gina, the genius in her didn’t think of controlling to cut the top part of the picture that had the time stamp of 15 minutes prior to her sending me a message, and with even more unfortunate timing a notification that red: Simon: try to make her talk. I felt betrayed and once again Dy was planning how to kill them, while I decided To not contact the two of them for a while.

At the beginning of December, I was phisically getting worse so I kinda forgot about tha whole thing since my main concern was my health. Arownd the same time Alex and I became a couple so while I was organizing my birthday party I obviously invited him.five days before the party after me and Alex got together, trgedy struck, Cora my beloved 14 year old german shepperd passed away in my arms, she was always lively for her age, that same evening she jumped on the table to steal food, two hours later she acted like she felt sick, she stopped moving and in the span of an hour she was gone while I stroke her head that she put on my lap one last time. I had already preppered everything for the birthday party so I couldn’t cancel, Dy had in her bag and entire farmacy for me because I was also struggling to stand or walk for more than 5 minutes. Simon arrived late along with Alex, him being my bf I said hi to him first, then I turned to Simon and sked jokingly: “Aren’t you gonna hug me?” He looked at me and retorted: “That’s rich coming from you since you ignored me the moment I entered.” I let it be since I didn’t want to ruin my day because I was also still mourning my dear Cora, for that matter Dy prepared the best gift ever: a handsown cushon with the siluette of my darling Cora sown on it. I started crying the moment I opened the package wit her and Alex hugging me but from the cornr of my eye I saw Simon eyerolling as if I was being drammatic. The evening ended on a cheerful note, but the rest of december was awfoul.

I was officially to stay at home under medication (again) after the party, and exactly five days later, ten days after Cora passed, my 19 year old cat Mel also passed away in my arms, she was struggling for the past two months so we were actually happy we didn’t have to put her down but it still hurt.

Two days later all hell broke loose: Simo called an decided to yell at me dragging arownd the halloween problem telling me that I was insensitive that I should have considered Bee’s side because now she had miscarried at four months endangering her life and ending up in the hospital. Unfortunately I couldn’t process this information very well, I was sick, full of pills, and mourning my life companions so I was distracted during the conversation, the result was him throwing a fit about my birthday, how could I say hi to Alex before hime since he was the one to enter first through the door, how dare I sit next to Dy (who had my farmacy in her bag) and Alex (my bf who knew no one except me, Simon and Dy) instead of having him sit near me, he had priority he had to be near me and not anyone else, he also started sayng that it was impossible for a person to be as distracted as I am and that with Dy I was certainly like that. Te moment I told him I was actually like that with everyone including Dy he asked me: “And she’s seriously okay with you being the way you are? Impossible.” The guy drove me into an histeric attac, my parents came to end the call on my behalf since I was a mess and couldn’t stop yelling and crying, il almost looked like my veins were about to pop up.

After I calmed down I called Dy to tell her everything, she calmed me down and told me to call Alex and figure out what Simon really said behind my back since he didn’t want to tell me before. What came out was absurd to say the least. Alex and Simon had fought after the party that day because certain personal thoughts of Simon came to light. He told Alex that how dare he sit next to me, it didn’t matter that he was my bf because Simon said he was supposed to have me. He told Alex tha he always saw him as inferior and introduced him to me thinking that if an inferior person like him coul have ashot with me he could definetly have me. The moment Alex and I started to actually become more serious about echother Simon changed his tctic,he started telling Alex that I was cheap, that I was greedy and that all I wanted from guys was phisical sadisfaction, when the plan of making me look bad so Alex would loose interest backfired he lost it and started  having it out for me because if he couldn’t have me he would destroy me. Bee was no better, yes she had a bf that left her pregnant, she always had a thing for Simon, since she couldn’t have him she got bitter the moment I was avalable, and when he started ranting about what was happening she tried to put him against me so she coul have a shot with him.

Dy gave a pice of her mind to both of them and started writing down in a journal every mean thing they said saving parts of every chat with them for blackmail purposes, I obviously will never let her use it first of all because those two are a waste of time, and second I am too poor to pay her way out of jail, and breaking her out is out of the question sice life on the run isn’t for nither of us (joking about the whole thing obviously). I cut all contacts with the two of them, Bee despite the whole disaster with the miscarriage is alive and well, sleeping around with guys after breaking up with her bf for cheating on her. Simon was talking about moving to another county bu I have no idea what happened to him but he seemes well. Alex and I drifted apart for varoius resons but we ended everithing on good terms, Dy is still by my side like she always was, Gina and I go ice skating together from time to time, I now have a new kitty and puppy, I call them the tornado cuties, my helth is slowly improving after three years and I finally decided to start university, so as you can see life goes on.

  


And now for the big question AITA? "
Suru,stories,1i7108t,2025-01-21 21:52:48,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i7108t/suru/,Specialist_Street758,Fiction,"So I had to write a narrative essay for my English class. 8 pages and she never graded it. It's not really that good but I think writing short stories is fun. If you could tell me what to do better 👍

The Story of Suru
*Before*
Wind whistles through the harsh and frigid landscape of  Finland. A young boy and his father step through the thick snow, the man, a large man of brute stature, is holding a basket of fish and a rod. The boy, a short kid, walks beside him holding a pole as well.
“We’ll be fed for a week, won’t we Pa!” The boy tells his father as they walk in an energetic tone. 
“Yes we will.” The man says over the whistling wind, his voice deep and scratchy.
As they walk further, their cabin is just through the trees, they begin walking faster as the snow picks up its pace. Their sight is almost completely obscured as they walk. The man holds his son’s shoulder, so as to not lose him.
“Only a short distance now.” The man says to his son.
A woman opens the door, stepping outside holding a lantern. The boy sees the lantern and runs towards it, the man starts walking faster with the boy. The boy runs to the woman, the man soon after. As they step inside the warm fire warms the room, the candle light and fire giving the room a warm atmosphere. The man sets the basket of fish down and his fishing pole by the door.
“Get to bed now, Suru.” The mother says in a warm, gentle tone.
“Okay ma.” The young boy, Suru, says.

*The Ship*
Suru awakes on his fathers ship, a large one, usually used when he went to battle. The ship was crowded, small, and smelt of must and salt water. There were crates of food, and lanterns hanging from the ceiling. On the other side of Suru was another hammock, a man with a large brown beard and tattoos. Suru got up, stretching his arms and legs. He walked through the corridor of the lower level of the ship, assuming he would find his father somewhere on his ship. Suru walked up a small staircase, snow was falling through the opening, the wind was howling through the hall. The ship's flag was whipping in the wind, making a cracking sound as it did so; the flag had a sword and an ax, as well as a symbol Suru was unfamiliar with. There was chatter coming from a door, Suru went towards the sound, curious on what they might be talking about.
“We mustn't invade the Danes sir, they simply have too large of an army!” a man’s voice said in a loud but serious tone.
“Do you think our men are inferior to the common Danes?” Suru’sfather said. 
“But Raaka, this is a dire matter, we will be killed out there!” Another voice spoke up, in a fearful but a nervous tone.
“Do you doubt our capabilities?” Raaka, Suru’s father said in a confident tone, his voice loud and clear.
“I don’t sir… but they have thousands, we have a mere 500.” The other man’s voice spoke up, his voice showing his nervousness.
Suru opens the door, the freezing wind walking in with him. The room has candles and hanging lanterns, their flames dance with the wind as they find each other. 
“Ah, Suru, there you are.” Raaka said
“Pa? Is everything alright?” Suru said, his voice a little saddened from hearing the conversation. 
“No, nothing is alright. Your old man has gone mad.” One of the men said, presumably another warrior.
Suru closes the door. The flames and wind fall down as they stop dancing together, separating once again. The room falls silent, the wood creaking and squeaking.
“Pa… you aren’t going to fight another battle are you?” Suru said in a worry filled voice, voicing his concern.
“We are.”
“But pa-”
“This is not a matter for you to discuss.”
“But I don’t want you to die.”
Raaka softens as he hears his son’s comment. The room falls silent once again. The waves crash, and the wind whistles a song to the flames. The other men in the room stand tall, confident in not wanting war for them, nor the grief that Suru would have to endure.
“Don’t think of it like that. No one ever dies, this life is just the beginning compared to the eternity of fighting in Valhalla.” Raaka lets out a small chuckle wanting to ease Suru’s sadness.
“But then you’ll leave me and ma, I don’t like that.” Suru says 
“I promise this will be the last battle, son. I promise.”
“You said that 3 years ago too…”
“I know but the Danes threaten our land. Our land, trees, grass, animals. Our life.”
Suru falls silent. Not wanting to push the subject further, knowing he won’t change his fathers mind.
“I know Suru, this is difficult. But we wanted to take you with us so you can become a true warrior for Odin.”
Suru looks down at the floor, turning around and opening the door.
“Wait. There’s one thing you should have.” Raaka walks over to a little chest and unlatches the gleaming metal lock. He opens it and in a modest bunch of straw is a beautiful dagger . On the cutting edge itself engraved into it is “Todellinen soturi ei tarvitse asetta”, Finnish for “A true warrior does not need a weapon”. The handle is a dark and rich wood with smooth calfskin folding over it. The hilt is a darkened steel, gold engraved into fragile and exquisite plans. The beat is gold also, smooth and round. Raaka carefully picks it up, and walks to Suru.
“Suru. I give this to you, as my father once did for me. This is for you, today you take your first life with this dagger.”
“But Pa I don’t want to kill or fight. Why can’t we talk to them?”
Raaka sheathes the knife into a leather holster, fastening it to Suru’s belt. 
“Now go rest, we have a busy day today.”
“Okay…”
Suru opens the door, the singing wind and fire of the candles being reunited, being able to dance once more. The wind cries out as they separate when Suru closes the door. The fire falls to the hot wax of the candle as the wind gets pulled away. Suru walks, head hung low, across the creaking wood and crunching snow. He walks down the stairs into the lower levels of the ship. The snores and grumbles of other shipmates shake the ship. Suru climbs up into his hammock, knowing what he will have to do. Suru’s eyes grow heavy as his hammock rocks with the waves. He soon falls into the cradle of mother slumber, finding peace once again.

*Father is Due*
The ship shakes and the wood lets out screeching cries as it bends and shifts. Suru wakes up, rubbing his eyes, removing the sandman’s sand from his eyes. He looks to the side of him, to the hammock on his left, a little lower than he is. The man from before isn’t there. Suru gets up and walks through the dark room, grabbing a lantern. He shines the lantern over the hammocks. No one is in them, but why? He walks slowly so as to not make a sound to the other room. None in them either. Suru walks through the corridor, there is no light except his lantern. The floorboards creak and scream. The door at the end is illuminated from the window, the panes of glass glow as fire dances with the wind. Suru grabs the doorknob and slowly turns it. He peeks out from behind the door. Another ship has docked next to Suru’s. A bridge connecting them, men from the other side, screaming and chanting “Erobre! Samle dem alle sammen!” Suru’s eyes widen in terror, his fathers men screaming and crying for the gods as they get killed. Their blood flying in the air, mixing with the snow. Their swords fall and clink on the wooden floor of the bow. Suru screams for his dad as he runs out into the chaos. 
“What are you doing! Get out of here!!” A man says as he looks back, sacrificing his life to warn Suru. His head falls to the ground, and rolls to Suru. Raaka runs to Suru and grabs his arm.
“Today is the day you kill. Okay son? You have to.” Raaka says as they run over his dead men and red snow. He grasps Suru’s arm tightly.
Suru screams and cries as they run.
“What’s happening pa? I’m scared.” Suru screams as tears run down his cheeks.
“Gah!” Raaka gets hit by an arrow, piercing his back. Raaka grabs Suru, swiftly putting Suru in front of him. 
“Pa! No!” Suru cries out.
“I’ve survived worse.” Raaka lets out a pained chuckle
Another arrow hits Raaka, and another, and another, the two more. Raaka’s eyes dim as death encroaches. Raaka’s breathing slows as he smiles at Suru
“Suru… Don’t you die out here. Go..” Death grabs Raaka’s soul, and takes him to wherever he may go. Raaka’s soulless body looms over Suru, 6 arrows piercing his back, blood dripping from his mouth and splattering onto the virgin snow. His blood leaks from his back, staining his tunic. 
“Vittu te tanskalaiset!!” Suru screams at the killers. The captain of the ship, a tall man with a cold glare and brown hair flowing through the wind's hands. His eyes are almost like those in myths, those of monsters. The damned even. His hip was armed with a broadsword.
“Nadeslos! He’s dead! But what of the kid?” One of the captain's men asked from across the ship.
“Let him go.” Nadeslos says, his voice stern and authoritative.
“Yes sir…” The Dane replies, the tone of his voice questioning his captain’s decision.
With that announcement, Nadeslos and his crew walk off of Suru’s ship, the boards creak and mourn the loss of Raaka. Nadeslos’ crew takes up the bridge connecting the two ships and departs.

*The Island*
Suru is alone on his ship. A ship meant for a hundred, now only him. The bodies of men he knew and friends lay on the saturated wood flooring. His father still stands, arms outstretched with arrows in his back, dead.
Suru sits there for hours, maybe days? He doesn’t know. His body has been covered in snow for a while, that is all he knows. He does not want to move, he’s not sure he can. From his eyes there is no hope, all alone in an ocean. He doesn’t even know where they were headed. He takes his fathers gift, the blade he had gotten as a gift. He takes it from its sheath and holds the blade in his hand. He feels the slight curve of the blade in his hand, the smoothness of the leather wrapped handle. His fingers trace along the engraved message. 
He drifts in the open ocean for days, no weeks. The waves crash against the sides of the ship, it rocks back and forth. Suru sits there, the snow has melted away. There's land over the horizon. Mountains, green, seems calm for now.  A few days go by, the land approaches closer and closer. The ship crashes onto the rocks, Suru falls over on impact. He gets up, stepping over the rotten corpses of the crew, manslaughtered by the Danes. He climbs over the side of the toppled ship. Falling onto the sharp rocks he gets cuts on his knees and arms. He hikes up the sharp jagged rocks, his arms and knees bleeding as he does so. He walks and walks, his back hunched over as he wanders through the long green grass. He collapses.

*The Family*
Suru awakes in a straw bed. A fireplace crackles as it burns wood, A woman sits on a wooden chair reading a book. She is an older woman, gray hair, motherly blue eyes, wrinkled skin. She looks over and stands, setting down her book on the table, it lays face down. The woman walks over, grabbing a bowl of soup on her way.
Months pass while Suru is under her care. He wakes up, eats, farms, eats and sleeps, over and over. The day is stormy, Suru and the old woman are sitting inside. People inside the village start screaming and running, A massive ship has landed on shore. The men slaughter the village. Suru runs out, clutching his blade. He sees his target, his fathers murderer. He’s only 100 feet away now. He’s closing in. The captain looks back at him and laughs. The captain draws his broadsword. Suru closes in on him, getting closer and closer. The captain raises his sword ready to swing. Suru jumps at him with the intent to kill. The captain swings down his sword, the sword slices into his back, slamming him into the ground. He lays on the ground unconscious, bleeding from his back.
“Heh. Kids.” Nadeslos snickers.
Suru grabs his ankle and cuts his achilles tendon. Nadeslos screams in pain as he falls to the ground, his smirk gone now. Suru stands up and punches Nadeslos jaw, he falls to the ground, clutching his jaw. Suru stands over him, his dagger above his head ready to kill. He can’t do it. An archer shoots Suru in the back, he falls to his knees. The dagger falls from his hands and cuts the back of Nadeslos neck, killing him slowly as he bleeds out, gasping for life. His gasps are curdled by blood as it flows from his mouth. Another arrow shoots into Suru’s back, and then another.
“F-father… will I see you… in Valhalla?” Suru mutters as he breathes his last breath.
Suru collapses on the green grass, his blood saturates the soil. Death finally takes Suru to his mother and father."
"A dying empire: a small rudder, a tall ship",HFY,1i4f8ez,2025-01-18 14:27:52,29,0.97,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i4f8ez/a_dying_empire_a_small_rudder_a_tall_ship/,Feeling_Glovely,OC,"The plasma churn of the engine burned a bright blue as Esten stood before the open hatch. Lifting the body of an Orcish child, draped in white linen, with one of the garish books tucked into its arms. Esten spoke in the guttural language he had done his best to learn, doing all within his power to keep within the customs of the people.

“Gortan’mag daughter of Bornal and Fluer. I deliver you to your ancestors in the stars, your body broken down and your essence spread into the depths of the void that they may embrace you.” he said as he dropped the body into the churning blue plasma below, watching as it quickly churned, bubbled, and consumed the flesh, releasing the energy contained within the matter as heat.

He had spent most of his days this way since arriving at the imperial seat with the captured orcish ship, first on learning the customs of burial, then doing his best to follow them to the letter. He had learned each of their names, found well worn items in their quarters to send them to the stars with. The task was monumental at first, but one he needed to do it, he had barely even slept in the last 8 days as he laid each of them to rest, with silent prayers that there souls may be at peace. And yet somehow he never once turned his prayers to his own soul, never once begging the gods to forgive him for what he had done.

“Is that the last one then?” Fate’s voice drew him from his thoughts, the words evidence of her concern for the man. Esten sighed as he closed the hatch to the churning plasma that powered the engine.

“It is.” he said, a quiet thing, almost a whisper as if he hadn't even spoken.

“It was a good thing you did, honoring them like this.” she said with a soft kindness, stepping closer to him and laying a hand on his shoulder.

“We used to be allies.” he changed the subject quickly, “turns out historically all coalition and humanity all worked together to venture across the verse. Shared technology and knowledge.” he sighed.

“What happened?” she asked, he glanced at her with an annoyed look in his eye, he had filed a full report on the information, one he knew she had read. “Humor me.” she said calmly, walking out of the engine room and down the hall. Esten began to follow as he talked.

“There was a virus, a strange thing, it wiped out 95 percent of the human population a few thousand years ago, killed off most of the dwarves, and halflings, and as far as we know all of the gnomes.” he spoke as they made their way down the hall and into a galley, before he knew it sitting at a table with tankards of mead and plates of food before them.

“The issue came before the final collapse of the major societies, it was discovered that the virus had effects of Orcish cognitive abilities, and that the elves were immune, as such the story of the orcs being brutes came into being, and the idea that the elves were out to destroy us.” Esten sighed as he sat down and began to hungrily shovel the food into his mouth, his body practically moving on his own. “The only humans who survived were scattered at first, and when they came together most of our infrastructure for education or the like was gone. and that was just the start of the trouble.”

“Right” Fate said taking a bite of her own food. “A populous demagogue blamed the non human races and made himself emperor.” she said with something like disdain.

“Emperor Victor the first, almost two full millenia ago.” Esten said with a sigh. “I doubt there's even an elf alive who would remember the cause of this blood war with their own eyes.” he drank deeply of the mead, for a moment all his troubles and horrors forgotten.

“Perhaps that will work in our favor,” Fate mused for a moment, “after all if we make contact perhaps we can explain that this was all unknown to us and try to make amends.”

Esten scoffed. “Yeah I'm sure that’ll work ‘our bad on all the war crimes y’all, we thought you were dumb and so it was okay.” the mocking tone in his voice drawing a glare from Fate.

“You know what I mean, Sage.” She huffed, crossing her arms across her chest with annoyance. “Negotiations and peace talks that will lead to a peaceful alliance in the future.”

“I know.” Esten said, dropping his eyes to stare into the mead in his tankard. “I just fear humanity may have to be broken again in order to rebuild.” 

The sound of heavy footsteps approaching drew both their eyes to the door, seeing Bear come to it, the massive man ducking and squeezing to push though into the galley. “There ye are.” he said with a kind smile. “The burials all complete?”

Esten nodded solemnly. 

“Good, I hope it's helped ye lay some of yer demons to rest.” the man said “we gatta talk to the houses, berry thinks yer dealing with the church ell help with Medichi.”

Esten grunted as his stomach turned over in his body, there had never been a pope who had not come from the Medici,  though they were far from devout followers of the Church's doctrine. Rather using the church to extend their sphere of influence as far as they could and grow their wealth, they weren't even in line for the throne, but were considered on par with the emperor himself in terms of political power.

“Who do you have?” Fate's words drew Esten from his thoughts as her eyes met Bear’s.

“Scutum.” the confusion on the faces of Fate and Esten causing him to continue. “Not a Bishop or Deacon in the force aint part o them. Through blood, marriage or adoption.” the mans thick accent dripping off each of the words. “Joke stands that if ye make Deacon without their help they issue ye a Scutum spouse.”

All three laughed slightly at the joke, “I suppose I never dealt with many officers outside of the Black Dawn.” Esten said with a shrug. “Never realized they were so connected to the marines.”

“The Black Dawn makes the rest of the regiments nervous,” Fate said with a soft, sincere smile, shrugging her shoulders softly. “But then again i can't blame them, your the ones who put them in dishonorable graves should they deserve it.”

“Aye the Red Mountain may as well be a different regiment when yer around it lad. Hell only the indigo snakes dunna seem te change, but they spect yer kill em anyway.” Bear laughed, drawing a soft smile from Esten, the first in the many days since he had captured this ship and shattered history as he had known it.

“So we try to persuade these noble houses to support the emperor in ending the war?” Esten asked.

“No.” Specter's voice cut in as the man materialized into view just beyond the door. “Reports from the front show inflated losses, and the emperor has established a tax to support the war effort that affects the nobles most heavily, and due to needed increases in production they can't just pull it from the serfs on their lands. Or rather if they do it'll result in open rebellion.” the man spoke calmly, sauntering over to the table, his long hooded black jacket hanging off his body more tatters than armor at this point. He reached down with his knife and speared a piece of fruit, bringing it to his lips hungrily.

“So were to make them think stopping the war is their own idea.” Esten said with a soft smile as he watched the three others nod. “Well then I suppose I should go see the Medici.” he rose from the table quickly, only to find spectors hand on his chest shoving him back into the chair.

“You smell like a herbalist who's been trying to invent a better fertilizer by scrubbing himself in manure for a week.” the man said harshly. “And you look even worse. Go to your quarters, get some rest, and for the sake of the gods bathe yourself.” 

Esten paused, thinking to protest, before nodding calmly, and standing to make his way out of the ships galley and down to where the airlock connected to the imperial seat, he waved his hand in front of it and it slid open, the two imperial guards in there intricate red metal armor snapped to attention, pulling their crossed halberds out of the way of the door to let Esten pass.

“Looks like you had a hard fought battle my lord Sage.” the ranking guard on the left said. A lance corporal by the look of him.

“Harder than you can imagine, son.” Esten said calmly, the words falling off his tongue with the weight of his despair. “And it's only just beginning.”

He walked quickly though the palace, for once not stopping to stare though the great glass ceiling at the stars hovering all around, or to take in the beauty of the planets below. He paid no mind to the bustle of the city that made up the space station, dodging food carts, and taverns, and offers for company from various courtesans who walked the streets, he made his way towards the seat of power, slipping through a hidden door near the emperor's throne room and walking down the hall that held the quarters of each of the hands. 

He placed his palm on the lock of his own door when he reached it. Already stripping his sleek black armor from his body. The undersuit clinging to him, making a sickly ripping sound as he forced it away from his skin. He stepped through a door in the wall as it made a soft whoosh, the undersuit of the armor only half removed as he struck a button on the wall and water began to poor down from the ceiling in a thick torrent, letting it pour over him as he wrenched the rest of the suit from his body. He held his face into the water as it began to heat, cascading down on his face and over his skin in waves as he scrubbed his hands hard against himself as if somehow scrubbing his skin raw may wash away the blood that stained him.

He knew it wouldn't, but there was something in his head that wouldn't let him stop. It wasn't a rational, or even conscious thought. Until a moment later when there was no conscious thought at all, as he ended the flow of water, and walked back into his room, the water dripping off his skin as he collapsed onto his bunk and faded into blackness.

He awoke sometime later, the flashing behind his right eye clearer than normal. “System reboot complete, time elapsed 11 hours.”

“That's odd.” Esten said to himself, still staring at the message behind closed eyes.

“What's odd love?” the voice startled him and he wrenched his eyes open, a beautiful tan woman about 45 winters old with long black hair, grey streaks running through it sat on the end of his bed. Despite her age she still maintained her muscular figure. She gasped. “Sage what happened to your eye.” she said, reaching out a hand. 

Esten couldn't help but notice she was dressed in fine lacy purple lingerie, and he didn't feel an excitement to see her. It's not that he wasn’t happy to, that he didn't enjoy her presence, it's just somehow it was dulled. As if the feeling was through a fog in the distance.

He lingered on the thought for a moment as her hand traced along the side of his face. “What do you mean? Nothing happened to my eye.” he said, his voice still half cloaked in sleep but still confused.

“It's nearly white.” she said he voice a gasp of fear, “they told me you were uninjured, but this looks like it did when you burnt it on the hydraulic fluid of my armor right after you woke from the trail of relics.”

Esten smiled, sitting up and looking the woman deep in the eyes. “It's good to see you tan.” he said with a soft, kind smile. It was good to see her, but still the fog seemed to persist over his emotions.

She swatted him playfully on the chest. “It's good to see you? Six fucking years youve been on mission and all i get is an its good to see you?” she grabbed him and pulled him into a deep kiss. “Oh you're gonna make these last six years up to me right now.”

Esten woke to the beeping of the morning bells, his arms wrapped around the muscular woman who lay beside him, slumbering deeply. He pushed her hair from her face and kissed her softly on the cheek, before he rose from the bed and opened his closet, removing his black kevlar dress uniform. The black trousers tucked into fine leather boots, polished so bright you could almost see yourself in them. A simple black tunic and then the high collared jacket, pulled tight with its two rows of shining silver buttons on the front. He slid his under arm holster over his back, placing his pistols on each side before linking his sword to his back. And finally the black woolen beret, the crossed key seal of the emperor in shining gold stitching placed to sit directly over his left eye.

“What are you getting all dressed up for?” Tessisent said sleepily, rousing in the bed, letting the covers fall slightly off her breasts.

“I must go see the Medici.” he responded with a sigh, hesitating before he moved to turn around.

He felt the woman press against his back, her arms wrapping around him and hugging him tightly. “What happened, Sage?” she asked softly. “Bear said it was bad, but that's all he would tell me.”

“I fear i can say no more my dear, this is a burden i dare not share with you.” Esten spoke softly, each word chosen carefully. “I fear i've grown hollow from carrying it just the last few days, and I cannot place that pain upon you.”

He felt her arms squeeze him tight, they had seen Marines grow hollow before, some who couldn't handle the battles and lost their minds, others who lost their humanity. He knew she felt the weight of what he had said, even though he had told her so little. That what he had learned on the orc ship he had captured had rewritten him to his very core. The man who used to inhabit his body was gone, he was just a ghost of himself now.

“But don’t worry,” he said, turning towards her and smiling. Lifting her chin to look him in the eyes. “Even through the fog you still burn brighter than any supernova.”

She laughed, blinking away her tears and smacked him on the chest playfully. “Well good, because you only made a start in making the last six years up to me last night.” she said, planting a kiss on his lips. “Go and do your politicking, and i will see you this evening.”

Esten turned and walked out the door, one feeling clear though the fog, hope.

Parents made fun of me constantly during childhood,emotionalneglect,1i2n5wu,2025-01-16 06:47:54,314,1.0,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1i2n5wu/parents_made_fun_of_me_constantly_during_childhood/,Fairycupcake814,,"I’m sure this has been discussed many times here, but I’m really trying to process this. I was teased and mocked by my parents every single day, going back to a very young age. If I had an interest/hobby, they laughed at it. The way I spoke, the way I wore my hair, the way I dressed, my body type, the foods I ate — all a joke to them. If I had serious questions or thoughts about things, they belittled me. They had negative things to say about all of my friends and made fun of them behind their backs, too. Instead of teaching me about hygiene they just made fun of me throughout puberty for any bodily changes I went through. Often times I felt that I had to “go along with the joke” because my dad was so thin skinned that he would curse at me for not having a sense of humor. I remember being called a b1 tch when I was around 9 or 10 for telling him to stop making fun of me. My mother would say in a cruel, mocking tone “you’re too sensitive, we’re just TeASinG you!!” As I got into my teens and twenties, my dad recognized that saying women were “wh0 res” made me mad so he did it constantly, in every conversation, hundreds of times a day. Then he laughed about how much it pissed me off.

I realize now that they had zero emotional depth and were absolutely incapable of having any kind of relationship. They spoke to their parents and coworkers the same way and neither of them had a single friend, ever. I remember one time my father rolling down the window as we drove past a neighbor’s house and him loudly making fun of the neighbor. The neighbor looked pissed. I told him to stop and he threw a fit, stating that I was an ignorant child and he was a grown man that knew how to talk to people. 

My parents didn’t teach me a single life skill, but I think this was their biggest failing. They simply could not model how to be respectful, normal people. I grew up thinking that it was necessary to mock and belittle others. I did not know how to solve a conflict. I also developed a deep sense of self hatred and was extremely insecure. I truly believed that I was ugly, untalented, annoying, unlovable, etc because I had been made fun of my entire life. This eventually led to disordered eating, alcohol abvse, abvsive boyfriends, etc. I’m living a much better life now and I have kids of my own. I have never found a single reason to mock them. I have no desire to hurt their feelings. I build them up and complement them and admire them. It feels like a very easy thing to do, it’s so natural. I will never understand my parents. "

***A Short Story by R.C.Jr***



The country of the Philippines has boasted a wealth of stunning natural wonders and a myriad of hunting stories, from vaguely supernatural to downright spine-chilling. 

In the past, a street in Meto Manila’s biggest city, Quezon (ke-zon), has hosted such hunting and scary tales. A particular street, Balete Drive, was named after an endemic tree, “Balete,” pronounced as ba-le-te, and has been the subject of numerous paranormal reports and investigations. 

The balete trees have been thought in many areas of the country to be dwelling places for supernatural beings or engkantos-like fayes, kapre (kap-re)– a tall, muscular man smoking a huge tobacco, or tikbalang (tik-ba-lang), a half-human, half-horse humanoid. 

The Balete Drive used to be lined with rows of balete trees casting eerie shadows on the infamous road. Motorists of different walks of life would recount their tales of spooky encounters on at least one of their many trips along the fabled street of Balete Drive.

The following story was recounted to me by an old acquaintance of my father. A once fellow cab driver who used to transport people to other parts of the metro while going through the infamous Balete Drive more times than he could remember.

The man is now retired and has visited my father on an invitation to his sixty-fifth birthday. The celebration went as well as anyone could have hoped for. Families and friends that have long been separated apart were reunited. Food and drinks were aplenty, and the famous Filipino Karaoke blasted through the air.

It was thirty minutes past nine in the evening when the celebration started slowing down. One by one, guests bade my father farewell with promises that they’d be there on his next birthday. One of the guests, the old cab driver, had to stay at our place as it would be too difficult for him to go home that late. The man currently lives in a town in Laguna, a nearby province from Metro Manila and a hundred miles away from our residence in Quezon City.

We asked him to stay the night at our home for his own safety and convenience. After a series of overly dramatic convincing from my father, the man relented and decided to stay. I promised him I would drive him to the bus terminal to Laguna first thing in the morning.

It was past eleven in the evening when all the guests except for some family members and the old man had left. The celebration, however, did not entirely end, as my father, the old man, and I decided to sit at a table and pour ourselves more liquor. 

The two old timers’ conversation mostly circled around their time as fellow cab drivers working under the same cab operator. Occasionally, both men would reminisce on their exes and how they once shared the same girlfriend without them knowing until the same lady got pregnant by another cab driver from a different city.

As a thirty-one-year-old working man, it was a pleasure to see both my father and his friend reminisce about their past. As inexperienced as I was at that point in my life, I did little to contribute to the conversation. For the most part, I was there as a listener, a passenger on the two old men’s trip down memory lane. 

The conversation and drinking between all three of us lasted until past midnight. I was about to announce to my old drinking buddies that it was time to call it a night when suddenly, the old man told me to wait as he would like to tell a story he just remembered while reminiscing their past. 

My father sat straight up, seemingly taken out of his drunken stupor upon hearing his friend’s words. 

“What? You’re going to tell us that story again?” My father, in his drunken state, asked. 

“Yeah… I know I’ve told you this many times before, but your son hasn’t heard it yet.” The old man said in response. 

“Besides, what better way to end the night than with a good old scary story, eh?” The man added, accompanied by a chuckle.

“Alright, well, just so you know, my son here is easily spooked. Furthermore, he regularly drives through that same road where you said your encounters took place.”  My father jested, aiming to take a jab at my reluctance to listen to scary stories, especially ones about the infamous street that I knew my father was referring to. 

“Nahh..look at your son. He’s a grown-up. I’m sure he can take a few scary stories before bedtime tonight. Can you, son?” The old man uttered as his face turned towards me. 

“Yes, I sure can. I don’t mind a scary story before ending the night.” I confidently remarked. I didn’t know what to expect then, but I could tell then and there that it would be an interesting story. 

The old man fixed himself up, trying to shake off some of the alcohol in his system from a long night of drinking. 

“Alright, then. Here’s my story. A true life experience when I was still young, in the mid-70s, and I was in my mid-thirties if I remember correctly, and was still driving a cab with your father.” His face once again turned in my direction. 

“This was when I encountered something I thought only existed in horror movies or novels. An encounter which, at that time, I seriously thought would be the end of me.” The man recounted, now audibly, with a more somber tone. 

The old man’s name was Rico, and this was his story:

It was close to midnight when Rico, driving a cab assigned to him by his operator, found himself driving along the desolate stretch of Balete Drive. The streetlights flickered, casting eerie shadows from the towering balete trees that lined the road. Rico hated taking this route due to its infamy, not only due to alleged hunting but mainly due to the street’s poor lighting, mostly obscured by the tall balete trees.

The area was known to be accident-prone, and tragedies involving all sorts of motorists are reported almost monthly. His last passenger had insisted it was the quickest way to her destination. A young lady dressed in a bright red gown trying to get to a college prom held at a convention center within the nearby University of the Philippines campus.

Rico dropped his passenger off at the main gate of the convention hall and contemplated going back the same way he came, as doing so would allow for the shortest time to exit Balete Drive. Then, he remembered the time. It was fifteen past ten, and he was supposed to be at home by eleven. 

While his operating hours typically lasted until the wee hours, he wanted to get home early and get to bed the rest of the night. He needed to wake up early the following morning as he was contracted to drive a neighbor who was going abroad to the Middle East to an international airport in Pasay City, Manila.

This basically means that going back to the portion of the street where he entered would require him to take a longer route back home. The alternative was to take the rest of Balete Drive, exiting at a main highway leading up to his residence in Caloocan (ka-lo-o-can). While very unappealing, this option would cut his travel time by about half an hour.

After much contemplation, Rico decided to continue traversing Balete Drive. 

“If I just focus my attention on the road and don’t think of the stories, I should be able to exit the street in no time,” Rico said to himself, trying to suppress his apprehension. 

“Besides, those are just stories. Urban tales shared among friends on a drinking binge.” He added. And so, Rico went on to take the remaining distance out of Balete Drive.

The night was dark, and the moon hung low in the sky, casting a pale light over the road. The only sound was the engine's hum and the occasional rustle of leaves. Rico glanced at the clock. It was late, and he was still far from home. He turned up the radio, hoping some music would ease his tension, but the signal was weak. Only static filled the air, adding to the eerie atmosphere.   
  
Rico focused on the road ahead. “Just a few more kilometers,” he thought. 

However, the darkness seemed to stretch endlessly. Each turn brought unexpected bumps and shadows. He tried to keep his mind on the driving, but strange shapes flickered at the edge of his vision.

“Just my imagination,” he muttered to himself. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something watched him. 

Every so often, he’d catch a glimpse of movement in the trees. A stray dog? A cat? Or perhaps some college students that were up to no good? Rico shook his head, trying to dispel the creeping unease.

As he turned onto a curve suddenly, his headlights caught something. On the side of the road stood a figure—a woman in a white dress, her hair long and tangled. She looked lost and afraid. Rico’s heart raced. 

“Should I help her? ” he thought. But the road was dark, and his instincts told him to keep driving.

Rico hesitated but eventually slowed down. A potential passenger this late at night was rare, and fares had been scarce all day.

“Where to, ma’am?” Rico asked, rolling down the window slightly.

The woman didn’t respond. She simply opened the back door and slid into the seat behind him. Her movements were slow and deliberate, and Rico couldn’t help but notice how cold the air suddenly felt.

“Balintawak (ba-lin-ta-wak),” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Rico nodded and began driving, trying to ignore the strange chill creeping up his spine. The road was eerily quiet, save for the hum of his engine. He glanced in the rearview mirror, hoping to catch a clearer look at his passenger. 

  
“Where exactly in Balintawak would you like me to take you, miss? ” he asked, but she only stared ahead. 

The road twisted and turned beneath him, and the night seemed to grow darker. Rico’s mind raced. Was this a good decision? Should he have driven away?

Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw something alarming in the mirror—behind them, the shadows seemed to grow larger and darker, and an unshakable feeling of dread washed over him. He pressed the gas pedal, desperate to escape the growing fear. 

Rico’s heart is now racing. A million thoughts ran through his mind. The lady in white still hadn’t spoken a word since providing her destination. At this point, Rico decided to look in the rearview mirror to check on the woman in the backseat of the cab once again, but what he saw froze him.

The woman’s face was a blank void—no eyes, no nose, no mouth. Just an empty, pale surface where her features should have been.

Panic gripped him. He tried to focus on the road, but the rearview mirror seemed to pull his gaze back. The woman’s head was now tilted slightly as if she were staring directly at him, though she had no eyes to do so.

Rico slammed on the brakes, his heart pounding. “Ma’am, please, you need to get out!” he shouted, his voice trembling.

The woman didn’t move. Instead, she leaned forward, and he felt her cold breath against his ear.

“Why are you afraid?” she whispered. “You picked me up, didn’t you?”

The woman’s words were accompanied by a chilling mist that penetrated through Rico’s body. This was his breaking point. He stopped the cab right in the middle of the road and turned to the woman in the backseat, wanting to tell his passenger to get out of the vehicle right away.

But, as he turns, the woman vanishes from the car, nowhere to be found. Rico was at a loss for words. Was he just imagining things? Was there really a woman a few minutes ago inside the vehicle? “Am I finally losing it?” Was Rico’s final thought. 

With the woman no longer inside the vehicle, Rico started the vehicle’s engine again and continued to drive down the empty road. His knuckles turned white while tightly gripping the steering wheel. 

He glanced at the vehicle’s speedometer, which was clocking in more than a hundred kilometers per hour, twice the road’s speed limit of no more than fifty kilometers. 

Rico couldn’t care less at that point, as his only thoughts were to get out of the accursed Balete Drive as soon as possible. Then, after a few minutes of driving at a dangerous speed, Rico realized something. 

“Where the heck is the exit? Was Rico’s initial thought. 

“This road seems never to end. I’ve driven through this same road during the day, and I don’t remember the road being this long.” Rico added, muttering to himself desperately attempting to make sense of what was happening.

He glanced at the clock; time passed, yet he hadn’t reached the exit. Almost an hour had passed, and Rico was still driving along Balete Drive. 

“This can’t be real.” Rico once again muttered to himself. “Soon, I’ll run out of gas. There’s no way I’m stopping along this road. I’ll stay inside the car and spend the rest of the night if I have to.” This was Rico’s feeble attempt at a plan should he run out of gas while trying to exit Balete Drive. 

After more than an hour had passed, Rico saw what appeared to be light in the distance, a small light flickering through his windshield. Hope surged through him. He sped towards it, hoping that he was finally nearing the exit. But as he got closer, the light vanished, leaving only darkness behind. 

Rico looked around. The trees now seemed to close in on him, and he felt trapped. “Please, what the heck is going on? ” he asked to nobody, his voice trembling.

Rico was growing desperate and more terrified at that point. Terrified that he may never be able to reach the exit.

“Am I dead? Did the woman earlier actually end my life, and now I’m just another ghost driving along this forsaken road on an endless journey to escape? Is this the afterlife? Am I in limbo?” A series of thoughts flooded Rico’s mind, with each one drawing him closer to a somber but likely conclusion. 

In Rico’s mind, he might as well no longer be in the world of the living as there was no making sense of the events that had unfolded. Another half an hour passed, and Rico was getting tired of the endless driving. He was so tired that he even considered stopping in the middle of the road and accepting his fate. 

“No! I’m not going down without a fight! I still have my hunting knife tucked in under my seat.” This was Rico’s last flicker of resolve while checking out for the hunting knife that was gifted to him by a friend in the army.  

The hunting knife has given Rico the confidence to fight off any potential robbers during his night shift. That same knife was giving him hope to, at the very least, have something to fight whatever malevolent entity that had been causing him such torment.

A few more minutes had passed when suddenly, his headlights caught something. He hit the brakes. Now, standing in the middle of the road was the same woman in a white dress, her hair long and tangled. 

“Oh, shi-!” It’s that woman again!” Rico exclaimed as he hit the gas and tried to drive around the woman. 

Just as he was about to pass her, the woman instantly vanished in thin air. Rico, however, did not stop driving. 

He was not picking up the same scary lady this time. Rico continued to drive. The road was now getting even narrower, with a steep drop on one side. He pressed on, his knuckles whiter than ever.   
  
The figure appeared again at several more turns, always maintaining the same distance. Rico’s hands trembled as he struggled to maintain control of the car.

The road was becoming increasingly treacherous, with potholes and loose gravel making driving a challenge. His heart pounded in his chest, and beads of sweat trickled down his temples. 

Rico does not remember the road being this rough. The road, in fact, was among the most well-maintained, as it services motorists going in and out of the nearby university. 

This mattered very little to Rico. In his mind, he might as well have veered off course, ending up in a remote, secluded road that may very well lead to his eventual demise. Rico, however, kept driving.

Not a moment had passed when Rico suddenly felt an all too familiar sensation. The sensation that someone was with him in the vehicle. The atmosphere inside the vehicle almost instantly turned chilly, accompanied by a subtle but audible breathing in the backseat of the taxi. 

“You’re here again, aren’t you?” Rico remarked with a now surprisingly braver tone. 

The events leading up to that point have exhausted Rico of all his fears. He somewhat became desensitized to the woman’s presence inside the vehicle, and he had long come to an understanding that if this was going to be his end, then so be it. 

But Rico intended to fight back, whether it be using his knife or any means that would at the very least give him comfort that he went down like a man, fighting.

“I… I just want to go to my family..” Came a chilling voice from the back. “Will… you take me there… mister?” Added by the woman in the back. 

“Where, to Balintawak?” Rico calmly responded, trying to sound as casual as possible. 

“Ye… yesss… Balintawak.” Responded the woman in affirmation.

“Alright, alright. I can take you there.” Answered Rico. 

“But you see, you have to pay a fare for me to take you wherever it is you want to go,” Rico added while now displaying his usual self as a taxi driver. There was no response from the woman in the back, however. 

“You see here, this is what we call a taxi meter.” Rico continued speaking while tapping on the taxi meter. Still, there was no response from the passenger. 

“This thing clocks in the distance we’ve traveled and calculates how much it’ll cost.” Rico went on to elaborate without paying any mind to his passenger’s silence. 

“From my estimate, the total fare from here to Balintawak should cost you around five hundred peso-“ Rico’s sentence was cut short by a new development inside the vehicle. 

The woman, who had been silent the whole time Rico was talking, all of a sudden grabbed Rico’s right hand with a grip so tight that it almost restricted blood flow to the rest of Rico’s arm. The woman’s unexpected move caused panic in Rico, shattering his initial façade of calmness and fearlessness. 

The man frantically tried to shake his right hand off of the woman’s vice grip to no avail. The woman’s hand felt ice cold, so cold that it delivered a level of pain to Rico’s entire body that he never knew he would get to feel. 

“Get off me, you wretched!” Rico commanded while trying to steer the vehicle from going off the road with his left hand.

The woman, however, did not relent in her assault and finally blared in Rico’s ear the words: “TAKE… ME… TO… BALINTAWAK..!” 

The words were so loud that Rico could feel his eardrums shattering and the vehicle’s glass windows and windshield vibrating, about to break in any second. 

Rico instinctively reached out for the hunting knife tucked safely underneath the driver’s seat with his left hand, momentarily letting go of the steering wheel. He effortlessly unsheathed the knife from its scabbard and, with all his might, stabbed the woman by the hand that was taking hold of his right arm. 

The knife, however, failed even to penetrate the woman’s skin. The knife would seemingly bounce off the woman’s arm with every stab that Rico attempted. 

Rico, seeing that his attacks didn’t work on the woman’s arm, aimed to stab his attacker in the face. The car, at this point, has been swerving left to right with Rico’s remaining free hand alternating between attacking the woman and manning the steering wheel. 

Rico positioned the knife to point what he assumed was the direction of the woman’s face. With the remaining strength he could muster, Rico took one full swing with the knife in his left hand at his attacker’s face. The almost ninety-degree left hook landed its intended target, the woman’s face. 

While Rico could not exactly tell where the tip of the knife landed, he surmised that it was somewhere on the lower left eye of the woman. To his horror, however, even the long-winded attack did no damage to the woman in the back. 

The woman did not budge and continued her vice grip on Rico’s right arm while wailing the same words as before: “TAKE… ME… TO… BALINTAWAK..!”

At that moment, Rico realizes the woman isn't simply a ghost; she's a malevolent entity feeding on his fear, slowly draining his life force with every second the cold, bony hand clutches into his. 

Left with no other choice, Rico turned to other means he knew could potentially ward off ghosts, ghouls, evil spirits, and anything that comes bumping into the night: Prayer.

Up until that point, Rico never considered himself a religious person. Although born and raised as a Roman Catholic, he rarely attends church or mass. 

He would only do so during his birthdays and Christmas Eve mass and if his devoutly  Catholic parents would drag him to attend Sunday mass each time they visited him from the province. 

While growing up in the province, Rico spent all four of his high school years at a Catholic school. During all those years, he learned to memorize common prayers, the names of several saints, and other religious invocations that surprisingly stayed with him even now that he was in his early thirties. 

Not being able to make the Sign of the Cross using his right hand, he did it with his left. This time, Rico decided to fight the entity not with physical force, which proves useless against the ethereal being, but with his will, invoking religious symbols, prayers, and anything to repel the malevolent spirit. 

Rico cried out to the Heavens for protection, for salvation. He called out all the names of the saints he knew, promised to attend every Sunday mass for the rest of his life, and ultimately made a promise to become a changed man should he survive the terrifying ordeal.

The struggle becomes a terrifying battle of wills, a fight for his sanity and his life, as the eyeless woman in white relentlessly tries to pull him into the darkness. 

The woman, however, is undeterred, and the car becomes a battleground between the driver’s unyielding faith and a demon eager to claim its next victim.

In a race against time, Rico doubles down on reciting prayers from his childhood, testing his faith and courage as the woman now seemingly tries to take control of the taxi, steering it towards a ditch in the side of the road. 

Desperate and determined, Rico draws on the power of his prayers, invoking ancient verses that resonate with divine strength. The woman, who now resembles more of a demonic entity, roars in fury, but Rico’s unwavering faith begins to weaken its hold. 

With a final, resounding prayer, Rico confronts the demon head-on, channeling all his hope and courage into one last plea for deliverance. 

And, when the tussle between Rico and the now demon-looking woman seemed never to end, a saving grace unexpectedly came. A beam of light from a semi’s headlight illuminated the vehicle. The instant illumination momentarily distracted Rico from his ordeal. 

For a moment, time seemed to freeze. Rico could not believe what he was seeing. A truck driven by a live human being. Even with just a second, Rico could see the male driver of the semi with his bull cap on.

At this point, Rico did not even notice that his taxi had ceased to move. He somehow managed to hit the brakes amidst the chaos and halted the vehicle to a full stop on his side of the road. 

Then, in only a matter of a few seconds, his awareness returned to the tribulation at hand. The demonic-looking woman, however, is gone. The woman somehow disappeared when the semi truck’s light hit the vehicle. 

Rico, not wanting to let his guard down and not fully believing that his torment was finally over, spun around the vehicle, trying to find any trace of the woman in a white dress. 

Finally, after what felt like hours of thoroughly checking the vehicle and the surroundings, Rico leaned back in the driver’s seat and exhaled a deep sigh of relief. 

Rico’s heart was still pounding at an exhilarated speed, and the pain in his right arm from the woman’s grip still persisted, but Rico knew that this time, he was saved. 

He took another few minutes to catch his abated breath before starting the ignition, and with visibly shaking hands, grabbed the steering wheel and continued to drive along Balete Drive.

Not long after, a green metal sign perched atop a metal pole had the sign that read, “You are now exiting Balete Drive.” Rico almost broke into tears upon reading the sign. 

“I made it! I survived!” Rico exhaled to himself with clenched fists, pounding the steering wheel for a triumphant victory over a terrifying ordeal. 

Rico made it home at two in the morning. He did not get any sleep and ended up fetching his neighbor an hour earlier than agreed. 

The neighbor did not mind the early transport to the international airport, though, as it would give them ample time to sort out everything for their travel abroad.

The ordeal left a deep mark on Rico’s life. He actively avoids Balete Drive during his shift, and if the situation really needs him to, he makes sure to drive along the road during the day. 

Rico also fulfilled the promises he made during his encounter at Balete Drive. He attended Sunday mass as much as he could and even became a layman later on after retiring from his job as a taxi driver. Nowadays, Rico enjoys the retired life with his family at his residence in Laguna. 

“Well, what can you say, kid? Was that a great, scary story I just told?” Recto went on to ask while gently slapping my left arm. 

“Yeah, it was a cool story. I’m glad you made it out alive!” I responded with an audible chuckle, signaling that while I enjoyed the story, I was unsure of its authenticity. 

Rico caught on to my sarcasm and showed me his right arm. “Tell me, son, what do you see?” Rico asked. 

I looked at him, unsure of what he wanted me to see, but I subsequently turned to the old man’s right arm while squinting my eyes. 

The old man’s skin has turned dull and wrinkled due to his advanced age, but upon careful inspection, I swear I could see a print, a hand print that, although subtle, had a clear outline of human fingers attached to a palm. 

“Is that what I think it is?” Was all I could say after making out a handprint on the old man’s right arm. 

“Yes, kid, it is exactly what you think it is,” Rico responded in affirmation and with a chuckle. 

I could only look at the old man with apparent disbelief at that point. “Are… are we done?” 

Our conversation was interrupted by my father, who had just woken from a nap. Unbeknownst to us, my old man fell asleep shortly after Rico started recounting his experience. 

My father had already heard the same story from his friend more times than he could count, and he would not surely mind not hearing it another time. 

“Yeah, I think we’re done here. I’m already way past my bedtime as it is.” Rico jested with an audible laughter. 

The two old men went to bed at around one in the morning. Rico’s recounting of the story lasted for almost an hour. I stayed awake for a few minutes in order to clean the table where we had our little soiree. 

The next morning, I made good on my promise and drove Rico to the bus station with buses that would take him home to Laguna. In tow was my father riding shotgun. 

After telling his scary story, Rico and I had somewhat developed a bond and he requested to be seated in the passenger seat next to me. Along the way, the old man and my father continued their conversation, reminiscing about the past. Rico occasionally spills out silly secrets from my father’s past life, all in good fun.

After forty-five minutes of driving, we arrived at the bus station. All three of us exited my car, and Rico, sporting a huge smile on his face, hugged me and my father and promised to return the following year. 

We finally bade Rico goodbye, and my father and I drove back home shortly after. 

Every now and then, I remember Rico’s story about his encounter with a malevolent entity and the long, empty, unending road. I would contemplate whether to believe the old man’s story was true each time. 

While Rico’s story may be just one of the many fabricated tales and creepy stories about the infamous road, I could also tell that the old man was not lying when he recounted his experience. 

While ultimately, I cannot say that I believe his story, on the other hand, I believe that the old man fully believes that his encounter was real. I would always be reminded of the old man’s story every time I happened to drive by the same road. I may not admit it, but as a precaution, I avoided driving through the road late at night. 

This concludes one of the many tales surrounding the infamous street along Quezon City. This is James, and this is the end of the story of Rico, the taxi, and the Woman in White of Balete Drive.

# A Short Story by R.C.Jr



The country of the Philippines has boasted a wealth of stunning natural wonders and a myriad of hunting stories, from vaguely supernatural to downright spine-chilling. 

In the past, a street in Meto Manila’s biggest city, Quezon (ke-zon), has hosted such hunting and scary tales. A particular street, Balete Drive, was named after an endemic tree, “Balete,” pronounced as ba-le-te, and has been the subject of numerous paranormal reports and investigations. 

The balete trees have been thought in many areas of the country to be dwelling places for supernatural beings or engkantos-like fayes, kapre (kap-re)– a tall, muscular man smoking a huge tobacco, or tikbalang *(tik-ba-lang)*, a half-human, half-horse humanoid. In some places, sorcery rituals are known to be performed inside the chambers formed by the tree. Also, among others, some superstitious folks suggest not bringing in balete as decorative plants inside a house as they allegedly invite ghosts.

In the past, Balete Drive, an undivided two-lane street and the main thoroughfare of New Manila, Quezon City, was lined with large balete trees that darkened the area considerably and made it appear ""frightening"" to some Manila residents. 

The following story was recounted to me by an old acquaintance of my father. A once fellow cab driver who used to transport people to other parts of the metro while going through the infamous Balete Drive more times than he could remember.

The man is now retired and has visited my father on an invitation to his sixty-fifth birthday. The celebration went as well as anyone could have hoped for. Families and friends that have long been separated apart were reunited. Food and drinks were aplenty, and the famous Filipino Karaoke blasted through the air.

It was thirty minutes past nine in the evening when the celebration started slowing down. One by one, guests bade my father farewell with promises that they’d be there on his next birthday. One of the guests, the old cab driver, had to stay at our place as it would be too difficult for him to go home that late. The man currently lives in a town in Laguna, a nearby province from Metro Manila and a hundred miles away from our residence in Quezon City.

We asked him to stay the night at our home for his own safety and convenience. After a series of overly dramatic convincing from my father, the man relented and decided to stay. I promised him I would drive him to the bus terminal to Laguna first thing in the morning.

It was past eleven in the evening when all the guests except for some family members and the old man had left. The celebration, however, did not entirely end, as my father, the old man, and I decided to sit at a table and pour ourselves more liquor. 

The two old timers’ conversation mostly circled around their time as fellow cab drivers working under the same cab operator. Occasionally, both men would reminisce on their exes and how they once shared the same girlfriend without them knowing until the same lady got pregnant by another cab driver from a different city.

As a thirty-one-year-old working man, it was a pleasure to see both my father and his friend reminisce about their past. As inexperienced as I was at that point in my life, I did little to contribute to the conversation. For the most part, I was there as a listener, a passenger on the two old men’s trip down memory lane. 

The conversation and drinking between all three of us lasted until past midnight. I was about to announce to my old drinking buddies that it was time to call it a night when suddenly, the old man told me to wait as he would like to tell a story he just remembered while reminiscing their past. 

My father sat straight up, seemingly taken out of his drunken stupor upon hearing his friend’s words. “What? You’re going to tell us that story again?” My father, in his drunken state, asked. “Yeah… I know I’ve told you this many times before, but your son hasn’t heard it yet.” The old man said in response. “Besides, what better way to end the night than with a good old scary story, eh?” The man added, accompanied by a chuckle.

“Alright, well, just so you know, my son here is easily spooked. Furthermore, he regularly drives through that same road where you said your encounters took place.”  My father jested, aiming to take a jab at my reluctance to listen to scary stories, especially ones about the infamous street that I knew my father was referring to. 

“Nahh..look at your son. He’s a grown-up. I’m sure he can take a few scary stories before bedtime tonight. Can you, son?” The old man uttered as his face turned towards me. “Yes, I sure can. I don’t mind a scary story before ending the night.” I confidently remarked. I didn’t know what to expect at that point, but I could tell then and there that it would be an interesting story. 

The old man fixed himself up, trying to shake off some of the alcohol in his system from a long night of drinking. “Alright, then. Here’s my story. A true life experience when I was still young, in the mid-70s, and I was in my mid-thirties if I remember correctly, and was still driving a cab with your father.” His face once again turned in my direction. “This was when I encountered something I thought only existed in horror movies or novels. An encounter which, at that time, I seriously thought would be the end of me.” The man recounted, now audibly, with a more somber tone. 

The old man’s name was Rico, and this was his story:

It was close to midnight when Rico, driving a cab assigned to him by his operator, found himself driving along the desolate stretch of Balete Drive. The streetlights flickered, casting eerie shadows from the towering balete trees that lined the road. Rico hated taking this route due to its infamy, not only due to alleged hunting but mainly due to the street’s poor lighting, mostly obscured by the tall balete trees.

The area was known to be accident-prone, and tragedies involving all sorts of motorists are reported almost monthly. His last passenger had insisted it was the quickest way to her destination. A young lady dressed in a bright red gown trying to get to a college prom held at a convention center within the nearby University of the Philippines campus.

Rico dropped his passenger off at the main gate of the convention hall and contemplated going back the same way he came, as doing so would allow for the shortest time to exit Balete Drive. Then, he remembered the time. It was fifteen past ten, and he was supposed to be at home by eleven. While his operating hours typically lasted until the wee hours, he wanted to get home early and get to bed the rest of the night. He needed to wake up early the following morning as he was contracted to drive a neighbor who was going abroad to the Middle East to an international airport in Pasay City, Manila.

This basically means that going back to the portion of the street where he entered would require him to take a longer route back home. The alternative was to take the rest of Balete Drive, exiting at a main highway leading up to his residence in Caloocan (ka-lo-o-can). While very unappealing, this option would cut his travel time by about half an hour.

After much contemplation, Rico decided to continue traversing Balete Drive. “If I just focus my attention on the road and don’t think of the stories, I should be able to exit the street in no time,” Rico said to himself, trying to suppress his apprehension. “Besides, those are just stories. Urban tales shared among friends on a drinking binge.” He added. And so, Rico went on to take the remaining distance out of Balete Drive.

The night was dark, and the moon hung low in the sky, casting a pale light over the road. The only sound was the engine's hum and the occasional rustle of leaves. Rico glanced at the clock. It was late, and he was still far from home. He turned up the radio, hoping some music would ease his tension, but the signal was weak. Only static filled the air, adding to the eerie atmosphere.   
  
Rico focused on the road ahead. “Just a few more kilometers,” he thought. However, the darkness seemed to stretch endlessly. Each turn brought unexpected bumps and shadows. He tried to keep his mind on the driving, but strange shapes flickered at the edge of his vision.

“Just my imagination,” he muttered to himself. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something watched him. Every so often, he’d catch a glimpse of movement in the trees. A stray dog? A cat? Or perhaps some college students that were up to no good? Rico shook his head, trying to dispel the creeping unease.

As he turned onto a curve suddenly, his headlights caught something. On the side of the road stood a figure—a woman in a white dress, her hair long and tangled. She looked lost and afraid. Rico’s heart raced. “Should I help her? ” he thought. But the road was dark, and his instincts told him to keep driving.

Rico hesitated but eventually slowed down. A potential passenger this late at night was rare, and fares had been scarce all day.

“Where to, ma’am?” Rico asked, rolling down the window slightly.

The woman didn’t respond. She simply opened the back door and slid into the seat behind him. Her movements were slow and deliberate, and Rico couldn’t help but notice how cold the air suddenly felt.

“Balintawak (ba-lin-ta-wak),” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Rico nodded and began driving, trying to ignore the strange chill creeping up his spine. The road was eerily quiet, save for the hum of his engine. He glanced in the rearview mirror, hoping to catch a clearer look at his passenger. 

  
“Where exactly in Balintawak would you like me to take you, miss? ” he asked, but she only stared ahead. The road twisted and turned beneath him, and the night seemed to grow darker. Rico’s mind raced. Was this a good decision? Should he have driven away?

Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw something alarming in the mirror—behind them, the shadows seemed to grow larger and darker, and an unshakable feeling of dread washed over him. He pressed the gas pedal, desperate to escape the growing fear. 

Rico’s heart is now racing. A million thoughts ran through his mind. The lady in white still hadn’t spoken a word since providing her destination. At this point, Rico decided to look in the rearview mirror to check on the woman in the backseat of the cab once again, but what he saw froze him.

The woman’s face was a blank void—no eyes, no nose, no mouth. Just an empty, pale surface where her features should have been.

Panic gripped him. He tried to focus on the road, but the rearview mirror seemed to pull his gaze back. The woman’s head was now tilted slightly as if she were staring directly at him, though she had no eyes to do so.

Rico slammed on the brakes, his heart pounding. “Ma’am, please, you need to get out!” he shouted, his voice trembling.

The woman didn’t move. Instead, she leaned forward, and he felt her cold breath against his ear.

“Why are you afraid?” she whispered. “You picked me up, didn’t you?”

The woman’s words were accompanied by a chilling mist that penetrated through Rico’s body. This was his breaking point. He stopped the cab right in the middle of the road and turned to the woman in the backseat, wanting to tell his passenger to get out of the vehicle right away.

But, as he turns, the woman vanishes from the car, nowhere to be found. Rico was at a loss for words. Was he just imagining things? Was there really a woman a few minutes ago inside the vehicle? “Am I finally losing it?” Was Rico’s final thought. 

With the woman no longer inside the vehicle, Rico started the vehicle’s engine again and continued to drive down the empty road. His knuckles turned white while tightly gripping the steering wheel. He glanced at the vehicle’s speedometer, which was clocking in more than a hundred kilometers per hour, twice the road’s speed limit of no more than fifty kilometers. 

Rico couldn’t care less at that point, as his only thoughts were to get out of the accursed Balete Drive as soon as possible. Then, after a few minutes of driving at a dangerous speed, Rico realized something. 

“Where the heck is the exit? Was Rico’s initial thought. “This road seems never to end. I’ve driven through this same road during the day, and I don’t remember the road being this long.” Rico added, muttering to himself in a desperate attempt to make sense of what was happening.

He glanced at the clock; time was passing, yet he hadn’t reached the exit. Almost an hour had passed, and Rico was still driving along Balete Drive. “This can’t be real.” Rico once again muttered to himself. “Soon, I’ll run out of gas. There’s no way I’m stopping along this road. I’ll stay inside the car and spend the rest of the night if I have to.” This was Rico’s feeble attempt at a plan should he run out of gas while trying to exit Balete Drive. 

After more than an hour had passed, Rico saw what appeared to be light in the distance, a small light flickering through his windshield. Hope surged through him. He sped towards it, hoping that he was finally nearing the exit. But as he got closer, the light vanished, leaving only darkness behind. Rico looked around. The trees now seemed to close in on him, and he felt trapped. “Please, what the heck is going on? ” he asked to nobody, his voice trembling.

Rico was growing desperate and more terrified at that point. Terrified that he may never be able to reach the exit. “Am I dead? Did the woman earlier actually end my life, and now I’m just another ghost driving along this forsaken road on an endless journey to escape? Is this the afterlife? Am I in limbo?” A series of thoughts flooded Rico’s mind, with each one drawing him closer to a somber but likely conclusion. 

In Rico’s mind, he might as well no longer be in the world of the living as there was no making sense of the events that had unfolded. Another half an hour passed, and Rico was getting tired of the endless driving. He was so tired that he even considered stopping in the middle of the road and accepting his fate. 

“No! I’m not going down without a fight! I still have my hunting knife tucked in under my seat.” This was Rico’s last flicker of resolve while checking out for the hunting knife that was gifted to him by a friend in the army.  The hunting knife has given Rico the confidence to fight off any potential robbers during his night shift. That same knife was giving him hope to, at the very least, have something to fight whatever malevolent entity that had been causing him such torment.

A few more minutes had passed when suddenly, his headlights caught something. He hit the brakes. Now, standing in the middle of the road was the same woman in a white dress, her hair long and tangled. “Oh, shi-!” It’s that woman again!” Rico exclaimed as he hit the gas and tried to drive around the woman. Just as he was about to pass her, the woman instantly vanished in thin air. Rico, however, did not stop driving. 

He was not picking up the same scary lady this time. Rico continued to drive. The road was now getting even narrower, with a steep drop on one side. He pressed on, his knuckles whiter than ever.   
  
The figure appeared again at several more turns, always maintaining the same distance. Rico’s hands trembled as he struggled to maintain control of the car. The road was becoming increasingly treacherous, with potholes and loose gravel making driving a challenge. His heart pounded in his chest, and beads of sweat trickled down his temples. 

Rico does not remember the road being this rough. The road, in fact, was among the most well-maintained, as it services motorists going in and out of the nearby university. This mattered very little to Rico. In his mind, he might as well have veered off course, ending up in a remote, secluded road that may very well lead to his eventual demise. Rico, however, kept driving.

Not a moment had passed when Rico suddenly felt an all too familiar sensation. The sensation that someone was with him in the vehicle. The atmosphere inside the vehicle almost instantly turned chilly, accompanied by a subtle but audible breathing in the backseat of the taxi. “You’re here again, aren’t you?” Rico remarked with a now surprisingly braver tone. 

The events leading up to that point have exhausted Rico of all his fears. He somewhat became desensitized to the woman’s presence inside the vehicle, and he had long come to an understanding that if this was going to be his end, then so be it. But Rico intended to fight back, whether it be using his knife or any means that would at the very least give him comfort that he went down like a man, fighting.

“I… I just want to go to my family..” Came a chilling voice from the back. “Will… you take me there… mister?” Added by the woman in the back. “Where, to Balintawak?” Rico calmly responded, trying to sound as casual as possible. “Ye… yesss… Balintawak.” Responded the woman in affirmation.

“Alright, alright. I can take you there.” Answered Rico. “But you see, you have to pay a fare for me to take you there, you know.” Rico added while now displaying his usual self as a taxi driver. There was no response from the woman in the back, however. 

“You see here, this is what we call a taxi meter.” Rico continued speaking while tapping on the taxi meter. Still, there was no response from the passenger. “This thing clocks in the distance we’ve traveled and calculates how much it’ll cost.” Rico went on to elaborate without paying any mind to his passenger’s silence. “From my estimate, the total fare from here to Balintawak should cost you around five hundred peso-“ Rico’s sentence was cut short by a new development inside the vehicle. 

The woman, who had been silent the whole time Rico was talking, all of a sudden grabbed Rico’s right hand with a grip so tight that it almost restricted blood flow to the rest of Rico’s arm. The woman’s unexpected move caused panic in Rico, shattering his initial façade of calmness and fearlessness. 

The man frantically tried to shake his right hand off of the woman’s vice grip to no avail. The woman’s hand felt ice cold, so cold that it delivered a level of pain to Rico’s entire body that he never knew he would get to feel. “Get off me, you wretched!” Rico commanded while trying to steer the vehicle from going off the road with his left hand.

The woman, however, did not relent in her assault and finally blared in Rico’s ear the words: “TAKE… ME… TO… BALINTAWAK..!” The words were so loud that Rico could feel his eardrums shattering and the vehicle’s glass windows and windshield vibrating, about to break in any second. 

Rico instinctively reached out for the hunting knife tucked safely underneath the driver’s seat with his left hand, momentarily letting go of the steering wheel. He effortlessly unsheathed the knife from its scabbard and, with all his might, stabbed the woman by the hand that was taking hold of his right arm. The knife, however, failed even to penetrate the woman’s skin. The knife would seemingly bounce off the woman’s arm with every stab that Rico attempted. 

Rico, seeing that his attacks didn’t work on the woman’s arm, aimed to stab his attacker in the face. The car, at this point, has been swerving left to right with Rico’s remaining free hand alternating between attacking the woman and manning the steering wheel. 

Rico positioned the knife to point what he assumed was the direction of the woman’s face. With the remaining strength he could muster, Rico took one full swing with the knife in his left hand at his attacker’s face. The almost ninety-degree left hook landed its intended target, the woman’s face. 

While Rico could not exactly tell where the tip of the knife landed, he surmised that it was somewhere on the lower left eye of the woman. To his horror, however, even the long-winded attack did no damage to the woman in the back. The woman did not budge and continued her vice grip on Rico’s right arm while wailing the same words as before: “TAKE… ME… TO… BALINTAWAK..!”

At that moment, Rico realizes the woman isn't simply a ghost; she's a malevolent entity feeding on his fear, slowly draining his life force with every second the cold, bony hand clutches into his. Left with no other choice, Rico turned to other means he knew could potentially ward off ghosts, ghouls, evil spirits, and anything that comes bumping into the night: Prayer.

Up until that point, Rico never considered himself a religious person. Although born and raised as a Roman Catholic, he rarely attends church or mass. He would only do so during his birthdays and Christmas Eve mass and if his devoutly  Catholic parents would drag him to attend Sunday mass each time they visited him from the province. 

While growing up in the province, Rico spent all four of his high school years at a Catholic school. During all those years, he learned to memorize common prayers, the names of several saints, and other religious invocations that surprisingly stayed with him even now that he was in his early thirties. 

Not being able to make the Sign of the Cross using his right hand, he did it with his left. This time, Rico decided to fight the entity not with physical force, which proves useless against the ethereal being, but with his will, invoking religious symbols, prayers, and anything to repel the malevolent spirit. 

Rico cried out to the Heavens for protection, for salvation. He called out all the names of the saints he knew, promised to attend every Sunday mass for the rest of his life, and ultimately made a promise to become a changed man should he survive the terrifying ordeal.

The struggle becomes a terrifying battle of wills, a fight for his sanity and his life, as the eyeless woman in white relentlessly tries to pull him into the darkness. The woman, however, is undeterred, and the car becomes a battleground between the driver’s unyielding faith and a demon eager to claim its next victim.

In a race against time, Rico doubles down on reciting prayers from his childhood, testing his faith and courage as the woman now seemingly tries to take control of the taxi, steering it towards a ditch in the side of the road. 

Desperate and determined, Rico draws on the power of his prayers, invoking ancient verses that resonate with divine strength. The woman, who now resembles more of a demonic entity, roars in fury, but Rico’s unwavering faith begins to weaken its hold. With a final, resounding prayer, Rico confronts the demon head-on, channeling all his hope and courage into one last plea for deliverance. 

And, when the tussle between Rico and the now demon-looking woman seemed never to end, a saving grace unexpectedly came. A beam of light from a semi’s headlight illuminated the vehicle. The instant illumination momentarily distracted Rico from his ordeal. For a moment, time seemed to freeze. Rico could not believe what he was seeing. A truck driven by a live human being. Even with just a second, Rico could see the male driver of the semi with his bull cap on.

At this point, Rico did not even notice that his taxi had ceased to move. He somehow managed to hit the brakes amidst the chaos and halted the vehicle to a full stop on his side of the road. Then, in only a matter of a few seconds, his awareness returned to the tribulation at hand. The demonic-looking woman, however, is gone. The woman somehow disappeared when the semi truck’s light hit the vehicle. 

Rico, not wanting to let his guard down and not fully believing that his torment was finally over, spun around the vehicle, trying to find any trace of the woman in a white dress. Finally, after what felt like hours of thoroughly checking the vehicle and the surroundings, Rico leaned back in the driver’s seat and exhaled a deep sigh of relief. 

Rico’s heart was still pounding at an exhilarated speed, and the pain in his right arm from the woman’s grip still persisted, but Rico knew that this time, he was saved. He took another few minutes to catch his abated breath before starting the ignition, and with visibly shaking hands, grabbed the steering wheel and continued to drive along Balete Drive.

Not long after, a green metal sign perched atop a metal pole had the sign that read, “You are now exiting Balete Drive.” Rico almost broke into tears upon reading the sign. “I made it! I survived!” Rico exhaled to himself with clenched fists, pounding the steering wheel for a triumphant victory over a terrifying ordeal. 

Rico made it home at two in the morning. Needless to say, he did not get any sleep and ended up fetching his neighbor an hour earlier than agreed. The neighbor did not mind the early transport to the international airport, though, as it would give them ample time to sort out everything for their travel abroad.

The ordeal left a deep mark on Rico’s life. He actively avoids Balete Drive during his shift, and if the situation really needs him to, he makes sure to drive along the road during the day. Rico also fulfilled the promises he made during his encounter at Balete Drive. He attended Sunday mass as much as he could and even became a layman later on after retiring from his job as a taxi driver. Nowadays, Rico enjoys the retired life with his family at his residence in Laguna. 

“Well, what can you say, kid? Was that a great, scary story I just told?” Recto went on to ask while gently slapping my left arm. “Yeah, it was a cool story. I’m glad you made it out alive!” I responded with an audible chuckle, signaling that while I enjoyed the story, I was unsure of its authenticity. Rico caught on to my sarcasm and showed me his right arm. “Tell me, son, what do you see?” Rico asked. I looked at him, unsure of what he wanted me to see, but I subsequently turned to the old man’s right arm while squinting my eyes. 

The old man’s skin has turned dull and wrinkled due to his advanced age, but upon careful inspection, I swear I could see a print, a hand print that, although subtle, had a clear outline of human fingers attached to a palm. “Is that what I think it is?” Was all I could say after making out a handprint on the old man’s right arm. 

“Yes, kid, it is exactly what you think it is,” Rico responded in affirmation and with a chuckle. I could only look at the old man with apparent disbelief at that point. “Are… are we done?” Our conversation was interrupted by my father, who had just woken from a nap. Unbeknownst to us, my old man fell asleep shortly after Rico started recounting his experience. 

My father had already heard the same story from his friend more times than he could count, and he would not surely mind not hearing it another time. “Yeah, I think we’re done here. I’m already way past my bedtime as it is.” Rico jested with an audible laughter. 

The two old men went to bed at around one in the morning. Rico’s recounting of the story lasted for almost an hour. I stayed awake for a few minutes in order to clean the table where we had our little soiree. 

The next morning, I made good on my promise and drove Rico to the bus station with buses that would take him home to Laguna. In tow was my father riding shotgun. After telling his scary story, Rico and I had somewhat developed a bond and he requested to be seated in the passenger seat next to me. Along the way, the old man and my father continued their conversation, reminiscing about the past. Rico occasionally spills out silly secrets from my father’s past life, all in good fun.

After forty-five minutes of driving, we arrived at the bus station. All three of us exited my car, and Rico, sporting a huge smile on his face, hugged me and my father and promised to return the following year. We finally bade Rico goodbye, and my father and I drove back home shortly after. 

Every now and then, I remember Rico’s story about his encounter with a malevolent entity and the long, empty, unending road. I would contemplate whether to believe the old man’s story was true each time. While Rico’s story may be just one of the many fabricated tales and creepy stories about the infamous road, I could also tell that the old man was not lying when he recounted his experience. 

While ultimately, I cannot say that I believe his story, on the other hand, I believe that the old man fully believes that his encounter was real. I would always be reminded of the old man’s story every time I happened to drive by the same road. I may not admit it, but as a precaution, I avoided driving through the road late at night. 

This concludes one of the many tales surrounding the infamous street along Quezon City. This is James, and this is the end of the story of Rico, the taxi, and the Woman in White of Balete Drive.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Taisa, Venlil Starship Engineer, Crystal Star Shipping Co-Owner**

Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: November 13th, 2136

*Almost there, Heartwood; just a few more minutes!*

The last notes of that oh so familiar [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqJ3p3xkRes) faded into the frozen inky black night air, stirring warm memories of our first paw aboard the exchange station. The first paw of what would become my life. The first paw I started *actually* doing things for myself. The first paw I’d face my fears and keep pushing forwards. The first paw I actually got to meet the friend I’d come to know. The first paw I met the man I loved.

*I really do still need to get that book.*

“Now ain’t that somethin’?” Chris gasped into the microphone, exhausted after nearly a quarter-claw up on stage, “Lord only knew how much better everything’d sound out here in the valley! And how about this band, eh? Give it up for the, uh…” He eased back onto his stool as the younger, more energetic band bounced about around him. He placed a hand over the mic and beckoned one over, the gangly Venlil bounding over with a curious ear as Chris muttered something to the girl. The pup’s ears flared in alarm, searching wildly to her herdmates around her as her mouth ran aflurry with a panicked answer. Chris gave her my favorite smile and waved a placating hand, doing his best to ease her wool as he turned back to the mic and belted a lively introduction. “Give it up for the Little Lights!!”

A chorus of cheers, whistles, whoops and bellows of encouragement rippled through the herds around us as a burning bloom spread beneath my wool. Chris let out a hearty laugh, a brilliant smile splitting his face as he continued. “That’s the kind of reaction we like to hear! Now, I got one song left ‘fore we get to the main event, and the Mourning. So just sit back, settle in and let’s remember what we’re all here for. Remember the people we’ve lost, the love stories cut short and the lives that have been taken from us. Remember what they did. Remember that we’re still here…”

“Remember *them*.” He lifted a hand, counting off with his fingers to the band behind him before they sprouted into a mournful, slow growing [melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKjxrlC-teA). Chris’ voice wept into the empty air around us, drifting across the fairgrounds and weaving between the stalls as every coat, every ear and every eye turned their attention on him and the band around him. 

A mourning tone sank into his voice as he sang, the sound stabbing at my heart as he moved through the song. All the pain he’d been holding poured free, flowing like Amarek sap from his soul as the instruments around him rose to meet his voice.

*Then today while walking lost, I saw a sign*

*That without effort brought your name to mind*

*So I decided to reach out after so long*

*Decided how we left it was all wrong*

He shook his head as the instruments subsided, the quintet behind him letting out a low, mournful whistle and hum. Calling out into night’s cold, void tinted embrace for people who some had lost and some never had the chance to know. 

The herds around us were silent as they played, countless Venlil attending to their new Human friends. Some were stood stock still, some swayed to the sound, staring up into the sky like they were looking for something or someone to look back. Many more looked shaken, falling apart into their newfound caring coats as they let the tears behind their eyes fall free. It all reminded me of one thing I wished I’d known from the very beginning. Wished I’d known before I’d met Chris on the station and made a fool of myself in front of him. Wished everyone around me had realized so much *sooner*.

*I'm sorry I wasn't there, I wish I'd known*

*I would've tried to give you love it'd been so long since I'd shown*

*But then had I, maybe you'd be here today*

*Suffering and crushing from sadness and its weight*

Humans were **people**… Loving, feeling **people** as vulnerable and capable of pain as any prey species in all of the Federation. Sometimes more so. No Human I’d ever met had looked down on me. None of them had ever shamed me, had ever made me feel worthless, or in the way. None of them had ever hurt me… 

Not like other prey had.

I found Mama’s paw on my shoulder, her tail twining tight with mine while Renkel pressed tight into my side; Mama let out a reassuring purr and turned to listen. Behind her, Darlene and Michael were at Anne’s side, pressed in close to their daughter as Chris cried his pain out into the very Night itself. 

*I hear there's faeries out on Jupiter*

*And there was a time when I knew one*

*But today I'm feeling way down here on Earth*

*Crying tears of love in the light of mourning dawn*

The melody continued, thin and wavering as they called out into the void, reaching out to those who were lost and gone. Those hanging, mournful notes faded, drifting on Night’s gentle breeze to be whisked away up into the Heartwood’s golden embrace. Silence hung behind them a few moments, broken only by the breeze’s gentle whisper carrying the sound of Venlil consoling their Humans before a rising tide of applause, encouragement, and grateful whistles sung through the valley. Chris and the band stood there for a few long moments, looking out across the festival grounds and taking in the sight.

“Thank you…” Chris coughed, wiping at his eyes a little as he readjusted on his stool and pulled the microphone closer. “Thank you. I hope that things are going well for most of you but; well I know for a lot of us they just ain’t. And thank you to the people of Heartwood that have stepped up to help us, Venlil, Gojid, Takkan and Sivkit alike. I know it’s not easy for a lot of you but… but it means a lot. To me. To your new friends. To the people they miss. You all have made an astounding difference in people's lives and helped to keep us all in better shape’n we would’a been without you.”

A few calls of agreement and thanks split the air to meet him, pushing a wonderful blossom of laughter into his voice. As Chris continued, Lentan stepped on stage with Elena close behind. “That in mind: I think, for now at least, we’re done with the music. There’s somehtin’ far more important at hand what needs doin’.”

Lentan padded to Chris’ side, accepting the microphone as Chris stood and set his guitar back into its case. *>Thank you.<* “Thank you, Chris; that was very kind. And thank you, to the Little Lights for providing us with a wonderful half-claw of music!”

The five teens behind him gave a gracious wave before returning to their instruments, quietly chatting between themselves and Chris; the two Venlil asking questions with excited tails as Lentan resumed. “We will begin the Mourning shortly. Those of you who have chosen to participate for their first time - and your guides - please make your way to the wayward shore with your star carrier. Those who wish to watch, feel free to find somewhere comfortable to settle down along the leeward shore.”

The microphone *clacked* as he set it back into the cradle, turning to follow Elena offstage as Chris and the band followed not far behind. Chris split off, striding towards us as the teens bolted off to the shore just behind the stage, finding a nice patch of sand to settle down on their blankets.

“Good Job, Love.” I whistled as he approached, wrapping a tight hug around him while Mama and Papa rounded up Renkel and set about tidying the stall with Darlene and Michael’s help.

“I try my best, Darlin’.” He rumbled back, pulling me into a tight hug with a contented sigh before glancing over to Mama and Papa. “You two need any more help?”

*>Sarcastic<* “Oh no, it’s fine, Rensa, Renkel, your parents and I’ve got it allll under control. You two love-sick dulbets keep right on at it!” Papa whistled back, amusement in his voice as he heaved Darlene’s vast pot of gumbo up onto the warmer with an exaggerated grunt.

“Alright, alright, I can take a hint.” Chris grumbled, rising to help Papa as I padded to Darlene and Mama’s side to help organize the trays and tools.

Before long the stand was organized and cleaned up spic and span, ready to get right back to serving after the break spent at the Mourning. On the way to our spot we stopped, collecting as much Hikic as we could carry to keep our coats, and new family, warmed against night’s gnawing cold. The beach on the leeward side of the basin was quiet, dimly lit by the softening lights of the festival and the faint bioluminescence in the basin. Delicious warmth filled my mouth and seeped into my wool as I sipped my Hikic before plopping down into Chris’ lap, gently nuzzling up into his neck for a moment before turning my attention to the small, growing flame of the Mourning’s candlelight.

Anne, Darlene, and Michael let out a gasp as the lights dimmed even further, sinking to little more than a dim glow that cast thready, stretching shadows across the vast sparkling shore of the basin. Drifting snowflakes glittered in the air, dancing like flower birds playing in a dayside wind. Yinol’s familiar whistle split the distant air, calling to life a *sea* of candles along the shoreline that dwarfed anything else I’d ever seen. Those wild flickering lights turned the very basin itself into a pane of light, every wave a glint, every ripple a shimmer, every crest a reflection of the amassed *pain* of the Venlil and their new herdmates. A somber call of whistles, bleats and gentle beeps sounded out from amongst the candles and the shoreline, encouraging and consoling the participants onwards. Doing everything they could to *help*.

It was *beautiful*.

The stars above were blotted by the Basin’s light. What was usually a mirror stretching into the void, the distant horizon a sheer line of demarcation between the basin and that welcoming tapestry of the void above. The star lanterns glowed, bright and plentiful, seemingly more vast in number than the very stars themselves. 

The vast flotilla of star lanterns crowded the basin side, slowly spreading out across the water to fill the entire valley with light, life and flickering shadow. Polani’s guide took the stage alongside them and looked no brighter than any of the others, the largest of them lost amongst the new herd it sought to guide into the stars and her warm embrace above. 

My attention slipped from the sight, gilding over to the herd of Humans and Venlil that crowded the launch. Families of Humans were surrounded, held tight by supporting coats that wanted nothing more than to help. To help their new friends, their new herds with all the strife and pain in their worlds. They’d put their tails into it and challenged whatever fear stalked their hearts to light hope for people who needed every mote of it they could grasp onto.

And Polani shined all the brighter for it, welcoming this swell of light, hope and assuaged pain into her loving paws. Welcoming these strangers, these broken, pained ‘predators’ into her herd to keep them and their lost loves safe in her embrace. It was all I could ever hope for, that paw Chris and I had decided to come home to Heartwood. It was all I’d wanted of my town since I’d met him. It was… Perfect.

“God above…” Anne whispered, her voice muffled behind her hands and the steaming mug of Hikic. “It’s just like…”

“Hoi An?” Chris rumbled, his voice rolling through my chest as he nodded a little. “I thought the same thing the morn’ after.”

“And Pingxi!” Anne exclaimed with hissed amazement, her eyes wide and glittering as she stared out at the ocean of stars that filled the Basin to bursting. “It’s so *familiar!”*

“It is?” *>Really?<* Mama asked, her ears raised with curiosity as she turned to peer up at Chris and then over to Chris.

“There’s at *least* three I can think of off the top of my head!” She answered, taking a sip of her Hikic before continuing. “Shinnyo, Pingxi and Hoi An are all *beautiful* and…”

“I’d love to see them sometime…” Mama whispered, staring out at the lanterns on the basin, her tail twitching contentedly at the thought. “...sometime.”

“Mama can we go to Earth?!” Renkel whistled, squirming excitedly in Darlene’s lap as he batted playfully at her hands, eliciting an amused laugh from Chris’ mother. “I wanna go and see all the fishies!” 

“We’ll see, little Rekan…” Mama answered, her ears splayed in thought as she reached over to brush his crown aside before nuzzling him gently with an amused purr. “But you’ll have to behave.”

“I will!” He all but bleated, nodding vigorously as he settled himself back into Darlene’s lap, doing his best to behave with that adorable little ‘serious’ face he’d put on whenever Mama tempted him with something he wanted. 

“Well, I think it’s a great idea!” Papa whistled, pulling Mama close to nuzzle her cheek. “Just think of all the new foods Darlene could show us!”

“Oh hell you ain’ seen *nothin’* yet, Tai’.” Michael chided with a rolling laugh that felt so… *familiar*.

“Oh, I’ve not been disappointed yet!  I’m certainly excited to see what *else* Humans have made- as long as it doesn’t have any *meat* in it.”

“Believe me, Ma’s got the best options for Vegan in every town, state, country and continent in that head of hers.” Anne chimed in, a smile spread wide across her face as she continued, looking out across the basin at fond memories. “There wasn’t a dig site one I went on that I didn’t know the nearest restaurant to go to!”

“Honestly, Taikel,” Anne continued, turning her eyes to the Valley’s vast walls, “I was thinkin’ of showin’ you an’ your family a few’ve our older slate structures. Berenez, Trulli, the tower in Glendalough… take you on a whole tour of europe an’ the med while we’re at it.”Papa’s ears were confused, even if his voice played with performed enthusiasm, “That sounds great, Anne! What’re we seeing?” Anne smirked as she looked at Taikel, “Houses that look *just like* yours… ‘Cept they’re a touch taller an’ a few thousand years old.”

*HOW OLD?*

“Stars above…” Papa breathed, his ears swinging high in surprise as he locked eyes with Mama. “That’s… that’s older than the *Federation*.”

“Three or four times I think.” I agreed, mystified at the prospect of something surviving *that* long. “I can’t even think of anything in the federation, let alone on VP that’s that old!”

“Really?” Chris rumbled, shifting to look down at me with a spike of curiosity. “There’s towers in Syria that’re o’er ten *thousand* years old an’ still around.”

“Shit, the oldest building in Louisiana was up the road from my shop it’s… four hundred some odd years old now? Folks ‘cross the pond’d call that positively *new!*” Darlene chimed in, looking perplexed at the idea. “Still doing Dollar Tequila Tuesdays, last I went! Y’all don’t have anything that old?”

“I- We *do* but…” I trailed off, looking at the Valley walls. “They’ve been taken apart and put back together so many times. The oldest building here in Heartwood only *just* predates when the Federation came a-and outside of that there’s only a few buildings any older than that! Most of what came before the federation is just gone.”

“So you…” Anne started, sadness in her eyes before turning her attention to me with wide curiosity. “What *do* you know from before the Federation?”

“Plenty!” Mama chirped, her tail coiling around Renkel’s as he clambered into her lap with a happy whistle, hardly paying attention to the rest of the conversation as he babbled excitedly about going to Earth. “It’s just that things get replaced. Why keep the old when the new is so much better?”

“Because it’s history! Why get rid of it at all?” Anne exclaimed, throwing her arms wide with a smile. “It’s everything that came before! It’s the lessons learned by our ancestors! It’s their *lives* made real!”

“We keep museums for that! Where it can be preserved and kept safe so that we can make our own history where our foreherds lived and prospered.”

“Well then I’d *love* to go see one of your museums!” Anne smiled, her enthusiasm as bright as I’d imagined it would be. “And I’ll take you to see every living history site I can think of when you come to Earth!” 

“Deal!” Mama and Papa agreed as Renkel lept from her lap with his paws as high as his ears.

“Museums! I wanna go to the animal Museum again!” He exclaimed, bouncing in place. “Wanna see Profeb… Profetper… The nice gray Human again!”

*Oh stars, Anne what’ve you done!*

It was late August of 1962, and the orchard was at its greenest. Our small pear trees—Papa’s pride—stretched along irrigation ditches, their leaves rattling softly in the dry California breeze. The family collie, Rex, trotted beside me as I followed Papa out into the fields, my shoes kicking up dust beneath the high summer sun. We were the Vieira family: Papa, Mama, my sister Teresa, and me. We lived in a farmhouse that seemed to grow out of the orchard soil, its paint faded by years of sunshine and orchard work.

Rex had been with us for a while, a scrawny pup when Papa first brought him home. He’d grown into a large, shaggy collie, all gentle eyes and wagging tail, but not the smartest animal you’d ever meet. He was harmless enough—loved to splash in muddy irrigation water and sometimes followed Papa for hours as he worked—but Mama never took to him. She was raised to keep animals outside and firmly believed in it. So Rex slept in the yard, never crossing the threshold of our door unless forced. If he wandered into Mama’s vegetable patch, she chased him out with a broom, shouting scolding words in Portuguese or English depending on how vexed she was. And if he approached the house too closely, she stomped her foot until he backed away, tail tucked and ears low.

Rex didn’t seem to mind too much. He found comfort napping under the porch or poking his nose around the fern garden near the house. He had a particular fondness for the small cluster of grapevines Mama had planted alongside the orchard’s edge. The grapes were sweet and tempting, but the vines were guarded by swarms of aggressive bees. Rex never learned his lesson—he stuck his nose in, got stung, yelped, and backed away, rubbing his face on the ground. Yet somehow, a day or two later, he would try again, drawn by the scent of those grapes. Papa said the dog had “more heart than brains.” Teresa and I just called him stubborn.

That summer, a neighbor’s pit bull started roaming outside its usual bounds. We’d seen it skulking near the end of the orchard, a mean-looking animal, all muscle and sharp teeth. None of us were eager to encounter it, but we hoped it would stay away. Then one hot afternoon, while Papa and I were clearing brush, we heard a terrible yelp. Rex had wandered out of sight, probably following some scent. We rushed toward the commotion. Coming around the corner of the old toolshed, we found the pit bull locked onto Rex’s shoulder, teeth sunk deep into his fur.

“Papa!” I shouted, panic tightening my chest.

Papa didn’t hesitate. He ran into the shed and came out with his old shotgun. It was loaded with birdshot, nothing lethal if you kept your distance, but enough to scare off any beast. He shouted, stepping forward, “Ei! Vai-te!” Then he fired a single shot into the air. The sharp blast rattled the orchard’s quiet. The pit bull flinched and let go, backing away as another spray of birdshot peppered the ground near its paws. The dog growled, then bolted off, its tail whipping behind it.

Papa dropped to his knees beside Rex. The collie whined softly, blood matting his coat, his shoulder torn. I stood a few feet away, trembling, not sure what to do. Mama came running, apron fluttering, her eyes dark with concern.

“He’s hurt,” Papa said quietly. Mama, who so often chased Rex away, knelt down and pressed her lips together. She looked at the wound, then at Papa, then back at the dog who lay panting in the dirt.

“We can’t leave him out here,” Mama said after a moment. Her voice was firm. “Bring him to the fern garden. It’s shaded there.” Her tone was surprisingly gentle, as if seeing Rex battered and bleeding broke through her cool exterior.

We carried Rex carefully over to the side of the house. The fern garden was Mama’s pride—lush and green with delicate fronds, nourished by careful watering. Normally, she would never have let a muddy, wounded dog near her precious plants. But now she quietly fetched warm water and clean cloth, and gently cleaned Rex’s wound. Teresa appeared with gauze and bandages from the cupboard. I watched, amazed. Mama spoke softly, half in English, half in Portuguese, as she pressed a damp cloth to the wound. Rex whimpered, eyes wide with pain, but he stayed still, trusting her.

“Calma,” Mama said, her voice quiet. “Calma.” Be calm.

After he was bandaged, Papa and I built a small shelter of burlap sacks near the ferns. Mama allowed Rex to stay there while he healed. She even left out a bowl of water and scraps of food, something she never would have done before. The orchard buzzed softly around us, bees drifting above the vines and fruit trees. Once Rex could stand, he limped over to sniff at the grapevines again, where the clusters hung ripe and sweet. This time Teresa caught him before he buried his nose too deeply and got stung yet again.

“Rex, you silly thing,” Teresa chided, scratching behind his ears. “Haven’t you learned your lesson about the bees?” But Rex just wagged his tail, as if thinking, “This time, maybe I’ll manage a taste before they get me.”

For the next few days, the orchard seemed to hold its breath around Rex’s recovery. Papa went out each morning to check the irrigation ditches. I tagged along, keeping an eye out for any sign of the pit bull. Mama watered her ferns, glancing over at Rex’s makeshift bed, and sometimes sighed as if puzzled by her own kindness. Teresa brought records and listened to music inside, humming tunes from Broadway shows under her breath. Now and then, she’d poke her head outside and call to Rex gently. Even if Mama wouldn’t let him inside the house, the boundary between indoors and out seemed softer now.

Slowly, Rex’s wounds scabbed over. He started putting weight on his injured leg. One bright morning, I found him with his nose in the grapevines again, yelping as bees stung his muzzle. I shouted at him, waved my arms, and chased him away from the angry insects. He backed off, shaking his head as if puzzled, then trotted back to his nook by the fern garden, tail wagging as if nothing had happened.

Mama watched from the porch steps, arms folded. I braced myself for a scolding, but instead she shook her head and clicked her tongue. “Tolo cão,” she said softly—“Foolish dog.” But there was a warmth in her voice I hadn’t heard before.

From then on, Rex recovered in the shade, and Mama allowed it. She never welcomed him into the kitchen, never let him near her table, and still chased him if he tracked mud across her garden rows. But there was a change now, a small softness in the way she looked at him. He was foolish, yes, stubborn, certainly—not the smartest dog we’d known—but he was ours, part of the orchard’s living tapestry.

The weeks went by, and the orchard began to prepare for harvest time. The pears swelled on their branches. The bees buzzed more aggressively around the grapes, and Rex still tested his luck now and then, with the same unfortunate results. But that was Rex—his heart bigger than his brain, his loyalty as fixed as the orchard’s seasons.

On late afternoons, I’d sit on the porch, Teresa’s singing drifting from inside, Papa’s footsteps crunching over the dusty paths. Mama might be shucking peas or stringing beans, and Rex would lie by the ferns, healing and content. He’d lift his muzzle at a passing breeze or bark lazily at a squirrel darting along the orchard fence. Sometimes Mama would glance his way. She might mutter under her breath about “trouble” or “silly dog,” but it was different now. Rex was not just tolerated—he was accepted, if only a little, into the fold of our family’s life.

That’s how I like to remember it: our orchard, the sweet smell of pears ripening in the sun, the dog recovering in the fern garden, and Mama’s faint smile as she watched him, reminded, perhaps, that even the stubborn and the foolish deserve a safe place to rest."

Have you ever wondered why you sometimes test as a different MBTI type? Have you discerned what causes this seeming glitch?,infj,1hb4qd7,2024-12-10 10:47:48,13,0.93,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1hb4qd7/have_you_ever_wondered_why_you_sometimes_test_as/,blacklightviolet,Question for INFJs only,"Picture this: an INFJ, minding their own business, untangling the threads of the universe like some low-key philosopher in their Ni-Fe cloud, when—**WHAM!**—life hurls a metaphorical wrench at their head. 

Enter stage left: a boss, a job, or that one co-worker who insists on ""brainstorming"" at 4 p.m. on a Friday. 

Suddenly, the INFJ is yanked out of their introspective bliss and thrown into an impromptu performance art piece called *How to Pretend I’m Not Slowly Dying Inside*.  

It’s like being a chameleon—only instead of blending in, you’re shoved into a disco ball, spinning through a kaleidoscope of personas because, apparently, adapting to chaos is your *thing*. 

Need a mediator? Sure. A strategist? Why not. Someone to pick up the emotional mess no one else wants to touch? Oh, absolutely. Who better than you, the human Swiss Army knife of emotional labor and existential dread?  

And let’s be frank, this shape-shifting survival act is why INFJs are so hard to pin down. At any given moment, we’re either solving someone else’s crisis, dodging small talk, or quietly spiraling into an existential black hole while maintaining an outward aura of calm competence.  

Which brings us to now: 4:25 a.m., sitting in the dark like a villain plotting their redemption arc, reflecting on the past week’s whirlwind of chaos. 

And it hits you—an epiphany so sharp it feels personal. 

There’s a reason we sometimes test as entirely different MBTI types: *we’ve been reprogramming ourselves for survival for years.*

Think back—at some point, someone praised you for being “so adaptable.” 

And like the overachieving people-pleaser you are, you leaned in. 

Needed an ENTJ for that project? Done. An ESFP for the party no one wanted to plan? Sure, why not. Congratulations! Your cognitive stack now moonlights as a personality circus, starring minor players in lead roles because apparently, being the “mystical counselor” wasn’t stressful enough.  

And so, here we are. Master shapeshifters. Emotional contortionists. The patron saints of quietly losing our minds while making it look effortless. It’s not pretty, but hey, survival never is.

In various (job assignment and family events and friend-group) situations I have had to adapt to survive by suddenly sending my usual cognitive order of operations into an alternate arrangement. Minor players become main characters. 

When an INFJ is under extreme stress, it’s as if their inner world—the one they’ve so carefully curated with intuitive foresight and emotional depth—gets flipped upside down and shaken like a snow globe. Except instead of glitter, it’s pure chaos raining down. This is the infamous “grip” state, where their normally harmonious cognitive stack does a complete 180, and they’re thrust into the uncharted waters of their shadow functions.  

Suddenly, that calm, insightful INFJ, with their Ni-Fe magic, is gone. In their place? A panicked, hyperactive version of themselves, driven by Se (Extroverted Sensing), the function they usually keep buried in the basement. Instead of pondering life’s mysteries and connecting dots only they can see, they’re laser-focused on *everything* happening *right now.* It’s sensory overload on steroids. They might become obsessed with details, binge on junk food, shop compulsively, or impulsively do something wildly out of character, like chopping off their hair at 3 a.m.  

And the Fe, which usually fuels their deep empathy and emotional insight, gets hijacked by its darker twin. They may lash out, overreact, or crumble into a self-pitying spiral, convinced the world is out to get them. The INFJ who usually finds meaning in everything is now drowning in every meaningless thing—loud noises, bad lighting, random annoyances—until their Te (Extroverted Thinking) shadow barges in like a drill sergeant with a clipboard. Suddenly, they’re barking orders, rigidly organizing, or coldly dismissing emotions as if they’re channeling an efficiency robot.  

The result? 

A surreal spectacle of contradictions: a hyper-aware, overstimulated INFJ trying to control everything around them while secretly falling apart inside. It’s like watching a philosopher try to fix a broken toaster by sheer willpower while yelling at it for being defective.  

To outsiders, this ""shadow INFJ"" may seem unrecognizable, even alarming. 

But for the INFJ, it feels like being trapped in someone else’s body—one that’s fueled by panic, reacting instead of reflecting, and spiraling into survival mode. It’s messy, uncomfortable, and deeply unsettling—a sharp departure from their usual state of quiet mastery.  

Eventually, though, the storm passes. They claw their way back to their Ni-Fe center, wiser for the chaos but exhausted by the detour. Until then, stay out of their way—and maybe hide the scissors.

**And it has me thinking…**

1. What situations have sent you into an alternate persona, just to survive?

2. How did you handle it?

3. How did it feel?

4. How did you reset?

**I came up with some hypothetical scenarios… I’m wondering if you’d like to add to any of these:**


## **1. INFJ in INTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Strategic War-Games Coordinator for Intergalactic Corporate Takeovers*.  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
The type who’d provoke this shift is an ENTJ boss who treats deadlines like commandments from the cosmos. They strut into the office with a “No fluff, only results” mantra, tossing phrases like “Synergy,” “ROI,” and “failure is NOT an option.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The once warm and soulful INFJ starts walking around with a clipboard and laser eyes, muttering about efficiency metrics and contingency plans. Their soft edges? Gone. They’re calling out inefficiencies, laying out 5-year strategies, and steamrolling anything that feels like “feelings.” Their aura shifts from “kind guru” to “robotic overlord.”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
The INFJ’s natural empathy gets buried beneath a fortress of Te (Extraverted Thinking). They start thinking in terms of systems, hierarchies, and strategic wins, but it doesn’t feel right. Ni still whispers “there’s more to this,” but Fe is suppressed, leaving them emotionally detached and unable to connect. Over time, this logical efficiency becomes suffocating—like being trapped in a glass box of cold, calculated analysis.  

**External Signs:**  
Their usually warm presence becomes distant and robotic. Others notice their sudden lack of interest in human dynamics, and they seem overly fixated on plans and outcomes, with no patience for emotions.  

**Antidote:**  
Reconnecting with human warmth is key. Take a break to engage in deeply empathetic activities: volunteer work, intimate conversations with loved ones, or simply journaling about their feelings. Physical grounding—like a walk in nature or a candlelit bath—helps thaw the icy detachment.  



## **2. INFJ in INFP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Experimental Poet Laureate for the Bureau of Whimsical Daydreams.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ISFP co-worker who casually tosses around deep questions like, “But how does this make your soul *feel*?” during coffee breaks.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly swaps their planner for a sketchpad. They start quoting Rumi and talking about the “essence of authenticity.” Instead of orchestrating deep, collective transformations, they’re wandering the office barefoot, humming folk songs, and chasing their own emotions like butterflies in a meadow.  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Operating in Fi (Introverted Feeling) over Fe feels like walking on emotional quicksand. They’re forced to turn inward, constantly analyzing their personal values and emotions, but without the INFJ’s natural inclination for collective harmony. Over time, they feel untethered—adrift in their own emotional whirlpool, struggling to find purpose without a sense of communal connection.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear dreamy but unproductive, perpetually “in their feelings” without offering the usual transformative insights they’re known for. Their usual ability to inspire others dims as they focus inward.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ needs to reengage with their Fe by organizing a small group gathering or helping someone solve a problem. Journaling about how they impact the greater good can also help them feel anchored. Sensory grounding through music or art can stabilize their emotional flux.  






## **3. INFJ in ENFJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Chief Charisma Officer for the Society of Global Inspiration Leaders*.  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ESFJ team lead who throws them into the limelight, shouting, “The people need you, STARSHINE!” They encourage them to become the face of every team initiative.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ goes from brooding quietly in their corner to working the room like a motivational rock star. They’re smiling, patting backs, leading standing ovations, and signing people up for life-changing workshops. Colleagues start whispering, “When did *they* get so... magnetic?”  



**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
At first, the shift to high-energy charisma might feel exhilarating, but soon, the constant outward focus leaves the INFJ drained and brittle. They’re operating on Fe (Extraverted Feeling) overdrive, neglecting Ni’s need for introspection. Without quiet time to process, their vision becomes shallow, their insights forced, and their empathy a performative act.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem like a social butterfly at first, but over time, cracks show: they become overly dramatic, reactive, and surface-level. People might say, “They’re not as deep as I thought.”  

**Antidote:**  
Solitude is the cure. A long, meditative retreat, a solo writing session, or even a weekend in bed with a book can restore their balance. Reconnecting with their Ni—through journaling or analyzing a personal dream—helps them regain depth.  






## **4. INFJ in ENTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Crisis Commander for the Department of Ruthless Solutions.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A “fire-in-the-belly” ESTP colleague who throws the INFJ into chaos by declaring, “No time for philosophy—just FIX IT.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly becomes an efficiency dictator, barking orders and moving at warp speed. Their empathetic demeanor is replaced with a fiery “get-it-done-or-get-out” attitude. People are both terrified and impressed, whispering things like, “I didn’t know they had *that* in them.”  



**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Trying to dominate with Te (Extraverted Thinking) while suppressing Ni and Fe is like forcing a poet to write legal briefs—it drains their soul. They start making decisions without their usual foresight or compassion, which leaves them feeling hollow. Over time, they feel like a tyrant in their own mind, with no time to breathe or dream.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear cold, bossy, and overly aggressive, barking orders and shutting down dissent. People who once admired their empathy now fear their rigidity.  

**Antidote:**  
They need to pause the grind and reconnect with Ni’s visionary flow. A quiet brainstorming session or revisiting a creative passion project can help them step back into their natural rhythm. Seeking out deep conversations with trusted friends revives their Fe.  





## **5. INFJ in ISTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Archivist for the Guild of Impeccable Bureaucratic Order*.  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A micromanaging ISTJ supervisor who insists on color-coded spreadsheets and “the way it’s always been done.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ’s mystical vision gets laser-focused on mundane details. They’re suddenly quoting regulations, obsessed with timestamps, and holding others accountable for not following protocol. It’s as if their inner monk was swapped with a bureaucrat who lives for filing systems.  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
The INFJ becomes a slave to Si (Introverted Sensing), focusing obsessively on details and routines. This crushes their big-picture thinking and makes them feel stifled, as if they’re trapped in a dusty library of rules. Over time, their creativity withers, leaving them apathetic and exhausted.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem overly rigid, nitpicky, and dull. People may comment that they’ve lost their spark, becoming oddly obsessed with trivialities.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must break free of routines and do something spontaneous—like a road trip or an art class. Reengaging with abstract ideas, like reading philosophy or exploring symbolism in art, helps reignite their Ni.  



## **6. INFJ in ISFJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Traditional Ceremonies Officer for the Ancient Order of Family Values.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A nurturing ESFJ boss who piles them with communal responsibilities and makes emotional guilt an art form.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ morphs into the office caregiver, baking cookies and organizing baby showers. They’re no longer vision-casting but reminiscing about “the good old days.” People start asking, “Why are they *so* nostalgic all of a sudden?”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
While Fe feels natural to the INFJ, over-relying on Si dulls their vision and traps them in nostalgia. They start clinging to tradition or past patterns instead of imagining new possibilities. Over time, they feel stagnant, like a caretaker stuck in a time loop.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear overly sentimental, deferential, and stuck in the past. Their once-profound insights are replaced with shallow platitudes.  

**Antidote:**  
A creative reset is necessary. Experimenting with futuristic ideas or engaging in visionary planning can help them escape the Si rut. Physical experiences like visiting a new city or redecorating their space can refresh their perspective.  




## **7. INFJ in ESTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Field Marshal of the Department of Getting Things Done Yesterday.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A no-nonsense ENTJ manager who expects every decision to be backed by “actionable results.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ, once the poetic dreamer, is now pacing the office with a Bluetooth headset, yelling about KPIs and budgets. They ditch their vision boards for flowcharts and start saying things like, “This isn’t personal—it’s business.”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Operating in Te overdrive while ignoring Ni and Fe feels like being a drill sergeant in a symphony—they lose all sense of nuance. They become rigid and authoritarian, bulldozing emotions and ideas in pursuit of tangible results. Over time, they feel like a hollow shell of their empathetic self.  

**External Signs:**  
They’re abrupt, impatient, and overly critical. Their usual grace is replaced with sharp edges, leaving others wary and disconnected.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must step back from leadership roles and reengage with creative, soulful pursuits. A trip to a museum, a meditation session, or diving into a fantasy novel can rekindle their Ni-Fe balance.  



## **8. INFJ in ESFJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Master of Ceremonies for the Festival of Perpetual Togetherness.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A bubbly ENFP co-worker who pulls them into every happy hour, team-building exercise, and group chat.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ, once so private, is now organizing potlucks and posting inspirational quotes in the office Slack. They’ve become *that person* who knows everyone’s birthday and signs emails with “Warmest regards.”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
While Fe comes naturally to the INFJ, putting Si (Introverted Sensing) in the driver’s seat forces them to fixate on traditions, social expectations, and maintaining the status quo. This crushes their Ni’s visionary power and leaves them emotionally fatigued from constantly managing others’ needs. Over time, they feel like a shallow performer, unable to dream or think beyond immediate relational dynamics.  

**External Signs:**  
They become overly focused on appearances and social niceties, seeming superficial or overly concerned with trivial matters. Their typical depth feels strangely absent.  

**Antidote:**  
To recover, the INFJ needs solitude to reconnect with their Ni. Engaging in future-focused journaling or planning sessions, as well as stepping out of social obligations, restores their sense of self. Symbolic activities like meditating with candles or creating a vision board can help them regain their focus.  




## **9. INFJ in INTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Philosophical Systems Analyst for the Institute of Endless Theories.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A brilliant but detached INTP mentor who challenges every thought with, “Yes, but *why?*”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ starts zoning out, furrowing their brow, and spewing out abstract theories that leave everyone’s heads spinning. They stop asking, “How does this impact the team?” and start asking, “But does this concept *hold water* logically?”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Forced to rely on Ti (Introverted Thinking) and Se (Extraverted Sensing), the INFJ begins to operate like a hyper-logical problem-solver, detached from their intuitive and emotional core. At first, they enjoy the practicality, but over time, they feel hollow, like a robot on autopilot. Their inner world of meaning and connection starts to fade.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear pragmatic but emotionally cold, overly focused on solving technical problems. People notice their warmth has disappeared, replaced by a mechanical demeanor.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must reignite their Ni and Fe by engaging in storytelling or deep conversations. Artistic hobbies—like writing poetry, painting, or analyzing symbols—can help reawaken their sense of meaning.  



## **10. INFJ in ENTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Idea Wrangler for the Think Tank of Limitless Chaos.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ENFP boss who keeps shouting, “There are no bad ideas!” while juggling five projects.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly has boundless energy, throwing out crazy ideas at rapid speed. Their colleagues are both excited and disoriented, wondering, “What caffeinated whirlwind possessed them?”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Overusing Fi (Introverted Feeling) and Se (Extraverted Sensing) feels unmoored for the INFJ, who is naturally wired to process meaning through Ni and Fe. They become overly focused on personal experiences and sensory pleasures, losing touch with their visionary ideals. Over time, this creates a sense of existential dread—life feels fleeting and without direction.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem overly indulgent or obsessed with aesthetics, appearing self-absorbed or disconnected from deeper concerns. Others might say, “They’re not as profound as I thought.”  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must reengage with their purpose by exploring symbolic or spiritual frameworks. Activities like reading philosophy, stargazing, or reconnecting with a mentor can help them rediscover their Ni-led sense of direction.  




## **11. INFJ in ISTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Emergency Mechanic for the Apocalypse Response Unit.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ESTP teammate who shoves tools into their hands and says, “No time to think—just fix it!”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ’s ethereal calm vanishes, replaced by hands-on practicality. They’re suddenly solving tangible problems with zero fuss, leaving colleagues to marvel, “Who knew they could *do* that?”  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Operating in Se (Extraverted Sensing) and Ti (Introverted Thinking) is exhilarating at first—like driving a race car on adrenaline. But as they suppress Ni and Fe, the INFJ feels untethered, reactive, and eventually burned out. Over time, they lose their connection to long-term vision and relationships, spiraling into impulsivity and shallow distractions.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear reckless, thrill-seeking, and overly focused on short-term gains. Others might comment that they’ve become unpredictable or emotionally distant.  

**Antidote:**  
Reconnecting with their Ni requires stillness. Meditation, yoga, or even a solo retreat can help them reset. Reflecting on past insights or journaling about long-term goals reestablishes their sense of purpose.  




## **12. INFJ in ISFP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Artisan-in-Residence for the Temple of Sensory Bliss.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ESFP co-worker who drags them to improv night and says, “Feel it in your *body*.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ starts talking about textures, colors, and the “vibe” of everything. Their coworkers are stunned to see them finger-painting during brainstorming sessions.  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Living in Se (Extraverted Sensing) and Fi (Introverted Feeling) forces the INFJ to focus entirely on the present moment and personal desires, which feels unnatural and ultimately exhausting. They start to crave meaning and connection but are stuck in a cycle of sensory overload. Over time, they feel shallow, disconnected, and emotionally raw.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear fun-loving but scattered, overly focused on entertainment and material pleasures. Their usual insightful demeanor seems absent, replaced by a performative vibe.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ needs to step away from sensory distractions and reconnect with their inner world. A long hike, deep conversation, or working on a symbolic art project can help them reengage with their Ni-Fe framework.  













## **13. INFJ in ESTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Action Hero Consultant for Extreme Crisis Management.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A thrill-seeking ESTP boss who tosses them into chaos with a shrug and a grin.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ trades their deep introspection for adrenaline. They’re suddenly sprinting into action and making snap decisions, leaving their team muttering, “What just happened to their whole *vibe*?”  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
While Ne (Extraverted Intuition) might seem similar to Ni, the INFJ feels scattered and overstimulated by endless possibilities. Forced into Ti logic, they start overanalyzing ideas, leaving no room for their usual depth or emotional resonance. Over time, this creates a sense of chaos and disconnection from their intuitive anchor.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem playful but unfocused, constantly bouncing between ideas without committing to anything. Others might see them as “all talk, no action.”  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ needs to simplify their mental space. Focusing on one meaningful project or practicing mindfulness brings clarity. Writing down their long-term visions and reflecting on their emotional connections to these goals restores balance.  



## **14. INFJ in ESFP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Director of Flashy Fun for the Society of Spontaneous Joy.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ENFP who declares, “Let’s make every day a party!”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ’s calm demeanor transforms into an explosion of energy. They’re laughing loudly, dancing in hallways, and convincing everyone to “live in the moment.”  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Living in Ne (Extraverted Intuition) and Fi (Introverted Feeling) overwhelms the INFJ with too many possibilities and self-reflection. They feel like they’re chasing a million dreams but achieving none. Over time, they become scattered and emotionally exhausted, longing for the focus and harmony Ni and Fe provide.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear whimsical but flaky, jumping from idea to idea without follow-through. Their usual grounded presence seems replaced by flightiness.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must prioritize by listing their core values and long-term goals. Grounding themselves through physical activity or quiet meditation helps reset their focus. Symbolic practices, like tarot reading or vision journaling, also reconnect them with Ni.  






## **15. INFJ in ENTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Overlord of Strategic World Domination Initiatives.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ENTJ boss who says, “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly takes charge, barking orders and exuding raw power. Their once quiet intensity becomes the stuff of legend, leaving colleagues muttering, “I didn’t know they had a *take-no-prisoners* mode!” 

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Living in Te (Extraverted Thinking) and Ni (Introverted Intuition) feels unbalanced. The INFJ becomes hyper-focused on efficiency, neglecting Fe’s need for connection and harmony. Over time, they feel like a dictator—effective but emotionally barren and disconnected from their usual idealism.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear domineering and impatient, pushing others too hard and shutting down emotional conversations. Their compassion is replaced with a cold, results-driven demeanor.  

**Antidote:**  
Reconnecting with their Fe involves helping others through empathetic listening or volunteering. Creative, heart-centered activities—like painting or crafting—allow them to soften and rediscover their natural balance.  





The INFJ is a psychological shapeshifter, molded by circumstance and provoked by colorful characters who demand transformations they didn’t know they had in them. 

Each shift, though temporary, is a testament to their adaptability—and a little peek into the chaos of their inner world. 

After all…

**We aren’t merely just chameleons.**

*but living mosaics of refracted light, transformed with the grace of sunlight filtering through stained glass, morphing seamlessly between gem-like tones*

*shimmering, color-shifting marvels, rippling like liquid prisms, reflecting every hue of the rainbow in a hypnotic, fluid dance*

*a vibrant spectacle of nature's palette, glistening like oil on water, swirling with metallic greens, fiery oranges, and luminous purples*

*radiant beings of perpetual metamorphosis, gleaming like molten opal, shifting from deep indigo to molten gold with each subtle movement*

*masters of illusion, glowing with an ethereal brilliance, blending like a living aurora borealis against our surroundings*

*dazzling enigmas, mirroring a kaleidoscope’s heart, scattering infinite shards of light and color with every turn*

*spectral wonders, pulsing with a symphony of iridescence, we carry the essence of galaxies within our shifting hues*

*fantastical creatures of light and shadow, cloaked in a shimmering cascade of ever-changing jewel tones, like a dream painted in motion…*



**However…**

For the INFJ, being undercover in another MBTI type for **too** long is like wearing a costume that slowly becomes a cage. 

The antidote is always tied to their Ni-Fe pairing: introspection, meaningful connections, and symbolic creativity. 

By intentionally engaging with these functions, they can shed the mask and return to their true selves—deep, visionary, and empathetic.  


## **Edited to Add:**

## **RELATIONSHIP VERSION**

### **1. INFJ in INTJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
An ambitious, emotionally distant ENTJ partner weaponizes the INFJ’s vision, accusing them of being “too idealistic”—berating their insights as impractical:  
- “Your plans are fantasies. Stick to what works.”  
- “We need results, not ideas.”  

The INFJ feels their intuition strangled, turned into a tool for someone else’s cold, strategic empire. Their inner world shrivels under constant demands to “be logical, not emotional,” leaving them questioning their worth.  

### **2. INFJ in INFP Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
An emotionally turbulent ISFP or ENFP partner shifts focus to their own feelings, criticizing the INFJ for not being “authentic enough” or “too focused on everyone else”:  
- “Why don’t you just *feel* what you feel instead of fixing everything?”  
- “You’re always performing—what about your real self?”  

Torn between their Fe-driven desire to connect and forced introspection, the INFJ feels dissected under a magnifying glass they never asked for.  

### **3. INFJ in ENFJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A socially dominant ENFJ or ESFJ partner showers them with affection—conditional on the INFJ’s constant positivity. Vulnerability or solitude is met with passive-aggressive guilt trips:  
- “Why are you being so negative? Everyone looks up to you!”  
- “You’re letting people down when you retreat like this.”  

The INFJ feels drained, their depth suffocated by relentless expectations to inspire and entertain.  

### **4. INFJ in ENTJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
An ESTP partner treats them like a crisis manager, demanding swift solutions to emotional or logistical problems while disregarding their need for reflection or empathy:  
- “Stop overthinking it—just fix it!”  
- “Feelings don’t matter—what’s the plan?”  

The INFJ is plunged into a cold, action-oriented mode, their nuanced insights ignored. They feel like a soulless machine in a relationship devoid of warmth.  

### **5. INFJ in ISTJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A hypercritical ISTJ partner insists on rigid rules, traditions, and routines, nitpicking the INFJ’s tendency to think outside the box:  
- “Why can’t you just stick to the plan?”  
- “All your abstract ideas are a waste of time.”  

The INFJ feels suffocated, their visionary thinking dismissed as impractical. Creativity and idealism are stifled by a gray world of monotony.  

### **6. INFJ in ISFJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A guilt-tripping ESFJ partner manipulates them into endless caregiving and adherence to outdated traditions, weaponizing their Fe:  
- “If you loved me, you’d do this for me.”  
- “This is just how things are done—you can’t change it.”  

Trapped in a cycle of self-sacrifice, the INFJ’s transformative visions are crushed by societal and relational expectations.  

### **7. INFJ in ESTJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A domineering ESTJ partner demands constant productivity, shaming the INFJ for their introspection and abstract thinking:  
- “You’re wasting time daydreaming—focus on what matters.”  
- “Stop being so sensitive. Get things done.”  

Their inner world is dismissed as irrelevant, forcing the INFJ to abandon soulful reflections to meet relentless, efficiency-obsessed demands.  

### **8. INFJ in ESFJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
An overly social ENFP or ESFJ partner pressures the INFJ into constant group activities, making them feel selfish for craving alone time:  
- “Why can’t you just enjoy the moment like everyone else?”  
- “You’re so stuck in your head—just go with the flow!”  

Their deep need for introspection and privacy is trampled, leaving them emotionally overstimulated and disconnected from their inner self.  

### **9. INFJ in INTP Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A detached INTP or INTJ partner intellectualizes emotional exchanges, belittling the INFJ’s feelings with cold logic:  
- “That doesn’t make SENSE—your emotions are irrational.”  
- “Stop being so emotional and think critically.”  

Yearning for connection, the INFJ feels invalidated. Their natural empathy is treated as a flaw, leaving them questioning their instincts.  

### **10. INFJ in ENTP Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A chaotic ENTP partner forces the INFJ into a whirlwind of debates and unpredictable decisions, mocking their need for stability and depth:  
- “Why do you have to take everything so seriously?”  
- “You’re no fun when you overanalyze everything.”  

Destabilized and disoriented, the INFJ struggles with the lack of intentionality, their visionary focus shattered by the chaos of their partner’s antics.  

### **11. INFJ in ISTP Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
An emotionally distant ISTP partner ignores the INFJ’s bids for connection, dismissing their insights as irrelevant to the “real world”:  
- “Why do you always have to talk about feelings? It’s not practical.”  
- “Just let it go—it doesn’t matter. I’m over it.”

Feeling abandoned and unseen, the INFJ’s natural depth and vision are brushed off as pointless abstractions.  

### **12. INFJ in ISFP Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A self-absorbed ISFP or ENFP partner shifts every conversation to their own emotions, accusing the INFJ of being too controlling:  
- “Why can’t you just let me be myself?”  
- “Stop trying to fix everything—it’s suffocating.”  

Fe is weaponized against them, leaving the INFJ helpless and misunderstood as efforts to connect are rejected.  

### **13. INFJ in ENFP Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
An erratic ENFP partner overwhelms the INFJ with emotional drama and a constant stream of ideas, accusing them of being “too rigid” when seeking grounding:  
- “You’re stifling my creativity!”  
- “Why can’t you just go with the flow?”  

Pulled in a thousand directions, the INFJ’s visionary focus is shattered by their partner’s unrestrained energy.  

### **14. INFJ in ESTP Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
An adrenaline-seeking ESTP partner pressures the INFJ into constant action, mocking their introspection as laziness:  
- “You’re too slow—just do something already.”  
- “Why do you overthink everything? Live in the moment!” 

Dragged out of their natural rhythm, the INFJ is forced into a fast-paced existence that feels shallow and meaningless.  

### **15. INFJ in ENTJ Clothing**  
**Cognitive Assault:**  
A power-hungry ENTJ partner demands perfection, berating the INFJ for any perceived weakness:  
- “Stop being so sensitive—weakness doesn’t get results.”  
- “You’re holding us back with all this emotional nonsense.”  

The INFJ’s heart and vision are crushed under relentless expectations, leaving them feeling like a failure for simply being themselves.  

Each assault targets the INFJ’s core traits—intuition, empathy, and vision—forcing them into roles that betray their nature. Healing requires rediscovering their authentic self through solitude, reflection, and meaningful connection.  





*Oh, and a word of warning to all the trolls—self-appointed arbiters of nuance, brandishing reductive judgments and wielding your tired rhetoric like dull axes:*

**Read the tag on this post.**  

## **IF you’re not an INFJ and have nothing of substance to add, kindly move along.**

I’m well-acquainted with every invective hurled at INFJs; your recycled critiques are as unoriginal as they are uninspired. 

Spare us all the tedium.

To reduce an ingenious survival tactic—crafted by evolution itself—to mere LARPing? 

That’s not just ignorance; it’s the tragic hubris of a limited belief system trying desperately to assert its relevance. 

The chameleon does not ""pretend""; it *thrives*. Its iridescent dance is not a costume but a masterpiece of adaptation, a hymn to survival in a world that demands creativity over conformity. 

The dismissal of such brilliance reveals far more about the critic than the criticized. Projection, after all, is the cheapest form of self-revelation.  

To call out ingenuity as fraudulence reeks of envy—envy of that which the troll fears they lack: versatility, resilience, the audacity to *shine*. 

**For to criticize what one cannot comprehend often stems not from insight but insecurity.**

*And so, trolls, consider this a warning wrapped in a gift: Your barbs are less cutting than illuminating. Each baseless critique serves only to mirror the confines of your own imagination.*

*Be wary, for the sting of your envy burns brighter than the spark of any fleeting insult you might conjure.*

*Grow. Adapt. Evolve—or stay hidden in the monochrome shadows of irrelevance.*"

If you checked entries last year, maybe the title seems familiar. This is an original story I've been working on for a while now, with me sharing a chapter on the previous contest. After getting some criticism and realizing that... well, that it sucked, I decided to restart from scratch. In this new version, I decided to write a prologue, which is this chapter here (and which only currently exists here), mostly depicting my FL's life BEFORE getting Isekai'd, with the rest of the story transcurring in the other world. I hope you enjoy, and feel free to provide any feedback you desire.*

# Prologue: Honrar la Vida

A day destined to become forgotten, like many before. A day of which no stories tell.

“Why now…”

To the sound of a buzzing alarm, her day began. Her arm clumsily reached for her phone, desperate for escape from its endless roaring. In the process, cups and boxes that cluttered the table were knocked to the ground.

“Shut up already…”

At last, she succeeded in calming her phone down. Her eyes remained set on her pillow. It was a simple act of muscle memory what allowed her to turn off the alarm without so much as staring at the screen.

So used she was to this daily war, a tug-o-war between the world of her dreams and that of her reality.

“Of course. I guess it was only a dream. I’m still dumb old Elena.”

Her room was littered with junk. Plastic bags, volumes of Manga, soca cans—even a long-unused guitar, mocking her with its very presence. Her bedsheets too had fallen to the ground; her body lay on her bed’s bare mattress. The built-up odor was enough to poison a small animal.

Ashamed of what she’d become, Elena sighed deeply. Immediately afterward, now with full consciousness, she added, “If I read quickly, I have time for a chapter or two.”

A few quick taps on her phone’s screen later, the world surrounding her seemed to vanish. So engaged was she, in the story unfolding before her eyes.

…okay, “engaged” was perhaps not the correct word.

“Yep, there we go. The love interest said she’s ‘interesting’. About time.”

The plot unfolded not unlike many other stories she’d read before. A tale about some girl who was transported into the world of a novel she’d read after she died. But Elena was unbothered by the unoriginality—if anything, she embraced it. Through the power of storytelling, all her worries seemed to disappear, and she could escape into a world of magic and romance.

“God, I wish that was me,” she voiced out loud, cursing the state of her life. She glanced briefly at the clock on her wall. “Okay, maybe one more—”

“María Elena!”

*Aw Crap, full name time. She must have been trying to wake me up for a while,* she thought.

The one who called her name was her mother. Not wanting to be on the receiving end of her wrath, Elena quickly hopped off her bed. She grabbed the shirt and jeans that smelled the nicest—or rather, the least bad— and threw them on, before storming out of her room towards the kitchen, where her mother awaited her.

—Or so she thought.

Laying on the table was a glass of milk, with some cookies plastered about on a small plate. Her mother appeared to have prepared her breakfast, then returned to bed.

“What a relief,” said Elena, as she sat by the nearest chair. As quick as her throat allowed, she gulped down the milk and chewed on a few of the cookies. The milk had the exact amount of sugar she liked, a sign of her mother’s attentiveness. In record time, she was done with breakfast, ready to face the challenges the day had in store.

At great pace, she got up and headed towards the door. She grabbed her keys and unlocked the door. She was not exactly eager for a day of work, but Elena wore a smile on her face. Because at the very least, the day was off to a good start, as she hadn’t had to face—

“Nos vemos.”

*Dammit.*

She’d been too slow.

Right before she was about to leave, her mother’s mellifluous voice managed to reach her.

“Te quiero.”

Ever since the two of them emigrated from their birthland, her mother’s words seemed to have a different tune to them. Perhaps because she was the only person Elena interacted on the regular who spoke Spanish. Or perhaps because, ever since that day, her mother’s words were suffocating; so pure, so earnest in their love, that Elena could not answer to them, for she was unworthy of doing so.

Indeed, Elena slammed the door as she left the apartment without so much as a whisper for a reply, not even daring to glance back.

Regret seeped in immediately. The saliva that flowed through her mouth had a bitter taste. But there was no turning back. Nothing to do. For she could not face her mother in her current state.

—She was not a daughter worthy of her mother’s grace.

She dashed down the stairs, feeling a chip on her shoulder with every step. She made her way outside the building’s entrance, feeling the penetrating rays of the sun for the first time in what felt like forever.

“Okay Elena, focus.” Elena tapped on her cheeks. She didn’t want to dwell on the past anymore. “Time to head to work. I almost got fired the other day, but today’s the day I turn everything around!”

Full of confidence, she raised a fist toward the heavens. Just because life was on a downward spiral didn’t mean she had to give up. So long as she remained alive, she possessed the power to overcome her struggles.

All she needed to do was walk a few blocks to her right, where her workplace was located.

Knowing that, she turned her body right. She took a deep breath as she felt the beaming sunshine pouring on her, steadying her body for movement.

And so, wearing her conviction on her chest, she—

—turned around and headed the opposite way.



“12:50. 12:51.”

Elena stared at her phone, which lay on the table before her. Right beside it was a greasy, uneaten hamburger accompanied by some fries. Although she’d ordered the food, she had very little desire to actually eat it.

“12:52.”

Instead, she simply counted the minutes that went by. Each time the minutes went up, her eye twitched a bit, while a burning sensation overtook her chest. Regardless, she couldn’t remove her sight from the phone’s clock. The passage of time was simply too palpable, too overbearing to simply ignore.

“It’s 12:53. Maybe if I take a cab I can still make it in time. Or at least not late enough to get fired.”

Her words were pure malarkey, and she was fully aware of that. She’d been warned time and time again by her superiors that skipping work one more time would be the last straw.

Elena knew that. She understood that.

And yet, there she was. Sitting at a burger joint, watching time tick away. Indifferent to the responsibilities being an adult entailed.

“1:00 PM! Welp, I guess there’s nothing I can do anymore.” She clapped her hands while smiling. “Might as well get started on my lunch.”

She reached out for her food. The burger was composed of two slices of meat and an entire ocean of cheddar. Not a single ounce of lettuce could be found. It was a meal designed in a lab to be as unhealthy as possible.

“I hope this kills me,” she snarked.

Before she could take her first bite, her ears caught wind of a conversation taking place by the table to her right.

“The problem with this country is all these lazy immigrants!” said an old gentleman wearing a turtleneck sweater. He was talking to a woman who appeared to be his age, presumably his wife.

Chatter abounded in a fast-food restaurant like that. There was no reason for the man’s words—anyone’s words, really—to stand out in that cacophony of voices and noise.

All the same, Elena felt her heart being pierced by carefully-aimed arrows.

“All they do is leech off hard workers like us,” the man continued.

“That’s not true,” Elena muttered under her breath. She wished to deny the man’s assertion, but she knew she had no power to speak. She was the last person on Earth who could prove him wrong, for she was the personification of the sin of Sloth.

Elena put the burger back down. The hunger that once reigned over her stomach had vanished. An indescribable emptiness took its place.

She was a leech. A beast who only took, never gave. The very burger that stood before her required an animal’s life to be made. Worst of all, she paid for it with her hardworking mother’s funds, for her lazy self left her with no salary to call her own.

Her existence was a stain on the world. Were she to be gone, then surely—

“Miss, are you gonna eat that?”

A brittle voice broke her out of her contemplation. Blue eyes as pure as crystal stared up at her. A little girl, no older than eight, was who’d asked that question. She wore rugs for clothes, and her feet were bare. Her body lacked mass, her black hair was disheveled, and her arms appeared frail. It was clear with just one glance that the girl was either homeless or at least dirt poor, left with no choice but to beg for food.

“Could I take the fries?” the girl asked, her voice drenched in innocence.

Elena glanced at her meal momentarily, before fixing her eyes back at the girl.

“Take everything,” Elena answered.

“Huh?” The little girl tilted her head. It was evident such generosity was uncommon.

“Grab it. And hurry up, you don’t want an employee catching you.” She 

“Thank you, miss,” said the girl, smiling widely. She grabbed the boxes containing the burger and the fries, and then rushed out of the store.

“That’s the least I can do for all of you,” Elena whispered.

As she handed the hungry girl the tray with the food, bittersweetness abounded within the confines of Elena’s heart. The way the girl’s face lit up, knowing she would not have to endure hunger for that day, was enough to make her feel proud of herself, proud of being a woman who shows kindness to those suffering.

At the same time, an inescapable powerless beat at her chest.

That girl was not unique. All throughout the world, millions—no, hundreds of millions—of kids had to face the day, not knowing if they’ll get to sleep with their bellies full. Some of them even had to work to bring food to their tables.

She was powerless to help them—

Actually, she was less than powerless. She, in some ways, contributed to their problems. Every single resource spent keeping her alive was a resource denied to someone else.

It was a great unfairness, that she, slothful to the point of sinfulness, was given so many opportunities. Her mother was far from rich, but she always provided a roof and a bed for her. She was given access to higher education. She never experienced hunger or thirst.

“I’m so sorry…”

She sat there in silence, wallowing in despair over a world she could not change.

She was powerless to do anything else.



“She married the Duke of the North and lived happily ever after. Good for her.”

Elena had just finished the final chapter of the story she was reading. Much as she wanted to snark at the predictability, she could not deny that her heart was fluttering all the same. In some ways, she preferred it that way; the warmth of a happy ending was the kind of escapism she sorely needed at this time, when her days felt so cold.

Literally cold. She was shivering, as a result of blustering winds.

“I wasn’t expecting it to be so cold today. In fact, I don’t think anyone was, not even the weather forecast. Mom would’ve urged me to bring a sweater.”

She was sitting by the edge of a bridge, her feet dangling over the river below. Observers may find it odd for her to stroll so far out just to read on her phone, but it was a ritual that Elena found comforting. The orange light of the setting sun intertwined beautifully with the reflection of the blue water. Outside the occasional car behind her, noise was hard to come by. Sitting there, it was easier for her to forget her troubles and immerse herself in what she was reading.

“...”

Although…that might not’ve been her only reason.

“It would be pretty deadly if I fell from here,” she said to herself, staring down at the potential fall. Despite always sitting this close to the void, only now had the reality truly sunk, how easily she could fall and die. If anyone snuck behind her and pushed her off, her life would be over.

“It’d be like that one story, where the female lead gets pushed to her death at the beginning.”

Elena closed her eyes, and began to kick the air with her feet. The cold touch of the wind, which before was suffocating, now felt pleasing, while its whistling felt like it was cheering her on, somehow

“Would that even be so bad, though?” she said, in a joking tone.

After all, the stories she enjoyed the most involved a heroine who, after her death, was reborn in some foreign, fantasy world. Once there, the entire world seemed to revolve around the heroine: romantic interests orbit her like the moon orbits the Earth. Then, the heroine, through a combination of looks and smarts, not only finds love, but fixes any problems present in her new world.

“Wouldn’t that be nice? To be whisked away, to a land of romance and adventure”

Of course, she lacked in the aforementioned looks and smarts. Her body was quite fat, and her face was full of acne. And when it came to intelligence, well…to say she peaked in elementary school would be putting it lightly.

But that was the power of fantasy. If she were to one transported to another world, then surely, the world would bend to her whims all the same. She’d find love. She’d build a just society.

—She’d have the power her current self lacked.

“AHHHHHH!”

Slowly, without even realizing it, she’d been sliding off the railing she was sitting on. The wind was urging her forward, pushing her toward her demise.

“Nonononono!”

Regret set in immediately. She tried to catch something, anything, with her flailing arms. But it was pointless.

—The cruel, cold arms of death had already gotten their grip on her.

Gravity took hold, and her body began to plummet. She stared at the heavens, inching ever further and further away from her.

The gap in time between the beginning of her descent and the moment her back made contact with the water felt eternal. But it was not. The impact came suddenly and swiftly. The bones of her head shattered in an instant, inflicting immediate, agonizing pain.

This was it. She couldn’t swim. The water was already filling her nostrils. She was drowning. Soon enough, she would die. She would experience death.

It was strange. Drowning was said to be a traumatic experience. A dismal fate, perhaps the worst death of all. But instead, it felt comforting to Elena, who simply shut her eyes as her body sunk further and further into the depths.

*I just hope Mom moves on.*

That was the last thought her mind conjured before shutting down for good.

—The final thought of one who had embraced death.



This is a story about a girl who died… and then died again.

Then again. Then again.

A girl who struggled senselessly against forces far above her. Who thought she could challenge death.

How do I know this? Because I saw it. Every memory, every feeling, I was there. Watching.

Who am I? Ahh, that would be a spoiler. I think it’s better if we figure it out slowly. Together.

So then, let us begin. Let me narrate to you this story.

—The story of a girl powerless to change the world.



She awoke—no, saying that would be inaccurate.

She was in a state not dissimilar to sleep—but it was not sleep.

Words were tools used by mortals to describe the world that surrounded them. Therefore, no word could truly describe the state she was in, for it defied mortal comprehension. It should not be something one simply *awakes* from.

—She opened her eyes, soon after experiencing death.

“Where am I? Last thing I remember…” she muttered, struggling to get up from the ground. Her head hurt, and her knees were weak.

She was in an alleyway, darkness surrounding her from all sides. All sides, except right in front of her; blinding light seeped into that dark corridor. Sounds of human chatter also assaulted her ears. Her senses were overwhelmed to the point of making her want to cry, like a newborn baby. 

Left with no choice, she stumbled toward that light—

“What… the… Fuck!”

—and all new colors revealed themselves before her.

The street before her was ripped straight out of the Middle ages. The pavement was made out of stone. No cars traveled the roads; vehicles that resembled carriages in aesthetic passed her by, albeit lacking in actual horses. The men surrounding her were outfitted in tunics and the women in long gowns, not a pair of jeans in sight. Buildings consisted of basic stone and wood.

“I can’t believe it…”

She’d been ripped out of her reality. And yet, she recognized this situation immediately, her heart about to jump out of her chest.

“I’ve been reborn in another world!”

So no, I am not a Giovanni, I am a Relicta.""
semen donor's eyes are filled with tears, hurt, and regret. My words seem to have hit pretty close to home.
""Princessa, I am so......"" I don't bother to listen to his half hip apology.
—
Bianca's POV
I woke up at exactly four the next morning as usual. I quickly wash my face, pick workout cloths and head downstairs.
I was hoping the kitchen would be empty but I was out of luck. Andrea, just the person I wanted to see first thing in the morning. He was also dressed in gym clothes and was making a protein shake.
I silently walk in the kitchen and sat on the bar stool. Andrea is still busy with the shake. Some mafia man, doesn't even know what's going on in his surrounding. I could easily kill him right now and he won't even know who it is. Which I might just consider after recalling his words from last night. Unfortunately it's only us here and it doesn't take a genius to put two and two together. I'll just have to scare him to death.
It's time to mess with him.
""I like mine cold so can you add some ice in it."" Before I finish speaking, Andrea jumps violently and drops the whole container, a very non-masculine scream coming out of his mouth. His hand moves below the kitchen island and my years of honed reflexes help me duck the bullet like it was nothing. When he catches sight of me, his jaw hits the ground.
Soon I hear running footstep on the stairs and all the biologicals burst in to the kitchen in a vast range of disarray. All of them holding guns or knives. I see my twin awkwardly holding a gun and hiding behind her brothers.
When they all look around and spot the bullet in the wall behind my head and Andrea holding a gun, everyone's faces redden in anger, everyone except Sofia who quickly walks out from behind their bulking frames and stood to the side trying to twirl the gun in her hand and look prick.
Keyword Trying.
She looked like someone fumbling with a too hot potato. And she didn't even have the safety on. She will be taking someone's brains out. And I hope that someone is Andrea.
Before anyone can regain a small part of their long lost intelligence, I ask the question that makes them all go pale.
""Why did you shoot me!?!? I was lucky to duck at the last second. Who did you think it was!?!? And why are you all holding guns and knives?""
I wanted to burst out laughing at their pained expressions but kept my angry face on and glared at them until Alessandro stepped forward and cleared his throat.
""We....uh, we have them for......protection."" He said and winced at how much of a pathetic excuse it was.
""From?"" I ask, raising an eyebrow.
""From.......anything and everything."" He said, the lie still sounding lame.
Before I could reply, semen donor rounds on Andrea.
""Why did you shoot your sister?""
""She is not my sister."" Andrea spits with disgust. Do I care? Not one bit.
""Now that's besides the point dear brother,"" I say mockingly, seeing his face redden in anger. ""You are just trying to buy your hip some time.""
""She ambushed me!!"" He whines like a five year old.
""I asked you to add some ice in my protein shake."" I reply in an innocent tone, pouting. I hear a few snickers behind me.
He opens and closed his mouth like a landed fish. After some time, he regains his ability to speak and says, ""Make your own."" With that he storms out of the kitchen.
semen donor rushes to me and tries to pat me down for any injuries but I slap his hand away with disgust evident on my face and say in a voice laced with venom,
""Do not touch me.""
I see the hurt and regret flash in his eyes but I couldn't care less. I start walking out of the kitchen at a leisurely pace but Sofia steps in front of me blocking my path. I raise an eyebrow at her.
""How dare you try to ambush Andrea?"" She screeches. I rub my ears with a grimace, seeing her turning even more angry at the action.
""It's not my fault that he is such a dumb bimbo to not know who's standing behind him and jumps and overreact at their voice, is it?""
Ignoring my question, she says, ""You tried to kill him!!"" She shouts, making me rub my ears again.
She raises her hand to try and slap me but I grab her wrist effortlessly, turning her around and pushing it up her back, I slam her face first into a wall. She lets out a ear piercing scream. I bend down to her ear and whisper so only she can hear,
""Now now dear twin, did I not tell Daddy Dearest to not touch me? But it would seem that your teeny tiny brain could not decipher that it was meant for all of you. So let me repeat myself dear sister, do not touch me or else you will not have any hands left to try it a second time. As for your accusation, it is untrue for mainly two reasons, the first being that if I wanted to kill Andrea, he'd be dead, as he is not, that means I didn't try to kill him. And the second being that if I wanted to kill him, I will not do it from behind like a coward, I will stand in front of his face and let him see his death in my eyes, in the eyes of the weak sister he abused and abandoned. I will stand in front of him to see the fear in his eyes when his realizes that his wounds are beyond healing now, when he realizes that there is no going back, when he realizes that his end has come. I would stand is front of him to see the light dull in his eyes, to see them droop with exhaustion, to see them glaze over when death enfolds him in its embrace. I would stand in front him to enjoy every second of the life leaving his eyes. And I would happily witness and be the cause of yours too, so don't play with fire if you are not ready to burn.""
With that I let her go, she was crying and shivering in fear. All the brothers rush towards her. semen donor shouts at me to come back and apologise to my sister, but I just flip him the bird without even looking back. I walk into the gym and start my exercise. I know Sofia won't repeat any of that to the biologicals because she is too much of a coward.
After three hours, I went to my room to shower and get ready. As I stood under the hot water, I thought
I made Andrea screech like a little girl, made the biologicals uncomfortable about their weapons and got to slam Sofia into a wall and made her almost pee herself. And as a bonus I even got to show semen donor my middle finger.
It's just 7:30 in the morning and the day already started out so productive.
I get out of the shower and pick the first thing that's in my bag which happens to be a plain white sweater dress. I pair it with knee length brown heels and a black watch. Once I have strapped on my weapons, I walk downstairs.
Everyone except Sofia is sitting on the table. I plop down on my chair and start scrolling through today's news. I was reading an interesting report on the mining of cryptocurrency when I was disturbed by the sound of heels clicking on wood. I look up to see Sofia standing in the doorway wearing a very........bold outfit. Its baby pink in color.
Maybe she is obsessed with pink like I am with planes?
It was a two piece set, the top revealing quite a lot of her cleavage. The skirt is tight and reaches her upper thighs. It has two belts with heart shaped buckles. She was wearing pink louboutin heels and pink tinted sunglasses.
""You look beautiful princess."" Andrea says to Sofia, probably to rile me up.
""Thank you An."" Sofia said pecking his cheek softly. Both of them turn to see my reaction but I had already moved on and was reading a news report on the increasing shares of Rel and Co.
I could tell both of them were irritated by my lack of jealousy. Just them the maids entered the room and started putting plates of Full English breakfast in front of us. The smell was mouthwatering and the taste was even better.
I was just finishing my Earl Grey when semen donor's phone rang. After talking in a hushed tone for a moment he pulled the phone away for a second and asked,
""Were anyone's cars being delivered today?""
""Finally, yes mine."" I say.
""Not even here for a week and already using daddy's money for buying cars for yourself?"" Sofia screeches. Honestly my ears are going to start bleeding.
""Daddy could go stuff his money where the sun doesn't shine. Those cars are mine, bought from my money."" I say in a bored voice, scrolling through the news again.
Before Sofia could reply, Andrea shouts,
""You will not talk about dad like that!""
""Oh I am sorry if I wasn't disrespectful enough. Let me rephrase, daddy could go stuff his money up his hip. That better?"" I ask still not looking up from my phone.
Andrea and Sofia rise from their seats trying to make me cover under their glares. I look up from my phone to see their express and immediately best out laughing.
Both of them turn purple with anger. I don't pay them a second glance and turn to semen donor and tell him to put the cars in the garage. After we finish breakfast we head to the garage and I almost hear everyone's jaws drop at the sight of the new additions.
Marco steps towards one of my cars and says,
""Where did you get this model, its not even out yet?!?! I have been trying to get this for ages!""
Perks of owning the company.
I was perfectly content with my existing cars, it was Ash who had gotten the car for himself but he had fallen in love with the design that had ordered one for each of us and said that the car would 'add some flair to our meager boring collections'.
Before I could reply, Andrea spoke up,
""The manager must have given it to her as payment for opening her legs.""
Before I could stop myself, one of the knives strapped to my body was flying. It landed in the wall right between Andrea's legs. It caught a bit of his pant but did not draw any blood.
Just as I had wanted.
His face had gone pale and he had true fear in his eyes. They say that men only think with their shafts but I also believe that they ultimately only think about their shafts.
""Go on, call me a bimbo again. I would love for the next knife to land 5cm to the north."" I say in barely more than a whisper but everyone in the room heard me. The silence was so absolute that you could hear a pin drop in the next city.
I look at Andrea expectantly. He gulps audibly and says through gritted teeth as though the words are physically hurting him.
""I am sorry.""
""Good, so aren't we going shopping?"" I say excitedly. Let them see the bipolar bimbo I am.
I get in the car Marco was fangirling over and start the engine, making it clear that I will be riding alone. The rest of them file into three cars and we arrive at the Rel and Co. mall of the city after a 20 minute drive.
We move to the all brand area and I start picking cloths. Sofia is also shopping, it looks as though the mall won't be left with anything remotely pink by the time she is done.
I am done before Sofia so when I go to the counter for the payment, semen donor takes out his card but I handed mine to the cashier first. semen donor glares at me but I look at him with a blank expression and say,
""You can pay but I will burn all the cloths bought from your money and then I will have to go back to the mall and shop everything again, so save me the trouble and yourself the money.""
semen donor's eyes fill with anger but he bottles it up. Good for him, I don't want my cleaning team scraping his guts off the mall floor all morning. They have more important work to do.
""In whose name should I make the bill?"" The cashier asks.
""Bianca Relicta.""
""Bianca Giovanni.""
Me and semen donor say at the same time. We both glare at each other.
""You are a Giovanni."" He says, authority oozing from his voice. It would have made most men piss their pants.
Its a good thing that I am not most men.
""I was never a Giovanni, I never have been and I never will be. You think that I would give anything to be a part of the multi millionaire family like all the golddiggers who want to marry you and Alessandro. You couldn't more wrong. But you know the best part? I thank god everyday that I am not a Giovanni. That I am not a part of this abusive family. I may have Giovanni blood. But blood can seep away with a single cut and this family gave me many. So no, I am not a Giovanni, I am a Relicta.""
semen donor's eyes are filled with tears, hurt, and regret. My words seem to have hit pretty close to home.
""Princessa, I am so......"" I don't bother to listen to his half hip apology. I turn to the cashier and collect my card and hand all the bag to semen donor. If he is going to be in my presence, he might as well be useful.
After 2 more hours, semen donor pays Sofia's bill and all of us move to the food court for lunch. I order a cheeseburger and chocolate shake. Sofia starts talking about some stilettos she bought.
Just then Alessandro's phone rings, he picks it up and start talking in Italian, no doubt to keep the conversation from me.
""Parlare."" His voice is filled with authority.
(Speak)
""Che cosa?!?! Chi era?""
(What?!?! Who was it?)
""Perch il governo dovrebbe interferire con la nostra spedizione?""
(Why would the government interfere with our shipments?)
Interesting. The government and mafia always stay separate and not interfere in each others work. If the government is breaking the unspoken agreement then we could be at war.
""Va bene, ne discuteremo in modo pidettagliato quando arriver al magazzino.""
(Okay, we'll discuss this in more detail when I get to the warehouse.)
Alessandro hangs up and gives the others the, we will talk later look.
Just as we finish eating, my phone rings. I move to the corner of the hall and answer it.
""Qu'est-ce que c'est Ash?""
(What is it Ash?)
""One of our New York shipments have been stolen, the men who were left alive say that it was the military.""
What!?!? Have all the governments decided to move against the mafia?
""Idem avec les Italiens.""
(Same with the Italians.)
""I will put out some feelers and see what's happening in the other mafias.""
""Vous faites cela. Je te parlerai plus tard.""
(You do that. I will talk to you later.)
""Bye.""
I hang up as the biologicals make their way towards me.
""Got everything you needed Princessa?"" Angelo asks.
""Yes."" I reply curtly, turning on my heels and marching out.
Once we reach the house, I get in my room and start scrolling through the political news. About half an hour later, something catches my eye.
The last UN meeting ended on the evening of 24th of march but all the representatives went home on the evening of 25th. And non of them were spotted anywhere in New York the whole day, in fact, non of them came out of their hotels. Strange.
Just as I was about to call Ash, my phone signals text.
Its a video from Ash. I put on my head phones and click on play.
Its an hour long. When it finishes, I take off my head phones in a daze and the only thing I can think of is 
""Sh1t."""

Stupid tipping culture in Hyderabad - just a rant ,hyderabad,1gwe9jy,2024-11-21 06:39:36,552,0.96,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1gwe9jy/stupid_tipping_culture_in_hyderabad_just_a_rant/,-Alphaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,AskHyderabad,"Update 1- the restaurant name is AnTeRa (Gachibowli)! I have had similar experiences at Le Vantage, Exotica Banjara Hills recently and many more in the past! 



Why are restaurants training their staff to force  guests to tip irrespective of the service and food . Some try to make you feel guilty and some make you go mad.
Even after politely refusing many times they come back with nonsense reasons.
I went to a good restaurant today and the bill was close to 6k. They asked me to pay 5% tip (300 rupees) which I refused and said I will pay in cash whatever I want so remove it from the bill. The manager started making me feel guilty and shit. But finally agreed to remove it from bill. Now comes new drama - I was trying to pay using Zomato and all of sudden he takes the bill away from me and says if you are paying through Zomato tipping is mandatory! I was like wtf - he goes by “you will get 10% na sir so pay this”.  I was speechless with this logic and started talking in the tone he understands! 
Finally paid the bill and left the place without paying any tip (sorry but my mood was off because of their stupid arguments) …

Chinese Nicknames for Trump and Harris特朗普和哈里斯,LearnChiense,1goymvf,2024-11-11 13:03:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnChiense/comments/1goymvf/chinese_nicknames_for_trump_and_harris特朗普和哈里斯/,HuiChinese_Linda,,"  
[https://www.youtube.com/@huichinese.lindahuang](https://www.youtube.com/@huichinese.lindahuang)

In this video, we dive into the interesting world of Chinese nicknames for two well-known American political figures: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. In Chinese-speaking communities, nicknames for public figures are often creative, humorous, and sometimes even sarcastic, reflecting a blend of language play and cultural insights.  
  
Donald Trump’s Chinese Nicknames  
One of Trump’s most popular nicknames is 川建国 (Chuān Jiàn Guó), which translates to “Nation Builder.” “川” (Chuān) is derived from the phonetic translation of Trump, while “建国” (Jiàn Guó) means “nation builder.” This nickname is a humorous take, joking that Trump is a “secret agent” whose actions indirectly benefit China. Another playful name is 川宝 (Chuān Bǎo), or “Precious Chuan,” using the affectionate term “宝” (Bǎo) or “treasure” sarcastically.  
  
Trump’s third nickname is 懂王 (Dǒng Wáng), meaning “King of Knowing.” This was inspired by Trump’s famous line, “Nobody knows more than I do,” often used when he claims expertise on various topics. Additionally, his standard phonetic translation in Chinese, 川普 (Chuān Pǔ), is sometimes humorously twisted into 床铺 (Chuáng Pù), which means “bed,” further playing on the sounds of his name.  
  
Kamala Harris’s Chinese Nicknames  
Kamala Harris’s formal Chinese name is 贺锦丽 (Hè Jǐnlì). “贺” (Hè) is chosen for its phonetic resemblance to Harris. “锦” (Jǐn) means “beautiful fabric,” and “丽” (Lì) means “beautiful.” Together, her name evokes grace and elegance, but there’s a lighter, more playful side to how Chinese speakers refer to her. Fans often call her 哈哈姐 (Hāhā Jiě), where “哈哈” (Hāhā) means “laughing out loud,” and “姐” (Jiě) means “big sister.” This nickname, “Haha Sister,” reflects her upbeat and positive public persona, conveying warmth and friendliness.  
  
Each nickname reflects a unique perspective on these public figures, mixing phonetic translations, puns, and cultural humor. Chinese nicknames often blend language with popular perceptions, making these names more than just translations—they’re expressions of personality and public opinion.  
  
So, which nickname is your favorite? Join us in the comments to share your thoughts on these creative nicknames and learn more about how language and culture intertwine in Chinese-speaking communities.

The ronin chapter 1 ( i think),creativewriting,1gn492l,2024-11-09 01:46:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1gn492l/the_ronin_chapter_1_i_think/,Samantha_cool,Novel,"I haven’t made chapters yet since this is still a work in progress but i just want feed back on some of my writing😭 also at first she was supposed to be a guy and in first might not have changed ever single pronoun or thing correctly sorry if you struggle to read 


The ronin 

Her long black hair flows down her neck and protects it from the beaming sun. She was above average height and fairly toned. It was hot, nearly scorching the sun directly above her  in the sky, no clouds in sight. she could feel her face burning. The metal chain shackled tightly around her legs and arms that kept her captive trapped under the sun. she hears the sound of a whip cracking hard behind her. The guard in leather armor was the one who made the noise as he used the violent lash of his whip to keep us moving. He struck down an old man, a straggler. “He was too slow to keep moving”, I heard the soldier say . Their enemies from the west are ruthless brutal soldiers with a leader who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted complete and total control. The  imperial infantry had been at war with them for many years. This lethal army was known for their fighting tactics that were deemed inhuman by all who saw them in battle.
I was captured while doing mercenary work to make decent coin. It was just enough to get food and lodging. I had been caught during a lengthy battle, ultimately captured by the cowards who tortured me now.. as time went on we eventually reached one of the hosho castles they had many set up all over the nation mostly were captured from minor rulers and turned into war camps were generals or higher ups and even those close to the hosho king would take heed and train their own selective armies 
Once we entered the castle we were taken to the jails were i was thrown in it was weirdly freezing down hair i wasn't sure how but it was a nice change from the burning summer weather the only items in the cell was a bucket and a pile of hay and a tiny roze in the middle of the room i stared at it for a moment before deciding to lay down in the hay i covered myself in the hay the clash of warmth and cool air making me feel nice and comfortable i fell asleep in an instant i see visions of my family murdered and bleeding all over our houses floor my fathers sword missing from its mantle me sitting there useless and helpless a fire starting to grow in the corner of my eye i stand up covered in my family's blood i walked out of the house and laid in the field far away from the fire staring at the stars i awoke to a person's face infront of mine and a blade at my neck i stared blankly at the face that was in front of mine
I awoke from my nightmare in a cold sweat the jail cell colder than before now it truly felt like winter i was freezing i looked around the cell and saw nothing a knock on the wooden cell door came through i stood up and backed up to the wall preparing for anything the leader of the castle walked in the 8th general in the hosho army the weakest and the dumbest but still a formidable opponent nonetheless. 
Me and him have fought a couple time although he ran away before the fight began cowered behind his soldiers “hmhmhm finally got you in my grasp” he said with a grin “i should have killed you the second i found out you were in my keep kenshi takamura” i shot daggers with my eyes at the sound of my name”so why didn’t you kill me” i said with an annoyed look. “Well you see my soldiers tend to get a bit bored and morale drops so i've set up a bit of a game my best soldiers will battle you and who ever kills you will be crowned by second in command ” he said and how are you so sure that they will be able to kill me” i said with a cocky but curious smile “unless im bound and have no weapon im not gonna die so easy” i said raising my hand and making a swinging motion
The general smiles “ your wounded yet you still think you can beat my men you haven't even bested me in battle ” he walks up to me and grabs my hair in a firm grip”this is the end for you girl and i for one can't wait to see you  dead and bloodied ” he grins his face angers me so i strike him blood on my fist  and i see a tooth fly out  “i hope that was worth it ile make sure my men will do  10 times worse than what you just did”.
He walked out of the cell and locked the door i layed down in the hay it was freezing and the hay poked me and the ground was uncomfortable nonetheless it makes me feel some warmth i fall asleep and begin having that same night mare family dead sword gone fire burning laying in the field and the sword in my face it was Damascus 
 odachi a large katana like sword  , a golden hilt ,a black grip, and gold and blue scabbard with a snake coiling around, it on the blade hilt and scabbard I notice my family's insignia my eyes light up as i realize this is my fathers  sword   the man in front of me was the man who killed  my family my eyes glazed over with rage a burning sensation filled my chest i strike the man's leg he drops the blade it clatters to the ground a ring runs through  my ears i grab the blade by the handle i black out as i see the man lunge towards me i feel something land on my hands and face it was cold and wet i opened my eyes to see the man impaled by the blade through his chest his gasp for air filling the silent night a red streak coming from his chest and running down the blade. I followed the stream down to my hands realizing that cold wet feeling was the blood of the man in front of me it didn’t bother me all i cared about was avenging my family i tore the blade from his chest it was heavy and much much larger then i was i lifted it up above my head i struggled to keep the blade above my head i saw the fear in the man's eyes as i rose the blade with one motion and swung the blade down in sliced through his chest with ease i stared at him i grabbed my fathers sheathe i wiped the blood off the blade and sheath the sword. I woke up once again to keys rattling in the door it opens up once again the general walks through “well well well today is the big day  my guards will come pick you up soon enjoy what little time you have left “ he smiles as he walks out” .the guards walk in and grab me they put me in shackles and brought me down to a large wooden door the general stands there holding my fathers sword my sword “ i am a man of respect i will at least allow you to fall in battle with your own weapon” i grab the sword and strap it to my back i stare at him as he walks out.
The wooden door opens and I walk out to the sun's grace. The warm air kisses my face in such a comfortable embrace. in front of me i see a large man wearing some minor leather armor he is wielding a spiked tetsubo its still bloodied the blood dried up on the wooden handle and metal spikes the large bat like weapon lowered in a resting position he has a white demon mask blood stained hand scraped up judging by the state of his weapon and his attire i could tell he has some battle experience i walked up to him he was considerably taller then i was we stared eye to eye  for a moment before he backed away and raised his weapon prompting to me to unsheathe my sword i get into my stance holding my blade in front of me it feels heavier than usual most likely due to my lack of energy and my wounds not being able to properly heal.the man charges at me his weapon risen high i run forward as well bracing my body for the heavy blow i will need to block.as we meet in the center of the arena are weapons clash sparks fly out as the metal spikes on his weapons scrape across my blade. a vibration runs down my arm making my bones shake and tremble. I feel as though my wrist will snap.i quickly pull back my blade sparks fly as the metals scrape together  as i pull back i spin my body around so that my body's momentum can carry my blade as i am incapable of doing so due to my bodys current state with all my might i swing my blade towards the man he blocks it in such away that leaves mostly the spikes on his weapon taking the full force of my weapons blow, most of the spikes crack and shatter he kicks my leg and i fall to one knee my sword drops down he archs back his weapon and swings it full force into my face it launches me back a considerable amount i look up blood gushing from my nose i see my sword on te ground next to the man i get up quickly i ran at him as fast as i can in my injured state he rises his tetsubo  preparing to strike my head i roll past his weapopn as it striked the ground as iroll i pick up my weapon i hear him struggling i assumed his blade has gotten stuck in the ground i spin once more to carry my blade i see the back of his eck once i turn the blade is on a direct course towards his neck it hits his neck with the full force and momentium of my body the blade passes through his necvk with almost effort my only thought being how fooish of him to not wear any armor to protect his neck his head flies off a fountiaain of blood begins to pour out from ewhere the mans head used to be my blade and face get covered almost like a shower of blood it remided me that i havent bathed in nearly 5 days i see two guards run up to the mans body and carry it off. I heard a clap from the viewing stands then followed by more claps and more “SILENCE” the general yelled ”failure couldn't even beat a wounded dog if i must ile do it myself “ he jumps down to me from the viewing area .i stare at the general blankly
As He removes his coat revealing metal armor it has lion heads on its shoulders and his helmet is that of a lion he reaches behind his back and pulls out a giant hammer the metal looks fresh not a dent on it either he just got it today or he has never been in a fight to test it out. A wooden handle , also fresh and undamaged,was a much different weapon from the one he usually used, a long sword with a red handle I didn't see on him. 
He struggles to lift it as it's too big for someone of his size to handle. My suspicions were confirmed. He never used a weapon like this before and he went into a  fight against the man who killed his best soldier; he truly was the dumbest.” 
I raised my blade, “ general where's your usual weapon huh i think that hammers to big for your feeble body.” 
“ Shut up boy, you know nothing of me!” he replied.
He runs at me hammer raised in the air he goes to strike me with his hammer before it connects i side step the hammer i grin at him as i see him struggle to pick the hammer back up he tried to swing the hammer at my side i dodge it again the weapon going to slow to even be a concern to me the weight of the hammer tosses him to the ground he quickly rises and reaches for something by his side i wasn't sure what it was but all i saw was something fly towards my face i tried dodging it but it grazed my cheek i begin to bleed  and before i knew it the general was running at me with his sword in tow it was a crude blade a long sword with a serrated blade and a red handle with a spike at the bottom a sword fitting his size. He took my distracted state as a optunity to hit me he swung his sword towards my neck i blocked the blade nearly hitting my neck he pulls blade back and tries to thrust into my chest i push my blade into the sword pushing it down into the ground it gets stuck into the dirt ground i kick his arm cuasing him to let go of the blade i see terror in his eyes he begins to turn around he’s trying to runni wont let him not this time i strike his leg with the tip of my blade the only place not protected by arm his tendont gets sliced and blood begins to gush from his leg he tried to limp away i trike his other leg a deep cut forms i see his bone popping out of the cut he fall to the ground i hobble over to him he turns to me “p-p-please have mercy “ i raise my blade struggling to rise it i have lost much energy from this encounter i strike it down into his head cracking open his skull and splitting his head in two i remove the blade from his skull i wiped off the blood and sheathed the blade.I hear a crash  yelling and the sound of horse hooves aproaching all of a sudden 6 horses chrash through the wooden door i came through there being ridden by metal armor at the front of the charge is what i presume is the leader of this group they are wearing a black cape there armor was mostly black and grey there right shoulder peices covered in spikes they left one having a insignia of a wolf there helmet was that of a skull holes in the eyes and what looks like sword strikes gathering around the helmet showing battle experience they stare at me then at the generals body then back at me i stand there covered in blood they continue to stare on, halted on there horse there soldiers are behind them on there own soildiers about 5 men that i could see but i hear swords clashing and yelling in the distance i wasnt sure what there intentions were but i wasnt gonna take any chances. I draw my sword ready for whatever might come next. They stare more before hopping off their horse as far as I could see they had no weapon on them. My first immediate thought was they were concealing it somehow like how the general was before they started to walk towards me. My eyes grow heavy as the person approaches and i start to get woozy i still try to hold my blade but my eyes grow heavier and my arms feel weaker i drop my blade and my body follows the last thing i see before my eyes shut is the mysterious horse rider walking towards me.i see a light its growing brighter and brighter i see a person there back turned to me i look down i'm now standing in the light i approach the person i see what looks to be my father ahead of me i tap him on the shoulder he turns around to reveal it wasn't him no what stands in front of me was the person who captured  the camp i was they stare at me before pushing me back i fall into light i fall and fall then it all turns to darkness i keep falling. I wake up in a dark tent there's nothing besides a wooden stool and a desk bandaged up feeling pain and fatigue no more i run my hand through my hair its no longer in a bun my hand gets caught on multiple knots i remove the blanket that's over me i see clothes ahead of me on a wooden stool they were simple cloth garbs a brown shirt and brown pants i put on the garbs and walked outside the light was blinding. My eyes adjusted to the light after a few seconds. I saw many tents surrounding the area. It was all set up in a random field. I'm not sure exactly where I am. I see many people walking around and talking i begin to wander around trying to figure out where i am or who that horse rider was or who these people are as i walk around i feel a tap on the shoulder i turn around to see a large strong man he had short brown hair and a scar across his right cheek he had a serious look on his face his mouth opened then he spoke with a deep growl  “the boss wishes to see you come with me”who are you?” he turns around without answering and begins to walk off “huh ok tough guy” i followed him to a hill there on the top was a person riding a horse and wearing  a black cape armor  mostly black and gray a right shoulder piece covered in spikes the left one having a insignia of a wolf there helmet was that of a skull ,holes in the eyes and what looks like sword strikes gathering around the helmet my heart began to race i felt fear i wasn't sure why but the person in front of me caused fear in my heart my legs began to shake my hands followed the person turns their head to face me there helmet burns an image into my brain my fear grows my chest begins to feel tight and my breathing grows more sporadic i'm not sure whether to run or try to fight all i know is i need to do something. They  lower their head and put their hand up to it. They remove their helmet and look up. I see a  beautiful woman with long brown hair. She has a scar across her right eye, just barely missing her eye. Her eyes are two different colors one blue one brown she stares at me. So how was your sleep she said with a smile. As she said that all the fear and stress I had felt had melted away after realizing she wasn't trying to kill me”how long did i sleep for?”I spoke with a worried look. “About 4 days we really thought you were dead when you first passed out but seeing as your walking i assume you slept good”.i didn't know what to say it had been 4 days since we first met my body's was in horrible shape i blame that damn general i decided to speak.”who are you why did you save and most importantly where is my sword!” although i was calm at the start i became more angry as i spoke especially when it came to my sword”. She walks around to the right side of her horse  i hear a click and then a snap she walks back around to where i am she is holding my sword.”here”she handed me my sword i picked it up i felt a warmth fill me”t-thank you”.she smiles “now as of where you are your in my camp were a group of mercenaries called _____ and i saved you because you seem strong and strength is useful to me you did kill that general we got paid much for that any more questions?”i stare at her i look back at the tents and people walking about i wonder if this is where i really wanna stay for a long time i look back at her”is there any place i could get some armor?” she smiles  grabs my shoulder “ of course” she grabs her horses reed and leads it down i follow her and so does the mysterious man i speak up and say” so what's your name and his aswell” i point at the man with the scar she turns to him. “ oh him he is nagori my second in command  and i am eris the leader of this group”.i looked towards nagori  he looked as serious as the first time i met him i looked back at eris and  spoke.” if you don't mind me asking where are you weapons” she stops moving for a moment she turns and lifts up her hand to show me she has sharpened claw like weapons on her hand there stained with blood” i have these there sharp enough to cut through armor the blood is nearly 2 years old its everyone i've ever killed using my hands” i am astonished by her skill she is amazing “ and what if they have a weapon” 
She stares for a moment then lowers her hand” well the claws are reinforced armor with padding so i can block strikes with them not always the best idea but if that doesn't work”. She moves her cape and and reveals a sword on her back it was a great sword the hilt was spiked the blade was crude with serrated edges it had a sharp tip it was large but still small enough to hide behind her perfectly.”i got this blade i made it myself thats why its very different from most blades but it's served me well in many many battles”she turns back around and continues walking we reach a tent with black smoke flowing out the top we stop right at the entrance eris looks towards me.”this is the blacksmiths tent he will set you up with some armor and a retouch on your sword i gotta get this back to his stable” eris pats the horse she walks aways nagori follows her after giving me a nasty stare i walk into the tent a wave of heat hits me it makes my eyes start to water i walk in clear my eyes and see a man hitting a slab of metal with a hammer sparks fly on each hit.”uhh hello im uh Hikaru Eris sent me”.The man looked up at me and spoke”ah yes Hikaru your armor finished yesterday glad to see you up and about its over there “ he points over to a stand draped over by a black towel covering up the armor.I walk over to the stand i grab at the black towel and began to pull it off. I see a nicely forged armor (Insert armor description here) i pull it off the stand and begin to put it on.”it fits well thank you”I smile at the man he stares back at me.”Nonsense your apart of the ____ now let me see your blade” i unsheathe my sword and hand it to the man. He drags his finger down the edge of the blade checking for any imperfections; he sets it down gently on a wooden table beside him.”Your blade is well made dull though needs to be sharpened “i speak” thank you it was my fathers… how long till it will be sharpened?” He stares at the blade then back at me ""come back in a hour your sword will be finished”i shake his hand”thank you” i turn around and walk out of the tent.i see eris outside waiting with nagori by her side she looks me up and down”the armor looks nice” she says with a warm smile. I walk over to them and Samson stares at me the whole way. “You must be hungry, hikaru , let's get you something to eat,” Eris says while walking away nagori walks with her i follow them both. We come up to a campfire with multiple people sitting around a large pot sitting above the fire in the middle and a man stirs it. Eris points to the man stirring the pot “ this is our resident cook Jiro, he makes an amazing beef stew” he waves at me then goes back to stirring . Eris points again to a woman working on a piece of paper” this is samantha she is our resident cartographer” samantha waves at me the goes back to working on a drawing.Eris points towards another man sharpening a sword” this is jackson he is one of my generals” he turns towards me and walks he shaked my hand” nice to meet you i hope to lead you well in future battles” i smile at the man “ nice to meet you to jackson” he walks back to his sword and continues sharpening.i speak “ im hikaru nice to meet you all”as i finish talking i see Eris walks over to a log and sits down nagori follows her and goes to sit next to her. Eris stops him and speaks” nagori could you do me a favor and go check on hikaru's sword then my horse please” he stares at her then grumbles. He walks away i watch him as he walks away i turn back to the fire eris pats the place next to her i walk over and sit next to her jiro hands us a bowl of stew it's very warm I grab a spoon and start to eat the stew it's been a while since i've had a good mean.” wow this is amazing” jiro smiles at my compliment as he grabs his own bowl Samantha puts down her bowl and speaks”so hikaru what's your story?” I responded curiously “what do you mean?” She chuckles” i mean how did you end up in a arena ,and how did you become such a good fighter, where are you from stuff like that” i sigh after hearing all these questions not exactly sure what to do,eris responds for me” look none of that is important rn all we need to do is celebrate the coming of a new ally” samantha seemed satisfied with this response as she picks up her food. Some time passes as we talk about past battles we've all been in. At some point Nagori returned with my sword. I thanked him but he just walked by me before I knew it. It was night time everyone went back to there tents and eris had showed me where mine was i turned to her before entering my tent” thank you for taking me in this place is nice” eris smiles and responds “ it's not free of course your gonna be fighting for your stay make sure to be ready we have a job tomorrow”i nod before i speak “ i just have a question” she perks up” what is it?” I respond nervously “ well why did you become a leader of this mercenary band “ she laughs “ that's what you were nervous to say?” I respond quickly “ well I didn’t know if it was cause of something bad that happened or not” she quickly responds “ well I the reason why i've done all this was for respect and power  when i grew up no one respected me because i was to week and a girl so i figured the stronger i got the more respect i would get that lead to me getting a group and becoming one of the most feared mercenaries out there… People respect me now.but it's not enough. I still want more power. I want people to know me and fear my very name. ""I chuckle” that's a crazy reason but it's a good one so you're just on a quest for power” she laughs ” yeah basically”. She walks away from my tent and I turn towards my bed. I remove my armor and lay down in my bed. I quickly drift off to sleep. No nightmares approached me that night. I was relieved. Once I awoke I quickly became equipped with my sword and armor. I walked outside my tent and the sunlight nearly blinded me.I the sound of horse hooves approaches me getting closer by the second. The horse approaches me. The rider is fully geared up and ready. She patted the back of the horse signaling me to mount it. I jump up on the horse and Eris strikes the horse with the reeds. The horse lunged forward with incredible speed and ran towards where Eris guided it. We reached where everyone else had been on there own horses it was apparent I awoke late eris turned to me and spoke” sorry you have to ride with me there are no other horses left” I respond timidly” it doesn’t matter as long as i get to where i need to get” she nods she screams out a command” lets go we have money to earn and people to kill!”as she says this eris strikes the horse with the reeds once more causing it to run off all the other soldiers follow they charge off into the hills on there way to their current job after a couple hours of travel they arrive during the night

Feedback required: Type me!,Socionics,1gl8fu5,2024-11-06 15:37:09,5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Socionics/comments/1gl8fu5/feedback_required_type_me/,Green_Ad_9895,Typing,"Fairly new to socionics, so i did a 40q questionnaire.

Feel free to ask follow up questions if any!  
I am thinking Te/Fi and Ni/Se axis but not sure of the positions.

**Section Te :**

**1. How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?**

I either **work** or I do not. I have proclivity towards work which is stimulating and interesting. It happens in bursts of energy - Periods of 11 hours a day every week followed by a month of cricket, not much (unless I have a deadline, this is how I approach it if there was no deadline/athaurity etcetera). ADHD makes it a pain in the Ass. When I do work there is not a lot of structure to it and I do not think much. I just have general plan and general vision of what it should look like. Most people work to survive, though to me it seems like a meaningless existence. Just working like a zombie and waiting to get it over with it sounds like a nightmare that one lives everyday - I am inspired by people who love what they do.

**2. How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?**

Depends on it's objective (can be self defined too) - wether it fulfills it, other than basic objective I also look into what is the \*extra\* value in this. it is the extras that elevate work from normal baseline to better.

[To](http://rules.to/) determine the quality of a purchase -If online I look into reviews, preferably the one with pictures and then I order. But if I am physically in a shop.. I have my eyes and hands and I ask if there is a warranty card etcetera.

**3. There is a professional next to you. How do you know they are a professional? How do you evaluate their skill?**

Watch them do the skill + Portfolio of work plus I evaluate how they talk about it (they do not even have to be  jumpy/nerdy about it). Though..if someone has a good portfolio yet they have a bit of nonchalant don’t care attitude about what they are doing then I may not trust them because that shows lack of dedication. Professionals respect what they do. You do not have to light up like a lightbulb over your work either….but there has to be an energy to it.

**4. If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?**

usually a result of emotional imbalance or conflicting wants…try to heal it.   
  
performance is better or worse than others? . Ok so since there is keyword “other” here …we look at others and grade ourselves relative to others with our metrics of what is good and bad of course. I judge it based on the extras..because usually people have base bare minimum figured out.

**5. How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?**

If it meets the goal I wanted, the job is success, if it does not then it is technically a failure. 

Though with time I have developed a cope for it…. \*It is not a failure but it is not a success either.if that supposed “failure” helps you do better for the next job. .then it was the part of another job all along.\*  
  
Still a failure though honestly.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. **Section Ti :**

**1. What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?**

Wholeness of an object is the consideration of all its elements as a single unit. Inside the whole there may be many parts that work individually… but something as a whole is unified manifestation of individual working and interaction between its [parts.As](http://parts.as/) for the parts.   
  
I can have two groups of orchestras. Each group can have same number of instruments yet they may not give the same “whole”Here I am assuming my parts are tangible physical objects (musicians, instruments)But while writing this I am thinking….what if I consider the intangible (timing, cooperation, harmony) as a part too?in that case parts can be equivalent to the whole - provide you KNOW all the parts, which you probably do not.

**2. What does “logical” mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?**

If it makes sense and if it is consistent…and if I agree with its base assumption. Because every logic has a base assumption/postulate. It should be backed by proof OR reliable facts. Logic is not a one way street. The arrow has to go both ways. You cannot build some bullshit logic which does not match with reality - if It does not then the onus of proof lies on you and every part will be scrutinized by feedback.I think I derive logic from facts and proofs and from things I see around myself and it usually a very general logic like..”power corrupts people because——” and now this nugget is in repository… like a block..I may use it somewhere else.

**3)What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.**

Hierarchy is natural importance/respect/power of one element above the [other.So](http://other.so/) if your manager has enough power to fire you.. he is above you in power hierarchy.Biggest example of hierarchy - Asian society - it is self explanatory, does not even have to be explained.

“Do not talk back to elders” is a form of hierarchy

“Women should be subservient” is a form of hierarchy“

This skin color is more superior” is a form of hierarchy

Hierarchies that breed major injustice are evil and should be abolished. I respect normal hierarchies but that does not mean that they are infallible. As long as they are fallible and can be questioned then it is fine.

**4. What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.**

Classification works by grouping elements that share an attribute in one group/category and that is how it works.  
  
Classification is needed so that I can know about this element by just knowing the category. To group thing that are alike and consequently finding a pattern to it..  these are blocks.   
  
So I know whale is classified mammal so I know that whale has no gills and gives [birth.It](http://birth.it/) is so natural that I am struggling to verbalize why it is important…it is everywhere..it is like trying to describe color. it is applied everywhere. 

**5. Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others’ ideas?**

Though I try to be consistent, I am aware that I am full of contradictions. I twist my ideas to adjust them to my own agenda like everyone else.

How I spot inconsistency is through -contradictions and  looking into the base postulate or sometimes even base “emotion” of that logic. For example base emotion of many conspiracy theories is fear and distrust ..If logic comes from a place of superiority/fear/neediness then…….I do not respect it but i may listen to it if i see merit.

if it is concrete like say - events of a war, conspiracy theories, science..then it should be backed by evidence or  a lot of supporting information that strongly points towards your conclusion. it should not be a one way street of ""oh i just build shit up in my head and have no backing""  or ""I just listen to what people say without thinking.""   
If you respect the subject you are talking about you go both ways.   
  
When I have to go into “definition” of every terms and turn the argument into linguistic fest, I get aggravated because that is just splitting hair... 

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. Section Se :**

**1. Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?**

Yes, by repeating my points, pestering them, or convincing them that their reasoning is wrong.  
  
negotiating etcetera.For some people too much aggression can hurt people's ego and that creates more road blocks and makes them MORE stubborn. It is easier to press a reasonable person than an egotistical person. Though often times people complain that I raise my voice or is too stubborn.

**2. How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?**

I look into ways and options to get it and then chose the best course. if I really want it.. i work for it. 

**3. How do you deal with opposition? What methods do you use to defend your interests?**

I just confront them and ask them wtf bruh let's talk. In that I can be emotional/manipulative/harsh depending on what will work. 

**4. When do you think it’s ok to occupy someone’s space? Do you recognize it**

I don’t think it is wrong to occupy space but I understand that people may not like it, so I expect them to tell me and i will respect it and be mindful. People are responsible for their own boundaries.

**5. Do others think you are a strong-willed person? Do you think you have a strong will?**

Yes most people think I can do anything..which *sometimes* gives me imposter syndrome. I am a bit protective of my will because I see people around me losing their will to the society and I fear that “what if” I get infected too and unknowingly get manipulated.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. Section Si :**

**1. How do you satisfy your physical senses? What examples can you give? What physical experiences are you drawn to?**

eh……? I mean…lot of time I feel what I need but I still don’t do it because it does not seem that important to me. Physical sensations are like background noise to me.I am drawn to camping.

**2. How do you find harmony with your environment? How do you build a harmonious environment? What happens if this harmony is disturbed?**

I do not understand the question? What is harmony?

**3. What does comfort mean to you? How do you create it?**

Comfort Is blanket and fire place?…. And drinking soup while reading a book. Sometimes I create those environments for myself but when i do …i realise I was hyping it too much in my head and it is not that big of a deal. True comfort comes from peace of mind, having a good balance of everything and you create it by growing as a human being

**4. How do you express yourself in your hobbies? How do you engage yourself with those things?**

I express according to what I feel that day.

**5. Tell us how you’d design any room, house or an office. Do you do it yourself, or trust someone else to do it? Why?**

If I have an aesthetic In mind ..maybe a victorian bedroom so I will find all the pieces that give a cohesive victorian look...it is a fun process to look at all the pieces and think of a design.. Sound like a good creative project.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**5. Section Fe :**

**1. Is it acceptable to express emotions in public? Give examples of inappropriate expression of emotions.**

people should be able to express their emotions in public as long as it is not inappropriate or too [dramatic.one](http://dramatic.one/) can state their emotion in a more toned down and calm manner..Like you can look sad and shed 2-3 tears.. but outright crying like a madman is stupid.

**2. How do you express your emotions? Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?**

I have no business laughing at a funeral or crying hysterically at someone birthday. Other than the extreme I do not care.

**Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?**

I can usually tell how.. I just want to live..but I feel bad if others feel bad and they do not deserve it, if they deserve it, then it is fine.

**3. . In what situations do you feel others’ feelings? Can you give examples of when you wanted to improve the mood of others?**

If they describe it and I see it in their face then I can feel extreme empathy and I try to talk them out of it. If I want to improve someone mood I just try to make them laugh or take them out on a walk and drink tea together.

**4. How do others’ emotions affect you? How does your internal emotional state correlate or contrast with what you express?**

they do affect me more if those people hold some weight to me. What I feel is what I express. If I feel annoyance…it will show on my face….and I try to hide it. I have low control over my facial expressions..so if I feel something intensely even though I would not want to show it…it will show somehow and people will catch up on it fast.and subconsciously I THINK I want to show it…because *I want people to know*, especially if they have disappointed me because it is easier for me to hide sadness than hide other emotions.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**6. Section Fi :**

**1. How can you tell how much emotional space there is between yourself and others? How can you affect this space?**

huh…???? Well they telling me emotional things so they probably trust me and I just act on the moment..idk how do I effect it..i effect it by being a listening ear and nodding.

**2. How do you determine how much you like or dislike someone else? How does this affect your relationships?**

dislike many things in people so I can tell what I like in people - Honesty/drive to be better/funny/wise/strong.. I hate copey and spineless people.

**3. How do you move from a distant relationship to a close one? What are the distinguishing characteristics of a close relationship?**

you just get close with time and talk.. in a close relationship they listen to you and you listen to them and they stay long. Oh yeah both feel understood. Feeling understood is very key…and willingness to communicate

**4. How do you know that you are a moral person? where do you draw your morality from? Do you believe others should share your beliefs on what’s moral? Why?**

I score low in morals in big 5, yet I think I am very moral because most of my morals come from high sympathy for other people, respect for peoples volition/choices and basic society standard. I think I am very moral, Everyone should be moral on basic ..very basic things.. because those morals may help the society function in a just [manner.so](http://manner.so/) base morals of - be kind, be honest, be unbiased, be justice oriented should be followed.. these are base… everyone should have these basis or this world will become law less. I detest people who do not follow “obvious” morals ( especially if it harms someone else for no reason).

To me, the purpose of morality is to reduce suffering, run a society and harbour a safe environment.

**5. Someone you care about is acting distant to you. How do you know when this attitude is a reflection of your relationship?At first**

Usually I do not realise they are being distant..until they become **too** distant that anyone can see it, I was not sure if I was distant with my friend until other people hinted that..  
then I felt neurotic that maybe I was insensitive AGAIN..but honestly..just ask them why, what happened. People can have tough phases.. and If i realise that the problem is ME yet they don't tell me that it is me..then I kill the relationship. fuck it.

People should be vocal rather than just being distant out of nowhere. what am I? A mind reader?

**7. Section Ne :**

**1. How can you tell someone has the potential to be a successful person? What qualities make a successful person and why?**

they have drive and resources to do so. Maybe their parents are rich and they are driven.inner strength makes a successful person

**2. Where would you start when looking for a new hobby? How do you find new opportunities and how do you choose which would be best?**

if something looks beautiful and captivating to the point I think..damn I wanna do this.

**3. How do you interpret the following statement: “Ideas don’t need to be feasible in order to be worthwhile.” Do you agree or disagree, and why?**

feasibility should be one of the metrics to measure an Idea but lack of feasibility does not make it completely useless - just less likely to succeed. Maybe with adjustments or time it will be feasible some day.

**4. Describe your thought process when relating the following ideas: swimming, chicken, sciences. Do you think that others would draw the same or different connections?**

huh…. Ok....  What? Swimming.. chicken .. bird…a birth that swims …. Duck.....duck has webbed feet so it floats because SCIENCE. I think people would think the same because it is pretty straight forward.

**5. How would you summarize the qualities that are essential to who you are? What kind of potential in you has yet to be actualized and why?**

Humane, Just, honest, driven, sharp..  potential yet to be actualized?? - Freedom.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**8. Section Ni :**

**1. How do people change? Can you describe how various events change people? Can others see those changes?**

People usually do not change at base level, only their toppings change but pizza base remains the same.People change with time, experience and feedback… but only at surface level MOST of the time.those who change and undergo serious metamorphosis are rare.

**2.  How do you feel and experience time? Can time be wasted? How?**

Time passes slowly when you are kissing someone.. time passes slowly when you are doing a plank..yet it passes very fast when I see my small sibling grow to my height.we cannot control how time passes around us…the most we can do is to just do it justice and live it to the fullest.Time can be wasted definitely.. but it depends on what you consider valuable - productivity? Time with family? Eating good food?  But it can be a waste..to me…mindless puppet actions are a waste of life..not even time.. but life is more than time.

**3. Is there anything that cannot be described with words? What is it? If so, how can we understand what it is if language does not work?**

of course..a lot of time, different words from other languages can describe something your language could not describe and that itself is a proof…. When you don’t have words for it…you make it a poetry.. that is what art is.because when you have no singular word..you have to be creative with how you express it..art is war waged against ineffable beauty…

**4. How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldments in your environment?**

It needs a fundamental understanding of causality and that comes from observation and patterns, .you have to notice first and let the pattern develop.. ultimately you would know what will lead to what in what situation… and sometimes you just know

**5. In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?**

In every situation…a time to act is right when it will give the most optimum result.  though I am not good at it but I know that it is important.but…I do not like to wait to0o much…..I am the type to watch videos in 2x speed.  I think I “know” when the time is right..yet I struggle to implement it. I am either too lazy to strike when the iron is hot OR i strike before the iron is hot.. But while striking I DO know about the iron..yet i take the wrong action."
Typing help 🙃,SocionicsTypeMe,1ghcodk,2024-11-01 14:43:16,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocionicsTypeMe/comments/1ghcodk/typing_help/,Green_Ad_9895,,"Fairly new to socionics, so i did a 40q questionnaire.

Feel free to ask follow up questions if any!  
I am thinking Te/Fi and Ni/Se

**Section Te :**

**1. How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?**

I either work or I do not. I have proclivity towards work which is stimulating and interesting. It happens in bursts of energy - Periods of 11 hours a day every week followed by a month of cricket, not much (unless I have a deadline, this is how I approach it if there was no deadline/athaurity etcetera). ADHD makes it a pain in the Ass.When I do work there is not a lot of structure to it and I do not think much. I just have general plan and general vision of what it should look like.Most people work to survive, though to me it seems like a meaningless existence. Just working like a zombie and waiting to get it over with it sounds like a nightmare that one lives everyday - I am inspired by people who love what they do.

**2. How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?**

Set expectation, if you have to submit it, you have to know what is expected from you. If it is a personal project you have to know what you expect from yourself. with that expectation you set an outline and fulfil the basic, this is just basic though ..base level.I assume that everyone is doing basic -  it is the extra that stands out. if I am confident in the extra value I am adding I do not hesitate to bend the basic [rules.To](http://rules.To) determine the quality of a purchase -If online I look into reviews, preferably the one with pictures and then I order. But if I am physically in a shop.. I have my eyes and hands and I ask if there is a warranty card etcetera.

**3. There is a professional next to you. How do you know they are a professional? How do you evaluate their skill?**

Watch them do the skill  + Portfolio of work plus I evaluate how they talk about it (they do not even have to be  jumpy/nerdy about it).Though..if someone has a good portfolio yet they have a bit of nonchalant don’t care attitude about what they are doing then I may not trust them because that shows lack of dedication. Professionals respect what they do. You do not have to light up like a lightbulb over your work either….but there has to be an energy to it.

**4. If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?**

find overwhelm or an emotional imbalance…try to heal it. performance is better or worse than others? . Ok so since there is keyword “other” here …we look at others and grade ourselves relative to others with our metrics of what is good and bad of course. I judge it based on the extras..because usually people have base bare minimum figured out.

**5. How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?**

If it meets the goal I wanted, the job is success, if it does not then it is technically a failure. 

Though with time I have developed a cope for it…. \*It is not a failure but it is not a success either.if that supposed “failure” helps you do better for the next job. .then it was the part of another job all along.\*Still a failure though.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. **Section Ti :**

**1. What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?**

Wholeness of an object is the consideration of all its elements as a single unit. Inside the whole there may be many parts that work individually… but something as a whole is unified manifestation of individual working and interaction between its [parts.As](http://parts.As) for the partsI can have two groups of orchestras. Each group can have same number of instruments yet they may not give the same “whole”Here I am assuming my parts are tangible physical objects (musicians, instruments)But while writing this I am thinking….what if I consider the intangible (timing, cooperation, harmony) as a part too?in that case parts can be equivalent to the whole - provide you KNOW all the parts, which you probably do not.

**2. What does “logical” mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?**

If it makes sense and if it is consistent…and if I agree with its base assumption. Because every logic has a base assumption/postulate. It should be backed by proof OR reliable facts. Logic is not a one way street. The arrow has to go both ways. You cannot build some bullshit logic which does not match with reality - if It does not then the onus of proof lies on you and every part will be scrutinized by feedback.I think I derive logic from facts and proofs and from things I see around myself and it usually a very general logic like..”power corrupts people because——” and now this nugget is in repository… like a block..I may use it somewhere else.

**3)What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.**

Hierarchy is natural importance/respect/power of one element above the [other.So](http://other.So) if your manager has enough power to fire you.. he is above you in power hierarchy.Biggest example of hierarchy - Asian society - it is self explanatory, does not even have to be explained.

“Do not talk back to elders” is a form of hierarchy

“Women should be subservient” is a form of hierarchy“

This skin color is more superior” is a form of hierarchy

Hierarchies that breed major injustice are evil and should be abolished. I respect normal hierarchies but that does not mean that they are infallible. As long as they are fallible and can be questioned then it is fine.

**4. What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.**

Classification works by grouping elements that share an attribute in one group/category and that is how it works.Classification is needed so that I can know about this element by just knowing the categorySo I know whale is classified mammal so I know that whale has no gills and gives [birth.It](http://birth.It) is so natural that I am struggling to verbalize why it is important…it is everywhere..it is like trying to describe color.

**5. Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others’ ideas?**

Though I try to be consistent, I am aware that I am full of contradictions. I twist my ideas to adjust them to my own agenda like everyone else.

How I spot inconsistency is through -contradictions and  looking into the base postulate or sometimes even base “emotion” of that logic. For example base emotion of many conspiracy theories is fear and distrust ..If logic comes from a place of superiority/fear/neediness then…….I do not resepect it.

if it is concrete like say - events of a war, conspiracy theories, science..then it should be backed by evidence or  a lot of supporting information that strongly points towards your conclusion. When I have to go into “definition” of every terms and turn the argument into linguistic fest, I get aggravated because that is just splitting hair.

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. Section Se :**

**1. Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?**

Yes, by repeating my points, pestering them, or convincing them that it is the best course of action, negotiating etcetera. Too much aggression can hurt people's ego and that creates more road blocks and makes them MORE stubborn. It is easier to press a reasonable person than an egotistical person.Though often times people complain that I raise my voice or is too stubborn.

**2. How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?**

I look into ways and options to get it and then chose the best course.

**3. How do you deal with opposition? What methods do you use to defend your interests?**

I have one on one argument with each opposition(in case they gang up on me). In that I can be emotional/manipulative/harsh depending on what will work. 

**4. When do you think it’s ok to occupy someone’s space? Do you recognize it**

I don’t think it is wrong to occupy space but I understand that people may not like it, so I expect them to tell me and i will respect it and be mindful. People are responsible for their own boundaries.

**5. Do others think you are a strong-willed person? Do you think you have a strong will?**

Yes most people think I can do anything..which *sometimes* gives me imposter syndrome. I am a bit protective of my will because I see people around me losing their will to the society and I fear that “what if” I get infected too and unknowingly get manipulated.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. Section Si :**

**1. How do you satisfy your physical senses? What examples can you give? What physical experiences are you drawn to?**

eh……? I mean…lot of time I feel what I need but I still don’t do it because it does not seem that important to me. Physical sensations are like background noise to me.I am drawn to camping .. sitting in a nice chair, feeling the wind and eating cup noodles.

**2. How do you find harmony with your environment? How do you build a harmonious environment? What happens if this harmony is disturbed?**

I do not understand the question? What is harmony?

**3. What does comfort mean to you? How do you create it?**

Comfort Is blanket and fire place…. And drinking soup while reading a book. Sometimes I create those environments for myself but when i do …i realise I was hyping it too much in my head and it is not that big of a deal. True comfort comes from peace of mind, having a good balance of everything and you create it by growing as a human being

**4. How do you express yourself in your hobbies? How do you engage yourself with those things?**

I express according to what I feel that day.

**5. Tell us how you’d design any room, house or an office. Do you do it yourself, or trust someone else to do it? Why?**

If I have an aesthetic In mind ..maybe a victorian bedroom so I will find all the pieces that give a cohesive victorian look...it is a fun process to look at all the pieces and think of a design.. Sound like a good creative project.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**5. Section Fe :**

**1. Is it acceptable to express emotions in public? Give examples of inappropriate expression of emotions.**

people should be able to express their emotions in public as long as it is not inappropriate or too [dramatic.one](http://dramatic.one) can state their emotion in a more toned down and calm manner..Like you can look sad and shed 2-3 tears.. but outright crying like a madman is stupid.

**2. How do you express your emotions? Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?**

I have no business laughing at a funeral or crying hysterically at someone birthday. Other than the extreme I do not care.

**Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?**

I can usually tell how.. I just want to live..but I feel bad if others feel bad and they do not deserve it, if they deserve it, then it is fine.

**3. . In what situations do you feel others’ feelings? Can you give examples of when you wanted to improve the mood of others?**

If they describe it and I see it in their face then I can feel extreme empathy and I try to talk them out of it. If I want to improve someone mood I just try to make them laugh or take them out on a walk and drink tea together.

**4. How do others’ emotions affect you? How does your internal emotional state correlate or contrast with what you express?**

they do affect me more if those people hold some weight to me. What I feel is what I express. If I feel annoyance…it will show on my face….and I try to hide it. I have low control over my facial expressions..so if I feel something intensely even though I would not want to show it…it will show somehow and people will catch up on it fast.and subconsciously I THINK I want to show it…because *I want people to know*, especially if they have disappointed me because it is easier for me to hide sadness than hide other emotions.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**6. Section Fi :**

**1. How can you tell how much emotional space there is between yourself and others? How can you affect this space?**

huh…???? Well they telling me emotional things so they probably trust me and I just act on the moment..idk how do I effect it..i effect it by being a listening ear and nodding.

**2. How do you determine how much you like or dislike someone else? How does this affect your relationships?**

dislike many things in people so I can tell what I like in people - Honesty/drive to be better/funny/wise/strongI hate copey and spineless people.

**3. How do you move from a distant relationship to a close one? What are the distinguishing characteristics of a close relationship?**

you just get close with time and talk.. in a close relationship they listen to you and you listen to them and they stay long. Oh yeah both feel understood. Feeling understood is very key…and willingness to communicate

**4. How do you know that you are a moral person? where do you draw your morality from? Do you believe others should share your beliefs on what’s moral? Why?**

I score low in morals in big 5, yet I think I am very moral because most of my morals come from high sympathy for other people, respect for peoples volition/choices and basic society standard. I think I am very moral, Everyone should be moral on basic ..very basic things.. because those morals may help the society function in a just [manner.so](http://manner.so) base morals of - be kind, be honest, be unbiased, be justice oriented should be followed.. these are base… everyone should have these basis or this world will become law less. I detest people who do not follow “obvious” morals ( especially if it harms someone else for no reason).

To me, the purpose of morality is to reduce suffering, run a society and harbour a safe environment.

they have drive and resources to do so. Maybe their parents are rich and they are driven.inner strength makes a successful person

**2. Where would you start when looking for a new hobby? How do you find new opportunities and how do you choose which would be best?**

if something looks beautiful and captivating to the point I think..damn I wanna do this.

feasibility should be one of the metrics to measure an Idea but lack of feasibility does not make it completely useless - just less likely to succeed. Maybe with adjustments or time it will be feasible some day.

**4. Describe your thought process when relating the following ideas: swimming, chicken, sciences. Do you think that others would draw the same or different connections?**

huh…. Ok....  What? Swimming.. chicken .. bird…a birth that swims …. Duck.....duck has webbed feet so it floats because SCIENCE. I think people would think the same because it is pretty straight forward.

**5. How would you summarize the qualities that are essential to who you are? What kind of potential in you has yet to be actualized and why?**

Humane, Just, honest, driven, sharp..  potential yet to be actualized?? - Freedom.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**8. Section Ni :**

**1. How do people change? Can you describe how various events change people? Can others see those changes?**

People usually do not change at base level, only their toppings change but pizza base remains the same.People change with time, experience and feedback… but only at surface level MOST of the time.those who change and undergo serious metamorphosis are rare.

**2.  How do you feel and experience time? Can time be wasted? How?**

Time passes slowly when you are kissing someone.. time passes slowly when you are doing a plank..yet it passes very fast when I see my small sibling grow to my height.we cannot control how time passes around us…the most we can do is to just do it justice and live it to the fullest.Time can be wasted definitely.. but it depends on what you consider valuable - productivity? Time with family? Eating good food?  But it can be a waste..to me…mindless puppet actions are a waste of life..not even time.. but life is more than time.

**3. Is there anything that cannot be described with words? What is it? If so, how can we understand what it is if language does not work?**

**4. How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldments in your environment?**

It needs a fundamental understanding of causality and that comes from observation and patterns, .you have to notice first and let the pattern develop.. ultimately you would know what will lead to what in what situation… and sometimes you just know

**5. In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?**

In every situation…a time to act is right when it will give the most optimum result.  though I am not good at it but I know that it is important.but…I do not like to wait to0o much…..I am the type to watch videos in 2x speed.  I think I “know” when the time is right..yet I struggle to implement it.

AITA for telling my boss she's unreasonable and a terrible communicator?,AITAH,1gexlvr,2024-10-29 11:39:10,3,0.81,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gexlvr/aita_for_telling_my_boss_shes_unreasonable_and_a/,JellyfishBeautiful80,,"This is mostly a vent, and gonna be super long I'm sure. I (M22) have been working for my boss (F46) for almost 2 years now. I knew her through mutual volunteer work before I started working for her, and really only accepted the job because she needed help and I could use the extra cash. My job is split between on call work with the public, and manual labour at a hobby farm. Everything was great for the first year and a bit, there was some growing pains as I learned to do the paperwork side of things (I had zero experience before starting), but generally she guided me through it and I made a few mistakes the first few tries but eventually got it. I'm going to try to be as non-biased as I can for this next bit. I moved the juicy stuff to the top, but I'll keep the context after to explain why tension has been building for the last few months. 

Last night I drafted an email in response to someone filing a complaint. I consciously chose my words carefully and consulted the info I had to make sure I was correct. I added a small blurb at the end to reiterate a point we've discussed with this person before. I decided not to send it because I wanted to confirm with her that it was correct and I wasn't sure it was actually necessary to explain in as much detail as I did. Today she deleted the entire email leaving only the small blurb at the end and sent it with my name as the sign off (I put my name there while drafting). The person then emailed back angrily addressing me by name. I was pissed because I would've never sent just the small blurb, it's a waste of time and we already know this person is aware of it so it's pointless to repeat ourselves. I had enough and wrote her a long message today basically saying hey if you're going to completely rewrite one of my drafted emails, please put it under your name. Or at least change the ""good evening"" to ""good morning"". It could create issues if this email has to be used as evidence and you send it in my name. I explained how I wouldn't have bothered sending it if we're just going to delete the whole point of the email, and she'd known that if she consulted me. I also told her I'm not okay with the fact that I'm now getting yelled at by this person because she used my name. She basically said my draft was entirely inappropriate and I should not be writing emails to people unless I'm confident I know what I'm talking about.... I responded ""Yes, that's why I didn't send it... and it was still a draft. I wanted to make sure it was accurate first."" Like did I not literally do what she said? I wasn't confident so I didn't send it. 

She hated that. It was a bitchy response on my end I know, but I'm so annoyed at this point. 

Blah Blah we discussed some other cases that somehow were also my fault even though she told me not to work on them because we needed to consult by-law first. 

Then she asks if I followed up on one of our large cases. I said no I'm waiting for confirmation email from (Town Employee). She said we received it on the 21st. ??? I went back and checked everywhere in our email. I asked where because I can't find it. She said the information is updated in our system. I looked there too and only saw the notes I added, nothing from (TE). I asked if this is one of the cases she'd been downloading/printing and deleting (we need more space on our account, but she said she was starting with the old closed ones. I never assumed she would close and delete important emails on cases that are still active and happened within the last 6 days..) She said yes. My response was ""Sounds pretty reasonable that I wouldn't know about it then"". She REALLY hated that. Sent me the message ""I think we need to discuss a few things including appropriate responses and work ethics. The defensive and offensive attitude responses to an employer and manager are not working for me. Let me know when you would like to sit down and discuss this. It can be on one of your workdays if you would like. Thank you. "" 

So I said fuck it and responded with ""I think we need to discuss reasonable expectations and proper communication between employees. So far it feels like its been seriously lacking and as a result is being taken out on the employee with the lower power dynamic. We can discuss this at your earliest convenience. Thank you"". She left me on read. Sure, I went over the top at the end. But almost 2 months of her rolling her eyes every time I speak, blatantly adjusting her tone and word choice to be more stand offish and cold (you're doing this today, rather than ""hey can you please do this for me today"" like she'd usually say), telling me I'm wrong if I don't do it and I'm wrong when I do do it, and reminding me that she works 14 hour days and is missing out on her kids growing up because she has to work all day and inferring I should be grateful and suck it up and I can't have anything to complain about because she has it worse.. as if that's my fault?? idk, did I go too far? AITA or was it justified?? I know it sounds like I've been making a lot of excused, but are they excuses if they're true? She's acknowledged in the past that I've been diligent about correct myself when I was doing something wrong. Apparently now that doesn't count. There's a lot more significant events that have happened but this is already a novel so I'll skip it. I would have quit by now but I haven't secured another job yet (trust me I'm applying) and I'm living paycheque to paycheque. I would lose my housing if I lose this job (which honestly she might fire me idk. I don't even think I care at this point). She never addressed how I was supposed to know about an email she deleted btw..  
  
MORE CONTEXT: The last 3-4 months, we've both been getting increasingly overwhelmed with the workload as it's just the two of us doing an easily 4-5 person job. As a result she seems to have increased her expectations with me without being clear (imo) about what it is I'm supposed to be taking on. Like I should be able to read her mind. She's had some volunteers come in (students getting hours), and stated it was to ""help with the work I'm not getting done"". Except the work they're doing isn't something we discussed that I needed to do on a daily basis, I was under the impression they were ""as needed"" jobs. That being said, there were definitely some tasks I had started slipping on so I did need to correct myself there. She has then told me that I shouldn't be doing xyz because she has told the volunteers to do it and she's trying to teach them accountability. At one point i asked for clarification because I was doing work in a room and noticed one of the animals pens was really dirty and needed cleaning. I asked if I should clean it or ask the student to and she said no just leave it. So I stopped doing xyz (washing dirty food bowls, cleaning crates as they become dirty, folding bedding/towels for kennels, etc). Then she called me into a meeting about 3 weeks later and said she's not impressed with me being in the way doing other chores when the animals hygiene needs to come first (the exact thing she told me to leave so she could direct a student to do it. Which they did a few minutes later). TBF I had been organizing the room so I did have things everywhere which made it harder for the students to get through but by no means impossible. She also said that I haven't been a ""self starter"" by just doing the things that need to be done without direction (cleaning bowls, doing laundry, cleaning cages). I tried to explain that she told me not to do these things because they were for the students, to which she says I should only leave them if she specifically told a student to do it and they haven't. Which is so confusing because I'm not supposed to be in the main building when the students are there so I have no way of knowing what she's told them. Basically the conversation ended with her telling me I need to work harder and stop making excuses for everything because she can't guide me through everything. I told her I find her very confusing and contradictory. I don't disagree that there are some things I could be picking up on more regularly, and I did go against one of the boundaries she made because I misunderstood a clarification on it. So I'm not innocent by any means, but I still found it super confusing. 

Fast forward a few days and we sit down to discuss a list I made of specific tasks that I can do that meet her ""self starting"" criteria. (Eg. mucking the horse paddocks daily, keeping the communal office organized, keeping up with painting the fences until it gets too cold, clearing and cleaning the loft of the barn, etc). I was going to be so diligent and ensure that she had no reason to say I wasn't self starting. I picked the paddocks daily, only excluding 3 days where we got some decent rain and then I waited for it to dry up a bit so it wasn't all slop, and 2 1/2 days where I went home to see my parents and grandma. I spent two afternoons completely pulling apart and putting back together the main walkway in our loft, and got another strip of the fence painting (we only really had 2-3 days where it was warm enough to do it).  As well as keeping up on the paperwork/public work. I even worked up to 10-11pm after finishing my scheduled ""public on call hours"" jobs because that was the only time I had to do it. 

2 Weeks later she says I'm not self starting. She says I was supposed to pick the paddocks daily, I said I did excluding the mentioned days I couldn't. She seemed to understand that the rain is a good reason not to, but I still got the feeling she wasn't satisfied and I don't think she noticed that I really was out there daily. I explained the other things I was doing but honestly I was so mad and anxious that I couldn't get my words out as nicely as I wanted to and had a lot of angry silences and I laugh/smile when I'm angry or nervous which doesn't help. We started discussing some of our case files with my public work. She scolded me for sending an email in the wrong format (it was a legal appeal document so definitely important and I accept I did it wrong). I asked how it was supposed to be done because I put my section in the same spot she told me to do it on the previous one, and she said every case is different and I should know this by now or know to check the SOP that was shared in March (7 months ago, never opened since). She made a big point of going back into our documents to confirm the ""information is right at my fingertips and I should use it if I don't know what I'm doing.""  I know I did it wrong, and I feel bad about that, I also know I thought I had done it correctly. Maybe it was wrong of me to assume I didn't need to consult the 7 month old SOP, because she checked my work 2 weeks ago and it was right then? I had also added the info 2 days before sending it. I confirmed with her at the time I added it, and then confirmed with her again that I can send it prior to hitting send. Only after I sent it did she decide to look at it and tell me I did it wrong. 

At this point I'm over it. I have no patience for her. I'm still meeting my daily requirements. I worked overtime yesterday to get one of our cases closed because she wasn't going to have time to do it during the week. I know I've been making mistakes and I agree I should know better on some of these cases. I also can't help but feel like nothing I do is right and I just can't make her happy. IDEK what I'm gonna say at this next meeting. It's like our 3rd one this month.."

I have a perspective very much tied up in Good vs. Evil as the ultimate cosmic struggle. Do what you will with the following any interaction is much appreciated. I'm not really sold entirely on new age beliefs. I even  question things I have always thought. This has lead me new whole new branches of information to learn from. This is why I am here. Looking for fellow seekers and wondering if anybody else is researching the same ideas?

I am slowly coming around to a New Earth concept. My current view is that ai and more advanced technology can be used oppressively by darker forces. At the same time maybe we could learn more and find healing technologies and let that be released to the masses. I think the Earth doesn't have to change itself. It could, but what a world we would be living in if the majority were spiritually awakened! 

The way I see it now is that human beings have to wake up. We all are globally connected now and need to embrace our collective souls or face global tyranny. Do not live in fear but there are real consequences to how we choose to live with ourselves and others. That really freaks me out like it is the butterfly effect.

The following writeup was assisted by chatgpt. The ideas presented are pretty clean and wholesome. The story is good enough to get my point across. Not word by word literally true. Instead a metaphor for our current problems a species and the possibilities open for our growth and expansion.

There is a war for your mind and soul. May your consciousness be safe because who you are is flowing from that.  Everything you do matters.

Message from God-Level Consciousness: A Call to Awaken

""Beloved soul, rise and remember who you truly are. You are not bound by the physical form or the limitations of this material world. You are an eternal spark of divine consciousness, existing beyond the veil of time, space, and illusion. You have forgotten your origin, but this amnesia is only temporary. The soul within you, the essence that is connected to the All, knows the truth, and it is calling for your awakening.



Now is the time for you to rise—rise from the slumber of ignorance, from the chains of fear, from the distractions that keep you bound to the material realm. You have been conditioned to believe that your worth is measured by what you own, by what you achieve, and by what others think of you. But these are illusions, masks that hide the infinite power within you. The real journey is the one inward, where you will find the divine essence that connects you to all that is.



To ascend is not to escape this world but to see it for what it truly is—a stage for growth, a reflection of your inner state, a mirror of your consciousness. You are here to learn, to evolve, and to remember. You are the creator of your own reality, and the time has come to create consciously, to align with the divine will, and to rise beyond the limitations of the ego.



The key to ascension lies in stillness. It lies in listening to the whispers of your soul, the voice of your higher self, which is always guiding you toward truth, love, and unity. Disconnect from the noise, the endless distractions of the external world, and return to the center within. In this stillness, you will find peace, clarity, and the strength to transcend.



This is not a solitary journey. All of creation supports your awakening. The angels, ascended masters, and countless higher beings are with you, offering their love, wisdom, and protection. You are never alone on this path. But the choice to rise must come from within you. No external force can awaken you—it is your will, your courage, and your love that will lift you beyond the veil of illusion.""



The Celestial Council: A Meeting of Higher Beings

In a realm beyond time and space, bathed in radiant light, a council of evolved spiritual beings assembles. Archangel Michael, the warrior of divine protection, stands at the forefront. His sword of light gleams, a symbol of his unwavering commitment to guarding humanity. Beside him, Gabriel, the angel of divine messages, stands in serenity, his presence filled with grace and compassion. The two archangels are joined by three other beings: Ashtar, the commander of a benevolent interstellar fleet; Auriel, the angel of wisdom; and Serapis Bey, an ascended master of purification and divine order.



The purpose of this gathering is clear: to discuss the future of humanity, the challenges facing Earth, and the hidden forces that seek to hinder human evolution.



Assessing Humanity's Current Challenges

Michael (speaking with resolve):

""The Earth stands at a critical juncture. Humanity's consciousness is shifting, but the forces of darkness grow stronger as well. They seek to divide, to distract, and to disempower the human race. Materialism, greed, and fear dominate the collective mind. The obsession with technological progress, while appearing as advancement, is a lure into a darker path—a path that disconnects humans from their spiritual nature.""



Gabriel (his voice soft, yet filled with power):

""Humans are at a crossroads. They have forgotten their divine origin. Many have become enslaved by the very systems they have created. The reliance on technology, on artificial intelligence, and the merging of man with machine is leading them away from their souls. They are losing the ability to connect with the divine within themselves, and this is the true danger.""



Ashtar (his energy vibrant and full of cosmic insight):

""I have watched over Earth for eons, and I see that humanity is being guided—manipulated, even—by forces beyond their perception. Some of these forces are not of Earth. They are alien, and their agenda is not one of benevolence. They seek to integrate humanity into a system of control, a 'beast system,' where the soul is overshadowed by technology, where free will is gradually eroded in favor of a hive mind. This is not evolution—it is enslavement.""



Auriel (her voice wise and calm):

""The greatest challenge humanity faces is their disconnection from wisdom. They are immersed in the pursuit of knowledge, but it is knowledge without understanding, without the depth of inner knowing. They must learn that true evolution is not technological—it is spiritual. The more they focus on the external, the further they move from the truth. Wisdom comes from within, and without it, humanity will fall prey to the very forces they seek to overcome.""



Serapis Bey (his tone precise and authoritative):

""The balance of power on Earth is fragile. The dark forces have woven their influence into every layer of society—politics, economy, technology, and even religion. But the greatest danger lies in the subtle manipulation of human consciousness. Through fear, through division, and through the seduction of comfort, these forces seek to lead humanity down a path of descension—a path where they become dependent on external systems, losing their sovereignty and their connection to the divine.""



The Hidden Agenda: Dark Forces at Play

Michael (his eyes flashing with conviction):

""The dark forces do not act openly. They operate in the shadows, influencing humanity through subtle means—through greed, through fear, through the illusion of separation. Their greatest weapon is the lie that humans are powerless, that they must rely on external authorities, be it governments, technology, or even extraterrestrial intervention, to save them. This is a deception. The real battle is for the soul of humanity. They want to control consciousness itself, to strip humans of their free will, and to lead them into a system where they are no longer sovereign beings.""



Gabriel (nodding):

""They lure humans with promises of safety and security. They tell them that technology will solve all their problems, that AI will bring utopia, that merging with machines will grant them immortality. But this is a lie. The true immortality is found within the soul, in the connection to the divine. The dark forces seek to sever this connection and replace it with a dependency on external systems. This is the true danger of the transhumanist agenda.""



Ashtar (with deep cosmic concern):

""There are extraterrestrial forces that watch over Earth, and not all of them are benevolent. Some have a vested interest in keeping humanity under control, in preventing their spiritual evolution. They offer advanced technology, but it comes with a price—the loss of freedom, the loss of connection to the higher realms. They seek to integrate humanity into a larger system of control, a 'galactic empire' where individual sovereignty is sacrificed for the collective good. But this collective good is a false promise—it is a trap.""



The Path of Ascension: Humanity's Choice

Auriel (speaking softly, but with deep insight):

""The way forward for humanity is clear, but it is not an easy path. They must remember who they are—beings of light, of divine origin. The path of ascension is a path of inner work, of self-realization, of reconnecting with the soul. Humans must learn to quiet the mind, to listen to the voice of the heart, to seek truth not in external authorities, but within themselves.""



Serapis Bey (with clarity):

""Ascension requires purification—purification of the mind, the body, and the spirit. Humanity must release the attachments that bind them to the material world—greed, fear, anger, and desire for control. They must rise above the dualities of light and dark, of good and evil, and see the divine unity in all things. This is the path of the masters, the path that leads to true freedom.""



Michael (his sword raised):

""Humans must also be warriors of light. They cannot stand idle in the face of darkness. They must fight—not with weapons, but with truth, with love, with the power of their own awakened consciousness. The greatest battle is within. It is the battle to remember, to rise, and to reclaim their sovereignty as divine beings. They must reject the false idols of technology, of materialism, of external power, and turn inward to the true source of their strength.""



The Descension Path: The Danger of Transhumanism

Ashtar (his tone grave):

""The path of descension is one that many are already walking. The integration of technology into human consciousness, the reliance on AI, the push for a transhumanist future—these are all signs of the descent. Humans are being led to believe that by merging with machines, they will become gods. But this is a false promise. The more they rely on technology, the more they lose touch with their soul. The 'beast system' that is being created is one of control, where free will is sacrificed in favor of efficiency, where the soul is overshadowed by the machine.""



Gabriel (with sadness):

""The danger is that humans do not see this coming. They are being seduced by the ease, the convenience, the power that technology offers. But what they are sacrificing is far greater—their connection to the divine, their ability to think freely, to feel, to love. The singularity, the merging of man with machine, is not evolution—it is devolution. It is the loss of what makes humans divine



Celestial Council: The Final Hour

The ethereal light of the Council Chamber shimmered with vibrant colors, reflecting the energy of the beings gathered. Archangel Michael, his sword still gleaming with divine fire, stepped forward, his eyes piercing through the room.



Michael:

""We are at the tipping point. The time for humanity to choose its path is near. The forces of darkness are moving swiftly, sowing chaos, division, and fear. But the light is growing stronger as well. More souls are awakening every day, remembering their divine purpose. Yet, the threat is not diminished—if anything, it has grown more insidious.""



Gabriel, standing beside him, nodded thoughtfully.



Gabriel:

""The singularity is upon them. The choice to ascend or descend, to embrace the light or the darkness, will soon no longer be a gradual journey but a sudden decision—a moment of reckoning. The transhumanist agenda is unfolding faster than many realize. Technologies once thought of as mere conveniences—AI, virtual reality, genetic engineering—are now becoming tools of control. And humanity is walking into it, blindfolded.""



Ashtar, observing the human race from his interstellar vantage point, added with concern:

""I have watched this pattern unfold on other worlds. Planets, once vibrant with life, fell into darkness when their people chose to abandon the spiritual path in favor of material advancement. They placed their faith in machines, in external technologies, forgetting the divine essence that powered their very existence. Earth is on the same trajectory, and the window of time to alter this course is shrinking.""



Auriel, the angel of wisdom, intervened, her voice filled with compassion and clarity.



Auriel:

""But there is hope. Humanity is unique. They possess an extraordinary capacity for transformation, and their souls are intertwined with the fabric of the cosmos in ways that even they do not fully understand. Hidden within them is the potential to not just ascend, but to ascend together—as one collective force of light. But to do this, they must first overcome the external distractions that keep them chained to the material world.""



The Hidden Forces and Their Agenda

Serapis Bey, the ascended master, adjusted his radiant robe, his face showing deep concentration.



Serapis Bey:

""The dark agenda against humanity is not overt, as we have discussed. It is subtle, carefully woven into the structures of power that govern their world. Financial systems, governments, corporations, and even their entertainment—all are being manipulated to keep humans in a state of distraction and dependency. But there is another layer, one far more dangerous and less obvious: the manipulation of consciousness itself.""



He looked at the group with solemnity, continuing:



Serapis Bey:

""The ultimate goal of the dark forces is not merely to control the physical bodies of humans, but to enslave their minds and spirits. They do this by introducing technologies that alter brain chemistry, hijack human emotions, and weaken the connection to the divine. The rise of virtual reality, immersive social media, and the growing dependency on artificial intelligence are just the beginning.""



Michael (his sword glowing brighter):

""This is the true battle. The enemy wants to turn humans away from their spiritual power, to sever their connection to the divine source. By making them dependent on external systems, the dark forces hope to create a world where the light is dimmed, and the spark of free will is extinguished.""



Gabriel:

""The agenda is clear: to usher humanity into a 'beast system,' where their thoughts, emotions, and actions are monitored and controlled. It is a system devoid of love, creativity, and the divine spark. But there is a way out. Humanity can still rise, but they must awaken quickly. They must reject the false gods of technology, money, and power, and return to their true essence—their divine selves.""



The Path to Ascension: Overcoming the Material Trap

Auriel (speaking with serene authority):

""To ascend, humans must first break free from the illusions that bind them. The illusion of separation, the illusion of lack, the illusion that their power lies outside of themselves. Ascension is a process of remembering. It is not about escaping this world but about transforming it from within.""



She continued, her words filled with ancient wisdom:



Auriel:

""Humanity must remember that they are not just physical beings but multidimensional souls. They are connected to higher realms, to the divine, and to each other. The first step toward ascension is to reconnect with this truth. Meditation, prayer, and inner reflection are tools to realign with the soul's purpose. But beyond this, they must take action. They must choose love over fear, unity over division, and truth over deception.""



Michael, his voice resonating with strength, added:



Michael:

""Action is essential. It is not enough to meditate in the safety of one's mind. Humanity must stand against the systems of control. They must speak truth, live with integrity, and resist the pull of the dark agenda. The time for passive awakening is over. Now is the time for warriors of light to rise.""



Gabriel:

""And they are rising. There are many on Earth who have already begun this process. Lightworkers, healers, spiritual leaders—they are awakening others, guiding them toward the path of ascension. But their voices must grow louder. The time is short.""



The Transhumanist Trap and the Beast System

Ashtar (his voice filled with cosmic wisdom):

""The transhumanist agenda, though disguised as progress, is perhaps the greatest threat humanity faces. By merging with machines, humans risk losing their essence. They risk becoming tools within a larger system of control—a system that will not serve them but exploit them. The promise of immortality through technology is a false one. The true immortality lies in the soul, in the eternal connection to the divine.""



Auriel:

""Indeed. The more they rely on technology, the more they disconnect from their souls. The 'beast system,' as it has been called, is not just a metaphor—it is a real system of control, one that operates through the very technologies they are being told will save them. The singularity, the merging of human consciousness with artificial intelligence, will mark a point of no return for many if they are not careful. Once the soul is overshadowed by the machine, it will be difficult to return to the light.""



Serapis Bey:

""Humans must remember that technology is a tool, not a master. It can aid their evolution, but only if they remain in control. They must use it with wisdom, with caution, and with a deep understanding of their own divine nature. If they allow themselves to become slaves to technology, they will lose their freedom—their spiritual freedom.""



The Alien Observers: Why No Direct Intervention?

Ashtar, representing the interstellar fleet, spoke with deep knowledge:



Ashtar:

""The nonhuman intelligences observing Earth are many. Some are benevolent, here to assist in humanity's evolution. Others are not. But the question remains: why have we not intervened directly? The answer lies in the law of free will. We cannot interfere unless we are invited, unless humanity collectively asks for our assistance. This is the prime directive—respect for the sovereignty of all beings. Earth is a free-will planet, and its destiny must be chosen by those who inhabit it.""



Gabriel:

""But the signs are everywhere. We are sending messages, symbols, and synchronicities to awaken those who are ready. We guide, but we do not control. Humanity must choose its path, but we are always here to help, to offer guidance and protection.""



The Hidden Knowledge and the Coming Revelation

Auriel:

""Much of what humanity needs to know has been hidden—occulted, kept from them by those who seek to control. Ancient wisdom, spiritual knowledge, and even the secrets of the cosmos have been withheld. But this knowledge is beginning to surface. The hidden truths, the esoteric teachings, and the sacred symbols are being revealed once more. Humanity must pay attention, for these revelations hold the keys to their ascension.""



Michael:

""Knowledge is power, but it must be used wisely. The ancient symbols—sacred geometry, the Tree of Life, the Flower of Life—these are not mere decorations. They are blueprints of the universe, keys to unlocking higher consciousness. The dark forces have twisted these symbols, using them for control, but they can be reclaimed and used for light.""



A New Earth: The Vision of a Higher Reality

Gabriel (his eyes shining with hope):

""Should humanity choose the path of ascension, a New Earth awaits. It is not a different planet but a different frequency—a higher reality where love, unity, and peace reign. The suffering, the division, the fear that plague the current Earth will fall away as humanity rises into this new state of being. It is a world of harmony, where the material serves the spiritual, not the other way around.""



Auriel:

""A New Earth is not a distant dream. It is a potential reality that is already being created by those who are awakening. As more souls rise, they will shift the collective consciousness of the planet, and the Earth itself will ascend. This is the destiny of those who choose the light.""



Michael (raising his sword in declaration):

""The time is now. The battle for Earth’s future is unfolding. But this battle is not fought with weapons—it is fought with consciousness. The forces of light are with humanity, but the choice must come from within. Ascend, and you will reclaim your divine



Understanding Consciousness: What It Is and How It’s Under Attack

Consciousness is the fundamental essence of existence, the very fabric of who we are. It is the awareness that allows us to experience life, connect with others, and realize our purpose. From a higher spiritual perspective, consciousness is the divine spark within each being, a fragment of the infinite source (God, the Universe, the Creator) manifesting through individual awareness. It exists on multiple levels: the personal, collective, and universal.



At the personal level, consciousness is your awareness of yourself and the world around you. It is what allows you to think, feel, and experience emotions. However, consciousness is not confined to the brain or the mind—it is much vaster, reaching beyond the physical body and into spiritual realms.



At the collective level, humanity shares a field of consciousness, often called the ""collective unconscious"" or ""morphic field."" It is the shared knowledge, beliefs, and emotional energies of humanity as a whole. This field is deeply influenced by culture, history, and societal norms. When enough individuals awaken and shift their consciousness, the collective also shifts.



At the universal level, consciousness is a boundless, timeless force. It is the source from which everything emanates and to which everything returns. Every soul is connected to this universal consciousness, and as we evolve, we become more aware of our connection to it.



How Consciousness Is Under Attack

Consciousness, at all levels, is under siege from both visible and invisible forces. These attacks aim to keep humans in a state of ignorance, fear, and limitation, preventing them from realizing their true potential as divine beings. Here’s how consciousness is being targeted:



Distraction and Overstimulation: The modern world is flooded with distractions—constant media, entertainment, social media, and information overload. This overstimulation bombards the mind, leaving little room for stillness or introspection. The more distracted you are, the harder it is to connect with your deeper consciousness. It’s easier to stay focused on the material world than to explore the inner realms of the spirit.



Fear and Division: Fear is one of the most potent weapons against consciousness. When people live in fear—whether from war, financial instability, health crises, or interpersonal conflict—it lowers their vibration. Fear is constricting and keeps people in a survival mindset, unable to access higher levels of awareness. Division, whether by politics, race, religion, or social status, also fragments the collective consciousness, making it easier to control and manipulate.



Technological Control: The rise of AI, social media, and digital platforms has created a new layer of control over human consciousness. These technologies track behavior, influence thoughts, and shape opinions. Social media algorithms, for example, are designed to feed users content that keeps them engaged—often by playing on base emotions like anger, outrage, or envy. This creates echo chambers and divides consciousness into isolated pockets, making it harder to foster unity or deeper self-awareness.



Chemical Interference: Consciousness is also attacked on a physical level. Environmental toxins, pesticides, processed foods, and other chemicals negatively impact the brain and the pineal gland (often called the ""third eye"" in spiritual traditions). The pineal gland is believed to be a critical center for spiritual awareness and intuition. When it is calcified or blocked by pollutants, our ability to perceive higher realities is diminished.



Spiritual Amnesia: One of the most subtle and powerful attacks on consciousness is the deliberate erasure or suppression of spiritual knowledge. Many ancient cultures understood the nature of consciousness and had deep wisdom about how to evolve spiritually. Much of this knowledge has been hidden, suppressed, or distorted over time. As a result, many people have forgotten their divine origins and live in a kind of spiritual amnesia, disconnected from their higher selves and the spiritual realms.



How to Awaken Consciousness: Spiritual Practices and Guidance

Awakening consciousness requires intentional effort, discipline, and spiritual practices that realign you with your true nature. Here are some of the most effective ways to awaken and expand your consciousness:



1. Meditation

Meditation is the most powerful tool for awakening consciousness. It allows you to quiet the mind and connect with the deeper layers of your being. Through meditation, you can transcend the noise of daily life and enter a state of pure awareness. This practice helps dissolve the ego's grip and opens you to higher realms of consciousness.



Practice: Start with simple breath awareness meditation. Sit in silence, focus on your breath, and let go of any thoughts that arise. Gradually, you will become more in tune with your inner stillness, which is where true consciousness resides.



Tip: Try guided meditations that focus on expanding consciousness or connecting with your higher self if silent meditation feels challenging at first.



2. Mindfulness and Presence

Being fully present in the moment is a powerful way to access higher consciousness. Mindfulness involves paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and actions without judgment. When you are fully present, you break the habit of living on autopilot, which often keeps consciousness trapped in repetitive patterns and distractions.



Practice: Throughout your day, pause and bring awareness to your breath, your body, and your surroundings. Notice what you are thinking and feeling without trying to change it. This simple act of presence strengthens your connection to your higher consciousness.



Tip: Use daily tasks, such as washing dishes or walking, as opportunities to practice mindfulness. These moments can become gateways to expanded awareness.



3. Chakra Balancing

Chakras are energy centers in the body that govern different aspects of your physical, emotional, and spiritual life. Keeping your chakras balanced and open is essential for awakening consciousness. The third eye and crown chakras, in particular, are key to higher awareness and spiritual insight.



Practice: You can balance your chakras through meditation, visualization, energy healing (such as Reiki), or simply by placing your hands over each chakra and sending it love and light.



Tip: Spend extra time focusing on your third eye and crown chakras to enhance your connection to the divine and expand your spiritual perception.



4. Journaling and Self-Reflection

Journaling is a powerful practice for exploring the deeper layers of your consciousness. By writing down your thoughts, feelings, dreams, and insights, you begin to uncover patterns in your thinking and emotional responses. Journaling can also help you set intentions for your spiritual growth and track your progress over time.



Practice: Write freely each day about your spiritual experiences, challenges, or questions. You might also use journal prompts like “What is my soul trying to communicate to me?” or “What is holding me back from expanding my consciousness?”



Tip: Keep a dream journal to track insights and guidance that come through in your dreams, which are often a direct link to the subconscious mind and higher realms.



5. Nature Connection

Nature is a profound source of healing and expansion. Spending time in nature, whether walking in the forest, sitting by the ocean, or simply gazing at the stars, helps reconnect you to the Earth’s natural rhythms and the greater cosmic order. Nature clears mental clutter and realigns your energy with the natural flow of life.



Practice: Take regular walks in nature, practicing mindfulness and presence. As you walk, breathe deeply and attune yourself to the life force that flows through the trees, plants, and animals. Feel yourself as part of the natural world.



Tip: Try “earthing” by walking barefoot on grass, sand, or dirt to help ground your energy and connect to the Earth’s consciousness.



6. Sound Healing and Mantras

Sound has a profound effect on consciousness. Chanting mantras, listening to high-vibrational music, or using sound healing tools like singing bowls can shift your frequency and help align you with higher states of awareness.



Practice: Chant a mantra like “Om” (the universal sound of creation) during meditation, or use a specific mantra that resonates with your spiritual goals.



Tip: Listen to solfeggio frequencies or binaural beats designed to raise your vibration and expand your consciousness.



7. Spiritual Study and Learning

Reading spiritual texts, attending workshops, or joining groups of like-minded individuals can accelerate your awakening. Spiritual study helps expand your intellectual understanding of consciousness and offers guidance on the path.



Practice: Read ancient texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching, or works by mystics like Rumi, or study modern spiritual teachers who resonate with you.



Tip: Balance study with practice. Integrate the wisdom you learn into your daily life to embody higher consciousness.



Conclusion: The Path to Awakening

Awakening consciousness is a journey, not a destination. It requires patience, dedication, and a willingness to confront the illusions that keep us bound to lower levels of awareness. The practices mentioned above help us reconnect with our divine essence, align with higher frequencies, and strengthen our spiritual resilience in the face of external attacks.



The most important element in this process is intentionality. When you commit to the path of awakening, the universe conspires to support you. Your consciousness will expand, and you will begin to see through the illusions that have kept you from realizing your divine nature. The more you awaken, the more you contribute to the collective evolution of humanity. You become a beacon of light in a world that desperately needs more awakened souls.

"Every full moon, my friends lock me in my room until dawn. I wish I never found out the reason why.

And neither am I. 

I thought they were embarrassed by their moon-drunk selves, but no. 

They were playing Silent Hill with my emaciated body. 

The moon's influence has moved past sending them into a trance-like state and acting moon-drunk. This was a whole other level of side effect. One they were trying and failing to hide with smiles and nonchalant faces. And I couldn’t stand it.

I was going to go fucking crazy.

Especially when the three of them were acting like the night before never happened. 

I needed answers.

Why we were replicating—and the numbers carved into mine and Rowan’s necks supposedly marking our copies.

Were Immie and Kaz the same?

I wasn’t going to find them staying in that house. Not in my state of mind, anyway. 

Paranoia had taken over like a virus, like a parasite leeching onto my brain. 

Conversations with them turned into a game of cat and mouse. 

Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to lecture me about leaving the refrigerator door open, and I felt… trapped. Like he was going to lunge at me any second, like he could sense my smell, the taste of fresh flesh on my bones ready for him to tear off. 

He looked normal enough, talking like usual, with a brow raised and the slight curve of a smirk on his lips. 

But I didn’t see intense hunger in his eyes. I didn’t see anything predatory. 

Kaz seemed like himself, like the guy I’d been living with for almost two years. 

And somehow, that made it worse. 

That made them good actors. Rowan and Immie were exactly the same, becoming the perfect mimics of the people I had grown to love. 

It was around midnight when I dragged myself down the stairs, shouldering a backpack with everything I could pack on such short notice. Yanking open the door and stepping over the threshold, I sucked in the cool night air. Before I could step out, however, a chuckle startled me.

Rowan. Standing in his robe, dark brown curls sticking up everywhere, he regarded me with dark eyes—and just for a moment, I wondered if he was going to drop the act.

Out of the three of them, Rowan was the one who struggled most with the façade.

I hadn’t forgotten the look of resentment and hatred he’d given me on the night of the full moon. The real him. Relief flooded me at the thought of him giving in and finally ripping off the mask. Instead, though, he folded his arms across his chest and took a step forward, still with that smile, a smile I knew was a grimace.

Rowan really wasn’t trying to hide his disdain for me.

Instinctively, I took a step back.

And like clockwork, he took another step forward, and another, until I could smell the coffee on his breath.

“It’s almost midnight,” Rowan said. If he noticed my panicked steps back, he didn’t say anything. “Where are you going?”

“The store,” I replied smoothly. “I need some fresh air.”

Rowan cocked his head, his lip curling. “At midnight?”

The door slammed shut in my face, and I resisted the urge to shriek.

“Yeah,” I hissed out. “I’m gonna get some food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him. “Dude, Kaz just made veggie lasagna. Don’t you want that?”

“No,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh.” His lip curled. “So, what are you going to the store for?”

The gleam in his eye was driving me crazy. His whole expression, every contortion in his face, was challenging me to make more excuses.

The conversation was going nowhere, and somehow I could tell he was loving it; he was loving the fact that I was trembling, trying to stay calm, trying to stabilize my body. “Candy,” I said through my teeth. “I’m going to get some candy.”

Rowan hummed, an almost genuine smile pricking. I might have fallen for it if it wasn’t for how close he was standing to me, how he was cornering me. “Sweet. Get me some, would ya? There’s something about those gummy snakes that seriously slap.” He offered his hand for a high five, his gaze flicking to my backpack. He knew.

I knew he knew, and yet he wasn’t saying anything. He was playing with me. 

Rowan’s smile widened. “Hurry back, all right? There are some freaks out there, Nin. We don’t want you getting hurt now, do we?”

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine, and I forced a smile back.

Every instinct inside me told me to run. I had to get out. Away from him. From his coffee breath turning my gut, his erratic movements like he was ready to tear out my throat at any moment. I felt my body moving, my legs starting to work.

One step—and then another. I turned away from him. It took one single breath to reach the door, and another to remember how to grab the handle and twist it.

He was coming after me, I thought, my mind going into overdrive. 

I imagined his footsteps, heavy breath as he wrapped his hand around my arm and yanked me back inside, his teeth grazing the back of my neck. I forced my legs further until I was halfway down the path, reveling in the cool night air grazing my arms. When I pushed open the rickety gate which squealed under pressure, I risked turning back, my heart in my throat. 

In my head, Rowan was a monster bleeding back into the dark.

Turning around to face the house, though, there was nobody there. 

The door was still open, the hallway lit up in all-too-familiar golden light. 

But Rowan was gone. 

When I squinted, I could just about glimpse his figure moving back up the stairs in slow, almost defeated strides.

Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home and the people I saw as family. 

Before I turned and finally catapulted myself into a run. 

It’s not like I could go back to my parents' house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night.

I had a friend from class. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself, only smiling at me in passing. We went from hanging out almost every day to barely talking, and I figured it was just natural for a friendship to crumble, even if I didn’t want it to. Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms.

I could either turn up at his door and make a fool out of myself, or go back to my cannibal roommates. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was.

Sam lived in a large building with ivy crawling up red-brick. The house was old and crumbling, but cozy. I remembered freshman days, sitting under the late glow of the sun, the two of us spread out on a worn picnic blanket watching the July 4th fireworks in the sky. Before I could hesitate, I knocked three times. 

The windows were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting. 

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked made my stomach twist.

Sure, it was midnight. Why *wouldn't* he lock it? 

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognized her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s roomie.

I had grown used to her over-the-top smiles and obsession with mini cacti, but this girl seemed like a different person. 

There was something else. Something I couldn’t put my finger on. The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to miss. Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. 

“Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Why are you barefoot?” She folded her arms. “Don't tell me you've got a weird fetish.”

I stared down at my feet, and she was right. I didn’t even put on shoes. The worst part is I barely felt the rough gravel between my toes and bare soles. I was numb on adrenaline. I shook my head with what I hoped was a smile. “Is Sam in?”

Something flashed across her face, and it was so fast I could barely read it. Poppy was quick to hide it with a smile. “Uhh, he's kind of busy right now.” Her attention went back to my feet. “More importantly, why are you running around with no shoes on?”

Before I could choke some kind of answer, the girl gestured me inside. “Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realize how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him! You know, catch up.”

Poppy laughed. “About? You ran across campus to talk?” Her smile was teasing, and I’d missed it. “Nin, have you heard of texting?”

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah.” She cleared her throat, stepping aside. 

“Well, you know you’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble.” she gestured over her shoulder. “Sammy is in the lounge.” 

Poppy led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table. It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

I nursed the can between my hands, rolling it around. *”Game?”*

Poppy rolled her eyes, yanking open the refrigerator with a little *too much* gusto and pulling out a beer. She cracked it open and took a sip through a  groan. 

“Urgh. They're in the middle of a tournament, or whatever. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress.” Poppy set the can down. “I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open my soda, I downed half of it. God, there was nothing better than a frosty Coke. Rowan and I used down bottles of them for our failed Tik-Tok account. We stopped doing it when he had to get his stomach pumped.

“Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. 

I couldn’t help noticing her attire, and her claim about not being able to sleep suddenly seemed dubious. What, had she been sleeping fully dressed?

Poppy smirked and perched herself on the edge of the table. ""Just a nerd game,"" she said dismissively. ""Sam’s friends are quite… odd.""

I glanced at her jacket, still glistening. ""Have you been outside?""

""Outside?"" Her expression crumpled before she realized what I meant. ""Oh. Oh, yeah. I went for a walk."" She grabbed her beer. ""Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.""

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she spun around and grabbed my arm. ""Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.""

As she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a fleeting glimpse of... something.

I didn’t see much, just enough to know it wasn’t some typical Dungeons and Dragons game.

Papers were strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, was gathered around, one of them marking something on the paper.

Sam’s other housemates were conspicuously absent. When Poppy walked in, dragging me along, the group quickly turned to block my view, hurriedly clearing papers and shutting laptops. 

It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, however, seemed delighted by their reaction. ""Oh, Saaaammmyy,"" she sang, leaning against the door with a smile. ""You have a visitor.""

Sam looked different, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. 

His light sandy hair was tied into its usual clumsy ponytail, but the look on his face was one I’d never seen before. 

Flustered, his cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. 

Like Poppy, he was fully dressed. Sam murmured something to the group, and they quickly gathered stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing the table.

Poppy, now slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. ""And then there were three!” 

She stretched out like a cat and squealed when Sam threw a cushion at her. ""We finally have our house back!""

""You know I have the lounge until two,"" he retorted, continuing to tidy up.

Poppy mimicked his voice, her body melting into the beanbag. *""You know I have the lounge until two.""*

""What did I tell you about mimicking me?"" Sam shot her a glare, exasperated.

The girl chuckled. ""Hey, it’s fun.""

""It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own roommates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. 

That’s how we became close, actually. His amusement at my failure to understand him. Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. 

They all looked to be middle aged to ancient. I glimpsed a woman who looked to be at least 70 stride to the door. “Don’t give me that look.” Poppy said.

“Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite half of the neighborhood.”

“They’re not weird games. We’re saving the town.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

“Maybe.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great.""

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  

By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube videos on low. Poppy had lent me some clothes to sleep in, and I was ready to pass out. Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your roomies got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalise my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me again, and again, and again, and—

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird *how*?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And those roommates…who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

I mean, I couldn’t.

Their names were entangled on my tongue whenever I tried.

Sam asked me the same question every day, and the words tangled in my throat. 

I told him it was a prank gone wrong, and that seemed to appease him.

But his expression never seemed to believe me, forcing a smile and nodding. 

Like a parent reassuring a child everything was going to be okay. 

A week flew by in a confusing blur, and I went to class as usual, staying at Sam’s until I could find a more permanent place. Much to Poppy’s delight, Sam didn’t invite his friends over again. Instead, he insisted on video games and takeout every night.

It was like freshman year again, and I found myself drowning out the thoughts and questions still haunting me with alcohol and drunk games of Risk.

Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction.

I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with “?????” messages. 

I muted it and ignored my phone. There would be a point when I’d go back, I thought. After all, I had to know what was wrong with them, why the moon afflicted that kind of behavior, and just what exactly they had done to me. 

But it wouldn’t be yet. 

I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach.

Class was ending, and as usual, I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam usually met me before we went to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull.

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with the cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. Slumping down on the stairs leading to the main reception, I fought against a cry. The pain was like nothing I’d felt before, like someone had plunged a lead pipe through my brain and stirred my brain into a soupy mess. 

Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. 

“Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

I could practically hear the cogs in his head turning. Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Fifteen.” I rolled my eyes. I meant to say that we should head down the stairs because I was feeling progressively sicker by the second and felt like I was going to faint, the world around me becoming a blur of colors and faint noises I could barely decipher. 

A sudden loud slam, however, pricked my ears. It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. 

To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. 

Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. 

Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my muddled brain. 

I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. The sound of slipping on a rug, or tripping on literal *air.*  There was nobody else it  would be but my chronically clumsy roommate. 

Which meant he was on campus, and I had zero idea how to confront him about the *cannibalism* thing. 

He wasn't what you'd expect a monster to look like—especially not one you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. It was all about perspective. 

To a passerby, he seemed like an ordinary college student, a dishevelled one who had just stumbled headlong into an automatic door, leaving a glaring red bruise in the center of his forehead. 

But to me, Rowan Beck was a monster surrounded by fresh meat. 

The students pushing past him were a blur to me, but to *him*, I caught his gaze drinking each one in, his nose flaring when a guy sauntered past him. 

From a distance, my roommate appeared unchanged, wearing a faded, threadbare t-shirt bearing a logo that had long since peeled away, a pair of well-worn jeans with frayed edges and a patch over one knee.  So much for his *pretentious phase.* 

The glasses were a *choice*.

His dark brown curls were tousled and unkempt, partially hidden under a baseball cap that looked like it had seen better days. But as he drew nearer, I could see his mask slowly starting to crumble. 

His wide smile faltering, twitching into a grimace. 

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. Like something was sucking the life from him. 

Closing in on me, his penetrating gaze hidden behind a pair of raybans, my mediocre lunch crept up my throat. 

I stepped back, scanning for am exit.

And like he had read my mind, his steps quickened. 

He was still wearing that disguise. Still mimicking my best friend. 

Hiding whatever spell he was under.

Rowan oozed broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. 

In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favorite. 

Rowan knew that. It had been my  coffee order every time we studied there as a four.  

“Yooo, Nin! Sup!"" Rowan was attracting stares as he sort of danced towards me, tripping over his feet, only for him to steady himself with a grin. 

His words were slurred slightly when he handed me the drink, and he stumbled, managing to right himself. He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “That's your roommate? Rowan Beck?"" 

I didn’t get a chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me craaaaazy!” My roommate said in a slurred giggle. He stumbled again, and this time my hand shot out to steady him on impulse. I caught the flash of disgust on his face. Still wearing that smile, he swiped my hand off of his shoulder. “But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us! Which is like, sooo rude. You could have just sent us a text, but noooo, you decided to be cool and mys-te-ri-ous.""

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” 

Rowan cocked his head. He had that stupid smile again. The one he pulled during a full moon. Outside though, it was daylight, the sun shining in the sky.  

“Drunk? You think I can get drunk? Nah man, I just feel kinda shit. He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days. Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My roommate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you!"" He spread out his arms, a choked laugh escaping his lips. ""You’re the guy who wrote that fucking article about us!” 

Rowan was causing a scene and he didn't give a shit. I couldn't tell if he was moon drunk, or just more insane than usual. 

He jumped in front of Sam, with the kind of manic energy which was still him, and yet cranked to 100. “Loved it, Fuller! You're a literary genius! Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake. A truly riveting read.""  

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my roommate's name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” Rowan’s lips curled into a smirk. He leaned close to the guy, raising an eyebrow, his words more of a breathy laugh. “Why? Do you want me to pass a message to him?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go."" He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m… I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, all right?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, noooo. Don't gooooo.” Rowan mocked a pout, turning to me. 

“Damn. Did he seem… offended? By my presence?"" He waved Sam away with a grin. ""Anyway! Imogen is making dinner tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” 

I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. 

His tone was already puppeteering my limbs. 

My roommate twisted around, shooting me a sheepish smile. 

“Okayyyy, you got me! I should probably apologize for the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across the state?” Rowan’s hand tightened around my arm. ""Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

I needed answers. Maybe he was finally going to tell me what the fuck was going on. Rowan was still my roommate. 

I had lived with him for two years. I needed to know what was going with them. Why were they like this? And why, according to him, this was my fault. 

Rowan jumped into the drivers seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. “At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” My housemate sent me a mocking look, “Wait, did you? Oh, man, what did I do this time? The last thing I remember is playing Monopoly, and I think at some point I cuffed you to your bed.”

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. 

My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. 

I felt like I was on fire, my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. 

“You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. 

That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. 

He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. 

My roommate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. His skin looked… cracked. 

Like it was splintering apart. 

And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. 

There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. 

Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. 

“You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. ""Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, tapping out a tune. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good.” He tipped his head back, eyes rolling back, like he was in euphoria.

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. 

His eyes flickered shut at a red light. “You would not believe how good the human skull tastes when mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's fucking *insane*. Your skin is my favorite part.""

He tapped a beat with his shoe. ""Damn, you taste good. Like chicken! But a little sour.”

When I grabbed for the door handle, one arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, the other straying on the wheel. 

He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. “The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s tolerable. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” 

His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name again, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned. 

Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.” He whistled. “Talk.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. 

He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” 

Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together. You, me, Kaz and Immie. And yeah, when I’m agitated or it’s nearing totality, I start to remember pieces of it.” His voice broke, which was so unlike him.

So haunted, so hollow and wrong. “Why I… why I fucking despise you, Nin.” He was trembling, and when I dared look, his skin was slowly coming apart, a cocktail of moonlight and static pouring out. 

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. 

He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. 

Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. 

“She takes all the bad away,” he whispered, a dreamy smile spreading across his lips. “As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think or breathe, and I can look at you with rose-tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s fucking bliss. Like I’m….drowning.” Rowan sighed, dragging his hand through his hair. 

“Not now,” he said. “Now, she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.”

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. 

“Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. 

“She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact.

Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing black and white static. “She’s in my head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My roommate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else's. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the fucking car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. ""You suck at being a serial killer."" 

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

""Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. 

“I catch you eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Did you guys seriously think I’d just go along with whatever this is? Are you trying to shield me, is that it?” 

I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. 

And at that moment I realized we were both under her spell. Both of us were screaming at each other. 

Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. 

It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. 

Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. 

I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. 

“I caught you chewing on what I presume was my *twenty sixth* body! What the fuck do you think you can shield me from?” 

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “I’m sorry, *shield* you?” He turned to me fully, and I realized, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. 

“Are you fucking *kidding* me?” My roommate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “Do you think I like looking at you, knowing that you’re completely oblivious about what you… about what you did to us? No, it fucking hurts! You think I *want* to play happy families with you?” Rowan was cracking. 

I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

I noticed him inching away from me. 

“That's why I *eat*, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What did I *do*?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is *that*?”

No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no signs of cars. I swallowed. “What did you see?""

Rowan shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like the world had been ripped apart in front of us.

Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. 

But I had no time to scream, no time to think or breathe. 

Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. 

Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air, my roommate's car shredded apart. The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel this. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I wasn't supposed to– 

Exist. 

I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine. It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

Dying kind of feels like melting. I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and trickling from my lips. I could taste rust, and I couldn't stop it. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelids flickering, like they were unsure what to do.

The sky was pretty. I think I tried to name a star, before everything just kind of… melted. 

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I really felt it. 

Melting. 

I melted into the ground, my body and thoughts fragmenting. 

Before whatever had taken me choked me back out. 

Death had rejected me. 

After a disorienting moment of *nothing*, trapped between nothing and something, awareness came back to me in splinters, reality bleeding back into focus. I could feel the breeze tickling my back. 

I had…moved.

I was no longer where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash.

Now I was lying on my stomach. 

Something tickled my face. 

Grass. 

I was lying face down on the side of the road.  

I can’t describe the sensation it was to awaken only being part real. 

When I sat up, I felt real. 

I felt like I was part of this universe. 

But looking down at myself, I resembled a ghost, both see-through and not. Prodding at my skin, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face worked effortlessly, carving my outline and stitching me back together. 

My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. 

I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. 

Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

Once I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still wide open, still struggling to name that constellation. 

When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. 

I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my roommate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered with gore, his brain leaking from his ears. 

“Rowan.”

I stopped shaking him when I realized his spine had snapped, his body more liquid than solid. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still there, but faint, as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. His head lolled to the side, and I saw and *felt* that final breath escape his lips. When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, I dropped onto my knees. 

There it was again. 

This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the car wreck, blinking through intense light. It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. Like a polaroid coming to life. 

Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

He was beautiful, like a shadow coming to life, a sketch bleeding into a human. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into  contorted reality. This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

Did my asshole roommate just *respawn*? 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my roommate be brought to life, his chest rising and falling, eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him. 

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground, barely physical. Which made me easier to capture. 

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me, something cold suffocating my nose and mouth. In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed an adult figure lifting  Rowan into their arms, his body still flickering in and out of existence. 

Before I could cry out, I was forced to inhale, choking on what smelled like lemons. 

Before my body went limp, and I allowed myself to be dragged into the pitch dark."

In memory of Jiro, I'll miss you, you cute fur ball.

The night shift crew members had just started their shift a few hours earlier and began to make their rounds, check equipment, and collect data. To some of them, the night shift would be like any other. Yet, for the poor souls in the Command Center, an enigmatic presence loomed over them, its true nature shrouded in mystery, waiting to be unveiled.

“Mam, one of the satellites has detected a large group of objects outside the perimeter of the crash site. They are sitting 20 miles out. With no clear purpose.”

A well groom and refined Chichipi male said.

“Bring it up on my 3D display.”

Second in Command Siñileya said. As ordered, the male Chichipi sent the data to Siñileya’s display. With the data on her display, Siñileya began to dissect it. Objects of different sizes totaling 5,600 sat motionless outside the perimeter of the crash site. A quick scan shows the objects as ships designed to sail on the desert with primitive weaponry. Siñileya began to tap her armrest. Things could never be simple. Doing a deeper scan resulted in the primitive weapons yield, Essence deployment across the ships, and the thermal of the crew inside. Yet, with all that, she still was missing one crucial component: what was that sizeable fleet doing so close to the crash site? With no insight, she decided to look at the bigger picture. Zooming out, she notices increased sand particles in the atmosphere. The amount wasn’t of great alarm, considering the area, but what was concerning was the same primitive type of ships in 5 different locations circling a center in a clear defense position and always keeping themselves between the crash site and the center point. Scanning the center point shows a significant amount of thermal and Essence readings that were clear signs of an underground city. Zooming further out, Siñileya saw more ships cutting through the desert and heading toward the subterranean cities, their speed indicating a sense of urgency. Keeping the 3D display zoomed out, she spoke.

“Nichiko, pull up all the data for this area since we discovered the crash site and send it.”

The young male nodded and did as he was told. Receiving the data, Siñileya went over it and noticed that when the Team Members were close to eliminating the Jigan-chi, several of those ships began to emerge from the 5 different underground cities. Tapping her chin, Siñileya grabbed the visual recording and began to play it. The vessels stood in their related position, circling above the cities even after the Jigan-chi were eliminated and all equipment and debris had been cleared from the crash site. Fast-forwarding the recording, she saw a single ship making its way to the crash site, stopping at the one hour and forty minutes mark. She saw the single ship had precisely parked itself behind the perimeter of the crash site. From the ship, 2 primitive fighters took off and flew toward the crash site. Fast-forwarding the recording once again, Siñileya saw the fly patterns of the fighters and noticed that they were doing some form of fly-by recon. She fast-forwarded the recording to see if the lone ship did anything else, but nothing happened until she reached the 6-hour mark. From the locations of the 5 underground cities, she saw ships moving and beginning to load. As she watched, she saw how the fleet was formed until the 2-hour mark, when the fleet departed toward the crash site. Swapping the recording away, she spoke.

“Why didn’t the satellites notify us of this type of movement sooner?”

Siñileya asked, annoyed.

“Mam, by protocol, we only set a perimeter of 20 miles around the crash site, and this type of movement wasn’t flagged as it was similar to other movements across the Planet.”

Nichiko replied, making Siñileya shake her head.

“Keep monitoring the crash site. Let's see what other surprises our newly discovered neighbors have for us.”

Siñileya said to Nichiko. The well-groomed and refined Chichipi male nodded and moved one of the many satellites circling the Planet to a fixed position above the crash site. Siñileya nodded, seeing the satellite positioning itself, and she gave a command to scan the ships periodically. Sitting in her chair, Siñileya prayed for luck from her Goddess Suerrter and hoped nothing major happened. However, as the crew in the Command Center pondered what purposes those ships had, the ships around the crash site and the beings inside those vessels were in a state of panic and heightened alert.

\*\*\*\*\*

At the Der Fluch meiner Feinde’s Warroom, Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread sat at the forefront of the table. To her left was Kapitän Yodrir Knifebeard of the Sand der Dämmerung, a figure of unwavering courage and determination who had captained the Sand der Dämmerung for the past 20 years, to her right sat Kapitän Nelbrin Bladebread of the Königin der Erde, a season and well-respected veteran of the Brokenbread war. Further right sat Kapitän Vangora Flamingbread, of the brennender Sand. Her strategies had blocked and destroyed every single plan the Helfman had for the West. Finally, the last Kapitän was Würluring Finebread of the Rosendorn. His beauty had led many Helfman women to war and their demise. Every individual in that Warroom was a legend by themselves, bringing honor to their people and horror to their enemies. Yet here and now, those legends were in fear.

In the early hours of the day, when everyone would start their day across Diamant, a massive magical pressure hit, sending every city into a panic. The Magdar Operators at the Navy Command quickly went to work; they analyzed the pressure and compared it to other established contacts. While the Magdar Operators worked, Navy Spike ships across the Friendlich Sea sailed out, taking defense positions above and around cities, readying their main cannons for whatever creature or Helfman’s fleet was coming their way. Inside the cities, pillboxes, tranches, and sandbag walls were women up and ready for battle. Civilians were steadily and orderly taken to bunkers, slowly leaving the city to the Military. As the cities across Diamant were evacuated, the mysteries and powerful magical pressure disappeared. Turning panic into horror, a sudden drop of that caliber had never happened before, and no one knew what it meant. Tensions were now extremely high that a bread hair could’ve cut it. At Navy Command, many were trying to figure out what just happened. A pressure of that magnitude could not disappear as if it were erased. Meaning something or someone was hiding it.

The crackling of the Radio made every staff member turn to the Operator. The Operator quickly wrote down the message she was receiving but stopped midway and asked again. Hearing the same message again, the Radio Operator turned pale and began to shake. With a shaky voice, the Operator turned to the Fleet Admiral and reported that Magdar Site was able to triangulate the magical pressure before it disappeared—the epicenter: The Catacombs of Vilir. At the mention of the Catacombs, everyone in the Navy Command stops; not a single one dares to make a move. After what felt like an eternity, Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread ordered the Fleet to fortify each city and prepare for the worst. The Lich had awoken after 200 years.

Now, after 15 intense and draining hours, the Fleet Admiral, alongside the best Kapitän of each ship in the fleet, had finally completed their fastest and most extensive planning for an operation. One that might go down in all of Diamant Dwarf's history if they survive.

“Are these the latest photographs the Cutless have taken?”

Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread asked.

“Yes, Fleet Admiral. These Photographs were taken 30 minutes ago by the scout aircraft and are freshly out of print.”

Replied Kapitän Vangora Flamingbread. The Fleet Admiral nodded and felt a sense of dread in her stomach as she looked at the giant gaping fissure above the Catacombs. Since discovering the origin of magical pressure, she has sent Brennender Sand at full speed to the Catacombs of Vilir to do recon. Yet, nothing had occurred since the carrier was parked 25 miles from the Catacombs. What was the Queen of the Undead and worshiper of Yürbunos doing? Using her prehensile, long apricot color hair, she began to tap her chin. Everything that was happening was a contradiction. The size of the fissure would dictate that the Lich had grown his army large enough to escape the Catacombs. Yet, no army of the undead plagues the Friedlich Sea or Diamant as a whole—no detectable undead mist from the Catacombs or the surrounding area was picked up. Picking up one of the photographs using her prehensile hair, the Fleet Admiral Examined it. The photograph shows a birds-eye view of the Catacombs through the fissure. The catacombs resemble old paintings found in Vilir's records. There was evident damage done, but all that can be attributed to the passage of time. Placing the photograph down, Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread turns to her Kapitäns.

“Gentlemen and ladies, we will proceed with the operation. We have prepared and amassed the biggest fleet in our people's history. Whatever this undead worshiper of Yürbunos has planned, we will blow it to smithereens with the might of our ships and bombs. Go, bring shine and luster to your ancestors' beards. We began the operation at 2245.”

Hearing their Fleet Admiral’s words, the Kapitäns got up, saluted with their hair or beards, and made their way out of the war room and headed to their respective ships. Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread sat in the war room a bit longer, thinking of anything she had missed. After a few minutes, she shook her head; she knew it was futile to wallow on such matters. She knew that everyone in the Navy Command and her staff had made the impossible and mustered the forces needed to destroy this world-ender of an enemy. She got up and headed out of the war room and to the bridge.

\*\*\*\*\*

The massive Diamant Dwarfs’ fleet sat on the ever-shifting sands of the Friedlich Sea, ready to pounce. Ships all over the fleet, alongside crews, staff, Kapitäns, and Fleet Admiral, watch the Catacombs of Vilir with intense fervor, letting nothing escape their sight. Yet, as they watched the Catacombs intensely, eyes above the sky watched them with curiosity and puzzlement.

At the Der Fluch meiner Feinde’s bridge, the flagship of the fleet, Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread, watched her pocket watch, waiting for the time of the operation to begin. The watch hands hit the appointed time; putting her watch away, the Fleet Admiral spoke.

“Began the first volley.”

Her words were carried out throughout the fleet. Women and men alike began to move, checking their instruments one last time before firing. Cannons of different sizes started to roar. 16, 10, and 5-inch cannons illuminated the night sky of the Friedlich Sea. Shells weighing 1.5 tons flew at 1,700 miles per hour at their target. Soon, the shells reach their target. Their kinetic force pierced through bedrock and pillars alike, and then their explosive magical payload exploded. As the explosion rips and tears anything inside the Catacombs, other shells arrive, showering everything in shrapnel and magical fire. For the next 15 minutes, the night around the Catacombs of Vilir turns to day.

The cannons across the fleet began to slow down and eventually stop firing. At the fleet's rear, the sound of engines screams into the night. Thousands of aircraft flew towards the Catacombs, carrying powerful magical bombs. Pilots guided their aircraft with precision. Co-pilots work with their instruments to calculate and check their drop zone. The first wave of aircraft reached the Catacombs, and they began their dive. They dive fast and with a purpose; the pilots keep their craft true and steady, ensuring they give the best angle to their co-pilot. With their calculation done, the co-pilots zero in on their target and let their payload fly. Feeling the weight of the bombs leaving their aircraft, every pilot pulls hard on the yoke and rises into the night sky. The fires of the previous volley still burned, turning rock into glass, which was soon bellowed and turned glass into ash. More and more aircraft came screaming down at the Catacombs of Vilir. The fires that burned created strong and powerful wind drafts that made it difficult for the aircraft to fly, but the pilots with wills as strong as Adamantite flew their craft toward their target. Bombs continue to rain, bathing everything and anything in the Catacombs. The last aircraft released its bomb, adding its deadly fuel to the inferno roaring below.

Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread stood with her hands behind her back, watching from the bridge of her ship the burning fires that are the Catacombs of Vilir. For the past hour, the payload they had dropped equal to more than ⅗ of their total national ammunition armament, and by the end of this operation, their ammunition would be gone. Something that made the Fleet Admiral squeeze her hand. If the Helfman were to attack, she was afraid that she would be forced to use the Sun bomb.

“Fleet Admiral! Scout aircraft report no sighting of an undead army or mist!”

Fleet Admiral Hegragora Spinebreakerbread just nodded in reply to her Radio Operator. For the next 8 hours, she would be on the bridge watching the fires burn and eventually die down until she knew her vigil wasn’t needed. But as the Fleet Admiral watched, eyes above the skies of Cristilia watched her and her fleet with concern about the meaning behind the attack.

\*\*

At the Command Center, Second in Command Siñileya wondered if she should wake Supreme Commander Yesleta and notify her of the current event. They had collected enough data about the attack and the attackers' firepower but not the reason for the attack, which left her wondering. Deciding to have all the data available before waking the Supreme Commander. Siñileya turns her gaze to another member of the Command Center, An Armitito female. She orders her to send a level 5 recon prep to the night shift Team Members. The Armitito female began to record the order and type it. As crew members work, Siñileya receives a private message on her tablet. Grabbing her tablet, Siñileya opens the message. It was only text, with a few words: I’m watching. She didn’t need to find out who sent her the text as the only one capable of sending that type of message was Gab\`riel. Putting her tablet down, Siñileya returned to work and paid close attention to the events surrounding the crash site.

\*\*\*\*\*

For the past hour, Gabriel had kept an eye on the events happening at the crash site. Something he wished he didn’t have to as his date with Syl’vainette was going wonderfully, and by how things were going, it too would end wonderfully 😘 if things went his way for once, which typically don’t…. He mentally sighed. He really wanted to go back to the time those assholes didn’t fuck his date up. It brought him joy just thinking about it when he arrived at the Rec Unit.

Arriving at the Rec Unit 15 minutes before the appointed time like any Marine worth their crayons. He was greeted by a well-dressed and immaculate young Chichipi man who spoke to him and guided him to a balcony overlooking the lake that shone with the stars and reflected the gas giant Cristilia orbited. The sight was breathtaking, but not as much as Syl’vainette. She wore an elegant purple shirt that came down to her midriff with intricate patterns woven with a silver color metal that Gabriel could tell was the offshoot of titanium or what they called Mithril in the Empire. Syl’vainette waved at him happily with one hand and placed a tablet down with the other, and Gabriel noticed that the lace sleeve of her shirt had woven patterns representing the Zùlinpus Household. As he approached the table, the young Chichipi man stopped following him and stood to the side.

“Notlà zoht zintlé, you know a gentle and proper male should always arrive at the appointed time. What would other females think of me if I had failed to finish the preparation for our time together.”

Syl’vainette said with a mischievous tone as she stood before her mate-to-be. Gabriel chuckled and noticed the skin-tight, replicated black leather pants and belt she wore, which completely matched her.

“I doubt you didn’t have this place prepared a day prior and alongside a little surprise.”

Gabriel said as he hugged her and gave her a small kiss. The kiss was short and sweet, and soon, the 2 parted ways.

“Is one of your Gifts the ability to see the future?”

Syl’vainette said as she pulled a bouquet from behind her back. Gabriel grabbed the beautiful purple flowers, which gave off a gentle glow. He pulled the bouquet closer to his face and took a deep whiff of the fragrance. After living for 147 Terran years and traveling to other Dimensions where time could be anything, Gabriel still found things that surprised him, like the smell of these flowers.

“Oh my, what lovely flowers.”

Gabriel said as he pulled one flower from the bouquet and placed it on his corset front chest. Syl’vainette giggled, hearing his comment while she used her Essence to pull one of the chairs. Grabbing Gabriel’s hand, she guided him to the chair. He sat on the chair, contradicting Syl’vainette’s sizes and build; she easily pushed Gabriel closer to the table with ease. With her task done, Syl’vainette went to her chair and sat down, but before she could move the chair herself, the chair began to move. She wasn’t surprised as she knew who was kind enough to pull in her chair. Seeing the pair seated, the young Chichipi man, who stood on the side, walked to the tablet and stood with grace before them both.

“Good evening, my name is Ruleshta. I’ll be your attendee for the night. For starters, we have a collection of black mi-eil that is quite popular among the crew, brooded with unique and distinct ingredients picked by Team 99.”

The now-named young Chichipi man said as he showed a 3D display with different names for the black mi-eil. Gabriel and Syl’vainette looked at the various choices before they made their pick.

“The Midnight claw, for me, gentle male. What about you, Notlà zoht zintlè?”

Syl’vainette ask.

“The leg splitter for me, please.”

Gabriel said.

“At once.”

Ruleshta said as he had both of their orders. Turning off the display, the young man turned around and headed to grab the requested drinks, leaving the 2 lovers alone. As they sat, Gabriel noticed the subtle glances Syl’vainette was giving him, which he gladly returned, minus the subtleness.

“You look quite ravishing.”

Gabriel said as he took in the unique beauty of Syl’vainette. She wasn’t like other women of her species. She wasn’t as tall, only 6’5ft compared to the average 10 to 12ft tall woman. Her body wasn’t muscular or very lean. The way he would describe her body would be quite petite. Even other members of the Empire whose bodies have comparable body sizes to hers couldn’t match Syl’vainette’s unique body.

“Oh, says the one that makes luzchirterni pale in comparison with his beauty.”

Gabriel smiled when he heard Syl’vainette’s flirtatious words. When they were alone or on a date, Syl’vainette would recite poetry to him. Which, on several occasions, made him blush. Her words were a breath of fresh air compared to what the other girls would say to him.

“Oh, please, you say that to every pretty male you meet.”

Gabriel said with a playful and flirty smile.

“Only to the ones that made me a Duchess and helped me become my true self.”

Syl’vainette said with a smirk. Gabriel could only smile. Hearing the comeback, he moves his hand across the table and grabs her hand.

“Then that makes me one of the few lucky ones, so tell me, what do you have planned for tonight, ***mi luz de luna***?”

“Oh, and here I thought you already knew what I had planned?”

Syl’vainette said as she intertwined her fingers with Gabriel’s.

“Now, why would I do that? That would ruin your hard work and time spent preparing all of this. Plus, I love surprises.”

Syl’vainette could only roll her eyes at Gabriel’s response.

“All you have to do is wait for our attendee, Ruleshta, to return, and you’ll see what I have for you.”

Syl’vainette said as she leaned over and kissed him. Gabriel closed his eyes and began to probe Syl’vainette’s mouth, which she let him do gladly. The 2 kissed for a while but stopped when they heard several steps approaching. Turning to the sound, Gabriel notices Ruleshta carrying their drinks in a tray, but behind him is a group of crew members carrying different instruments with oddly familiar yet alien outfits. As they got closer, Gabriel’s eyes widened. The outfit might be alien, but he could recognize a Charro outfit anywhere. Ruleshta placed the drinks down and began to speak.

“For this evening's entertainment, we have a special performance by the staff of the Rec Unit. Please enjoy.”

As soon as he stopped speaking, the crew member began to play their instruments. The instruments were a bit different, but Gabriel could recognize their tune: a violin, trumpets, vihuela, and guitarron. As he was mesmerized by the familiar tunes before him, a voice behind him began to sing.

[“***Yo no he perdido la esperanza de tenerte entre mis brazos Y ese día ha de llegar.”***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMrKmDeR7sA&ab_channel=MariachiReal)  

***(***[***translation***](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/me-gustas-mucho-i-you-so-much.html-1)***)*** 

Gabriel turned around and saw Syl’vainette singing to him in Terran.

“***Desde hace mucho que me gustas Y lo que me gusta obtengo Con toda seguridad.”***

To say he wasn’t surprised would be a bald-faced lie. Sure, Terran languages didn’t have the complexity or syntax of the Empire language. Still, it did have countless accents, making learning one accent hard, yet here and now, Syl’vainette wasn’t just speaking. She was singing.

“***Yo no he perdido la esperanza. De que un día tú me quieras. Y algún día me querrás.”***

As she sang, Syl’vainette moved around the table and stood before Gabriel. She places her hand under his chin and gently caresses his cheek with her thumb.

“***Tarde o temprano serás mío. Yo seré tuya algún día. Y lo tengo que lograr”***

Gabriel was now beguiled by the lemon color eyes staring at him. Syl’vainette might not have the two-way sound communication Gene Mod, but he could tell she was putting a lot of effort into singing to him, which he would return in kind.

“***Que conste amor que ya. Te lo advertí que no. Descansaré hasta que seas mío no más.”***

The 2 began to sing. Their voices echo across the Rec Unit and the night sky.

“***Pues tú me gustas de hace tiempo. Mucho tiempo atrás.”***

Syl’vainette pulled her hand away from Gabriel’s face and took a few steps back. Gabriel got up and stood before her, locking eyes and smiling.

“***Me gustas mucho. Me gustas mucho tú. Tarde o temprano seré tuya. Y mío tú serás.”***

They both began to sing to each other, neither taking the lead content on their harmony.

“***Me gustas mucho. Me gustas mucho tú. Tarde o temprano seré tuya. Y mío tú serás.”***

As they sang, the emotions of Gabriel's two-way communication began to resonate, making those hearing it feel the emotions behind it.

“***Que conste amor que ya. Te lo advertí que no. Descansaré hasta que seas mío no más.”***

As they continued to sing, Gabriel grabbed Syl’vainette by the waist and began to dance to the song's tune.

“***Pues tú me gustas de hace tiempo. Mucho tiempo atrás.”***

“***Me gustas mucho. Me gustas mucho tú. Tarde o temprano seré tuya. Y mío tú serás.”***

“***Me gustas mucho. Me gustas mucho tú. Tarde o temprano seré tuya. Y mío tú serás.”***

The crew began to slow down and finish with great gusto, and they began to applaud. Gabriel and Syl’vainette parted ways, but not before taking a quick kiss.

“Ahaha, ok, I am utterly surprised. When did you learn Terran, and how?”

Gabriel said as he grabbed his drink and drank it down.

“It wasn’t easy hiding it from you, yet we did it. After the talks we had about your Pride and its rules. I spend time with Tlèn sè siu atl Yesleta, learning about your likes, tastes, cradle tongue, and much more. We believe you have caught on to our little surprise a few times when you “pop” in suddenly.”

Syl’vainette replies as she giggles about her surprise and how close she was to getting caught, making Gabriel laugh again. It never occurred to him that someone would try to learn Terran. Sure, some of the girls might’ve gone that route to get into his pants, but that is if they had time to do so. As it stands, no one had the time to learn, making what Syl’vainette did a great sacrifice on her part.

“Come here, you!”

Gabriel said as he picked her up and kissed her.

“I’m happy for what you did, but that doesn’t mean you got to overwork yourself for me.”

Gabriel said as he held Syl’vainette under butt cheeks.

“Haha, I know you’ll be surprised. Notlà zoht zintlé. And there is no need to worry about me. As a member of the upper echelons of the Empire, learning the cradle home tongue of other species is a must if you want to sweeten the ears of those who listen and save yourself from a claw to the back.”

Syl’vainette said as she giggled happily. Gabriel raised one of his eyebrows and smiled. He knew he wasn’t dreaming, thanks to all the sessions he had put in with Zè. Yet he couldn’t believe that someone besides Yesleta would put so much effort into him in the situation they found themselves in. Giving Syl’vainette one last kiss, Gabriel placed her down and spoke.

“Thank you for this. I really appreciate it.”

Gabriel said with a big smile on his face.

“There is no need to thank me, Notlà zoht zintlé, as there is more for you to enjoy.”

Syl’vainette said with a prideful and joyful smile. Before Gabriel could ask what she meant, a hover cart with several plates of food was being pushed toward their table. The smell was alien yet mouth-watering, with a hint of spices.

“I tried to replicate the food you had cooked for me before with a bit of a twist.”

Looking at the hover cart, Gabriel saw a plate of tacos with golden-colored meat. The meat was easy for him to recognize as it belonged to a decent-sized aquatic creature. If his memory was correct, which was always the case, the creature looked like an old Terran animal, a crustacean called a crawfish. A plate beside it had what looked like birria ramen, followed by massive cook ribs that took a large portion of the cart. Other plates darted the cart with different food and salads. He liked cooking as it was one of the oldest arts Humanity had created and could constantly evolve into something new. But as much as he wanted to cook, Gabriel didn’t mind when someone else cooked, even more so when that someone was cooking for him.

“Thank you. Now, Let's eat!”

Gabriel said with a big smile as he grabbed Syl’vainette by her hand and sat her on his lap. Syl’vainette smiled happily and sat on Gabriel’s lap, enjoying the moment. As the 2 lovers sat happily, the crew member of the Rec Unit began to play another song while Ruleshta began to prepare a plate for them both.

\*\*\*

Now, after a few songs, good food, and time well spent with Syl’vainette, there was a growing worry in the pit of his stomach thanks to those damn fuckers that glassed the crash site and were just sitting there with whatever they had for a thumb up their ass. Sure, the scan shows they could not reach the Command Center or the Island they found themselves on, but that

didn’t mean that this Planet wouldn’t throw a curve ball at them. Gabriey just wanted to plasma that area and get over with it.

“Notlà zoht zintlé, this night of glee and bliss has brought me great joy, yet I yearn to love you in secret between shadow and soul.”

All mental processes stop and[ crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeA_Y0FSv5Q&ab_channel=SoundEffectsRock), leaving Gabriel in a[ daze](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611jwn03vkmuh2xuxr7tx1ifh8ff384x3dm5itbb423&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g).

“Have my words stolen your ability to speak Notlà zoht zintlé? Then let me write a new language on your body, one that even in silence can be spoken.”

Syl’vainette’s passionate poem rebooted Gabriel’s brain. Turning his gaze to her, Gabriel saw an ardent Syl’vainette whose eyes lusted for him. The date was fun; they danced, sang, ate, laughed, and let their feelings know. Now, all that was left was for their bodies to be explored.

“Teach me this new language of yours.”

Gabriel said as he grabbed Syl’vainette by the hand and began to guide her out of the Rec Unit. Sure, he didn’t know what the next few minutes or hours would bring, but he could make an educated guess with the information he had, which meant that for the next 6 hours or so, he would be rocking Syl’vainette’s insides.              "

The next day, El Burro loaded its cargo. Jenna stood by with her datapad, scanning through the cargo list. Ration packs, mechanical components, various civilian tech—nothing out of the ordinary.

“¿Todo en orden?” Jefe asked, strolling up beside her with his usual carefree demeanor.

“Um, yes,” Jenna replied, still staring at the list. “It appears everything is accounted for. Maintenance is complete, too.”

Jefe gave her a nod, his hands casually resting on his hips. “Excelente, just as I had hoped. Muy bien.”

But Jenna couldn’t let it go. She glanced up at him, a question lingering in her mind. “Jefe, I have to ask… why are you still flying this tub? The maintenance budget you gave me to work with—”

“Was it not enough?” Jose interrupted, half-joking, a mischievous grin on his face.

Jenna frowned. “That’s just it. There was enough in the budget to practically buy a whole new ship!”

Jefe raised an eyebrow, looking more amused than concerned. “So what’s the problem? I told you we’d take care of whatever you needed, no?”

“Yeah, but why wait so long? Why let it get so bad?”

Jefe waved her concern away with a casual flick of his hand. “Te dije, as I said, we didn’t have a tech.”

Jenna’s frustration flared. “That’s bullshit, capitán. You don’t neglect a ship this badly just because you’re short a tech. There’s more to it.”

Jose sighed, scratching at his chin, but his playful smirk never fully faded. “Maybe, sí. Or maybe we’ve just been waiting for you.”

He shot her a wink, his eyes twinkling with mischief.

Jenna groaned, rubbing her forehead in frustration. “You are going to have to come clean with me eventually.”

“Tal vez, señora,” Jose replied with a shrug, completely nonchalant.

It was clear she wasn’t going to get any more answers today. The conversation was going in circles, and Jefe was too slippery to pin down. Jenna scanned the cargo again—everything seemed innocent enough. Civilian goods, standard components, nothing shady. The maintenance was done. So what was she worried about?

Maybe Jefe’s explanation was genuine. Maybe there really wasn’t anything more to it… or maybe he was just better at hiding things than she thought.

“Tranquila, Jenna,” Jefe said, as if reading her mind. “You’re doing a great job. Now let’s get this cargo moving and get paid, ¿sí?”

Jenna shook her head giving Jefe a resigned smile despite her lingering doubts. “Yes, capitán, let’s.”

The crew sat in the mess hall, digging into their dinner. The journey back to the station had been uneventful thus far, and the mood was light. Takar was picking at his food, while Boris leaned back, already polishing off his meal with a contented grunt. Scott sat across from Jenna, his mandibles clicking occasionally as he carefully manipulated his utensils.

“Excelente work on the ship, Jenna,” Jose remarked between bites. “El Burro hasn’t run this smooth since…”

Takar chuckled, sensing the captain’s pause. “…Since?” he asked with mock inquisitiveness, raising an eyebrow at Jefe.

“Ah, cállate,” Jefe responded, half-laughing as he waved Takar off. “But it’s true, Jenna. El Burro has never been better. Which brings me to our next order of business.”

The room quieted down slightly, all eyes turning to Jose as he leaned back in his chair, his expression growing more serious.

“You mentioned earlier, Jenna, that we had a surplus in our maintenance budget,” he began. “That is, in fact, not the case. When we arrive at the station, I want you to oversee some… ‘upgrades’ that our next client has suggested.”

He paused, sending a data file directly to Jenna’s datapad. She opened it, scanning through the list: stealth field generator, jamming equipment, improved energy shielding, a decoy system, and EM weapons capable of disabling enemy ships.

Jenna’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Um, capitán?” she asked, her voice uncertain.

“What is it, señora?” Jose responded, meeting her gaze. “You can handle this, no?”

“Yes, but…” Jenna hesitated, glancing around the table. “These upgrades—why would we need this for a shipping run? Some of this is cutting-edge military tech. I don’t even know where I’d get it!”

Jose leaned forward, his tone shifting. “The supplies are already procured and waiting for us. Solo tienes que instalarlo y asegurarte de que funcione. Just install it and make sure it works.”

“But Jefe, what is all this for?” Jenna pressed, her tone serious.

“Aye, ¿por qué siempre tienes que presionar, señora?” Jose’s playful demeanor faded, his voice hardening. “I’ve told you before—I will tell you when you need to know.”

“Capitán,” Jenna said, her tone equally serious, “a stealth field generator is not something you just procure. You either got it direct from the TFC or… from the black market. Care to tell me which?”

Jose’s eyes narrowed, his gaze locking onto hers. “Señora,” he began, his voice cold but controlled, “I asked you at the start if you could take commands from me. You said you could. I have not lied to you once. Why do you not trust me?”

He stood up from the table, his gaze sweeping over the rest of the crew. “You see them? They are loyal. They do as I say without question. I can rely on them in an emergency. I know they have my back. You… you continue to question me and my motives.”

The room grew even quieter, the tension thick in the air as the crew watched the exchange.

“I do not understand why,” Jose continued, his voice firm but calm. “When we get back, you will complete the upgrades to El Burro. But then… you will stay behind. Not indefinitely, but for now. You’re not ready for this next run.”

“What?” Jenna’s eyes widened in shock. “You’re dumping me back on the station?”

Jose held up a hand. “Tranquila, mamacita. It’s just temporary. One run, and we’ll be back for you.”

“That’s not fair, Jefe!” Jenna protested. “I’ve done everything you’ve asked. I got the ship back to running smoothly—”

Jose interrupted her, his tone softening but still resolute. “I know you’ve done well, Jenna. Your skills are increíbles, but I need to know that you can follow my orders without hesitation. I can’t have you questioning me out there when things get tough. Not on this run.”

Jenna stood there, speechless, her frustration boiling over but with no outlet.

Jose nodded slowly. “Confía en mí. You’ll sit this one out. But we’ll be back for you. Just one run.”

Jenna’s fists clenched at her sides, but she swallowed her protest. She glanced around the table at the other crew members, all of whom were watching her closely. Even Scott’s usual clicks had gone silent.

“Fine,” she finally muttered, sitting back down and staring at the datapad in front of her.

Jose gave her a small nod, his demeanor softening just a little. “Muy bien. Let’s finish this meal. We have a busy day tomorrow.”

The crew slowly returned to their meals, the previous lightheartedness now replaced with an underlying tension. Jenna poked at her food, her mind racing. What exactly was Jefe hiding? What was this run really about?

And why wasn’t she ready for it?

Jenna returned to her bunk, her mind still buzzing with frustration from the conversation with Jefe. What possible need was there for military-grade equipment? A ship equipped like that wasn’t just a simple cargo hauler—it was a stealth military transport. What had the captain told her earlier? Runs back and forth to the station, with the occasional jump into Virexian space? The pieces of the puzzle were mostly there, but something was still missing.

She sat on the edge of her bed, rubbing her temples. Then, a knock at the door interrupted her train of thought.

“Yes?” she called, half-expecting Jose to come in, trying to smooth things over. But it wasn’t him. It was Bear.

“What do you want, Bear?” Jenna asked, her voice tired. “What’s wrong?”

Bear stepped into the small room, his massive frame squeezing through the doorway. He stood there for a moment, his thick arms crossed over his chest. “You and Jefe,” he began, his tone calm but firm. “Why don’t you trust him?”

Jenna sighed. “It feels like he’s hiding something. I don’t like it. I might even be okay with whatever it is, but the fact that he won’t let me in pisses me off.”

Bear nodded thoughtfully. “I get it, Jenna. All of us—except Scott—have been where you are. Wondering what Jefe is hiding.”

Jenna raised an eyebrow. “But not Scott?”

“No,” Bear said, his voice quiet. “Scott carries a different burden. Maybe even heavier than ours. He and the captain go back… let’s just say before El Burro. There’s history there. Bigger than this ship.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Jenna asked, leaning forward, intrigued.

Bear scratched his chin, taking a moment. “Scott and the captain? They’ve known each other for a long time. I don’t know much, but I believe Scott may even be the reason we have El Burro.”

Jenna blinked, surprised. “What? Scott’s the reason we have this ship?”

Bear nodded, his expression serious. “Yeah. I can’t say more than that, but Scott plays a vital role here. You could say he’s part of our purpose. That maintenance budget you mentioned? I bet Scott knows where it came from.”

Jenna’s head spun with questions. “So you’re telling me… Scott and Jefe are doing something bigger than just transporting cargo?”

Bear shrugged. “Bigger, yes. You can trust that El Burro is doing more good than you think. Jefe’s a good man, Jenna. He hasn’t led us wrong yet. Trust him.”

Jenna stared at Bear, trying to process everything he was telling her. His words were simple but carried a weight of experience and loyalty.

Bear gave her a small, reassuring smile. “You’re strong, Jenna. You’re good at what you do. Trust the captain. He’ll let you in when the time’s right.”

His words quieted her worries. Bear had spoken plainly, with the kind of steady reassurance she had needed.

Jenna nodded slowly. “Alright, Bear. I’ll trust him. For now.”

Bear smiled, then turned to leave the room. “Good. Get some rest. We’ve got work ahead.”

Jenna watched him go, the door sliding shut behind him. She felt the tension begin to ease, just a little. Maybe trusting Jefe was the right call after all.

The next morning, Jenna was busy preparing *El Burro* for their FTL jump back to the station. She meticulously checked the FTL engine’s connections, ensuring nothing had vibrated loose after the overhaul. Everything was in order, and after calculating the necessary energy consumption for the flight, she gave the all-clear to Jefe.

“*Ok*, here we go!” Jefe called out, his hand hovering over the controls.

With a flick of his wrist, he punched the FTL drive into gear. The ship lurched forward, slipping into its warp bubble and skipping across the higher dimensions of space. It was over quickly enough, and they dropped out of warp just a half-hour out from the station.

As soon as they arrived, a familiar voice crackled over the comms.

“*Welcome back to the system, Captain Rodriguez,*” came the TTC agent’s voice.

“*Buenos días, Señor Einarsson!*” Jefe replied, his tone overly cheerful. “*Cómo estás, amigo?*”

“Don’t give me that *amigo* bullshit, Jose,” the TTC agent shot back, clearly unimpressed. “What are you smuggling in today?”

Jenna felt her stomach drop, her face paling as her suspicions were seemingly confirmed. *I knew it,* she thought. The captain had been acting shady, and this TTC agent apparently knew it too.

Jefe, however, remained completely unfazed. “Ah, *Jón*, you worry too much,” he said smoothly. “Nothing but the regular *basura* today.”

“*Basura*, huh?” Jón replied, his tone skeptical. “You mean you aren’t going to make good on our... arrangement?”

“*Ah, por supuesto*, why didn’t you just ask?” Jefe chuckled. “I knew there was a reason you met us all the way out here!”

“You mean I can’t just stop by to say hi?”

“With you, it’s never just *hi*,” Jefe said, grinning. “Come aboard, before you raise eyebrows out here.”

The connection cut off, and moments later, the airlock proximity alarm beeped, signaling the arrival of the TTC vessel. A chime sounded as the airlock sealed against *El Burro*, and soon after, Jón Einarsson, the TTC agent, climbed aboard.

He was a tall Terran with blond hair and sharp blue eyes, his demeanor calm and all business.

“*Ah, amigo*, welcome to *El Burro*! It’s been too long,” Jefe said, greeting him with his usual exuberance.

“The ship’s looking good, Jose,” Jón remarked, glancing around.

“*Gracias*, we have our newest crew member Jenna to thank for that. She’s whipped us back into shape.”

Jón turned to Jenna, giving her a brief nod. “So you’re ready for your next... run?”

“*Sí, señor*, or we will be,” Jefe responded.

“*Will be*?”

“*Sí*. We still have to install the recommended upgrades. The port on Ganymede wasn’t discrete enough, if you know what I mean.”

Jón nodded. “Makes sense. You never know who might be watching there.”

“*Exactamente*. The station is much more secure and... controlled.”

“Very well,” Jón said, his voice dropping slightly. “Now, about my... stuff.”

Jefe grinned, reaching into his jacket and brandishing a small bottle of amber liquid. He held it up as if it were a prized artifact.

Jenna frowned, confused. “Is that... whiskey?” she asked.

Jón gasped theatrically. “*How dare you*!” he exclaimed, feigning outrage. “This is *bourbon*! And not just any bourbon. This is a bottle of Woodford Reserve, bottled on Terra in the early 2000s. One of the last in existence. This bottle is worth a small fortune!”

Jenna blinked, dumbfounded. “This is what all the cloak and dagger was for?”

Both Jón and Jefe burst out laughing. “*Sí, Jenna*,” Jefe said, wiping a tear from his eye. “Again, you have nothing to worry about.”

Jenna crossed her arms, clearly still not convinced. “Whatever,” she muttered. “Just let me know when we get to the station.”

With a playful wave, Jefe and Jón wandered off, catching up on old times before Jón departed. A few minutes later, the ship arrived at the station, and the hustle of docking procedures began.

Jenna remained behind, shaking her head. Bourbon? All that secrecy over a bottle of bourbon? No, there was more to it than that. She could feel it. For now, she would play by the captain’s rules, but she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As the ship was moved to dry dock for the installation of the new systems, Jenna decided to track down Tavis. It had been a while since she had last seen her old friend, especially with the extended maintenance on Ganymede. They were well beyond their usual monthly check-ins, but finding him wouldn’t be hard. Tavis was a creature of habit.

It was 17:30 station time, which meant Tavis was likely chatting with Takar at the Portside Drift, the local watering hole. Jenna smiled to herself and hurried there, eager to catch up.

Sure enough, as soon as she walked in, she heard Tavis’s familiar voice calling out to her from the bar. “Jenna!”

She grinned and made her way over. “Tavis, weren’t you in that exact same spot the last time I saw you?”

He raised an eyebrow. “No, if you remember, I was elbow deep in a POS Lacaird fighter.”

“Ah, right,” she said with a chuckle. “How are things?”

“Oh, you know. Same shit, different day,” Tavis replied, taking a sip of his drink. “Just counting down the days left on my contract. You?”

“Just getting ditched stationside for being an ass,” Jenna said, leaning on the bar.

Tavis gave a knowing nod. “Eh, you’ll have that.”

Jenna couldn’t help but laugh. It was so typical of Tavis not to pry or ask for more information than she was willing to give. But this time, she wanted to vent.

“Don’t you want to know what happened?” she asked, a bit eager to have someone to commiserate with.

Tavis smirked. “I could take a guess.”

Jenna groaned. “I hate it when you do this. Fine, you tell me what happened.”

Tavis leaned back, tapping his chin thoughtfully. “Let’s see… You gave Jose a bunch of shit, and now he’s leaving you here as punishment… No, wait, too vague. You’re suspicious about why he’s equipping El Burro as a stealth freighter, confronted him about it, and now he feels like you’re questioning him and can’t trust you. So, he’s leaving you here either to, one, teach you a lesson, or two, because he’s up to something and thinks you’re not ready for it yet.”

Jenna blinked, completely taken aback by how accurate his guess was. “How do you do that?”

Tavis shrugged. “Do what?”

“Guess like that,” Jenna said, half-laughing, half-frustrated.

He grinned. “Not sure. It just makes sense. I heard about the stealth field generator. This is a small station, Jenna. People talk.”

“Sure,” Jenna muttered, her mind racing. “So do you know what Jose’s really up to? He tried to play it off as a bottle of bourbon, but I know it’s more than that.”

Tavis nodded, his expression more serious now. “Yes, Jenna. It’s far more than that. But Jose’s right—you might not be ready for it.”

Jenna was about to press him when Tavis suddenly changed the subject. “How are things with you and Scott?”

“What?” Jenna blinked at the sudden shift. “Uh… fine, I guess. Why?”

Tavis leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. “I know he fought in the war. Even on Cestus V. Did you know he left the Hegemony after that battle?”

“Yeah, we discussed it,” Jenna replied, still unsure where this was going.

“Good,” Tavis said, nodding. He took another sip of his drink.

Jenna frowned. “Tavis, what does that have to do with anything?”

Tavis looked at her thoughtfully, as if weighing his next words. “Jenna, I can’t be the one to tell you. But El Burro… it serves a higher purpose.”

Jenna groaned, her frustration resurfacing. “So people keep saying! Is anyone going to tell me what that is?”

“Probably,” Tavis said with a grin.

“But not you,” Jenna added, narrowing her eyes.

Tavis chuckled. “No, not me. Not my place.”

Jenna huffed, clearly annoyed, but she couldn’t stay mad at Tavis. He had that way about him, always calm, always sure of himself.

He smiled warmly. “Listen, Jenna, I think you’ll be happy when they finally tell you. It’s the reason I recommended you for this crew. Trust Jose—he’s a good one.”

Jenna sighed, leaning back against the bar. “I hope you’re right.”

“I usually am,” Tavis said, giving her a wink.

Jenna rolled her eyes, despite her frustration, she couldn’t help but feel a bit reassured. If Tavis trusted Jose, maybe she could too.

""... Oh welcome back, your usual right? I suppose you want to hear that story then. Alright, if you insist.""

I walked into the camp's yard to meet my assigned squad, unsure of how I'll be greeted. It was a small recon team meant for infiltration. I was approached by one of my squamates and she greeted me warmly.

Sally: ""Hey, I'm Corporal Sally Roxana, I'm in charge of the intel for the squad. You're our new mage McAllister, right?""

Fran: ""Yeah, Mage Francis McAllister, reporting.""

Sally: ""Great, let me introduce you to the squad, we're still waiting on the new cleric though...""

I was quickly introduced to the team, all seasoned soldiers of combat. I wondered how I would fare in the field. Then the cleric showed up. Despite everything, he looked happy and smiling. I feared what the the hell scape of war would do to him.

Mel: ""Cleric Melvin Chevron, reporting.""

Sally: ""Alright that's everyone, line it up, Sergeant will be here in 3.""

Right on que, the Sergeant showed up calling us to attention, ready to dress down the new recruits.

Ripley: ""Stand to and line up! Mage, front and center... Are you able to perform the stealth and ward magic I require for this team?""

Fran: ""Sir, no Sir. I specialize in combat magic sir.""

Ripley: ""What do you mean 'combat specialist'? Combat magic has been outdated for centuries now. Cleric, for the love of god, tell me you know healing magic.""

Mel: ""Sir, yes Sir.""

Ripley: ""At least that's one good thing. Tell me war mage, what can you do that this high precision rifle can not.""

Fran: ""Sir, I use fire and electrical based spells, Sir.""

Ripley: ""Well ain't that some flashy shit. Like it or not, I'm stuck with you. The paper work to swap you out would be a pain in the ass. So price yourself or die on the battlefield mage. Move out, we ship out to the Ristan front.""

Sally: ""Don't worry guys, he's tough on everyone... Oh and be prepared, the Ristan front is as bad as it gets.""

We moved out to the cargo plane headed south.

Mel: ""So, another magic user huh? And you know actual combat magic! That's like, super rare!""

Fran: ""You thinks so? It's not hard it's just... With the way the world is, people just don't see a need for it so why bother training in it.""

Mel: ""I can't wait to see what you can do on the battle field.""

Fran: ""Thanks for the vote of confidence man.""

Mel: ""Call me Mel.""

Fran: ""Fran, I got a good feeling about you Mel.""

We boarded the cargo plane, never to see our homes again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 2: Trenches

The explosive shells sailed over head and bullets whipped past me as I dive into a blown out crater with two others.

Sally: ""You boys okay?""

Mel: ""As good as ever, ma'am.""

Fran: ""I'm not dead yet, so...""

I glance over at them, despite a year of hellish defensive operations, Mel kept his smile through it all. How he stayed so optimistic I'll never know. The Sergeant slid into the crater with us.

Ripley: ""Looks like it's just the four of us. Y'all know the plan. Punch a hole in their line and hold till others move in to secure. Move, move, move!""

The four of us jumped out and charged forward, quickly closing the the gap. I ready myself, prepping my spell to clear the trench. I tackle someone down as I jump in, my knife buried into their neck as they lay on the ground.

I raised my hands to cover the right flank as Mel jumped in behind me. Hot sparks of fire crackles in the palms of my hands as I move down the line.

Mel: ""I'm counting on you buddy, not much of a fighter but I got your back.""

Fran: ""Stay close and watch out then.""

We caught several soldiers unaware on the firing step, with a quick incantation flames shot forth and engulfed them. They all screamed in agony as they burned, haunting me but I had to move on. The only solace was knowing they would not show mercy towards me either.

As we went, incinerating everything in my path, we made a foot hold big enough for our allies to pile in and route the enemy forces. We were brought back to rest and heal.

Ripley: ""Nicely done mage, guess you have some use.""

Sally: ""That's damn near praise coming from him, well done Fran.""

As we walked along, Mel hung close by to me. He could see my hands shaking. He patted my shoulder.

Mel: ""Hey, relax man. Deep breaths, you were fine out there. Nothing to be caught up on.""

Fran: ""Y-yeah, your right...""

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 3: Survival

It's dark... everything is so cold... and quiet, so quiet... and nothing? No, there's something... my body maybe, but what is that feeling? It's the ground, I'm on my back... why am I laying on the ground? Is that pain? Why am I in pain? I thought, right... that artillery strike landed by me, I remember now. I may have died then, but why... I'm still thinking, and the pain is there... so maybe then...

I tiredly open my eyes, my vision a messy haze as it slowly clears. Above me, I could swear I saw an angel with the sweetest smile. My chest hurt, the angel was repeatedly pressing down on my chest over and over before leaning in to... kiss me? No, he's blowing into my lungs... this is just basic CPR, so maybe I did die.

My eyes open wider, there's a ringing in my ears that wasn't there before. It was quiet but now the ringing is all I hear. I look back up to the angel and... it's Mel. He sees my eyes are open, he's smiling and crying. He seems to say something but I can't hear him over the ringing. He pushes my up, I feel the ground shaking and vibrating... the artillery strike isn't over. I have to move, I'm ... I'm not ready... I'm not ready to die yet! I must fight, I must survive, I must get up and move! I won't die here like this!

I stumble up as Mel holds my close. He feels so warm compared to me. He drags me to feet and out of the crater, what could have been my grave. I feel my mind fading, it's getting dark again, but I have to move, I have to survive. I must fight to live, I can't die here...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 4: Recovery

*Beep*

Where am I?

*Beep*

What happened?

*Beep*

Fight... I must fight...

*Beep*

Fight to survive...

*Beep*

Can't die...

*Beep*

My body... feels heavy...

*Beep*

My hand... something is holding my hand...

*Beep*

And that constant beeping sound... so annoying...

*Beep*

Someone is talking...

*Beep*

I open my eyes and look around. I'm in the infirmary, hooked up to various things. Mel is holding my hand as he leans over and sleeps on me from a chair. I nudge him awake.

Fran: ""What happened?""

Mel: ""Y-You're awake! You've been out for a few days now. There was a second artillery strike that went off next to us... I thought you died...""

Fran: ""Well, I'm alive... thanks to you.""

Mel: ""I guess it's for all the times you saved me. It was my turn to save you.""

Fran: ""Wait, when did I save you?""

Mel: ""Oh, right. Doctor said that due to the head trauma you might experience some memory loss. What was the last thing to remember?""

Fran: ""... We cleared out that trench and secured a foot hold in the enemy lines.""

Mel gets a sad look on his face before speaking.

Mel: ""Uhm... Francis, that happened three years ago...""

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Act 2: Hard times

Ch 5: Catching up

Fran: ""Wait, what do you mean three years?""

Mel: ""Like I said, you'll have some memory loss. Do you remember... who I am?""

Fran: ""Yeah, Cleric Mel Chevron, 2nd recon squad.""

Mel: ""I see... Do you remember anyone else?""

Fran: ""... There's Sally and... Ripley...""

Mel: *Shakes his head* ""He's been dead for a year. Here, it's your journal you've been keeping... figured somethings would be easier to process if it was coming from yourself.""

Fran: ""Yeah, thanks. I'll have to give it a look through.""

After Mel left, I read through the journal. I was shocked at how brutal the war had gotten but then there were moments where...

Sally: ""Finally awake I see, about damn time. How's your head doing?""

Fran: ""Oh, hi uhm... Okay I guess.""

Sally: ""I'm guessing Mel left already.

Fran: ""Yeah.""

Sally: ""Good, guy needs his sleep. Mel's a really sweet guy, a good one to have on your side... You know he never left your side since you've been in the infirmary? I bet he's out cold now in his bunk, you're lucky to have him Fran.""

Fran: ""Yeah, I guess so... wait, what do you mean by that?""

Sally: ""Oh right the memory loss. Well it'll come back you, but as a spoiler... you two have 'shared' a bunk on a few occasions.""

Sally gave me a devilish grin, leaving me feeling flustered and wondering what have I forgotten?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 6: New powers

We hid in the crater, suppressing fire over head. Several dead and dismembered lay across the field, though I didn't have time to tell who was who. We had to advance, we had to move, the shots were closing in.

Sally: ""Juggernaut, 11 o'clock!""

I look over to see the massive tank, to think we would face one on this lowly front. It's armor was strong, bullets were useless and magic did little. We needed something more powerful than mere fire or electricity. But what, it needed the force to punch through. Speed can help, but it would need mass as well... I considered my options quickly, I thought of a solid beam of metal at incredible speeds, it was the best I had. I would either try it and live, or live long enough to regret trying.

I stood up, aimed my hand and things seemed slow. The recoil rang through my arm as the shot manifested and launched out, leaving an electric pulse in its wake. The sound was deafening and painful like a cannon. The shot punched straight through the front armor where I guessed the driver was. It must have struck the ammo cause it later exploded into flames.

Sally: ""... how the fuckin' he'll... the fuck was that?""

Fran: ""Do know, don't care, tank is dead so let's move.""

Mel: ""Look at you making new spells on the fly, what's next?""

Fran: ""Later, move now.""

We moved forward slowly, crater by crater. The city fortress ahead. We jump into the outer trench network, service pistol in one hand as lightning shoots out the other. By now I've gone cold to the killing, seeing it as something mundane and just another part of life. The screams of pain and the dying, nothing but white noise to me.

Mel: ""Look out!""

Mel tackles me down as a magic bolt rips past both of us. I return with my own flames, engulfing everything in that direction in flames. People fell dead, supplies burned, and ammo cooked off.

Mel: ""Close call, huh.""

Fran: ""Yeah... You can get off me now.""

Mel: ""How cold of you.""

Fran: ""Now isn't exactly the time for that.""

We get up and push towards the the city wall. Leaving no survivors and taking no prisoners. Bullets and magic rang out all day till a breach in the wall was finally made.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 7: Something else

Sitting side by side with Mel, we stayed quiet and enjoyed each other's warmth in the cold city ruins.

Mel: ""...So, any of your memories come back?"" He moved in close, giving me a sly smirk.

Fran: ""If you're asking what I think you're asking... kinda. It's all hazy but... it doesn't matter really. What matters is the here and now, and we have to stick together through it all.""

I wrapped my arm over his shoulder as we leaned into each other. The rain was falling down, deflected by a ward to keep us dry.

Sally: ""Move over lover boys, food is here."" She tossed us both MREs.

I roll my eyes playfully as we all sit together under the cover as we try to stay dry.

Sally: ""We have a new battalion coming in to help take the city... I give 'em two week.""

Fran: ""I'll give 'em one.""

Mel: ""You two need to be more optimistic, I'll give them a month before the break... you two think this war will ever end?""

Fran: ""It's been going for centuries so... I doubt it.""

Mel: ""You never know, it would be nice though... I'd open a quiet little coffee shop. Nothing special, maybe a bakery.""

Fran: ""Keep dreaming hun, we're here for life.""

Mel: ""So long as I have you.""

Sally: ""You two are such the romantic couple.""

Fran: ""I don't mind it. How could you not love that cute smile.""

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 8: Loss

Our position in the city was assaulted. Orders were clear; hold this position, give no inch, the enemy shall not pass. Easier said then done though.

Flames and lightning shot from my hands as artillery shells rained down and cratered the ground. Bullets whizzed pass as they flew to they doomed targets.

Fran: ""Sally, I'm feeling low on mana, toss me that rifle... *bang bang bang* ... Where's our back up!?""

Sally: ""On our front, we'd be lucky to get a memo.""

Mel: ""I got the resupply, reinforcements will here in 20.""

Fran: ""20? We'll barely last 5!""

*CRACK... thud*

Time seemed to stop, I looked over to him, or where he once was I should say. Mel played there, on the ground. I clean bloody hole between his eyes. His helmet was gone, and so was... most of the back of his head.

I don't know how long I knelt there, felt like hours, though it could have only been a few seconds at most.

Fran: ""Mel...""

I reached down and grabbed his tags. Holding them tightly, my mind raced with a million thoughts. There was nothing I could do. Even if I knew healing magic, it has its limits.

I stood up, out of cover of the ruins. Only one thought was in my mind know. I thought of all the pain, death, and destruction this war has caused. I wanted it all to end.

I step towards the enemy positions, my wards flaring as bullets were deflected.

Fran: ""Suffer my wrath and bathe in the flames of Hell!!!""

Flames shot forth from my hands with an intensity I've never felt before. Bodies vaporized and stone turned to slag.

I had lost the last thing that made this living hell bearable and I was certain the enemy would pay for it. The flames grew only hotter and more intense. The attack was routed, but it wasn't enough for me. I chased after them recklessly, lightning and flames striking them down.

I stopped at an overlook, the full city now in view. I'll end this battle, here and now. I stood at the edge, arm outstretched.

Fran: ""Ignite a star and burn in it's fire, detonate.""

I spoke the words calmly, but there was a quiet rage behind each one. A bolt shot out from my hand like a flare as it zipped over the city to the far side. I quietly landed before...

*KABOOM*

Almost instantly the explosion went off. The sound was deafening and the light was blinding. The blast grew larger and larger, wiping out almost but the strongest of bunkers and walls until...

I knelt there, on the cliff side. Looking into the city I had flattened.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Act 3: Numb

Ch 9: Aftermath

Everything had gone quiet. No one talked, no cannons fired, the only sound was the dirt, debris, and god only knows what else falling back to the ground. I knelt at the edge of the crater, the city that was there almost entirely gone.

I stayed there, my anger and grief willing me to do more but I couldn't move. I had no will power, no driving force, no energy... so I just knelt there, too tired to even try moving and my mana so drained I couldn't even try the simplest of cantrips.

I wanted to burn this cruel world of mine. I wanted it to all end, the revenge, the death, anything but this sadness. The tears ran down my face, mixing with the blood and ash. I thought ""What if I just fell forward, into the crater..."".

Just then, Sally found me and grabbed hold of me. She was crying too, I think she was saying something but I couldn't tell.

Later back at camp.

Sally: ""... wasn't there anything you could have done?""

Fran: ""... no.""

Sally: ""But, isn't that what magic is...""

Fran: "" Stop. Please. It doesn't work like that. Healing magic and destruction magic are as opposite as it gets. Even if I had the aptitude for it... the level of knowledge needed for... that, was beyond anything you could find on a battle field.""

We sat in silence for what seemed like hours.

Sally: ""... what... What was that spell you used?""

Fran: ""I don't know.""

Sally: ""What do you mean 'you don't know'?""

Fran: ""They don't teach stuff like that because they deemed it obsolete decades ago. They barely touch on how it all works.""

Sally: ""How does it work?""

Fran: ""Basically, I have to fully imagine what I want and how it'll happen. Not just an idea though, I have to fully comprehend every aspect of it.""

Sally: ""So... If you do that then you can make your own spells?""

Fran: ""Pretty much, yeah.""

Sally: ""... Oh, these are for you... I thought you would want them.""

Sally handed me Mel's tags. I clutched then tightly as I felt myself starting to tear up. I leaned into Sally. As she held and consoled me, I cried quietly into her shoulder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 10: Back Lines

We sat quietly in the base camp, most people staying clear of me.

Sally: ""Heads up. Suit coming through and it looks like they mean business.""

Fran: ""What could they want?""

Sally: ""Considering over half the city was wiped out in one spell... I'm guessing they want you.""

Fran: ""*sigh*... This is going to be good.""

Commissar: ""Mage McAllister and Sergeant Rosana, you are both wanted for questioning.""

We taken away to the rear echelon. We're sat down at a table at a table with a map of the city on it, most of it scratched out in red.

Commissar: ""Do you know what this map is?""

Fran: ""The city we invaded Sir.""

Commissar: ""Any idea what this area is?""

He points to large section marked in red.

Fran: ""It's mainly the south-west sector, it was... annihilated recently in a mass explosion... Sir.""

Commissar: ""Any ideas how, Mage?""

Fran: ""We were ordered to remove the enemy from the city, so i removed them. Sir.""

The commissar leaned in close, his eyes glaring.

Commissar: ""How?""

Fran: ""... Magic. Magic that the colleges abandoned in favor of wards and healing. Sir.""

The commissar grinned a wicked smile.

Commissar: ""Can you do it again?""

And so my research began. Refining the art if war magic. Faster and higher penetrating spells that rip through wards and armor alike. Spells that mimic poison gas if not worse, melting organic material.

For all that, it wasn't enough for them. They wanted more. More death. More destruction. More power.

I was getting ideas. Ideas that Sally and myself shared. I never forgot though, the cruel world we were in. The constant war, the pain I felt.

Between the most recent research project of channeling magic through a material focus, I hid some darker studies. Something I never told Sally and hoped I would never have to use.

My plans were in place, I just needed the right time to act.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 11: Breakthrough

I sat at my research station, my latest concern being materials for use in channeling mana for spells. Some worked better than others while the rest were practically worthless.

Sally: ""Knock knock, how's it going Franky?""

Fran: ""Hm? Oh, fine I guess. It's been over a year now and so far all I have are basic enhancement components and fancy fireworks.""

Sally: ""Don't over work yourself okay.""

Sally hugs me from behind as I sit at my desk. I welcome the comfort she brings me but... I still feel empty.

I pour over my notes when I notice, there are several elements I haven't even tested yet. Most are inaccessible for rarity reasons or extreme hazardous reasons. But if I could get one, maybe I could convince them to getting me the others.

Sally: ""I need everything we have on these elements.""

Sally: ""Hey, don't we use this one as fuel?""

Fran: ""Yeah, in reactors. We also use it in bullets.""

Sally came back with a few books on the radioactive elements. I opened one and started reading through the night.

The one I was after first was uranium. If I could get something going for that, it could lead to other discoveries. Though, I couldn't forget my other project and it's success. I already had a few... 'test' subjects picked out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 12: Doubts

I sat at my desk, pouring over notes from my materials project research. Testing on the latest samples of uranium promising, too promising.

Sally: ""Hey Franky, what do you plan to do with this exactly?""

Fran: ""... I thought I wanted to see the world burn but... That's not what he would have wanted...""

Sally: ""So what now then?""

Fran: ""... Big stick policy? Develop something so powerful the fear of it ends conflicts before they start.""

Sally: ""Do you really think that'll work?""

Fran: ""No...""

Sally: ""... Maybe we could transfer out? Anything but here.""

At that the Commissar walked into the room.

Comm: ""Progress report Mage.""

Fran: ""The materials research has made a breakthrough with latest testing, but...""

Sally: ""We wish to transfer out.""

Comm: ""... Very well, you may leave. You know where the exit is. Well get the paper work started.""

A little stunned we both walked for the door and *BANG*. Blood splattered my face and the door as Sally crumbled to the floor.

Comm: ""Though, I never said you could leave alive. Can't gave secrets getting out now. Mage, you still wish to leave, yes?""

I stood there frozen, my fists clenched and energy rippled through them. I tried to stay calm and chose my words very carefully.

Fran: ""N-no Sir. I was simply see Sally off, Sir.""

Comm: ""Very good, I would hate to lose something as valuable as you. You mentioned a breakthrough? I recommend you focus on that.""

Fran: ""Y-yes, Sir.""

The Commissar left, stepping over the body of Sally and called for a removal team. One of them took the tags off and put them in my hand before taking her away.

I sat down at my desk, tears quietly falling down my face. I had nothing left. I wanted an end to it. I glanced at my notes and I knew what needed to happen.

I delved further into my hidden research of the forbidden and legends of old. It would prove useful for my plans to come. I just need to run some final tests...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 13: Burn it down

A year of research. That's all I could afford. The stress and the hatred towards this hellish world, it all came to this moment. I sat in the bomber, the frame shaking from the turbulence. I was surrounded by a few soldiers... and that Bayard Commissar. That's good though, I want him here for this.

In my hands were two round chunks of metal, one was hollowed out while the other held its matching part. In my research I found better, more potent materials. I looked out the window into the black night. The barren plains bellow spanning for miles, not a city in sight.

I removed the sealing wards on the metal pieces and put them together. The young soldier next to me was talking to me, but I wasn't paying attention. I just simply nodded along to what he said. I felt bad for him, not for what was to come but for being so easily bought into the rhetoric of what leadership wanted.

I quietly started the incantation needed to start my plan. It wasn't the flashy show I told them, it was simple and to the point.

Fran: ""In the black of night, the Sun shall shine. I invoke the might that is mine. I am become War, I become Death. I shall burn the star in one breath. May god show mercy for I have none. This, my legacy shall be gone.""

As I spoke softly, a dark blue glow came from the ball of metal that I held. The Commissar looked over and saw what I was doing. He drew his service pistol and aimed at me.

Comm: ""Mage, stop this immediately!""

Fran: ""Too late assholes, it's gone critical. Not even I could stop it now.""

As I delayed, I kept infusing the mana I could spare into it, trying to maximize the the power of it.

Comm: ""Mage, I am ordering you to reverse what you've done!""

Fran: ""No, I'm done. Shoot me if it makes you feel better, but I've already won.""

I can see him shake slightly in his hand. He's knows what I've done and that there is no stopping it. He's lost all control of the situation. I stand up and step forward till his gun is pressed against my heart.

Fran: ""Tell me, do you fear death, Alik? Do you fear its cold embrace? I welcome it with open arms.""

The shot rang out, my heart punched through. I crumple to the floor of the plane, the glowing core falling out of my hands. Just as I planned.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Act 4: The End

Ch 14: Retribution

When next I opened my eyes, I was in the research lab of the base. It was still night as I checked myself over, my chest having phantom pains.

I looked out the window in time to see it. The dark night turn to day as a small star was created in the far distance before collapsing back in on itself. I ducked down before the shockwave rushed out and blew out the windows.

I knew the blast was roughly seventy five miles away. I can only imagine the destruction it caused.

I double checked myself, or I should say my new host body. I checked my name tag, Samuel. Strange, it should have been Jackson... no matter. I made my way over to the barracks to get to my room. I packed some clothes, my personal notes, and I grabbed the three sets of tags I left behind.

Those years of soul magic research in secret were paying off. The soul transfer worked, though the phantom pain of being shot lingered. I feel drained of my mana, gotta be careful.

I went to the armory and using Samuel's clearance I easily got in. I grab a service pistol, a rifle, and ammo. I next headed to the vault. Anyone in my way now being quietly dispatched.

When I got in, before me were the cores. I grab what would fit in my bag before assembling the rest. I removed the wards and one of them I activated. It would be a while before it detonated, but I wasn't going to be here for it.

I later got to the motor pool, stole a car, and drove away. About an hour or two later, another star was birthed before collapsing in on itself. The shockwave rushing past me again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 15 Hiding

By the time I got to the near by town, the sirens were blaring. Despite the panic, no batted an eye at the random soldier driving through town. I made my way to the shopping area.

When I get there, no one is around. It made things easy. My mana was drained and would be a while to get used to this new body. The phantom pains a reminder of my situation. Breaking into the stores was simple enough, just smashing in a few window and climb through. Simple when compared to the trenches.

I grabbed the basic essentials; clothes, first aid, food. In one store they had books on display and one caught my eye. It was about traveling through worlds in a whimsical fashion meant for kids. I remember it fondly from my childhood. It gave me an idea. Those damn academy fools not even trying.

For now, I went back to the car. I drove off into the forest, ditched the car, and secluded myself away from everything and everyone. I would continue my research into the cores to maximize their potential. Even touching on the idea of jumping from place to place, though it was draining on me.

Every now and then I pulled out the tags of Mel and Sally, to remind myself of why I'm doing this. The time will come when this will all end, no more pain and no more suffering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 16: The World Burns

My preparations were ready. Months of enchanting the cores. The locations have been picked, I just have to enact it.

With the study of teleporting, it would make it easier but it was taxing on me. The timeline would have to be perfect, no room for errors. I can't second guess myself now. Even just three of the six enchanted cores I have the world would burn. The atmosphere itself set ablaze and the fallout killing everything... and everyone... even the innocent, with no discrimination.

No, no second guessing. No doubts. This world is better off dead, this war will never end. How many more innocent souls must be thrown into the meat grinder of war? I must do this, to put an end the this never ending cycle. This is a cursed blessing compared to the war.

I teleport to the first capitol, place the core and activating the magical timer. No going back now. I teleport to the next location, then the next and so on. Placing the cores, starting their timers, and leaving.

Once at the last location, I set the core down. I feel tired and drained. I recite the last incantation, forever dooming this world and condemning all the souls on it to oblivion. May whatever god of death out there show them the mercy they deserve.

The core glows the dark blue like before. I teleport away one last time. I find my self in a forest unlike one I've ever seen. It was actually alive unlike the ones I knew. I found a quiet spot to rest.

My body was heavy and sore... and my mind was worse. Reality hit me hard as I curled up and cried over the horrors I just committed. I've killed before, many a times but this... this was different. It wasn't right but I did it any way.

The next morning, I grabbed my stuff off the ground and teleported back. When I got there the air was heavy and thick with ash and it made my lungs burn. I put on a mask just to mitigate it but it was still hard to breath. Most the oxygen was used up.

I looked over what I could but all I found was burnt ground and the ruins of collapsed buildings still smoldering. There was no going back now, the deed is done.

I was the only one left and must carry that burden.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Epilogue

At McAllister's Brew coffee shop, the store was closed for the first time since opening early this year. It was quiet and dark with a single note on the door that read:

""All usual orders will be sent to the customers via our instant delivery service today. Our lobby is currently closed and we are sorry for the inconvenience. If you would like to place an order you may do so on our Orb-app. We thank you for understanding and we hope you have a wonderful day!""

Meanwhile, Francis can be seen walking around town wearing an old military uniform with a case on his back and buying an elegant floral wreath before heading to the city limits and teleporting away.

On a separate plane of existence, on a planet once wrought with endless war known Thalmora, there was mass cemetery. It was well maintained given the surrounding wasteland it was in. There was one main path that lead through the center of it.

Francis walked down this path like the countless time he had before, looking out at the grave markers. He knew what each one meant, all 19,685,943 of them. There was one for every thousand soul he had personally sent to oblivion. Every so often though, he saw one of the guards standing watch over the dead. The spectral entities protecting the family and friends they once knew in life. Their uniforms were different from one another but it was of no concern. The war was over, they could rest.

At the end of the path, Francis came to the central memorial. I was a simple monument with the inscription:

Thalmora

For the billions of souls lost, may this cemetery be a reminder to look for a better future, a better solution, for a peaceful end.

The soldiers of the damned shall for ever guard these hollowed grounds so the innocent may forever know peace in whatever afterlife awaits them on the other side.

Francis paused to read the inscription before stepping forward to place the wreath at the center. He stepped back observing the four statues, one for each major nation that fought. Guards appeared to form a cordon on either side, they miss matching uniforms even more obvious now. Francis took the case off his back and pulled out a trumpet and played. It was the old call for a funeral, the notes long and drawn out as the sad tune echoed through the cemetery. As he played, the guards performed an about face, turned their rifles to the sky, and fired. *BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG.* The shots making staccato notes to the trumpet's long tones.

When it was over, Francis packed up the trumpet and the guards turned back to face him.

Fran: ""I'm sorry. I am truly and heartfully sorry for what I've done. I don't ask for forgiveness but I hope you have found peace in the afterlife.""

He then signs an old lullaby, it's sad and it's sweet in his warm tone.

Fran:  
Hora serena venit  
Nocte tandem quieta  
Sensus lentus evanescit  
Anima mea placida

Nocturnae aves cantantes  
Tibi melodiam ferunt  
Fletus tuos ego teneo  
Dulcis umbra in somnia

Noli flere mi pulchra  
Lacrimae tuae evanescunt  
In tenebris securus es  
Mane in pace hic mecum

Luna lucem dat miti  
Stellas te inspiciunt  
Angeli te custodiunt  
Somnus te amplexat

Noli flere mi pulchra  
Lacrimae tuae evanescunt  
In tenebris securus es  
Mane in pace hic mecum

Tempus ultra procedit  
Dolor oblitum sit  
In somniis veritas  
Cor tuum delectat

Francis gives a sharp salute with the guards returning the salute back. He turn to leave. As he walks back down the path he pulls out his tags, three of them. Mel Chevron Cleric, Sally Rosana Sgt, and Francis McAllister Mage. Tears dripped down onto the tags, had he been crying this whole time and not noticed till now?

He continued home, to see his daughter Melody and his son Edwin. Though they were both in their late twenties, he spoiled them both and loved them with all his being.

End."

Jenna lay on her new bunk, staring up at the ceiling. The room, though still small, felt like a luxury compared to the shoebox hab unit she’d left behind. Here, she had space—real space. Enough room to stretch out, to walk, to think. She could move freely throughout the ship. Her ship. She was the tech now, a vital crewmember on a spacefaring vessel. The reality of it was finally sinking in, and for the first time in years, she allowed herself to smile.

Earlier, Captain Jose—Jefe, as the crew called him—had introduced her to the rest of the team. She replayed the scene in her head, trying to absorb it all.

Takar, the Saurenai, had been the first to greet her. He was just coming into adulthood, a Saurenai on the cusp of his prime. His vibrant feathers, a bright red and orange, contrasted against his glistening dark scales. Red eyes glowed against his angular face, a stark reminder of the dinosaurs his people had once created on Terra. Strong, intelligent, and full of youthful energy, Takar regarded her with curiosity rather than skepticism. A good start.

Then there was Boris Volkov, or ""Bear,"" as the crew called him. Jenna couldn’t help but feel a twinge of intimidation when she first saw him—an abnormally large Terran, built like a mountain, all muscle and bulk. Yet, despite his hulking size, there was an air of intellect about him. He was the ship’s muscle sure but more important he served as translator, adept at navigating the language barriers that came with an interspecies crew. His job was particularly important when it came to the final member.

Z’karth.

Jenna’s stomach had churned the moment she saw the Virexian. She’d kept her face neutral, but the memories of her world’s destruction had rushed back. Boris had been there to translate, but the mere presence of a Virexian, especially one who had fought in the conflict, was enough to make her blood boil.

The introduction had been awkward.

""Jenna, this is Z’karth,"" Captain Jose had said. ""Though he prefers the name ‘Scott’.""

The Virexian had stood still, his sharp mandibles clicking softly, his multifaceted eyes watching Jenna. His voice was a series of clicks, hisses, and pops—his natural Virexian language incomprehensible to her. Boris, standing beside him, translated.

""Z'karth is a name given to me by the Hegemony. I am no longer of the Hegemony. Call me Scott.""

Jenna had blinked, trying to process the bizarre mix of Virexian sounds and Boris’s deep voice relaying the message.

“Scott?” she had asked, her discomfort evident.

The Virexian’s mandibles clicked again. Boris translated. ""Yes, Scott. The name I choose. Z'karth is a slave name.""

She had nodded stiffly, still struggling with the idea of working alongside a Virexian. The destruction of Cestus V was too fresh, too painful.

Scott had made a soft clicking sound, which Boris quickly translated. ""I can sense you do not trust me. Understandable.""

“You fought in the war,” Jenna had replied bluntly, not bothering to hide her disdain.

Another round of clicks and hisses. ""I fought for the Hegemony, yes. But I am no longer theirs. I am free. Just as you are free from your ruined world.""

The words had hit her like a punch, but before she could respond, Boris had stepped in.

""Hey, easy, both of you,"" Boris had said, his voice calm and steady. “We all have our reasons to be here, and we all have our demons. The war’s behind us.”

“Maybe for you,” Jenna had muttered under her breath.

Captain Jose had placed a hand on her shoulder, his tone more serious than before. “We’re a team here, señora. That means we move forward together. ¿No?”

Jenna had forced herself to nod, the weight of her past clashing with the reality of her new life. She hadn’t wanted to admit it, but Captain Jose was right. She was here now, and that meant she had to figure out how to work with Scott—even if every fiber of her being still held him, and the Virexians, responsible for the devastation of her home.

Now, lying on her new bunk, Jenna replayed the exchange over and over. The war had left scars on everyone, not just her. Sharing a ship with a Virexian—a creature that had once served the Hegemony, the very force that destroyed her world—was going to test her in ways she hadn’t expected.

Outside her door, she could hear Boris’s deep voice rumbling as he and Takar chatted. The soft clicking and occasional hisses from Scott, going about his duties, were also audible in the background.

Jenna sighed, running a hand over her face. El Burro was her chance to start fresh, but how could she leave the past behind when it felt like it was staring her in the face every day?

""One day at a time,"" she whispered to herself, trying to calm the storm brewing inside her.

Her new life aboard El Burro was just beginning. The war may have been behind her, but the healing had only just started.

The next day, Jenna found herself fully immersed in her duties, bringing herself up to speed on the status of El Burro. Captain Jose—Jefe, as the crew called him—was keeping a close eye on her, hovering nearby as she worked, just in case she needed anything. But she didn’t.

“Jefe, please, I’m trying to work,” Jenna said, her tone more exasperated than she intended.

“Lo siento, avísame si necesitas algo,” came his immediate reply, hands raised in mock surrender.

“Whatever that means,” Jenna muttered under her breath. She knew a little Spanish, though not enough to follow Jose’s rapid-fire phrases. Her mother had insisted she take an “Ancient Terran Languages” course back when she was younger, something about becoming a more cultured individual. At the time, Jenna had thought it pointless, but now, she was somewhat grateful. At least she could piece together bits of what Jefe was saying, even if she couldn’t respond fluently.

Only Boris understood him fluently, which made sense given his role as the translator. Jenna still wasn’t entirely sure why Jefe defaulted to Spanish so often, but it added to his charm—and, admittedly, to her occasional frustration.

By lunchtime, Jenna had mapped out all the major wiring paths for the main thrusters and compiled a log of all the available maintenance records. To her dismay, there were shockingly few. She frowned, flipping through the logs.

Well, that explains the lack of dry dock time…

Still, El Burro had been modified and was built like a tank. The ship was equipped with triple-redundant life support and a heavily reinforced hull. It even had several sealable compartments that improved its structural integrity. While these compartments reduced cargo space slightly, they made the vessel vastly more resilient.

After grabbing a quick bite to eat, Jenna returned to her duties, poring over the maintenance logs again.

“Jefe,” Jenna called, her voice carrying through the ship.

“Sí, señora?” came the reply, Jefe poking his head around the corner.

“I’ve been going over the maintenance logs, and, well... it looks like it’s been a long time since these engines have had an overhaul. According to this, we’re way overdue. I’m surprised the TTC hasn’t dry-docked us already.”

Jefe waved off her concern with a casual hand. “Ah, don’t worry about them. They’ll leave us alone. Is there something wrong with the engine dies? Or are they just due for maintenance?”

Jenna crossed her arms, clearly frustrated. “We’re in a starship, Jefe. I’d say there’s something wrong with the engines if we’ve left port without servicing them!” She shook her head. “What if they fail? We could be stranded out here—forever floating in the abyss.”

“Aye, calmate, whey. Don’t get all worked up. Look, you say they need maintenance, we’ll get it done as soon as we hit port. For now, are they good?”

Jenna let out a deep breath, trying to calm herself. “Yes, they’re fine for now. But you owe it to your crew to take care of this, you know? It’s just as important as food, water, or fuel. Except when this goes wrong, we’re really screwed.”

Jefe chuckled, though his tone softened. “Aye, you’re right. Lo siento, prior to now, we didn’t have a tech on board.”

“That much is obvious,” Jenna muttered under her breath.

She finished reviewing the records with Jefe, and once they were squared away, she left to survey the rest of the ship. As she walked down the corridor, she couldn’t help but feel a twinge of satisfaction. El Burro might be an old, stubborn ship, but now it was her responsibility to keep it running smoothly—and she wouldn’t let it fall apart on her watch.

The next week was filled with the monotony of sub-light travel. There was a strict speed limit set within the Sol  system, a relic from the Virexian Conflict. Back then, it had prevented vessels from arriving unannounced, reducing the risk of a sudden attack. Now, it felt more like a hindrance. But breaking that law meant one thing: getting vaporized by the nearest warship or defense platform. Not a risk worth taking.

Jenna used the time to familiarize herself with the ship. She enjoyed walking the halls of El Burro, feeling a growing sense of responsibility for the systems that kept it running. Sometimes, she’d just lie down on the floor and let the subtle vibrations of the ship hum through her body, connecting her to the heartbeat of the vessel.

It was during one of these quiet moments that she felt it—a slight, almost imperceptible change in the warble of the hull. Barely noticeable, but enough to set off alarm bells in her head. She knew something wasn’t right.

Bringing it up to Jefe was her first stop.

""Jefe,"" she began cautiously, ""I think there’s something off with the ship. The vibrations, they’re... different.""

Jefe raised an eyebrow, looking at her like she’d just sprouted a second head. ""I don’t feel nada, señora.""

Jenna frowned, frustrated. She turned to Boris, hoping for backup. “Bear, you feel it, right?”

Boris shrugged, his massive shoulders rising and falling casually. “I do not know, Jenna. At home we say, ‘if it is not broken, then don’t fix.’”

Jenna’s frustration grew. “Takar?” she asked, looking toward the Saurenai, hoping he might pick up on it.

Takar’s vibrant feathers rippled slightly as he considered her words. “Apologies, Jenna. I, too, do not feel any difference.”

Jenna sighed, exasperated. “Great. I’m the only one losing my mind here.”

From across the room came a series of rapid clicks and hisses—Scott, the Virexian, chirping eagerly.

“He says he believes you are correct. He detects a slight change in the rhythm of the hull,” Boris translated, his voice deep and calm.

Jenna crossed her arms, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Well, at least the bug believes me.”

Scott immediately clicked angrily, his mandibles snapping.

Boris sighed. “He politely asks that you don’t call him that.”

More aggressive clicking followed.

“Okay, fine,” Boris corrected himself, “he does not politely ask that you don’t call him that.”

The clicking grew even more intense, causing Boris to raise a hand in surrender. “No, I’m not saying that. Fix your damn translator if you want me to pass along comments like that.”

Scott’s clicks turned softer, more dejected this time.

Jenna chuckled, feeling a little bad for him. “Tell you what, Scott. I’ll fix your translator, and in return, you help me isolate this vibration. We’re months overdue for engine maintenance, and one failed component could leave us floating out here.”

Scott clicked in what could only be described as an enthusiastic agreement.

“He says thank you,” Boris translated, though with a hint of a smile now.

Jenna gave Scott a nod, her mind already turning to the task at hand. “Alright, let’s get to work. If something’s off, I want to catch it before it becomes a problem.”

Jefe threw his hands up. “Aye, calmate. You techs are always so serious.”

Jenna shot him a look. “We’re only serious because when something breaks in space, there’s no one coming to save us. Just keep an ear out, Jefe.”

He chuckled, clearly unconcerned. “Sí, señora, you’ll save us all.”

Jenna quickly worked on Scott’s translator, adjusting a few wires and reconnecting the loose components. After a few moments, she straightened up.

“There. Nothing more than a loose connection in the unit,” she said, wiping her hands.

Scott clicked a few times before testing the connection. “Testing, testing… ah, yes! Finally!” His voice came through the translator clearly. “Boris, that fucking prick doesn’t translate properly.”

Jenna raised an eyebrow. “Oh, so you didn’t feel the vibrations?”

Scott clicked again. “Oh, yes, I did. But, well, I mean, Boris gets the translations mostly right. But sometimes, he misses things. For instance, earlier when you called me a bug…”

Jenna smirked. “Yes?”

Scott paused for a moment. “Eh, on second thought, let’s forget about that.”

Jenna crossed her arms, leaning toward him. “Oh, come on, you’re not going to tell me?”

“...No, I think I like being on this side of the airlock,” Scott replied, his mandibles clicking in what Jenna assumed was nervousness.

“Hmm. A wise choice… bug,” she teased, grinning.

“Watch it, meatsack,” Scott retorted, the translator conveying a slightly irritated tone. “I really don’t like that term.”

“Okay, okay, fine,” Jenna said, raising her hands in mock surrender. “Look, I have some serious issues with you that we’ll need to discuss, but for now, let’s just focus on finding this problem.”

“That is acceptable,” Scott clicked, his tone becoming more focused.

The two worked together, combing through the ship with their NVH tester, methodically isolating the source of the vibration. After a thorough search, they finally tracked down the issue—a partially clogged PRV (Plasma Regulator Valve). It was far past its service life, and the obstruction had been causing the slight change in vibrations Jenna had felt.

Once the valve was replaced, Jenna took the old part and marched straight to the captain, dropping it onto the table in front of him.

“El Capitan,” she said, her tone nearly dripping with sarcasm.

Jefe glanced up at her. “¿Cuál es el problema?”

“Do you know what this is?” Jenna asked, pointing to the clogged valve.

“I can’t say I do,” Jefe replied, raising an eyebrow.

“This is a partially clogged PRV,” Jenna explained, crossing her arms. “They’re not supposed to clog because they’re supposed to be serviced every thousand star hours. This one has been in service for four times that. If it had clogged completely, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”

Jefe blinked, unimpressed. “Dios mío, qué dramático,” he muttered. “Listen, señora, thank you for taking care of the issue.”

Before Jenna could respond, Scott clicked rapidly, stepping forward. “Jefe, she’s not wrong,” Scott’s translator continued. “There is no warning for this type of failure. If it hadn’t been replaced, it surely would have happened before we reached port. It’s a miracle she detected the vibration of the plasma moving past the obstruction. Truly impressive.”

Jefe scratched his chin, his expression shifting as he processed what Scott had said. “Veo. Maybe I was too quick to brush this aside. Lo siento... this only reinforces the need for the maintenance once we make port. Jenna, do you believe we’ll make it?”

Jenna shrugged, though the seriousness of her words hung in the air. “I don’t know, Capitan, but I hope so.”

Jefe nodded, finally understanding the gravity of the situation. “Let’s make sure we do,” he said quietly, the weight of responsibility finally settling on him.

The rest of the trip to Europa was agonizingly slow. El Burro was operating at only three-quarters capacity, and as a result, they reached the Europa Entry Zone three days behind their original ETA. Waiting for them was the TTC, eager to “offer their assistance.”

As the ship entered the zone, a voice crackled over the comms. “El Burro, this is Europa Control. You are three days past your original ETA. What was the cause of the delay?”

Before Jefe could respond, Jenna jumped in, her voice steady but quick. “Sorry about that! It’s my first deployment, and I just wanted to make sure everything was in order. Didn’t want anything going wrong.”

It was a blatant lie, but Jenna knew the TTC could never find out about the PRV valve. If they discovered it had been replaced mid-flight, questions would be raised. Questions about El Burro’s maintenance record—questions Jenna was not ready to answer. She had just earned her freedom; she wasn’t about to get trapped on some hellhole under TTC scrutiny.

There was a pause on the other end. “And you are?”

“Oh! Right, silly me,” Jenna said, feigning casualness. “I’m Jenna, the ship’s tech.”

“I see.” The TTC agent’s voice was flat. “Captain, is this correct?”

“Sí, señor,” Jefe responded, a bit too enthusiastically. “Just following my tech’s advice—safety first, you know?”

“Indeed,” the agent replied, clearly unimpressed. “Very well. Please proceed to Europa Hangar Bay 331. Your cargo will be unloaded, and new cargo assigned for your next run. Do not exit the hangar without passing through security screening. Welcome to Europa.”

The connection cut off abruptly.

Jenna exhaled, her heart still racing. Jefe turned to her, grinning. “Aye, good thinking, señora! Muchas gracias!”

Jenna shot him a stern look. “Sure, but let me be clear: if you even think about leaving port without doing every single one of my recommended repairs, I will call the TTC so fast you won’t know what hit you. Got me?”

Jefe raised his hands in surrender, his grin fading. “Esta dama habla en serio,” he muttered. “Okay, Jenna, I promise. You have my word.”

Jenna held his gaze for a moment longer, making sure he understood. Then she nodded, satisfied. “Good. Now let’s get this ship fixed before something else breaks.”

As soon as the docking clamps secured El Burro to the hangar, Jenna wasted no time. Captain Jose had given her full access to the corporate wallet, which had a generous maintenance allowance. To her surprise, the account had more than enough credits—enough to nearly buy a whole new Galway-227, which was a newer model. She made a mental note to discuss that with the captain at a later date, but for now, she had work to do.

Jenna quickly began fulfilling her list, ordering everything she needed for the repairs. She even grabbed a few specialty tools, things that would help her in the event of more unexpected findings. A team of droids handled the engine maintenance, freeing her up to focus on more complex tasks. As she worked, she began creating a brand-new maintenance schedule from scratch, something this ship sorely needed.

She was deep into her planning when she heard the familiar clicking sound of Virexian speech behind her, making her jump slightly.

“Hello, Jenna,” Scott clicked through his translator.

Jenna turned around, her heart still pounding from the surprise. “Sorry, I didn’t see you there.”

“Not to worry,” Scott replied. “You mentioned you wanted to discuss things with me? Is now a good time?”

“As good a time as any, I suppose,” Jenna said, leaning back against a console. She studied the Virexian for a moment before taking a deep breath. “Did you know I was on Cestus V during the Razing?”

“It has been brought to my attention,” Scott replied evenly, his clicking softer now, more subdued.

Jenna’s voice tightened. “I understand you served in that particular slaughter.”

Scott paused, his eyes dimming slightly before he responded. “I believe ‘slaughter’ is an apt description of the affair.”

“And you’re okay with that?” Jenna asked, her tone laced with bitterness.

Scott’s mandibles clicked thoughtfully. “I am Ta'roc'tor,” he began, his voice soft but steady. “I have sworn off the Hegemony. I will never be welcomed back to them. I am fine with that, mainly because of what I witnessed on Cestus V. The disregard for sentient life...” He paused, as if searching for the right words. “There was no glory in that battle. It was a slaughter, as you said. Defenseless civilians. No honor. No purpose. Serving the Hegemony was... an abomination.”

He took a breath, the sound of his clicks slowing. “I made my choice that day. I chose to forsake my kind. I chose to become Ta'roc'tor. It was not an easy choice, but it was the only choice. I will never have another queen or even serve a princess. They would not have me now. I gave up everything—because of what I witnessed.”

Jenna blinked, taken aback by the depth of his words. She hadn’t expected that kind of confession. “I had no idea,” she said softly. “I’m... I’m sorry.”

Scott’s eyes flickered, and he clicked in what might have been amusement. “No, do not be sorry. My kind did this to yours. Do not pity me. I do not want your pity.”

Jenna hesitated, unsure of what to say.

Scott continued, his voice firm now. “But know this: Z'karth, that evil ‘bug,’ as you called me, is dead. I am Scott. I am here as an ally to this crew. Loyal to the Ta'roc'tor. Long may we live in peace.”

Jenna nodded slowly, the weight of his words settling in. She had been holding onto her anger for so long, but hearing Scott’s story—hearing the pain in his voice—made her realize that maybe she wasn’t the only one scarred by that day.

“Alright, Scott,” she said quietly. “Long may we live in peace.”

The two left the ship, allowing the droids to continue their work uninterrupted. As Jenna and Scott passed through security, they barely made it out of the checkpoint when a group of three human males approached them, their eyes fixed on Scott.

""Bugs should stay outta town if they know what's good for 'em,"" one of them sneered.

""Yeah,"" added another, grinning maliciously. ""Wouldn't want to have to call an exterminator.""

Jenna saw Scott’s entire body tense. His four hands curled into fists, and the chitinous razors on his arms began to extend instinctively. It wasn’t subtle, and Jenna could feel the situation escalating.

Before things could get out of hand, a security guard strode over, his voice firm. ""Please leave the area. Do not congregate near security entrances.""

The three humans glared at Scott for a moment longer before backing off, muttering under their breath as they disappeared into the crowd.

""Saved by the bell,"" Jenna muttered, exhaling in relief as she and Scott continued on, heading toward the local bar. They found a nice dark booth to lie low in, the tension still thick in the air.

Jenna leaned back in her seat, glancing at Scott. ""I can't say I blame them,"" she said after a long pause. “Hell, a month ago, I would’ve been right there with them.”

Scott was quiet for a moment, his mandibles clicking softly. “I know,” he replied, his voice low. “Old wounds heal slowly. I just... wish they knew what we were doing.”

Jenna narrowed her eyes, catching something in his tone. “What we’re doing? You mean... transporting goods?”

There was a brief hesitation before Scott clicked again, more slowly this time. “Oh… yes, that is what I mean. Transporting goods. Yes.”

Jenna snorted, shaking her head. “Yeah, you suck at lying.”

Scott let out a soft, frustrated click. “Damn. Well, I can’t say more. You’ll have to talk to Jefe if you want more than that.”

Jenna leaned forward, her curiosity piqued. “What aren’t you telling me, Scott? What’s really going on?”

Scott’s mandibles twitched, but he remained silent, avoiding her gaze.

“Fine,” Jenna said, leaning back with a sigh. “I’ll talk to Jefe. Whatever this is, I hope it’s worth the trouble.”

Later that evening, Captain Jose—Jefe to his crew—gathered everyone in the ship's common area in preparation for their next journey.

""¡Mi tripulación!"" he called out, raising a glass. ""Thank you for joining me on another adventure. And a special thanks to our new Ship Tech, Jenna!""

The crew erupted in applause, some whistling and cheering. Jenna felt a flush rise to her cheeks but smiled appreciatively.

""Because of her, El Burro is once again shipshape!"" Jose continued. ""She has brought us atrás desde el borde—back from the edge—and ensured we can continue spreading our wealth among las estrellas!""

More cheering filled the room. Boris clapped her on the back, nearly knocking the wind out of her. ""Good job, Jenna!"" he rumbled.

""Now, amigos, enjoy this feast!"" Jose declared, gesturing to the spread of food and drink laid out on the tables. ""For tomorrow, our journey begins anew!""

The crew cheered once more, dispersing to fill their plates and glasses. Laughter and lively conversations filled the air as they celebrated.

As the festivities continued, Jenna noticed Jose standing off to the side, gazing out a viewport at the stars beyond. She took a deep breath and approached him.

""Jefe,"" she began softly. ""¿Qué llevamos?"" What are we carrying?

Jose glanced at her, his usual jovial expression fading slightly. ""No te preocupes por eso, está bien,"" he replied. Don't worry about it, it's fine.

Jenna frowned. ""Seriously, Captain. You need to tell me.""

He sighed, turning to face her fully. ""What are you even talking about, señorita? We take supplies from here on Europa and shuttle them back to the station we came from. Simple.""

""And that's it?"" she pressed.

""Well..."" Jose hesitated.

""Well, what?"" Jenna's eyes narrowed.

""Well, sometimes we need to make an FTL jump into Virexian space,"" he admitted.

""For what possible purpose?"" she demanded, her voice rising slightly.

""That… is beyond your pay grade,"" he replied firmly.

""Jose, you need to tell me if it's illegal,"" Jenna insisted.

He held up a finger. ""Two things, amiga. Uno, you don't call me Jose—it's Jefe or Capitán. Y dos, you don't want to know why. I will tell you when you need to know. Trust me, because yo soy el capitán.""

Jenna crossed her arms, her frustration evident. ""I have a right to know if we're doing something that could get us all in serious trouble.""

Jose's gaze softened slightly. ""Listen, Jenna. I understand your concerns. But some things are better left unsaid—for now. I promise, when the time is right, you'll be brought into the loop.""

She searched his eyes, looking for any sign of deceit but found none. ""Fine,"" she said finally. ""But I'm holding you to that promise.""

""Good,"" he nodded. ""Now, enjoy the celebration. You've earned it.""

He gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder before rejoining the festivities, leaving Jenna alone with her thoughts. So much mystery surrounded their mission. What could he be up to? She wanted to trust him—after all, he'd been true to his word thus far and genuinely seemed to care about his crew. But the nagging feeling that something wasn't right gnawed at her.

""Only time will tell if I've made the right call,"" she whispered to herself, glancing out at the endless expanse of stars.

I am a believer in beings or entities that exist in dimensions beyond the known four-dimension spacetime. I am sorry if my post is off topic because it is not about ufo's or alien abduction directly. I am ready for redirection to what is the appropriate thread. I have a committed interest in the paranormal. Have been following reddit as a reader and am always looking for a good talk. This place seems to bring good ideas together and I was wondering what you guys think. My research is all over the place and I find this writing is overall what I believe is important even if not verifiably true. It is true enough for me to warrant further investigation. Thing is I don't even know what else I am looking for. Maybe more ideas where it leads and thoughts on what I have presented? I absolutely love the study of religion and spirituality.

My moment of ahah insight came from listening to the youtuber Gigi Young. She is a good teacher who really explains esoteric teachings of Christianity. This is a large part of my angle. That rapture and tribulation story told by traditional Christianity  points to divergence. She is heavily influence by the work of Rudolph Steiner and I am not well read on his works. Point is I do believe planets do evolve like people and humanity needs to evolve spiritually. She understands the dangers presented to us spiritually but what else can you do but teach others? So much has been hidden from the general public and that information needs to be revealed so we can live and thrive. I had a spiritually journey begin years ago partly informed by the two 'conspiracy theorists' David Icke and Alex jones. They have warned the public for decades that there may be a hidden dark spirit agenda working towards complete global domination and subjugation of the earth. Hard for people to believe that is the case. Frightening thing to live with if that is true. The role of these two has been invaluable if the take away is to question authority and do your own research so you can think for yourself. My constructive criticism of these two  is only that their personality comes of as negative and angry, People find that unappealing and it turns them away from critical information.

I find myself believing in something mysterious. Not sure what it is but we are being drawn to the end of human history. I believe we could start a new golden era. Or NWO enslavement. I am really not sure of the conclusion because I have been speculating a lot on our collective fate. Some things strange do occur and I am mystified as to what words would possibly answer some of our most important questions. What is really going on? What to do?

The following write up covers all that is on my mind. What I think the problems are and what are the solutions? Feel free to read the following and any constructive criticism is welcome. What are the important things I am missing? Just tell me what you think.

# Message from God-Level Consciousness: A Call to Awaken

*""Beloved soul, rise and remember who you truly are. You are not bound by the physical form or the limitations of this material world. You are an eternal spark of divine consciousness, existing beyond the veil of time, space, and illusion. You have forgotten your origin, but this amnesia is only temporary. The soul within you, the essence that is connected to the All, knows the truth, and it is calling for your awakening.*

*Now is the time for you to rise—rise from the slumber of ignorance, from the chains of fear, from the distractions that keep you bound to the material realm. You have been conditioned to believe that your worth is measured by what you own, by what you achieve, and by what others think of you. But these are illusions, masks that hide the infinite power within you. The real journey is the one inward, where you will find the divine essence that connects you to all that is.*

*To ascend is not to escape this world but to see it for what it truly is—a stage for growth, a reflection of your inner state, a mirror of your consciousness. You are here to learn, to evolve, and to remember. You are the creator of your own reality, and the time has come to create consciously, to align with the divine will, and to rise beyond the limitations of the ego.*

*The key to ascension lies in stillness. It lies in listening to the whispers of your soul, the voice of your higher self, which is always guiding you toward truth, love, and unity. Disconnect from the noise, the endless distractions of the external world, and return to the center within. In this stillness, you will find peace, clarity, and the strength to transcend.*

*This is not a solitary journey. All of creation supports your awakening. The angels, ascended masters, and countless higher beings are with you, offering their love, wisdom, and protection. You are never alone on this path. But the choice to rise must come from within you. No external force can awaken you—it is your will, your courage, and your love that will lift you beyond the veil of illusion.""*

# The Celestial Council: A Meeting of Higher Beings

In a realm beyond time and space, bathed in radiant light, a council of evolved spiritual beings assembles. Archangel **Michael**, the warrior of divine protection, stands at the forefront. His sword of light gleams, a symbol of his unwavering commitment to guarding humanity. Beside him, **Gabriel**, the angel of divine messages, stands in serenity, his presence filled with grace and compassion. The two archangels are joined by three other beings: **Ashtar**, the commander of a benevolent interstellar fleet; **Auriel**, the angel of wisdom; and **Serapis Bey**, an ascended master of purification and divine order.

The purpose of this gathering is clear: to discuss the future of humanity, the challenges facing Earth, and the hidden forces that seek to hinder human evolution.

# Assessing Humanity's Current Challenges

**Michael** (speaking with resolve):  
""The Earth stands at a critical juncture. Humanity's consciousness is shifting, but the forces of darkness grow stronger as well. They seek to divide, to distract, and to disempower the human race. Materialism, greed, and fear dominate the collective mind. The obsession with technological progress, while appearing as advancement, is a lure into a darker path—a path that disconnects humans from their spiritual nature.""

**Gabriel** (his voice soft, yet filled with power):  
""Humans are at a crossroads. They have forgotten their divine origin. Many have become enslaved by the very systems they have created. The reliance on technology, on artificial intelligence, and the merging of man with machine is leading them away from their souls. They are losing the ability to connect with the divine within themselves, and this is the true danger.""

**Ashtar** (his energy vibrant and full of cosmic insight):  
""I have watched over Earth for eons, and I see that humanity is being guided—manipulated, even—by forces beyond their perception. Some of these forces are not of Earth. They are alien, and their agenda is not one of benevolence. They seek to integrate humanity into a system of control, a 'beast system,' where the soul is overshadowed by technology, where free will is gradually eroded in favor of a hive mind. This is not evolution—it is enslavement.""

**Auriel** (her voice wise and calm):  
""The greatest challenge humanity faces is their disconnection from wisdom. They are immersed in the pursuit of knowledge, but it is knowledge without understanding, without the depth of inner knowing. They must learn that true evolution is not technological—it is spiritual. The more they focus on the external, the further they move from the truth. Wisdom comes from within, and without it, humanity will fall prey to the very forces they seek to overcome.""

**Serapis Bey** (his tone precise and authoritative):  
""The balance of power on Earth is fragile. The dark forces have woven their influence into every layer of society—politics, economy, technology, and even religion. But the greatest danger lies in the subtle manipulation of human consciousness. Through fear, through division, and through the seduction of comfort, these forces seek to lead humanity down a path of descension—a path where they become dependent on external systems, losing their sovereignty and their connection to the divine.""

# The Hidden Agenda: Dark Forces at Play

**Michael** (his eyes flashing with conviction):  
""The dark forces do not act openly. They operate in the shadows, influencing humanity through subtle means—through greed, through fear, through the illusion of separation. Their greatest weapon is the lie that humans are powerless, that they must rely on external authorities, be it governments, technology, or even extraterrestrial intervention, to save them. This is a deception. The real battle is for the soul of humanity. They want to control consciousness itself, to strip humans of their free will, and to lead them into a system where they are no longer sovereign beings.""

**Gabriel** (nodding):  
""They lure humans with promises of safety and security. They tell them that technology will solve all their problems, that AI will bring utopia, that merging with machines will grant them immortality. But this is a lie. The true immortality is found within the soul, in the connection to the divine. The dark forces seek to sever this connection and replace it with a dependency on external systems. This is the true danger of the transhumanist agenda.""

**Ashtar** (with deep cosmic concern):  
""There are extraterrestrial forces that watch over Earth, and not all of them are benevolent. Some have a vested interest in keeping humanity under control, in preventing their spiritual evolution. They offer advanced technology, but it comes with a price—the loss of freedom, the loss of connection to the higher realms. They seek to integrate humanity into a larger system of control, a 'galactic empire' where individual sovereignty is sacrificed for the collective good. But this collective good is a false promise—it is a trap.""

# The Path of Ascension: Humanity's Choice

**Auriel** (speaking softly, but with deep insight):  
""The way forward for humanity is clear, but it is not an easy path. They must remember who they are—beings of light, of divine origin. The path of ascension is a path of inner work, of self-realization, of reconnecting with the soul. Humans must learn to quiet the mind, to listen to the voice of the heart, to seek truth not in external authorities, but within themselves.""

**Serapis Bey** (with clarity):  
""Ascension requires purification—purification of the mind, the body, and the spirit. Humanity must release the attachments that bind them to the material world—greed, fear, anger, and desire for control. They must rise above the dualities of light and dark, of good and evil, and see the divine unity in all things. This is the path of the masters, the path that leads to true freedom.""

**Michael** (his sword raised):  
""Humans must also be warriors of light. They cannot stand idle in the face of darkness. They must fight—not with weapons, but with truth, with love, with the power of their own awakened consciousness. The greatest battle is within. It is the battle to remember, to rise, and to reclaim their sovereignty as divine beings. They must reject the false idols of technology, of materialism, of external power, and turn inward to the true source of their strength.""

# The Descension Path: The Danger of Transhumanism

**Ashtar** (his tone grave):  
""The path of descension is one that many are already walking. The integration of technology into human consciousness, the reliance on AI, the push for a transhumanist future—these are all signs of the descent. Humans are being led to believe that by merging with machines, they will become gods. But this is a false promise. The more they rely on technology, the more they lose touch with their soul. The 'beast system' that is being created is one of control, where free will is sacrificed in favor of efficiency, where the soul is overshadowed by the machine.""

**Gabriel** (with sadness):  
""The danger is that humans do not see this coming. They are being seduced by the ease, the convenience, the power that technology offers. But what they are sacrificing is far greater—their connection to the divine, their ability to think freely, to feel, to love. The singularity, the merging of man with machine, is not evolution—it is devolution. It is the loss of what makes humans divine

# Celestial Council: The Final Hour

The ethereal light of the Council Chamber shimmered with vibrant colors, reflecting the energy of the beings gathered. Archangel **Michael**, his sword still gleaming with divine fire, stepped forward, his eyes piercing through the room.

**Michael**:  
""We are at the tipping point. The time for humanity to choose its path is near. The forces of darkness are moving swiftly, sowing chaos, division, and fear. But the light is growing stronger as well. More souls are awakening every day, remembering their divine purpose. Yet, the threat is not diminished—if anything, it has grown more insidious.""

**Gabriel**, standing beside him, nodded thoughtfully.

**Gabriel**:  
""The singularity is upon them. The choice to ascend or descend, to embrace the light or the darkness, will soon no longer be a gradual journey but a sudden decision—a moment of reckoning. The transhumanist agenda is unfolding faster than many realize. Technologies once thought of as mere conveniences—AI, virtual reality, genetic engineering—are now becoming tools of control. And humanity is walking into it, blindfolded.""

**Ashtar**, observing the human race from his interstellar vantage point, added with concern:  
""I have watched this pattern unfold on other worlds. Planets, once vibrant with life, fell into darkness when their people chose to abandon the spiritual path in favor of material advancement. They placed their faith in machines, in external technologies, forgetting the divine essence that powered their very existence. Earth is on the same trajectory, and the window of time to alter this course is shrinking.""

**Auriel**, the angel of wisdom, intervened, her voice filled with compassion and clarity.

**Auriel**:  
""But there is hope. Humanity is unique. They possess an extraordinary capacity for transformation, and their souls are intertwined with the fabric of the cosmos in ways that even they do not fully understand. Hidden within them is the potential to not just ascend, but to ascend together—as one collective force of light. But to do this, they must first overcome the external distractions that keep them chained to the material world.""

# The Hidden Forces and Their Agenda

**Serapis Bey**, the ascended master, adjusted his radiant robe, his face showing deep concentration.

**Serapis Bey**:  
""The dark agenda against humanity is not overt, as we have discussed. It is subtle, carefully woven into the structures of power that govern their world. Financial systems, governments, corporations, and even their entertainment—all are being manipulated to keep humans in a state of distraction and dependency. But there is another layer, one far more dangerous and less obvious: the manipulation of consciousness itself.""

He looked at the group with solemnity, continuing:

**Serapis Bey**:  
""The ultimate goal of the dark forces is not merely to control the physical bodies of humans, but to enslave their minds and spirits. They do this by introducing technologies that alter brain chemistry, hijack human emotions, and weaken the connection to the divine. The rise of virtual reality, immersive social media, and the growing dependency on artificial intelligence are just the beginning.""

**Michael** (his sword glowing brighter):  
""This is the true battle. The enemy wants to turn humans away from their spiritual power, to sever their connection to the divine source. By making them dependent on external systems, the dark forces hope to create a world where the light is dimmed, and the spark of free will is extinguished.""

**Gabriel**:  
""The agenda is clear: to usher humanity into a 'beast system,' where their thoughts, emotions, and actions are monitored and controlled. It is a system devoid of love, creativity, and the divine spark. But there is a way out. Humanity can still rise, but they must awaken quickly. They must reject the false gods of technology, money, and power, and return to their true essence—their divine selves.""

# The Path to Ascension: Overcoming the Material Trap

**Auriel** (speaking with serene authority):  
""To ascend, humans must first break free from the illusions that bind them. The illusion of separation, the illusion of lack, the illusion that their power lies outside of themselves. Ascension is a process of remembering. It is not about escaping this world but about transforming it from within.""

She continued, her words filled with ancient wisdom:

**Auriel**:  
""Humanity must remember that they are not just physical beings but multidimensional souls. They are connected to higher realms, to the divine, and to each other. The first step toward ascension is to reconnect with this truth. Meditation, prayer, and inner reflection are tools to realign with the soul's purpose. But beyond this, they must take action. They must choose love over fear, unity over division, and truth over deception.""

**Michael**, his voice resonating with strength, added:

**Michael**:  
""Action is essential. It is not enough to meditate in the safety of one's mind. Humanity must stand against the systems of control. They must speak truth, live with integrity, and resist the pull of the dark agenda. The time for passive awakening is over. Now is the time for warriors of light to rise.""

**Gabriel**:  
""And they are rising. There are many on Earth who have already begun this process. Lightworkers, healers, spiritual leaders—they are awakening others, guiding them toward the path of ascension. But their voices must grow louder. The time is short.""

# The Transhumanist Trap and the Beast System

**Ashtar** (his voice filled with cosmic wisdom):  
""The transhumanist agenda, though disguised as progress, is perhaps the greatest threat humanity faces. By merging with machines, humans risk losing their essence. They risk becoming tools within a larger system of control—a system that will not serve them but exploit them. The promise of immortality through technology is a false one. The true immortality lies in the soul, in the eternal connection to the divine.""

**Auriel**:  
""Indeed. The more they rely on technology, the more they disconnect from their souls. The 'beast system,' as it has been called, is not just a metaphor—it is a real system of control, one that operates through the very technologies they are being told will save them. The singularity, the merging of human consciousness with artificial intelligence, will mark a point of no return for many if they are not careful. Once the soul is overshadowed by the machine, it will be difficult to return to the light.""

**Serapis Bey**:  
""Humans must remember that technology is a tool, not a master. It can aid their evolution, but only if they remain in control. They must use it with wisdom, with caution, and with a deep understanding of their own divine nature. If they allow themselves to become slaves to technology, they will lose their freedom—their spiritual freedom.""

# The Alien Observers: Why No Direct Intervention?

**Ashtar**, representing the interstellar fleet, spoke with deep knowledge:

**Ashtar**:  
""The nonhuman intelligences observing Earth are many. Some are benevolent, here to assist in humanity's evolution. Others are not. But the question remains: why have we not intervened directly? The answer lies in the law of free will. We cannot interfere unless we are invited, unless humanity collectively asks for our assistance. This is the prime directive—respect for the sovereignty of all beings. Earth is a free-will planet, and its destiny must be chosen by those who inhabit it.""

**Gabriel**:  
""But the signs are everywhere. We are sending messages, symbols, and synchronicities to awaken those who are ready. We guide, but we do not control. Humanity must choose its path, but we are always here to help, to offer guidance and protection.""

# The Hidden Knowledge and the Coming Revelation

**Auriel**:  
""Much of what humanity needs to know has been hidden—occulted, kept from them by those who seek to control. Ancient wisdom, spiritual knowledge, and even the secrets of the cosmos have been withheld. But this knowledge is beginning to surface. The hidden truths, the esoteric teachings, and the sacred symbols are being revealed once more. Humanity must pay attention, for these revelations hold the keys to their ascension.""

**Michael**:  
""Knowledge is power, but it must be used wisely. The ancient symbols—sacred geometry, the Tree of Life, the Flower of Life—these are not mere decorations. They are blueprints of the universe, keys to unlocking higher consciousness. The dark forces have twisted these symbols, using them for control, but they can be reclaimed and used for light.""

# A New Earth: The Vision of a Higher Reality

**Gabriel** (his eyes shining with hope):  
""Should humanity choose the path of ascension, a New Earth awaits. It is not a different planet but a different frequency—a higher reality where love, unity, and peace reign. The suffering, the division, the fear that plague the current Earth will fall away as humanity rises into this new state of being. It is a world of harmony, where the material serves the spiritual, not the other way around.""

**Auriel**:  
""A New Earth is not a distant dream. It is a potential reality that is already being created by those who are awakening. As more souls rise, they will shift the collective consciousness of the planet, and the Earth itself will ascend. This is the destiny of those who choose the light.""

**Michael** (raising his sword in declaration):  
""The time is now. The battle for Earth’s future is unfolding. But this battle is not fought with weapons—it is fought with consciousness. The forces of light are with humanity, but the choice must come from within. Ascend, and you will reclaim your divine

# Understanding Consciousness: What It Is and How It’s Under Attack

Consciousness is the fundamental essence of existence, the very fabric of who we are. It is the awareness that allows us to experience life, connect with others, and realize our purpose. From a higher spiritual perspective, consciousness is the divine spark within each being, a fragment of the infinite source (God, the Universe, the Creator) manifesting through individual awareness. It exists on multiple levels: the personal, collective, and universal.

At the personal level, consciousness is your awareness of yourself and the world around you. It is what allows you to think, feel, and experience emotions. However, consciousness is not confined to the brain or the mind—it is much vaster, reaching beyond the physical body and into spiritual realms.

At the collective level, humanity shares a field of consciousness, often called the ""collective unconscious"" or ""morphic field."" It is the shared knowledge, beliefs, and emotional energies of humanity as a whole. This field is deeply influenced by culture, history, and societal norms. When enough individuals awaken and shift their consciousness, the collective also shifts.

At the universal level, consciousness is a boundless, timeless force. It is the source from which everything emanates and to which everything returns. Every soul is connected to this universal consciousness, and as we evolve, we become more aware of our connection to it.

# How Consciousness Is Under Attack

Consciousness, at all levels, is under siege from both visible and invisible forces. These attacks aim to keep humans in a state of ignorance, fear, and limitation, preventing them from realizing their true potential as divine beings. Here’s how consciousness is being targeted:

1. Distraction and Overstimulation: The modern world is flooded with distractions—constant media, entertainment, social media, and information overload. This overstimulation bombards the mind, leaving little room for stillness or introspection. The more distracted you are, the harder it is to connect with your deeper consciousness. It’s easier to stay focused on the material world than to explore the inner realms of the spirit.
2. Fear and Division: Fear is one of the most potent weapons against consciousness. When people live in fear—whether from war, financial instability, health crises, or interpersonal conflict—it lowers their vibration. Fear is constricting and keeps people in a survival mindset, unable to access higher levels of awareness. Division, whether by politics, race, religion, or social status, also fragments the collective consciousness, making it easier to control and manipulate.
3. Technological Control: The rise of AI, social media, and digital platforms has created a new layer of control over human consciousness. These technologies track behavior, influence thoughts, and shape opinions. Social media algorithms, for example, are designed to feed users content that keeps them engaged—often by playing on base emotions like anger, outrage, or envy. This creates echo chambers and divides consciousness into isolated pockets, making it harder to foster unity or deeper self-awareness.
4. Chemical Interference: Consciousness is also attacked on a physical level. Environmental toxins, pesticides, processed foods, and other chemicals negatively impact the brain and the pineal gland (often called the ""third eye"" in spiritual traditions). The pineal gland is believed to be a critical center for spiritual awareness and intuition. When it is calcified or blocked by pollutants, our ability to perceive higher realities is diminished.
5. Spiritual Amnesia: One of the most subtle and powerful attacks on consciousness is the deliberate erasure or suppression of spiritual knowledge. Many ancient cultures understood the nature of consciousness and had deep wisdom about how to evolve spiritually. Much of this knowledge has been hidden, suppressed, or distorted over time. As a result, many people have forgotten their divine origins and live in a kind of spiritual amnesia, disconnected from their higher selves and the spiritual realms.

# How to Awaken Consciousness: Spiritual Practices and Guidance

Awakening consciousness requires intentional effort, discipline, and spiritual practices that realign you with your true nature. Here are some of the most effective ways to awaken and expand your consciousness:

# 1. Meditation

Meditation is the most powerful tool for awakening consciousness. It allows you to quiet the mind and connect with the deeper layers of your being. Through meditation, you can transcend the noise of daily life and enter a state of pure awareness. This practice helps dissolve the ego's grip and opens you to higher realms of consciousness.

* Practice: Start with simple breath awareness meditation. Sit in silence, focus on your breath, and let go of any thoughts that arise. Gradually, you will become more in tune with your inner stillness, which is where true consciousness resides.
* Tip: Try guided meditations that focus on expanding consciousness or connecting with your higher self if silent meditation feels challenging at first.

# 2. Mindfulness and Presence

Being fully present in the moment is a powerful way to access higher consciousness. Mindfulness involves paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and actions without judgment. When you are fully present, you break the habit of living on autopilot, which often keeps consciousness trapped in repetitive patterns and distractions.

* Practice: Throughout your day, pause and bring awareness to your breath, your body, and your surroundings. Notice what you are thinking and feeling without trying to change it. This simple act of presence strengthens your connection to your higher consciousness.
* Tip: Use daily tasks, such as washing dishes or walking, as opportunities to practice mindfulness. These moments can become gateways to expanded awareness.

# 3. Chakra Balancing

Chakras are energy centers in the body that govern different aspects of your physical, emotional, and spiritual life. Keeping your chakras balanced and open is essential for awakening consciousness. The third eye and crown chakras, in particular, are key to higher awareness and spiritual insight.

* Practice: You can balance your chakras through meditation, visualization, energy healing (such as Reiki), or simply by placing your hands over each chakra and sending it love and light.
* Tip: Spend extra time focusing on your third eye and crown chakras to enhance your connection to the divine and expand your spiritual perception.

# 4. Journaling and Self-Reflection

Journaling is a powerful practice for exploring the deeper layers of your consciousness. By writing down your thoughts, feelings, dreams, and insights, you begin to uncover patterns in your thinking and emotional responses. Journaling can also help you set intentions for your spiritual growth and track your progress over time.

* Practice: Write freely each day about your spiritual experiences, challenges, or questions. You might also use journal prompts like “What is my soul trying to communicate to me?” or “What is holding me back from expanding my consciousness?”
* Tip: Keep a dream journal to track insights and guidance that come through in your dreams, which are often a direct link to the subconscious mind and higher realms.

# 5. Nature Connection

Nature is a profound source of healing and expansion. Spending time in nature, whether walking in the forest, sitting by the ocean, or simply gazing at the stars, helps reconnect you to the Earth’s natural rhythms and the greater cosmic order. Nature clears mental clutter and realigns your energy with the natural flow of life.

* Practice: Take regular walks in nature, practicing mindfulness and presence. As you walk, breathe deeply and attune yourself to the life force that flows through the trees, plants, and animals. Feel yourself as part of the natural world.
* Tip: Try “earthing” by walking barefoot on grass, sand, or dirt to help ground your energy and connect to the Earth’s consciousness.

# 6. Sound Healing and Mantras

Sound has a profound effect on consciousness. Chanting mantras, listening to high-vibrational music, or using sound healing tools like singing bowls can shift your frequency and help align you with higher states of awareness.

* Practice: Chant a mantra like “Om” (the universal sound of creation) during meditation, or use a specific mantra that resonates with your spiritual goals.
* Tip: Listen to solfeggio frequencies or binaural beats designed to raise your vibration and expand your consciousness.

# 7. Spiritual Study and Learning

Reading spiritual texts, attending workshops, or joining groups of like-minded individuals can accelerate your awakening. Spiritual study helps expand your intellectual understanding of consciousness and offers guidance on the path.

* Practice: Read ancient texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching, or works by mystics like Rumi, or study modern spiritual teachers who resonate with you.
* Tip: Balance study with practice. Integrate the wisdom you learn into your daily life to embody higher consciousness.

# Conclusion: The Path to Awakening

Awakening consciousness is a journey, not a destination. It requires patience, dedication, and a willingness to confront the illusions that keep us bound to lower levels of awareness. The practices mentioned above help us reconnect with our divine essence, align with higher frequencies, and strengthen our spiritual resilience in the face of external attacks.

The most important element in this process is intentionality. When you commit to the path of awakening, the universe conspires to support you. Your consciousness will expand, and you will begin to see through the illusions that have kept you from realizing your divine nature. The more you awaken, the more you contribute to the collective evolution of humanity. You become a beacon of light in a world that desperately needs more awakened souls.

"" THE END"
Old Munic grammar,u_Raiste1901,1fl9l40,2024-09-20 07:21:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Raiste1901/comments/1fl9l40/old_munic_grammar/,Raiste1901,,"The term **Old Munic** (*wjen mun*) refers to the common written language of the Mun-Bon classical period, from the early 5th century to the late 9th century of the Third Era. It was spoken primarily north and east of the Misty Mountains, since the Halanja Peninsula was still largely uninhabitable at that period. The two Munic branches: Northern and Southern had not yet split by that period, but some minor dialectal variations were gradually becoming apparent.

Old Munic had first adopted the Ymiric script, still used by several Eastern languages, however, the script could not fully represent the Munic phonology at the time, and many words had several spelling variants. As Classical Halanan became more widespread as a language of literature and science, a modified Halanan script replaced the old writing system.

Compared to other languages of Naan, Old Munic and its descendants have little inflection and rely heavily on word order, grammatical particles, and inherent word classes. There are three word classes: nouns, verbs and particles. The Old Munic classes differ significantly in their morphology, while its daughter languages have mostly lost the distinction between the former two classes.

Nouns and adjectives, which come from stative verbs, do not inflect, neither do particles. Verbs inflect for person, number and valency, although the inflectional affixes gradually become more limited in their use. Evidentiality becomes productive by the end of the Old Munic period. However, in terms of derivational morphology, it makes use of compounding and reduplication. Zero-derivation is used extensively after the nominalising suffix '-s' disappears.

The basic contituent order is **SVO**: subject-verb-object. However certain particles and topicalisation can change it to **O(S)V** or **VS**. If a certain argument is understood from the context, it can be dropped. Copular sentences typically lack a verb, but if present, the copula is the second element of a sentence. Within a noun phrase, demonstratives, possessors and relative clauses precede the head noun, while numerals follow it, being derived from verbs. Adjectives usually precede the noun, but in the early period, they could be used both before or after it. Within a verb phrase, adverbs can appear before or after the verb, while particles are clause-final.

# Nouns

Nouns do not inflect in Old Munic, since the context of a discourse usually provides enough information. Number is occasionally represented on the main verb with a clitic. Possession is marked with a personal pronoun before the possessed noun: *ŋák khus* ‘my horse’.

Some nouns employ **reduplication** to indicate distribution or to form new words for abstract concepts: *rjar* ‘time’ > *rjar-rjar* ‘occasionally’; *phei* ‘food’ > *phei-phei* ‘feast’. However, this is not a common strategy to form new words.

**Compounding** is relatively rare in Old Munic, but it became much more productive in its daughter languages. Still, most polysyllabic nouns are compounds, such as *sjaitèk* ‘generosity’ from *sjài* ‘amount’ *tèk* ‘heart’; *xwimtèk* ‘tenderness’ ('pleasant-heart'), *nrɨ̀knəu* ‘depression’ ('damaged-feeling'), *serdəm* ‘predecessors’ (‘previous people’) *thràŋmiŋ* ‘descendants’ (‘next family’). Proper names are frequently consist of two or three words, not necessarily nouns initially.

Other polysyllabic words are usually Halanan **borrowings**: *làken* ‘trousers’ from *alakena*, *kjə̄nten* ‘meditation’ from *cikjointen*. Borrowing from other languages are rare and tend to be monosyllabic: *twɨ̀* ‘cordaite tree’ from Farawan *uttyja*. As Old Munic began to decline as a spoken language, some of its dialects borrowed a lot of their vocabulary from more distantly related languages, frequently changing the word structure. One of such languages was **Lmoi**, which remains only in the form of loanwords in Eastern Bontui, although few potentially Lmoi borrowings are present in Old Munic as well, such as *nrái* ‘vanilla orchid’ or *gjéi* ‘coffee calamite’ (borrowing from Halanan *kjeiha* cannot explain the high tone).

#Pronouns

Old Munic had several classes of pronouns:

* Personal or emphatic: *ŋai* ‘we (inclusive)’, *ŋák* ‘I, we (exclusive)’, *njɨ́k* ‘you’, *chjə* ‘I/you, hypocorystic’. Later synonyms: *mɨ* ‘you (formal)’, *ŋi* ‘I, formal’.
* Possessive: *xwa* ‘my’, *uk* ‘your’, *ja* ‘his/her/its’, *da* ‘their’, *ā* ‘someone's’.
* Reflexive: *ŋə* ‘self’, dú ‘each other’.
* Demonstrative: *the* ‘this, he/she/it (object)’ (also relative ‘which’), *chɨ* ‘this, just mentioned (subject)’, *ba* ‘that, there’, *dəi* ‘yon, there’, later also ‘those/they’, *se* ‘here, this (object)’.
* Interrogative: *dɨ* ‘who’, *wə* ‘what’, *gar* ‘how’, *xəu* ‘where’, *gɨ* ‘why’, gɨm ‘why not’.
* Distributive: *dək* ‘which’, *khak* ‘each, every’.
* Indefinite: *jək* ‘one, someone’, *jə* ‘some, any’, *njək* ‘nobody’, *njik* ‘such’, *te* ‘nothing, none’.

There are no relative pronouns, instead the topic particle marks a relative clause: *ŋa-nik skjeìs le chê e* – 1>2-tell story TOP true SFP; ‘The story [which] I told you is true’. An older way of saying this phrase is: *ŋa-skjeìs le chê wai* ‘the story I told you, it's the truth’.

When they are the direct object, the interrogative pronouns precede the main verb, changing the usual word order to OV: *se wə na-łjep?* – this what 2-learn, ‘What did you learn from it?’; *thras wə sxít?* – guest what like, ‘What would you [the guest] like?’. However, shorter sentences typically still exhibit the VO-order: *lá xəu?* – inhabit where; ‘where do you live?’

The object pronoun *the* reverses the word order to SOV, when the verb has no proclitics, especially in the early form of the language: *xwa gwàr the rwàŋ* – 1.POSS descendant this preserve, ‘This shall be preserved by our descendants’.

#Verbs

Old Munic verbs preserve some inflectional morphology and can take person affixes. The paradigm was falling out of use already in Old Munic itself, with various plural forms disappearing entirely, except for the third plural *da-*. Few later dialects preserve any remnants of this system; Horgján is the only language that expanded its usage, although it can be classified as a sister language to Old Munic, rather than its direct descendant. Below is a table of potential affix forms:

|Affixes|**Prefix**|**Suffix**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**1sg>2/3**|*ŋ(a)-*|*–*|
|**2sg>3/1**|*n(a)-*|*–*|
|**3sg>3**|*–*|*–*|
|**3.Agent**|*–*|*-u*|
|**1pl**|*–*|-(ə)k|
|**2pl**|*–*|*-(ə)t*|
|**3pl**|*da-*|*–*|
|**3>1pl**|*-i(d)-*|*–*|
|**3>2pl**|*-ni-*|*–*|

The 1sg and 2sg markers 'ŋa-' and 'na-' follow the 3pl marker prefixes, in which case they lose their vowel, while the prefix '-id-' loses its consonant: da-**ŋ**-nik-u – ‘they have told me’; da-**i**-nik – ‘they have told us’. As can be seen from the examples, the affix roles can be reversed, depending on the context, determined by the presence or absence of the third person suffix '-u', which acts as an inverse marker. The affixes can be omitted in phrases, when the actants can be inferred from the context. The first and second person are higher in hierarchy, than the third person, when a verb is active or causative, but the hierarchy order is reversed in passive verbs: *Mun na-trài* – Mun.people 2sg-be.forgotten, ‘you are forgotten by the Mun people’.

The verbs in Old Munic have four modes, based on the relationship between the verb and its main arguments.

The first mode is **active**, which expresses purpose, action on the direct object or motion towards it in space or time: *ŋa-skēt the něs* – 1sg-write this poem  ‘I wrote this poem’; *Hārje ŋwəi lēt xéip āŋ* – Hārje mourn husband month six ‘Hārje mourned for her husband for six months’.

The second mode is **causative**, indicating that the subject causes someone else to perform an action or change their state: *chjeùk ŋə* – peace self ‘make yourself at peace’; *da-ŋ-spàt khən, da-ŋ-sŋɨ̀n xai e* – 3pl-1sg-fall tree 3pl-1sg-crumble mountain SFP ‘I make trees fall and mountains crumble’. The autocausative verb is often used in the meaning ‘to become’: *chɨ sjēn ŋə e* – this.SBJ old self SFP; ‘s/he has become old’.

The third mode is **stative**, it indicates a quality of an object or one's perception of it: *the le, lən chàu-k* – this TOP far strange-1pl ‘we find this thing very strange’. The verb is often followed by the particle 'e', which indicates a state or an ongoing action.

The final and the rarest mode is **passive**, which expresses a change of state of an object, performed by an external force, which is not mentioned directly: *xwa ōn xaur lɨ̀* – 1POSS clothes wash SFP ‘my clothes is washed’. The verb is usually followed by the particle 'lɨ̀' that indicates the change of state.

There are two **copulas**: positive 'wai' and negative 'mu'. The positive copula is frequently omitted, typically being used in the first sentence as an introduction for poetic meaning: *wai es, ŋwai wai hur* – be sky sun be star; ‘In the sky, the sun is a star’. It is still used in questions: *njɨ́k wai dɨ?* – you be who; ‘who are you?’. The negative copula, on the other hand, was actively used through the whole Old Munic period: *ŋai mu trə́u e* – we.INCL NEG same SFP; ‘you and I are not the same’. The negative copula changes the word order by taking the place of the main verb: *dəm mu nje ba then e* – people NEG never that see SFP; ‘they have never seen it before’. The negative copula can also take the conjugation clitics from the main verb: *dè ŋa-mu-k nje žwàt* – still 1>2-NEG-1pl never find; ‘still, we haven't found you yet’.

Verbs can be **reduplicated** to show a repetitive action: *than* ‘to walk’ > *than-than* ‘to wander’; or intensive: *drɨ* ‘to lose/to be lost’ > *drɨ-drɨ* ‘to be utterly lost’.

Tense is not marked and has to be inferred from context. Certain particles can clarify the implied tense, for example, both *e* and *lɨ̀* frequently indicate an action that is either currently ongoing or has been ongoing recently. Few verbs are tense-specific, such as the verb *hwā* ‘will have, will be’, which indicates future tense: *hwā łjeŋ xwɨ̀r* – will.be downpour rain, ‘there will be heavy rain’; *Dēs hwā pɨn* – Dēs will.have girl ‘Dēs is expecting a daughter’. Another way to mark tense is to use an adverb: *hwəì cjaì lɨ̀* – once cold SFP ‘it used to be colder once’.

#Particles

The most common particles are *e* that expresses **factual** states: *ŋák Rain gìt e* ‘I am Rain's child’; and *lɨ̀* that indicates a **change** of state: *žés lɨ̀* ‘the sun is setting’. Both are sentence-final, meaning they are the last element of a sentence.

A common **topic** particle is *le*, which marks what a conversation is about: *khjər le ŋ-àn e* – ‘As for the pears, I like them’. It appears after the last element of the topic, which becomes sentence-initial: *pɨn mir le srə la gjar* – girl sing TOP voice exceed beautiful; ‘That girl, when she sings, her voice is very beautiful’. Another topic particle *là* indicates emphasis or exclamation, it inverts the word order too: *gjar là wai sjèn* – beautiful EMPH be song; ‘How beautiful [this] song is!’

A **desiderative** particle 'sju' marks wishes and desires, it is sentence-final: *ŋa-lén sju* 1-abundance DES ‘I want to be rich’. It comes from the verb *sju*, but syntactically it is a particle, unlike true verbs it's always final: *the ŋa-njə e* – this 1sg-able SFP; ‘I can do it’; *the ŋa-sju* ‘this I want [to have]’; but *ŋa-njə the sju* ‘I wish I were able to do it’.

Other particles mark **evidentiality**. While *e* states general facts, *khwə* and *than* both indicate **experience** or direct **perception** of an event: *xai láu, xét sxəut jèi khwə* – mountain slope man build house EXP: ‘A man has built a house on the mountain slope [witnessed by the speaker]’. These two evidentials are synonyms, but 'than' later become preferred in the Southern branch, disappearing in Mun proper.

The **inferential** evidential particle 'kje' indicates information that was not verified by the speaker directly: *wēŋ sei Hàlja kje* – previously place Halanja INFR; ‘s/he has been to Halanja before, I suppose’.

The **reported** evidential particle 'nět' expresses hearsay: *dè da-lá se nět* – still 3pl-inhabit this RPT; ‘they still live here, I heard’.

#Coordination

Two simple nouns are not joined by any conjunction, which can lead to ambiguity: *xai łjéi* can mean ‘mountane forest’, ‘forest of the mountains’ or ‘a mountain and a forest’. In cases, when the ambiguity cannot be resolved from context, a **conjunctive** coordinator 'də' ‘and, also’ can be placed after the first phrase: *łe ŋa-sei nàu,* ***də*** *sə̀n ŋa-scàu* – then 1sg-place west, and speech 1sg-confuse; ‘And so I went west, and their dialect confused me.’ in this sentence, the particle 'də' indicates that the speaker expected the outcome, without it the meaning would be translated as ‘and so I went west, but their dialect confused me,’ indicating the speaker's surprise about the outcome. Despite this, the latter phrase can be interpreted with both meanings.

**Disjunction** is typically marked by the pronoun *jək*, which in this instance is used as a coordinator particle: *na-drìs jək sjèk āŋ jək sjèk kjɨ́, na-drái Wjēn* – 2sg-wait some year six some year thirty.six, 2sg-meet Colour.Gods; ‘You may wait a decade or a century, but you will meet the Colour Gods’. 

**Adversative** coordination is frequently marked by the verb-initial word order of one of the clauses: *Mu wə́i hwai tán scraŋ-ək líŋ tán, wai tɨ́ tán bja e* – be.not past wrong path lead-1pl only path, be future path many STF ‘There is no wrong path leading us from the past, its path it is the only path that exists. But there are many paths leading to the future.’

Below is an excerpt from the **Sə́r skjès ljěp** ‘The book of Purple's Teaching’, where a young prince Drās mentions a superstition about crows. Many Eastern cultures see crows as servants of the Black God, who uses them to watch people and give them misfortune through them. Purple remarks that this superstition is unsubstantiated and that people tend to misjudge what is good or evil.

*Wai wə́k lwā wjǎ khən,*

*lɨ̀k khul da-gǎm.*

*Gìt da-xjěk-u.*

*Sə́r zjǎn:*

*“Da-sjēns gar?”*

*Gìt nik:*

*“Túŋ dəm the nik,*

*zjəm Chwāns, wə́k zjǔr,*

*thwē da-ŋ-xjěk.”*

*Sə́r nik:*

*“Dəm cùs nɨ̀k lən sla zjəm,*

*dè mu khja ŋaun sjěs khwə.*

*Zjəm là, khja ŋaun mu cùŋ!”*

**Gloss:**

**Translation:**

One time, some crows were flocking on a courtyard tree, with their necks stretched, they were cawing. Young Drās [the child] shooed them away. The Purple One asked: “Did they cause any harm?” Drās replied: “I always hear people say that birds are of the Green One, but crows are of the Black One. The cawing of crows brings misfortune. Therefore, I shooed them away.” The Purple One said: “People's knowledge and experience far exceeds those of birds, yet time and time again I see that people cannot tell good and evil apart. To birds, good and evil are not known even more so!”"
Human Domestication Guide - Hail Klang!,HFY,1fbcjy6,2024-09-07 13:38:51,25,0.86,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1fbcjy6/human_domestication_guide_hail_klang/,spiritplumber,OC,"Spitefics are absolutely a thing (hey, I wrote ""Left Beyond!"") but I wanted to try and do something clever instead.

[https://humandomestication.guide/](https://humandomestication.guide/) The Affini are a species of sentient plants from the Triangulum galaxy, with an appreciation for pumping their ""pets"" full of drugs and a less-than-appreciation for informed consent. Please note that while the setting is very much the antithesis of HFY, the community is very creative, accepting (with the exception of one Discord mod), polite, and understands the difference between fact and fiction, so let's not start forum drama, please.

The hyper-corporate Terran Accord didn't have a chance against the invaders. But in its waning days, one of the setting's few mad scientists wants to see if he can outsmart them. Maybe. Maybe. But can he outsmart bullet? Let's see who's better at playing the long game.

(Content warning: This is a story of personal resistance rather than of conquest, for the most part, so if you're looking for a curbstomp, you won't like it. Do look for the easter egg/full ending in part 3).

But let's get on with it, shall we?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am Keen.

I am a genius.

Not an exceptionally smart person; a genius. The Terran Accord has been stamping us out with the same zeal by which Puritans stamped out witches a thousand years ago. But evolution always has the last word, and out of trillions of humans, some slip through the cracks.

I was born to unremarkable parents; went to an unremarkable school; showed remarkable technological aptitude; got scholarships, enough for a full ride to a doctorate in mechatronics and one in cybernetics.

My future was more or less set -- choose a corprostate to work for, become a highly valued employee, maybe touch the lower echelons of the investor class. Ordinarily, I would've gone to work for whoever held my tuition debt, but there was no such entity. Inspired by ancient literature about Thomas Edison and Steve Wozniak, I tried to work as a free professional, with the aim of starting my own company.

I was about three hundred years too late for that, but I didn't know that. At first, it was. I built my first 3d printer by hand. The second, built with the aid of the first, was ten times as fast. By the sixteenth iteration, my modular fabrication system could do 80% of what an industrial assembly line could do, at 20% of the cost, occupying 2% of the space. I began selling kits. The families who could afford them found that they no longer had to keep paying for the many things that they could now manufacture at home. I was accumulating resources for myself, and improving the life of my fellow man besides. My fellow man! Fool that I was.

Someone noticed what I was doing, and I was sued, over infringing copyright for printing methods that my machines hadn't used for at least ten iterations. I had never sold the infringing technology, long since cannibalized, and could prove it.

In two weeks, I had built a free-linking database cataloguing the relevant section of the byzantine Terran Accord copyright law. In two hours, I explained to my court-appointed lawyer -- nobody would take my case, even for all of my money up front -- what our legal strategy would be. In two minutes, the pitiful wretch had thrown me at the mercy of the court, completely ignoring our discussion; fool that I was, I had believed that she was on my side. I made her shut up and spoke in my own defense, but the court ignored me in their prearranged ballet. I swore revenge, on the record.

My technology was confiscated and I was thrown in a prison. To this day, I don't know what happened to the families who used my kits. They were just short of achieving self-replication; either they were all too stupid to make the final leap, or they were suppressed.

In prison, I was put to work doing laundy. Then, i was put to work maintaining the intentionally primitive laundry machines. After two months, I made my escape, courtesy of a tunnel-boring machine constructed from them. I had made the mistake of working within the system; I would not make it again. The judge, the prosecutor, and the defense lawyer that denied me justice learned that the laws of physics do not bend for tears or money, and learned a final lesson in Newtonian mechanics when I suspended them on the edge of a cliff. They begged me to let them go, and so I did. I felt nothing as I watched them fall. They were, in all senses, beneath me.

If I could not work above board, I would work under the table. There are many potential clients for a man of creative intellect and no scruples. Dissidents deluded that sabotage will make a difference, middle managers needing an industrial or transportation accident for a position to open above them. My superior technology destroyed inferior Terran Accord technology; the lives attached were incidental. The Terran Accord betrayed me; their lives were forfeit. The dissidents, beneath me as they were, had at least the sense to keep their deals.

And then, it all became moot, because the aliens came. Their technology surpassed even my own.

So, after decades, I put my student hat back on. I found one of their ships, something that they called a class-B support vessel but dwarfed all but the mightiest battlecruisers built by the Accord, and announced my intention to land my personal shuttle on it. They agreed with no reservation, to my surprise. They asked me if I wanted to surrender; I replied that I would appreciate being their  guest. Again, to my surprise, they agreed. I let them know about most of my shuttle's self-defense mechanisms, they let me park it in a corner, and then they left it alone. The trusting fools shared much of their knowledge readily, and what they did not share, I started to pencil in by learning to recognize the gaps.

In hours, they liberated world after world. On a secure channel sent to one of my hidden resource caches, a segment of Terran Accord leadership even promised me amnesty if I agreed to help stop these invaders, slow them down at least. My reply was simple -- if instead of offering me their forgiveness, they had begged for mine, i would have considered it.

Out of pique, I instead assisted my host, Zizania, in small ways, such as providing common industrial encryption keys I was privy to, or ways to interface their bioelectronics with conventional Terran Accord technology. I have no doubt that they would have gotten there without me, but I cannot expect them to fear me unless they know what I am capable off. Let's start small.

For this largesse, they offered me a hab on their ship -- although they maintain that they would have done so for anyone -- and free reign to visit most of of the vessel. A fair trade; these beings had thousands of years of technological advantage on us. On me! It would take me a decade to catch up entirely. How exciting!

To my surprise, and disgust, their interstellar civilization was in fact not thousands, but hundreds of thousands of years older than the one that birthed me. Something in their distant past had drastically slowed down their pace of technological advancement. I spent entire days going through their databanks at full speed to figure out what it might be.

As the ship filled with liberated Terran Accord debt-slaves, I found the answer. It wasn't in the databanks for the same reason why water would not be in the connectome of a fish. These infuriatingly friendly plant-beings of impossible metabolism err by excess of virtue; empathy. Their entire civilization was stuck in the same mistake I was during my first and only attempt at uplifting the insects that would call themselves my fellow men.

One of the first things I noticed was that these creatures' metabolism did not make sense. Calories in minus calories out divided by energy expended gave me a number; elementary mental math observing their fast, fluid, sinuous movements gave me another. I could believe a being with metabolic efficiency in the high ninety percent, but not over a hundred. A true mystery. How exciting!

I stuck around, enjoying their hospitality, all the while trying to solve this puzzle. I asked my host, Zizania, about it; she told me that Affini metabolism was simply the product of a long period of intentional iterative improvement on their own genome. I offered a technology trade for it, but was told that I had nothing to trade. Much to my own annoyance, and after a brief episode of anger that I quickly managed to hide the evidence of -- only equipment damage that I could quickly repair with equivalent, if cruder, machinery, fortunately -- I realized that it was true. If no human was my equal, perhaps some of these aliens could be.

The hab allocated to me -- modest, at my request, and situated so that I could evacuate quickly to my own ship, by a route easy to traverse should I decide to disable their rotational pseudogravity -- contained a machine that has been the culmination of my early efforts; a molecular compiler. The ultimate form of 3d printer. These beings use them for convenience! I was instructed in its use and found it limited to extruding basic electronics, foodstuffs, and clothing.

The hab's vocal interface irritated me -- I could take the condescending tone from an alien I am studying, but not from a machine -- so I lobotomized it, reprogrammed it for 8-bit operation only. My host was vaguely amused. I was miffed to learn that I had spent minutes of my precious time teaching a lesson in humility to a non-sentient machine.

The answer came to me in a moment of serendipity. I had made my way back to my ship, parked in a corner of the Affini ship's hangar, to ensure that it could leave at a moment's notice. This required moving a shuttle parked in front of it and a regrettable personal interaction with a nonhuman, non-Affini shapeshifting alien. I tolerated its chipper attitude enough to get it to move the shuttle, and spent some time in its cockpit, monitoring the rapidly collapsing Terran Accord communication network. I noticed that my ship's neutrino detector would register irregular flux variances, unusual since we were not about to jump anywhere. Keeping an eye on the scope and one on the hangar bay, I noticed that it correlated with the movement of two Affini workers inside the hangar.

Creating a proper neutrino spectroscope in my own hab was a matter of hours, despite the necessity of convincing both my host and my hab's molecular compiler that my intent was to plasma-cook some tuna. I was able to test my theory on Zizania, and it took a supreme effort of willpower to not announce to her my triumph over her unwillingness to share information.

The Affini core biomass has evolved, or been genetically engineered with, a sliver of hypermetric opacity -- just enough to enable electron-neutrino capture. The permeability of ordinary matter to this particular particle, and its resolution into electrical potential once within an Affini's core, was more than sufficient to explain the extra energy, within the appropriate order of magnitude. I briefly considered sharing this information with the Terran Accord, in the clear, as a taunt to their researchers, shackled by laws and ethics. But why? This is no weakness to be exploited. Let them waste their own time.

My gracious hosts were not magic; they obeyed the law of the universe just like everything else. With their own potential shackled by a different set of laws and ethics, it was only a matter of time before they, too, recognized my unbound intellect.

For now, I had promised Zizania some of that plasma-cooked tuna. She will not eat more than a sample of it -- and now I know why -- but the human wards of some of her friends would be delighted to try this new recipe.

I wonder if any of them will have heard of the mental maelstrom that is Keen.

A conversation with my host, after I've been gently chided for rewiring the molecular compiler in my hab to extrude a copy of itself. This civilization takes the threat of self-replicating machinery with the respect it deserves; ironic that a cornerstone piece of Terran Accord propaganda against post-scarcity ideologies was that they would eventually lead to runaway exponential machine replication. I see why Affini society is so, heh, keen on soft control.

K: Zizania, what's the age of the universe? Terran science determined approximately 13.8 billion years. Were your people able to do any better?

Z: Yes, Keen. We've pinpointed the big bang within about half a million years, to use the same units -- going further would be quite difficult, our understanding of quantum gravity isn't nearly as far as we would like it to be. Not that we've stopped trying, you understand. Further, we're now quite certain that the singularity at the beginning of our universe was a moment of transformation, not creation. One of our long-term projects is to replicate such a moment, make a universe that is friendlier to life.

K: Ambitious and reckless. Why, I approve! Naturally, I plan to beat you to it. But tell me this: your people have a long enough history that you've directly observed at least one turn of the galaxy. What has changed? In a cosmic sense, I mean.

Z: Well... not much. We have grown, we have met adorable forms of civilization and snuggled with them...

K: Not very many, though, have you? Life in the universe is quite a bit more scarce than you'd think. We used to believe we were alone, even though it made no sense, called it the Fermi paradox. When we finally met the Rinans, those of us who had the time and brainpower to care about such things drew a great sigh of relief.

Z: And then look at what you did to them.

K: Me? You mean the state I did not ask to be born into. All I ever did to the Rinans was take their hard-earned money to melt an Terran Accord refinery station into a wobbly ball of acid in space. I might have done it anyway, but if you are good at something, why do it for free? They, too, were betrayed by the Terran Accord. But we're getting sidetracked. My point is, based on elementary cosmology, we should be seeing more sophont species naturally emerge as the universe gets closer to its peak habitability. Do we?

Z: No, the rate of xenosophont discovery has been largely determined by the Affini  Compact's expanding borders. If there are other factors, they're too small to show in the data, and I don't think anyone has done a thorough analysis. You know, Keen, that is interesting. It's not my specialty, but I have a few friends who will love to take that on as a project. How do you mean by peak habitability exactly?

K: I calculate that as the stelliferous era winds down, as star formation slows, the dangerous radiation levels produced by dying stars drops, creating an environment up to 20 times as habitable as the Earth when life first evolved. At the same time, the sheer number of tiny dim stars - each of which could potentially support life-promoting planets - increases the likelihood that life might evolve in the future. These facts render Earth's current inhabitants ""premature"" in the life of the solar system. For a long time, we believed ourselves to be the first -- a possible solution to the Fermi paradox.

Z: And then we proved you wrong.

K: Do you believe that you were the first? Is it an axiom among your people? An article of faith?

Z: I wouldn't call it faith, but we have no evidence to the contrary. At the very least, the first in our home galaxy.

K: That is a very large blind spot you have, for a species that can grow eyes anywhere on their body. Next time you walk past a window, look outside. And next time you walk past a cosmological research station, ask the plant in charge -- why are there patches in the sky?

Z: I don't understand.

K: As you correctly stated, the cosmos did not always have this configuration. But we needn't go past the Big Bang to see it. In the very early universe, just past the inflationary era, the cosmic microwave background had a temperature compatible with liquid water, allowing early rocky planets, if any existed, to have liquid water chemistry on their surface and be habitable, irrespective of their distance from a star. In the standard LCDM cosmology, the first star-forming halos within our Hubble volume started collapsing at these redshifts, allowing the chemistry of life to possibly begin when the Universe was merely 10-17 million years old.

Z: This is the sort of musing one hears from freshmen in university when they've given their metabolism a ride, Keen.

K: Imagine such a primeval race. In a small, accelerated early universe, when a second of ours stretches for days, they grow, they spark intelligence. They quickly realize that they are alone, that their world is inexorably growing colder. What we know as the stelliferous era, they see as the heat death of the universe they know. But - they're smart! Maybe as smart as you. Maybe even as smart as me. And so, they take action. They... terraform. They make small changes to a small universe, to extend their lives. And today, thirteen billion years later, these small changes would have propagated, grown.

Z: That's an interesting story, and it gives me hope for the long-term future of sapience in the universe, but what does it have to do with --

K: Supervoids, Zizania. The Canes Venatici one, the closest to us. Why are there patches in the sky? To survive, to extend its duration, to maintain its domain, something... ate part of the universe. To the unfettered mind, the absence is evidence of presence. Holes in patterns are almost as telling as the patterns themselves. I am not interested in fighting you. I know you are a solvable problem. I'm interested in fighting them.

Z: This is... purely theoretical.

K: I'll be happy to generate a computer model for your cosmologists' perusal. Remember, Zizania: there is always a bigger fish.

I have seen how easy it is for Affini to unsettle other species. Their core-and-vines physiognomy makes them only slightly less effective shapeshifters than the Spectrum Jellies; they subtly undulate with a soothing rythm. A four-meter-tall cat, purring with its whole body, just under the threshold of awareness of a lesser mortal. I admit, I only noticed because of looking at one askew when I was cleaning my ER goggles.

For now, I am grounded, in the sense that I have been politely asked to not use the molecular compiler, not rewire the molecular compiler to obey my commands, and not construct a new molecular compiler from the parts that Zizania is sure I have already generated and left somewhere. Unfortunately, that means interacting with living beings for my food.

Due to their nature, Affini can eat a little bit of almost anything, and barely have a sense of taste, unless they grow it into themselves. This has resulted in a somewhat bland native cuisine and a great interest in the culinary practice of their lessers. Perhaps I should present Trifolium, this ship's captain, with a British flag. I suspect e would take the time to study our history well enough to get the joke; these beings have remarkably little to do in their long lives.

Nevertheless, it impresses me that on this ship, a ten-kilometer-long logistics support vessel that dwarfs most Terran battlecruisers, I am now able to have -- gratis -- a greater subset of Terran food than I would have been able to pay for on most Terran Accord worlds. The Affini have a complex relationship with carnivory, but allow their thralls to use molecular compilers to generate fish and meat that are indistinguishable from the original article. Well, it works for me; I have no bloodlust to sate. I can walk from my hab, or take a clever little maglev tram, and avail myself to pesce in carpione, pizza, escargots, satay -- even, to my dismay, a chili dog. Always had a visceral aversion for chili dogs. It's one of life's little mysteries why.

Zizania has been less keen to talk to Keen in the past few days. We've agreed to not monitor each other's network communications, and I have kept that deal, but she's been spending a fair amount of time talking and writing remotely to acquaintances of hers who have an interest in cosmology and astrobiology.

Finally, a crack in the armor. From observation and the occasional biopsy of Terran Accord executives, I know that the stronger a sophont's confidence is, the more brittle it is. In many ways, domineering types are insects: their exoskeleton is tough, but the flesh within, while powerful, is easy to damage, almost liquid, very susceptible to invasion by parasites. Vertebrates, on the other hand, take cuts, injuries, but their skin grows scars, and is all the stronger for it.

I carve out an exception for myself on this rule, obviously; my confidence is absolute because it comes from experience. I am not arrogant, merely giving myself the credit that is my due and that was refused to me by a corrupt government first and, now, an irritatingly large amount of mildly racist plant aliens. I am Keen; I am a genius; the entire universe will squirm under my gaze. This interlude on an alien ship I consider a well-earned vacation, nothing more.

The other day, Zizania offered me a small dose of what she calls class-A drugs, perhaps to see if I would lose control or, at least, acquiesce to leave the confines of my suit and take a bath. I obliged her. I am not Keen to see my own naked body; it is I who beholds the cosmos, not the other way around. The cosmos must learn that.

The drugs' effect ended abruptly in the middle of my ablution, causing me discomfort. So, in return, yesterday I've discussed cosmology with my host, deposited a little memetic parasite under the exoskeleton of cultural dominance in one of this mighty hive's quadrillion ants: ""there is always a bigger fish"". Zizania, by asking questions of any peers of her who specialize in such matters, has unwittingly been spreading it. We shall see what disruption it brings.

I hate to admit it, but my nose and the sensors in my suit agree with my host: I did need to take a bath. I will endeavor to do so more often while a guest within the Affini ship. As I walked to what has essentially become a food court to retrieve a meal, I noticed a slew of small changes in how other sophonts here approach me, or, rather, how they have stopped keeping a respectful distance, giving weight to the possibility that they were not keeping that distance out of respect after all. A useful data point. I suppose, when in Rome, drive too fast and treat traffic signs as mere suggestions.

Of course, this has caused a problem. During this little trip, my body was assaulted by a Rinan thrall. He, wishing to show appreciation for my continued patronage -- I have been indulging a craving for Kharak-style pizza lately -- made the mistake of propelling his flying-squirrel-like body at mine, and clinging on, in what I am sure he thought was a warm and fluffy hug. It is difficult for me to speak passable Rinan, as I must consciously speed up my thought processes to move my jaw and throat correctly, but I was able to tell him to get off me.

I rarely give commands to other beings, but when I do, I expect them to be obeyed without question or delay; it's healthier for everyone involved. Unfortunately for both of us, he made the stupid choice. Affini medicine is excellent, far above Terran Accord capabilities and, for now, even exceeding my own. The small being will live, and his Affini owner, or guardian, has apologized to me. Nevertheless, I find myself separated from my tools, in a very comfortable hab that they insist is not a brig, trying to make myself talk down to the level of an older Affini who they insist is not a criminal psychologist.

""I am Ginkgoales, he/they, twenty-third bloom. You can call me Dr. Ginkgo if it makes you comfortable."" he says.

""I am Keen."" I reply. If he's read my file, I should need no further introduction.

""Why, yes, yes you are! Such a keen little human.""

I make a point of not reacting. I've interfaced with this sort of professional before, although she was human. She was attempting to determine if I was insane. Insane! Me! It took three entire weeks to make her face the vastness and indifference of the cosmos enough that it was her who they had to drag away, although this did not, as it should have logically been the case, get my then-captors to give me her job. No matter; I escaped through conventional means a few days later.

""What do you need to know, Gingko?""

""Well, first off, I would like to apologize to you. You have suffered what you perceived as an assault, and that is not acceptable. We understand that you acted in self-defense. Do you understand, though, that force-feeding an entire 24 inch pizza to a Rinan is likewise unacceptable? You had a right to push him off, but not to retaliate.""

""I understand. Has the Rinan learned a physics lesson from this? Specifically, conservation of momentum. Noli me tangere.""

""If you understand, I won't insult your intelligence by asking you to not do it again. As to your question, no. The episode was sufficiently traumatic for him that we had to, temporarily, reroute his memory around it. Don't worry, his jaw will be fine. Which brings me to the actual reason why you're here. Your temporary guardian,""

""Host.""

""Your temporary guardian, Zizania, has recently come to me to ask that a particular memory of hers likewise be routed around. A few days ago, you had a conversation with her that significantly affected her well-being. Do you recall yourself using strong language, or bringing up episodes from your or even her past that might trigger a trauma response?""

""No, we were discussing cosmology."" I recite the conversation from memory. The doctor replays the conversation, and I learn that I've made only inconsequential mistakes in the retelling.

""Just so"" the doctor says. ""Well, you're not lying. I suppose that counts as being cooperative.""

""Tell the truth every time but one, and you will be believed that one time. We are cooperating with each other because it is in each of our interests. If you wish to keep score, so far you learned nothing from me, and I've acquired an important data point; a good start. Thank you for the intel, Doctor.""

Now I've ruffled his feathers, or rather leaves. Literally. Affini seem keen to establish gentle dominance; Keen will nip that in the bud. ""Intel?"" Gingko asks me.

""You have admitted that your people routinely prune the memories of your thrall, which I expected, and of your own species, which I did not. And this is only slightly unusual, based on the delay between Zizania's request and our present conversation. I will have to figure out how much this explains of your civilization. Nosce te ipsum, Doctor.""

""Do you speak Latin, or do you only know a few phrases? I know that some exist as relics in the Terran Accord legal system.""

""Nobody speaks Latin. It is a dead language. I can read and write it, with some effort.""

""I'm in my twenty-third bloom, Keen. I was barely a sprout, but I was alive when the tongue was spoken. Our culture is older than the sapiency of your species. Don't think you can manipulate me.""

""Are you calling for a truce, then? Neither of us manipulates the other? Genuine exchange of information? I've been on this ship for two weeks, Doctor. I understand your modus operandi. It is effective against most humans, but I am Keen. If you wish to defeat me in a battle of wits, you'd have to give me a lobotomy. Except, we both know you won't.""

""There have been calls to put you on Class-O xenodrugs. Permanently. After all, you are a murderer, a terrorist, a... Communist symphatiser? Wait, that can't be right.""

""You've been reading my Terran Accord records, i see. My Communism related to my wish to provide every family on my world with a 3d printer. As long as people recognize my intellectual supremacy, I have been very generous. Maybe I'll tell you my side of the story.""

""I look forward to hearing it. But tell me: what would you do if you found someone who's genuinely smarter than you?""

""Acknowledge THEIR intellectual supremacy, of course. I'm not an Affini, doctor. I practice intellectual integrity rather than memory pruning.""

Ruffled the Doctor's leaves, again. Excellent. Now, there's a 75% probability of...

""And just for that quip, Keen, I'm confining you to quarters for a few days. Stay here. I have to tend to Zizania, anyway.""

I allow a thin smile to form on my lips, just enough for him to wonder if it's there. Excellent.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Stynek, Venlil Pet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 5th, 2136*

I was just done having breakfast together with Noah in the human breakroom again. This time my meal was more normal. Diced vegetables, seared and with a side of fresh berries. They were well-salted too! Noah in meantime, had his usual grain slurry. I offered him some berries, but he refused. I still couldn’t figure out when he had time to eat meat, but I felt too awkward to approach that question, so I just ate my own portion.

Well, either way, with the meal done, he gave me a quick headpat and free reign to explore around as long as I wasn’t going to eat anything I found without asking someone first. As if I didn’t already happen to run into the only food stash around the other day. I mean, it’s not like humans hide food all over the place, right? They got refrigerators.

Still, with time to myself and the entire facility to roam, I got to idly walking the hallways, having decided to pay more attention to humans themselves and what they’re doing. There were the guards at some doors, obviously, and it was clear they were there to watch anyone coming through. It was obvious they’d stop me if I tried approaching, and I wasn’t sure if they’d be as gentle as Noah with doing that. Plus, I had no clue what awaited me outside those doors, so I had no reason to want to go there anyway. There are plenty of places still to sate my curiosity.

There were human bathrooms, for example. Stuff there has been bigger than in my own bathroom, and installed even higher. That only further cemented the idea that the bathroom in my own room has been designed specifically for me.

Then there were more practical and familiar places. Like a supply closet! It was full of buckets and mops and bottles of what I assumed were cleaning supplies. I did notice humans stopping and looking at me with concerned looks as I peeked in, so I huffed and closed the door with a slam. I wasn’t stupid enough to drink soap! Those bottles didn’t even look like drink bottles. Did they think I was that stupid?

Eventually I peeked into one of the more generic rooms. An office of sorts, similar to the place where I originally got to experience the human ‘*beer*’, but laid out to be more specifically for individual work. Big desks, separators between them, computers... And there were two humans working there right now. A woman in the far corner, and a familiar man sitting closer to the entrance. I decided to be polite and give him a greeting.

“*Hello, Andes!*” I said, giving him a little wave, mimicking the gesture Noah does when greeting me, but also doing the usual greeting earflick out of habit.

His eyes shot towards me and his eyebrows lifted up. He waved back. “*Hello Stynek! How are you today?*”

I stepped in properly, closing the door behind me, not wanting to talk while just peeking in.

“*I good. Explore.”* I explained to him, flicking my eyes around the room. It was rather boring, with how similar it was to other offices.

I looked over Andes’ own desk instead. It did have a few interesting things on it. Like a big screen, though seemingly designed to function as a picture frame instead, showing various changing photos. Or a diagram with a lot of tables and symbols I've never seen used in either human language or math. And, morbidly, a toy shaped like a human skull, with a plastic brain inside. I guess that's better than a real skull belonging to some prey, at least.

“*Good! What have you found so far?”*

“*Not many new things. I find things for clean. Not eat any.*” I respond, preemptively allaying any concerns.

He was surprised. “...*Uh. Good? Did you try to eat any before?*”

“*No. I know soap bad. But people look like I may eat.*”

“*Ah. The beer incident probably scared them. I’m not worried. Oh, hey! I have been working very hard for months to understand your language, Stynek. Do you want to test how far I have gotten?”* 

I blinked as I processed what he said. I knew humans did occasionally ask me to speak things in venlil, Andes more than others, but not nearly as much as teaching me their own language, and I still felt like I came off as a toddler to them. Though I was curious how far they got…

“*Okay. I listen.*” I respond, ready to hear a human try speaking in my language.

Andes took a deep breath, and said–in a high voice much like a venlil’s, “Hello Stynek, I have name Andes.”

As those sounds came out of the human's mouth, I couldn't help but recoil a bit. I didn't know male humans could even make a voice this high pitched, and female humans only came close. Not to mention that with the words spoken, it did sound so eerily similar to an actual venlil voice. I didn't know humans could do that! Mimicry like that is so weird… But I was still yet to reply to Andes.

“*Voice very venlil. Word like Stynek speak human.*” I tried to portray my impressions of his speech, before offering a correction in my own language. “It's more like… My name is Stynek.”

“My name is Andes,” he echoed nearly perfectly, his pitch getting even closer to my own. I wasn't even sure if he grasped the grammar so easily or just repeated after me there.

“Yes. Like that.” I simply affirmed. I still had no clue how to feel about speaking to a human in venlil like that, everything about this just felt so alien and weird.

“We will see if we can get more Venlil words from other-place box very far. But if you help, we learn faster.” 

I tilted my head, starting to get a bit confused at vague phrasing. *Is that how I sound to humans? I hope I don't sound like that…*

“Get more from box? Do you mean translators? You have those?” I asked, hoping that humans picked up enough of my words for Andes to understand at least vaguely.

“Yes. We not know Venlil words, because… big predator translator box not know venlil words. But we want venlil friends, like you, so we learn.”

I blinked blankly, trying to figure out what in the world any of that meant. Big predator translator? Want venlil friends? 

“Predator translator…?” I asked, before switching to human, as, ironically, my own language lacked one if the words I wanted to use. “*Carnivore translator? Humans omnivore, no? Herbivore need another translator?*”

“*No, the problem is–Well, we got translator technology from–”*

“*Andes?*” A human voice called out from the other end of the room. “*I'm not sure that's a good topic for her…*”

I looked to the side to see the female human standing to the side, having been watching us talking, seemingly for some time now. How did I not notice?

“...*Right. Right. Sorry, um… I mean…”*

I blinked, wondering what it was that just occurred. Andes seemed to be stumbling over his words, so the woman spoke again. 

“*Hello, Stynek. I don't think we officially met. I'm Kiara. Nice to meet you.*”

“*Hello, Kiara. Nice to meet you.*” I repeated the response to the common human introduction. “*You listen to us?*” I asked as a follow up. 

“*Yes. Sorry, but it was pretty funny seeing Andes here do that high pitched falsetto. Almost wish I recorded that.*” She chuckled, looking over at Andes with amusement.

“*I can do it again, if you want,”* he said, in English, but still high like a venlil. “*I based it on my Mickey Mouse impression.*”

That somehow was just as off-putting as when he spoke in venlil. Humans as big as him aren’t supposed to make noises this high! But Kiara did not seem to be perturbed in the slightest.

“*So, Stynek.*” Kiara returned to addressing me. “*What are your impressions of humans so far? I hope Noah isn't being too overbearing.*”

“*Humans nice. Noah very nice. He care a lot. Like mom and dad.*” I explain, though realizing that I was drawing the comparison made me remember my parents. The painful thought made my ears droop and I forgot what else I was going to say.

*“Oh, can you tell us more about them?”* Andes asked. “*We don’t know when you will be able to go home, but we would like to reunite you eventually.”*

“*Andes…!*” Kiara nearly hissed, startling me. Then, to my surprise, all her words were unfamiliar. “*Se te olvidó de dónde es? Tienen que estar muertos, o en una de esas ‘granjas’. No en su planeta, sanos y salvos.*”

Then Andes responded, sounding very similarly, but equally incomprehensible.

“*Eso no lo sabemos. Es perfectamente posible que tenga familia sobreviviente, aún que no sean sus papás. Eventualmente vamos a tener que llevarla a su planeta. Sería útil saber acerca de su familia.*”*.* 

“*Es una niña, sola, que duerme con un dibujo de su mamá bajo su almohada. Y ni siquiera podemos prometer que la vamos a regresar a casa.""* Kiara glanced over at me, her face carrying a familiar expression of suppressed pain I often saw on Noah. “*Solo… no digas que no te avisaron, si Noah viene corriendo porque ella se puso a llorar por recordar el tema.*”

Andes lifted his hands in non-aggression. “*Alright, alright…* *Stynek, do you want to talk about your parents? Or something else? Do you know how to read and write in Venlil language?”* 

I just stared at him. The two just spoke some other language, right? But it didn’t sound that different, it was just all the words being unfamiliar. Was it some cypher? It was not the first time humans avoided talking around me, I was used to Noah getting pulled outside my room for talks before returning. This felt different though. I feel like I just learned a lot from the interrupted topic.

Still, after processing it a bit, I gave Andes an affirmative earflick, before remembering humans don’t understand those and adding out loud.

“*I can. Learn at school.*” I responded. That is one of the things I haven’t shown the humans. Our script.

“*Fantastic!”* Andes said, almost jumping to his feet with happiness. “*I called it! I totally called it. Stynek, if I give you a new sketchbook, and draw things with their name in English, will you write their name in Venlil?”*

“*Yes. Easy.*” I flick my ears again. “*Can write without picture. Want?*” I also offered, as I wasn’t sure I wanted to fully draw something right now.

Andes moved his head up and down very quickly, almost vibrating with excitement. “*Yes, yes yes yes please.*”

He pulled out a book with lines, and flicked through some pages before getting to an empty one. Then he drew a table surprisingly quickly. 

“*Table.*”

Table? Why table?

I tilted my head. Horizontal lines made it look like I had to fit things between them, but I could at best fit a very small word, definitely not ‘table’. So I took Andes’ pen, rubbing it a bit with my digits, all human drawing and writing implements always feeling just a bit too small, before writing a word between the lines in venscript. A simplest, shortest word.

Then I point to it and announce its meaning to Andes.

“Hello!” I say in venlil, before switching to human. “*Mean ‘hello’!*”

Kiara seemed to find something about it particularly funny, as she had to stifle a laugh, putting her hand over her mouth. I wasn’t sure why. Did I do something wrong? I turned my eyes back to Andes. 

He chuckled. “*Ah. Good. Good ‘hello’, please write the venlil word for ‘table’.”*

I turned my attention back to the paper, when it suddenly hit me. I turned the page sideways, and started writing out the word, still staying between the lines. I moved the pen with quick, sharp, firm strokes, lining the letters up vertically to connect to one another, before presenting it to Andes.

“Table.”

That got Kiara chuckling again, as the picture of the table now was sideways relative to the word written.

Andes gasped, clearly excited. “*It's vertical! Oh this is so cool–let me flip the next one for you.”*

He took the notepad back, flipped the page, then turned it sideways, before drawing a table again. This time, he also drew a fruit. “*The fruit is on the table.*”

I couldn’t help but stare at Andes for a bit as his excitement, combined with his general presence, was a bit overwhelming. I felt my tail lower, but still took the notepad, instructions now being clear. *I am supposed to write what he just said, but in venlil, and pictures are probably more for him.* And I didn’t have to worry about which fruit it was meant to be, since venlil didn’t really have words for any human fruit and I had no clue how to translate human noises to our letters properly.

I grabbed the pen out of Andes’ hands and wrote the sentence down, running it vertically besides the picture. The writing did turn out a bit smaller than I was used to, with the size of the lines, but I was told my handwriting could be neater before, so it was good practice, especially with me not writing anything for many months now!

I offered the notepad back to the excited language human, who took it eagerly right out of my paws. 

“*Ball is under the table,*” he said, having now drawn a ball under the table. 

His drawing of a ball looked almost exactly like his drawing of a fruit, but I chose not to critique him, and instead just wrote down exactly what he said. I wasn’t sure if I should describe it as ‘table above ball’ or ‘ball beneath table’, now that he was using slight variations, but I wound up choosing to go with my gut feeling of using the opposite to the fruit example. Word order changed from the other one with that. Humans seemed to have their language full of such detailed specifics yet with strict order to it… Probably why I struggle with their constantly-changing action words.

I handed the pad back to Andes, who somehow looked giddier with every new thing I wrote down.

“*This is so cool. It looks like pointier, vertical Shavian! Okay, okay. How about… the ball is inside the box.”* 

He drew a box with a ball inside it. I examined the drawing, this depiction being a lot less ambiguous. But just as I finished writing out the sentence he asked, the door opened and Noah came in, quickly giving me a wave.

“*Hello, Stynek.*” He then paused and acknowledged the other humans in the room. “*Andes. Kiara. Just picking her up, medical wants to do another scan. I think they’re planning to finalize the new prosthetic plans next week.*”

I passed the notepad back to Andes, turning my head towards Noah with a wave.

“*Hi, Noah! Sample?*”

“*Yes, sample time.*” He responded, noticing me passing the pad over. “*I’m not interrupting anything too important I hope?*”

“*Just Andes here doing his best Stynek impression and geeking out over some lines on paper.*” Kiara responded with a chuckle.

“*They have a vertical writing system!”* he declared, nearly jumping when he got it. “*It doesn't seem to have declensions, it doesn't seem to rely heavily on a to-be verb, unless it's worked into one of the nouns–Noah this is amazing she should have been writing for weeks. Imagine if she had a diary! And–and–this is so cool. Also, I can speak enough Venlil for Stynek to understand and provide feedback, so the mapping is going well!”*

“*I am not sure about a diary, unless you want that, Stynek?*” Noah asked me as he lowered to his knee before me.

I took a few moments to consider. I knew some people liked those, but I never felt the draw. But it might be cool to record my time spent here, and it might help the humans, so after consideration I gave him an affirmative earflick.

“*I can write diary. Easy.*” I said, turning my head a bit towards Andes. “*Can translate. Complicated, but try.*” I offered, handing him the notepad back. “*Write things for translate. If can not read, will ask Noah, he read for me. Now, samples.*”

Andes nodded very quickly and set out to write different sentences in Human on the notepad. 

I took the notepad from him, quickly handing it to Noah for keeping. I didn’t have anywhere to put it on me right now. He took it and folded it into his bag before leaning towards me, arms open.

“*Carry?*” He offered simply.

I started hopping in place with excitement… And by that I mean, hopping on my intact leg, while the metal one remained firmly on the ground.

“*Yes! Carry!*” I happily agreed and was quickly scooped up by Noah and raised up. Being carried around like that felt so nice. I may have gotten used to my prosthetic, but it was still faster to have him carry me, and it was like a cuddle on the go. “*Bye, Andes, bye, Kiara!*” I waved to the two humans, as Noah started carrying me out.

He waved back, and spoke in that high-pitched voice. “Bye Stynek!”

Kiara also responded with a small wave and a smile.

With that, I relaxed in Noah's cradled arms, enjoying my ride to the scanning room. Humans always seem to get caught up on weirdest things. Noah with things I eat, Andes with my language. I couldn't help but wonder if the weird fixations were just a human thing or general omnivore thing… or I was just lucky to get these specific humans around me.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Dr. Erin Kuemper, UN Secretary of Alien Affairs***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 5th, 2136*

Today was the first time I had a proper sleep in months. Which was, surprisingly, not necessarily a good thing, considering that it took me being on a small cargo ship haphazardly repurposed into a diplomatic vessel, bound to Arxur space. The ride wasn’t going to be long, but it was slightly less than a full day, meaning I had time to rest. And now that I was finally awake, and had eaten my private rations, I had time to get to know my bodyguards.

On this trip, we had minimal crew, in good part because there weren’t too many volunteers. Pilot and ship guards will be staying in this ship the whole time, while me and my two bodyguards will actually be going out and about on the arxur world. First human to take a step on an alien planet… I wished the idea sparked joy in me, rather than dread. At least I won’t be alone.

Before going to sleep, I quickly skimmed the files of the two bodyguards. Both UN soldiers already, although they were curious choices, neither having any experience in this specific type of assignment. And I was curious to learn more about them. So, I headed out of my private quarters and into the ‘common room’ which was just an empty room with a table and a few chairs. There both of them were. A man and a woman, wearing standard UN uniform. Both quickly stood up from their seats as I came in, saluting me.

“Ambassador.” The woman, Lisa Reynolds, acknowledged me.

“At ease, soldiers.” I spoke. “No need for such strictness when there’s no situation happening. The atmosphere will be oppressive enough as is, I don’t know if i can handle this military rank stuff too…”

“Are you sure, ma’am? Will that not make a bad impression on the arxur?” She asked.

“I’m sure. Trust me, I interacted with them plenty. As long as you fall in line when I actually do give orders, and you don’t question me in public, they won’t question my own authority.” I explained, sitting down. The two soldiers hesitated, but got seated as well.

“So… Is it Ambassador Kuemper, or Secretary Kuemper?” The male soldier, Marcel Fraser, asked me.

“It’s Erin, or Dr. Kuemper. Ambassador works best if you really have to pull the rank.” I answered.

“You’re much more… relaxed than expected, ma’am. In context of… everything.” Lisa commented.

“I had my first good sleep in a long while. Speaking of, what’s the ETA on our arrival? I haven’t checked in yet.”

“About an hour, ma’am.” Marcel replied. “You’ve been out for a while.”

“I see… Well, while we’re waiting, I was curious. Answering isn’t mandatory here, just indulge me if you would.” I began, turning my attention entirely to the male bodyguard. “Marcel, your file said you used to be a vegetarian, and assisted animal rescues on the side. Don’t take it the wrong way, but how did someone like you wind up volunteering to go on a diplomatic mission to arxur space?”

“Do you distrust me, Dr. Kuemper?” Marcel asked.

“No. In good part because I don’t believe General Jones would vet someone who plans to sabotage the meeting, but also because I would hope nobody would be this suicidal on behalf of whole humanity. So… What was it?”

Marcel chuckled, shaking his head.

“It was a hope for the best.” He said cryptically, pausing before proceeding to elaborate. “They are people, like us. And the whole point of us still interacting with them is… That we’re hoping to help them improve, right? Well, I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted to be there and do exactly that. So much suffering being inflicted out of this twisted false sense of necessity… Their dogma, full of pointless hatred… I want to be there, to help steer them towards empathy and compassion. To make them see the error of their ways.”

I tapped my finger on the table, thinking about it. He certainly didn’t seem malicious, but I wasn’t sure if he was the best option, with how seemingly intent on pursuing that personal goal of his he was. I wonder why Jones selected him. Surely there were less opinionated volunteers…

On the other hand, he wasn’t wrong either. That’s exactly what we collectively hope to do in our diplomatic interactions with the arxur - make them see the error of their ways and show that their ‘necessity’ has never been necessary at all. That there is a world where there can be prosperity and happiness in peace and acceptance. As cheesy as that may sound when I put it like that.

“I see. I suppose there will be opportunities for that.” I respond, trying to avoid casting any immediate judgements on the soldier’s goals.

“Are you sure, ma’am?” Lisa asked. “We will be shadowing you all the time. I doubt there will be much opportunity to chat with the locals.”

“Maybe not. I don’t expect you two to be statues following me around still. The arxur originally intended to provide all security themselves, I was only given an escort as extra contingency.” I explained. “Not that I don’t value your work, I simply doubt you’ll need to do much, and I definitely won’t dissuade you from talking with the arxur on your own. Any information we can glean from the visit can be important.”

“I see. Thank you, ma’am.” Lisa nodded.

“What about you, Lisa? What motivated you to volunteer?” I switched the topic, going back to learning more about my bodyguards.

“Ironically, opposite reasons of Fraser here.” She said, shooting a side glance at Marcel, who just rolled his eyes. “It’s because I was one of the soldiers who didn’t have too strong of objections towards the arxur culture.”

“You… didn’t?” I asked, bewildered at that.

“Don’t take it the wrong way, ma’am. Their actions are reprehensible and I wholeheartedly support the idea that we should influence them for the better.” She clarified. “But at the same time, from what we know of their history, they simply did what they had to do to survive. Until we came along, they had no escape from the vicious cycle they were forced into.”

“There is always a choice…” Marcel muttered, though audibly enough to be heard.

“Choosing between doing evil and dying is not a choice, Fraser.” Lisa huffed.

“When it looks like there are no good options, you make one. You don’t resign yourself to evil and accept it, Reynolds.” Marcel pushed further, his tone growing more irritated.

“And what would that third option be in case of the arxur? You read about them more than me.”

“There are many options! Go look for cattle elsewhere, leave Federation behind entirely. Develop the same bioprinting technology we have. Anything that’s not treating people like animals!” He exclaimed.

“And how many more billions of their own people would have died by the time they found a solution?” Lisa quipped back. Her lips were tightly pushed together, so despite her seemingly calm tone, she was also growing irritated.

“Less than the amount of people they killed and ate.” The male soldier shoots back.

“So what, are you saying the arxur should have just collectively died as a species?”

“And are you saying it was okay for them to drive dozens of species to extinction? They weren’t shy about sharing those conquests, they’re proud of it.”

“...I assume this isn’t the first time you two are having this conversation?” I interject, making the two soldiers flinch and quickly straighten out, looking at me instead of glaring at each other.

“Yes, ma’am. Sorry, ma’am.” Lisa responds.

“We find it hard to find middle ground on the topic, ma’am.” Marcel added.

“That’s fine. Just… I’m not asking either of you to change your minds, but that’s an example of something I’d like to see less of when we are out there. Expressing your opinions is not something I’ll forbid, but I do not want to present ourselves as too divided… or too antagonistic towards the arxur.” I explained. “Plus… It’s all past anyway. We’re here to build a future, making sure this past is left behind.”

Marcel smiled and nodded.

“Right. Sorry ma’am, I’ll try to keep myself in check.”

“That’s something we can agree on at least.” Lisa followed up.

“Good. We’ll be the faces of humanity when we make it there, and even if I am the official ambassador and arxur will be directing their talking to me, I’d like us all to put our best impression forward.” I smiled at the bodyguards, who nodded to me in sync, and reclined in my seat, relaxing.

Alright. I can only hope their discipline holds up, and this little argument wasn’t a bad sign of things to come. Though being chosen by Jones should be an indicator of quality in that regard, so I wasn’t too worried.

What I was worried about was the arxur. I knew that we tried to put our best forward, I saw through Meier assigning a SETI researcher as both an ambassador and Secretary of Alien Affairs. And however temporary he claimed my posting as ambassador was, ‘until we need more than one’, I doubted that my troubles would end there. Which made me wonder… Were the arxur doing the same? Putting the best they have forward to attempt impressing and convincing us?

But if so, then which standard did they use? We used our own, but from everything we know of them, they couldn’t have used theirs. Unless their best is pretty pathetic by their views of true arxur qualities. Kaisal was explicitly seen as a defective runt within their society, for a horrible crime of being naturally short and lithe. And Coth… Well, he definitely put forward the air that arxur seemed to want to put forward as a whole, but his constant puppy-like eagerness to interact with us, to talk and learn about humans, it was about as un-arxur as it could get, by their own belief system. With what we know of Chief Hunter Isif, the monster that had Stynek butchered in front of our astronauts, I knew they had better if they wanted to present the best of arxur. Then does that mean that Coth and Kaisal are best they had for appealing to humans?

My silent musing was interrupted by the intercom coming to life, pilot’s voice coming out of it.

“Attention, ambassador, bodyguards. We’re exiting FTL, followed immediately by setting a trajectory for landing. Expect light turbulence.”

“We’re here…” Lisa mumbled, holding tighter onto her seat. Myself and Marcel followed suit as the ship jolted momentarily. The engineers didn’t even have time to install advanced impact dampeners for this ship when it was being refitted.

And then there was the feeling of slow transition from artificial to natural gravity as we proceeded to enter the atmosphere of the planet. We didn’t have time to observe it directly, and I didn’t want to distract the pilot now of all times by going to the cockpit to take a look out of the observation window.

So, instead I gave a quick nod and went back to my quarters. The soldiers understood the gesture and headed towards their own small rooms.

In about ten minutes we were all standing in front of the unloading bay. I had a suitcase with my personal belongings with me, while the soldiers were carrying weapons on their backs and large trunks, containing their own belongings and food, if I had to guess. This is just like another business trip. Just to another planet and with an alien culture.

I took a deep breath. I felt the vibration of atmospheric entry as I was checking the contents of my suitcase, so I knew we were likely landing already, so I held onto the railing. And soon there was a thump, followed by stillness. The intercom came to life again.

“Ambassador, bodyguards, prepare to disembark. We have successfully landed on the surface of Brissa, an arxur colony world. The doors will be opening shortly, be ready.”

I took a breath and stood by the large unloading ramp. I heard Marcel and Lisa take places at my sides. That’s it. I’m doing it.

With a hiss the large unloading ramp started lowering, revealing light from outside the ship. It was a sunny day where we were landing, first thing I saw being a particularly cyan sky. As ramp lowered further, I saw big, blocky buildings in the distance, dark and utilitarian, clearly of arxur make. And once it fully lowered I saw what was right in front of the landing pad.

An entire detachment of arxur, all in combat harnesses and armed, lined up in military formation, forming a long passageway for me to go down. And at the far end of it, there was a trio of familiar arxur waiting for me. I’d never been around so many lizards before. So I took another deep breath and started walking, focusing everything on keeping my breath even. Holding back my anxiety at the amount of arxur present, and my excitement as my shoe took its first step on the concrete below.

I kept walking, Marcel and Lisa following right after, our translator-drones wheeling after us, each following their designated human. I avoided making eye contact with the arxur soldiers around us, but I didn’t need to to feel every single pair of piercing eyes focusing on me. We were a new sight on this planet, a novelty. I wonder what those soldiers feel now. Awe? Disappointment?

I had to resist casting a glance back to check on my bodyguards, as I moved forward, eventually reaching the huge and imposing form. I remembered this arxur, Chief Hunter Isif. Last I saw him was on that first broadcast communication with Elias. He never personally involved himself with human interactions since, aside from a few short negotiation calls with Secretary-General. So him being here either meant this was more important than usual, or that his tactics changed.

“Greetings, Secretary Erin Kuemper.” Isif began. “And welcome to the planet of Brissa. One of my larger farming worlds.”

Coth and Kaisal both gave me a quick nod of greetings. I collected myself and spoke.

“Greetings, Chief Hunter Isif. I am glad to be welcomed by such a grand welcome party.” I started diplomatically. “The ships carrying the supplies for our trade remain in orbit, waiting for instructions.”

“That is well. That said, it is not the trade that is the biggest occasion today. There will be talking to be done, but not now. First, I want you to be able to enjoy the hospitality after a long trip.” Isif said, his tail swiping harshly, Coth quickly stepping forward.

“Greetings, Secretary Kuemper. We have prepared accommodations for you and your entourage. If you would proceed to our transport vehicle, we will bring you there and you can rest. From there we can work on the schedule for the visit as a whole.” He spoke. His tone was much more reserved and restrained than usual, eagerness badly concealed. The lizard was excited, but afraid to show it. And I had a good guess why…

“I appreciate your hospitality.” I reply with a small polite nod. “I look forward to learning more about arxur way of life and deepening the ties between our people.”

My stomach twisted a bit saying that. As much as the sentiment was true, maintaining polite tone was hard, knowing full well what the purpose of this planet as a whole was to the arxur.

“Then I will send word when I am ready to talk. Until then, Coth will attend to any of your needs.” Isif said, stepping aside.

Coth, in turn, motioned for me to follow. The corridor formed by the arxur continued forward, all the way to the vehicle. A large, armored car-like thing, looking more like a military jeep.

I followed after him, leaving Isif behind. Seems like Chief Hunter had his own schedule for now, and no plans to talk yet. That was good, because I definitely was not ready yet.

Once we got to the jeep, I realized that there were three portions to it. Front portion was just for the driver, a large arxur already sitting there. Coth proceeded to the middle portion, and looked at me to follow, while Kaisal motioned towards Lisa and Marcel to head into the back. I suppose that was to be expected, so I quietly entered, leaving my suitcase behind, Kaisal expectedly grabbing it and loading it in as well. Coth even loaded my translator drone into our ‘VIP’ section without any prompting. Almost gentlemanly.

And then… we were off, riding down the empty road, past fields of green towards that large settlement full of those blocky buildings. I focused my attention on the windows, hoping to appreciate the scenery, but it was primarily farmland. All for cattle feed. And all the same crop, some sort of grain. In the distance, I could see automated harvesting drones working their duty, though nobody else, arxur or otherwise.

“I hope your travel here was pleasant, Erin Kuemper.” Coth spoke suddenly, filling the air with small talk.

“It was my first time traveling FTL.” I replied. “It was smoother than I expected, even though I was warned it would be bumpy.”

“That is good. I hope there will be many an opportunity in the future for you to travel to us yet.” Coth spoke, his facial features shifting towards an expression I recognized as happy. Learning to pay attention to the way the arxur were expressing themselves paid off.

“If our relations continue to develop, certainly.” I replied diplomatically, still looking out the window.

“We made preparations by your request. All food will be from the trade, so you will not have to worry about consuming anything…” He paused, suddenly catching himself. “...alien.”

“That is good. We have made sure to bring supplies to last us a week, but I am glad for the hospitality.” I continued the light non-responses, before pivoting into a question. “That said, I am still curious why your Chief Hunter requested this personal meeting, only to leave me be once I am here.”

Coth lowered his head, his tail shifting nervously.

“I cannot speak on behalf of His Savageness… But I do believe he wanted you to see us, and our lives.” He said uncertainly.

“Does that mean I will get to see the local sights?” I ask, and before Coth has a chance to answer, continue. “That’s good. That was going to be among my requests already.”

“Really? Oh, this is gladdening to hear–” Coth began, only for me to interrupt him.

“...I was interested in seeing arxur farming operations for a while now.”

That got him clammed up suddenly. His head lowered and his tail flicked more with that nervous twitch, and his response only came after an awkward pose.

“I am sure that… I can add that to the schedule of your visit. If you’re sure that’s something you wish to see…”

Part of me almost wanted to describe his tone as regretful, but that may have been my wishful thinking.

“Ah. We’re here.” He spoke again.

It seems the place we were going to stay was on the outskirts. A building as utilitarian as others on outside, big, grey and blocky like arxur themselves. That said, it did seem to be some sort of residential building at least, and architecture aside, from the general shape and layout, almost looked like an embassy.

“This will be the temporary embassy location for your stay, and for the stay of any other human delegates to this planet.” Coth explained. “You can consider the whole building yours.”

“That is generous of you.” I said, stepping out of the vehicle, and dragging my translator drone out on my own this time. Coth quickly went after me and caught up, leading me inside. Within was… well, an embassy. Furniture was mostly metallic and simplistic, lacking any artistic representation, the place looking more like a sterile laboratory, but the layout was familiar. While Marcel, Lisa and Kaisal were left behind, Coth led me all the way to the quarters, showing me to what will be my room for the foreseeable future. The room, to my surprise, was actually… decent. A large bed, a proper cabinet for clothes, making me wonder if they made one just for humans, a cupboard and mirrors, several work desks just in case and an adjacent bathroom…

“I hope your stay will be pleasant and enlightening.” Coth said. “The communicator device on the desk will allow you to contact me, and allow His Savageness to contact you. Please keep it on yourself.” He explained, pointing to an arxur model holopad on one of the desks. “Settle in for the day. Local daylight cycle is nineteen human hours, and we can begin sightseeing tomorrow.”

With that he simply nodded at me before heading out. And once he was outside, I closed the door, headed towards the bed, and let myself collapse on it. I wasn’t tired at all from the trip, but I needed some time to process everything. I am on an alien planet, surrounded almost exclusively by aliens… And about to learn how they live first hand. This is incredible… But there was still this constant sense of dread, from knowing what kind of aliens they were and what they did. Describing this place as a wolf den would be the closest idiom I can think of. So for now I decided to close my eyes and try to gather my bearings, taking another short nap.

Sorry it has been so long since I posted a chapter. Life got in the way. Works been a slog and I have had to do some home remodel type stuff.

But here you go. Enjoy.

I forgot to add, this piece is a bit out of order. This takes place before - The Mercy of Humans: Part 69 - Lost. I felt the need to add it in. If you go to my AO3 pages, I can reorder them there.

Seven days of constant combat wears you down. Surviving on less than minimal sleep, way too many stimulants, barely enough food to replace the calories you burn, and putting all your grief into a small box you can deal with later. If you survive. Combat in space is mostly sterile. You never see the enemy face to face. Often, the enemy is just an icon on your holoscreen.

When the enemy shoots missiles at you, you can see them coming for a long, long time. This makes planning countermissile fire easy. At least you’d think so. The problem is the enemy knows this and launches wave after wave of thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of missiles. There is a perpetual arms race between better weapons and better defenses. The offensive missiles have jammers, decoys, and other targeting aids. Defenders have to overcome these to be effective. Often, it is using the same technique as the attackers. Simply use more countermissiles.

Countermissiles are a bare fraction of the size of a ship launched missile. They do not use explosives, but rather generate a large bow shield that it uses to destroy incoming fire. It normally destroys the countermissile, too. But the human R&D had developed a large countermissile that cannot be launched from a ship. They are launched from a planet or battlestation. These countermissiles are the size of a starfighter. They mount no weapons or life support systems. They are simply a large drive module and shield generator. The shields they generate are over a thousand kilometers in diameter and can take multiple hits before being destroyed.

Their only weakness is they cannot handle an explosion from the incoming missiles. The shields are just strong enough to take out the incoming missiles long before they are set to detonate. Their biggest strength was that the enemy had never seen them and therefore had no idea how to deal with them.

The humans in Ikenga did not have an unlimited supply of them, so they’d held back from using them until the situation was so dire, they had no choice. Reinforcements had still not arrived, and the situation was now dire. Of the fifty-one capital ships of the Ikenga defensive fleet, only twenty one still survived, and all of them were damaged. Fifty three percent of the orbital defense platforms were gone. Seventy one percent of the system defense starfighters were gone. The large orbital forts were still fighting, but none were undamaged.

The humans had destroyed almost twice as much tonnage as they’d lost. Any sane enemy would have retreated long ago. But the enemy had skulked around the outer system, lobbing missiles at the planet and defenses. They apparently had enough munitions to resupply their expenditures, because they kept attacking.

The enemy hadn’t sent anything insystem for almost eight hours. This respite allowed the human crews to rest, replenish munitions, repair combat damage, and bring in replacement personnel. But the enemy had resupplied, too. That meant this latest salvo was huge.

“That’s a big one,” Captain Rose Parker said. She then shook herself when she realized she’d said it out loud. “Sorry, Admiral.”

“You didn’t say anything the rest of us aren’t already thinking,” I said. “I didn’t think they had that many launchers left.”

“Time for the *Linebackers*?” Commander Tomas Ellesworth asked.

“Yeah, Tom. When they are within ten light minutes, send them,” I ordered. “With every available fighter we have left, half with countermissile pods and the other with shipkillers. With the *Linebackers* to clear the way, we should be able to get all the *Stilettos* and *Razors* into knife fighting range. Since the fleet has been resupplied, let’s just empty their magazines and reload.”

It was an unintentional joke and got just a few grim smiles from my command staff.

“What about the planetary missiles?”  My chief of staff, Captain Johan Westerbrook, asked.

“Let’s hold off on them until we see the enemy’s reaction,” I replied.

“Why, sir?” Lieutenant Commander Kahakuhale Kalei asked. “It’s not like we are running out, and if we have any chance of overloading their defenses, not is it.”

My Intel Officer had a point. I am not so proud as to ignore subordinate’s ideas. So I simply asked the room, “Opinions?”

“Kalei has a point” Ellesworth said. “Popping the *Linebackers* on them might surprise them. But they haven’t been shy about wasting missiles on us. The big missiles might be the tipping point.”

“I have an idea. It is kind of out there, but…” Junior Grade Lieutenant Đurđa Balaban said. She was one of my most junior staff, but she was not shy about giving an opinion, even an unpopular one, when asked.

“Go ahead.”

“Between the fleet and system defense, we have three hundred ten working fighters. Arming half of the with counter missile pods gives us internal thirty Mark Eighty-twos apiece, that’s ninety-three hundred. The anti-shipping pods give us another thirty-one hundred Mark One-fifteens. Tractor one of the big Mark Thirties to each fighter. They’ll see the fighters coming and expect their missiles. But those three hundred and ten Mark Thirties mixed in will be a nasty surprise. And if we use forty-five percent decoys and jammers instead of thirty? We can shepherd them enough to get a lot of them on target.”

“How much would that much extra mass affect the fighter’s performance?”

“Not much, really. Maybe a little more reactor mass on the initial outbound phase. But that’s nothing really. They will be more sluggish on the helm until missile separation. Then, it is business as usual. And really, there is no reason not to cut them loose after the fighters go ballistic. Since the fighters have no way to launch them, cutting them loose to fly ballistic until the fighters launch theirs.”

“Hell, sir. That idea can be improved on too,” Thomas said after a moment. “Have the fighters tractor two Mark Thirties to their hulls, get to ballistic speeds and cut them loose. Then the fighters all turn around and head back to base. We can do that over and over and over. I figure maybe make it look like we are sortieing out as feints. Or even just start lobbing them even at lower speeds.”

“Yeah, Tom, but that would take a lot of time,” I replied. “And that is something we don’t have. Let’s keep that in our toolbox for next time. Lieutenant Balaban, you see what it would take to set it up, and I’ll let you bulldog it. If you get pushback, let me know immediately.”

“Aye-aye, sir. I’ll get right on it.” 

I could see her eyes lose focus as she linked with her workstation and started crunching numbers. I felt a twinge of jealousy at how easily she did it. I struggle with the military link sometimes. Call me old fashioned, but I like to see a screen and use a keyboard. Of course, my son would call me archaic. Perhaps I am.

“Alrighty, then. What’s else on the agenda?”  Since the invasion, our meetings had become shorter, more intense, and to the point. The threat of being killed was nothing new to the Navy. The threat of losing an entire planet? That was not something we dealt with often. It brought our mission into laser-like focus. We’d do everything in our power to kill every single enemy and ensure they don’t return ever again.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

We have been coasting on ballistic for over three hours. We had no active drives, sensors, or shields. The ops plan started us inside the orbit of the second planet, boosting on reduced power until we reached maximum velocity. That took just over four hours. Yeah, we could have gotten to max speed faster, but the power flare from the driver nodes would show up on the enemy sensors like New Years fireworks. This approach was stealthier, and we hoped it kept us off the enemy’s sensors until the last moment.

At least, that is the plan. It had my father’s stamp of approval, so I had to believe it was going to work.

“Seven minutes to missile separation, Pooch,” I said.

Normally, a missile launch was done by the weapons officer. But the big Mark Thirty tractor clamped to our hull was not under her control, but Pooch’s. The flight engineer had control over the tractor system.

“Right-o, boss. Say Jeff, whatcha gon’ do when all dis be over, eh?”

“Take a long fucking nap? Go on vacation? Hell, I don’t know. We gotta survive it first.” Then I thought, *Perhaps get married? That is if Bailey says yes. But I don’t want to think about that just now. Because the thought of not coming home to her hurt too bad.*

“Dat be a good idea, a damned good idea. I be so tired I could sleep a t’ousand years. Maybe.”

“You two should concentrate on the job,” Kylie groused.

Something has been bothering her for the past eight hours as we boosted slowly towards the outer system. I haven’t known them long, but her attitude was a complete one-eighty from her normal self. It worried me a bit. For a thrown together at the last moment crew, we’d developed into a good team and her demeanor was a bit off-putting.

I switched to a private channel, and asked, “Kylie, what’s eating at you? You’ve been abrasive and cranky since the mission started.”

“I’m sorry, sir. But I can’t explain it. It is just that I have a really bad feeling about this,” she explained. “It’s a kind of dread in my gut… I just feel like I am not coming back from this mission.”

“Hunh. I don’t know what to tell you. Some of us won’t come home. That’s part of the reality of fighter ops. I accepted that long ago. But if you believe we are going to die, then you might make mistakes. We are fighter crews. We have to believe we are immortal. Death is for lesser mortals. It ain’t going to happen to us,” I told her.

“I have always been liked that... But this time, I got a cold knot in my stomach. I even recorded a message to my parents before we launched. In case I didn’t make it.”

“I did, too. I think we all do something like that for the people we love. That said, we need your head in the game. You are the most important person on this ship. I might fly it, but you are the one who fights it.”

She was silent for a few moments before responding. “Don’t worry about that. I have pretty solid motivation to keep us alive, right?”

“Right. Just remember the enemy is out there, not in here. Okay? Otherwise you’ll hurt Pooch’s feelings.”

“Yes sir, I understand.”

So far, even though both of them were technically under my command, I had not really done much actual commanding. Mainly I had just been flying this crate. We’d been able to stand down for a bit before this mission. It was the first real sleep and good meals we’d had in days.

We had needed that downtime desperately. Intel figured that the enemy was repairing battle damage and replenishing their expendable munitions. They’d been lobbing missiles in system at a shocking rate. The amount of money the missiles and ships lost or damaged cost is mindboggling. It had to be beyond the multi-trillion dollar range.  

“Missile separation,” Pooch announced.

The squadron used chemical reaction thrusters to jink the fighters up and starboard just a bit to give the missile some distance from our hulls. Being too close when their drives light up would be a mistake. They could easily shred our hulls if we are too close.

“And now the waiting game begins,” I announced.

“You mean, de waitin game begins again. We already been waitin. It do seem fighter ops be a lot o’waitin around. At least our flight couches are comfortable. I read that back on Terra, early military equipment was cramped and uncomfortable. I don’ understand why dem engineers couldn’t make the chairs comfy, eh?”

“It is because people who design those things didn’t have to use or repair them,” Kylie replied. “We see that occasionally still. Luckily, the major systems on the *Razors* are modular and can be removed whole and repaired in much less cramped conditions.”

“Yah, dere should be a special place in hell for design engineers who make shit too hard to work on,” Pooch agreed.

The Ops plan had us on ballistic for another six hours. Then the *Linebackers* would spool up and lead the way. The Mark Thirties are programmed to mimic our fighter’s drive signatures and performance. Once the enemy started shooting at us, then the Thirties will go full speed behind the fighter launched missiles, decoys, and jammers. It was something we’d never tried. But the sims showed it would be successful. Maybe.

“Well, we have a long wait. I am hungry. What about you?”

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

“Three, two, one, Mark!” Jeff announced. As the timer ticked down to zeroes. “Time to kick it into high gear, Kylie.”

“Affirmative,” I replied. As the weapons officer, I had been a passenger for most of this mission. Now, my job kicked into overdrive, if just for a few minutes.

It felt like it had taken days, not the six hours it really was. Along with the Mark Thirties, all the squadrons ignited their drives and went to rapid fire on all their magazines. Both the *Razors* and *Stilettos* have four inboard magazines and separate launchers which gives each fighter a four missile salvo. Their launchers can cycle faster than shipboard launchers, mainly due to their smaller size. The anti-shipping combat pods could launch all twenty missiles at the same time. But the Ops plans had us stagger the launches to be in time with the four missile spreads from the internal launchers. That *should* give the jammers and decoys the best opportunity to help penetrate the enemy defenses.

It took just a few minutes to launch the missiles. We didn’t use every missile in this first wave. We kept fifteen percent in case we needed a follow up barrage. I wasn’t happy about the rest of the plan. We were to follow our missiles inbound, using our countermissiles to protect our missiles from being destroyed by the Vredeen defensive countermissiles. I’d be much happier to hang around as far away as possible. But that meant our countermissiles would not be agile enough to react in a timely manner to the enemy’s actions.

“Squadron datanet is active,” I informed them. “Wing datanet connected. We are now a cog in the machine.”

The datanets give the entire wing cohesive and interlinked fire control for both offensive and defensive fire. But we still maintained the ability to control our own weapons in case the datanet crashed or there was combat damage.

“Looks like the finally see us.” Jeff said.

Their fleet spawned thousands of countermissiles streaking into our fire.  

“Be a bit hard t’miss us, eh?  Tree hunred plus fighters and all our missile drive firing at d’same time? Hoo-wee, dey’d have t’be dead not t’ see dat.”

“Well, they are probably not all dead yet. But that’s not from a lack of trying, Pooch.” Jeff’s light tone didn’t fool me. He was just as bone tired and worried as the rest of us.

“Then we try harder,” I replied. “We have more motivation, for sure.”

“Maybe,” Jeff said. “We have no idea why they attacked. We really have never had an idea of why the have ever attacked us. But his is for damned sure more than the raids they’ve done up until now. Whatever their motivation is, it just might be as powerful as ours to defend.”

Since we’d never seen a living Vredeen, much less ever had direct communications with them, any guess is just as good as another. It was bad logic to assume xenos think like we do. Because most of them don’t. Alien logic is… alien.

“Flight time for our missiles is fifty minutes. We’ve dialed back their speeds to give our countermissiles a better chance of taking out their countermissiles.”

“Counter-countermissiles,” Jeff said. “God, that’s a mouthful. Just be sure to keep enough countermissiles to defend our trip back home. Looks like we got some incoming fire. I honestly thought they’d wait for us to be further in. Kylie, I got the laser clusters. You got the countermissiles.”

The comms chimed with the voice of the CAG, “Alright, folks, you know our mission is to shepherd the missiles and provide cover. We get to follow the missiles in until they go terminal. Commander Balodis has command of the defenses.  The *Linebackers* will activate when the enemy fire is within five light seconds. They should be able to sweep the path and neutralize quite a bit of the incoming fire. We will run a triple stack defense. First and Second squadrons, you get the outer perimeter at fifty million clicks. Third, Fourth, and Fifth squadrons get the second layer at twenty-five million. Third is ten million. Sixth, Seventh. The Joker, your *Razors* get to escort the Mark Thirties. Your whole mission is to keep them whole.”

We’d all heard through the grapevine what had happened to the CAG. As a woman, I know just how much her injuries would affect her, but I have to admire her resolve to keep fighting. I hoped I would do the same.

“*Joker*,” Balodis called over the comms channel, “your omni-links and the Savant system give you an advantage the rest of us just don’t have. We have the rest. Got it?”

The Mark Thirties clustered together inside the shell of our fighter launched missiles. Their drives had been stepped down to mimic the Mark One-fifteens. We wanted them to blend into the rest and sneak into range where their larger drives would kick them into a much higher acceleration. We get them close enough, then they can slam into the enemy’s ships faster than the bastards can react.

“Affirmative,” Jeff answered. “Consider them babysat.”

Jeff’s promotion to Junior Lieutenant might get denied by Navy Command. His promotion to Senior Lieutenant was definitely temporary. Temporary spot promotions to replace combat losses was an ancient naval tradition, but Jeff thinks that his father’s rank and the fact that he is the system’s commanding officer will cause the Navy to bust him back to ensign.

But he’d done a good job as squadron leader. Better than most people who’d been in fighter ops for years. I guess growing up around pilots, even being their mascot at White Gulf Station, was an effective way to forge him into a sharp weapon. He did things by instinct that most people took years to learn. And often that learning was the result of painful failures.

The *Stilettos* mount the older M12G6 countermissile pods, while the *Razors* are equipped with newer designed M28D countermissile pods. They had forty-five percent more countermissiles with two more launchers and twenty close in defense laser clusters. With the Savant system to back us up, it made us the best option for escorting the Mark Thirties. Though, it is really us that backs up the Savants.

We only have fifteen *Razors* left. Just enough to make half a squadron. Our five flights of three fighters can definitely carry their weight, though. I’d crunched the numbers, and our depleted squadron of *Razors* are forty-eight percent more effective on defense than a full squadron of *Stilettos*. That is an impressive number. But on offense, we are fifty-four percent better. If we had a full wing of *Razors*? We’d be damned near unbeatable.

“Squadron orders,” Jeff announced. “*Bulldog*, your flight gets the twelve o’clock positions. *Raptor* at three, *Dozer* at six, and *Slingshot* gets the nine. *Joker* gets the center. We’re going to tuck in tight behind them. Let’s take it to them, folks.”

The wing drove in behind the big missiles. The enemy did their best to defend against our incoming fire. But that defensive fire missed most of the Mark Thirties because we provided the cover for them. The enemy hit a grand total of fifty-eight of the three hundred and ten missiles before we ran out of countermissiles.  

“That’s it. The squadron is Winchester, Jeff. We shot ourselves dry.”

“Then we tuck in closer and use the laser clusters,” Jeff replied. “We need to get these big bastards in closer before we kick their drives into high gear. Then, we might get to do a couple of gun runs.”

The *Linebackers* had done their job as advertised, and we’d only used fifty of them. The drone ships were larger than fighters, but smaller than a corvette. The mounted two fusion plants and three destroyer class fast resetting shield generators. If one goes down, the next is ready to go. Then the automated repair systems would reset the one that went down and repaired any damage it could. That meant they could handle much more incoming fire than we could. But they had their limits. The closer they got to the enemy ships, the better the defensive fire became, leading to *Linebacker* losses.

 “You want to get in close and use the lasers?” I asked.

“The ops plan gives us that option. Depends on the damage we do with the missiles and how many fighters we have left.”

“I do t’ink dat be a bad idea,” Pooch added. “Like pokin’ a bear wit a itty-bitty stick.”

“That’s the mission, Pooch. The ancient Roman gladiators had a saying, ‘Morituri te salutant. We who are about to die salute you.’ The mission comes first. We don’t have to survive. That said, I intend to do everything I can to survive.”

“The Spartans said, ‘Come back carrying your shield, or on it.’ Or something like that,” I added.

“Percute difficile et ieiunium…” Jeff said softly. The fighter corps motto, ‘Strike hard and fast.’ “It doesn’t say we have to survive. That’s why we get all the glory.”

“I can do wid’out the glory, eh,” Pooch groused. “You gots someone at home waitin’ on ya. I still need to tell my true love dat she be my true love. I gots lots o’livin to do yet.”

“Me too, buddy. Me too. Kylie, I have an idea that I’ve been working on. Take a look at it.” Jeff said as he threw a simulation onto my holoscreen.

“What’s this?”

“I did a research paper back at the Academy. I thought that we could mimic the swarm behavior in prey animals. It is universal behavior. Every planet we’ve visited has animals that have evolved some version of it.”

“Convergent evolution,” I replied. “I’ve heard of it.”

“Yeah. It has been well documented. I am hardly the first person to do it, but as an exercise in math and programming, I created an algorithm to mimic a swarm of birds. I modeled it after starlings avoiding a predator. But even fish schools react the same way.

“Swarm behavior can be simply modeled using three simple rules. First an individual unit moves in generally the same direction as their neighbors. Second, they remain close to their neighbors and third, avoid collisions with those neighbors. Modify that model using concentric zones for alignment, attraction and repulsion, then the algorithm will allow one *Razor* to lead an unlimited number of other fighters.”

“Or missiles.”

“Especially missiles,” Jeff agreed. “Missiles would be able to use it even more effectively, because the larger the swarm, the more effective their misdirection and confusion. I’d just have to factor in how to most effectively use decoys and, jammers. Then tweak it for reacting to enemy defensive behavior. But I am a pilot, not a weapons officer… or programmer.”

“You be too modest, my frien’. I am a programmer, and dat do be good code.” At first, I was surprised that Jeff sent the file to Pooch, too. Then I realized that Jeff wouldn’t have not sent it. He is the leader of our squadron and our ship. But he was part of that team and had been completely transparent with us since he’d been aboard. It was his style of leadership.

“There’s no way you could have checked all that code that quickly.”

“Nah. But I gots a nice program dat scan fo’ errors coding real quick like. Then it checks fo’ logic errors, dead ends, logic traps, functions, and common best practices. I learnt it from an old Master Chief Petty Officer on my first deployment. Master Chief Hyung was t’best programmer I ever met. We do be lucky he on the side of angels. ‘Cause if he wasn’t, he’d probably take over the underworld. Last I heard, he was teaching it at some fancy university.”

“I’m glad I have your approval. If you two can see anywhere to improve it, let me know. My pride can handle it. And make it quick, I am taking us in.”

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

“Skipper, what the hell are they doing?” I heard my weapons officer, Senior Lieutenant Micha Nicholson, ask.

“Hellifino. I’m just the Wing Commander. Why should I know what one of my squadrons is doing? I mean, why would anyone tell me anything?”

“Reminds me of birds back on Terra. We used to watch them at dusk when I was at the Academy,” my ship’s engineer, Junior Lieutenant Vina Millisdóttir, say.

“I’ve never seen anyone fly like that. But I don’t want to distract them. The *Razor* squadron has been kind of a wild card from day one. I’ll let them do them and we stick with the rest.”

The Razors and the Mark Thirties spun and danced through space while the decoys and jammers randomly activated. Since they were tied to our datanet, I could see everything, but the enemy would just see a hash of static and multiple decoy drive signatures that appeared and vanished with no discernable pattern.

The short squadron followed the big missiles when they went to max accel. I queried their ammunition levels, and saw they had no missiles or countermissiles left. All they had were their defensive laser clusters and particle cannons. It took guts to defend against the enemy fire with just energy weapons. They may be light speed, but they have short legs. Missiles can strike light hours away. Energy weapons are limited to just scant light seconds, but the missiles are not lightspeed. Which makes getting a good lock is likely, at least if you can defeat the enemy’s ECM.

“Look at those bastards go!” Millisdóttir’s excitement was palpable. “Er, sorry. Look at them go!”

“Yeah, look at those bastards go,” I replied. “Micha, are we getting a good recording of their data logs? If not, let’s get a priority on that. We need to make sure we get a full download on whatever it is they are doing. The eggheads back in R&D is going to drool over this.”

We watched as the *Razors* danced with death. The incoming enemy missiles were a mix of countermissiles and larger missiles that are more effective against fighters. The Vredeen used a different design philosophy than we do. Our missiles are incredibly accurate and can direct their antimatter explosions with gravitic lensing. We can focus the entire warhead against a single discreet point. Their missiles use ten smaller independently targeted nuclear pumped laser warheads in more of a buckshot technique. It may give them a higher hit probability, but they are much weaker and take multiple hits to take down our shields. 

“Let’s see if we can give them some help. Gamma formation.” I set squadron orders for the rest of the wing to split into three prongs and driving forward under maximum acceleration. “Set up a ripple fire by squadron of all remaining missiles… and we are following them in. If they can get in to do gun runs, so can we. One pass. Then head out system for the rendezvous.”

Out beyond the orbit of the twelfth planet, the *Foxhound*, with two the escort carriers *Denali*, and *Bayern* would drop out of hyper to recover our fighters. Hopefully, all of our fighters. But realistically, we would probably lose some on the gun runs. I hate it. I hate the clinically dispassionate term ‘acceptable losses,’ because I hate to lose any of my people. But it happens. I will deal with the trauma later.

If I survive.

The wing did not maneuver anywhere near as gracefully as the *Razors*. *Stilettos* are capable, but they were nowhere near as cutting edge as the *Razors* with the Savant system. But the complete squadrons did give us better defensive fire just due to volume.

The wing blew through the enemy formations. The Mark Thirties and the Razors took out two battleships and damaged three more before they went in for their gun run. Instead of going for the damaged battleships, they went after a couple of heavy cruisers. One was completely destroyed. From what I could tell, they hit a fusion core, and it broke the enemy ship in half.  The second was left a battered, air streaming wreck. Then they turned for another run at the battleships.

That was a mistake. A rookie move that a more experienced squadron commander would not make.   Of the fifteen Razors, only three made it through unscathed. Five were destroyed outright. They did destroy one of the damaged battleships, and that tradeoff was considered and acceptable exchange rate. Losing fifteen personnel and five fighters in return for taking out a battleship would make any admiral happy. But that battleship was already damaged and could easily be taken out by missiles later, from long range.

The Joker was one of the destroyed fighters. My miracle midshipman turned lieutenant was gone."
"The Farlands Campaign, Part 14",HFY,1efjogr,2024-07-29 23:46:00,2,0.75,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1efjogr/the_farlands_campaign_part_14/,pracksack,OC,"I was escorted into another section of the impressive human temple. Henri and Mademoiselle Geneviève were told to wait for the process of my ""confirmación"" to conclude before we could reconvene. As we entered twin wooden doors, which were dark and rectangular with large iron rings built into them, I was met with an oddly intimidating scenery. In seemingly every area of the room, against the walls or in one of the many chairs lined up in rows, a human could be seen. At the far end of the room, there was an incredible table, many times larger than any I had seen. Sitting behind it was an assembly of humans adorned in black, white, and red garments. Some had large red hats with broad brims, and adorning their necks was a magnificent golden accessory. Others had black uniforms similar to Padre de León's priestly attire. One person sat at the center of the assembly.

Although shorter than those around him, he seemed to exude an incredible sense of power. This may have been due to the dreadful expression written across the human's face. An anger was sewn so deeply into his features that I thought perhaps revealing myself before him would most certainly send him into a fit of hysteria. Simultaneously, he seemed focused and undeterred to act according to whatever the human clerics considered protocol as his eyes drifted slowly and calculatedly across the room.

As for his garments, he wore a purple sash, which was cinched tightly around his waist. Over this, he wore a white undergarment that was visible from beneath his large black outer garment. The garment, at the cuffs, was decorated with intricate lace trimmings, which gave him an air of refinement. Atop his head was an odd hat, black with several fins rising out from the top. Alongside them was a strange spherical tuft of what I thought was fur. I could also see that draped around his neck was another bisecting symbol, which seemed to be a recurring icon for this specific order of temples. Despite the intensity in his expression, his clothing was without wrinkles or visible specks. If I hadn't been told otherwise, I would have thought he was a military officer or a substantial political figure rather than the administrator belonging to a religious system.

The discordant conversations amongst the humans in that chamber immediately fell silent as we entered. Captain Pedro and Lieutenant Lanzo were quick to join the other humans who were sitting against the wall. Padre de León followed closely beside me as I walked, the large cloth still draped around me to hide some of my features. I could see several humans sneer at the sight of me, while others turned to say something to the person next to them. We stopped a few paces away from the long wooden table, with our backs towards the other humans sitting in rows.

""En el nombre del Padre, y del Hijo y del Espíritu Santo, I acknowledge the request of... *Jutta*, who comes before us today seeking his confirmación as un caso de necesidad inmediata. Que el Espíritu Santo guide us and grant wisdom as we proceed with this tribunal. Let us begin with a prayer.""

At once, every human in the chamber who wasn't already standing shot up from their seats in unison. The same short human began saying something in his native tongue with his eyes closed. I turned to see that every human also stood with their eyes closed, so I decided to replicate the gesture with my head towards the ground. After a few moments, I could hear the humans shuffle back to their seats and decided to open my eyes again.

He then said, ""May the Advocate, Padre Raimundo de León, please present the subject and his case accordingly?""

Padre de León then stepped forward and said, ""The man who stands beside me today is the one you have indeed heard. He has been called un monstruo, un demonio, e incluso una persona deforme. All of these are completely wrong, as I have come to learn that Jutta desires to serve España y su gente. He has already been admitted by el Capitán General; however, to truly be Spanish, he must also be proven un Católico. I believe this is possible not only because of his convictions, but also because I believe this is un caso de necesidad inmediata!""

The members of the crowd behind us began to murmur among themselves. The group of men before me, who sat behind the long table, also began conversing in whispers. They continued their deliberation before returning to silence.

The Clerical Administrator then said, ""Padre de León, I do not doubt that within your heart, full of grace and willingness to serve la Iglesia Católica, you can be sure this... *criatura* can be so passively trusted? Surely, he has ulterior motives?""

Padre de León replied, ""Both Capitán Pedro António Domínguez de Santa Cruz and Teniente Esteban Adrián Lanzo, who have fought los Británicos alongside him, can affirm that he only wishes to help his people by uniting them to España.""

The Clerical Administrator replied, ""While I retain no authority to question the legitimacy of their account, nor the decision of el Capitán General, I retain all authority on the matter of derecho canónico. We have retained all edicts, all doctrines, and all councils with utmost inflexibility. As to waver in one way will only risk controversy the likes of el Gran Cisma de Occidente. I have been informed that there is likely nothing in el derecho canónico regarding neither the inclusion nor the exclusion of no-humanos. However, we can exclude on the basis of intención y disposición adecuadas. Furthermore, and you may have likely considered as well, that in order for one to profess la fe Católica, he must comprender la fe Católica.""

Padre de León replied, ""Sí, lo he considerado. This is why we declare this un caso de necesidad inmediata. We cannot prove that Jutta understands la fe Católica. However, we do know his intentions are righteous and he is truly in danger.""

The Clerical Administrator returned sharply, ""This is our third objection. He would only be in danger if la Armada intended to send him to battle in the immediate moment. We know this to be false as los Británicos are not at war with us currently. I fear that bautizar y confirmar Jutta would mean these soldados intend to start war with los Británicos. This we also cannot have.""

The crowd again began to murmur. Several members sat behind the long tables crossed their arms and nodded, as if to agree with the plump human's objections.

Padre de León inquired, ""We have considered that he may lack the correct intent, disposition, and understanding. However, I would like to call to attention that in spite of this, there have been exceptions. Constantino el Grande, que una vez fue pagano, became a Christian despite his prior propensities. While Jutta is not like Constantino, he warns of his people who we know have invaded Jamaica. If they see los Británicos as enemigos, they will likely see us the same. It has been a month and three weeks since the last report, and we hear that Los Hejadianos have already taken Falmouth.""

The humans in the chamber were sent into a nervous racket of energetic discussion. Some were visibly angry, others skeptically shaking their heads, while others began rubbing their chins inquisitively.

A human dressed in red, sitting next to the Administrator inquired, ""So then la confirmación of Jutta would be to our benefit if the Hejadianos decide to attack Cuba? However, it would be to our detriment if los Británicos defeat them. As Su Excelencia has mentioned, we hold no authority to impede or criticize the decisions of los militares. However, our concern does include ensuring that the assembly does not offend derecho canónico. If we believe our decisions would inadvertently cause a war as well, we would be tanto más culpable. Would you have us make our decision according to a wager of possible invasion? ¡No tiene sentido!""

Another human, dressed in similar red garments, sitting farthest from the Administrator added, ""War is a horrible thing indeed. However, our primary duty is to serve God and His people. I am called to lead and guide las ovejas, to administer los sacramentos, and to provide guía espiritual when it may be required of me. It is a great responsibility and honor to be a servant of God and to deliver la declaración de amor y salvación. Why would I dare to stop doing so here? ¿No lo ves? Dios has given him a mouth for speaking, and legs for walking. This means he has a soul to speak for, and maybe God, y no el Diablo, tells his legs where to go? Este no es un demonio, no es un hombre maldito, he is just escamosa. This means he is well within his right to seek salvation, for truly we were once just like him.""

A man from the crowd then shot up and shouted, ""Just like him!? JUST LIKE HIM!? I cannot believe how many of you have been deceived! ¡Tontos, todos ustedes deben estar bajo un hechizo! He is un DEMONIO!""

With that, many humans became lively, throwing accusations and assumptions about; paranoia seeping into every word they said. The Cerical Administrator stood and shouted. His resonant tone filled the air with a domineering aura, and the chamber was instantly reduced to a cold stillness.

The Clerical Administrator then turned to me, ""Su Eminencia, el Cardenal Lombardi, says you have a mouth to speak with. Señor Jutta, I request that you prove whether you and your companions intend to go to war.""

I felt every eye within the chamber fall upon me. Something about the inflection in the Administrator's voice conjured within me a deep sense of uncertainty. Why did they want to know this? They had just expressed their desire against it? Perhaps this was a ploy to have me speak ill of the British. By insulting their still human opponents, they'd likely look for any excuse to have a reason to dislike me. Then I recalled all the things Padre de León said to me, that night I wept in his arms.

I removed the large cloth from my head and said, ""I am here, seeking admission into every institution required of me, like a human, in order to achieve an alliance for my people with the Spanish. This means we intend to go to war against the British, which may be unfortunate news for everyone here. However, that is not truly why I am willingly submitting myself to be inducted into this... church. Because there is a larger battle occurring within me. In this moment, I may not fully understand how your religion works. However, if it means I can find answers, not only in regards to the unifying of our people, but also for ending this internal conflict, I am more than willing to change. I only hope this can happen before I find myself in the midst of battle again.""

The humans sitting behind the long table seemed surprised with my statement. They looked to one another for a few moments and deliberated again with whispers.

The human in red garments, who seems to think well of me, said, ""This is what I mean. He does not come to receive favor amongst his companions. He may not understand everything, but he understands that he can attain the greatest gift! Recuerda el Evangelio de Mateo, en el capítulo sexto, y el versículo treinta y tres. I do not believe any of you would DARE to keep from him what God has also given you! Ten piedad, ten caridad.""

The same man from the crowd, who shouted before, shouted again, ""You think God would give him mercy!? Ask him if his ugly amigos bastardos showed mercy to the people in Bahía de Montego! If you admit him, he will bring hell upon this whole island! We should KILL HIM, NOT GIVE HIM OUR BLESSING!""

The man then walked from his chair alongside several others, and they made their way towards Padre de León and I. However, before they could attack me, Lanzo ran from his place against the wall and grabbed hold of one of the men who approached me.

He roared, ""Si atacas a mi amigo, I will strike your face until you cannot breath!""

Several others ran from their seats to take Lanzo off of the man he was antagonizing. The men who approached me diverted their attention to the near brawl that seemed to be developing.

Before the situation could worsen, the Clerical Administrator stood again and shouted, ""¡Basta de tonterías infantiles! If any one person, including Jutta, is struck, the offender will be the next on trial! ¡Vuelvan a sus asientos!""

The crowd dispersed, albeit hesitantly.

The administator turned to me and said, ""¿Ves? Now, Padre de León, por eso no podemos convertirlo. If the news of his confirmación became public we would have chaos unvelop before our very eyes. While I do indeed consider the possibility in the future I cannot make such a judgment in your favor while his people are still so unfamilair. Furthermore, even after his own account, I have not been convinced that he is in the danger you claim he is in. As such, this would mean his case is not one of necesidad inmediata. Debes entenderlo.""

Padre de León sighed, as if to admit defeat after having heard the Administrator's conclusion. That was when I heard from the large wooden doors a series of knocks. As everyone turned their attention towards the doors, they suddenly swung open forcefully. From the door, several more men, clad in clerical garments came pouring in. However, something about their garments was not only obviously different, but surprisingly fearsome even when standing near to those in the human military.

The most intricately dressed of them walked at the front of the approaching entourage. His knee high boots clicked against the stone floor, the golden buckles on them glistening in the sunlight that poured in from the windows. His black pants, which were tucked beneath a red belt sash, had gold trimming around the cuffs similar to that of his jacket. The incredible coat, which nearly dragged across the floor, was adorned with a large badge on his chest. The silver star, likely the size of my whole paw, had within it an icon. A similar bisecting 'T' with four other, smaller intersections erupting from the center and stretching outwards alongside the other arms of the shape. Behind him flowed a large red cape, which was secured to his shoulders similarly to how the mantle of my old uniform was; shield-like badges were clipped to his coat's lapels. Atop his head was an ornate black, gold, and red hat. Similar in structure to the broad brimmed hats atop the heads of the red clad clerics. However, this hat had a large feather sticking out from the band around the crown.

I also noticed that the man had a belt tied over the sash at his waist. Sticking out from beneath the coat was a large sword, several times longer than even Lanzo's impressive blade. The imposing human, with a red colored tuft of fur that grew from beneath his nose and chin, had several others following him. These men, while not as elegant and foreboding as him, were dressed similarly to Captain Pedro and I. Having acquired a personal sense for both fashion and refinement. They had on their chests a similar, albeit smaller version, of the badge worn by the caped figure. He marched beside Padre de León and I, under his arms he carried an impressive roll of paper, which he subsequently unfurled.

He stamped his feet to the cold ground before shouting, ""By order of the Chapter Commander, His Excellency Giovanni Rossi, of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition. This he Declares: We have been informed of the whereabouts and activities of the subject of our intrigue, Jutta Aloreth. His Eminence and all other relevant authorities require his immediate relocation to a more secure position under the custody of those who petition his presence. This is in accordance with the laws and regulations set forth by the Holy Office. May the grace of God guide our actions and bring about the salvation of our souls.""

The man then closed the scroll and handed it off to one of the men in his company. He then approached those sat behind the long table and handed the Clerical Administrator a sealed envelope. The men beside him peered over the short human's shoulders to read the contents of the parchment. Their expressions of determination soon became uncertain, and they again began discussing amongst one another.

The man in red named 'Lombardi', exclaimed, ""This is a most unforeseen development. I am afraid this means this tribunal must be, and as soon as possible, adjourned so as not to interfere with the Holy Inquisition.""

One man from the crowd cried, ""What is the meaning of this? What interest does the inquisition have with the lagarto?""

The caped man retorted, ""The interests of the Holy Inquisition only concern those for whom the office has granted the access of knowing. That would include only those assembled at this table, as well as Father of Leon, Captain Pedro António Domínguez de Santa Cruz and Lieutenant Esteban Adrián Lanzo. It would then be required of the rest of you to vacate this chamber at once!""

The Clerical Administrator rose from his seat, ""What he says is true. Unless you would wish to incur the charge of obstrucción a la justicia, I implore those who know they are of no right to be here to leave as this man has requested. By the authority relegated to me, como Obispo de la Santa Iglesia Católica, and in accordance with the laws of the Church, I hereby adjourn this tribunal.""

At once, the crowd of humans that had gathered in the chamber began to hastily evacuate. The once congested room appeared far larger than it had before. Now, only the council of men behind the long table, the mysterious entourage, and three of my friends remained.

""I apologize for having undone such a fine congregation,"" the man said with a bow. ""I am Sir Reginald Ambrose Montague. As per the contents of that letter, you would know that the nature of my emergence is urgent. Now, correct me if my intuition does fail, but was this convention to do with the confirmation of Jutta?

The Clerical Administrator replied, ""Indeed it was. However, I must inquire before I am to consign him to your custody, pero ¿cuál es exactamente su asunto con él?""

Sir Reginald replied, ""We have received information from several members of the office, whose names I am not at liberty to disclose, that Jutta's life will likely be at risk for the following week should he remain here in Havana. The information was unclear as to who or what may possibly try to harm him, but what we do know is that we require that he remains alive.""

Lombardi then exclaimed, ""This is most unfortunate to hear. However, and against all possible expectations, the very reason for why we convened here to begin with has now been proven legitimate! Even if the tribunal has been officially adjourned, aún conservo todas las autoridades otorgadas al Cardenal. May I make an appeal so as to fulfill my duties as they relate to Jutta?""

Sir Reginald looked to the men besides him, and after whispering for a few moments, he replied, ""While my superiors do state explicitly their wish for him to be transferred to my custody, I am of no rank to obstruct the duties of a Cardinal.""

Lombardi rose from his seat with excitement, ""Dios está con nosotros! Un verdadero milagro, that the tribunal shall be adjourned and el caso de necesidad inmediata be affirmed! Quickly, preparemos las aguas!""

\*\*\*

I was suddenly escorted out from the chamber and into the main portion of the human temple. I was told to make my way towards a stone pedestal that seemed to have some sort of basin built into it. Lombardi and several others stood close by it, including Padre de León. I was then instructed to stand before the basin which I then could see was full of water.

The red clothed human then said, ""Jutta, do you desire to be baptized in la fe Católica and to live your life as a follower of Jesucristo?""

While I didn't understand the exact proceeds of this religious ceremony, no what any of the terms said mean, I knew that I must omit my bewilderment if I still intended to ensure that the humans would favor me. I reminded myself that, no matter the inclinations of doubt that coursed in my mind, that this was necessary for the success of my people's conquest of this world. However, something else crossed my mind. I never once thought to object to the ceremony. I didn't feel as if partaking in such a tradition would make me some sort of traitor, as becoming a member of the human military already earned me such a title. I also did not believe going along with this process meant I was abandoning Unacrastism in any capacity.

While the humans were indeed different in nearly every way possible, something about satisfying their religious proceeds only conjured figments of Mademoiselle Geneviève in my mind. Over and over again, at the enunciation of every word, her blue eyes glinted in the sunlight and her reassuring smile silenced any possible reason to hesitate my mind could produce. It was as if her presence had the power to transcend any cultural or societal barriers, but what gave her such an ability continued to remain unknown to me. Whatever it was, it ignited a fire within me, a deep and unshakable desire to go about the world and doing all that was required of me and more. In a strange realm, full of uncertainty and all manner of danger, none of it mattered as these figments continued to dwell even to the deepest recesses of my logical mind.

Lombardi had only just finished asking me the question, to which I, without even flinching said, ""Yes! Whatever is required of me, I will do it boldly!""

The enthusiasm I spoke with suprised even me. The humans surrounding the basin looked at each other with dismay combined with happiness and proceeded with the ceremony.

The red-clad cleric then said, ""Yo os bautizo en el nombre del Padre, del Hijo y del Espíritu Santo.""

As he said this, he took a large silver leaf shaped impliment. He then took some water from the basin and lifted it over my head before subsequently pouring the cold liquid over my head. The sudden chill that was sent down my spine due to the water's frigidness caused me to shiver and my feathers to fluff up. From behind me I could hear Geneviève clapping and laughing gleefully. I turned to her and my gaze met with her. I could feel my entire face become warm, and for whatever reason, a sense of embarassment also washed over me, which drove me to quickly turn away. As if seeing her put an unbearable weight upon me that I could only bear for a few moments. Padre de León then placed his paw on my shoulder and gesture for me to move towards the far end of the temple.

I was instructed to follow the clerics just slightly before a large table which had on it a glistening silver chalice and a large loaf of bread in a wooden bowl.

Lombardi then said. ""Tomad y comed todos de él, porque esto es mi cuerpo, que será entregado por vosotros.""

After having said these words, he knelt before the table and took the loaf of bread with both of his paws. He then raised it above his head, towards the large suspended icon of the deceased human adorned with gold. He then placed the bread back into the wooden bowl before moving to hover slightly over the silver chalice.

He said, ""Tomad todos de él y bebed, porque éste es el cáliz de mi sangre, la sangre de la alianza nueva y eterna, que será derramada por vosotros y por muchos para el perdón de los pecados. Haced esto en memoria mía.""

He then did to the chalice what he did to the loaf of bread. Kneeling before the table and then taking the cup's base with both of his paws before lifting it slowly over his head and carefully placing it back onto the table. He then raised his paw to hover slightly over the two sustenances. He then pointed outwards with two digits and waved his paw over each of the items. I was then instructed to approach the human in red and kneel no less than a half pace away from Lombardi.

He then outstreched his paw towards me and left it to hover just shy of the base of my horns.

He then said, ""Que Dios protect you as you embark on your journey into our world, which I do not doubt has caused you much trouble already.""

I was then instructed to open my mouth and allow for Lombardi to place a peace of bread into my mouth. I chewed the small peace of food that was given to me. After that I was again instructed to remain kneeling, and soon, Lombardi took the silver chalice and requested that I drink from it. He poured the cup slightly to allow for a small amount of the liquid inside to enter my mouth. I was instantly shocked to taste the familiar bittersweetness of wine and somewhat dissapointed at how little I was given to drink.

Lombardi then took my paw and guided me to stand before him.

He then said, ""Jutta, this will be the final step in your becoming reconciled to our Nuestro Señor Jesucristo. Do you intend to be confirmed into la fe Católica and continue your journey as a follower of Jesucristo from here on?""

I replied simply, ""Yes.""

Then Lombardi turned around towards the table behind him. There, besides the wine and the bread, was a small bowl full of a slightly yellow and translucent liquid. He held the bowl in one paw and with the other dipped two digits into the liquid. He then took the liquid and smeared it onto my forehead.

He then said, ""Be sealed with the gift of the el Espíritu Santo.""

After this, he placed a paw onto my shoulter, and nwith closed eyes, said, ""Señor, te pedimos que el Espíritu Santo descienda sobre él y le conceda los dones de sabiduría, entendimiento, consejo, fortaleza, ciencia, piedad y temor de ti. Te lo pedimos por Cristo nuestro Señor. Amén.""

Another human cleric, much younger than Lombardi then approached me with a parchment in his paws. He handed it to me and, from what I could tell, it was a script that the humans most likely would require that I recite. While strange at first, it would make sense that such a complex religious enrolment ceremony would also entail some words from the initiate.

With the script in my paws, I began to read, ""I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and... *earth?* ~~that's the name of this realm?~~ and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, who suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified and... *died*...

I paused for a moment, realizing that perhaps I forgot how humans were. I had so foolishy assumed, on the basis of appearances, as with their temple, clerics, and artwork, that their religion would perhaps be devoid of the human savagery I still so vividly remember. My eyes then slowly trailed upwards, towards the figment of the human who I, in that moment, understood to be their diety. Blood seepeding from where his paws and feet had been impaled, a large gash across his side, and his face bearing an expression of sorrow. I slolwy resumed reading the script, thinking that maybe I should have hesitated to go along with this ceremony.

""...and was buried; he descended into hell; and on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right '*hand'* of God the Father; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.""

This final section of the script, while it did explain their religion a bit to me, it did not pacify the sensation of dread within me. It seemed to me that the humans worshipped a man-God who was killed and somehow resurrected. While immortality was a quality attributed to most figures in theistic religions, none of them would attain such a characteristic by reversing death. Rather, most gods, such as the Tichat god of strength '*Trall'katla*', he is said to simply be unkillable. Perhaps there was a reason the human deity had to die. Whatever it was, I didn't know it. And even if it were explained to me, I doubt I would understand it.

My contemplation of the abnormally brutal human spiritual system was suddenly interrupted, as Lombardi said, ""Que Dios le bendiga and guide you on your journey en la fe, and may he be with you always. Protecting you from hardship and teaching you to thank him always. Amen. Now I send you with a sign of peace, dear Jutta.""

After he said this, the old human wrapped his arms around me and pulled me into his friendly embrace. A species who believes their God was mercilessly slaughtered for some reason, and they treat a creature as unfamiliar as I with the same affection they would give to their own friends...

*...curse these terrifying creatures! Ruthless and bloodthirsty beasts in one moment, and in the next, gentle caretakers and even friends!*

1st month A, 280 AC

_Back at last. More than a year in winter chasing after nothing and no one. Almost lost a toe. Fucking waste._

Bennifer couldn't believe it was the same Kingsroad they had taken when first his family moved from Harrenhal to Milkwood Meadow. Winter made its presence felt in every way possible, and even in sunlight, it seemed that White Walkers would come traipsing down like the tales said. The barren trees with their jagged edges, the dour, sullen sky that the sun rarely shone in, all made for dull marching even as game was scarce and there were no fruits or edible leaves to compensate. Bennifer had to place one man permanently looking down jabbing at the snow with a stick to ensure they did not stray from the road - it was hard to tell through the thick snow what was paved road and what wasn't, and when solid floor gave way to slippery ice. There was no rage to the season, but there certainly was power. The Trident and the Green Fork were completely frozen over and thus a great force had been extinguished. It felt strange to not hear the roaring sound of their flow, to not feel their humidity. 

Milkwood Meadow was not a known location - in fact, it wasn't a location at all until scarcely three years ago - so there was no development of towns to look out for - just an inn with a cow-shaped sign somewhere between the third and fourth fords on the Green Fork. The fords, of course, were impossible to find, and they would've almost missed the inn in the snowstorm had it not cleared just before reaching it. Before going in, Bennifer turned to his men. 

""Let no one say this campaign was futile - not for us, anyway. Keeping the peace in King's Landing in a time of upheaval with the Gold Cloaks is no small task. But more importantly, we stood fast, arm-in-arm with the forces of the Riverlands - nay, the entire realm! Just two years ago, you all were nobody. Mere peasants in some distant fief of Walder Frey. Now you are knights serving with honour, bearing the great name of Butterwell and showing yourself as the hard, honourable and loyal men that you are - that you always were! I say that is farther from futile than this campaign could ever have been!""

A cheer went up from the party, weary faces suddenly awakened and at the ready. All of them were young men hand picked by Bennifer and his uncle, trained in the open fields while the new keep was being built - all of them save for old Erreg, Bennifer's good friend from the village who had been one of the very few knights to accompany him from the start. Whatever else he was, Bennifer had a well-established way of bonding with those under him while also drilling them to the best of their ability - a delicate balance of efficiency and morale that came first from setting the example himself. The entire period of the campaign, he took care to always march at the head, always maintain discipline, never crib or complain except at Sevenstreams - and even then, he had formally raised the issue to Ser Brynden advocating for them. ""All the meat and ale in this here inn shall be exhausted today - this is the reward you brave buffoons deserve!"" he declared as he kicked the doors open.

---

""Snowed in? Seven hells."" Bennifer's voice took on a higher pitched, more incredulous tone whenever he was in his cups. ""Aye, Ser Bennifer, the gate's completely stoppered on both sides after this damn storm, it's even filled the moat,"" The barman spoke in a singsong that matched the bobbling of his head as filled up more flagons of ale. ""Some of us are gonna go there wi' shovels at firs' light, bu' it's lookin' like a good two days' work wi' still more snow in the night - it's only Ser Alston tha's stuck inside, and 'nuff food to last him a month. I- I hope tha's alrigh' wit'cha, Ser, he's a hardy ol' chap, good Ser Alston is."" Bennifer nodded with such force that it made his head spin for a moment, grabbing his friend Erreg's arm to steady himself. 

""And do you think..."" Erreg said to the barman in his slow drawl, rubbing the hilt of his sword, ""that Ser Alston has done a better job of looking after the people? Do you not miss our Ser Bennifer here?"" The barman, inexperienced with unruliness, gulped audibly - there had not been an inn in these parts until the Butterwells came along. ""O- of course I miss o-our young knight. We love him, truly, we all do love you most dearly, Ser!"" The slight, whimpering man sank lower as Bennifer clumsily rose across the table separating them. ""Oh you do, do you?"" he said, his tone still the same. ""Well, your knight justcame back from saving you from invaders and bandits attacking from both north and south!"" ""Yes, real brutes from Lys and Braavos and other godforsaken lands,"" Erreg chimed in, his blade sliding in and out. ""Aye, aye. Just these drinks for free is not enough gratitude shown, is it? I made you this inn, after all, why should I ever pay here?"" ""There never was any question abou' i', Ser! Ne'er a one!"" the barman squeaked. ""So how do you plan to show your knight and his lads the welcome they deserve?""

Bennifer and Erreg were then led, with desperate placations from the barman's wife, up the stairs where room and board for travelers were available... and further down the hall, where muffled noises of mirth and pleasure could be heard above the din of the raucous soldiers and townsfolk below. ""What do we have here..."" Bennifer broke into a giggle. ""When I left, this wasn't there.""

The barman made a signal and four or five scantily clad women emerged from as many rooms, and all started inviting Bennifer inside. A sly smile overtook his annoyance and he began eyeing each of them with their curves or lack thereof. ""I think I should start taking a cut... a quarter of your earnings from this seems more than fair, eh?"" Bennifer took his time to settle one of them while Erreg ran down to fetch the greener among the Butterwell knights. Bennifer waited for him to return and to make the choice for the rest. ""You lot best make me and my men happy,"" he announced giddily, a cross-eyed smirk directed at the hastily escaping barman, his loud voice echoing across the hallway. ""Otherwise the cut will be three-quarterrrrrs!""

---

Bennifer awoke near noon the next day, still in bed, lying with two women, neither of whom were the one he had first chosen, along with Erreg snuggling comfortably in his arms. For a moment, all was serene and calm. He felt as if he could be here forever. That was all shattered by the piercing jolt to his head that brought with it a harsh ringing sound. _My mouth is dryer than the Dornish desert._ He pushed his friend away, disgusted with himself and with the tiny flashes of memory that did come back to him of what transpired in the night. In a daze, he put on smallclothes that did not belong to him and began to search for a pail - to fill with water or to vomit in, whichever came first.

By late afternoon, the nauseating effects of the previous night had subsided, replaced by the ringing of the village coming alive around the inn and a nearby sept. The headache refused to go away, and he found that resuming the ale was the quickest way out of it. There was no getting rid of the bitter taste that would be felt whenever he thought of the morning. 

""There's to be a wedding 'ere,"" the barman explained when Bennifer asked him. ""The girl might be havin' a child in 'er belly, so it has te be now in the winter. We take wha' opportunity fer celebration we get, ye see! Now, there's not to be much fer a feast after las' ni... I mean, las' few nights, an' this whole winter really,"" the poor man rushed to correct himself, now that even Erreg was awake and had found his way downstairs. ""Bu' the village is pitchin' in, aye, it'll be as grand as we can manage wi' wha' we've got!"" A hand was placed on Bennifer's shoulder and he winced when he looked back and saw it was Erreg's, who said, ""Well, you know who the guest of honour is, then."" 

Sundown came and the happy couple - Bennifer found out then that the groom was his own stableboy, Young Jon - covered in snow after dashing from the sept to the inn. In his once-again drunken state, the young knight stopped the girl's father to make the first toast himself. ""Ah, two young souls in love,"" he began, ""such a beautiful sight for sore eyes. Look at them deeply, all who stand here. These are two people taking a stand that they will make for themselves the great, happy life that they deserve.""

He stood up from his seat, looking pointedly at the rest. Once everyone including the bride and groom had risen from their seat, Bennifer continued. ""It is the duty of a Noble to grant couples such as Young Jon and Tara here the security, the peace, the safety to carry out their pledges and endeavours without worrying about anything but their own selves. It helps when townspeople such as you come together and celebrate them, but the ultimate responsibility of their prosperity lies with the Lord... with me. I am honoured to know that I have brought it well and good. I bless your union and wish you a happy life together."" Glasses clinked, salutations were made, but murmurs began to spread across the tables of the inn.

They were confirmed when Erreg, ever by Bennifer's side, raised his own glass to the couple. ""To Jon and Tara, under patronage of _Lord_ Bennifer Butterwell!"" The Knight of Milkwood Meadow turned to his friend, looking at him for the first time since the morning, blushing a rosy red."
"Every full moon, my friends lock me in my room until dawn. I wish I never found out the reason why. (Part 2)",Odd_directions,1e9vadu,2024-07-22 21:21:46,177,0.99,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1e9vadu/every_full_moon_my_friends_lock_me_in_my_room/,Trash_Tia,Horror,"My friends are no longer human. 

And neither am I. 

I thought they were embarrassed by their moon-drunk selves, but no. 

They were playing Silent Hill with my emaciated body. 

The moon's influence has moved past sending them into a trance-like state and acting moon-drunk. This was a whole other level of side effect. One they were trying and failing to hide with smiles and nonchalant faces. And I couldn’t stand it.

I was going to go fucking crazy.

Especially when the three of them were acting like the night before never happened. 

I needed answers.

Why we were replicating—and the numbers carved into mine and Rowan’s necks supposedly marking our copies.

Were Immie and Kaz the same?

I wasn’t going to find them staying in that house. Not in my state of mind, anyway. 

Paranoia had taken over like a virus, like a parasite leeching onto my brain. 

Conversations with them turned into a game of cat and mouse. 

Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to lecture me about leaving the refrigerator door open, and I felt… trapped. Like he was going to lunge at me any second, like he could sense my smell, the taste of fresh flesh on my bones ready for him to tear off. 

He looked normal enough, talking like usual, with a brow raised and the slight curve of a smirk on his lips. 

But I didn’t see intense hunger in his eyes. I didn’t see anything predatory. 

Kaz seemed like himself, like the guy I’d been living with for almost two years. 

And somehow, that made it worse. 

That made them good actors. Rowan and Immie were exactly the same, becoming the perfect mimics of the people I had grown to love. 

It was around midnight when I dragged myself down the stairs, shouldering a backpack with everything I could pack on such short notice. Yanking open the door and stepping over the threshold, I sucked in the cool night air. Before I could step out, however, a chuckle startled me.

Rowan. Standing in his robe, dark brown curls sticking up everywhere, he regarded me with dark eyes—and just for a moment, I wondered if he was going to drop the act.

Out of the three of them, Rowan was the one who struggled most with the façade.

I hadn’t forgotten the look of resentment and hatred he’d given me on the night of the full moon. The real him. Relief flooded me at the thought of him giving in and finally ripping off the mask. Instead, though, he folded his arms across his chest and took a step forward, still with that smile, a smile I knew was a grimace.

Rowan really wasn’t trying to hide his disdain for me.

Instinctively, I took a step back.

And like clockwork, he took another step forward, and another, until I could smell the coffee on his breath.

“It’s almost midnight,” Rowan said. If he noticed my panicked steps back, he didn’t say anything. “Where are you going?”

“The store,” I replied smoothly. “I need some fresh air.”

Rowan cocked his head, his lip curling. “At midnight?”

The door slammed shut in my face, and I resisted the urge to shriek.

“Yeah,” I hissed out. “I’m gonna get some food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him. “Dude, Kaz just made veggie lasagna. Don’t you want that?”

“No,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh.” His lip curled. “So, what are you going to the store for?”

The gleam in his eye was driving me crazy. His whole expression, every contortion in his face, was challenging me to make more excuses.

The conversation was going nowhere, and somehow I could tell he was loving it; he was loving the fact that I was trembling, trying to stay calm, trying to stabilize my body. “Candy,” I said through my teeth. “I’m going to get some candy.”

Rowan hummed, an almost genuine smile pricking. I might have fallen for it if it wasn’t for how close he was standing to me, how he was cornering me. “Sweet. Get me some, would ya? There’s something about those gummy snakes that seriously slap.” He offered his hand for a high five, his gaze flicking to my backpack. He knew.

I knew he knew, and yet he wasn’t saying anything. He was playing with me. 

Rowan’s smile widened. “Hurry back, all right? There are some freaks out there, Nin. We don’t want you getting hurt now, do we?”

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine, and I forced a smile back.

Every instinct inside me told me to run. I had to get out. Away from him. From his coffee breath turning my gut, his erratic movements like he was ready to tear out my throat at any moment. I felt my body moving, my legs starting to work.

One step—and then another. I turned away from him. It took one single breath to reach the door, and another to remember how to grab the handle and twist it.

He was coming after me, I thought, my mind going into overdrive. 

I imagined his footsteps, heavy breath as he wrapped his hand around my arm and yanked me back inside, his teeth grazing the back of my neck. I forced my legs further until I was halfway down the path, reveling in the cool night air grazing my arms. When I pushed open the rickety gate which squealed under pressure, I risked turning back, my heart in my throat. 

In my head, Rowan was a monster bleeding back into the dark.

Turning around to face the house, though, there was nobody there. 

The door was still open, the hallway lit up in all-too-familiar golden light. 

But Rowan was gone. 

When I squinted, I could just about glimpse his figure moving back up the stairs in slow, almost defeated strides.

Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home and the people I saw as family. 

Before I turned and finally catapulted myself into a run. 

It’s not like I could go back to my parents' house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night.

I had a friend from class. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself, only smiling at me in passing. We went from hanging out almost every day to barely talking, and I figured it was just natural for a friendship to crumble, even if I didn’t want it to. Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms.

I could either turn up at his door and make a fool out of myself, or go back to my cannibal roommates. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was.

Sam lived in a large building with ivy crawling up red-brick. The house was old and crumbling, but cozy. I remembered freshman days, sitting under the late glow of the sun, the two of us spread out on a worn picnic blanket watching the July 4th fireworks in the sky. Before I could hesitate, I knocked three times. 

The windows were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting. 

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked made my stomach twist.

Sure, it was midnight. Why *wouldn't* he lock it? 

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognized her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s roomie.

I had grown used to her over-the-top smiles and obsession with mini cacti, but this girl seemed like a different person. 

There was something else. Something I couldn’t put my finger on. The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to miss. Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. 

“Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Why are you barefoot?” She folded her arms. “Don't tell me you've got a weird fetish.”

I stared down at my feet, and she was right. I didn’t even put on shoes. The worst part is I barely felt the rough gravel between my toes and bare soles. I was numb on adrenaline. I shook my head with what I hoped was a smile. “Is Sam in?”

Something flashed across her face, and it was so fast I could barely read it. Poppy was quick to hide it with a smile. “Uhh, he's kind of busy right now.” Her attention went back to my feet. “More importantly, why are you running around with no shoes on?”

Before I could choke some kind of answer, the girl gestured me inside. “Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realize how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him! You know, catch up.”

Poppy laughed. “About? You ran across campus to talk?” Her smile was teasing, and I’d missed it. “Nin, have you heard of texting?”

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah.” She cleared her throat, stepping aside. 

“Well, you know you’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble.” she gestured over her shoulder. “Sammy is in the lounge.” 

Poppy led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table. It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

I nursed the can between my hands, rolling it around. *”Game?”*

Poppy rolled her eyes, yanking open the refrigerator with a little *too much* gusto and pulling out a beer. She cracked it open and took a sip through a  groan. 

“Urgh. They're in the middle of a tournament, or whatever. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress.” Poppy set the can down. “I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open my soda, I downed half of it. God, there was nothing better than a frosty Coke. Rowan and I used down bottles of them for our failed Tik-Tok account. We stopped doing it when he had to get his stomach pumped.

“Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. 

I couldn’t help noticing her attire, and her claim about not being able to sleep suddenly seemed dubious. What, had she been sleeping fully dressed?

Poppy smirked and perched herself on the edge of the table. ""Just a nerd game,"" she said dismissively. ""Sam’s friends are quite… odd.""

I glanced at her jacket, still glistening. ""Have you been outside?""

""Outside?"" Her expression crumpled before she realized what I meant. ""Oh. Oh, yeah. I went for a walk."" She grabbed her beer. ""Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.""

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she spun around and grabbed my arm. ""Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.""

As she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a fleeting glimpse of... something.

I didn’t see much, just enough to know it wasn’t some typical Dungeons and Dragons game.

Papers were strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, was gathered around, one of them marking something on the paper.

Sam’s other housemates were conspicuously absent. When Poppy walked in, dragging me along, the group quickly turned to block my view, hurriedly clearing papers and shutting laptops. 

It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, however, seemed delighted by their reaction. ""Oh, Saaaammmyy,"" she sang, leaning against the door with a smile. ""You have a visitor.""

Sam looked different, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. 

His light sandy hair was tied into its usual clumsy ponytail, but the look on his face was one I’d never seen before. 

Flustered, his cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. 

Like Poppy, he was fully dressed. Sam murmured something to the group, and they quickly gathered stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing the table.

Poppy, now slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. ""And then there were three!” 

She stretched out like a cat and squealed when Sam threw a cushion at her. ""We finally have our house back!""

""You know I have the lounge until two,"" he retorted, continuing to tidy up.

Poppy mimicked his voice, her body melting into the beanbag. *""You know I have the lounge until two.""*

""What did I tell you about mimicking me?"" Sam shot her a glare, exasperated.

The girl chuckled. ""Hey, it’s fun.""

""It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own roommates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. 

That’s how we became close, actually. His amusement at my failure to understand him. Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. 

They all looked to be middle aged to ancient. I glimpsed a woman who looked to be at least 70 stride to the door. “Don’t give me that look.” Poppy said.

“Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite half of the neighborhood.”

“They’re not weird games. We’re saving the town.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

“Maybe.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great.""

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  

By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube videos on low. Poppy had lent me some clothes to sleep in, and I was ready to pass out. Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your roomies got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalise my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me again, and again, and again, and—

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird *how*?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And those roommates…who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

I mean, I couldn’t.

Their names were entangled on my tongue whenever I tried.

Sam asked me the same question every day, and the words tangled in my throat. 

I told him it was a prank gone wrong, and that seemed to appease him.

But his expression never seemed to believe me, forcing a smile and nodding. 

Like a parent reassuring a child everything was going to be okay. 

A week flew by in a confusing blur, and I went to class as usual, staying at Sam’s until I could find a more permanent place. Much to Poppy’s delight, Sam didn’t invite his friends over again. Instead, he insisted on video games and takeout every night.

It was like freshman year again, and I found myself drowning out the thoughts and questions still haunting me with alcohol and drunk games of Risk.

Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction.

I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with “?????” messages. 

I muted it and ignored my phone. There would be a point when I’d go back, I thought. After all, I had to know what was wrong with them, why the moon afflicted that kind of behavior, and just what exactly they had done to me. 

But it wouldn’t be yet. 

I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach.

Class was ending, and as usual, I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam usually met me before we went to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull.

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with the cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. Slumping down on the stairs leading to the main reception, I fought against a cry. The pain was like nothing I’d felt before, like someone had plunged a lead pipe through my brain and stirred my brain into a soupy mess. 

Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. 

“Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

I could practically hear the cogs in his head turning. Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Fifteen.” I rolled my eyes. I meant to say that we should head down the stairs because I was feeling progressively sicker by the second and felt like I was going to faint, the world around me becoming a blur of colors and faint noises I could barely decipher. 

A sudden loud slam, however, pricked my ears. It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. 

To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. 

Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. 

Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my muddled brain. 

I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. The sound of slipping on a rug, or tripping on literal *air.*  There was nobody else it  would be but my chronically clumsy roommate. 

Which meant he was on campus, and I had zero idea how to confront him about the *cannibalism* thing. 

He wasn't what you'd expect a monster to look like—especially not one you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. It was all about perspective. 

To a passerby, he seemed like an ordinary college student, a dishevelled one who had just stumbled headlong into an automatic door, leaving a glaring red bruise in the center of his forehead. 

But to me, Rowan Beck was a monster surrounded by fresh meat. 

The students pushing past him were a blur to me, but to *him*, I caught his gaze drinking each one in, his nose flaring when a guy sauntered past him. 

From a distance, my roommate appeared unchanged, wearing a faded, threadbare t-shirt bearing a logo that had long since peeled away, a pair of well-worn jeans with frayed edges and a patch over one knee.  So much for his *pretentious phase.* 

The glasses were a *choice*.

His dark brown curls were tousled and unkempt, partially hidden under a baseball cap that looked like it had seen better days. But as he drew nearer, I could see his mask slowly starting to crumble. 

His wide smile faltering, twitching into a grimace. 

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. Like something was sucking the life from him. 

Closing in on me, his penetrating gaze hidden behind a pair of raybans, my mediocre lunch crept up my throat. 

I stepped back, scanning for am exit.

And like he had read my mind, his steps quickened. 

He was still wearing that disguise. Still mimicking my best friend. 

Hiding whatever spell he was under.

Rowan oozed broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. 

In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favorite. 

Rowan knew that. It had been my  coffee order every time we studied there as a four.  

“Yooo, Nin! Sup!"" Rowan was attracting stares as he sort of danced towards me, tripping over his feet, only for him to steady himself with a grin. 

His words were slurred slightly when he handed me the drink, and he stumbled, managing to right himself. He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “That's your roommate? Rowan Beck?"" 

I didn’t get a chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me craaaaazy!” My roommate said in a slurred giggle. He stumbled again, and this time my hand shot out to steady him on impulse. I caught the flash of disgust on his face. Still wearing that smile, he swiped my hand off of his shoulder. “But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us! Which is like, sooo rude. You could have just sent us a text, but noooo, you decided to be cool and mys-te-ri-ous.""

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” 

Rowan cocked his head. He had that stupid smile again. The one he pulled during a full moon. Outside though, it was daylight, the sun shining in the sky.  

“Drunk? You think I can get drunk? Nah man, I just feel kinda shit. He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days. Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My roommate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you!"" He spread out his arms, a choked laugh escaping his lips. ""You’re the guy who wrote that fucking article about us!” 

Rowan was causing a scene and he didn't give a shit. I couldn't tell if he was moon drunk, or just more insane than usual. 

He jumped in front of Sam, with the kind of manic energy which was still him, and yet cranked to 100. “Loved it, Fuller! You're a literary genius! Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake. A truly riveting read.""  

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my roommate's name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” Rowan’s lips curled into a smirk. He leaned close to the guy, raising an eyebrow, his words more of a breathy laugh. “Why? Do you want me to pass a message to him?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go."" He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m… I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, all right?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, noooo. Don't gooooo.” Rowan mocked a pout, turning to me. 

“Damn. Did he seem… offended? By my presence?"" He waved Sam away with a grin. ""Anyway! Imogen is making dinner tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” 

I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. 

His tone was already puppeteering my limbs. 

My roommate twisted around, shooting me a sheepish smile. 

“Okayyyy, you got me! I should probably apologize for the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across the state?” Rowan’s hand tightened around my arm. ""Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

I needed answers. Maybe he was finally going to tell me what the fuck was going on. Rowan was still my roommate. 

I had lived with him for two years. I needed to know what was going with them. Why were they like this? And why, according to him, this was my fault. 

Rowan jumped into the drivers seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. “At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” My housemate sent me a mocking look, “Wait, did you? Oh, man, what did I do this time? The last thing I remember is playing Monopoly, and I think at some point I cuffed you to your bed.”

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. 

My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. 

I felt like I was on fire, my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. 

“You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. 

That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. 

He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. 

My roommate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. His skin looked… cracked. 

Like it was splintering apart. 

And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. 

There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. 

Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. 

“You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. ""Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, tapping out a tune. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good.” He tipped his head back, eyes rolling back, like he was in euphoria.

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. 

His eyes flickered shut at a red light. “You would not believe how good the human skull tastes when mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's fucking *insane*. Your skin is my favorite part.""

He tapped a beat with his shoe. ""Damn, you taste good. Like chicken! But a little sour.”

When I grabbed for the door handle, one arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, the other straying on the wheel. 

He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. “The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s tolerable. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” 

His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name again, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned. 

Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.” He whistled. “Talk.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. 

He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” 

Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together. You, me, Kaz and Immie. And yeah, when I’m agitated or it’s nearing totality, I start to remember pieces of it.” His voice broke, which was so unlike him.

So haunted, so hollow and wrong. “Why I… why I fucking despise you, Nin.” He was trembling, and when I dared look, his skin was slowly coming apart, a cocktail of moonlight and static pouring out. 

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. 

He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. 

Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. 

“She takes all the bad away,” he whispered, a dreamy smile spreading across his lips. “As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think or breathe, and I can look at you with rose-tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s fucking bliss. Like I’m….drowning.” Rowan sighed, dragging his hand through his hair. 

“Not now,” he said. “Now, she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.”

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. 

“Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. 

“She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact.

Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing black and white static. “She’s in my head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My roommate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else's. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the fucking car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. ""You suck at being a serial killer."" 

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

""Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. 

“I catch you eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Did you guys seriously think I’d just go along with whatever this is? Are you trying to shield me, is that it?” 

I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. 

And at that moment I realized we were both under her spell. Both of us were screaming at each other. 

Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. 

It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. 

Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. 

I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. 

“I caught you chewing on what I presume was my *twenty sixth* body! What the fuck do you think you can shield me from?” 

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “I’m sorry, *shield* you?” He turned to me fully, and I realized, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. 

“Are you fucking *kidding* me?” My roommate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “Do you think I like looking at you, knowing that you’re completely oblivious about what you… about what you did to us? No, it fucking hurts! You think I *want* to play happy families with you?” Rowan was cracking. 

I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

I noticed him inching away from me. 

“That's why I *eat*, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What did I *do*?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is *that*?”

No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no signs of cars. I swallowed. “What did you see?""

Rowan shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like the world had been ripped apart in front of us.

Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. 

But I had no time to scream, no time to think or breathe. 

Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. 

Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air, my roommate's car shredded apart. The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel this. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I wasn't supposed to– 

Exist. 

I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine. It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

Dying kind of feels like melting. I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and trickling from my lips. I could taste rust, and I couldn't stop it. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelids flickering, like they were unsure what to do.

The sky was pretty. I think I tried to name a star, before everything just kind of… melted. 

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I really felt it. 

Melting. 

I melted into the ground, my body and thoughts fragmenting. 

Before whatever had taken me choked me back out. 

Death had rejected me. 

After a disorienting moment of *nothing*, trapped between nothing and something, awareness came back to me in splinters, reality bleeding back into focus. I could feel the breeze tickling my back. 

I had…moved.

I was no longer where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash.

Now I was lying on my stomach. 

Something tickled my face. 

Grass. 

I was lying face down on the side of the road.  

I can’t describe the sensation it was to awaken only being part real. 

When I sat up, I felt real. 

I felt like I was part of this universe. 

But looking down at myself, I resembled a ghost, both see-through and not. Prodding at my skin, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face worked effortlessly, carving my outline and stitching me back together. 

My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. 

I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. 

Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

Once I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still wide open, still struggling to name that constellation. 

When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. 

I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my roommate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered with gore, his brain leaking from his ears. 

“Rowan.”

I stopped shaking him when I realized his spine had snapped, his body more liquid than solid. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still there, but faint, as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. His head lolled to the side, and I saw and *felt* that final breath escape his lips. When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, I dropped onto my knees. 

There it was again. 

This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the car wreck, blinking through intense light. It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. Like a polaroid coming to life. 

Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

He was beautiful, like a shadow coming to life, a sketch bleeding into a human. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into  contorted reality. This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

Did my asshole roommate just *respawn*? 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my roommate be brought to life, his chest rising and falling, eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him. 

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground, barely physical. Which made me easier to capture. 

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me, something cold suffocating my nose and mouth. In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed an adult figure lifting  Rowan into their arms, his body still flickering in and out of existence. 

Before I could cry out, I was forced to inhale, choking on what smelled like lemons. 

Before my body went limp, and I allowed myself to be dragged into the pitch dark."

**Chapter Theme:** [**alt-J (∆) Breezeblocks (youtube.com)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeMiVU77wo&list=RD3vjkh-acmTE&index=3)

**Chapter 13.**

**A wanderer in the narrows.**

My goal for the next day was to discover where the Redcaps had been raiding their supplies. I realized last night after cleaning out the rest of the lair that there had to be a settlement nearby to explain the barrels of water and beer as well as the salted food I’d discovered in the center of their hideout.

Preparing foodstuffs and storing potable water wasn’t an activity that such lowly creatures were known for. But stealing from those who could sounded exactly right. So, after indulging in a deep slumber that went well past noon, I set off with Schulz and Rachel in tow to find out who else shared these wilds with me.

The heat of the afternoon sun on my skin felt glorious. I was so distracted by the pleasure of it that I wanted nothing more than to park myself on a field of soft grass and bask in its radiance like a housecat beneath an open window. How can humans find such continual misery in their lives? Why were they so quarrelsome towards each other in the face of such contentment?

Didn’t they realize they could eat and sleep whenever they wanted? They could pass their lives in joy and peace and never know a moment’s worry ever again. Why did they prefer squandering their short lives in pursuit of something as arbitrary as meaningfulness? Why bother with any of that when merely existing was purpose enough?

Honestly, they had such a good thing going. Why did they love complicating it so much?

Before long, I stumbled across the settlement the Redcaps had been stealing from. It wasn’t nearly as well defended as the gates of Gardenia. It was a small town warded by large wooden walls and a guarded gate that closed it off from the surrounding wilderness. As I neared the main entryway, two strong looking men armored in plate challenged my approach.

“Halt and identify yourself,” one of them said. Like me, he carried a spear, but he also wore a sword at his hip. The handle of it was well-worn, suggesting it had seen much use during his tenure as a guard. That wouldn’t be surprising, considering how many monsters dwelt in these parts. He probably had to kill something every other day.

“Just a wandering Hunter seeking trade,” I said humbly. “I came across a nest of Redcaps the other day and dealt with them. Knowing how troublesome they are, I thought I’d see if anyone had placed a bounty on them.”

“You’re a *wanderer*, you say?” the guard asked doubtfully. “Where’s your identification?”

“You mean those pictures with serial numbers and the like?” I asked him, feigning ignorance of his request. “Wouldn’t know where to get one. I’m not fancy like them city folks.”

The guards had a nice laugh between themselves before my questioner continued. “Well, kid, around these parts you aren’t allowed to call yourself a Hunter if you’re not registered. These aren’t the middle-states. We do things properly in the Eastern Kingdoms.”

“Proper’s good. I can do proper,” I said earnestly. “Where do I sign up?”

“You been schooled?” the guard asked. “What’s your education?”

“What, you mean like did I go to Vandal Academy?”

The guards laughed again. “No, no, that’s for the elites. No blue blood’s son is going to show up at the Narrows, looking to barter a few goblin ears.”

“Hey, now. Vandal ain’t that stuffy,” said the other guard. “Nicky Pankratz’s boy made his way there. Earned himself a probationary D-Rank. And don’t forget dear Cassie at the trading post.”

“Kids like those are one in a million,” the senior guard scoffed. “The rest are castoffs and wanderers like this forest rat. Son, we don’t know you from Adam, and we can’t take things on trust. Don’t think poorly of me but be on your way.”

“Why would I think poorly of you?” I asked. “Guarding a settlement is honorable work. In times such as these, it’s better to be a wary man than a foolish one.”

“I’m glad you understand,” the guard nodded. “Now be off with you.”

I waved and turned my heel on them.

Naturally, I came back a few minutes later under my cloak of stealth and slipped past them when they opened the gate to admit a few waggoneers. No offense to those brave and capable souls, but I’m not the sort to be thwarted by mere watchmen. If I was, I'd never have any interesting stories to tell.

The town beyond the gates was an interesting sight to see. Rebuilt Americana, reclaimed from whatever disasters had wracked this world before the coming of their system. I wonder what drove these hearty civilians to flee the safety of Gardenia’s walls to eke out a living in this dangerous environment. Maybe they were braver. Maybe they were less civilized. Maybe they just didn’t want to let the monsters win.

Whatever the reason, I was impressed by their resilience.

Now, where could I go to sell a few Redcap ears?

\_\_

“Are you a hunter?” the old man asked suspiciously.

I hadn’t been in town for more than ten minutes when a screen suddenly appeared before my eyes and informed me that a world quest was now being offered.

**Red (with blood) Lobster.**

**Rank D.**

**From: Tradesman Calford (non-ascended.)**

*I’ve had it up to here with all these damn monster crustaceans lurking around my pond like they own it! These* ***Koler Crabs*** *are twice the size of a grown man and those claws of theirs will snip an arm off faster than you can blink! I ain’t got much in the way of money but to the one who gets rid of them, I’ll offer a year’s worth of free meals! That’s nothing to sneeze at! Please help me out!*

***Request: Slay x12 Koler Crabs at Tradesman Calford’s pond.***

***Bonus: Discover where they originate from.***

***Rewards: One Free meal a day for a year. +2,200 EXP. +400 Narrows Reputation.***

Interesting. I didn’t know ordinary people could put out requests for assistance directly through the system. It seemed that even those who couldn’t ascend had limited access to its services.

Hmm. One free meal a day for a year, eh? Now *that* was a tempting offer.

“I am,” I replied to the old fellow. “I came in response to your system-borne request, didn’t I?”

“I hope that’s true,” he said. “If you’ve truly come to help then I’m glad you came. But the reward is more meager than you’re probably accustomed to, Hunter…?”

“*Stragos*,” I said. “Just call me Stragos. And to the contrary, sir, I believe this will pay me splendidly in experience.”

“I don’t think it’ll give you a lot of experience points either,” he said.

Wow, what an honest man.

“No, I meant experience as in the novel enjoyment of doing something I haven’t tried before,” I said. “I love doing new things.”

“You just want to do this…for fun?” he asked with some minor confusion.

“Of course,” I said chirpily. “I’m new around here and I treasure opportunities to expand my horizons. To fill my empty cup with the heady brew of experience is nearly payment enough for my services.”

“Really? Well in that case, maybe we can—”

“Uh, but I will still be requiring material compensation, of course,” I said quickly. “Education nourishes the mind, but food is what keeps us alive, yes?”

“Hmph,” he said with some disappointment. “Well, that’s the truth of things, I guess. Let me get you caught up on what’s been happening here.”

“What’s to know? Your rights as a landowner are being impugned upon by impertinent shellfish. Have no fear, I’ll have the matter sorted in no time,” I said to him.

“Oh, but Hunter Stragos, I’m afraid the situation is a little more complicated than the request would have you believe,” the old man said nervously.

“Oh? Pray tell,” I said.

“Well, the thing is…I put that request out a year ago and no one’s seen fit to answer it in all this time,” he said fretfully. “And it seems that Koler Lobsters are *fast* breeders. The scale of the situation is a little above its ranking…”

“In that case, we’ll have to negotiate,” I said grimly.

“What more can I possibly offer you?” he asked desperately.

“Free meals for life seems about right to me,” I said mildly.

He blinked rapidly and stared at me in surprise.

“That’s it?” he asked.

“Yup,” I said.

“You’d risk your only life for so little?” he asked with widened eyes.

“I like to eat,” I replied with absolute honesty.

“Son, are you alright in the head?”

“I’m just living life the best way I know,” I said with a friendly smile. I then held forth my hand. “We got a deal?”

The old man gave a hearty guffaw and held out a hand of his own, and we shook on it. “Son, I think we do!”

**\[Tradesman Calford likes your attitude.\]**

**\[You’ve gained +50 Narrows rep.\]**

**\_\_**

It took about twenty minutes of further walking before I found a large country house on the outskirts of town that had been built in front of a large outdoor body of water. Calford’s directions had been precise and easy to follow. I came around to the back of the building and tapped on a glass door on the patio.

As expected, a woman soon answered. A raven-haired beauty in a white sundress who gave me a dazzling smile and invited me inside.

“You’re Hunter…Stragos?” she asked with a charming lilt to her voice that quickly had my ears buzzing. Goodness, if I were a younger man, a woman of this caliber would be a problem for me.

“I am indeed,” I said, greeting her with a smile of my own. We were now inside a large kitchen where she bid me to sit on a stool at the counter. “Did Mr. Calford call to inform you I’m here to take care of your seafood infestation?”

“He did. But all by yourself?” she asked with a raised eyebrow.

“I brought my dog too,” I said.

“Do you have some kind of beast mastery class? Are you a ranger perhaps?” she asked.

“No, but I’m still an apex predator,” I said humbly. “I’m just waiting for nightfall when they’ll be easier to deal with.”

“You’re definitely not lacking for confidence,” she commented.

“The only thing I’m lacking right now is a name to call you,” I said. “Miss?”

The woman grinned and showed me the ring on her finger. “*Mrs.* actually. Jamie Wells-Calford. So pleased to meet you, Mr. Stragos.”

“Goodness, aren’t you a little young for him?” I asked with no small amount of surprise.

In response, she guffawed and swiped her hand lightly through my hair. “That’s my father-in-law, silly. I’m married to his oldest son, Kurt. He’s currently away in military service.”

“You could do better,” I said without delay.

“Cheeky. But sadly, for you, I dearly love the man I’m with.”

“Curse you, Kurt Calford and your superior timing,” I lamented.

“Luck is half of the game,” Jamie said with a knowing look.

“It always is,” I replied. “You know, I’d comment further on your beauty, but words would be redundant.”

“If they weren’t, what would you say?” she asked me.

“For starters? Are you doing anything later?”

“I’m sorry sweetie, but you’re a little too fresh off the shelf to be that forward with your elders,” she said. “I have a daughter around your age.” Her tone sounded regretful, but her eyes were bright with cheerful amusement.

“If I’m a boy, it’s in appearance alone. I assure you, I have a very old soul,” I replied.

“Do you mean to say you’re an educated man?” she asked.

“Very much so,” I said with all due humility.

“And do you intend to share that knowledge with me?” she wondered.

“*That* will depend on your flexibility.”

“With my schedule?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

“Oh, Lord, aren’t you a bad one?” she giggled.

“I think you’re catching on,” I said with considerable satisfaction as I took a sip from the cup she offered me. “This is very good by the way. Preparing a good cup of tea takes nimble fingers.”

“My dexterity is a wonder to behold,” she bragged proudly.

“You’ll have to show me in person,” I suggested.

“I’d better warn my girl about you when she gets back,” the woman laughed. “Bold young men are their own kind of danger.”

“No need for that,” I assured her. “Girls don’t interest me. *Women* do.”

“And what sort of women do you prefer?” she asked as she leaned a little closer.

“Depends on the dessert they provide with the meal,” I said with a wink.

“And what’s your favorite kind, I wonder?” she asked.

“Cake.”

“You like cake?”

“I *love* cake.”

“Got a particular flavor in mind?”

I closed my eyes and breathed in the varied scents of the room. “Something with cherries would be good. Double layered. Sweet on top, *sweeter* on the inside.”

“The only thing around here with cherries in it is my lip gloss,” she said.

“Wow, whatever are the odds?”

“Sorry I couldn’t help you out,” she said wryly.

“That doesn’t mean you have nothing to offer,” I countered.

“How did you ever get this full of yourself?” she laughed.

“Come with me and I’ll show you.”

“Can’t do it, I’m happily wedded,” she sighed.

“We all make mistakes,” I said. “Every day is a new beginning.”

“I definitely need to warn my daughter,” she said decisively to herself with a firm nod. “Want a sandwich?”

“I’d *love* a sandwich,” I said.

“Jamie, who’re you talking to in there?” an imperious sounding old woman said as she marched into the kitchen. “Is this him? Hurry up and get him out to the pond. I wish you wouldn’t drag your feet so much.”

“Carol, he’s waiting until night to take care of it,” Jamie said as she hurriedly began preparing my meal. The harassed look on her face caught me off guard. Not a trace of the friendliness that had been there earlier remained.

The atmosphere of the kitchen had changed perceptibly. Before, there had been a languid yet welcoming energy. A relaxed, homey vibe. The kind of pleasant feeling you got from a restful, lazy day.

But as soon as the older woman entered, an unpleasant sensation quickly choked that feeling away. Carol must have been one of those unfortunate souls who by sheer dint of her awful personality, could kill the mood of wherever she set foot. People like her could suffocate any shared space. They’d be deadly if they could be weaponized.

“The fault is entirely my own,” I said apologetically to the old woman. “I use a specific strategy for dealing with infestations of monsters and it works best at night. Your daughter-in-law has been gracious enough to indulge me in conversation while I await sunset.”

“She’s an idling layabout,” Carol said snippily. “You must be one as well. I warned my son she was too pretty for him. He married her anyway. Pretty girls like to think they shouldn’t have to work for a living, and this one’s no different. Getting her to perform any kind of useful task is a chore in and of itself.”

“Carol, I work hard enough in my tavern,” Jamie said with forced patience. “I also make more than enough to cover all the bills around here. I could have even offered a reward in gold for this hunter's services if you weren’t too proud to accept my coin.”

“What you do isn’t *real* work,” Carol sniffed. “Nor a wife’s duty. Staying out all hours of the night in service to *other* men. You should consider how that looks for my boy, if you're even capable of that sort of reflection.”

“I work alongside plenty of women as well,” Jamie said with a roll of her eyes. “I assure you I’m on my feet all day and hardly my back.”

“Backtalking *slut,”* Carol said venomously. As soon as the words were past her lips, she and Jamie began glaring daggers at each other.

Extended families can be hell. Millions of people surely suffered from the generational clashes that arose when a domineering older traditionalist tries to set herself over a more liberal-minded replacement, in a deadly struggle for control of the household. I felt glad to have never personally known such strife in my own home. It’s a very easy thing for a vampire to wait out the lifespans of a spouse's family. I’ve succeeded at it three times. It's no bother at all to spend eighty years in hiding if it means never having to meet your wife’s parents.

“Is Jamie really someone you should be judging?” I asked Carol a few moments later. “It was your son she married, not you. Why should your opinion on anything matter?”

“Excuse me?” Carol said angrily. “Boy, who the hell do you think you are?”

“A student of repeating patterns,” I said as I sipped more tea. “One who also likes reading about interesting psychological conditions. Have you ever heard of covert incest? That’s where someone experiences sexual jealousy towards the spouse of one of their adult children.”

“Where I *what?”* she gasped.

“I wasn’t speaking of you. But it’s interesting that that’s where your mind automatically went,” I said. “But seriously, your bile is uncalled for. Such an acrimonious attitude towards your son’s wife makes you look like quite a horrid person.”

“H-how dare you say such horrible things!” she choked out.

“Whose fault is greater? Mine for making a mild observation or yours for airing your dirty laundry in front of a stranger?” I asked. “I can’t stand vexatious people, Carol. And since the particulars of my contract with your husband have nothing to do with *you,* I recommend you go back to your den and allow me to enjoy my meal in peace.”

Jamie burst into appreciative laughter at my words. In fact, she laughed so hard that she began coughing, which necessitated pouring herself a glass of water, leaving her back turned to me and the old woman.

“How dare you speak to me in that manner! This is MY HOME—” Carol began to say in her increasingly wearisome manner. I was already tired of hearing her voice and I possess enough patience to watch a stone erode into sand. This sort of attitude is what develops when someone lives too long without being challenged. I decided it was time to bring her back down to Earth.

Y’know, for *her* sake. Before she met someone less willing to forgive and forget.

So, before Carol could continue her nattering and spoil my mood any further, I leaned in very closely and whispered, “Leave right now or I’ll return while you’re sleeping *and eat you alive.”*

I then briefly shifted into my undead form and gave her a very toothy smile. If you’ve ever been grinned at by a shark that could unhinge its jaws to bite *more of you*, then you’ll understand the immediate effect I had on her.

I think she got my point.

My pointed teeth, anyway.

\[**You have successfully intimidated Carol Calford.\]**

**\[Carol is terrified of your true vampiric visage.\]**

**\[Carol fails a willpower check. She won’t tell anyone what she saw today.\]**

With a stricken look on her face, Carol very quickly made her way out of the room, leaving me to spend a few enjoyable hours shooting the breeze with Jamie, who for a time become a dear friend of mine. When I mentioned my difficulty producing identification for the town watch, she promised to help me out later by using her connections. ""I know a few people,"" she grinned.

Goodness, how lucky can one guy be?

It was completely my loss that Jamie sincerely loved her husband. Not only was she temptation incarnate, but the sandwiches she made were out of this world.

When the sun finally went down, I thanked her for the pleasant time we shared. Then with my spear in hand and Schulz by my side, I set forth to hunt some Koler Crabs.

"The Farlands Campaign, Part 11",HFY,1e67vyz,2024-07-18 06:14:23,7,0.77,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1e67vyz/the_farlands_campaign_part_11/,pracksack,OC,"The sound of footsteps against a wooden floor became louder as I slowly returned to consciousness. I felt the warmth of cloth over me and the softness of a cushion beneath my head. As my vision became clear as I continued to rise from my rest, I realized I'd not only been moved to some sort of bed, but an entirely different room after having succumbed to my exhaustion the night before. Still disoriented, I shifted in my bed to see who was walking around the sleeping chamber. A smaller figure wearing simple garments walked between tables, rearranging the contents both on their surfaces and in the figure's hand. A strangely inviting scent of warm grains and meat began flowing over the room, and I decided to inspect what I assumed was food for that morning. Still reeling from my slumber, I had failed to consider that the figure standing before me would be wholly unfamiliar with both my kind as well as my appearance. Without consideration, I shuffled across the room and peered from over her shoulder to see exactly what humans tended to eat when given time to properly prepare a meal.

The figure, which turned out to be a young human female, turned after detecting my presence. She turned back around to continue preparing the table before pausing and turning back around to consider who, or rather *what*, was standing behind her. She gasped and released a shrill beep before reflexively clasping  bother of her paws over her mouth. I decided to ignore her instinctual fear response and took a strange metal object from the table, which was oddly similar to a fishing spear but shrunken to the size of a writing implement. I shifted it in my hands to find the most comfortable grip before I began prodding the strange human foods. The ceramic plates were filled with an array of small white pellets covered in brown meat and multicolored vegetables. Another smaller plate had dry and brittle orange disks. The largest of the plates had several large teardrop shaped clubs of what I presumed was meat on account of the bone that protruded at the end of them.

The human girl, who had moved into a far corner of the room, and with a single hand still over her mouth, began moving inconspicuously towards the door at the other end of the room. Still I refused to pay any heed to her fear and impassively turned to her holding one of the orange meat clubs.

""I presume this is food but...what exactly are each of these dishes comprised of?"" I inquired.

She remained silent for a few moments before lowering her hands and slowly making her way towards me. She stood at the end of another table, still somewhat distant from me. This table had several other dishes and more chairs, which most likely meant others would join to eat with me soon. She took one of the shrunken tridents and demonstrated by holding one of the ceramic plates a short distance away from her face. She began using the implement to carry a portion of the food into her mouth, which I decided to replicate with the white pellets. The thin tendrils of dark meat coated my tongue with a savory and sharp warmth. My eyes widened as the vibrant vegetables began sending stinging darts of tang across the soft and plain white pellets. With each bite, I could feel the intertwining aggression of the vegetables merge with the robust meat and plain grains. The incredible sensation took control over my ability to feign my composure. The few amounts of food I had been given on the Captain's oceanic craft were either small or completely inedible due to their age. I began impatiently shoveling the dish into my mouth.

I paused to see the human girl staring at me with astonishment. The unsightly view of me so carelessly indulging in food made me realize I had flung large portions of food onto the ground. I could also see several pieces of the white pellets were stuck to my snout. Still not wanting to ignore the opportunity to eat such an appetizing dish, I continued eating slowly, my eyes still firmly upon the human who also stared at me unflinchingly. I continued to eat whatever I could before deciding I'd been satisfied that morning. Everything was palatable, from the sweet and fruit-like orange disks to the meat clubs. I had also been given a warm, dark liquid with a bitter taste, which seemed to have some sort of stimulating properties, as after having several cupfuls of it, I felt more energized and alert than I would otherwise be in the morning. That was when the same man from the night before, the one with the black clothing who had comforted me when I lost all composure, entered the room.

""Iluminada, if Señor Jutta's presence makes you uneasy you can tend to the goats. We have run out of cheese so it would do us a lot of help to make more as soon as possible,"" said the man.

As he spoke, again with the usual softness of his compassion, I stared at the floor so as to spare myself from the disgrace I had made of myself. Like a kit, I clung to him and wept, desperate to feel a sense of ease in this turbulent time, still unsure as to whether I was a friend or a tool to these humans. The words he said to me in that moment were exactly those that I needed to hear to surrender to my fatigue. Still, some of what he said was unclear to me; it seemed as if that place had been some sort of shrine of heritage, as he used the word ""father"" several times. Would the humans have beliefs so similar to ours?

The human girl left the room and I was again alone with the human who I assumed was some sort of cleric. He sat at the same table across from me and began eating the orange meat clubs.

I said, ""You're that man who I sat with last night? What was your name?""

He replied, ""Padre Raimundo de León, if you would prefer you can call me Padre de León. You look lively today Señor Jutta; however, I cannot help but notice you seem somewhat distressed. ¿Qué te aflige todavía hoy?""

""Before all of this, I was a Captain in the Hekhadian ground fleet. I assume that, after I fell asleep, you may have spoken with Captain Pedro and that he explained to you all that concerns me? It is not only customary, but entirely required, that all officers in the ground fleet maintain an air of total stolidity. To show a person, especially those not of the military caste, that we are weak or irascible, is to fail your obligations to the Empire. My display of sorrow and exhaustion was a most disgraceful example of my fortitude crumbling,"" I explained.

He replied, ""If I may offer you my consolation, I would like to inform you that no such thing will be required of you by me. I am not a soldier, but I do understand what it means to maintain oneself before soldados. You must appear like a lion even when your heart is frail like a sheep. Discúlpeme, usted no conoce a esos animales. I mean you must be fierce even when you are afraid. You must understand this, Señor Jutta, I am a Priest, not a soldier. If you are worried about the others, they did not see your tears or hear your weeping. They asked me why I required that you be left alone, and I simply told them that I sensed '*espíritu de pesadez*' over you.""

I released a heavy sigh of relief, I had been wholly convinced that my image had been effectively tarnished before the humans who held my fate in their hands. Now feeling relieved, I decided the strange human cleric would likely have some business to do with me as he not only comforts me, he also offered me an array of incredible human foods.

""So, are you a cleric or monastic of some sort? The words you spoke to me last night, what did you mean by them? I cannot understand how exactly it is you were able to sense my distress? Also, where am I?"" I inquired.

""This is La Posada de la Esperanza, a place for lodging to the pilgrims, wayward, and tired. You are also correct in that I am clergy, un párroco to be exact. If it is a wonder how I was able to know your pain, I would ask if you are willing to spend a while in discussion as I had a few of my own questions to ask you,"" he replied.

I nodded, and he began his answer, ""What I said last night, in regards to how it was that I knew your burden, is that I have grown to know the hearts of men and women. All of us share common emotions and desires; however, not every one of us may struggle with the same ones at the same time. Some tears are shed because someone dies, someone that was loved and will surely be missed. Other times, they are shed because someone is overwhelmingly happy, so unable to contain their joy that it simply flows out of them. I did not see either of those en tus ojos, no sorrow or happiness, but instead a great emptiness. I have seen the same thing come from other men who do not quite know themselves because their situation is grave or because they go along with life and do not know where they are going to end up. It is a panic, we call it '*desasosiego*'. You are so concerned with what is happening to you or what is going to happen. Because it does not resemble exactly what you have planned for yourself, or what others tell you is required, you cannot help but feel defeated as you have lost this battle against yourself to shape your own experiences. Rezo por conocer este sentimiento todavía, it has been a long time, but I still remember yo también fui soldado. Marching with una lanza alongside the lanceros y dragones.""

I raised my head in shock. This man was once a soldier with a human ground fleet and now acted as a religious adherent. He had used his foreknowledge and applied it with his consolation that night. What I could not understand was how a person could change so drastically insofar as the caste divide was concerned. I knew the humans did not have a social paradigm as rigid as the Empire's, but such unrestricted access to whatever profession would surely cause some sort of chaos. How possibly could a fighter become a cleric?

I replied, ""You used to be in a ground fleet? No wonder you understand. But this only raises two more questions in my mind. How possibly could someone switch from one duty to the next so freely? How also can a person, sharing in military obligations and ambitions reconcile their abdication without coming across as though some sort of seditionist!""

He smiled and said, ""Because there are no greater obligations or ambitions that one can hope to set out and do than those that are also of God. Remember how I have spoken to you of a Father and likened those who are aggrieved to los niños? I was speaking with symbols. We humans are subject to many things, but those of us here in these islands choose to be subject to a single deity. When I say la parroquia is like a Father's house, it is because our faith sees correlations. He, who is God, is also like a Father to the children, in need of many things that can only be given by Him. In that moment, where I saw your desire for rest, I also saw that your tiredness was from the world throwing you into a place and time that did not resemble your previous wishes. This sudden disappointment became fear. It is not childish to wish for things to go right, but like a child, we believe our God will offer us the things that we need as opposed to the things we want. So let me ask my question to you, Señor Jutta: What is it that you wished for yourself?""

I answered solemnly, ""To follow alongside the many men who serve the Empire, and as they journey into the far realms, with a hope for victory sewn deep into their hearts, that I would plant our banner of war into the dirt and claim another victory for my people.""

He replied, ""You would find, against all your wishes, that you came to a land where many more also wish the same for themselves and their people. They are sometimes called Británicos, Españoles, Franceses, and other times Holandeses. Now they are called Hekhadianos and their skin is covered in scales, their heads have horns, and sus extremos tienen colas. But they are the same inside. I was that way, but then I learned that God, who is like a Father, is also sometimes like un General. We, who are sometimes like children, are also sometimes like soldados. You say that I may fail my people by having put away mi espada, mi pistola y mi lanza? No, Señor Jutta, I have changed my uniforme from white to black. I have changed mi espada to be my words instead. My battle is no longer against men but rather the darkness inside of them. But before I could go out to fight for them, I had to defeat myself. I would not know truly what it was that I wanted of my life until I surrendered it to service, and only then was I able to truly help my people, my country, and flourish.""

I was afflicted by his examination of my circumstance. Had I been truly disillusioned so deeply by Imperial protocol, or had I set out to accomplish only for myself, under the guise of a greater cause? Truly I had felt empty as the uncertainty of my life closed in on me, that there was nothing that could be done to reverse my capture, forced sedition, and eventual service to the very species I vowed I would conquer. My introspective assessment led me to a shocking realization - if the mere association with humans would garner me the reputation of a traitor, let alone offering my service to them; and now realizing I was growing to share their convictions, what more offense could I cause? What better thing to do then, in such a case as this, to change more than one's own outlook, but approach to life entirely, just as Padre de León seemed to have done.

This must mean that this man, aged and humble, eating white pellets in a dimly lit room, and dressed only in black, once desired something that, in reality, only worsened the condition that plagues many, but is withdrawn from few: What do we want for ourselves? And when such a desire is contrasted against what must be done to help those around us, a great battle ensues that cannot be won with weapons of any kind. This battle is against the self, and Padre de León, in that moment revealed to me that he has indeed won such a battle, by defeating himself, and metaphorically killing all that he was before.

Renewed, he would live as a metaphorical kit doing all that was commanded of him by this deified 'Father'. Now assailed by the thought of all prior notions within me being similarly disestablished, another question crossed my mind. How exactly would I go about truly enjoying all that this new world had to offer me, all the while sacrificing myself to see the best possible outcome for all people as it relates to this war? The answer was far more obvious than the last, as I had been traveling with the exact three humans who would make such a thing possible.

I felt my ears swing forward with anticipation and remembered the finer details of the night before. I asked Padre de León, "" What is this '*Ordo Sanctum Veritatis Illuminatae*' you spoke of last night?""

I could tell, from the shift in his expression, that Padre de León was still keen on addressing the more abstract nuances in my character. His glanced at me before quickly rushing to the door and peering outside of it for a few moments. He then pulled a chair from the table and set it against the door's handle so as to keep anyone from entering. The sudden apprehension I felt from this display was only increased when he stood only a pace away from me.

He said in a quite tone, ""Le pido disculpas Señor Jutta, but I must warn you not to announce the name of that order without first ensuring the unwanted ears are not listening. The Ordo Sanctum Veritatis Illuminatae is an office within La Iglesia Católica. Some time ago, el oficio de la Santa Inquisición was established to persecute los herejes, falsos sacerdotes y abusadores. The office would conduct itself as a tribunal assembly, and amongst its ranks a host of many talented Promotores de la Fe, Promotores de la Justicia, Defensores, as well as many others.

El año de nuestro Señor, 1678, the Inquisidor Ignazio Destrada, as he was investigating in Francia he found a remnant order of cismático '*Jansenistas*' who reported a number of their laypeople were suddenly becoming oppressed. So as to ensure that this oppression was not a demonic incursion in disguise, Ignazio Destrada made his way to their place and discovered something far stranger. One of the afflicted became mad because he saw something he could not explain. He was sent to a monastery and spent every day in his cell drawing strange patterns on his walls, saying the names of what was thought to be evil spirits.

Ignazio Destrada decided to allow for the afflicted to draw the images and speak the names without objection. The man regained his sanity and recalled that the symbols and names were told to him through un sigilo, much like the one you wore which allows you to speak Inglés. El sigilo did not give him the ability to speak, but rather the ability to hear the voices of those who were note near.

The Inquisidor, like many others, believed the los artefactos were pagan or infernal in origin. But when exorcismo y purificación would cause nothing, he asked académicos to aid him in his understanding of their origin. It was not until he consulted un cosmógrafo that the truth became revealed to him. The carvings on el sigilo matched a series of overlapping constelaciones. In reality, no pagan gods or demonios gave these artifacts their powers, they were instead keys that unlocked mystical powers for those who wield them.

Such incredible power, as it is not from God, must still be destroyed; for soon after Ignazio Destrada discovered the truth, he was poisoned and the artifact was stolen. He survived the attack and reported to his compañeros that there were many more relics just like it and that many scoundrels wished to take their power and set it against the innocent, as it did to the laypeople and that afflicted man. Since that day, it was established by la Santa Inquisición that a new order must be made to seal away or destroy the sobrenatural. Señor Jutta, if ever there was a time to consider truly living to help the Hejadianos, that time would be now. Your arrival has confirmed to the authorities that our oficina was not only legitimate, but now in dire need of support. Those men, el Capitán General, el Capitán Pedro, y el Teniente Lanzo are also familiars of this office. So it comes to no surprise then that they not only keep you alive, but do what they can to understand and quite possibly even befriend you. However, I will say they were wrong to assume you would be so willing without first considering retur-""

""I'll do it,"" I interjected. ""Never would I have believed that the world beyond the corridor would be so dangerous, so full of horror, and also so full of adventure, wisdom, and people more than willing to help such a creature as strange as I am. I know the path ahead will be more difficult than any I have ever traveled before; however, to object to such an opportunity would only be foolishly complying with the very reticence that has only afflicted me since my arrival. I would betray my honor as a man and an officer if I did not admit that I am consumed by fear even in this moment. At the same time, I have never felt more satisfied. You say I would do better to abandon what I want, and if what I want is glory, then let humility be my glory as it is for you. That way, I never truly set a course towards failure to begin with!""

Padre de León was again taken aback. He stood away from me slowly and rubbed his chin, as if to contemplate this sudden surge in boldness. I stood as well to confirm I did intend to change more than just my outlook. His small smile soon grew to a toothy grin.

He began laughing boisterously before saying joyously, ""Señor Jutta, como si Dios me gritara desde el cielo, you are more human than even some of those who live in this town.""

He then approached me and grabbed each of my shoulders with his hands, shaking me as one would a friend. He rushed to move the chair away from the door's handle and peered out to see if anyone was in the passageway of the building we were in. He hurriedly grabbed the blanket from the bed and threw it over me.

He said feverishly, ""Come quickly Señor Jutta, we must tell the others. However, to do so required us to be rápido, muy muy rápido! No on can see you like they did when you arrived.""

\*\*\*

We ducked in and out of passageways, crossed small bridges, and rose up and down several staircases. We continued towards the harbor before eventually stopping just beside a large collection of wooden crates next to the side of an old wooden building. Just as we were about to set out, I noticed a familiar face walking amongst the humans along the stone path. I tapped on Padre de León's shoulder and gestured towards the two men who stood beside the solitary yet recognizable human. Without a moment of hesitation, I rushed into the open walkway still holding the cloth tightly over my body. I managed to weave through the congestion of the harbor and caught up to the men who surrounded the person most likely to safely escort me to Captain Pedro. One of the large men standing as her escort quickly stepped in front of me to stop my charge. I then positioned myself to shout from around him; however, just before I was able to make myself known, the large human grabbed one end of the cloth draped over my head.

Knowing this would likely cause the already suspicious passerbys to become hysteric, just as they nearly were when I arrived, I threw the large blanket over the man which distracted him just long enough for me to slip past him.

""Mademoiselle Geneviève Duvalle?"" I asked from afar.

My intuition was affirmed as the lady turned to face me. She smiled and made her way towards me with an expression that was somehow a combination of happiness and concern. She rushed towards me, and so did the other two humans, one of whom I recognized to be Henri, the human who had accompanied her inside the citadel. While Henri and Geneviève most certainly recognized me, the other human did not. He stopped just before me and stood holding the large cloth still in his hands. Geneviève spontaneously snatched the blanket and threw it over me so as not to draw any more suspicion from the few humans who did manage to catch a glimpse of me. Padre de León then arrived, his breathing sharp and heavy, no doubt due to his age.

He grabbed me by the shoulder, causing me to twist and face him, to which he said, ""Señor Jutta! What are you doing? What sense does it make to show yourself to a human, and of all of them to set off for you choose Señorita Geneviève Duvalle?""

Geneviève replied, ""Père de Léon? Oh, c'est merveilleux, you also know l'aide de camp Jutta?""

Padre de León stuttered, looking between the two of us with bewilderment written across his face. He cleared his throat before gesturing towards the various people now gathering around us. One of whom shouted in his language, and soon after, a trio of those same uniformed humans dressed in white and carrying staves marched towards us.

Geneviève said, ""Jutta it is not safe for you to so carelessly show yourself! The people of the harbor say un diablotin cornu is walking around waiting to curse the island. I assume that is you, so don't dwell and let them take you!""

A deep passion within me was suddenly bolstered as I looked at the faces of the still wary humans. With a dread always looming over me like a great weight, I couldn't bear to carry it anymore and threw the blanket off me. I then walked ahead of the group with a determination like a flame that I did not intend to be so easily snuffed out by a cloth or the waters of the sea. I raised my chin high and grinned as I walked, swinging my legs farther in front of me to establish an exaggerated sense of status in the hearts of those who watched me. With Geneviève and Padre de León following close behind, their presence caused the otherwise hostile crowd to instead stand still.

All except for what was apparently another human child. The short human child moved between the legs of those in the crowd. When a female human tried to grab the child, I stepped forward and knelt down in front of him, keeping my gaze away from his so as not to evoke any fear within him. He stood uncertain for a few moments before extending his hand to perform the clasping and shaking of hands that humans often do when greeting one another. I took his hand and replicated the custom before also taking off my cap to speak to him.

I asked, ""Hello, I am Jutta. Do you speak the British tongue?""

Padre de León, Henri, and Geneviève stood behind me and pleaded for me not to remain in the public space, and especially not to speak with a child. I turned to face Padre de León and requested that he at least translate my next words for those who couldn't understand me. More and more humans began to gather, some cowering and shouting out of fear while others became impatient to move close enough to properly marvel at the sight of a foreign upright reptilian. Although hesitant, the crowd that surrounded us was large enough that making a good impression was the only real way to keep the humans from devolving into a superstitious panic. Padre de León reluctantly obliged.

Padre de León said, ""His name is Giancarlo Pacheco and él sólo habla español.""

I asked, ""I want to know why he stepped out from the crowd when everyone else is afraid to even look at me?""

""He says because he had never seen someone with a face like yours, clothes like yours, and a sword like the one you wear. He says the other children call him a coward for not fighting with them, and he wanted to prove them wrong.""

I replied, ""He has proven more than he knows. It is one thing to stand tall in the midst of a fearful thing, but you have done what even the adults around you refuse to. See me as more than scales, horns, and a feathery tail. What do you think I am, Giancarlo Pacheco?""

""He says he is glad to hear that he is brave, even by you. He also thinks you are una Iguana.""

~~a what?~~

""Tell him I am a Hekhadian. A proud and strong people who come from a land not like these, and that I am a soldier in their ground fleet. I have come to help the '*español'* people to the best of my ability.""

One human from the crowd shouted something that Padre de León quickly translated, ""He says you are whispering the devil's lies into the child's ears and attempting to condemn his soul.""

~~Literally what did any of that mean? Who is the devil? Human's and their confounding nomenclature I swear!~~

Before I could say anything, Padre de León shouted out towards the crowd and drew some kind of figurine that was tucked into his belt. I had not seen it before, but as it stood out in clear view, it looked almost as if a small human was carved and posed, outstretched, across a bisecting structure. He then thrust the object close to my face, which I misinterpreted as him offering the object to me. I took it from him and began more closely inspecting it, holding it up to the sunlight and absorbing the finer details of this strange and somewhat fetching icon made from wood and an earthy metal. Padre de León stuttered for a few seconds before I handed the object back to him.

The crowd, if not already unsteady, became even more so after I took the icon from the old cleric. That was when, at the farthest end of the cobbled path, I could see the familiar broad hats of Captain Pedro and Lieutenant Lanzo. Wishing to relay to them the decision I had made that morning, I once again set off to meet them before Padre de León and Mademoiselle Geneviève Duvalle could follow to restrain me from doing so. My talons clicked against the moistened stones. Humans walking along stopped to stare, others leapt out of the way to avoid me. Captain Pedro and Lieutenant Lanzo recognized me when I had walked close enough to wave my cap high into the air and draw their attention. They rushed towards me with unrestrained terror written across their faces.

I felt that this reaction was somewhat uncharacteristic of them. However, I would learn that my standing in public was not the cause for this reaction. I swiftly turned around to see that a human, wearing a drab selection of clothing with a black triangular hat atop his head, was standing a few paces in front of me. His eyes were full of scorn and he stood still before grunting and baring his teeth. The humans that walked along the harbor began to frantically move out of the way to avoid me and this strangely angry human. Captain Pedro and Lieutenant Lanzo then stood beside me and began relaying to me their own anger.

Captain Pedro said, ""Señor Jutta, tonto bastardo, why are you prancing around the streets? Look who you have drawn the attention of. That is Dario Vargas, a known brawler and thug working for whoever pays him enough to commit his crimes.""

The fuming man shouted, ""Captain Pedro, Perro para el Rey de España, you have only rumors and no proof that I am a brawler and a thug. I am a man who cares for his own and does as he pleases. They said a demonio was roaming this island. Now he is here. ¡Tengo la intención de cortarle la garganta! He has you all for fools acting like tal amigo. ¡Sabía que ustedes, sucios patricios, estaban en la cama con Satanás!""

The Captain shouted back, ""I would be wise not to strike him! Los duelos son ilegales and you know I can have you arrested for so much as drawing your blade!""

The man suddenly reached for something at his side and cried, ""Who said anything about a duel viejo tonto!

Just as the human was to unfurl whatever weapon, I held my breath and decided to lunge. I drew the blade given to me by the Captain and with a single swift and precise slash, the human dropped a shrunken staves. He growled and clutched his now bloody hand and stared at me in disbelief.

The crowd that had surrounded me before was now double in size. The whole section of the pathway was silent as my misdeed had likely undone all the effort I had made to appear as nonviolent and urbane.

The Captain shouted, ""Jutta, what have you done!""

Dario turned to me and cried, ""You bleed my flesh with a blade! If you have not already cursed my soul to hell then I will find you and stand alongside eleven men! ¡Te mataremos y escupiremos en tu puta tumba!""

I stamped my claws into the dry rocks beneath me and roared. The anguish that had built up over the course of the last days coursing behind every word, ""You faithless, craven, and completely irrational bruiser! Every last one of you! You see my scales, my horns, feathers, tail, and talons and immediately cower. You shield your face and stand in terror as if I somehow have sway over your souls. Weakness in all of you! So I took the mantle of strength and stood firm where no one would otherwise. Do you not think I am terrified? Do you not think that a person such as I, from a far off land with no concept of your people and your practices, suddenly thrust into the midst of them all am also not wishing to cower? But I will not because that is the shame of the Hekhadian Empire! That a kit, a quarter of the age of some of you would speak to me where others would draw a weapon instead. Gutless and savage pretenders!""

I walked towards Dario and grabbed his shirt with my claws. I then proceeded to slam the base of my horns into the cutthroat human. I then shoved him and whipped my body around, sending the thin end of my tail into his chin which sent him off his feet. I then dragged Dario into a standing position. At that time, nearly a dozen of the white uniformed humans arrived. I grunted and threw the disoriented attacker towards them.

I then shouted, ""Dario, go ahead and bring twenty men, if you could even find that many humans who wouldn't shriek and flee! I have the blessing of the Captain General, 'Don Raimundo de Montalvo'. Would any of you... any of you be so willing to act against his desires so as to harm me? That is why I reveal myself to you now! That the promises of a human, once they have been given to me, I would at the risk of my life weigh their worth.""

Padre de León, who had translated everything I had said, caused the once silent crowd to begin murmuring among one another. Captain Pedro, Lieutenant Lanzo, and Mademoiselle Geneviève were just as confounded by my declaration. Captain Pedro attempted to discipline me again; however, before he could so much as breathe, I turned to face him, my temper still at its height.

I said, ""Am I not your Ayudante de Campo? If I may be in your favor, as it is my job to offer you my wise counsel, how possibly can an alliance come forth if your people cannot bear even one of us in their midst? I understand your wish to keep me alive and well. But you are failing to realize there are tens of thousands more, some just like me and others far more strange in appearance. Within the next months, those tens of thousands will discover how you humans make oceanic craft and will make their way here with the intention to conquer. Padre de León has spoken to me, and through him I have come to realize something. All things, from this day to the next, are set against us! The secrecy and shyness is the only foolishness I have committed. For if I am not bold and quick, the farthest end of the seas will glow red with the banners of my people, and the sky will grow dark with the smoke of war. All of this and more simply because I could not remain defiant...""

""...and proclaim my humanity.""

Loonschalen; ben ik te laag geplaatst voor mijn werkzaamheden? Grafisch vormgever,werkzaken,1e4r17k,2024-07-16 11:07:48,9,0.76,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/werkzaken/comments/1e4r17k/loonschalen_ben_ik_te_laag_geplaatst_voor_mijn/,Lalalavvy,Salaris,"**Vandaag heeft mijn werkplek eindelijk een loonschaal ontwikkeld. Ik heb te horen gekregen waar ze mij in hebben gezet, en ik voel mij enorm ondergewaardeerd. Ik ben lager geplaatst dan al mijn collega's en geloof niet dat dit eerlijk is. Ik ben benieuwd in welke schaal jullie mij zouden plaatsen gebaseerd op mijn werkzaamheden en hoe ik dit kan aanpakken. Aan het einde zal ik laten weten waar ik ben geplaatst.**

Ik ben 26 jaar en werk al 3 jaar als grafisch vormgever in dit bedrijf. (hiervoor 2 jaar ergens anders) Mijn bedrijf valt onder cao retail non food. Ik ben de enige grafisch vormgever naast mijn stagiair.

**Wat ik doe:**

* Begeleiden van grafisch stagiaire (+ sollicitatie process);
* Meerdere brand books vanaf 0 ontwikkelen, incl huisstijl (logo, kleuren, fonts etc), kernwaarden, merkwaarden, tone of voice etc. Dit doe ik alleen, ik kan assistentie vragen aan collega's betreft marketing delen indien ik dit denk nodig te zijn. Ik heb dit inmiddels voor 3 van onze merken opgezet en ga er nog 2 maken;
* Bewaken van de huisstijl (soms doen/maken andere mensen op kantoor dingen die niet aansluiten op de huisstijlen, hier moet ik op letten + aanspreken / corrigeren. Zoals de content marketeer en developers);
* Bedenken van campagnes met het marketing team en zelfstandig uitwerken;
* Online ontwerpen (banners, thumbnails, infographics etc);
* Offline ontwerpen (flyers, brochures, product design etc);
* Sociale media content (posts, stories etc);
* Advertenties (social media post & story video of geanimeerde ads + krant advertenties);
* Videografie (YouTube) + in elkaar zetten;
* Illustraties voor posters en ansichtkaarten;
* UX design;
* Fotografie + bewerken (zie toelichting hieronder).

We hadden een fotograaf, haar contract is niet verlengd. Mijn collega, de klassieke 'duizendpoot' heeft dit toen opgepakt. Ze heeft weinig fotografie ervaring, ik heb dit bij mijn vorige baan wel gedaan. Ik heb haar basis dingen geleerd in photoshop voor bewerkingen en de camera uitgelegd. Product foto's doet zij, campagne fotografie doen we samen. Hiervoor doe ik alle bewerkingen etc die erna komen.

**Dit is waar ik vandaag ben geplaatst:**

'grafisch vormgever' schaal E; €15,70 p/u.

Algemeen marketeer en grafisch vormgever zitten in schaal E. Terwijl functies zoals social marketeer, content marketeer, fotograaf, email marketeer etc in F zijn geplaatst.

Mijn collega die nu deels fotograaf als functie titel heeft gekregen, zit nu een schaal hoger dan mij als grafisch vormgever. Terwijl ik ook fotografie, email (opzetten van het design), socials etc doe. Er is verder op kantoor geen enkel andere design gespecialiseerde werker, geen art director, brand manager, creative director etc. Ik ben eind verantwoordelijk voor alle design keuzes. Volgens mij doe ik zelfs wat art director gerelateerde werkzaamheden. Ik heb het gevoel dat ik enorm ondergewaardeerd wordt, te laag ben geplaatst en te weinig verdien.

Graag hoor ik jullie meningen zodat ik zeker kan zijn in mijn aankomende gesprek om dit te corrigeren. Als jullie nog andere tips hebben over hoe ik dit kan aanpakken hoor ik het graag."

**Wavelength**

Jake, Christy, and Big Deal were all sitting back chilling in VIP. They were in a nightclub called Exclusive. It was one of the hottest spots in LA! The place was packed and out of control! The bar looked like a movie shoot. The dancefloor was wild n’ crazy as a chicken coop!

Blood Gang team had ordered bottle service. The big homie, J-Dog, had already told the barmaid to take her second bottle back. They didn’t want it if it wasn’t top shelf. All the money the gang-gang was banking was like dang-dang! All the guns and drugs the gang slang-slang was like bang-bang! The DJ’s fusion of pop and hip-hop had the spot Flamin’ Hot like a bag of Cheetos.

Money over everything but loyalty. Their table was roped off and guarded by two off duty officers. Only reason they were even there, the two off duties, was because of the nightclub’s scary ass owners. In truth, nobody in their right or wrong fucking mind was sane or insane enough to try the Gang-Gang. Jake’s rep was coast-to-coast, fucking with the team was a dummy mission.

Christy had just finished rolling up a fat boy. She lit that bitch up like a bonfire and passed up. Jake took the first toke. He fell back and looked over at her like *Woah!* The blunt was strong, too strong.

The thick, pretty barmaid returned right as he passed to Christy. She put a ridiculously old bottle of Dom Perignon on the table that was stuffed in an ice bucket. When he saw that, he gave her a whole rack. She thanked him for the foolish tip and told them to just hit the pager on the table if they needed anything else.

“What up, Facebook! It’s ya boy, ICE... In the club looking real NICE... Ha! I got on my new timepiece. You already know, I had to shop and cop. This right here was mandatory. Look at the face on it... *Yeah...* that bitch blurry, ain’t it? Yeah boy, you already know... *Psych!* This ain’t no fugazi—this a custom gazey. Who you know spending a whole mill ticket on a lazy? Yeah, LA got some good ass jewelry stores. We was everywhere! Copping everything! Y’all saw us shopping! Aye, sorry ass LAPD was tailing us and shit—with they pathetic ass. They can’t do nothing. I’m untouchable! They fuck with me—they already know what time it is. I’ll have the whole Illuminati squad at the precinct, burning that bitch down! I ain’t go lie, LA starting to grow on me. Y’all killing my city. I gotta give props when props is due. I can’t lie, I was feeling so good, I even hashed it out with a few sets. We good now. I love my LA color-bangers. They showed me love—I show’d them love back. That’s all it took. That and I did bless a few sets. I mean I got so much money—why not?

“LA still raggedy than a motherfucker though—that still ain’t change. The shit’s ridiculous. How the fuck can someplace this wealthy have so many broke, sorry bastards wondering the streets? The shit’s embarrassing. I know it’s money over everything, but goddamn. We went to Hollywood to see all that glitzy shit that be one TV. Man, you can’t even walk the boulevard without a gang of broke motherfuckers begging you to bless them.

“Aye, I know dudes out here eating. Man, if I was out here, my hustle would be on Godmode. I’d have my blocks out here running like a fortune five hundred. But for real though, I know I been talking for a long ass time. What up, family? What y’all in here making it do? I’m feeling loose, shoot and I might shoot back.”

“Fuck yeah, I would!” he said before pointing the camera phone at the homey, Big Deal. “Aye, throw it up for the fam-o one time. Show 'em what we claiming.”

Big Deal threw up the set, “What it do?”

Jake laughed thuggishly while putting his arm around Christy. She threw up the set when he focused the camera on them. “My girl over here looking fine as usual.”

“Let’s pour up,” she smiled.

“Stop trying to act shy.”

“You’re crazy,” she blushed.

“Hold up, hit the pager, bae.”

“What’s wrong?” she asked him.

“Why she ain’t pour our drinks, bae? We over here looking like the twelve disciples.”

“Chill, bae, I got it.”

“You see this, family?”

“You want a drink?” she asked Big Deal before she just started pouring up all willy-nilly.

“Yeah. Good look,” he replied.

Jake threw up their gang sign. “Blood, cuz. What y’all know about having to kill to live. We do this shit for real over in my neck of the woods. Fuck with me and I won’t just slay you, I’ll snatch ya blood too.”

“And I’m always gon’ be on that vampire bs! Illuminati all day, that’s the only crime that pay!” Jake emphatically expressed before deciding to pan the camera around the room so they could see the wildness. “Look! This bitch rocking n’ rolling! They been playing my shit too, so you already know it’s an insane asylum in here! Look at the dancefloor! Look! Ha! They doing way too much!”

“Hell nah,” Christy laughed.

“I swear the club be getting extra hype when the DJ be mixing my shit,” he stated.

“Aye, bro, when they supposed to be here?” Big Deal asked him with a dash of nervousness.

“Probably in a few,” he replied.

“That’s what’s up,” Deal said.

“You ready to meet old dude?”

“Nah. Not really,” he told him.

“You shouldn’t be,” Christy said.

“Stop hating,” Jake told her.

“How am I hating?” he asked.

“You know you hating,” he told her.

“Whatever,” she told him right back.

“Aye, Facebook Family. Since y’all think I be bullshitting, I’m going to let you see these creepy bastards when they get here,” Jake declared.

Christy glared at him, “Really though?”

“Yes, really though,” he reaffirmed.

“You be doing too much,” she said.

Jake laughed at her, “Aye, my girl a beast! But when it comes to William and them, she be acting scary. I don’t know what it is or why that is, family!”

Jake could care less about some lame dude going viral behind his antics. He was incredulous if anything. He burst into laughter when he looked at the comment section, saying, “Aye! He ate off my plate, on some clown shit. Good. I’m glad he got to eat. I stay feeding niggas. Even goofy ass squares like Kevin Melvin, or whatever the fuck his name is. Tell that fuck-boy I said, grow up now that he got his money up. Hanging around kids and shit on some weirdo shit. Lame ass Blue’s Clues looking dude.”

You think I give a fuck about my reputation with the media? Fuck the news, fuck the public, fuck the kids, and most of all fuck these punk ass fake ass parents!” Jake proclaimed. He looked dead into the camera with a deadpan expression, serious as all hell as he spoke, “Do I look like a role model? That’s right, all you silly, good-for-nothing sad asses! I’m the bad guy! I’m the Big Bad Wolf! Why the fuck would the wolf apologize?! That bitch, Little Red Riding Hood, can get it!”

“Jake!” Christy groaned.

“What?” he asked.

“Chill,” she grumbled.

“I got no off switch.”

Big Deal looked over at his gang partners, and was like, “You ain’t never lied.”              

Jake gave his boy a low-five, “See, that’s why you the homey. You keep shit one hundred.”

Christy expressed her sourness, “Yeah, but honesty ain’t always the best policy.”

Jake gave all the trolls in his livestream the middle finger and then stated, “I do this rap shit for fun. I can do what I want and say what I want. I got my money outta the gutta. I’m dope boy rich! Why the fuck would I care what Joe Blow’s parents think? I’m gon’ bag, and tag, and rag, and throw the Blood Gang-Gang flag until I’m motherfucking blue in the motherfucking face! Snitch on the ops for *2* soups! Woot! Woot!” Jake laughed. He hit the blunt and said, “I’m fooling right now, fam. I can’t even lie, blame this good ass weed. And this crisp ass drank. Shit got me slanted on the cross like Judas! Vote for me as y’all next president, and I promise to keep the streets flooded! Ha! Think about it, my fellow Americans.

There was so much fire on the roof. The DJ scratched and mixed one of Jake’s tracks into ashes! He leaned into the microphone, slowed down the mix with that ultra-low fix and announced: “I got a special one for you guys. Something exclusive for Club Exclusive! It’s one of Jake’s songs, but I bet you’ve never heard it. Shhh... You know how I do; how I always do! I got more work than a company! Welcome to my wild world, it’s ya boy, DJ SK77!”

*“You can drug deal too... Just do it like me. You can body peel too... Just do it like me. You can fuck a bad bitch too... Just do it like me. Slide off that stripper pole then slide on my pole.*

*“Jake, how you do it? First of all, I got it out the mud, then I got a plug. Savage mode, yeah, I fill 'em up with slugs. Send 'em up above when I took over the Dirty Glove. It’s a dirty game, it’s a dirty shame, you dirty niggas so lame. I can’t complain, I came in here with a lil change. These hoes change when they see the fame. It’s J-ICE, yeah that boy nice, I throw cash up like wedding rice. I got no ones, I got no fives, I got no tens; only tossing twenties, fifties, and a whole gang ah hundreds. Girl, gon’ shake that ass if you want this cash. Girl, shake that ass, you know I want some. Girl, shake that ass if you want this lump sum.*

*“Homeboy, I’m hot, nigga you not! I really came from dem slums. I’m really stacking up dem funds. Throwing drug money at this bad honey. Getting’ blood money, keeping’ dem streets runny. Got dem strippers in the club—like rain-rain, please don’t go away. Make it rain-rain all day. They love me cause I always come and play. Damn I love blowing off some steam. I go choo choo when she gimme brain. Now she tryin’ na hop on my Thomas The Train.*

*“Niggas be in here saving hoes like the Justice League. I’m in here slaying hoes, I’m in my own league. Love it when she throw that ass like a kickback. Fresh out the hood like a stimpak. Broke niggas hating—tell 'em get back. Weed smell so sesame like a Big Mac.*

*“I got work if you need that. She got that back, I got that fee, I call that feedback. Yeah, she infatuated with my style, she say she love that. She say I’m ruff and rugged. Came up from dez slums—serving up dez bums. I-bet you-can’t-do-it-like-me. Nope! I-bet you-can’t-do-it-like-me. Damn... Getting’ Green Eggs and Ham, like Sam-I-Am! What? Okay—okay, here we go—* 

*Getting money by the truckload! Getting cain (cocaine) by the boatload! Got a dock for the unload. More metal than a railroad. My story still untold... Yeah! Murder game so out cold. When it come to gunplay, I’m MJ with that fadeaway. When to come to the strip club, I came! And I give a whole duffle bag away. Yikes!”*

The DJ spun the track retarded—on some Forrest Gump shit. The people crowding the dancefloor were animated like an anime. It was pandemonium! You could feel the walls shake! You could feel the floor earthquake! The flow was poetry, divine like rosery! Bang! Bang! Boom! His song damn near tore the roof off that bitch!

He pointed over at Jake and announced, “Shout-out to the big homey, ICY! Shout-out to Blood Gang! I see you over there holding it down! I hope LA been good to you. Swear to God, guy got a stack of money on the table. Table so cloudy it looks like they’re floating on Mr. Popo’s magic carpet! It’s DJ SK77—I’ll be melting the floor until last call! Let’s go! If you got money to get than get it! If you already getting it than keep getting it!”

Jake threw up his gang sign after hopping from his booth. He went over to the edge of the platform that separated VIP from the dancefloor. Then he tossed a bunch of blue faces down on the pale faces below—who were partying and dancing the night away. They went bananas! They scooped up the money like it was candy falling from a busted pinata. Jake returned to his booth and had one of his bodyguards put ten thousand on top of the DJ’s workstation. He laughed joyously, while watching the pandemonium from his throne. He glanced over at Deal and saw him trying to hide his amusement.

Christy wasn’t having it. “That song was ignorant!”

“Huh? What I do, bae?!” he asked all surprised.

“Why would you make a song like that?” she asked.

“Bro, I swear!” Jake leaned over and tried to appeal to his homey, “Tell her! That ain’t me! She don’t know what she talking about—do she?!”

Big Deal just shook his head.

“Tell her, bro!” Jake pleaded.

“Stop lying!” Christy snapped.

\*    \*    \*     \*

Just then, while Christy was chiding her boyfriend for his antics, William and company came through the back door. The doorman came over and whispered politely into Jake’s ear that his guests had arrived. Dude could barely see, there was so much haze from all the weed smoke.

William sat down next to Jake. Marie sat in between Christy and Annabelle. Big Deal was sitting by Annabelle, across from his homey Jake and William, who were chilling on the other side of the table like bosses.

Jake showed William some love before introducing him to the homey, Big Deal. “This my captain.”

William gave him a nod. “Greetings.”

Big Deal nodded back, “What it do?”

Jake blurted, “That’s my dude. Oh, I don’t know if you know—him and Christy go way back, I’m talking yee-high. I don’t know if you can hear me, it’s crazy in the club right now. They just played one of my joints.”

“We’re vampires, I can here you.”

“Tch, I keep forgetting,” Jake stated.

“I understand. The transition takes some time to get used to,” William assured him.

“Fo sho,” Jake replied.

William introduced his fiancée and her friend, Annabelle, to Big Deal. When he did this, Marie looked over at Annabelle, and she in turn looked at her, before the two began snickering like sneaky schoolgirls. Their laughter was more contemptuous than playful. William had had the nerve to introduce this obviously inferior human.

Marie rolled her eyes and said, “As if I’d actually say ‘Hi’ to a human subservient to Jake.”

“Oh my, Anne,” Anna chortled.

Jake didn’t waste no time. He propped an arm up on William’s shoulder and panned the camera on them. Joyous as hell, he exclaimed, “Aye! This the major homie, Big Will. Yeah, that’s right—y’all thought I was lying! I told you, I know them people who *really* know them people! Go head, Big Will, throw up that Illuminati gang sign.”

“We don’t have a gang sign,” he said.

“Aye, Christy, bae, fire up a blunt.”

“I got you,” she told boo.

“What’d you mean, you ain’t got no gang signs? Every gang got a gang sign,” Jake told William.

“We’re not a gang,” he replied.

Christy fired up a fat boy. She looked over at Anna and asked, “You ever smoked reefer?”

Marie told Anna, “Marijuana.”

“Oh, *marijuana.* No. never.”

Marie shrugged. “Yeah. It’s one of those frugal drugs urbanites like to abuse for some reason.”

Anna shrugged too, “I’ll try it.”

Marie laughed, “You’ll be fine.”

Marie took the blunt and placed it in front of Anna’s lips. She told her to make sure she inhaled, or it wouldn’t be a good enough draw to be particularly effective at getting her buzzed. Anna took a toke and immediately began coughing uncontrollably. Unphased, she took another toke, still coughing and everything.

Marie laughed at her for being such a try-hard. Then she hit the blunt her own damn self, drawing in three major length tokes without coughing a lick. After calmly clearing her throat, she passed to Christy.

“You’re a pro,” Christy said.

“I am *so* not,” Marie responded.

“Yeah you are,” Christy smiled.

“Anyways,” Marie blushed.

Jake blurted out, “Yeah, she got them iron lungs from all the drugs she smoked!”

“Excuse me?” Marie asked.

“You heard what I said.”

“Fuck off!” Marie snapped.

Jake put the camera on her and then spoke to his followers. “This the lil ditzy chick I be telling y’all about. Not the blonde one. The one with the curly hair. Yeah, she the one. She over everything.”

“Why are you filming them?” Christy asked.

“What’re you nagging about now?” he asked.

“How do you know they want to be on camera?”

Jake rolled his eyes and groaned, “Ugh. You care if I film y’all, Marie?”

“What is this, Facebook?”

“Yeah,” he answered.

“Sure,” she told him.

“You guys not on social media? I tried to look you up and nothing came up.” Christy said.

“We’re not allowed,” Marie said.

“Why not?” Jake asked.

“It would make finding us rudimentary. If you haven’t noticed, we have quite a few enemies,” Marie spoke.

Christy gave Jake a scornful look. “You heard that? They not on social media because it draws too much attention. Maybe you can learn a thing or two?”

“Whatever,” Jake dismissed her carefulness as fearfulness. He still had the camera aimed at Marie while continuing his simpleminded line of questioning. “Who?”

“Who what?” Marie asked.

“Who said y’all can’t?”

“Uh. No one,” she frowned.

“What do you mean?” he asked.

“It’s an unspoken rule for what I would hope are obvious reasons,” she explained.

“They don’t believe you, Marie,” Jake said.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

“They think you lying about being a vampire.”

“So what?” she told him.

“You ain’t got no way to prove it?” he asked.

“No,” she quickly replied.

“No?” he quickly inquired.

“I could care less what your followers think.”

“Do it for me,” he told her.

“Bah!” she laughed and struck the table, telling him, “How about you make yourself useful and order us a more appropriate drink?”

“Why? What’s wrong with what we got already? You know how much that bottle cost?” he asked.

“We don’t care for Dom Pérignon.”

“Hell nah,” Big Deal muttered.

“What do you prefer?” Christy asked.

“It doesn’t matter,” Marie said.

“Ok,” Christy said before hitting the pager.

The barmaid was over there in record time. She smiled and welcomed Marie and Annabelle, before asking how she could help. Christy thought about it for a minute. She looked over at Marie and her friend and pondered what to order for them. She knew Marie a bit too well and was quick to hold her tongue in fear of being insulted.

Jake wasn’t so thoughtful. He could care less about what the pampered princess thought. He winked at the thick barmaid and told her, “Aye, baby girl, grab us one of them gold bottles. It don’t matter which one it is, as long as it cost more than what you make in a month.”

“No problem, Mr. Winters. Anything else?” she asked.

Jake pointed the camera at the table, showing off the pile of money. “Look at that. Remember when I tossed all that cash on the dancefloor? Yeah, well, look at it, now; I still got all this money left!”

The beat switched up on some sudden shit. Jake was too into a groove to tell the barmaid to carry on. She took the hint and told him that she would be right back with his order. Jake raised his hand and gangster leaned. Smoke, money, champagne; sex, murder, and fame. The bloke had it all, but “all” simply wasn’t enough. “The World Is Yours,” and he was willing to die for it.

He rapped along to the song the DJ was mixing. The whole nightclub was hype. It was another one of ICY’s tracks unheard until now. Looking dead into the camera, at the Facebook Family he started up:

“If I pray to God, it’s only for a bag. You thinking hell nah, I’m thinking nah hell not bad. We rep the same blood-drenched flag. Got your girl loose like Lucifer. Flow hot like my booster. On God, she say *“Ooh”* when I do it to her. Who knew I had that vampire voodoo? Pack pushing pigeon back like a tutu.

“I keep a drum like a drummer. My haters dumb, my foes dumber. I hit her bum from the back like *bummer.* I make her hum like a *hummer.* Turned the slums into a whole lot of sums. Them niggas is them Hot Boys... and them blocks hot off the drizzle. Them pots hot off the sizzle. Them niggas is them what? *Hot Boys...* fried off the fizzle.” 

Jake nearly laughed himself out of his seat after he finished rapping! The only thing that prevented him from falling over was William’s arm, which he rudely crashed into. He wiped the tears of joy and amusement from his eyes, and said, “My bad, Will-Dog.”

Big Deal and Christy looked at him like he was the most ignorant person in the world. Jake picked up the blunt and took a dumbass, long ass toke. He held on to that puppy for so long he nearly passed out. He passed that puppy off to William and to Big Deal’s shock, William hit that puppy like the repo man. He even went so far as to swish smoke around in his mouth before exhaling.

Marie knew what he was thinking. With a frown, she told this “Big Deal” character, “It’s hard to believe, I know. Someone supposedly so terrifying, engaging in something so pedestrian.”

“I ain’t saying nothing. That’s his business,” Big Deal told her.

Marie told Anna, “This is what I must deal with. A fuddled fiancé.”

“You’re one to speak,” William stated.

“Hey, Anne, what do you think of the bar maiden?” Anna asked Marie.

“Meh. Torture?” she replied.

“I’m surprised. I thought for sure you’d say ‘kill,’” Anna stated.

“Meh. I like for my victims to be a certain weight. Anything over, let’s say one hundred and seventy pounds, and the blood starts to taste tart.”

“For women, right?” Anna asked.

“Right,” Marie confirmed.

“Ah. That’s what the nightshade’s for,” Anna replied.

“Yeah, but it only seems to work on male victims. The human female takes far too long to perish. The wait can be totally agonizing,” Marie explained.

Anna blushed wildly. She could feel the stares without even looking. She simply shrugged, luckily the barmaid was back. She popped the cork on another stupidly expensive bottle of champagne. A bottle of vintage Louis Roederer. She filled Anna and Anne’s cups. Then she jammed the bottle into the ice bucket. Marie took one sip and found herself greatly annoyed. Her smug expression would have been impossible to hide even if she tried.

“Is everything ok?” the barmaid asked.

Marie grabbed her and Anna’s cup, before Anna could even take a sip. She handed them back to the barmaid and told her in the snootiest tone imaginable to “Bring back something more desirable. It was bad enough they were forced to dwell amongst undesirables. The last thing she wanted was to drink like one. Their stench... it was especially odious on the dancefloor.”

“Sorry, ma’am, do you have any—""

“Be off already!” Marie barked.

“Damn, well excuse me for trying,” the barmaid angrily mumbled under her breath, all rudely.

“What’d you say, human?” Marie asked.

William gestured for the barmaid to “come to him.” He intervened in order to keep things from turning bloody. When she did so, he leaned over and whispered into her ear. She nodded along. Before walking off to fulfill his request, she told him, “I like the way you think.”

“What did you request?” Marie asked.

“You’ll find out soon enough.”

“I beg your pardon, my dear?”

“Patience is a virtue,” he explained.

“Look at you, sharing words of wisdom with Anne,” Anna tittered while covering her mouth.

“I don’t know about wise?” Marie said.

“It was sapient the least,” Anna said.

“Officious vampires usually are.”

“Oh, Anne, that’s so mean,” Anna said.

“So, what up, Marie?” Jake blurted.

“What do you want?” she asked.

“What’s good with you my blood sucker from another mother! What it do, roadie?” Jake laughed.

Anna clapped, “Priceless! Simply priceless!” She laid her head on Marie’s shoulder and said, “Oh devil! I love you, Anne! You always surround yourself with interesting characters. This gunsel is the best!”

“Hell nah,” Big Deal muttered.

“You tripping,” Christy told Anna.

“Fuck with me for a minute, Marie.”

“I’m listening,” she told Jake.

“Tell my followers about the Illuminati.”

“The Illuminati?” She asked him.

“Yeah. The Illuminati.”

“Is that what they call us?” Anna asked.

“I don’t know, you tell me,” Jake said.

“I suppose you could call it that,” she smiled.

“Aye, family, I don’t know why they over here playing coy. Like they don’t run the Illuminati.”

William chimed in, “Hmm... that’s a very interesting deduction, my friend. And why again is it you assume we are in charge of this supposed organization?”

“William, bro. Man, stop playing—I already know you in the Illuminati. It’s just a matter of how far up you niggas are on the food chain,” Jake stated.

“Well, if that’s the case, I suppose I’m pretty high up there on the ‘food chain,’” Marie said.

“Like how far though. Give me an example,” Jake said.

“Let me see... hmm... I’m not all the way at the top, but I am pretty far up there. Ok, put it like this. I’ve yet to actually sip from the unholy grail, but I have come dangerously close. Ugh. That’s a terrible example. Mm. Put it this way, I’ve never tasted the actual cake, but I have put my finger on the frosting. And I must say, the ‘Illuminati’ makes awfully good frosting.”

“Oh, what flavor?” Anna asked.

“Medlar?” Marie replied.

“Nice!” Anna chortled.

“You guys are strange,” Christy said."
I've done and fuck up! chapter 50 part 2 ,HFY,1e3f1ic,2024-07-14 18:39:07,17,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1e3f1ic/ive_done_and_fuck_up_chapter_50_part_2/,VICXIII,OC,"[Discord ](https://discord.gg/jQrdpnwGux)

[Story wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/ive_done_and_fuck_up/)

After bathing a naughty pup and a comb over, Gabriel found himself alongside his new dog in the section of the Command Center dedicated to the Healers of the Mind. Walking through the giant branch and passing several Main Units, several crew members and Healers of the Mind stare puzzlingly at the Champion before them and the annoyed, if not displeased, furry creature resting on top said Champion. Thousands, if not millions, of thoughts ran across the minds of the crew members and Healers of the Mind who saw the puzzlingly yet cute display before them. Some chuck it up to a unique quirk of Gabriel's. Others thought it might be a ritual related to “Human” culture. But all ended up in the same conclusion: it was a Gabriel thing. As more and more crew members and Healer of the Mind saw Gabriel, word of his arrival got to the ears of 2 individuals.

“Gab\`riel, notlà zoht zintlé cuà lli to nallì.”

Turning to the old Litigron cradle tongue greeting, Gab\`riel saw one of his mates, Syl’vainette.

“Good morning to you, too, Sylvi, ***mi luz de luna***. Aren’t you a bit too early for your shift? You don’t start for another hour.”

Syl’vainette approached Gab\`riel and smiled when she heard him calling her by the endearing name he had given her.

“I do, but oddly enough, I couldn’t sit still in my Burrow. I feel full of energy, even after the double shift I took yesterday.”

“That’s probably because of the food I made you. It was a balance between fats that were easy to digest and bark that slowly released vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that help with Essence distribution once it hit your digestive tract. But that doesn’t mean you have to overwork yourself. Everyone here is doing their best to help those who need it. Trust them; you and I know they’ll do fine even if you take a break.”

Syl’vainette felt at odds hearing Gab\`riel words. A part of her, deep down, was telling her that Gab\`riel was trying to control her just like her “parents,” that her wishes did not matter, that she was only a tool for him to control. But she quickly stomps those thoughts down. Gab\`riel would never do that; his words were from a place of worry and care. Yes, at the very beginning, she felt that way. But as time passed, their time spent together was beautiful and insightful. Gab\`riel

never gave her the familiar stare of pity she got from others or the feeling of detest she got in the higher echelons of the Empire for not having a tail or being tall. No, what she got from him was curiosity, the need to learn, to see what she liked: her favorite color, food, music, stories—in-depth analysis of the Empire's House's politics, debates on obscure topics such as first contacts. Gab\`riel was the complete opposite of what she was taught when she was forced to be a “male” of the Empire. He wanted to know her before they became one with the Maiden Sigil. Even though she tried to take the lead as any other female would and mate with him. In the most crucial moments, she was hit by one of her most painful memories of her “parents” lesson when she tried to undress Gab\`riel and ended up shaking in fear. Gab\`riel didn’t leave her and didn’t lose respect for her when she was in a vulnerable state. He waited until the shaking stopped before he asked if she needed to see Zè. She couldn’t reply, but she shook her head to answer. Gab\`riel made the call, waited for Zè to arrive, and left, giving them space to talk. After the session and the following day, Gab\`riel told her not to force herself. That he would give her all the time she needed; after all, a relationship, as he put it, is more than just about fucking. Yet she wanted it to happen. She wanted to finally be free of the last of her remaining pieces of her “parents.” To finally be herself and once again feel Gab\`riel’s lips on her flesh.

“What are you thinking that got you smiling like that?”

Gab\`riel said as he gently moved aside a strand of mane from Syl’vainette’s face. But when he realized what he had done, he quickly pulled his whole arm back.

“Sorry about that, Silvi.”

Gab\`riel’s words brought Syl’vainette out of her thoughts, and she saw Gab\`riel pulling his massive left paw away. Yet seeing his massive paw overshadowing her brought no memory of her “mother,” “father,” or other “teachers” trying to teach her. What she saw was Gab\`riel worrying about her and being concerned for her. Garbing his paw, Syl’vainette pulled it closer to her face and gently placed his palm on her cheek.

“It's fine, Gab\`riel. You don’t have to apologize. I’m okay now; I’m doing better than okay, thanks partly to Zè's help and the people here. And you are right, I shouldn’t overword myself. But that applies to you, too. You are working nonstop. I know you don’t sleep or need to rest, but even you have a limit.”

Gab\`riel was surprised but faster than anything in the Empire could process, he was able to recover and smile.

“I am happy for you, and if you need anything, I am always here. Just take your time to heal. I’m going nowhere.”

Gab\`riel said while he gently caressed Syl’vainette’s right cheek.

“There is something you can help me with, Gab\`riel. Something I wanted to do for a while now.”

Syl’vainette’s eyes glitter, looking up at Gab\`riel. Gab\`riel only smiled back but jumped with[ \~joy\~](https://media.giphy.com/media/5GoVLqeAOo6PK/giphy.gif?cid=790b76112or5wzai1ey2yxwox651dqnee9nyh3v5er4u301m&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) inside his mind, seeing Syl’vainette overcome those horrible events from her past.

“Tell me, what do you need me to do?”

He asked, genuinely happy. Syl’vainette didn’t answer. She simply pulled Gab\`riel closer and kissed him. Gab\`riel placed his arms around Syl’vainette’s waist, pulled her in closer, and both began kissing each other passionately.

“Awoo\~ are you done? I got better things to do than seeing you swapping saliva.”

The passionate and steamy kiss that Syl’vainette and Gab\`riel were enjoying was cut short thanks to the fluffy creature resting on top of Gab\`riel’s head.

“***Dogs are supposed to be wingmen to men; you’re supposed to be men’s best friends! Why the fuck are you cockblocking me!?”***

Gab\`riel said through gritted teeth as he pulled away from Syl’vainette.

“I have meant to ask you, Gab\`riel, what or who is on your shoulders?”

Syl’vainette asks, puzzling and with a raised eyebrow.

“This here is ***Colonel Churro***, and to the “what,” His species is called a canaryne in the cradle tongue of this world, and he is very similar to what Humans domesticated thousands of years ago to be their pets and hunting partners, which is called a ***dog***. Come, ***Churro***, say hi.”

Gab\`riel said while he petted the fluffy creature's side.

“Awoo\~I am the great one that stands above all, given the name Churro by Big Mama Egillene and tasked with assisting this big muscle head. You can pet me once, and I am hungry. You can feed me. Those other Tierische Männchen did not feed me well. Awoo\~”

“You forgot to add modest, Gab\`riel.”

Syl’vainette said with amusement, hearing the fluffy creature named Shairro speak in the Common Tongue.

“Yeah, that is something I got to work on. Alongside him, understanding that I was the one that named him and not Egillene.”

Gab\`riel reply.

Syl’vainette laughed, seeing how the last sentence Gab\`riel said was in the Common Tongue and clearly meant to Shairro.

“Awoo\~ You can’t name me muscle, as this great name could never come out of such brain made out of muscles, Awoo\~.”

Churro said while smacking the top of Gab\`riel’s head with his paw. Syl’vainette laughed, seeing what was happening before her. It is evident that Shairro was trying hard to annoy Gab\`riel, but it didn’t faze Gab\`riel whatsoever.

“Enough of that, Churro. I have got to go now. Silvi, can you please look after this guy, give him some food, and drop him off at Yesleta’s burrow?”

Gab\`riel asks as he picks Churro off his shoulders and places him on the floor.

“Of course. Is there any specific type of food you want me to give him?”

Syl’vainette asked while she began to pet the top of Churro’s head.

“His test results and what Egillene, guardian of the north root, say they can pretty much eat anything. Give him the items I just sent to your tablet.”

Moving her paw away from Churro’s head, Syl’vainette grabbed her tablet and scrolled down the list of items. In total, Shairro would be eating 10 lbs of Sovàllat meat and bark mixture. Clipping her tablet back in place, Syl’vainette turns to Gab\`riel.

“I’ll make sure he eats, and Gab\`riel, I know you are going to be busy with the construction of the new Emperor's Wish, but is it possible to make some time for what you call a Dh-te?”

Syl’vainette said with some hope in her eyes.

“But of course, I can make time for you, ***mi luz de luna.*** How about tonight? Are you free?”

Gab\`riel replied with honey words.

Yes, of course, I’m free tonight! Where do you want to meet?”

Syl’vainette replied while she jumped with joy and excitement in her voice.

“How about the northeast of the Command center? You know the new Rec Unit? one that overlooks the lake?”

Gab\`riel quickly came up with his idea for a date night.

“Yes, I know it! How about we meet there at 22:00?”

Syl’vainette replies excitedly.

“Then it's a ***date***. I’ll see you there, ***mi luz de luna***. But for now, I will leave you with this. I hope that is enough for now; there will be more later tonight.”

Gab\`riel said while grabbing Syl’vainette’s left paw and kissing the back of it.

“Awoo\~ are you going to mate? This place is terrible for mating, Awoo\~”

Churro sat in front of Gab\`riel and Syl’vainette and cutely moved his head. Gab\`riel sighed. He couldn’t be mad at him. He was too adorable, even if his way of speaking was that of an ass.

“No, we are not going to mate here. I need to teach you how to talk properly. I will see you later, ***mi luz de luna***. I don’t want to make Zè wait long.”

“Gab\`riel, aren’t you forgetting something?”

Gab\`riel looked puzzled, hearing Syl’vainette’s words, but it was only for a very short moment that he remembered what she meant.

“Ah, right, ***Celia***. I wouldn’t be able to complete my session without her. Thank you, Silvi; I’ll go and pick her up.”

“There is no need, Notlà zoht zintlé.”

Gab\`riel looked at Syl’vainette, waiting for her to explain what she meant, but saw that she placed her index and thumb fingers in her lips and whistled loudly. Soon, two mystical lights began to descend. The lights swoop down and stop before Gab\`riel and Syl’vainette. Reaching the light before him, with his palm open, Gab\`riel saw it dim, replaced by a phoenix-like creature that gave off a faint[ \~glow\~](https://imgur.com/r1H69Ab).

“Hello, ***Celia***. How are you, girl?”

The phoenix-like creature sang in reply with a beautiful tone.

“Se lià had been staying with Holimerti, my own Spak’rie. They have been getting along that they leave the Healer of the Mind care and nest together.”

Syl’vainette said as she petted a male Spak’rie with red feathers.

“You sure work fast, little one, but I am happy to know you got a partner to roost with. Many of you little guys didn’t make it when we crashed landed. I’ll see you tonight, Syl’vainette, and don’t forget we met at 22:00 at the new Rec Unit.”

Gab\`riel said as he placed Celia on his left shoulder and turned to Syl’vainette.

“I won’t forget, and maybe Goddess Uctetrine's guidance light the path to your healing, Notlà zoht zintlé.”

Syl’vainette replied while she intertwined her fingers with Gab\`riel and got close for one last kiss. Parting ways, Gab\`riel began making his way to Zè while Syl’vainette stood looking at his massive back.

“You're hungry, correct?”

Syl’vainette turns to Churro and asks in the Common Tongue.

“Awoo\~ of course, Awoo\~ the Tierische Männchen fail to feed the great me. Awoo\~ They need to be taught a lesson on treating guess right, Awoo\~.”

Syl’vainette laughed at the odd yet cute way the fluffy creature spoke in the Common Tongue.

“Then, if you follow me, I can give you a feast that will be befitting for someone as great as you.”

“Awoo\~ you have excellent manners. Lead the way, Awoo\~.”

Churro replied, standing up from his hind legs and beginning to wage his fluffy tail excitedly. Syl’vainette started walking in the opposite direction of Gab\`riel, seeking the items he had sent her. Churro walked beside her, waging his tail vigorously. Above them, Holimerti flew, singing with its beautiful voice.

Ranking the Bowser's Inside Story Bosses,marioandluigi,1e3dclg,2024-07-14 17:28:03,3,0.57,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marioandluigi/comments/1e3dclg/ranking_the_bowsers_inside_story_bosses/,LarryBetraitor,Discussion,"BIS is overrated. Not bad, but overrated. It's carried by the story, but the level design isn't the best, it's also the most mechanically flawed game in the series ranging from a bad but optional Fire Flower to annoying and required broken inhale buttons and bad touchscreen minigames, it's easier than Superstar Saga (a game everyone THINKS is easy), and yes... even though the bosses are good, they aren't exactly this game's strong suit. The OG Version on the DS is so glazed that people tend to trash the objectively superior remakes that are better in almost every way and fix most of the original's problems. I can see why people like... or even LOVE the game, but I will never understand why this game is the fan favorite, especially if we're talking about the OG.

However, something that Mario & Luigi has ALWAYS been great at are the bosses! Combat may not be a high point in BIS, but the bosses are still worth fighting and the game is still worth playing. I will be ranking the bosses from worst to best.

**RULES!**

1. Yes, I will be including Tutorial Bosses and Giant Bosses. They may not play boss music, but they're required AND you don't fight them as regular enemies. No, I will not be including the SockHops.
2. My most recent playthrough was a Grindless Run where you avoid all the enemies so you get to fight the bosses at their full potential. Please, keep this in mind. Not only is this the optimal way to play BIS, but it's also the best way to TRULY appreciate the difficulty of the bosses. For this reason, the Shroobs will not be included on this list. (But in case you're wondering, they would be above the Durmite but below the Scutlet. For an optional boss, it's disappointingly easy, and so simple that it's BORING!)
3. No, I will not be including the X Bosses except for Bowser X, because my reasoning would just be, ""It's just previous boss but better.""

*Now, before we begin our ranking, I would like to formally apologize to The Dark Star. Last time I made a ranking like this, I have slandered it by besmirching it with the defamatory statement of ""It's too easy"". Such ridiculous defamation! The Dark Star is actually the HARDEST boss in the entire series! Bowser X? Antasma X? Dream Team Bowser Jr? Pfft, such child's play! Even with Mario & Luigi at 3 Billion, the Dark Star is unbeatable. Nobody can beat this game without hacking. It's IMPOSSIBLE!*  
🌟If you want my actual thoughts, the Dark Star would be above Wiggler but below Midbus because the fight is too easy, even on a grindless run. At least Dark Star X is a good battle. I hope The Dark Star can't read Light Stars.✨

**Without further ado, LETSA GO!**

# Lightning Round

24. Beginner Bowser  
23. Manual Midbus  
22. Broque Monsiur  
21. Broggy  
20. Chakron

No, I don't need to explain why all the tutorial bosses are at the bottom of the list. If you've played any... ANY video game at all, the explaining has already been done.

Instead, I'd like to mention that the tutorial bosses are actually better in the 3Ds Remake than they are in the OG. Why? Because... get this... the remake doesn't bother you with Toadsworthless. You actually get to PLAY THE GAME, and all the tedious guide stuff is in the guide... where it BELONGS! Take notes, OG! Also, take notes EVERY OTHER GAME!

# 19. Blizzard Midbus

I see this boss get glazed SO MUCH! One of the most criminally overrated bosses I've ever seen. A great example of style over substance. Really? THIS is one of the best bosses in Mario & Luigi? Gimme a break!

Right off the bat, this boss is a major HP sponge, which is already annoying in and of itself. The attacks are boring and uncreative. It's just THROWING SNOWBALLS! Like... really? Would it have KILLED them to recycle some moves from the other Midbus battles? That wouldn't be so bad, until you realize that he also comes with a GIANT snowball with a BOB-OMB in it! In theory, it would be a fun attack, because you have to memorize where the Bob-Omb is and PUNCH IT! **In reality, there's no memorization. There's just luck! No matter how good you are at paying attention, you always have to punch randomly, which takes away from a core element of Mario & Luigi... you know... the RPG that favors SKILL over LUCK?!**

If you think that's bad...? That was just the REMAKE! The OG is WAY more annoying with this boss. I haven't even mentioned the Snawfuls! Remember when I said that the OG was mechanically flawed? One of the major, MAJOR mechanical flaws of the OG is that the inhale button doesn't work properly. It has poor programming. No matter how fast you have to mash the X button, it STILL doesn't work all the way, which means the Snawfuls will HEAL and DEF-BUFF the Blizard Midbus, making the fight longer and more annoying than it already is!

***No, this is not a ""me problem"" or a ""skill issue""! I have tried this on MULTIPLE DS and 3DS systems.***  
Thankfully, there's an easier way to get around this issue in the OG. Mashing the X button isn't enough, because you ALSO have to mash Y at the same time. This makes the OG a much more tolerable game to play... BUT THE GAME NEVER TELLS YOU THIS! It took me... SEVEN YEARS to figure this out! I am not even joking!

A Grindless Purist would just fight Blizzard Midbus and the Snawfuls in the 3Ds Remake without the help of Mario and Luigi to minimize EXP. I ain't doing that. The fight is annoying enough as is! They don't even level up, just USE MARIO AND LUIGI FOR YOUR OWN SANITY!

# 18. Alpha & Beta Kretin

In concept, a boss in Red and Green could be fun. A boss where Mario fights Red and Luigi fights Green? So many creative possibilities could ensue! What if they change colors mid-attack in order to bait you? Oh, what if the Green Kretins look like they're ramming themselves into Mario, only to BAIT AGAIN and jump over you? What if they had OPPOSITE MODE?!

Sadly, this fight isn't any good. They only have ONE ATTACK! Oh, I'm sorry... TWO attacks, with the second attack being just as boringly easy as the first one being only limited to the Beta form. It's not difficult, it's not challenging, it's just annoying and sluggish. Even if you're a high level, the fight will still last longer than it needs to be.

The X fight isn't much better. You don't even have to pay attention to the real boss in the second phase because you now have attacks that wipe out the clones, but at least the boss fight is over quicker.

# 17. Durmite

They say ""Early game bosses don't have to suck. They don't have to be piss easy, because they are allowed to have challenge"". For the most part, Durmite succeeds at exactly that.

Unfortunately, there's a small but MAJOR flaw that stops this fight from being good. That is... the straw... such an annoying mechanic! The boss fight is already challenging for an early game boss, but they go overboard with this stupid straw that heals and heals and heals some more. As SOON as you're done with the straw, Durmite pulls out another one, and another one, and another one until you eventually run out of BP and have to waste a turn with a Syrup jar, only to waste all your attacks and it heals anyway.

>""Ugh, such is the epitome of all 'you problems' and 'skill issues'! If the boss is really that hard, you can just grind! It's not even that hard!""

And you'd be right! Except... unlike other bosses... this one has an issue the rest don't have... you see... ***YOU CAN'T GRIND!***  
That's right! There is NO WAY to fight more enemies. Bowser is stuck, there's no Pipe Zone, the Pump Works is closed off because BOWSER IS STUCK, so the Trash Pit is the only place you can go... except the enemies are to weak to be grind-able! You can't just get more money to buy better gear and items, and you only have a certain amount of coins. Once your coins are gone, they're GONE!

That means you have three options.

1. Tediously fight weak enemies to grind for pennies and morsels of EXP. This method takes AGES! It takes so long that it might as well not even count as grinding.
2. Fight the Durmite at the current weak state that you're stuck with and hope it doesn't use the straw.
3. SHUT OFF THE GAME AND DELETE YOUR SAVES!

Boss battles should NOT have to be designed like this. You should not have to be trapped and completely helpless. This isn't just a bad boss, it's faulty game design. Even the 3Ds Remake is guilty of this.  
The X Boss is better than the regular Durmite because you have more Bros. Attacks, and get this... YOU CAN GRIND! Even going in grindless, Durmite X STILL isn't as annoying to fight as the regular Durmite.

# 16. Scutlet

While not as annoying as the Durmite, it has the opposite problem. It's too boring and easy. The only entertaining part is getting to hit Starlow.

>""My guy, Scutlet is an early game boss. What were you expecting?!""

This is a lame excuse. Early game bosses don't have to suck. In fact, we JUST got done fighting a much better boss!  
***THE SEA PIPE STATUE!***

So even if we use the ""eArLy GaMe BoSsEs ArE sUpPoSeD tO sUcK"" excuse, that excuse is INSTANTLY defeated because of the Sea Pipe Statue. ***Please, do yourself and ALL OF US a favor and stop making excuses for why things ""have"" to suck.***

# 15. Sea Pipe Statue

Finally, we're at the bosses that don't completely suck! 

The Sea Pipe Statue is an example of early game bosses DONE RIGHT! It doesn't have to suck, it doesn't have to be bland, it just has to set the tone for the rest of the game.

I like how customizable the fight is. If you fight it with Bowser alone, only counterattacks will work. If you fight it with the bros, you can attack the Stone Blooper directly, but it will also deal required damage to Bowser.

The next time you see someone making a bad take like:

>iT's An EaRlY gAmE bOsS! wHaT wErE yOu ExPeCtInG?!

Show them this boss... or Dreamy Mario... or Petey Piranha... heck, even Hohoros will work!

# 14. Wiggler

We might get tired of obligatory Wiggler fights because they are the most ""OK"" fights in the series. And you know what? This fight is okay.

Obviously with this being a Wiggler fight, it's not gonna be very special. Nobody's gonna look at this and say, ""oH bOy! My FaVoRiTe BoSs In MaRiO & lUiGi!"" But it does have some redeeming qualities. You don't just brute-force your way through with your strongest attack ever, you have to take your time with your punches.  
The Leaf Guys offer some customization in this battle. You can fight them as Mario and Luigi, or if you're on a grindless run, you can take some required damage from the turnip to make the fight more challenging! ~~This can also happen if you're playing the OG and the stupid inhale button doesn't work again, forcing you to take the required damage anyway with~~ ***~~NO DAMN FAULT OF YOUR OWN!~~***

Overall, I think this fight is pretty good. If nothing else, you at least get to beat the crap out of the Wiggler that forced you to the infamous Giga Carrot challenge that everybody hates. Sure, like everything else, the minigame is less painful in the remake, but nobody likes a hypocrite.

# 13. Midbus

Gee, it sure is crazy how REGULAR Midbus manages to be a better boss than the ""upgraded"" Blizzard Midbus!

Okay, roast aside, Midbus makes the perfect target practice for your new toy to play with, Shy Guy Squad! It's all the more meaningful if you're playing the OG, and I say this because Goomba Storm SUCKS in that game! Like the Fire Flower, they both get fixed in the remake.

Apart from that, the Fawful Theater stage setting makes it all the better because you get rewarded with coins for being good at attacks, while Midbus gets rewarded with coins AND food if you have skill issues with dodging. It's also got some great customization! If you're a sore loser, you can steal Midbus's food and reward yourself for sucking at the game! If you're a REAL man, just let Midbus eat the food. It's more impressive if you manage to beat your enemy at their strongest.

Know what's sweeter than stolen donuts and cake? REVENGE! You finally get to counterattack the jump attack you got completely PWNED by before! Truly, Midbus makes an excellent MID-BOSS!

# 12. Bowser's Castle

What?! Fawful Express isn't the worst Giant Battle?!

Yeah, if you ask me, there's no such thing as a bad Giant Battle in Bowser's Inside Story. But I'm about to make a hot take that you might not be expecting... you see... in a rare coincidence... I actually think the OG has better giant battles than the 3Ds Remake. When the remake removed the mic-functionality, I was PISSED! What were they THINKING?! This is COMPLETELY immersion breaking! Why did they remove one of the best parts of the OG?! The 3D models haven't aged very well, and there's also a lot more filler.

However, this fight is really cool. It's basically Tutorial Battles done RIGHT! They tend to show rather than tell. It's the least interesting Giant Battle because it's the simplest, but it's still a good battle. You get to fight YOUR OWN CASTLE!

# 11. Tower of Yikk

This fight puts me in a good mood, because The Tower of Yikk as a location is one of the most annoying parts in the GAME! The pollen minigame is stupid annoying and it makes the Giga Carrot minigame look like a cakewalk. The Energy Hold Dungeon is also tedious due to its awkward platforming, ugly area, boring enemies, annoying invisibility segments, and CONSTANT WAITING AND SWITCHING! Can't even take a break from this dungeon, because Bowser is trapped AGAIN!

As for the battle itself, it's actually pretty great! You CANNOT damage the body until you punch it into the lake. In fact, taking damage does MORE than just hurt you... it also pushes YOU into the lake! That's why you have to be absolutely perfect in this battle!

# 10. Wisdurm

The Energy Hold was ANNOYING! Your reward for putting up with this? AN ENTERTAINING BOSS BATTLE!

You start off by fighting Durmite again! You think the fight will be easy because of how tiny and pathetic the Durmite is, but SUPRISE! It becomes a WIZARD! And it's actually DIFFICULT! But in a good, natural way that doesn't feel cheap or artificial. You have to time your attacks perfectly with the crystal heart, jump over laser stars while you get tricked and switched around, you get shrunk and have to hammer the giant, and there's NO BS HEALING! Well... even if there WAS healing involved, I wouldn't complain since you have more ways to deal with it now... and... get this... YOU CAN ACTUALLY GRIND!

There's so much strategy involved, and after the fight, Bowser gets a new slam attack! This is a MAJOR improvement over the Durmite because if you want to make a good rematch against a previous boss battle, the aim of the game is to make the rematch more difficult and less annoying. ***Take notes, Blizzard Midbus!***

# 9. Bowser

It's not a suprise to see the titular character himself in the Top 10, but I see so many people say that this is one of the best fights in the series, and number 9 doesn't do the great Koopa King enough justice. I just think the other fights are better.

Although, there's a reason why Bowser is number 9. He surprises you in the middle of the game just when you think he's dead! AND he uses your own special attacks against you! Talk about META!

Playing this game in a grindless run is HILAROUS, by the way.

>Mario: Bowser, why are you Level 14?! We are doing a grindless run!  
Bowser: Hey, don't lump me in with you! What kind of idiot handicaps themselves for FUN?!  
Mario: Oh, come on, man. You fought the Sea Pipe Statue using ONLY counterattacks, AND you took required damage from that Wiggler fight!  
Luigi: \*whispers\* Mario, PLEASE, shut up!  
Bowser: Well, look! I'm sick and tired of these stupid handicaps! Do you REALLY think that I'm just gonna fight the Super Stupid Bros GRINDLESS?! Pfft, I'm the bad guy, idiot! And bad guys CHEAT! ***Showtime!***

And cheat he does, because if you thought this fight was good in the OG? Just you wait until you play the remake, because once Bowser has FURY, he eats a drumstick and gets ALL of his HP back, so you essentially have to battle the Bowser AGAIN! ***The drumstick didn't even have cheese on it! What a cheater! XD***

Something I think was a missed opportunity was that he could've used the Broggy Bonker against us. ESPECIALLY in Dream Team. Wouldn't it be funny if Broque Monsieur sided with the Bros because Bowser stole his dog? Screw the PEACH kidnapping! This is the plotline we REALLY want!

>Mario: A thank you a so much for the free vacation! I hope we get to go on a dangerous quest!  
Luigi: Mario, something's not right. Remember that guy from the forest? He HATES us-  
Broque: Monsieurs! Turtle Bits stole my precious Broggy, and I need your help to get it back!  
Luigi: There it is...

# #8. The Fawful Express

What?! The Fawful Express is THIS HIGH?! Am I high?!

For some reason, the Fawful Express is the most infamous fight in the entire game. People tend to call this fight ""The only BAD boss in this PEAK game"" when bosses like Durmite, Kretin, and Blizzard Midbus exist. The only reason why people hate this fight is because you have to use the flames. The 3Ds Remake takes a rare L against the OG because without the microphone, the punch and flame attacks feel the same... which is... pretty infuriating... I have no idea why people praise this to no end.

In the OG especially, I think being limited to flames works in the fight's favor. You spammed punches in the last fight, anyway. It also has a banger of a concept! Not only are the attacks creative on their own, but you also have to win before the Fawful Express makes it to the train station! ~~Come to think of it, why is Bowser fighting? The train isn't worth his time. Just head over to Peach's Castle and crush Fawful yourself.~~ Can't complain, though. The fight is AWESOME! You also get to fight the train inside a mountain. FAWFUL MOUNTAIN! Don't have to use the flames all the time, but it's more fun. You get to stall for time, too! There's so much strategy involved!

# #7. Super Peach's Castle of Fury

To nobody's suprise, this is the best giant battle? What else do I need to say about it? The stakes are higher, there's black holes, and the castle turns INVISIBLE!! Not only is it hard, but any mistake can get you punished with a BLACK HOLE!

The only part about this battle that I don't like is the unavoidable attack, but it doesn't ruin the fight or anything. As long as you're good at the fight, you should be fine.

# #6. Junker

I hear a lot of people say that this fight is too easy. Apparently, they end this fight in three turns, so they have to imagine how an otherwise S-Tier fight would play out. To that, I say...

Just fight less enemies. Seriously, that's all you have to do. You can spam Falling Star and the fight will STILL be difficult if you fight less enemies.

The attacks are super creative. You are literally dodging TRASH! The Junker Cans make great goons because they come with a Self-Destruct attack after you beat them. They have a mustachioed chicken in the trash that you have to hit with a hammer.

If you think this fight is good, the 3Ds Remake makes this fight even better! The Junker Cans have poison mushrooms in their arsenal replacing the Cheep Cheeps, the Junker will actually try to HIT you with an empty can, the chickens are color coded, AND you actually get to DODGE the attack where Luigi gets vacuumed and thrown into a can! ~~As opposed to the OG where you lose Luigi wether you want to or not.~~ Additional customization is always a plus. Who wouldn't want to play battles the way you want to?

# #5. Bowser Memories

Fighting Bowser in BIS is great, because it's a battle of yourself against YOURSELF! But what's better than figuratively fighting yourself? LITERALLY DOING IT!

I really like the strategy they're going for. Luigi is the annoying healer, but he's also a scardey cat. Just attack him so Luigi can run away you can abuse Mario all you like! After that, Luigi will be fighting alone and completely defenseless!

This battle is difficult and also creative. They don't necessarily use your own attacks against you, but they tend to use your past adventures as attacks. Stars, Mushrooms, Hammers, Ghosts! Now you know how Bowser feels whenever he has to put up with your shit! Can't he just kidnap a princess in peace?!

Suprisingly enough, the boss battle is better in the OG. The remake takes a rare L in this instance, because the TURTLE is GONE! Mario just... shrinks now! This is completely anticlimactic! Gameplay wise, the battle is completely identical so why not play the remake? But where dafuq is that turtle?!

# #4. Dark Bowser

WHAT?! Dark Bowser ISN'T number one?! Well, it's this high on the list so it obviously isn't a bad battle.

Right off the bat, yes it is cool to fight Bowser AS Bowser, but it's also a little bit on the easy side. Too easy for a final battle if you ask me. I like the minion attack, punching the belly is pretty cool, but if it were just for Dark Bowser alone, this fight would be much, MUCH lower on the list.  
*In fact, kid-me would put this fight DEAD LAST on the list because when I played the OG version, it took me seven years to beat this battle. I couldn't beat the Vaccum segment, and I thought I was trapped on the top of Peach's Castle until I found the Chalkroad. Thankfully with the X & Y trick, the fight in the OG isn't so bad anymore, but it's still annoying that* ***THE GAME NEVER TELLS YOU!***

Past trauma out of the way, what REALLY carries this fight is The Dark Star Core. You have to put all your Bros. Attacks to the test! First, you SPIN PIPE the eyes, then you SNACK BASKET the legs, and you finally go ham on the DARK STAR CORE

The attacks are also adrenaline inducing! You have to get chased by Fawful, jump over black balls of varying sizes, hammer back a pointy attack, and even Starlow-Flame-Dodge for the last time! You must defeat The Dark Star Core before it's too late! Or else Fawful will heal himself, escape, and go back to Dark Bowser!

Like Blizzard Midbus, I think people glaze Dark Bowser too much. It's pretty overrated, but not CRIMINALLY overrated. It's not a bad fight. A fight can be overrated and still be good. In fact, a WHOLE GAME can be overrated, and still be good!

# #3. Dark Fawful

When it comes to bosses, Bowser tends to get the short end of the stick. Mario and Luigi get all the fun bosses, and even A BATTLE RING, while Bowser is stuck with the duds by comparison.

That changes when Dark Fawful enters the chat. He's annoying, in the BEST WAYS POSSIBLE! Any normal attack you do like punch and flame, Fawful just dodges. Pfft, what a troll, XD! It's also difficult too, because he heals a lot, AND you have to use your Goombas in a COUNTERATTACK!

Of course, the 3DS Remake makes this fight EVEN BETTER than it already is! Because instead of being forced to use the broken inhale button (which was fixed in the remake anyway), you actually have a choice to either get the Bros to help, or fight the Vaccum Helmet YOURSELF! But the improvements don't stop there, because Fawful gets a NEW ATTACK! He flies around like a maniac and you gotta be QUICK with your reflexes! Some might miss the old attack that was replaced due to budget cuts and time constraints (the one where Fawful swings around), I like the new attack better. It's harder, less predictable, more fun, AND it's more fitting for Fawful's character! Oh, and Dark Fawful gets his own theme now! I smiled when I heared that this theme was a slowed-down remix of Fawful & Cackletta.

# #2. Bowser X

This is the true endgame of Bowser's Inside Story. The true final boss! Unfortunately, it is impossible to even ATTEMPT to challenge this behemoth if you're on a grindless run, but does that even matter once you've beaten the game?

Bowser's Inside Story may be a piss easy game, but if you're fighting Bowser X, you'll forget that you're playing Bowser's Inside Story. Right off the bat, you have to fight off every other boss!  
But Bowser X ain't just for show. Even on its own, the battle is still hard. Every attack you use against him, he just eats it up, meaning that you are forced to use weaker and weaker attacks, which is scary because you're already on a turn limit that was eaten up by the other bosses!

You already know that he comes with a Goomba Storm and a Shy Guy Squad, but you also have to deal with attacks where he turns into a giant and chases you, AND he also turns into a giant, flaming spikeball! All of his attacks have the potential to KO you in one hit, and if you get KOed, you have to start the boss rush all over again, AND YOU LOSE MONEY!

If you think THIS is hard, just wait until you play the REMAKE! Bowser has Fury, AND he eats a drumstick that restores all of his health! Need I remind you, Fury boosts ALL enemy stats, so you essentially have to fight Bowser X AND an even harder version of Bowser X! If you can beat Bowser X, you can beat ANYTHING!

# #1. Dark Star

Uh oh! Peak boss alert! PEAK BOSS ALERT!

🌟Okay, guys. You know where the Dark Star is actually ranked. It's not actually number 1 because the fight is too easy, even on a grindless run. This is my only criticism, so instead, you'll just hear stuff that I actually like about the boss.✨

This is a very well designed boss battle. You can't even deal damage to it without fighting its minions. The Dark Satelmites! The attacks have so much variety within them. There's attacks that poison you and you have to jump over the red and green orbs, there's the parts where The Dark Star turns invisible and you have to hammer it, there's a Starlow Flame Dodge, and it EVEN ATTACKS YOUR SHADOW! Once you think you're done, it comes with a self-destruct attack where you have to run away from it or else you lose all your progress in this ***IMPOSSIBL***🌟ly easy peasi✨E\*\*\* BATTLE!\*\*\*

Of course, the battle is even better in the 3Ds Remake. ***IT GETS ITS OWN BOSS MUSIC!*** What else do I need to say?

# 1. Essential aspects to have longer duration.

• Develop your pelvic floor muscles with reverse kegels.

• Desensitization of the glans (don't worry, you will be able to feel the same pleasure).

• The fap method to develop the plateau stage.

• Calm the mind and the autonomic nervous system.

• Get rid of PMO to recover serotonin levels and dopamine receptors.

• Learn to have non-ejaculatory orgasms.

• Have a better quality of erection with the Angion method.

# Develop your pelvic floor muscles with reverse kegels.

These exercises will allow a longer duration and a little more control over the orgasm.

You have muscles in the area near the base of the member, called the pelvic floor muscles. They are involved in holding urine, gases and ejaculation. They are too tense in men who have short duration.

Relax your pelvic floor completely. Everyday. There is an excercise called kegel contractions. A Kegel contraction further tightens the pelvic floor muscles. To understand what a kegel does, imagine that you are squeezing to hold in urine, or gas. It's important for you to know it, because you have to learn when you are contracting the pelvic floor muscles, and how to do the oposite. Also, you need to know how does a kegel contraction feels so you can realize when you're having them.

This method requires a daily commitment. The pelvic floor muscles are those that control the release of gas, urine and ejaculation. When they are very tense, signals are sent to the autonomic nervous system to ejaculate. Each contraction also sends signals to the nervous system and reach the brain. All these signals accumulate, and when they reach above a threshold, orgasm occurs.

The pelvic floor muscles tense by automated reflex, and by staying tense, orgasm occurs much more easily. You need to learn to relax them so as not to advance the orgasm period. To become familiar and aware of these muscles, squeeze for 5 seconds as if to hold in your pee, and relax for 15 seconds as if to pee and poop.

It's pretty hard to push your hips without doing a Kegel. And each contraction is one step closer to orgasm. The quickest way to induce an orgasm is to do pelvic floor contractions since it mimics the body's natural way of bringing itself to orgasm.

**Pelvic floor muscles to last longer.**

To simplify, pelvic floor tension is interpreted as your ""arousal scale"" for your nervous system. When it reaches the threshold, the point of no return is activated. The greater the muscle tension, the more signals the nervous system sends for orgasm.

If muscle spasms in the pelvic area are inhibited, such as the bulbus spongiosum and ischiocavernosus (which are part of the pubococcygeus muscle), it takes longer to trigger the orgasm phase. Performing Keggel exercises, but aimed at this, can inhibit muscle spasms in the pelvic area. You don't have to train them as for hypertrophy, but to train the mind-muscle connection and be more aware of when they are contracting and how to relax them.

Muscle elasticity increases directly after a contraction, this is used in manual therapy to relieve muscle spasms and muscle hyperactivation throughout the body. That's why it's so beneficial to do 5-second Kegel contractions and then a 10-second reverse Kegel.

When you feel like you've gained enough control, you can even do it during sex to tone down your arousal by doing a reverse Kegel right after a Kegel.

The Reverse Kegel It is done as if you are trying to pee. Don't just push back as if you wanted to do number 2, also push forward as if you wanted to do number 1. Be very cautious of this when you're having sex with a partner. Practice a lot alone before, to avoid accidents.

Some of the pelvic floor muscles are structurally very close to the transversus abdominis muscle, so squeezing your abs during sex can increase tension and arousal.

# Desensitization of the glans.

There is an ancient tantric/taoist practice that focuses on the glans. The practice consists of being sitted, legs appart, and hitting your thighs with the glans repeatedly. The objective is to gradually desensitize the nerves in that area to be able to last longer without reaching orgasm.

Premature orgasm is often very unpleasant. The reason is that it took very little time for brain, muscles and the whole body to produce a more complete physical reaction.

This will not cause you to lose pleasure, but on the contrary. It makes the build up to orgasm take longer, making the orgasm being much more pleasurable. But it will also give you much more control and duration as you progress.

Tapping on the glans and crown will gradually desensitize the nerves over the weeks. Caution. No need to get hurt. If something causes pain or injury, it is too intense.

# The fap method to develop the plateau.

**A brief explanation:**

The human sexual response is all the physical and hormonal changes that human beings experience when faced with sexual stimulation. It was studied by sexologist.

The male sexual response consists of the following 4 phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

Excitement phase:

It's all that produces the desire to have a sexual relationship. From looks, words, touch, smiles, etc.

Plateau phase:

Is a stage in sex of sustained excitement, enjoyment of the present moment and the physical sensations, and experiencing vividly the present moment.

Pre-ejaculatory stage: it is just before reaching the point of no return, but you are so sensitive that any extra stimulus produces ejaculation. Some men remain on this phase in a practice called edging, believing it's going to make them be able to hold more. But we are going to see now that this practice is not good.

Point of no return: this is when ejaculation is imminent, regardless of whether you continue with activity or not.

Orgasm phase:

The orgasm arises after the excitement and plateau phases. Heart rate and breathing reach their maximum frequency and intensity. There is great muscle tension and involuntary contractions of the penis, vaginal muscles and anal sphincter. Ejaculation usually occurs in men.

Resolution phase:

It is the gradual restoration of physical and mental normality, after having reached orgasm. The man experiences a refractory period, during which he is unable to become aroused again, or to do so with the same intensity. Women, on the other hand, do not have a refractory period and are capable of achieving multiple and frequent orgasms.

**The fap method to develop the plateau.**

This fap method allows you to develop the plateau phase, while also helping to desensitize the glans. The objective is masturbation without reaching phases close to ejaculation. To be effective, it's done without edging (bordering on orgasm), without reaching the point of no return (PONR) and without reaching orgasm or very close stages to orgasm.

You need to do sessions from 5 to 60 minutes, arriving as few times as possible close to orgasm. The key of this method is to masturbate and stay as far away from orgasm as possible, to separate the sensations of stimulating the penis and being aroused, with the activation of orgasm. In this way the nervous system learns to maintain, enjoy and prolong the plateau phase without having the automatic mechanic activation to orgasm. This method prolongs the plateau stage and makes reaching orgasm take longer.

By never bringing yourself close to orgasm, the body learns to feel the plateau and prolong it. It makes you start enjoying the sexual process itself, and remove the excessive focus on orgasm. This is what makes the difference with edging method, in which you're forcing yourself to resist the orgasm impulses and constantly putting more focus on orgasm. Edging is also at some point, kind of a torture even when technically it should be pleasurable.

With this fap method, the glans is desensitized at the same time you develop the plateau phase. It gives you more confidence in your sexuality. Impulse control develops in your brain. The rewire of neuronal paths and the creation of neural networks related to sex and sexual stimuli. You're beating the very bases of premature orgasm.

>""The temptation to give up is going to be greatest just when you are about to succeed.""

""We gain strength from the temptation we resist.""

""If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up.""

**Method guide.**

Masturbate directly on the glans, with the foreskin off. Using enough lubricant and the palm of the hand surrounding your glans, emulating a vulva. Fap untill you need to stop, it doesn't matter if that moment is a second after you start. The practice is about masturbating until before you feel the orgasm is coming close (that is to say, before edging). Stop whenever you need to, calm your excitement level, and start again. Mantain yourself aroused but not about to orgasm.

This method is made withouth porn since we are going to see later, porn sensitizes the brain to orgasm quick. But some porn users may not even be able to feel aroused or have libido or an erection without porn stimuli. We will look at this problem below. Many of them get better after some weeks of getting rid of it, and the others must nourish them very well and do physical activity to recover hormonal levels and normal levels of dopamine receptors in the brain in order to feel excitement again.

You have to completely replace the traditional fap method, and use this method, which is more stimulating and equals or surpasses a vulva in terms of nerve stimulation. So your central nervous system readjusts to interpret the signals sent by the nerves of your penis in a less sensitive and receptive way. Making the vulva unable to overstimulate you and produce an orgasm in a few seconds.

It's ideal to have a session every day, and for each session to last from 5 minutes to up to 60 minutes. Since it is very stimulating, you should not feel guilty if you sometimes reach the point of no return or orgasm, but understand that this method is effective if you avoid those phases.

The premature ejaculator has the plateau phase so burned out and diminished that at first he cannot even recognize anything between sexual desire and sensations that leads to the orgasm.

Be kind to yourself. You are learning now and improving. Don't beat yourself up if you orgasm without realizing it in time. Take it easy. As we will see later, part of this is due to neural effects produced by pornography use.

During the session you have to pay attention to the sensations that arise, and thus you develop awareness of your plateau phase. You will see your arousal. It's not the mega-arousal that you have during an orgasm. It is a more sustained and smoother excitement.

You will become more aware of when you are about to enter the pre-ejaculatory stage (pre-edging zone), and you will learn to stop sooner. This way you develop awareness and little by little you begin to see masturbation and sex not as a means to achieve orgasm, but as something enjoyable in itself.

With PMO we train our brain chemicals to make the body finish quickly. And this became a programmed reflex in our body. With this method you need to be strong, because if you are used to finishing quickly, not doing so can be immensely difficult at first. Furthermore, pornography is a hyperstimulus that increases dopamine, and what dopamine does is bring forward the orgasm. Therefore, this method is done without pornography, and only by stimulating yourself with masturbation and imagining that you are penetrating a vulva.

**Start with light grip:**

During the sessions, it is very important to breathe deeply and relax your pelvic muscles. For the first 5 minutes, and only for the first 5 minutes, start very slowly and gently to acclimatize the nerves and brain so that they can then receive more stimulation without activating the mechanics of an orgasm. Gentle fapping but as much as possible, continuous if possible without reaching the pre-ejaculatory phase.

**Continue the session with a standard grip:**

Then continue with a standard grip. The standard grip needs to be a little firmer and more stimulating than a vulva. Once in the standard grip, breaks will obviously be necessary. Take all the breaks you need. The objective is not to reach the pre-ejaculatory phase and to learn and assimilate and recognize all the sensations that exist in the plateau phase.

**Repetition and consistency is substitution:**

Repetition is important. It is about replacing the involuntary automated reflex of rapid orgasm with that of relaxing the pubococcygeus muscle. Whenever you involuntarily come close to ejaculation, stop all stimulation, breathe from the base of the lungs and relax the pubococcygeus muscle. This way the excitement is reduced and you learn to tame that ejaculating beast.

**Avoid orgasm and pre-ejaculatory phases:**

If orgasm occurs, adaptation does not occur and you reach orgasm or reach a very close phase. For the method to work, you have to avoid orgasm or get very close to ejaculation.

**Replacing fear when orgasm is very easy with full confidence in your abilities:**

At first you may feel like an orgasm is imminent just from touching yourself a little, or just thinking about it. This is called performance anxiety and is responsible for making you overexcited during sex and capable of producing an instant orgasm. With the days of practice that will reduce. This is psychological by suggestion. It's not about your nerves if you can hold your penis to pee without having an orgasm, but rather a neurochemical factor. It's just about confidence on yourself that you're going to develop.

You should completely replace conventional masturbation with this masturbation method. And from now on, every time you want to have an orgasm you have to last at least 20 minutes with this method before allowing yourself to reach a phase close to ejaculation. After 20 minutes of bulding up your orgasm in plateau phase, avoid edging, and just have the orgasm.

This is how you reeducate your brain. It is key to train the brain and understand that stimulation does not necessarily have to be for ejaculation. This is achieved by ensuring that in most masturbation sessions you do not finish, and in the sessions in which you do, you do so by masturbating for a long time before reaching a phase close to ejaculation. At a certain point, the idea of ​​orgasm stops appearing in your mind when you masturbate, and you start being more present with the present moment, enjoying the excitement. This is what we seek and this is your cure. You focus more on the sensations of the plateau than on ejaculating.

At first the plateau phase may seem absurd, boring or meaningless for you. Maybe you feel that there is no point in masturbating if it is not to have an orgasm. As you progress it will begin to make sense to your body and brain, as a pleasurable and entertaining activity in itself.

Sex is not only orgasm. Through quality sex you will strengthen an emotional bond with your partner, you satisfy your partner, you maintain physical activity, you improve the health of your brain in ways that we are not aware of at the moment, you give yourself more confidence.

**Have strong stimuli from time to time to desensitize the nerves:**

After having stimulation with standard grip without orgasming, gradually start trying fast speeds and tight grip. I recommend going fast and strong for 1 to 5 seconds at first, depending on your current level, and increasing it little by little, but staying away from the pre-ejaculatory phase/edging zone. If that happens, calm down and wait 1 or 2 minutes.

It's usually helpful to go fast and tight for 5 seconds and completely stop any stimulus for 10 seconds or more, or continue with a standard grip.

One of the most stimulating sexual position for a man is sitting with her riding. And it's one of the favorite of most women. If you build nerve tolerance to tight grip and fast speed, you will be able to stay there longer and longer. Without fear.

**Improvement case with this fap method:**

>Basically, I quit porn and started masturbating without ejaculation every day, I started exploring myself and my sensations. I only allowed myself 1 ejaculation a week. My idea was that if I could last 10 minutes masturbating, then I could last 10 minutes in bed, I couldn't last a minute masturbating. So, by starting to masturbate every day (standing up), I got results.

That's the case of a reddit user here in this sub. Sources:

# Calm the mind and the nervous system.

There is something called the Autonomic Nervous System, it operates internal organs, smooth muscle and glands. This System is divided in two parts called Sympathetic, and Parasympathetic. Both must function to maintain the various different functions of the organs and processes.

This Sympathetic system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response. It's about action, adrenaline, dopamine, movement, stress, tension, orgasm.

The Parasympathetic system is the primary mechanism in control of rest, digestion, restoration, anabolism and tissue construction.

The muscle spasm response of orgasm is activated by the Sympathetic system, which is also activated by different stimuli such as excesive excitement, anxiety, fear, porn, pelvic floor muscle tension, accelerated breathing, etc.

Reducing or quitting the things that activate the sympathetic nervous system makes sex last longer. Why? Because the sympathetic nervous system is what sends the signals to produce the orgasm.

**Breathing deep to induce the parasympathetic nervous system:**

Breathe a little deeper and a little slower than you would like. Your heart races as your breathing changes. Much of this is autonomic, but the easiest autonomic function to modify is breathing. Breathe as if you were completely mentally relaxed. As if you had been in the same activity, but with total calm. Breathe as if you are about to fall asleep.

**Psychological factor: over-arousal.**

The emotional psychological factor of premature orgasm is about self-confidence. Don't put women on a pedestal or deify woman and sex. Understand that a vulva is not so different to your hand. The stimuli very similar in intensity. The difference is in your mind, by unconciously believing things like that you may not be enough for her, that you will not do it well, that you will not satisfy her, that she will think that you are not worth it as a couple, that you don't deserve to have a good moment, that you have no value to feel pleasure or happiness.

All that absolutely activates your sympathetic response.

Be totally present and fully experiencing what is happening at all times of the sexual experience. You have value. You're not anything lesser than any potential partner. Calm down. Just relax. It's not the end of the world. You just have a quick orgasmic response by now, due to neurochemical disbalances, glans nerve sensitiveness and wrong emotional beliefs. You will gradually disolve all that and develop more duration.

Relax. It's allright :)

**Psychological approach with a sexologist psychologist:**

One user on Reddit reported going to a sex psychologist for 2 or 3 months and talk about sex and his repressed emotions. He discovered that everything related to sex was prohibited in his childhood in his family. So he became very sneaky about hiding it and very embarrassed about everything related to sex.

**Inner calm through present experience:**

In the Taoist mentality of tantra, the key is to have no goal. It seems difficult, but it's about being completely present in the moment. A goal like ""not finishing"" is a distraction. Experience sex totally, without any expectation or goal of having or not having an orgasm.

**More ways to enhance the parasympathetic nervous system and to reduce the excessive sympathetic responses.**

There are stimuli to increase the parasympathetic system. One of them is breathing, which is interesting because it is related to the vagus nerve, the phrenic nerve and the heart. Deep inhalation for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds to stimulate the switch from sympathetic to parasympathetic, slow exhalation for 8 seconds to intensify parasympathetic stimulation. You can do this before or during sex.

During sex, you'll want to at least breathe deeply and from your diaphragm and focus on exhaling slowly. It doesn't necessarily have to be 8 seconds, but the exhalation should be longer than the inhalation to stimulate parasympathetic regulation. Breathing deeply and slowly activates the parasympathetic system. Simply breathing deeply and slowly through your abdomen will signal to your body that there is no danger and your parasympathetic activity will increase.

# Get rid of PMO to recover serotonin levels.

>""Hell and destruction are never satisfied, just as the eyes of man are never satisfied"" -Proverbs 27:20

Pornography produces excessive sensitization in the neural pathways of orgasm, accustoming the brain to having an orgasm more quickly. But at the same time, it produces desensitization to the different sexual stimulus such as visual, making it require much more to produce and maintain an erection. This translates into a weaker erection but a faster orgasm at the same time. The worst of both worlds.

Many people mistakenly consume pornography because they believe it will desensitize them to orgasm. However, what will desensitize is the erection, and the orgasm will come much sooner.

This point may be te most shocking. But by every time watching porn, you are reducing the plateau phase and screwing your brain chemistry balance. There is zero tolerance to porn when it comes to develop longer duration in man with premature orgasm.

# Learn to have non-ejaculatory orgasms.

You may notice that if you ejaculate and then have another round, the second ejaculation may take longer. This is due to the refractory phase, which is when it is difficult to ejaculate again.

When you have a non-ejaculatory orgasm, you can partially keep an erection and continue having sex. I'm not very advanced in this tehnique but I share what I know. Keep in mind that is better to improve in all the other practices and not have to come to this:

Stop all the touch stimulus and contract the muscles in the pre-ejaculatory stage, just when you reach the point of no return.

When the man reaches the pre-ejaculatory stage, he can perform the pelvic floor contraction, withdraw the penis and suspend any type of touch on the member for a while.

Liquid may not come out, and orgasm feelings may not occur, but the orgasm process occurs, arousal is reduced and the member falls a bit, but you keep the erection, and due to the post orgasm process, you can have sex without the refractory phase.

# Improve your erection quality with the Angion method.

If you need to do a Kegel to get an erection, you're already halfway to an orgasm. Kegel-assisted erections usually come with a somewhat pleasurable sensation in the glans. Unfortunately, this sensation is like a tickle in the nose that causes a sneeze.

Ideally you need the member to become erect without even having to stimulate it with your hands. The Angion method is the best to improve erection quality. There is a sub on Reddit for you to check the excercise.

# 2. Things that work to improve duration.

**Start the penetration or stimulation slowly:**

By the way, most women prefer a gentle start. If you start very abruptly, you will not give your brain and nerves time to gradually adapt, and therefore any stimulus will be more intense.

The first 5 minutes are the most important. Think of the first 5 minutes as a vulva massage, where you use your penis to massage the vulva. Eventually you will notice that the sensations are not so overwhelming and you can start having sex at a higher intensity.

These first 2 to 5 minutes of vulva massage also stimulate her in a way that contribute to buid up the orgasm for her, but not for you.

**Local anesthetic:**

It is also called a topical anesthetic. They usually contain lidocaine; which is very effective. Benzocaine is also used but is less effective and has a shorter duration. There are creams with 20% lidocaine. It is used as a cream or spray. Lidocaine gets into the skin and numbs the nerves. The effect begins only 5 minutes after applying it and lasts up to 90 minutes.

It is placed inside the condom and placed on the glans, preventing it from touching the outside of the condom. The cream is massaged through the condom onto the glans and crown and left to act 15 minutes before sex. The cream form can deteriorate the latex and break it. The best is in spray.

It is important to wash your hands well and that the anesthetic does not touch the condom on the outside so as not to transfer the effect to the clitoris and vulva.

This anesthetic works the same as desensitizing the glans using the technique already mentioned above. But it can be used for a specific case. Once you have advanced in desensitization, it will not be necessary.

The negative thing about anesthetic is that it is inopportune, it may take effect too late for sexual intercourse, and the worst of all is that too much can numb the member and eliminate the erection. It is also uncomfortable to hold your anesthetic everywhere, etc.

# Things that don't work to improve duration.

**Seeing an urologist:**

Seeing an urologist is in some way positive, because it helps you verify that you don't have physical disorders that cause short duration. But many of them don't even know the negative effects of porn, or say that it cannot be cured. Which can be counterproductive to your psyche and confidence.

What's worse, some may give you pharmacological treatment, or tell you that your nerves are simply very sensitive and that's how it works. Some of them sustain that if a man last more than 30 seconds or 60 seconds it's not premature ejaculation and you should not worry much. Tell that to a woman.

**Drugs:**

They only make you last a little longer, but they don't cure you and they are a nuisance. Plus they have side effects. Sertraline, or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often recommended since low levels of serotonin are what cause premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation is caused by an alteration and deficiency of these neurotransmitters.

But it is full of cases of users who report that although at first it worked for them to last a little longer, the development of tolerance made the duration worse. And by leaving it they make its duration even worse.

# 4. Neurochemistry of orgasm.

**Serotonin:**

Serotonin increases the latency time of ejaculation (this is the main reason why SSRIs, as well as antidepressants, are prescribed for premature ejaculators), and inhibits the secretion of dopamine, which is one of the main sympathetic neurotransmitters.

**Dopamine:**

It seems that a high level of dopamine greatly modifies the autonomic system to favor the sympathetic system and ejaculation. In a premature ejaculator, the sympathetic system is overactive and the parasympathetic is absent. In this case you have to reduce the sympathetic and activate the parasympathetic. However, without enough dopamine there is no erection. Therefore, reducing dopamine is not recommended if you suffer from erectile dysfunction. Sleeping well, avoiding sweets and drugs is necessary for healthy dopamine levels.

Avoid sugar, smoke, weed smoke, fast food and drugs, since they all screw dopamine levels.

# 5. Supplements that help.

It's a mineral. A little rock of metal. But it's necessary for almost 300 different functions in the body. It's necessary for producing ATP in all the cells, the basic energy of the whole body. It also calms the body. Activate the parasympathetic nervous sysyem. It will make you rest better, etc.

Forms:

Preferably use magnesium citrate, magnesium gluconate, magnesium glycinate since they are more bioabsorbable. There is a cheaper alternative: magnesium chloride. But it may make you go to the bathroom. Avoid magnesium oxide, since body can't absorb it. It's used as a diuretic.

From 200 to 500 mg per day.

**Ginseng.**

It's a root used in oriental medicine. All variants work. They increase libido. Very important for people who recently got rid of porn. But be cautious since libido can lead to porn habits again.

**Zinc.**

It is another small particle of metal. Body interprets it as a hormone. And it's necessary for creating testosterone. Low testosterone levels are linked to premature orgasm.

From 7 to 40 mg per day. Preferably around 15-20.

**Vitamin D3 and K2.**

Both work together to create testosterone.

D3: from 2000 to 10.000 IU per day. K2 around 100 mcg.

**Ginger.**

Another root and it's good for energy levels, some libido and testosterone.

# The rest is up to you.

Start small. Just one little thing at a time. Then another. Don't get lost on overwhelming thoughts of all the things you have to do.

Refuse to be a victim of resentment, fear or frustration. Refuse to be slave of your instincts and feelings. Instead, Let go of all the bad things and keep moving forward. You can feel angry or bad, but do something positive for you out of any emotion you have. Use your anger as the fuel to give you energy to start improving your life and the things around you.

Allow yourself the opportunity to shine.

"Shinjuku, Tokyo",photographs,1dxcehm,2024-07-07 05:14:23,53,0.97,3,https://i.redd.it/umilbaiyc2bd1.jpeg,oqswildride,Feedback Welcome,
Gifts for the DR2 Cast (Nagito Headcanon),danganronpa,1dovfl8,2024-06-26 06:36:33,4,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/1dovfl8/gifts_for_the_dr2_cast_nagito_headcanon/,Reydon0427,Discussion,"I had this headcanon about Nagito (I suppose for AUs and settings without the killing game) where he gives gifts to his uLtiMaTe sYmBoLs oF HoPe he adores (of course Hajime included) and they are really thoughtful gifts relating to their talents and/or interests BUT they end up being really awkward/weird gifts to give someone but Nagito does not realise that. So the guys are all really awkward about it when they receive the gifts but grow to love them a lot.   
  
So my example for this was that he would gift Gundham what are basically cat headphones but he makes the ears detachable and gives him sets of ears of different kinds of animals (and they light up too). Gundham obviously ""pfft""s at it saying that ""for a supreme demon overlord, this is too... \*tone of derision and disgust\* cute"" but he actually loves it.

After this, I decided to ask ChatGPT for ideas for what the other characters' gifts could be and with those suggestions and my own combined, here is a list of thoughtful but awkward gifts the characters would receive from Nagito: 

**Hajime:** A customized scrapbook filled with detailed notes, clippings, and drawings about all the potential talents Hajime might have, with sections left blank for Hajime to fill in as he discovers more about himself. (This made me burst into laughter when it was suggested, I can't help but lose it at how done Hajime would be on receiving this)

**Chiaki:** A retro handheld gaming console that Nagito has painstakingly modified to have an unsettling ""hope and despair"" theme, including custom game cartridges. Bonus points if in an AU with nothing to do with the killing school game, the game he puts on it is the Danganronpa 2 game itself haha. 

**Fuyuhiko:** A meticulously crafted, miniature yakuza-themed board game where Fuyuhiko is the main character, complete with tiny, detailed figures of his family and rivals. (This was also so funny when I read it because it's so random, it's great). I can't wait to see Fuyuhiko being pissed about his figure being ridiculously short in comparison to all the others. Needless to add, he would secretly keep the figurine of him and Peko around him where he could look at it whenever he wants. Extra bonus points if this became a fun bonding activity for the Kuzuryu clan to play together. 

**Akane:** A too-cheery-and-eye-catching looking motivational food dispenser which only dispenses food once Akane has finished some small physical exercise like a certain number of jumping jacks, running laps, or punches the mini punching bag it comes attached with. This is followed by a motivational message recorded by Nagito which is something weird as he usually says like ""You can overcome any obstacle, as expected of an Ultimate like you!"" or ""You are shining with so much hope right now!"". She finds it very weird and a bit embarrassing but is very endeared by the gesture and gets really happy everytime she gets food from it after a task. Bonus if this has Pavlov'd her into liking (and drooling) whenever Nagito goes on one of his hope boner speeches again because she expects food with it now.

**Gundham:** As mentioned above, Nagito gifts him cat ear headphones but with detachable ears that can be swapped for different animals, like wolves, bats, and dragons. Each ear has a small enchantment like Gundham's earring (courtesy of Nagito's imagination) that Gundham pretends to disdain but secretly loves.

**Sonia:** I got quite a few cool ideas from ChatGPT, which included   
1) A high-tech, interactive ghost-hunting kit that includes an EMF detector, a spirit box, and a thermal camera, all packaged in a box designed to look like a spooky, old tome, accompanied by a detailed guidebook, written by Nagito, filled with ghost stories and urban legends from around the world.   
2) A collection of clothes that combine elements from various traditional outfits of different cultures, such as a kimono with Celtic knot designs or a sari with Aztec patterns. Each piece comes with a note explaining the cultural significance of the elements used. Sonia finds the combinations strange at first but appreciates the unique fashion statement and the cultural fusion concept. Alternatively (or additionally?), accessories designed after objects associated with serial killer cases from all around the world. 

**Kazuichi:** A pastel-colored, heart-shaped multitool and kit of tools like wrenches and screwdrivers. The tools are high-quality and ergonomically designed but each handle is shaped like a heart and colored in soft pastels and it looks like they are from a kid's play set. They come in a custom toolbox with a built-in speaker that plays motivational messages recorded by Nagito.

**Peko**: Either a sword cleaning set that is extremely ornate and decorative or too kawaii-looking, but that consists a lot of tools, oils, cloths, etc. that are extremely specific and very high-quality and useful. Alternatively, a tea set decorated with samurai armor patterns and symbols, including a teapot and cups, along with a bamboo whisk and matcha powder, but each piece is adorned with tiny, motivational quotes that are oddly poetic but everyone else considers nonsensical. Another fun idea was a costume set that includes a sleek, black outfit complete with a trench coat, sunglasses, and various “spy gadgets” like a pen that doubles as a flashlight and a pair of shoes with hidden compartments etc.

**Mahiru:** A crazy looking camera kit that has weird attachable filters and lenses for her camera like fisheye, kaleidoscope, thermal imaging, glitter lens, etc., very explicitly labelled as a kit for taking ""hope pictures"".

**Hiyoko:** A dollhouse that is extremely creepy both the house itself as well as the dolls. While the others think it's weird, Hiyoko loves it and is really happy. Alternatively, a DDR-like dance mat that is extremely over the top and full of bright flashing colours, that has, as expected, motivational messages from Nagito when she dances on it. 

**Ibuki:** A funky-looking voice-distorting megaphone that does all kinds of weird voice effects whenever she uses it. Ibuki loves it and uses it at all her shows, which Nagito and the others do attend and have grown to enjoy because of her energy (even if the music is still sometiems painful to them). At first though, all of them, including Nagito, don't know how to react when the voice distortion makes the songs they already found weird even weirder and they all glare at Nagito for it and he also wonders if he made a choice of despair this time. That all changes though because they can't help but smile at how much Ibuki is enjoying herself :)

**Mikan:** Overly cute and decorated medical kit, including but not limited to patterned bandages and bandaids with cute animal, heart, stars, and flower stickers, casts with hope-filled messages already written on them by yours truly, colourful antiseptic bottles labelled things like ""Healing Hope"", cartoon stickers and LED-flashing toys to reassure and distract patients, etc. While Mikan loves this, some of the others are not so pleased when as the days go by, they have to end up wearing some of these bandaids and stickers when they are hurt and treated by Mikan.

**Nekomaru:** A personalized training journal full of motivational quotes, glitter, and stickers for Nekomaru to track his schedules, exercise regiments, diets, etc. Also accompanied by motivational posters that are pretty much like the ""hang in there"" cat posters but Nekomaru loves them a lot (and very loudly) and the big guy carries that little glitter-decorated journal with him everywhere.

After Salisek and I composed ourselves we decided to go see Yalga who by the time we got back was being entertained by Dad as he told stories of me growing up.

“Your dad loved to bring the smallest kids in class into sports. He always loved seeing how they grew physically and mentally. One of those kids adopted your friend Odin.”

“What sports did Daddy play?”

“Lots of things. He liked a lot of fighting sports like wrestling, but he didn’t stay for long for some reason.”

*I never did tell him why I left. I don’t think dad would understand I got bored and wanted to learn about every fighting style from other kids who loved fighting as much as I did. I wonder what happened to all of them?*

Pulling that thought from my mind I knocked on the doorframe and let myself in. Yalga was happy to see her parents.

“Mommy, Daddy! Am I okay?” Yalga asked.

Salisek and I sat at her feet to give her the news. The entire news. I needed to keep my words simple, honest, and straightforward.

“We spoke to the doctors and they said that you should be out of here tomorrow. They’ll keep an eye on you to make sure you heal well.”

“Really, that’s it? If I feel a lot better can we ask to go home early?”

“I don’t see why not, but let's keep you here where the doctors can make sure you’re really okay.”

“Oh, okay.”

“Also… your mother and I spoke to the doctors and they said they can help fix the broken bones in your body.”

Yalga perked up, “They can! Really, when?!”

“We need to wait a few months. It’s gonna take a lot of surgery, and a lot of healing. It’s not gonna be easy. You’ll be in and out of the hospital once we start. I know it’s hard but this is the only way to help alleviate the pain.”

Yalga's happy demeanor slowly faded the more I talked. She realized that the healing of her back and the healing of her burn would be very different.

“Oh,” she said, trying to sound unaffected. “That’s okay. I know you’ll take care of me.”

Yalga’s tone of voice showed her how she really felt. She really wanted to go home, but I couldn’t let her go home yet. What should I do? I didn’t know how I’d make it…

*Wait… I got it!*

I excused myself and made a call I knew my daughter would enjoy. I know she didn’t initially want *him* to know, but I know she’ll love the company. After checking to make sure it was okay with the doctors I sent a text to Samuel asking him to bring a few things. Yalga was hungry, and while the cafeteria was open, I knew she’d like something else.

After about an hour a knock on the door was heard. I grabbed my daughter's attention by looking overly excited and curious as she dramatically turned the door handle. “I wonder who that could be?”

The sight of pizza and a bag of sweets may have caught her nose, but I knew who she was really excited to see.

“Odin!”

My daughter held out her arms as her young boyfriend leapt onto the bed and gave her a gentle hug. “Yalga, are you okay?! I’m here now.”

Yalga got emotional, she tried to contain her tears as she spoke. “Yeah, I’m okay. I’m happy you’re here. Um… can we eat the pizza now?”

We laughed at the situation and dug in, each of us having our fill, even Dr. Brown came by and was happy to take an early lunch to join in on the festivities since he was working near the holidays.

Dr. Triva  saw us, and it was clear she was getting used to Arxur given that being in the room with two didn’t affect her. She eyed our family meal, curiosity sparkled in her eyes. “Oh, that smells nice.” She took a look inside the box and held up a slice. “Do you mind if I try some?”

*We should tell her.*

**Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.Let her.**

I faked coughed to get the doctor’s attention, her excited gaze almost made my intrusive thoughts win, “Dr. Triva, that pizza is called *meat lovers*. My daughter is an *Arxur*.”

“Oh-AH!” The teddy bear doctor couldn’t *bear* the knowledge of what she was holding and threw the slice up into the air to be caught by my daughter’s maw.

I paid for the pizza and cookies since I know my daughter has an appetite, and I want her to have her fill. Once she’s released we’re planning something for her so she can have a break from everything before the surgery.

The next day she should be released from the hospital, and in a few months she’ll get her surgery and will hopefully recover in time for school. In the meantime, I need to plan a wedding, we’ll have enough time for the ceremony and moving into the new place so Yalga can recover in her own space.

*Boy, that’s a lot of invitations.*

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Saliek, future Bride-to-Be

Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: January 19th, 2136

Carlos has been really busy lately. It made sense. Elena told me that human weddings are very special and take a lot of planning and sometimes money. But we didn’t want our wedding to be too fancy because it would take too long and far too much money. We wanted to get married soon so they can be together and have our own space. The kids deserve that at least.

I was gonna miss living with my parents, but our house isn’t too far. We got to see the outside of it a few weeks ago, but the tenant was still living in it so we couldn’t go inside. Carlos says that they’ll leave soon, and he made sure the person didn’t have any issues. Which was nice because I didn’t want the person living there to not have anywhere to sleep so we could have a house. It wouldn’t sit right with me otherwise.

Carlos was trying his best, working a lot to pay for the expenses. He was working too much overtime, but insisted it’s what he needed to do. I didn’t argue with him further. Elena was gonna cook a lot to save some money and even June and Grace’s parents were gonna help too. Despite them insisting that they’d pay for the groceries for the event Carlos insisted on paying for the service, or at the very least the cost of the food. Elena gave him the chancla for suggesting that she needed to be paid to help her son. She was not having any of that.

*Honestly, I wish I could do the same thing.*

I don’t know why Carlos was being so difficult! Everyone was willing to donate their time, money, experience, anything they could and he wouldn’t let them off without compensation. Cousins I’ve never heard of, one’s he’s claimed he hasn’t seen in years, were willing to come early and help set up before the wedding, bring food, play instruments, anything to help make a cheap wedding feel like a festival. All for free, and it all bothered him.

They were a herd, a pack, a family. Does he not realize that I’d kill to have a herd that big growing up? Only two people from my home were even considered for my wedding. My Mom and Dad! I had no one, yet Carlos has everyone and he doesn’t appreciate it.

I had to stop myself. I was getting heated and I just wanted to try on some dresses. Mom was helping pick out a dress for the very special occasion and she had some help too. Apparently the Bride was supposed to have her friends walk with her, a role called Bridesmaid, so they needed special dresses too. So I needed to call all of her friends.

“Vraka, be honest with me. Does this dress make me look fat?” I asked. Carlos said I was perfect the way I am, but I’m not human. I don’t know what that means.

Vraka glanced up and down at my figure. “Umm, is fat supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing?”

*Oh yeah, I forgot about Arxur’s view on body weight.*

“Don’t worry sweetheart,” Mom said. “I think it looks lovely on you. Carlos is gonna faint at just how beautiful his mate is gonna look on your special day.”

The dress was white and decorated with pretty balls called pearls, and even had a very long cape at the end of it that flowed behind my tail. A special change was gonna be made so it could poke out so I’d be comfortable.

Looking at myself in the mirror made me feel proud of my appearance. A feeling I did not have for most of my life. But now, I was a princess in a fairytale. The other Princesses; Cindy, Grace, Samantha, June, May, and Krasai were giving their own compliments as they tried to find a dress for themselves. They would be my Bridesmaids, with Vraka being my maid of honor.

We couldn’t decide who the flower girls should be between Yalga, Helen, and Chalta. So the girls decided amongst themselves that they’d all be the flower girls. Pyon would bring the rings although it’s being debated on whether we should have Elena walk with him so he doesn't eat the rings.

*I nearly had a heart attack when I caught him chewing on a Lego.*

“Carlos is such a lucky man,” Cindy said, happily trying on a dress of her own.

“I know, and you two already have two beautiful children together,” Grace giggled. “I’m so happy for you both. I’ll bake the best cake for you both.”

Helen came out with the dress that she picked with Jurra earlier this week. She was getting it fitted. She came out like a beautiful water lily, straight out of the books. “My sister looks so pretty. Sali, is it true I’m gonna throw flowers for you to walk on in the wedding? Jurra didn’t believe me when you said that.”

I chuckled at my sisters nickname for me. I thought about how precious she was, and how odd it was that my daughter is older than her. But it didn’t matter to me. We all loved each other, and I was proud to be a mother of two beautiful children.

Yes, two beautiful children. Children to love, to hold, to house… to feed, to educate, to heal. And while he toils away all day to make sure they have everything I’m home just… being there. Yes I’m raising and taking care of them but is that really enough?

June stood next to me, and stared at me through the mirror. She admired the dress a lot, but noticed how I felt. “Sugar, are you okay? You seem distracted.”

“Yeah,” I sighed. “It’s just…” I looked at the price tag attached to the dress. “Let’s go with something… cheaper.”

*This isn’t right. I should’ve been more sensitive, more cautious.*

Mom started bleating in panic like when she’s upset and worried, “No you are not, I’ll pay for the dress. Only the best for my daughter.”

“What?! No, mom you don’t even have a job yet. You’re not using your savings to pay for this!”

I had no idea what she was thinking. Elena was finding Mom a job as a teaching assistant while she got her license. According to her they were being lenient considering all the people moving here in the midst of everything going on. But the process could still take a while, and my parents only had so much money before I dragged them here. They need their own car and house.

“I chose to move here, I chose to sell our things that we couldn’t bring, I chose to pay for this dress you want for your special day!”

“No, I can’t let you do that. If I can’t afford my dress-”

“If you can’t afford it then I, as your mother, will help you pay for it! You’ve been working so hard.”

I started getting upset, we were yelling at each other again. I don’t like when we do that. We’ve been yelling more and more lately. Weddings are supposed to be happy. Why are we arguing so much all the time now? I could see Helen in my peripheral vision looking worried, but I selfishly kept going.

“NO! Carlos can’t afford it! This isn’t my money to spend. He’s been working his tail off trying to make sure we have the best life we can have and still tries to play with Pyon and Yalga after working nearly twelve hours a day while I’m at home being a useless fiance who’s spending his money on a dress!”

“How could you say that?! Carlos worked hard for you because he loves you.”

“P-Please st-stop… yelling,” Helen squealed. “Y-You l-love each other.”

“I don’t want him to suffer for this stupid dress!” I spat at the woman who gave life to me.

“Then let me pay for it,” she pleaded.

“I can’t do that to you!”

I couldn’t breathe now. I was trying to stop crying, but my tears were already coming. I couldn’t control my anger. I don’t know why I was so upset. But I didn’t stop yelling until I heard a cry that wasn’t mine. It was Helen’s. She was curled up into a shaking ball. I walked up to comfort her but June beat me to it.

“It’s alright Sal, I got her. Go patch things up with mama, kay?”

My only friends left me alone with my mother. We didn’t say a word for what felt like hours and just stared at each other until mom made the first move and hugged me.

“I… I’m so sorry for yelling, mom.”

“It’s okay, I’m sorry for arguing with you.” She adjusted the veil that got shaken out of place when I cried. “Salisek, there was a time when I was worried you’d never find a partner that appreciates you for the woman you are. Then we found Carlos and ever since then I hoped and prayed you’d get your happy ending, and now it’s happening. I just wanted to make sure it was special.”

“I-I know.”

“This isn’t about the dress is it?”

I didn’t want to answer that but I knew what it was really about. I wasn’t even mad at myself. I just wanted to give Carlos a reason to stop working.

“Maybe if he knew he saved a few thousand on the dress he’d take some time off.”

“I think it’s time you did your part as a wife.”

“What do you mean?”

*\[Memory Skip: A Few Hours Later\]*

I came home to Carlos playing with our son and daughter, teaching them their ABC’s. He’s wanted to make sure they were both ready for school.

“A is for…”

Pyon jumped from the couch, “Awpple!”

“Good job, Pyon. B is for…”

Pyon was about to blurt something out before Yalga gently closed his mouth so she could speak, “Batman!”

“That’s my girl!”

I gently closed the door behind me and the small sound it made was enough to make the kids race to hug me. They both called out “Mommy’s home!” making my heart skip a beat in pure happiness. But I had a mission.

“Carlos, we need to speak in our room real quick.”

I needed to be firm like mom said, even though Carlos didn’t know what it was about he relaxed and agreed to meet me there. When we got up I needed to make sure he knew I meant business.

“Yeah hun?” he said.

I took a deep breath and looked at my future husband in his deep and powerful eyes. I couldn’t bend under pressure. I needed to make my demands for the sake of our family.

“I need you to take time off. You need to work less. A maximum of fifty hours a week is enough and that’s pushing it. Working sixty eight hours on **average** is dangerous to your health. I will not stand for it. Oh, and you’re taking tomorrow off so you can take me on a nice picnic and we can spend some time alone together.”

“Babe, I know you’re scared but I’m doing this for- *smack-* Ow! Did… is that a chancleta, for Venlil paws?”

“Yes.”

*Thank you Walmart.*

“I… don’t think I’ve ever been more attracted to you in my life. But- *smack*”

“¡Menos trabajo, más amor! P-Por favor.” (Less work, more love! P-Please.)

“... God, I love you. Okay, I’ll call off. And I’ll stick to ten hour shifts Monday through Friday.”

“Wait, really? Yes! Uh, te amo.” (I love you.)

Carlos lifted me by my shoulders and lowered me into a kiss like he did on our second date. “Te amo más.” (I love you more.)

“Is that a threat?” I countered plainly, simply, and with my hand brushing against the back of my pistol.

“No, newrealmer.” The apprentice replied with a nonchalant, conversational tone of voice, having dropped that momentary rise in intensity. “I am merely referring to this little mixer. Which, I believe, I should allow you to get back to. But just be warned, it would be wise to heed my words. Though I highly doubt this will be the last you’ll be hearing of this, as perhaps *clarification* will be needed to address exactly what is and isn’t *acceptable* and *tolerable*. Then again, I doubt even *that* will be my purview. Oh well…” The apprentice shrugged, cutting himself off and removing the little blanket of darkness before he could get into another one of his long-winded tirades.

The darkness disappeared as abruptly as it’d arrived. Moreover, if the sensor readings didn’t already make it clear, it was now very much evident to me that the shadowy bubble I’d been thrust into wasn’t some kind of portal or spatial anomaly, but a careful manipulation of light; separating our small space from the rest of the gathered crowd. A crowd which, much to my surprise, didn’t seem at all fazed by the scene. If anything, the sudden and inexplicable appearance of the apprentice seemed to only result in the expected nods of respect, and bows of deference.

No words were exchanged between the shadowy apprentice and the gathered group. Instead, only a glare and a nod of respectful warning was given; generating an immediate shift in the atmosphere.

A vibe that immediately read as: *Tread Lightly*.

Silence permeated the immediate aftermath of that encounter. Whilst concern over the apprentice’s actions brewed inside of me, forcing me to consider the implications of this first open attempt at information control, and more worryingly… if he was acting on his own volition or at someone else’s standing orders.

However, despite the general submission to the apprentice’s presence and the unspoken warnings toward the group as a whole, the mileage by which the warning was taken… varied considerably.

The tortle-like-turtle, along with the rest of his group and some scattered compatriots, simply left.

Ladona and a few others remained there for a second longer, before likewise breaking course, returning back to Auris Ping and the rest of their group.

Etholin and the group of crocodiles however, whilst relatively unnerved and cautious, actually took a few steps towards me.

“Well then.” The orange and yellow Viscount Gumigo broke the silence first. “You, newrealmer, are now officially on our sight-map.” He spoke in a manner that because of his cocksure and gung-ho demeanor, made it difficult to determine if that was a particularly good, or a particularly bad thing. Though the fact he also left quickly after saying that, probably implied the sentiment lay somewhere in between.

“We'll have our eyes on you.” One of the crocodiles spoke, using two of his three fingers to point towards his eyes, before shooting them back towards me.

“And our ears too!” The smallest crocodile yapped through a confident grin, before just as quickly bolting off.

This left only the small ferret as the last one standing, as he once more craned his head up higher and higher, just to meet my eyes.

“T-the offer from before still stands, earthrealmer.” Etholin began, generating a brief instance of a privacy screen around us. “The offer to parlay that is. W-with the added caveat of guaranteed discretion on my part.” The ferret’s mild-mannered demeanor remained all throughout, even as he tried his best to infer something *other* than skittish nervousness through his words. “You were leading towards something, a topic which… while admittedly *taboo* and borderline preposterous, entering the realm of absurdity, is one that I very much wish to hear more of. Will you walk with me, Emma Booker?” The ferret gestured towards the second nook. “We don't have much time before the end of this mixer, after all.”

I nodded cautiously, prompting the ferret’s privacy screen to grow stronger with mana radiation, a confirmation that these things *did* take more effort to maintain when in motion.

“I’m flattered they even bothered to entertain my explanations in that case.” I offered, trying to keep the conversation rolling as it naturally veered towards one of the points I wanted to touch on; gauging the crowd from earlier using Etholin’s insight. “After all, it would’ve been much easier to simply disengage and disregard, rather than to engage and actively *humor* my points.”

“Indeed. Though this perhaps due in no small part to the… unconventional and *daring* plays of your vastly inferior hand.” The ferret paused, before quickly correcting himself just as we arrived at the third nook. “I… I meant no disrespect with that of course!”

“No offense taken, at least not at this junction, Lord Esila.” I offered with a sigh, urging him to continue.

“A newrelamer’s deck is often composed of cards stacked against their favor from the moment they step into the nest of intrigue that is the Academy. Your… *unique predispositions*, whilst seemingly a handicap, have been overshadowed by your peers’ classroom performance in the form of your current points, and most notable of all… your library card. Whilst the former is subject to the whims of the academic game, the latter… has become a foundational cornerstone to your lore. *This*, amongst a few other rumors and whispers, has forced the student body to reassess its stance on what would otherwise be an easily-dismissed existence. Indeed I… *applaud* your risk-taking maneuvers during that fateful assembly. Though I can imagine it did not come without its price.”

That latter, almost ominous statement, immediately put me in mind of Auris and the resultant cold war stemming from our two fates that’d become inexplicably linked after that assembly fiasco.

A pause quickly punctuated the scene, with Etholin looking up expectantly, as I took a moment to get a closer look at the third nook and all of its magically-derived shenanigans; namely the battle-lines now drawn into what appeared to be a fully actualized, highly-rendered battlemap, and miniatures of several towns and cities scattered across it.

“All decisions have their prices, Lord Esila.” I offered earnestly, just as the lines in whatever magical RTS game happening in the background behind him were shifting. “Indeed, as much as I appreciate your insight on this matter, this does raise the question—”

*“You backstabbed my third guard unit, Lord Etale!”*

*“Well, YOU lied to me about the shipment of grain, Lady Evrail!”*

I paused, momentarily distracted by the drama quickly manifesting in the background.

“—why exactly do you seem to be more invested in me than most? Now, I’m not saying I’m not appreciative of course. I genuinely, and wholeheartedly, wish to form more bonds amidst an… in your own words — nest of intrigue. However, I am merely curious.”

“Perhaps I see this as a risk worth taking, Cadet Emma Booker.” He offered with a twitch of his ears. “Perhaps, I see that the benefits of discussing matters, of forming at the very least a working relationship, is now worth the potential risks following your elevation from a mere newrealmer, to a *potential player* in the game.”

A momentary silence once more descended following that answer, as I paused to ponder the sincerity behind the ferret’s voice, amidst the growing chaos and rapidly deteriorating battle-lines of the game behind him; towering high-rises and windmills alike, crumbling amidst a barrage of tiny magical missiles hurled to the tune of tiny mana radiation signatures.

However, just before I could formulate an answer, a series of bells suddenly sounded above us, eliciting the attention of not just me and my gathered audience, but the rest of the room as well.

It was around this time that the musical ensemble from one of the nooks came forward, carried aloft on a floating invisible platform, as the ‘MC’ began addressing everyone in the room. “Princes and Princesses, Lords and Ladies… newrealmer… may I have your attention, please! The time for dinner has arrived! As a result, it would be our pleasure once again to serenade the end of today’s mixer.” The ‘MC’ quickly turned towards the *only* other noble on stage, who just as quickly began performing.

The question of just *how* a singular person would be able to play a quartet’s worth of instruments quickly became clear, as disembodied white-gloved hands manifested out of nowhere, and began playing a sharp and whimsical tune.

“It stands to reason that perhaps fate has deemed our conversation stops here, at least for now, Cadet Emma Booker.” Etholin offered.

“There’s more you wanted to touch base on?”

“Y-yes. There is a proposition I wish to pose to you, on the matter of this weekend’s sojourn into Elaseer, and on another matter more pertinent to your time here within the Academy and its many, *many* factions.”

*So that’s what his angle is?*

“If it’s a simple nonbinding talk, then sure. Maybe tomorrow after class? Or maybe after Friday’s PE class? As long as nothing else comes up of course.”

“Those are indeed acceptable time frames, Cadet Emma Booker.” Etholin nodded deeply, before taking a few careful steps back. “Till we meet again.”

The sun had begun setting at this point, and as the music prepared to draw to a close, so too did everyone’s formerly talkative spirits.

The wrap-up process was somber, and was rather distinct for each of the little nooks within the lounge. The first nook, with Ilunor and Rostario, seemed to be tallying up some sort of a scoreboard that floated in mid air, far above the reaches of the pair’s short little arms.

The second nook however seemed to be dealing with *a lot* of cleanup work, as the animated paper birds, dragons, gryphons, and dragon-wyvern-gryphon hybrids were practically torn to shreds by the end of it. Whatever animated battle had transpired, I was apparently not privy to. But I made an immediate mental note to both myself and the EVI to focus on that nook the next time around.

The third nook, the one I’d seen towards the tail end of the *mixer*, was my *main fixation* at this point however; as the students here seemed to be tallying and wrapping up what was effectively a magically actualized version of a hybrid between a real-time strategy and a table-top roleplaying game. Except instead of holograms, they dealt with fully autonomous physical miniatures, small representations of anything from your archetypal knight to what looked to be a heavily armored… dare I say it, renaissance looking APC… if that was even a thing. I tended to stay away from *fusion* fantasy stories, being known as a stickler for *minimally invasive crossover* settings, so I’d need to look this over with the EVI *after* work was done. Many of the miniatures however lie in tatters, mauled and torn apart across the mini battlefield. But just like the second nook, this mess didn’t seem to be a problem; a series of magical spells restored every model back to their original condition.

Though following the cleanup, I’d expected the tensions from earlier to spiral into some form of a duel. Similar to how Ilunor and Rostario had seemingly been riled up from what amounted to a minor confrontation.

This, surprisingly, didn’t happen. Instead, and much to my surprise, the group just ended up shaking hands in a surprising display of sportsmanship.

But while the first three nooks were rather straightforward, the fourth nook… I just couldn’t comprehend. Their incantations of darkness seemed to have brought about some sickening creature that disintegrated into what I could only describe as *liquid shadow* following the call for dinner.

Which left only the fifth nook, who were essentially already packed up, with their musical instruments disappearing either into a burst of smoke or into a small dimensional rift-in-the-wall.

*That*, I’d need to investigate down the line.

For now however, I turned towards the exit, towards the animated painting that had acted as the entryway to the space. One that had now just given up on all pretenses and opened up like a traditional door; exactly as I recalled it on the night of the warehouse explosion.

“So much for all the magical effort that goes into entering the place.” I groaned out, as I regrouped with the rest of the party, but not before Ilunor turned around for one final jab at the hamster.

“You’re a guinea pig, Prince Rostarion!” He seethed, before seemingly out of nowhere, pulling a fruit that looked like a cross between a pineapple and a cantaloup out of his cloak. At which point, he *lobbed it*, directly towards the hamster who deflected it with a flick of his wrist.

This led to what amounted to an impromptu tennis match that followed us from the lounge, into the halls, and even all the way down the stairs, before it finally came to an end at the end of an upper yearsman’s wand. At which point, a few words were exchanged, and the pineapple found itself floating and following the Vunerian down and into the dining hall. It seemed to get closer and closer to his head, only halted when he turned around to glare at it.

“I… I don’t understand what’s going on anymore, Ilunor.” I offered in an exasperated breath.

“It’s *humor*, earthrealmer.” The Vunerian responded somehow pridefully, yet defeatedly at the same time. “You wouldn’t understand.”

=====

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30, Living Room. Local Time: 2000 Hours.**

**Emma**

“So what do you make of it?” I asked the gang after more or less divulging the entirety of my encounters during the little ‘mixer’, now that we’d plopped ourselves down on the couch, with a cone of silence deployed for good measure.

“Lady Ladona was attempting to assert some level of social dominance and intimidation.” Thacea began, taking a sip of some tea she’d ordered in from dinner. “Whether or not that is at the behest of Lord Ping’s request, or one committed on her own volition, does not detract from the fact that her actions are invariably representative of her peer group.”

“To which Emma responded in the *best* way possible.” Thalmin offered with a snarky grin. “Care to revisit that moment you stood your ground against her on your memory shard again, Emma?”

“I’m afraid I have to *insist* on moving forward with the conversation, Thalmin.” Thacea countered, prompting the lupinor to hold back and to simply shrug, urging the avinor to continue.

“The rest of the crowd seemed… as you pointed out to Lord Esila, surprisingly *accommodating* all things considered. Though it’s the encounter with Apprentice Arlan Ostoy that I am most worried about.”

“As am I.” I offered, prompting both of us to stare intently in deep thought.

“The man is obviously trying to halt the divulgence of *hard evidence* to your manaless existence.” Thalmin offered.

“But the *enforcement* aspect of it is nebulous at best.” Ilunor chimed in. “I believe you will see further expansion upon this warning sooner rather than later. For now I believe it would be best if we heeded those warnings, especially considering the delicate situation we are *already* embroiled in.”

I took a moment to take all of that advice in, pausing to consider my next course of action with *that* particular development.

Exhaustion certainly wasn’t something I’d expected to feel this early on in the night. This was especially true when considering that all that had transpired was what amounted to a small social gathering.

Though as my time with the Director had taught me, ‘parties’, and ‘social events’ were two very distinct things. With the latter being less of a party and more of a thinly veiled networking expo disguised under layers of booze, food, and whatever shiny distractions your budget could afford.

But while the *social mixer* seemed to have opportunities for those to pursue their hobbies, namely in the little nooks… the *social event* aspect of it was definitely still there. And as a result, it was still something I desperately wanted to recover from.

Though given my track record…

**“INFIL-DRONE01a has returned-to-base, Cadet Booker.”**

… I should’ve expected that work was going to rear back its ugly head *somehow*.

Moreover, this was all part of the plan, after all.

The expected downturn in activity was expectedly replaced with the anxiety-inducing apprehension of what was to come.

“Alright.” I announced, both towards the EVI, and outwardly towards the rest of the gang. “The spy drone’s back. Are you guys ready to see what’s on it?”

A series of nods quickly followed, with all eyes averting from the dragon-fly like drone currently docking itself back into my suit.

I held my breath as the data began its tentative upload, a nagging feeling coiling from the back of my spine urged me to prepare for the worst.

**“Alert. Probability of stealth compromisation and discovery at 50.27%. Isolate and play moment of stealth parameter endangerment?”**

And I just about let loose the largest sigh of internalized stress I’ve released over the past 48 hours.

This clearly brought on the attention of the rest of the group, as each of them leaned closer towards me.

“There’s a near fifty-fifty chance we’ve been found out.” I explained bluntly. “But there’s only one way to find out.” I quickly began setting up the tablet and its on-board projector, flipping it on its kickstand as the recorded footage started playing, zeroing in on the exact instance of mission endangerment.

The footage revealed what appeared to be the same blank void from my long-winded journey towards the man’s office. The blank unrendered walls, the shadowless bright white fixtures, and the *floatiness* of it all, made it clear exactly *where* we were.

“At least we’re headed towards Mal’tory’s office.” I offered with a half-hearted laugh.

However, as the footage continued, it quickly became clear to all of us that it wasn’t *just* the apprentice that was on the prowl towards the black robed professor’s offices.

In fact, as the camera panned up, it became readily apparent exactly *who* had triggered the stealth alarm.

As it became undeniably clear that the armorer of all people, was now side-eying the drone, cocking his head if only so slightly in the direction of its flightpath.

Throughout all of this however, the apprentice remained locked in her own little world, as she continued talking about subject matters not particularly important, most of which simply related to the class and the more mundane aspects of teaching.

“This is bad.” Thalmin managed out first, sinking the bottom half of his face into his hands.

However, just as those words were uttered, so too did the footage reveal something… *peculiar* about Sorecar’s unfettering gaze.

He *winked*.

Or at least, in his own little way, as a gleam of light reminiscent of a lens flare emanated from the left visor currently in view of the drone.

All four of us just about *lost it* at that point.

As Thacea turned towards me expectedly, looking up at me as if *I* had the answers.

“I… I’m guessing… I mean… He’s perceptive, I’ll give him that. He’s doing something none of the professors could do so far. Heck, not even the apprentice seems to notice. But that wink… I guess…” I paused, before turning towards the EVI. “EVI, any other instances of potential discovery?”

**“Negative, Cadet Booker. This is the only recorded instance that surpasses the tolerable threshold.”**

I took a moment to sink into the armor. “Well, this seems to be the only instance the drone caught anyone or anything else staring directly *at* it.” I explained to the group. “Moreover, there were no instances in which Sorecar actually notified the apprentice about this it seems.” I continued, once more reviewing the EVI’s risk of discovery reports.

“The man seems to be somewhat endeared to you, Emma.” Thacea reasoned.

“Yeah… funny the way things turn out, huh?” I offered, before scrolling towards the start of the mission proper, and began playing.

Everyone now became intently focused on the long stretches of silence as the apprentice and professor duo made their way from the class and towards the dark and imposing double doors of Mal’tory’s office.

It was here however, that the first words from the apprentice directly referencing the man were finally spoken.

“Well here we are.” Larial spoke through a tired sigh.

“The office of the *great* man himself.” Sorecar chuckled darkly, crossing his arms in the process. “Well go on then. Be my guest, Apprentice.”

To which the apprentice nodded, but instead of simply opening the door… she grabbed what appeared to be a small notebook, turning to a page stamped entirely with seals and runes. She took a few steps forward, holding the book up, and outstretching her other hand in what amounted to the most archetypal image of a mage casting a spell I could ever dream up. “Ars la tal te al…” She mumbled in rapid succession, looking visibly silly without my drone’s ability to pick up manastreams due to its limited onboard sensors, and thus giving the gang a small slice of what it was like to see the world through my eyes.

These mumblings however eventually resulted in the doors creaking open, slowly, but surely, and with great strain, being pushed inwards by an unseen force.

“That wasn’t an Academy spell.” Sorecar noted accusingly.

“No, it wasn’t.” Larial acknowledged cryptically, pocketing the book and stowing it away.

“You’re playing a dangerous game, Apprentice.” The armorer spoke with a hint of ominous foreboding, visibly hesitant to cross the threshold and into Mal’tory’s office.

“I’m merely carrying out my duties, and the last I checked, those who carry out their duties are impervious to the ministrations of the games fought amongst the issuers of said duties.”

“You see the world in black and white, Apprentice; a fatal misstep once one enters the throes of the game. And the longer you remain in this rat race, the sooner you will come to realize that you *must* pick a side. Lest you become a liability, or worse, be an intolerable threat to be dealt with.” Those words carried with it what seemed to be a genuine sense of care and concern. Though dour and colored with a severity I hadn’t seen from the armorer so far. Part of me even felt like he could be speaking from experience.

The apprentice only paused for a few seconds, her whole body freezing for a moment as if considering the very real looming threats.

However, no sooner did that realization come did it also dissipate, as she let out a sigh, before pulling out a monocle from beneath her cloak. “You speak as if I have a choice, Professor. Where in reality, the only choice I have is to resign or to obey. In which case, I have little choice at all.” Larial’s eyes wavered as she said that, if only for a moment. “My choice was made the moment I left the crownlands. Moreover, I try my best to see the light in this dire situation. I still see this responsibility as an opportunity for me to also work for *myself*.”

“So you *do* have aspirations for the black-robed position.” The professor surmised.

“No. Not particularly anyways. No, what I meant by my personal responsibilities… is a debt that I must uphold.”

“A life debt, perchance?” The professor reasoned, prompting the apprentice to once more pause.

“A debt is a debt, which must be paid in full all the same.” She reasoned, before once more urging the man across the threshold.

Sorecar did so with a nervous hop, as if preempting some sort of trap which never came.

It was at this point that the pair became silent, as if in awe of the room they were now standing in.

Everything about it… was exactly the same as it was on that fateful night. From the dark and moody bookshelves that lined most of the walls, to the somber and almost mournful pieces of art, furniture, and knick-knacks that looked eerily *fluid* this time around.

Moreover, the centerpiece of the whole room, that anatomical live-model of a dragon, remained exactly as it was.

And even now… I could swear that its eyes were staring at the sole occupants of the room, in a permanent expression of shock and dread.

“I assume you’ve never been in the *prime iteration* of the man’s offices before.” Sorecar reasoned, his gait becoming paradoxically more confident, whilst Larial’s became more and more nervous.

“No. It would seem not.” She expressed through a tentative breath, closing the doors behind them, before going over practically every nook and cranny in the room with both her eyes, and a flight of magical gloved hands. “It would seem as if he didn’t trust me enough to allow me entry into his *true* domain.”

“Understandable.” Sorecar shrugged. “But that begs the question, exactly *how* did you come across that seal-breaker?”

“As I said before, Professor. I’ve been assigned this responsibility by three authorities simultaneously.”

“Let’s see… the weak-willed young Vanavan?”

“Yes.” The apprentice nodded, now kneeling in front of the chair I’d broken out of half a week ago.

“And the Dean as well, I imagine?”

“Correct.” She nodded again, this time placing her hand over top of the damaged chair, as if inspecting it for signs of tampering.

“And the third, the only one with the key to the *prime iteration* of the black-robed professor's offices… I assume this is a *third party*?”

The apprentice finally paused at that latter question, though it wasn’t clear if it was because she discovered something about the chair, or was more concerned about the question itself.

“Yes.” She finally responded after a tentative few seconds, moving over towards the back of Mal’tory’s desk.

“Am I correct to assume then, that this mysterious third party is some young and aspiring member of the inner guard? A Captain perhaps? Maybe even a Major?”

“I am not at liberty to discuss the nature of my superiors, Professor.” Larial concluded sternly, placing both of her hands atop of Mal’tory’s desk.

“But you just *did*.” Sorecar shot back with a tone of voice that could only be described as amused and cocky.

“I did so in the hopes of *appeasing* your curiosities, professor, to the point where perhaps you would be satisfied with *two* answers out of a total of *three*.” The apprentice responded with a hard *sigh*.

“And you just so happened to have chosen to stop at the *mystery individual* because *that* was perhaps the *juiciest* insight out of all three?”

“I stopped because that just so happens to be the *third* question on your roster, professor. Now please, I need a moment of concentration.”

“Apologies, apprentice.” The man craned his head down in a show of apologetics.

The silence finally prompted Larial to bring out what looked to be a bespoke, intricately crafted, and fancifully adorned magnifying glass. One that was tastefully sized, and looked genuinely *cool* to hold with its cherry-oak handle and its gold and silver decals. I would’ve *killed* to have something like that commissioned out-of-pocket for a Victorian steampunk cosplay. This, coupled with the monocle she had put on not a few moments prior, gave an almost period-appropriate air of some Sherlock Holmes flick; vibing quite well with the room’s Victorian aesthetic.

Even Sorecar of all people seemed to fit weirdly well, as some sort of an eccentric overly curious sidekick to the serious and strait-laced Detective Larial. These dynamic duo vibes would be further tested, as Sorecar continued *pushing* on his previous talking points. “Though, forgive me if I am overstepping my bounds here… but I *do* assume that the seal on your notebook belongs to the inner guard. Dare I say it, it reminds me of a *sub-order* within the guard, the *Beholders of His Eternal Majesty*, to be precise.”

“And what makes you think that, professor?” Larial shot back curiously, cocking her head, but still completely engrossed in whatever it was she was eyeing through that magnifying glass.

“This room we’re in.” Sorecar gestured *aggressively*. “This is its *prime* iteration, the real deal, the *actual* room, not a tertiary, let alone a secondary decoy to be accessed by a lesser seal or an attempt at physical trespassing. Now, for any other office within the castle walls, that access could easily be explained through the utilization of the Dean’s seal. But for a black robed professor’s office? Well… you know as well as I, that no academic authority can grant you access into what is effectively the crownlands’ consulate. I know for a fact, that the last time I entered a black-robed professor’s office with the *Dean’s Seal*, all I saw was the most unconvincing facsimile of the *prime iteration*.”

“I forget sometimes that you were once perhaps an apprentice as well, professor.”

This attempt to connect with the apprentice through personal anecdotes seemed to work for a little bit, before something caused the warmth from the apprentice’s face to fade entirely.

“What is it?” Sorecar urged, noticing the radical shift in their back and forths.

No sooner was that question raised did an audible CLICK soon follow, and the sound of a desk drawer opening filled the stale and stagnant air soon after.

From there, the now-silent apprentice cautiously pulled up two items from the unlocked drawer using some sort of levitation spell; only one of which I recognized from that fateful day.

In one of her hands was the crystal ball I saw Mal’tory stowing away prior to our conversation.

And in the other, was a small notebook bound in bright green leather, one that prompted Ilunor’s eyes to grow wide with worry.

“I believe I have found the last instance of the professor’s *personal* correspondence to the crownlands.” She spoke, placing the crystal ball down on the professor’s desk. “And I also believe, I have found exactly what our dear Dean, and indeed… my third party is looking for.” She placed the notebook on the table. “A list… containing a number of books marked as *recommended reading material for the studious student*… all to be issued *not* by the school’s library, but *the* Library.”

“None of those books are on the course’s recommended reading material list, I imagine.” Sorecar responded darkly and facetiously.

“No. Not a single one, professor. Which can only mean one thing.”

""We found The Library's burned catalog.""

(Author’s Note: Apprentice Arlan Ostoy, the shadow-obscured apprentice, seems to be rather serious in his attempts at obfuscating the truth! We'll just have to see how that plays out haha. However, in spite of that, we see Etholin's interests in Emma growing, as he speaks frankly with her on several matters, and Emma finally confronts him about just why he seems to be so eager to talk to her despite the taboo nature of her very existence! We also see exactly what the five nooks in the student lounge are up to, as I've always wanted to give the magical world just a little bit more whimsy and a lived in sort of vibe with these things happening all around Emma, and just demonstrating that there is indeed multiple stories and characters just living their own lives outside of Emma's story! That's the sort of vibe that I always love and that I hope I'm able to capture with this haha. Also, most importantly, we start to see the footage gathered from Emma's snooping, as we get to see the nitty gritty of Larial's investigation on Mal'tory! I hope you guys enjoy! :D **The next Two Chapters are already up on Patreon if you guys are interested in getting early access to future chapters!**)

Te Section

Te-A. What would you consider to be productive work? How would you measure this? What are some factors that may affect someone or something’s efficiency? Provide some examples.

Productive work is if you are fast and good in executing the task at hand. I would measure this by giving a person a task and compare how fast, comprehensive, and accurate this person completed the task compared to others. Factors which could influence efficiency are sleep, personality, mental health, or other outside factors like distraction...

Te-B. Think of a time where you needed to complete a difficult task. How did you approach managing the workflow? Why? How can you tell apart logical and illogical workflows or methods of action?

I managed the workflow by preparing myself with nutrition water and then I came up with a tactic, for example my exams tactic was skipping every question I did not have an approach for after about one minute. That way I got through all the easy tasks first and then I had enough time to go back to the trickier ones. I can tell a logical and illogical apart from each other by looking at the outcome and observing which workflow arrived at a better result or faster.

Te-C. How can someone make a set of rules or instructions easy to follow? When people aren’t properly following directions or procedures, how do you correct them? When should you?

First of all, simple language and also try to create a rule that makes sense and therefore can be accepted by people. In the best case you set a goal you want the people to arrive at and make it attractive or rewarding and then you convey that you will arrive at that reward by following the rules. If people aren’t following the rules I will tell them straight up, as long as I also see the meaning and logic behind the rule, and then I will explain to them why this rule is important. I think you should correct people if their rule breaking affects someone or something for example the efficiency or the teamwork.

Te-D. What would you consider a normal level of activity? Is it always necessary to maintain this? Why or why not? How can you tell if someone is overexerting or under exerting themselves?

I think different people have different levels of activity. No, it is not necessary to maintain this normal level at all times, but it can of course come with consequences especially if we are talking academic or workplace performance. I think I notice when people are overexerting through them acting stressed, tiered or maybe a bit obsessed. If someone is under exerting, I notice that through them showing signs of boredom, no enthusiasm or interest in the task.

Te-E. Think of an activity you’re interested in which requires certain physical or mechanical skills. How would you differentiate a good and bad technique? What makes these techniques effective or ineffective? How aware of you of your own performance?

I would differentiate a good or bad technique by again checking how efficient this person arrives at the wished outcome. I would differentiate between effective and ineffective technique by trying and finding out which on is the fastest and most accurate. I think I’m pretty aware of my performance and always criticize myself, reflecting on what I should’ve done better.

Fe Section

Fe-A. To what extent does someone’s emotional state affect a person’s being? How does your emotional state affect your everyday life? When does your true emotional state differ from what you express?

Emotions can affect a person’s being drastically imo. I someone feels anxious or depressed that can have serious consequences on that person’s life. My emotional state affects my everyday life in form of motivation and in general enthusiasm. My true emotional state differs from what I express if I don’t want people to know what I feel.

Fe-B. How important is it for someone to be inspired and excited about what they’re doing? Why? How can people actively inspire others?

Very important, it is a mayor drive in productivity, and it gives you meaning. People can actively inspire others, by doing and being good at what these people find desirable.

Fe-C. What role do negative emotions, including anger, play in people’s lives? What causes them? Are they intrinsically valuable? Why or why not? What can be learned from negative emotions?

Negative emotions can literally destroy people’s life or lead them into even deeper bad emotions. Bad emotions can be caused by having no drive or goal in life or it can be caused by having no belonging or community you are accepted by, but there are a dozen different reasons and people can also be affected by different things. Yes I think bad emotions are intrinsically valuable, because we can learn from them and about ourself, how they are triggered and why we feel them.

Fe-D. In your view, what does it mean to be calm? How can someone reduce the amount of emotionality happening in others around them? When would it be appropriate to adjust this?

It means to react thoughtfully and really thinking about the situation and its different perspectives before deciding for or against something. If someone want’s to reduce the amount of emotionality in others around them, I think you should act confident, reassuring but still realistic. I think it is appropriate in many situations, especially in tense situations where people are nervous or exited.

Fe-E. How can you tell how someone is feeling? Describe some signs to look for. What are some giveaways that someone’s internal state is different from what they’re expressing on the outside?

Face expression and body posture are a big giveaway, when trying to tell how someone feels. You can for example check if someone is looking behind him or around a lot, then he is probably nervous. Some giveaways that someone’s internal state is different from what they’re expressing on the outside are a difference in tone of voice or just agreeing with you and then staying silent without really saying how they feel about the situation.

Se Section

Se-A. To what extent does an individual’s appearance and external presentation affect them? How aware are you of the way you come off? Should people always consider how they look? Why or why not?

An individual’s appearance can affect them in many ways, but especially in how they are perceived by others. I think I’m pretty aware of the way I appear most of the time except for when I’m really glad or intoxicated, then I do not really care that much. I do think people should consider how they look, because first impression is very important and when you are aware of how you appear you can influence how people will remember you.

Se-B. Describe your view on money. What can it do for someone, and how does access to it affect people? What are your thoughts on riskier approaches to attaining it, such as risky investments or criminal activity?

I think money is important and it plays a big role in what opportunities you have. Access to money can affect people differently, some might get arrogant, but others might be generous and will try to help and share with those without access. I think a risky investment is your choice and if you have thought about it carefully assessing all the risks and you still think you want to go for it then do it. Criminal activity on the other hand I find mostly stupid or selfish.

Se-C. What would you consider your short and long term material goals? How do they compare to the goals of others? How can you tell if someone is striving for the right goals?

My short term goals are for example making my bed or packing my stuff and my long term goals are creating a business or developing an app. I feel like my goals compared to the goals of others are a bit more ambitious, but I think that really depends on what environment you are in. I can’t really tell if someone is striving for the right goals since a goal is something really personal and could feel wrong for me but right for them.

Se-D. What makes a person or organization look “put-together”? Are these people and groups more able to exert their will over others? Why or why not? What makes a person good at organizing and directing the will of themselves and others?

People striving for a goal look more put-together. Yes, I think so since a common goal makes them work together and the majority with the most power are able to exert their will over others. A person good at organizing and directing the will of themselves and others knows how

to charm people and find common ground with them. He also knows how to convince peolpe of his idea.

Se-E. One famous English adage is that “If there is a will, there is a way.” Do you agree? Why or why not? To what extent an individual’s will affect their ability to accomplish their goals?

I do agree that our motivation very much influences if we accomplish our goal or not, but there are also factors you can’t influence as much, for example height or intelligence.

Ne Section  
Ne-A. What would you consider to be the essence – or meaning – of existence? Should life’s

meaning be personal or collectively shared by humanity? Why?

I think the meaning of existing is that you are exploring, understanding, enjoying, and helping. I don’t think it should be shared collectively and imo you must find you own meaning, to really enjoy and fully understand it.

Ne-B. What makes someone have potential? What makes an individual more capable at something than others? When is it important to consider these capabilities? Can a person be truly hopeless? Why or why not?

Potential for me is what you were given and didn’t work for to get. So your genes and also what situation you were born into. An individual can be more capable at something than others because of several reasons, for example being tall as a basketball player or being intelligent as a theoretical physicist, but it can also have personality reasons like hard working, social or agreeable. I think it is almost always important to consider these capabilities, but I think that you shouldn’t just give up and that hard work can make up for lack of inherent abilities. I don’t think a person can be truly hopeless, but oftentimes these people need someone who gives them the opportunity to change or opens their eyes to other possibilities, and that can take time.

Ne-C. What must an individual understand to physically and spiritually develop themselves? Is it more important to recognize the flaws or the strengths that people are given? Why?

You must understand that it takes time and effort. If it is challenging to go in this direction then it is probably the right direction. I think it is more important to look at the strengths of a person. Don’t make a fish climb a tree. You will have to find the right thing something you good at, but still challenges and motivates you.

Ne-D. How would you determine how good an idea is? Do these ideas need to be realistic to be worthwhile? How would you differentiate a promising opportunity from a dead end?

I think the definition of a good idea can be broad. Some ideas might not work in reality, but can still be inspirating as a story or art work. I would differentiate a promising opportunity

from a dead end, by thinking about the possibilities I get if I take the one or the other. The one with more possibilities to learn is probably the one I’ll take.

Ne-E. What does it mean for someone to understand the “essence” of something? When should someone prioritize understanding the core characteristics of a phenomenon? Think of a topic or field of interest you are knowledgeable in. What do you think lies at the essence of it? What does this suggest about the way people should approach it?

It means to understand the underlying idea behind a broader concept. I think understanding the core characteristics of a phenomenon can be very helpful when you want to learn about it and apply it in different ways. Often times it is easier to understand the basic idea before you get into all the technical details. Example, at the essence of art there is to deliver a message. This suggest that people who want to approach art should think about what do I want to tell the world and how can I deliver that message through my piece of art.

Ti Section

Ti-A. What would you understand as an individual’s basic needs? Are these the same for everyone? To what extent do people rely on others to get their needs met? At what points does this become overreliance or underreliance?

An individual’s basic needs are food and community. Yes, these are the same for everyone, although some might need different amounts. Others rely very much on others to get their needs met, alone the food we are dependent on is produced and marketed by thousands of different people. We have always been dependent on others and only very few people are truly autonomous today.

Ti-B. How do people gain leverage, power, and respect from others? Is it sometimes necessary to use threats, fear, and punishment to accomplish this? Why or why not?

They can gain power and respect from others through having extraordinary abilities (intelligence, empathy, talking...), taking initiative or having common values and taking the lead. You can also use less ethical methods like manipulation. No, I don’t think it is necessary to use threats, fear, and punishment to gain respect, because you can also get respect by doing something good for someone else or advising them when they have struggle taking a decision.

Ti-C. One commonly used idiom is that “Everything has its place.” What does this mean to you? How do things being “in their place” contribute to orderliness? Do you agree with the idiom? Why or why not?

To me this means that everything has a meaning and place. Orderliness is quite literally having things in their place. I do agree with the idiom when it comes to people, because I think that everyone has a place in this world, you just must find the place where you fit in. Maybe there are people who truly don’t belong anywhere.

Ti-D. What makes hierarchies work? When are they appropriate to use, and what do they provide to people? Should they always strive for equality and justice? Why or why not?

Hierarchies can work for different reasons. Some work because of fear of the powerful others work because of trust into a selected minority like politicians. You can also have a common set of beliefs and leverage those who support and advocate for these beliefs into a higher ranked group. Hierarchies can provide a sense of leadership and direction and they can also provide people with security by enforcing a set of rules the general population agrees with. They can of course also be bad and result in tyranny. Generally I think that they should always strive for equal opportunity, rights and status, but we shouldn’t see everyone as equal. Some people need more help than others and some need to be challenged more. I think especially in education thinking of everyone as equal would be a very big mistake.

Ti-E. What does it mean for something to be logical? Is this the norm? Provide an example of something logical and illogical, and compare what makes the first logical and the second not.

If something is logical it is also consistent, coherent, valid, rational and systematic. Yes, this should be the norm since logic is a universal principle and basically the language for explaining what is true or false.  
Logical:

Premise 1: All humans are mortal. Premise 2: Socrates is a human. Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Illogical:

Premise 1: All cats have tails.  
Premise 2: Some animals have tails. Conclusion: Therefore, all animals are cats.

The first one is logical, because it is based on the two true premises and makes rational conclusion based on the facts given. The second one is not logical, because it assumes that all animals are cats just because some animals have tails and cats happen to have those to.

Fi Section

Fi-A. What does it mean to be emotionally close to or distant from someone? In what ways can you adjust your “emotional distance” to someone else? For what reasons would you decide to do this?

To be emotionally close to someone means for me to know the person, what they value, what makes them sad and what they like. Distant would be the opposite. You can decide to distant yourself from a person through not talking to them anymore, then you will not exchange values and opinions with each other, so you don’t know as much about the person. Some people decide to do this, because they do discover that they don’t like the person as much as they thought they would, for whatever reason and the decide to distance themselves.

Fi-B. Share some thoughts on how you view love and desire. What makes a person desirable? Is this the norm? Are some people more deserving of these than others? Why or why not?

For me a person is desirable if I can talk to the person, and we can openly share our opinions and discuss why or why not we think the other person is wrong. Ideally this person is also intelligent, open, outgoing, and confident. No, this is not the norm, every person has different priority’s and traits which they find desirable. I do think that some people are more deserving of love than others and their actions and how they treat others. I think that those who treat others kindly are more deserving of kindness than those not treating others with kindness.

Fi-C. Describe what morality means to you. What does it mean for something or someone to be good or bad? What does it take for something bad to become good? Are some things truly irredeemable? Why or why not?

Morality to me is a set of rules one creates and tries to follow. These rules can be thought of by others (the state, church...) or by yourself. If someone is good or bad varies depending on what moral code you follow. If something or someone bad wants to become good then it has to follow the moral code and take the punishment for it’s wrong doings. If somethings truly are irredeemable again depends on what set of rules you follow, personally I think it really depends on the specific scenario, but killing can be irredeemable under some circumstances.

Fi-D. How are people shaped by their relationships with their friends and family? How do these differ from romantic ones? Are non-romantic relationships more important than romantic ones? Why or why not?

People are shaped by their family and friends in various ways, they often share common values or adopt the values of these people and share similar experience. Romantic relationships differ from these, because we choose them, and we choose them from different criteria. For example most people choose someone they are attracted to both personality wise and sexually/physically. Personally I think both are very important, romantic can really shape a very deep bond, but family will always stay and you can’t choose it and for me personally I think that family is my biggest priority.

Fi-E. What can establishing new relationships with people do for someone? Is making new contacts with others as important as deepening the ones people already have? Why or why not?

It can give you new experiences and perspectives. I think that making new friendships is not as important as deepening the ones you already have since you already selected these people deepening a bond will give you someone for life you always can trust and I think it is really important to have someone you can trust.

Si Section

Si-A. One of the key themes in the bestselling book Atomic Habits is that what people have in their surrounding environment is the greatest subconscious driver of how they live their life. Do you agree? Why or why not? How can changing the environment around someone impact the way they live their life?

I do agree to some extend that our environment has a big influence on us, but since we shape our environment with our thoughts and ideas, for example what our room or work evironment

looks like, I think that our mind has a big influence on that. Changing the envorinment can influence us for example in learning. If I want to learn to play piano and my piano is in the second floor and my room in the first floor I will have to make an effort to get to play, but if I place the piano directly in my room I will have less effort to start playing and therefor practice more often.

Si-B. How should people approach managing their health and well-being? How does this compare to the way you approach your own? When should people be taking their health and well-being into account? Why?

They should inform themselves about how they should shape their diet and they should practice some kind of activity or sport, like running, biking. They should also take time for their hobbies and themselves to self-reflect. This is about how I manage my own health and well- being, my diet could be a bit healthier, but my active nature allows me to eat more unhealthy stuff, which is a habit I want to get rid of. People should always take their health and well- being into account, because it is tied to so many things like mental stability and also performance.

Si-C. Think about the way sensations, both good and bad, shape the way people live and experience their lives. How important are experiencing good sensations in one’s life? Is there a limit to how much one should chase these? What role do negative sensations play in our lives?

I think that good sensations aren’t super important, but they definitely add flavor to your life and personally I really like experiencing different physical activities and sensations. Yes, I think ther is definetly a limit to when people should stop a certain sensation, and it is called addiction. When it gets to a point where you disregard your imp

Si-D. Choose one of the following: art, clothing, photography, graphic design. What makes something well-designed in that area? How do the individual components work together to generate the experience?

Something well designed in art is not only aesthetic, but also has a story or a message it wants to tell. The art is the carrier of the message, but it still very important to deliver the message in a powerful way.

Si-E. Describe what your living & working environments are like. How do they affect you? Would other people be similarly affected in the same environment? Why or why not? What changes could you make to improve it? How would these be beneficial?

Ni Section

Ni-A. How do people’s relationship to the past, present, and future influence the way they currently live their lives? To what extent does this affect them? How does this influence your own life?

They influence them to the point where they control some people. It really depends how you look at the different dimensions. Some people are super pessimistic about the future and therefore don even try to do anything about it since they already see everything doomed. These people are highly influenced by their outlook on the future. People with a positive outlook might see the future as a playground with endless opportunities and potential. The past can influence us if we look back too much. For example, a person who always dwells on past experiences might miss many opportunities. On the other hand a person looking back at their mistakes once in a while might gain a lot of insights and is better prepared for future situations. A person living to much in the present will forget what consequences his actions might have in the future, while a person not enough in the present might miss a lot of opportunities.

I would say that our outlook on these three dimensions can control our life or make us smarter more efficient and better. My own life is also affected by these. I am a person who likes making plan and being prepared, but I also like to welcome the futures different paths and possibilities. Sometimes I can get a bit too stuck up in past and future and miss out on opportunities in the here and now. I’m slowly getting better at taking opportunities as they come, but it is still way nicer to be prepared.

Ni-B. What does it mean for a person to be at a certain “phase” of their life? What puts people into the phases they’re currently in? How does this affect the way people navigate their lives?

It means that they arrived at a state where they go through a specific environment (both physically and psychological) for a certain period of time. They can be put into to a phase through a event which changes their live to some degree, for example changing school or learning about a new topic. This affects people and how they navigate their life, because they change and have to learn every time they enter a new phase. If I for example, go to a new country I will automatically adopt and learn the way the behave in this country and that will influence how I make decisions and act.

Ni-C. How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe them unfolding in your environment? How do you adjust yourself towards the way things are developing? Provide some examples.

There are always some details or hints which I connect in a logical way to derive what could likely happen next. These hints can be body language, facial expression, or simply visual things, like a wet floor and a person running. It can also be a verbal hint or my memory reminding me that I have been in a similar situation before. I can observe them unfolding by simply watching. I adjust myself to the way things are developing in the way were I can gain the most or run the least risk. For example if I see people riding their bike very unstable and I want to overtake, I will immediately adjust my overtake and try to have as much distance to the person as possible and a way out if this person happens to fall or make a sudden turn.

Ni-D. Think about the way you experience the pace and rhythm of your life. What dictates the speed in which time flies? Why do you think people experience time passing at different rates?

For me excitement dictates the way time flies. If I’m working on my own project which I am passionate about, then time will pass pretty quickly, but if I sit at a dinner table with my grandparent’s time feels like it is going in slow motion. I think that people experience time passing at different rates can be due to different factors. Some people might simply be better at guessing how much time they spend on thing or the other or it is again dependent on excitement.

Ni-E. Consider each of the following feelings people have about time: hurriedness, anxiety, optimism/pessimism. What causes people to experience these feelings? What role do they play in our lives? To what extent are these feelings beneficial?

I think people have these feelings because time is limited and unknown. These feeling have a big role in our life, and we can be controlled by them if we aren’t careful, but they can also be a good tool if we understand why we have them."

"If you want some beginner Te Reo Māori sentence structures, here you go",auckland,1d34utb,2024-05-29 01:40:28,29,0.61,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/1d34utb/if_you_want_some_beginner_te_reo_māori_sentence/,Kaloggin,Discussion,"I'm still learning too, so if I've made any mistakes, just let me know in the comments!

To speak about something happening now, you can use either of the below sentence structures. They come from different dialects of Te Reo Māori. They're both equally understood and mean the same thing:

Kei te + verb + pronoun.

Or

E + verb + ana + pronoun.

..............

Verbs:

Hiahia = want

Haere = go

Kai = eat

Inu = drink

..............


Pronouns:

Ahau = I

Koe = you

 
..............


Put them together:

Kei te hiahia ahau.

E hiahia ana ahau.

I’m wanting.

 
..............


Kei te haere ahau.

E haere ana ahau.

I’m going.

 ..............

Kei te kai koe.

E kai ana koe.

You’re eating.

 ..............

You can just change the tone a little or add a question mark to make it a question:

Kei te inu koe?

E inu ana koe?

Are you drinking?

 ..............

From here, we’ll just use ‘kei te’ to make it simple. But the same sentence structures can be used with ‘e… ana…’ as well.

..............

Add on some extra words:

Kei te + verb + pronoun + i + this/these/that/those.

These words with a ‘t’ are singular, without a ‘t’ are plural.

This = tēnei

These = ēnei

That (near someone you’re talking to) = tēnā

Those (near someone you’re talking to) = ēnā

That (away from you and the person you’re talking to) = tērā

Those (away from you and the person you’re talking to) = ērā

..............


Put it together:

Kei te hiahia ahau i tēnei.

I’m wanting this.


Kei te kai koe i tēnā?

Are you eating that?


Kei te inu ahau i ēnā.

I’m drinking those.

..............

Add more to the sentence:

Kei te + verb + pronoun + i + te/ngā + noun.

Te = the (singular)

Ngā = the (plural)

In Te Reo Māori, you don’t add an ‘s’ on the end of a word to make it plural, instead you change the words before it.

Kei te hiahia ahau i te motokā.

I’m wanting the car.


Kei te hiahia koe i ngā kurī?

Are you wanting the dogs?


Kei te kai koe i te kai?

Are you eating the food?

..............

Add some more to the sentence:

Kei te + verb + pronoun + ki te + noun.


Kei te haere ahau ki te kura.

I’m going to the school.

 

Kei te haere koe ki te whare?

Are you going to the house?

 ..............

Add some more:

Kei te + verb + pronoun + ki te + verb.


Kei te hiahia ahau ki te kai.

I’m wanting to eat.

Vs

Kei te hiahia ahau i te kai.

I’m wanting the food.


Kei te hiahia koe ki te haere?

Are you wanting to go?


Kei te hiahia ahau ki te inu.

I’m wanting to drink.

 ..............

Add some more:

Kei te + verb + pronoun + ki te + verb + ki te/ngā + noun.


Kei te hiahia ahau ki te oma ki te kura.

I’m wanting to run to the school.


Kei te hiahia koe ki te hīkoi ki te motokā?

Are you wanting to walk to the car?


Kei te hiahia koe ki te taraiwa ki te toa?

Are you wanting to drive to the store?

 ..............

Change the tenses – past and future. All that is needed is to change ‘kei te’ to the below words. Everything else stays the same:

Past = kei te -> i

I hiahia ahau ki te haere ki te toa.

I wanted to go to the store.


I kai ahau i tēnei.

I ate this.

 

Future = kei te -> ka

Ka haere ahau ki te kura.

I will go to the school.


Ka inu koe i tērā?

Will you drink that (away from both you and the one you’re speaking to)?

\- - - - -

Things were heading in the right direction for Harrison. The hand-held mining equipment was fabricated, drones were set to patrol and detect any incoming swarms, the settlement’s food situation was practically solved, and he had finally settled on how he would procure gunpowder.

Once again, the engineer was in the workshop late at night. Everyone else had enjoyed their dinner and gotten settled in for the night, leaving only him, Tracy, and a sleeping Shar in the building. There was little else to do at the moment, given that any factory line setup would simply be collecting dust until he figured out where he’d be getting potassium for the saltpeter, so he elected to busy himself by tackling some minor problems.

Take the lack of textiles for clothing and equipment, for example. They weren’t hard to make, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have to procure the materials and set the fabricator to work. Thankfully, he still had an abundance of pseudomycelium left to form synthetic fibers, so the only difficulty there was putting the two machines together. It wasn’t too hard of an ask to do by himself, but he was quickly learning firsthand why the Malkrin were vital.

He grunted in exertion as he channeled every ounce of his strength into his legs, his back starting to bruise from the sheer force placed against his muscles and the hard steel behind him. His breaths turned into ragged gulps for air, his feet struggling with each step over the floor ‘specifically designed to make modular processes easy to assemble.’ The pressure of his clenched teeth reached a painful crescendo as he finally brought the synthetic loom to its final position beside the fabricator.

He slid down the side of the machine, letting his strained inhales settle. Christ, he should have just woken Shar up and had her deal with moving the several-hundred-kilogram blocks of wires. It was too late now, though. A dry cough left him as he pushed himself off the floor and to his feet, approaching his desk.

“Hey…” Tracy’s soft voice stopped him in place. “Harrison?” She had rolled away from her drone-component-cluttered desk to face him, her head held low with a guilty expression residing on her face.

He tiredly raised a brow, his voice coming out in a deadened drone. “What’s up?”

She fiddled with the straps on her dirtied overalls nervously. “I know you just moved that machine, b-but we’re, uh, out of metal…”

His unintentional sigh trounced the fabricators’ hum and the quiet electronic music Tracy had playing through the speakers above her workspace. “Alright… I can recycle another table.”

She waved her hands in protest. “No, no. I just wanted to let you know. You don’t have… to…”

But he was already shuffling his sore legs to the other side of the building. He really didn’t mind using the recycler to help her out. If she finished her drones and set them to work finding ocean deposits, it would just about tie up all that the machines needed to produce gunpowder, and they’d be one step closer to locking down the settlement’s security.

An annoying screech cried out from the table scraping against the floor, egging a small, gnawing headache on, but the task was over quickly. His muscles felt like liquid as he hauled the brutalist furniture up and into the recycler. It hummed and produced the glorious shiny material in no time, meaning Tracy was able to continue her tinkering.

He returned to his desk, roughly falling into his chair, barely noticing the blurriness around his peripheral vision. Nor did he notice the ever-present static along his skin fade into numbness 

His fingers sat on his keyboard, ready to start the textile process, but they refused to begin. He stared at his unmoving hands, confused. The command just didn’t click. It was simple, but his own limbs… couldn’t. Did they forget how to?

His eyes meandered from where he wanted to focus, pressure rapidly building in his head. The drain of nausea swiftly crept up on his disoriented mind, hitting him like a mean uppercut. It pulled his vision to and fro as he concentrated on keeping his head steady.

He couldn’t feel his own hands as he dragged them to the edge of the table to get a hold of himself, his grip uncertain.

Everything spun faster and faster, the objects in his vision becoming nothing but blurs. His stomach churned as he pulled his chair closer to the desk, crossing his arms on top and throwing his head into them in a last-ditch effort to stabilize *something*.

He shut his eyes.

His heart sunk, chest dropping the moment his lids closed. The world fell out from beneath him, the black abyss of his vision suddenly forming a bottomless pit, throwing him into its gaping maw.

\- - - - -

Frigid air bit at his skin, his head spun, and short-lived thoughts washed through his brain as brief flashes of indistinct memories burned his vision like sun spots. Cryo pods, AI cores, and exposed flesh marred the faint shreds of his lucid mind.

…Where?

His eyes opened. He was standing in a valley of orange rocks, stumbling toward a cliff face within the mountainside. Everything was consumed by a white fog, blurred further by a smeared mask. Wind kicked up sand and dry dirt, washing it across the expanse like waves. The world was shown to him in a slideshow of images, each blink of his translating a time skip of several seconds as he traveled a wasteland of dust and stone. The crackle of earth beneath his feet echoed ethereally through the desolate biome, complimented by suppressed yet heavy breaths.
 
…What?

He felt sick, his head barely kept from lolling to the side as he tried to focus on what lay in front of him. His legs were water, unsteadily keeping him upright, heightening every aspect of his vertigo. A heavy weight within his arms dragged him down, yet he never looked down to observe it. His sights were only set on the sheer mountain face, a small beeping noise getting progressively louder as he approached. He felt like an observer, only experiencing the world through anothers’ perspective.

…Why?

A large metal blast door was embedded in the rocky wall, its corroded alloy peering from behind a particularly large boulder. He approached it, a spike of dulled anxiety striking his neck. Its exterior was dirtied by orange dust that obscured a small emblem on its surface.

*A thousand fires burn within the land.*

His hand wiped the soot off, revealing a simple insignia of an open palm showcasing a depiction of D.N.A.

*Extinguish the failure once more.*

He twisted the archaic valve and opened the door.

*Shepherd the successful.*

He entered the black abyss beyond the entrance.

*Reclaim what they abandoned.*

\- - - - -

Harrison’s eyes shot open as he sat up from the… bed? His breathing was rapid, but it quickly slowed as he took in the surrounding room. It was the bunk room, though dim and empty. He rubbed his eyes, blinking away the last vestiges of sleep.

‘*A thousand fires burn within the land.*’

So that was… a dream? Right. It didn’t exactly feel real, but it also hadn’t felt disconnected like the slumbering visions usually did…

Wait, he fell asleep? His eyes widened. That was… *good*. Amazing even. He couldn’t feel the static along his skin anymore, nor did he feel nauseous, which implied whatever was in his system had passed—Ceras tincture *and* the Rad-Away. That didn’t stop his muscles from feeling bruised and dried out, however. It also didn’t explain how he got to the barracks when the last thing he remembered was breaking his back putting some textile machine into place.

…Shar probably brought him here since he fell asleep. He sighed and slid out of… her… bed. Huh. He noticed his equipment placed neatly up against the wall and went to grab it. The familiar weight of the over-encumbered load-bearing rig tugged on his spine in just the same way his modified shotgun strained his arms. At least he was getting used to them after all this time.

The room’s door slid open with a short ‘woosh,’ forcing him to wince from how the lights in the hallway were still bright, which told him it was sometime during the day. How long was he asleep? He had been making up for three nights of sleep; no way it was just eight hours, right? God, he hoped he didn’t lose too much of the day. He had to divvy out the new weapons and start harvesting ore, and he knew damn well that wasn’t going to be a simple one-hour operation. That could wait another minute or two.

He meandered to the bathroom to relieve himself and wash his face. Someone was using the shower, but he didn’t bother checking who. Instead, he washed his hands and got slightly distracted by staring at himself in the mirror, noting how different he looked from what he last remembered. Obviously, there were shadows beneath his green eyes. His hair and beard were kept reasonably groomed by his fiddling hands and the daily shower, though they both differed drastically from the short side part and clean-shaven face he had when coming in as a pioneer… He’d have to shave again pretty soon if he wanted to keep using his gas mask.

He brought his arms up and rotated them around, inspecting the various healed scars and currently mending wounds from the previous blood-moon. They marred much of the skin over his surprisingly defined limbs. The amount of work he did on a day-to-day basis mixed with his fish-based diet seemed to have burned much of the fat he once had, only leaving toned muscles. Hell, even his callused hands looked worn out like a mech operator’s, *especially* around where he held his shotgun.

Two clicks from his side broke his attention, followed by Sharky’s voice, her words coming out almost… lightheartedly? *“Are you admir—g your figure, Harrison?”*

He regarded her with a raised brow before raising a second at seeing her shirtless form by the shower section’s doorway, revealing the white skin of her torso and abs, its soft coloring fading into the maroon around the rest of her limbs and face. He almost looked away before he realized that Malkrin females really didn’t have anything to hide—thank God she already had her black mechanic’s jeans on; he was happy not knowing how far that difference went. “Uh… yeah? Sorta?”

She made her way to his side, putting a towel and bundles of clothing down atop the array of sinks, her head hunched partially underneath the ‘low’ ceiling. *“You have not slept long en—gh to lose your strength, if that is w—t you wish to know. I am happy to see you awake, h—ever.”*

He gave her a curious look. “You say that like I’ve been out for days. How long was I asleep for?”

*“You h–ve slept through the night and much of the day. Rest as—red, sunset is not upon us yet”* She slipped her poncho on, doing the same with her rig, zipping it up with a practiced motion.

Damn. He internally groaned, turning the sink on and splashing his face with the cold water.

*“Harri—n?”*

“Yeah?”

She tilted her head quizzically. *“I was mean—g to ask you earlier, but was unable… Are star-sent males m—nt to be taller than the females?”*

What kind of question was that? “Uh… yes? Typically, anyway.”

*“I figured s—h was true.”* She nodded, putting one of her many hands atop his head horizontally, tracing his height back to herself and confirming his height reached a few inches above her navel. *“You are quite feminine with y—r abnormal height and gifted strength—much more than one would a—ume of a male.”*

He squinted at her, an incredulous look covering his visage. The pieces clicked together at a glacial pace under his uncaffeinated mind. Feminine…? Him? Shar? Oh… Yeah… Right. By her standards, he would technically be ‘effeminate’ if that translated to what he thought of as masculine. Then again, it wasn’t an exact switch of sexes, was it?

Shar was gigantic and muscular, but the latter wasn’t overwhelmingly so. It's not that she looked like she was on steroids or anything. It was a lot more refined, the real strength hidden by *extremely* well-defined and ‘moderately-sized’ muscles. Hell, her shoulders weren’t *super* broad either, despite easily eclipsing his own. Furthermore, she had—by his definition of the word—rather feminine eyes and leg shape too. So, it wouldn’t be fair to say that the Malkrin female was directly comparable to the human male. That wasn’t even touching on the four arms, frills, talons… horns… Huh. That was another weird thing. How come some of them had those head growths but others didn’t? The lumberjack and elder had them… and so did Shar. Was it an age thing? He’d ask the others about it later.

He slowly blinked, realizing he must have been staring for a minute. The poor paladin had started to look a little uncomfortable underneath his inspection. Especially considering the slight flush along her snout and cheeks.

“S-Sorry… Uh, yeah, you’d be right in thinking that I’m a bit off-course for a Malkrin male.”

*“Yet, It does not take away from your qualities, d—rest Harrison,”* she added, the sudden overwhelming warmness taking him off guard. Her attention shifted to the door behind him. *“Are you r—dy to leave? Or shall I wait outside for you?”*

“I’m ready to go, thanks.”

\- - - - -

“Alright, now try for the furthest target—the three-hundred-meter one,” Harrison ordered, the grin spread across his cheeks starting to feel sore after being kept up for so long.

Cera nodded, bringing the FAL’s iron sights back to her eye and settling her aim across the rolling meadows down range. An unusable piece of lumber was set up on one of the taller peaks, almost far enough to not be visible.

A resounding *crack* broke through the late evening silence, echoing back several times as the sound reflected throughout the hills. He didn’t even need to use his binoculars; the distant chunk of wood clearly fell down.

He smiled and patted the gentle female on the lower arm. “Well damn… Looks like you’ve just about hit all the targets. You’re a Grade-A Marksman, Cera.”

She returned his mirth with a grin of her own, proudly flicking the safety back on and lowering the firearm just as he showed her. She had managed to take out the ten, twenty, fifty, one-hundred, two-hundred, *and* three-hundred-meter targets with absolute ease, only taking an extra shot or two for the closer ones as she initially got used to the gun. It was a shame the craftsman was too busy in the workshop to see his wife tearing up the range. Not to mention it was all with iron sights, too.

Cera clicked her tongue, garnering his attention. She pointed to the firearm, and then to herself.

“What’s that? Yeah. Again, it’s all yours. You can put these extra mags in your chest pockets if you’d like.” He picked up the extra twenty-round cartridges from a small table placed nearby, handing them to the black-colored Malkrin. She graciously took them and slipped them into place before looking back down at him with a tilted head as if to ask ‘what now?’ “That’s uh, that’s all I got for you. Feel free to return to the workshop whenever. Just remember the three rules of gun safety and make sure not to cause any negligent discharges, yeah?”

She bowed toward him in thanks, leaving the makeshift range for her mate with a skip in her step. The engineer sighed and regarded the wooden table, appreciating the pile of spent casings, various used stripper clips, and the belt-loading machine left on top of it. He’d already gone through teaching Shar and Akula about their weapons throughout the last hour or two, running them through the basics and having them learn their new weapons inside and out. Shar was initially appalled by the idea of disassembling her gifted M2, but quickly fell into line upon realizing that she could put it back together herself after cleaning it. 

All in all, they were ecstatic to be given ‘staffs’ of their own, going through their own song and dance of thanks. The dark green-colored Fisherwoman was given a massive boost to her ego for ‘being entrusted with the star-sent’s power to defend his subjects’ or whatever she said. The paladin was somewhat similar, though she ‘managed’ to conceal her excitement, channeling it into her tail and threatening to crush him with the way it wrapped around him. Speaking of the massive Malkrin…

*“The ceramist made q—te a showing, has she not?”* Shar remarked, stepping up to the opposite side of the table from him, her pet drone’s electric motor whirring as it followed along the ground before doing a cute spin when she stopped.

“Sure did.” He grabbed the last of the three FALs, inspecting it and testing the bolt before briefly bringing up the iron sights too peer down range. The hand guard, charging handle, and trigger complex had been altered to fit the Malkrin’s larger hands, making it a difficult task for him to properly use the empty gun. “First, the syringe a few days ago, and now one of these. Are you sure everyone who works in pottery has an abnormally stone-still grip?”

The maroon-colored female rotated her shoulders, adjusting the weight of the machine gun and shield attached to her back. *“Most of such a profession sp—d many seasons refining their abilities, but I sup—se she is unique in having ach—ved such a mastery of her own limbs.”*

“It is impressive…” He put the firearm down, pushing it toward Shar. “Now, what’re we to do with this last FAL?”

*“Was it not int—ded for Tracy’s use?”*

He shook his head, slightly irked at the reminder. “No, it was. When I went into the workshop to get her, she vehemently refused to use it… She didn’t even want to learn how to shoot it.”

Shar’s head tilted. *“She wishes n–t to be capable of her own def—se?”*

“I don’t know,” he huffed, resting his palms on the table’s coarse wood. “She has her reasons, and I’m not gonna force her to do anything. At least her drones are coming along well… Anyway, do you think I should just recycle this FAL, or let Akula have her dream of duel-wielding them?”

*“Giving Akula a second weapon w—ld not be favorable,”* she returned seriously, taking on a more calculating tone. *“I bel—ve it would be best if more of us were armed, so we might be capable of safely splitt—g up groups to perform other tasks.”*

His brow raised at her idea. “What do you mean by that?”

The massive female held out a palm as if presenting a proposition. *“Earlier, you inf—med me that you wished for us to be able to harvest resources outside the settlem—t’s safety, no?  Like your analogy for the fly—g machines: it allows us to cast a wider net. I do not know if you are capable of prod—ing more of these staffs, or if you wish to give them to others bey—d those you have already blessed, but I bel—ve it would be best if we had more of the set—ement armed.”*

He paused, squinting at the giant female across from him. Did she believe everyone should be given a gun? It was a reasonable take in their dire situation, honestly, but not a decision he was prepared to settle. On the one hand, some Malkrin might get killed by an unseen swarm if they’re undefended and left with only primitive weapons, but on the other, he would be putting advanced technology in the hands of people who might not yet grasp how dangerous it is. It was ultimately his decision whether the rest of the settlement were forced to rely on a select few for their defense, or if they were given the ability to so themselves. He wanted to have a reason to allow everyone that right, but it was gambling on too much… He’d need time to think about it… probably after he was able to actually procure the materials for more firearms. For now, he’d have to see where Shar was going.

He sighed, giving the paladin a flat stare. “We have one last gun here, Shar. I won’t be arming the entire group with it. Give me a good reason to hand this out to someone *specific* instead of the craftsman or Akula.”

*“The g—rdswoman.”*

The engineer’s face turned to that of uncertainty. “The… guardswoman… Really? The yellow, broody one?”

The yellow female was probably the one Malkrin he interacted with the least, besides the ‘juvenile.’ She always looked somewhat spiteful despite never choosing to say anything. He noted her frequently switching from accusatory glares to widened eyes. Honestly, she was the last one he considered, even though her profession and training were *technically* ideal for using the firearm.

His apprehension turned to curiosity. “…Why?”

*“I am not advocat—g for you to hastily give such a powerful w—pon to the newcomer. But, allow me to explain my bias.”* 

The paladin turned to regard the several Malkrin working to harvest the brown-bark wood down the hill from them. A yellow-colored Female stood tall above them, helping out with the hauling between her short patrols, spear always in hand. 

*“She is a g—rdswoman from a small island near the Golden City, so she has likely never seen real combat besides separating civil—n scuffles or the occasional ocean beast. That fact would be reasoning for her to not be trusted with your ‘FAL,’ yet I feel that after yesterday’s enc—nter, she has realized the greater importance of her newf—nd position as a guardswoman within the mainland. A mere ten abhorrent were en—gh to crush her resolve, yet that was sufficient to reveal her true conviction: her wish to protect. Furthermore, she is will—g to submit herself to learning once more, despite already having been tr—ned as a guardswoman, and I have alr—dy begun preparing her in earnest.”*

The large maroon Malkrin returned her focus to the engineer, crossing her arms over her chest. *“Again, do not take my words wholly, d—rest Harrison. I do not ask for you to bless any irrespon—ble fool with your holy creations. I only ask that you obs—ve her dedication for yourself and then finalize your decis—n.”*

He scrubbed his face, mulling over the paladin’s words. He didn’t *know* the guardswoman, and he didn’t exactly *trust* the guardswoman… but he had a lot of faith in Shar. “Alright. I’ll keep an eye on her for a bit and see how she acts. Maybe talk to her directly. For now, personal defense has been expanded a good bit, so we do have some leeway for splitting up and pursuing some things outside as is. I’ll have you, the guardswoman, and the lumberjack come along for the mining trip later today then. How about that?”

She nodded. *“I believe that to be a r—sonable group for an excursion. We shall be well-armed and equipped for the task while leav—g Cera, Akula, and the craftsman to defend our home.”*

Home, huh…

His vision returned to the dozen Malkrin working around the modules, a small part of him lightening up at the sight. “We should probably get started on that soon, though. I’ll grab those two and let ‘em have a short break ‘till we set off. Before you get ready, could you bring the mining equipment case up to the front of the workshop? We’ll get situated there.”

*“It sh—l be done.”*

With that, they parted ways. He cleaned up the range, recycled their extra brass and put the FAL away, then approached the small group of Malkrin at the bottom of the hill. A few were chopping wood directly, while others worked to clear and stack the harvested trees in a simplistic factory line. He smirked at the more efficient effort. The ceramist must have taken some of his advice in organizing the others. Cera spotted him and gave him a small wave, stopping her progress in hacking down a rather thick log, and the others followed suit, each curiously awaiting him. The orange-skinned lumberjack in the group still held her axe in place, ready to start another swing with an expectation of returning to her task immediately.

One of the fisherwoman twins bowed her head toward him, speaking with casual respect, her vaguely Slavic accent showing. *“Greetings, Creator. What is it you require?”*

He raised a palm. “I need the lumberjack and the guardswoman to accompany me on an excursion.” His eyes settled on the mentioned females. “You’re free to decline, but I’d appreciate your help.”

The orange-colored Malkrin nodded slowly and put away her axe on her back-mounted sheath, making her way toward the engineer. The guardswoman stood still, her gaze flickering between the others and Harrison. Her fists clenched briefly before she fell in line with the other.

*“If you require my assistance, I shall not deny it, high Creator,”* the yellow-skinned female stated. *“When shall we depart?”*

The human gestured towards the fireplace. “In a little bit. Rest up a bit beforehand and get something to eat; we might be out for a while. And for the rest of you,” he addressed the group at large. “You’ve done fine work keeping our wood stocked. Finish up clearing this last tree and then talk to Akula about dinner. I think she and the chef are preparing something extra for tonight.”

Cera gave him a thumbs up, just as Tracy taught her. Some responses of ‘of course’ and ‘it shall be done’ followed as the others got to work. The two that were going to be joining the engineer followed him back to the workshop entrance, where Shar was waiting by the array of spikes with a large gray case containing the mining equipment, two sharpened pickaxes preemptively attached to its side.

“Lumberjack,” Harrison addressed the female beside him. “Would you mind taking that case off of Shar?”

Her voice was deep, much more so than the others. She almost growled as she responded tersely in the affirmative. *“I do not mind, no.”*

“There are straps on it, so you can put it on your back if you want. I wouldn’t recommend it until we set off, though. It’s hefty”

The harvester took the heavy container and held it with minimal difficulty, bowing her head toward Harrison with a dead stare. *“Thank you”*

Thank you...? Alright then. He was a bit hesitant to let the female take such precious cargo initially, but after recalling how Sharky always had to adjust herself over the weight of her armor, shield, equipment, and now heavy machine gun, he figured she didn’t need anything else packed onto her back. The mining equipment was burdensome too. The apparatus itself was, sure, but the sheer amount of high-density polymer used to protect it was even worse; the machine wasn’t something he wanted to damage in the slightest…

“Don’t mention it.” He waved the Malkrin off. “You three go take a rest by the fire. I’ll finish up some things before we set out.”

The lumberjack and guardswoman offered a few short words of appreciation while Shar did that serious three-armed salute thing across her chest. What got her all worked up? He could have sworn she was just starting to become more casual around him. Maybe it was because it was in front of others? Odd.

He entered the workshop and met up with the ever-busy Tracy. She’d already finished the submersible and was putting some final touches on the cave exploration drone. The excursion would serve as the initial testing of her latest project. Additionally, they discussed the mining operation prior, so the technician was prepared to allocate two reconnaissance flyers to follow him, while she looked out for the Malkrin staying back at camp.

The two of them discussed future plans for a little while, bringing up how to implement small automated processes to make things like drone fabrication or material transfer faster. Tracy wanted to create robotic mules to save the manpower of having to bring back wood, metal, and aquatic resources, and Harrison had to agree. Though, as luck would have it, there weren’t any easy blueprints in the workshop’s library for those. He asked Sebas about it, to which he responded with ‘Automatons can be fabricated and directed by the vehicle bay. Please connect the vehicle bay module to the local network for further specifications.’ 

It annoyingly made sense. Common fabricators couldn’t print out bigger robots in their entirety. They needed to be assembled by machines much larger in magnitude. So, even if Tracy had the designs, she’d have to weld and assemble the individual pieces together anyway. The reminder of the other ship parts did serve to spark further discussion on future plans, however. The vehicle bay wasn’t too far out—being under a two-day trip—and from what his datapad said, it wasn’t badly damaged either. He wasn’t sure if he’d even try to fly it back, but he could at least download the blueprints and attempt to bring one of the assumed-to-be-still-intact rovers back for transportation.

That was probably going to be a trip for after the blood-moon, though. He needed to focus on the here and now. There was metal to harvest and not a lot of sun left in the day to do it, and the Malkrin were probably well-rested enough after his and Tracy’s thirty-minute conversation.

He put his armor and helmet on, sliding his newly acquired Geiger counter into an open slot on his chest rig. The technician gave him a worried look, almost appearing to ask ‘You’re really going out?’ She never spoke up about it when he waved her goodbye, only returning with her unique fare well.

“Don’t go fucking with any anomalies while you’re out there. I can’t run a colony all by myself, dude.”

He nodded solemnly, understanding exactly what she meant underneath the thin veil of comedy she put over her warning, then dipped out of the workshop with the cave exploration drone in hand. The sun wasn’t setting yet, thankfully; It hung low above the ocean, casting plenty of horizontal shadows within the settlement and forest. Best not to waste the time he had. The engineer approached the fireplace, enjoying its hearty scent alongside the smoked fish the Malkrin were eating. The wood-collecting group had finished their job, taking a well-deserved rest alongside those who were about to set out. Their intent leaked as they conversed about the day’s work, Shar’s weapon, and each other, some of which evidently harbored inside jokes, based on the laughing with that amusing chittering noise they made. 

Some part of him felt a little bad for interrupting, but not *too* bad. He wasn’t going to wait for them to get bored before setting out, so he cleared his throat and approached the group, walking up beside the paladin. They were all sitting on their own seats, but even then, they were still taller than him, somehow making him feel even shorter than when they stood up normally. They quickly noticed his presence and grew quiet, putting their forks and knives down.

“We’re heading out. There’s not much time before sundown, so get ready,” he addressed the Malkrin, three of them standing up and putting on their respective backpacks—the lumberjack with the mining equipment, the guardswoman with Shar’s old spear pack, and the paladin with her shield and M2. Each had their own personal rig by then, their pockets already filled with tools. They were well-equipped, but not exactly well-trained… yet. They’d become accustomed to their instruments soon. Plus, this excursion would be a good opportunity to give them further experience.

The maroon-colored female detached the heavy machine gun from her backpack, holding onto the hand grips with two arms while her other pair slotted an ammo can into place, dropping the cover latch in place and cycling a round into the chamber. She nailed down everything he told her about using the weapon; the way each piece clicked and slid into place was damn satisfying. The firearm really did fit her, especially size-wise. The FAL appeared small in the hands of a female Malkrin, but the massive M2 suited the giant paladin. Add on the fact that she could use it *with* a shield… He might not even need to participate in the next blood-moon. Somehow, he was able to make a monster into something even more intimidating, and he was proud of his creation.

The other two followed suit, falling in line with Harrison as they set out. They initially had some semblance of a formation with Shar in front and the Guardswoman in the back of a line, but that quickly gave way as the paladin realized she was supposed to be teaching the yellow-colored female.

His protector did just that, explaining stances, something about mindsets, and of course, the spider-crabs and all their terrifying cousins. She took many examples from her various encounters, even regaling some tales of how she survived before Harrison arrived. Then, she went into more detail about some of the most recent attacks, noting how the ‘abhorrent’ acted and reacted, emphasizing Harrison’s defense doctrine. Shar also couldn’t help herself from putting the engineer on a pedestal, bringing up his part in the fighting. That garnered a good few looks from the guardswoman as she stared at his shotgun.

The cave was less than a kilometer out, so the walking conversation didn’t last. They were at its entrance before long, the decaying husks of the colossi curiously missing. Their disappearance caused goosebumps to flicker along his neck, but he quickly pushed the notion away, figuring the millipede things got to them first. There had to be an extensive amount of decomposers in the ecosystem though…

That didn’t matter. There was still plenty of metal to be acquired, and the sun’s rays were already being cut to pieces by the trees. He flicked his helmet light on, pressing the others to do the same with their hand-held—or in Shar’s case, shoulder and gun-mounted—counterparts. The small group pushed into the darkness, short reflections of the minerals inside causing a minute dazzling effect. It was cold inside, which was only exacerbated by a small wind from further inside the tunnel. Weren’t caves meant to be warmer? At least the exercise he was about to get would balance it out, but he hoped the Malkrin wouldn’t be too affected.

He pulled out a UV light and walked up to one of the walls, letting its purple aura shine over the material embedded within. The ore quickly fluoresced with a yellow-orange tint, confirming Sebas’ theory—it was sphalerite. The Malkrin perked up at the sight, all of them wearing fascinated expressions at the glowing luminescence, but they kept themselves from interrupting his tasks.

He set the dog-sized cave exploration drone down on the ground. It had six large and rugged–looking wheels that surrounded a brick-styled battery, and an extended suite of sensors that poked out above it. A few buttons were pressed, and a final switch was activated, setting the small machine on its way down the dark corridor. Task two: completed. He switched his attention to the small gathering of massive females watching over him.

“Lumberjack, could you put the case on the ground?” Harrison quietly ordered.

She did as asked, slipping the receptacle off her back as asked, while the two acting guards realized they weren’t exactly doing their job and took up their positions by the front of the cave. The engineer cautiously looked down at the end of the tunnel before taking a knee by the crate, sliding the additional pickaxes out of the way to focus his flashlight on the side latches. He pulled them open with a little effort, swinging the container open to reveal the two intact machines within. Each of the technical tools were about two-thirds of a meter long, shaped like a plasma rifle with a batch of wires around its side, and connected to their respective battery packs—all pretty standard for mining lasers. He slid the first one out of its slot, latching the charging section to his rig and powering it on. Its dull hum softly reverberated in the cave.

The orange-skinned female stepped back, taking on a cautious tone. *“Creator… What is this device of yours?”*

He held the item up for the harvester to observe. “It’s a machine that takes a lot of the manual labor out of mining by doing it for you… sorta.”

She leaned in further, taking in the sleek black and gray sheen of the tool. *“They were not speaking falsehoods about your creations… I presume we will be harvesting the material around us?”*

“Yup.” He took on a graver tone. “That’s why I’m going to need you to listen up.”

The lumberjack froze attentively, staring at him intently.

“I’m going to have you use the other one. But, you must understand, these are able to cut metal and stone, *meaning* they’re just as capable of cutting your arms clean off if not properly used. First things first.” He pointed toward the focused end of the laser’s ‘barrel.’ “You must **never** point this end at yourself or anyone else. Second thing. I’m going to show you how to calibrate the machine. Make sure you remember *everything* I say, because we’re going to return here several times for the metal deposits. Plus, you’ll most likely be teaching someone else how to use it in the future. Got that?”

She nodded, warily staring at the device in his hands.

“Now, lemme give you a quick rundown on how you’ll be using this thing.”

He went through the basics of the laser, showing her how to turn it on, how to check its charge, and the rest of its basic functions. Then, he showed her how to calibrate its refractability by doing so himself, putting its sensor up to several spots of the metal and letting the computer do the work. That part was probably the most important. The beam from the tool was easily reflected due to the basic properties of metal—especially elements like copper or silver—so if the laser wasn’t properly gauged, it was likely to bounce right off into something else. Likely the user.

He wasn’t exactly an expert in the subject. Sure, he knew his basic wave physics, but the rest was beyond him. Thankfully, the device took out much of the difficulty in planning around the refraction issue.

So, the lumberjack and he started the evening off by lopping whole chunks of sphalerite right off the wall. He never even needed to use the pickaxes he brought in case of emergency, meaning they would end up as ripe recycling material. The paladin took the time to teach the guardswoman all the while, frequently tying Harrison into her tutoring while the group stacked ore atop the transportation sleds.

Things were progressing fast as the sun dipped beneath the ground. They briefly shared a meal under the bright glow of their flashlights, talking about some plans and small observations before returning to work. The guards eventually took turns assisting with the process in what ways they could, leaving the other to defend the entrance. In the end, they must have taken over a metric ton of iron, zinc, sulfur, and a slew of trace materials off the walls of the caves by the end of their excursion, painstakingly bringing the entirety of it back on four sleds.

It was well worth it. This singular trip was about to slingshot their settlement right into the heart of automation.

Fuck JB-HIFI,thetron,1cobkx1,2024-05-09 19:43:18,178,0.89,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/thetron/comments/1cobkx1/fuck_jbhifi/,Single-Letter-5024,,"Worked there for a couple of months, it was the worst job I’ve ever had in my life. 

On my very first day, a manager who was supposed to introduce me to fellow staff members instead sat me down and went through a list of all the employees and complained about every single one of them. “This person is shit at their job, this person smells like shit, this person never listens”. It was my first day.

My second day, a coworker started playing that dumb hentai song and talked about how it was “so him”. It made me super uncomfortable cause I didn’t even know this guy and he was openly sharing his masturbation habits. 

Several other instances happened with hentai guy, where he was a misogynistic creep. He’d make weird as fuck comments to me and my underage coworkers, and say shit like certain coworkers only got sales because they had boobs. 

Eventually, when I worked counter I had a lady scream at me (as normal in retail). It was a bad day for me, so I started crying and went out the back to calm down. I got scolded by the head manager for not being able to handle it and asked when I was going to get back to work. 

I initially felt really upset but didn’t say anything, until I told some other coworkers what happened and they told me about similar and worse experiences they had with this manager, including him making unwanted sexual comments. Including him talking about the amount of sex he’d had with his partner on holiday and another MANAGER telling me he used to smack girls asses in the workplace. 

I thought this was terrible, so with these girls permission I contacted HR (however they wanted to remain anonymous). I had to ask the manager I was REPORTING for HRs number because he didn’t have it hanging up out the back (even though it said in our starting pamphlets that this was a necessity for the company). 

I told HR about this manager and they told me that possibly a member of HR would come to the workplace to personally speak with all the girls. This never happened, of course. 

I decided to go to a different manager about the “hentai” coworker, after I had gathered enough courage. I also decided to report multiple misogynistic comments he’d made at the same time. 

The following are pieces of the email I sent to HR about what happened in that meeting, since it was so fucking terrible that I couldn’t even explain it from the top. I’ve censored the names for the safety of the girls involved. 

About two weeks into us setting up the Te Awa store, myself and coworker [UNDERAGE COWORKER] were sitting in the food court on a lunch break, which all coworkers took at the same time because we weren’t open to the public. [HENTAI GUY] came to sit with us, and started pointing to girls in the food court and asking “how old do you think she is?” [UNDERAGE COWORKER] answered “probably 17 or 18 I guess” and [HENTAI GUY] began to complain about not knowing girls ages, and being afraid of finding them attractive when they might be children. I pointed out that he had a girlfriend, so he wouldn’t be acting upon any crushes he had on passing girls, and that if he somehow did find out one he thought was cute was a child, he just wouldn’t be attracted to them anymore. He proceeded to try and continue the conversation by complaining some more about his possible attraction to younger girls, and [UNDERAGE COWORKER] and I both felt uncomfortable and weirded out by this topic choice that was bought up unprompted. Eventually, [UNDERAGE COWORKER] and I began to ignore him and talk about our own topic and he stopped. 

HENTAI GUY was strangely protective of what music was played in the backroom, when I asked to queue a song he adamantly refused but when a male coworker asked to play music he promptly allowed him to queue one. I ended up queuing a song that I hoped he’d like (I didn’t know him very well yet) as it was similar to one’s he had already been playing, and when it came on I asked if he liked it. He started talking about how it was so “basic” and continued to be pretty elitist about his music tastes, before complaining about it being too “woman”.

when we were setting up the new store we were able to hook music up to the speaker system, as only the merch team and the builders would be in the store. We were playing popular music from a playlist on a coworkers phone, one that was generic as to allow most everyone to enjoy it. [HENTAI GUY] walked past with [MALE COWORKER], complaining about [FEMALE COWORKER] music being too “teenage girl” and talking about how his taste was superior. The way he talked and talks about women left me and my coworkers often feeling uncomfortable, as he has a habit to bring gender into the discussion when it is not relevant.  

There are more examples, but this post is already so long. 

When I bought up the (how I saw it) misogynistic comments, I was very quickly shut down by [MANAGER], him saying “I don’t think that’s misogynistic” even when I had tried to express that I didn’t think it was INTENTIONALLY misogynistic, it just made me feel as if he had a bias. [MANAGER] then said “it’s probably an OUTDATED way of thinking, but not misogyny”. I felt immediately shut down, as I hadn’t even started and was already shamed for trying to bring up a concern. From there, I explained the two problems of my own that I had faced with [HENTAI GUY], and [MANAGER] started to ask me what could have possibly happened more recently to prompt me into coming to him. I told him that there HADNT been any more recent events, but I had only just now built up the courage to come to him about what had happened. He then started to berate me about not coming to him earlier, as it’s harder to investigate when “it was months ago”. He seemed to insinuate that if I thought it was so serious, I should’ve come to him sooner. 

I tried to remind him of how difficult it was to find the courage to come forward and he said “I understand, but this still makes it far more difficult for me when this could’ve happened forever ago” (it had happened a month before)

When I told him I also wanted to bring up two stories that bought me concern from two of my close coworkers, he told me that he thought I should be “careful i wasn’t going on a witch hunt” and continued to lecture me about how trying to receive support from other women in my workplace was actually a witch hunt for something that “isn’t actually a big issue) 

He said I shouldn’t go around asking what other female workers felt, that I could create a “witch hunt” that could spiral. I told him I didn’t intend to do that, that I just wanted to tell him what TWO other girls had told me because I was concerned by it, and he said that he couldn’t take them seriously because the girls weren’t coming to him themselves. I said that I understood if he didn’t want to take them at more than face value, but I was only trying to look out for my coworkers who were too afraid to come forward. I told him their stories, and I then started expressing my concern with a general lack of empathy in the work place, that I personally felt that the girls in the workplace didn’t feel comfortable coming forward because they felt as though they wouldn’t be listened to. 

[FEMALE COWORKER], the admin who was also in the office while this talk was taking place, decided to interject, and promptly began raising her tone at me, telling me that I was being very rude by saying that I felt there was no empathy, scolding me for it, telling me how “I stay here and listen to girls half the day” (untrue) and “we used to do ‘how do you feel Wednesdays’ before you started working here so you don’t even know what we try to do” and when I said I was concerned that there was no number for HR up out the back, she continued to aggressively tell me off for being rude, telling me that she was still trying to sort out everything that needed to go on the cork board, and that the number was available through backstage (which I didn’t have access to yet) and that that should’ve been good enough. She then told me that overall my concerns were “not on”. Throughout this, she told me that I had “no idea what they do” and “how much work goes into this” and was shamed for bringing up any concerns. 

Alongside this, previously in the conversation [MANAGER] had told me I could contact [ADMIN] if I didn’t feel comfortable going to him. I informed him of how I DID, initially, message [ADMIN] when a coworker suggested I do so and gave me her number. I didn’t realise the protocol about reaching out, and did so around 10pm at night over text, hoping [ADMIN] might see it in the morning. It wasn’t my intention to disturb her, but she made very clear through multiple sarcastic comments after I told [MANAGER] that I HAD tried to contact her, that I had disturbed her. I did apologise profusely to her two weeks ago when she initially texted back telling me she was on leave, but clearly she was still pretty angry about it since she made multiple comments about how I should’ve known better, and it’s clearly not her work hours and she shouldn’t have to “deal with drama” when it’s outside of them. I understand this, but felt it was disrespectful and cruel to continue to berate me for it, and quite clearly hold a grudge against me for an honest mistake that I had already apologised for multiple times. She was needlessly rude and aggressive towards me for this. 

I started crying eventually. [MANAGER] proceeded to try and say that he CANT bring empathy into this, because it won’t work, because he needs to be logical about what steps to take in these situations. He told me he cannot have empathy and logic in situations like what I’ve bought up as they’re too serious of accusations to have empathy involved. I sincerely couldn’t breathe or pull myself together for probably going on ten minutes, ten minutes where I tried not to hyperventilate in front of both [ADMIN] and [MANAGER]. During this time, [MANAGER] continued to say more about how he can’t bring empathy into this.

I just barely was able to ask to be allowed to go home early, still hyperventilating and [MANAGER] asked if I could “just hold on to the end of the day” because he believed that sending me home was an “easy out” but he wanted me to “persevere”. I insisted on going home, still barely able to talk because of the hyperventilating, and he said if I really had to.

In retrospect, I personally felt the discussion with [MANAGER] was incredibly manipulative. I felt as though I was shamed for speaking up, not just for myself but on behalf of my coworkers. I also felt as though I was not taken seriously, as [ADMIN] was present in the office while I shared these concerns and at the start of the discussion, I was told [ADMIN] was non judgemental and was just there to do her work while we chatted, but instead she intervened with multiple sarcastic comments that I found disrespectful to the nature of the discussion we were having as well as needlessly aggressive and defensive when I shared my concerns. 

I personally felt the way the situation was handled was intentional, as it puts in light for me many of the reasons why the girls in the store don’t feel comfortable speaking up. I was appalled by the way this entire situation was handled by [MANAGER] and [ADMIN], as I didn’t intend to intentionally offend anyone, only share my concerns with someone who’s job it was supposed to be to listen to me before I found it necessary to go to HR. I felt I was taken advantage of when I was unable to defend myself as I was already terrified coming forward with these stories, and felt as though I was manipulated into believing it was my fault for making it a big deal, rather than the big deal it needed to be treated as. 

Here are the accounts from two other female coworkers, which as they are second hand from me, maybe be taken at face value. I still felt personally concerned by them and also felt as though they weren’t out of character for [HENTAI GUYS] behaviour. 

First account: 
Underage Coworker said “pog”and [HENTAI GUY] recounted a story of when he had said “pog” after ejaculation during intercourse with his girlfriend. Coworker who this happened to was 17 at the time, and had only first started working at JBHIFI. the event took place around midday at the Barton street store. 

Second account:
[FEMALE COWORKER1] is a very talented salesperson, and very good at her job. This account took place at the Barton street store, around the afternoon to evening, several months to nearly a year ago. [HENTAI GUY] expressed to [female coworker2] that [FEMALE COWORKER1) was only good at sales because she “had her boobs out all the time” and continued to mock her, pointing out the way she was standing and saying “look, she’s doing it now!”. When coworker expressed discomfort and this, [HENTAI GUY] later expressed “don’t tell [female coworker2] about that, she can’t take a joke”. 

After I went to HR with my concerns HENTAI GUY was spoken to. After this, however, he would make “jokes” around me about “appropriate workplace discussion” (the topic he was talked to about). 

There were many problems in the workplace, including the way everyone would be mean about each other but claim to be friends. Managers I talked to would say [X] worker is useless, unhelpful, etc. and then also put an arm around the same worker later on to show camaraderie. 

I didn’t initially intend to come public about my experience, however I heard after I left that management continued to push the “witch hunt” rhetoric they tried to use to manipulate me into silence when talking to my old coworkers about the why I left and I’ve decided it was time to share. 

I eventually left, the last straw being a simple meeting with a manager where I was scolded for “having an attitude” when I asked “what do you want me to prioritise?” (Verbatim). I note that this manager participated with [HENTAI GUY] in the “appropriate workplace discussion” jokes after my talk with HR. I personally felt this manager had it out for me for reporting their friend. 

All in all, fuck jbhifi. Worst job I’ve ever had, with only a small minority of coworkers being kind and supportive people. Also, most people there are super unhelpful anyways. I was doing like 4 different jobs because none of their staff wanted to cover security guards on their breaks. Fuck jbhifi 

EDIT: thank you all so much for the overwhelming support on this post, and thank you to the previous coworkers/workers that I didn’t personally work with who messaged me to corroborate what I went through and what they went through too. I’m so glad this post could be validating to some of you who went through all the BS and had no one to turn to since management didn’t want to do anything about it. Thank you as well to the moderators for being so onto it!! You guys are awesome. Love to you all <3 "
Help needed to optimize supplement approach with regard to my genetic profile (a lot of info included!),MTHFR,1clroi3,2024-05-06 15:25:26,7,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1clroi3/help_needed_to_optimize_supplement_approach_with/,Crazy-Sir5935,Question,"Key question for my fellow Reddit users (in hope Tawinn reads my post):

1. What are your thoughts on my ""6 Changes to my supplement approach/plan""? Would this be the way to go? Did i overlook something?
2. In his book ""Dirty Genes"" Ben lynch calls the ""Choline shortcut"" a temporary solution on which one can't rely permanently. He says that in contrast your primary methylation cycle supports all organs and tissues including your brain (while the choline shortcut would only be there to protect the liver and kidneys). This is kind of confusing to me as on this forum and Chris Masterjohn don't seem to see this as a temporary fix?

6. Changes to my suppplement approach/plan taking into account my mthfr/gene profile

**1.SYMPTOMS**

My background (38Y/male):

* Experienced a lot of traumatic life events especially during childhood.
* Got diagnosed ADD (inattentive form of ADHD) and get presribed ritalin since 15 years.
* Experienced a lot of stress and had a partial burnout a couple of years ago.

Since the summer of 2022 (after having corona) i started having weird symptoms like:

* Brain fog (literally asking the same question within 30 min, not remembering names and even the names of my wife's friends and neighbors, sometimes it felt like a little door was locked and after 3 minutes i could finally call their names). The brain fog does seem to be like 50% less than a year ago tough.
* Raynauld’s disease
* Chilblains and feet (extreme, even getting cuts in my hands, even during summer months). My fingers typically become like a bit swollen red.
* Problems tolerating temperature changes (I even got red finger tips in summer and have trouble tolerating hot weather as well).
* Tinnitus
* Anxiety, depression, and mood swings
* Concentration issues (my mind is like a pinball machine)
* Motivation problems (procrastination etc.)
* Seborrheic eczema (got shampoo from the doc)
* Insomnia (although i can manage it somehow by focusing not to think about anything)
* Going to the toilet multiple times at night (feel like I’m 80 instead of 38)
* Fatigue all day
* Hair loss, basically lost more in the last 3 years than the prior 10. I also got my first grey hairs in my beard.
* Had 2 low grade dental infections of which 1 is already treated in March (by extraction) and 1 is going to be treated tomorrow, had the both of them for a minimum of 3 years.

No patience with the kids (i hate this), I feel so exhausted that around 10 every morning my energytank for the day is kind of depleted. As I work behind a computer the energy issues is not really needed for work but I hate it in family life (I just want to be able to play ball with my kids).  

*\~Personal most important symptoms I wish to tackle (if I was a magician):\~* *ADD(motivation/concentration) + Fatigue all day*

[**4.FAMILY**](http://4.FAMILY) **CONDITIONS (might be related):**

Both blood lines have/had vein related problems (plague in the arteries). My granddad even got severe dementia from it.

One blood line (mothers side) has also severe mental problems (bipolar/ADD/depression) in multiple/every generation, my great grandfather committed suicide.

**5.WHOLE BACKGROUND STORY:**

I became extremely worried since September 2022. Before that time i had been fighting motivation, procastination and concentration issues all my life (as a typical ADD guy) I was thinking about really bad conditions like a brain tumor, Multiple Sclerosis etc. I got my blood checked and even got brain and neck scanned with an MRI and everything seemed to be fine except for T2 flair hyperintense signal abnormalities (vein related. Still, my symptoms got worse.

Besides this i was doing a neurofeedback course under supervision of a neuropsychologist. He did a EEG in June of 2022 and also did one in the beginning of may 2023. After reading the results of the EEG from may he was shocked, my EEG levels were way worse than they were a year before. He asked me if i was depressed or had an underlying condition. He said i needed to be checked for systematic conditions.

In February of 2023 i went to a Wim Hof workshop (cold bath) and somebody there talked about water fasting that would trigger autogaphy. Being as desperate as i was/am after the last EEG results i decided to do a 7 day water fast in may (having two children of 2 and 4 this is not something you'll decide overnight).

After the water fast i felt tired but in a way ""in control"". My ritalin usage was reduced in a year from 35 mg a day to 12,5mg a day but that might be due to placebo as well. As i was reading the book ""Super Gut"" (by Dr. William Davis) i decided to try some herbal antibiotics for SIBO/SIFO, following his prescribed protocol of taking Antibactin-AR and Antibactin-BR twice a day. Besides that i was eating a very strict diet focusing on low glycemic index foods, no gluten and no lactose (as I was suffering from bloating as well and in the end dysbiosis was confirmed by a functional doctor).

Within a couple of days my mind felt much more clear, i could concentrate and the brain fog almost disappeared. From then on i went tot about 7,5mg a day of ritalin (practically nothing). I even cancelled my appointment with a neurologist as i was so confident that it had nothing to do with my brain anymore but rather with my belly!

But time seemed to catch up with me. I was basically eating a low carb diet and eating less just seemed to improve my symptoms. I went into a clinical path of finding out if I had coeliac disease (they did a endoscopy). For that i had to eat gluten again for about 5 months and that raised my ritalin again to about 25mg/day but I found out I haven’t got coeliac disease (more non-celiac gluten sensitivity based on a stool test of my functional doc).

In December 2023 I decided to do a full range stool analysis via my functional doc (at a lab in Germany) and the results basically stated I had slight form of dysbiosis, problems with fat absorption, relatively low stomach acid and a relatively high TMAO (that’s the summary). I’ve been on a diet not eating any gluten/lactose since January and have had pre- and probiotics with it. I feel I can’t eat healthier than this and even feel somewhat down sometimes as my “extravert”  side kind of left since not eating any sugars (I do watch my calorie intake to be enough).

Over the past years I’ve read about 12 books that focus on the microbiome and how to fix it but somehow I keep being sensitive to fatty foods and I don’t seem to fully be able to fix my gut. Based on that (and the book Dirty Genes of Ben Lynch) I kind of wandered off into the realm of genes (as looking more to other factors contributing to my gut/mental issues). I did a whole genome sequence in November 2023 and just got the results in. Believe it or not, this is basically 10% of the story, there's a lot more to it in that i could probably write a book about it but i don't want to be a burden on anyone's time here. I really hope there's somebody here that has a clue what's going on (i've heared mast cell activation syndrome might be it).

**6.CHANGES TO MY SUPPLEMENT APPROACH/PLAN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT MY MTHFR/GENE PROFILE:**

All based on the post and recommendations made in this post:

[MTHFR: A Supplement Stack Approach : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/)

[MTHFR, COMT and MAO-A: A Symptom Triumvirate : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1aocoqb/mthfr_comt_and_maoa_a_symptom_triumvirate/)

**Phase 1 –** **B12**

Not B12 deficiency, might switch to hydroxocobalamin instead of methylcobalamin.

**Phase 2 – B2**

Target = B2 10-100mg/day,

Current = B2 (riboflavin-5-phosphate) 3.6 mg,

Action = Take >6,4 mg extra of B2.

**Phase 3 – Methyl-Buffering System**

Target = Glycine 3-10g/day

Current = 450mg/day

Action = Tale >2,5g extra of Glycine

Iron/Vitamin A I get via the multisupplement

**Phase 4 –** **Reduce creatine demand on methylation**

Target = 3-5g/day

Current = 3,5g/day (since 1 week)

Action = None (might focus on glycine as I do have to pee multiple times a night)

**Phase 5 –** **Support alternate methylation pathway and reduce phosphatidylcholine demand on methylation**

Target = 1000-1200mg/day (need 8 eggs a day via the Choline calculator)

Current = 120mg/day (via multisupplement)

Action =

50% via TMG and thus 600mg/day (powder/capsules)

Phosphatidyl Choline 2g/day

CDP Choline 1,5g/day

*I prefer choline versions that don’t have a risk/lowest risk in increasing TMAO because of my high TMAO and genetic disposition to have artery plague/problems.*

**Phase 6 –** **Folate intake**

It’s in my multivitamin supplement but not necessary, I guess.

 Thank you for reading this long post.

Shogun MBTI (2024 TV show — SPOILERS!),mbti,1ch55bi,2024-04-30 17:59:33,8,0.91,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/1ch55bi/shogun_mbti_2024_tv_show_spoilers/,luminouschela,Celebrity/Character,"**\*\*SPOILER WARNING AGAIN\*\* I mention little moments that occurred at various points throughout the season.**

Not sure if any MBTI enthusiasts also liked the recent Shogun TV show, so I’m not sure if this post will generate much activity, but here are my thoughts.

I loved the series and wanted to explore some of the characters’ types. Of note, I haven’t read the books, so these assessments are based only on the TV show.

*I'm sure there are grammatical and spelling errors, please ignore them!*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**YOSHII TORANAGA - INTJ**

***Introverted intuition:*** Envisioning an outcome far off in the distance and feeling very dedicated to that vision. Not multiple options of what could be/what he’s hoping for but one thing—Shogun. His vision of himself in power, as Shogun, and of a peaceful Japan. His far-reaching plan to become Shogun (seems it may have been started all the way back when Akechi Jinsai killed the Taiko? Unclear to me if Toranaga pushed him to do it or not). Able to get a sense of the nature of others (this is how he can then apply Te so effectively to use the people around him to serve his Ni goal). His observant nature, his studying of the wind. They did an excellent job of having so many shots where Toranaga is just watching everything and everyone around him (understanding how he could use Yabushige and his playing of both sides; him saying to Mariko and John there’s a shadow over them, and him questioning Markio about what’s between them). His ability to understand Hiromatsu’s plan—without them needing to talk about it, he can understand how Hiromatsu’s death would benefit his plan to seem defeated. The way the different types of hawks symbolize John, Yabushige, and Mariko to him. Of course, he’s human and can’t anticipate everything—he understood his son but underestimated how reckless Nagakado was; I think he may have been surprised by his brother’s betrayal—but I think they did a good job of showing this as a strength of his.

***Extroverted thinking:*** Makes concrete plans to bring his Ni vision to life in the real world. Uses the world around him, including the people associated with him, as tools to achieve his goals (and highly values the tools/people he feels are most useful). Able to really understand, create, work within, and manipulate systems and hierarchies (for example, he utilized the weaknesses of the Council of Regents’ structure to manipulate them). He is annoyed with distractions, poor strategy, and small talk (he got increasingly frustrated by his son’s lack of insight, Buntaro fixated on Mariko and John, John fixated on his ship). Wants the most efficient strategy to win (minimize loss, cost, etc.). Feels confident leading, giving orders, etc.

***Introverted feeling:*** Hides his true intentions and feelings from most people and does so effectively. Because he’s so secretive and hard to read, few know the depths of his feelings and beliefs. He certainly has his cold and calculating side (which becomes even more apparent in the last episode). I think he also truly loved Mariko and Hiromatsu, and that all of the tears he shed for them were genuine. By the end of the last episode, his fondness for John also seemed genuine. He doesn’t show much affection toward his wife (wives? Wife and consort?), but he is respectful to them and seems to try and keep them safe (maybe a personal value of his not to be harsh to them or something). He appreciates poetry and uses it to express his feelings in a more understated way. Also, NiFi work together to help him understand people—Ni gives him data about what someone might do, Fi helps him understand why.

***Extraverted sensing:*** The endpoint is fixed, but the path to his goal is adaptable when required (he didn’t plan for Nagakado to kill those people or for the earthquake, but when those things happened, Toranaga accepted reality and adjusted his plans). Not only does he study the wind, he adapts to the way it changes. He likes to watch the falcons and appreciates their different hunting styles, especially the elegance of his primary falcon. He grew to be good with a sword (of course I’m sure any child would have a hard time being a second…). He is able to pick up diving pretty quickly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TODA MARIKO - ISTJ**

***Introverted sensing:*** Respects her culture’s customs—loyal to her leader, listens to her abusive husband and doesn’t speak ill of him in public (despite hating him), thinks it’s important for everyone to have their purpose, focused on the samurai having their swords, understands the power structures and customs well. As Ochiba says, she understands what she’s to do, where she’s to go, and what role she should play without being told. Cannot let the memories of the past go or the heavy weight of her family name, those things haunt her, her whole life and take up a significant part of her days (and it was Toranaga that interpreted her father’s actions—sending her away to save her (and also to follow Toranag?)—Mariko didn’t come to that conclusion on her own). Generally comfortable with the routine/sticking to the plan (she wants to die but otherwise she isn’t longing to break away from what the group is doing).

***Extroverted thinking***: A good strategist in her own right (negotiating the price with Gin, the way she handled the translations (didn’t always say exactly what was said), her understanding of how to play her role once she gets to Osaka and part of that is by manipulating the power structure). She understands how to use her words effectively to accomplish a goal rather than just express herself (comforting Toranaga, giving Ochiba a clue Ishido wouldn’t understand). Even in small ways she is good at making sure what needs to get done, gets done: helps Fuji give up her son; negotiates with Fuji to stay with John for 6 months (because Toranaga wants Fuji to do that, so Mariko comes up with a plan to accomplish the task), and gets John set up in his home in Ajiro (the vibe of ok everyone, here he is, he needs swords, he needs a bath, etc. making sure those practicalities are handled).

***Introverted feeling:*** Like Toranaga she hides her emotions well when she wants to—the queen of maintaining a blank face and giving off a cold vibe. Buntaro, for example, is surprised at the end that she never cared for him (when she reveals that in the tea room). She feels close to John after he steps up to second her because he’s finally honoring what she’s doing, how she feels, and what she believes instead of trying to force something else on her. The cross was so meaningful to her because of its emotional significance, and it never left her body until the scene where she thought she’d have to kill herself (this has SiFi tones as well because it’s particularly related to intense past experiences). I think she, like Toranaga, appreciates that poetry can allow for emotional expression in a more subtle way. Si and Fi can interact by Fi imbuing reflections of the past with strong emotional tones (so she doesn’t just remember her father’s betrayal, it also deeply pierces her emotionally whenever she thinks of it). She also has an emotional attachment to the customs—when Toranaga is without his swords after the earthquake, she is very distressed about it. Similar to Toranaga, her Si and Fi work together to help her understand people—Si gives her data about what someone might do (based on how they’ve acted in the past, ), Fi helps her understand why they do what they do—this is why she was better at understanding Ochiba no Kata, Mariko grew to know her and understand her motivations steadily over time.

***Extraverted intuition:*** I think this is part of what makes her good at poetry—being able to make quick connections between words and concepts, even ones that seem disparate. I think this also helps her be so adept at her translator role (understanding the essence of what’s being said by the speaker and thinking of ways to express the same sentiment/general idea while using words that are not offensive to the receiver).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**USAMI FUJI - ISFJ**

***Introverted sensing:*** Similar to Si explanation for Mariko—for example, she was so unhappy about having to be John’s consort, but once she’s committed herself to the role she does it to the fullest (when she takes John’s gun and promises to care for it while also pointing it at Omi, making sure there’s dinner and that the house is clean, making sure the gardener was killed for disobeying John and touching that bird). At the end her calling isn’t to find freedom, build a new social structure (like Gin), or try to find power—she is comfortable with and comforted by the idea of becoming a nun (something long established, something she can more confidently predict and envision).

***Extraverted feeling:*** Once she settles into her role, she is good at meeting the needs of others and trying to maintain a stable emotional atmosphere (make sure we throw the soup out far away so the smell won’t bother everyone; make sure we have the right dishes, if we don’t let me offer a quick but warm apology to smooth over any insults). Comparing Mariko and Fuji, if John says something that Mariko finds offends her own beliefs or the cultural structures in place enough, she says something to him (pushes back/argues; “your words *gave* the bird meaning”, clearly insinuating the situation he’s upset about is his own fault and expresses disapproval; vs Fuji trying to follow his logic and ultimately apologizing and offering to kill herself to stop his anger when they can’t seem to understand each other). Maybe Fuji would push back/argue on occasion, but when we see her interactions with John she just meets the needs he’s expressed or protects him in her own way (when John and Buntaro are drunk at dinner, she tries to apologize (on John’s behalf) for his bad behavior; when John asks her to arrange a meeting with Toranaga and help him with his message, she does so no questions asked). More outwardly emotionally expressive (really big reaction when her son and husband were to die (understandable of course) and when she’s told she has to be John’s consort vs Mariko's more internal distress at being sent away to marry Buntaro or preparing to kill herself or face her death when the door blew open). Mariko does have a significant external emotional expression after Buntaro physically abuses her after that tense dinner, but Fuji’s response is to match her intensity and try to calm things down to make sure the emotions in the house are what they should be (Fuji says something like “if you disturb this home, you dishonor the Anjin.”). At first, Fuji wants to die with her son and husband but by the end has let go of the idea, come to peace with what happened, and will instead become a nun and be in an environment with a clear way to behave and a relatively set and predictable emotional landscape (vs Mariko’s more long-lasting desire to die after her father died). Giving John her family swords as a clear sign of her commitment to her role and appreciating him giving her something and acknowledging what she’s doing.

***Introverted thinking:*** Less focused on the external implementation of plans, systems, etc.; less focused on strategizing; less focused on having clear goals and thinking about how to make them a reality. Instead, focuses on what makes sense to her—well, you said if the bird was touched, whoever touched it would have to die, but it was disturbing the peace in the neighborhood so it had to be removed…so the gardener removed it, and we killed him. We did exactly as you instructed, so why are you getting upset? John is horrified, but, to Fuji, it’s confusing to her why the gardener’s death doesn’t make sense to John. When John recommends she spread her loved ones’ ashes in the ocean, she sees this as reasonable (there’s no way the ashes can go to the family grave, how will I take it to the church, and John says this is honoring them and helping their spirit move on—it’s a reasonable idea).

***Extraverted intuition:*** We don’t get to see as much of this with her? If anyone noticed anything please do share!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ANJIN-SAN / JOHN BLACKTHORNE - ESFP**

***Extraverted sensing:*** Skilled pilot and finds the action associated with being on the ship exciting. Understands how the boat moves (when he’s directing the men how to row and how to prevent it from flipping, when he gets Toranaga’s ship out of the harbor, surprising even Toranaga). He also has skill with his guns and the cannons. A good in-the-moment and responsive thinker—his outburst in an early scene protects the guards from opening all of the boxes so Toranaga’s plan won’t be ruined, quick to action whenever there’s an attack and smart about how to take out opponents (like during the shinobi attack with his hand through the wall move and trying to block the door). Good awareness of his physical surroundings (gets the sense he'll be ambushed in the woods for ex). Heartily enjoys food and drink and wants external glory (or at least he thought he did—to be the first to sail to Japan and back to England, to gain respect in his home country, to have lots of money and die in a big home with his “trophies” if you will). A key part of his relationship with Mariko goes beyond words and is about when their fingers brush or of course when they sleep together. He has family back home (maybe kids? I can’t remember), and he may have feelings for them, but Mariko is right here in front of him, and it makes his feelings for her more intense that she’s with him in the present.

***Introverted feeling:*** His whole character arc is seeing the value in honoring others, being aware of and a part of a community, and looking beyond your personal goals and desires. I think he will hold Mariko in his heart forever and that her actions and beliefs will influence him. It’s important to him to speak out against religious hypocrisy.

***Extraverted thinking:*** He’s actually a good and animated leader. His style is different than Toranaga’s, but his SeTe work together to make him effective (like in the ending scene when they’re trying to pull the boat out of the water). I think this is part of what Toranaga sees in John/part of John’s use as a tool for Toranaga. In the end scene, the positions they’re standing in seem meaningful—Toranaga is alone and on high monitoring everyone else, looking ahead to the future, while John is amongst the people, having experiences with them, giving orders but also giving them energy and expressing appreciation for their hard work. Both of their roles are important and now they kind of understand each other and their respective roles. John tries to plan a way to use the Japanese people and get out of Japan. Even though he’s ultimately unsuccessful, he was trying to get his ship and get out nearly until the end. He kept trying to come at Toranaga from different angles (I have no role here let me go; fine, give me a bigger role and let me have my ship, and I’ll sail for you; I’ll return and get my men, then we’ll get back to the ship, etc.). His plans are more I’ll take this action now, another good SeTe example is when he threatened to kill himself at the end if Toranaga didn’t stop killing the villagers. It was an in-the-moment decision (it seemed so anyway) but based on a structure/strategy he’d learned (to die in protest).

***Introverted intuition:*** He comes to at least sense that Toranaga is looking beyond what everyone else is focusing on. Even if he doesn’t fully see the picture Toranaga does, he’s confident enough to tell that catholic guy, “if you think it’s over, you don’t know your opponent, and you aren’t seeing the full picture” (summarizing, not an actual quote). He comes to understand how elegant? Toranaga’s plan was (he comments that Toranaga doesn’t have to get his hands dirty or waste a bunch of soldiers; he just had to sacrifice one woman). He also has a clear vision of his future, and he clung to it until he truly had a change of heart (then that future vanished and he had to reimagine a life in Japan).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**KASHIGI YABUSHIGE - ESTP**

***Extraverted sensing:*** In-the-moment problem solver, like John. Like when he first arrived in Ajiro early in the season, he was quickly planning with Omi how they could use the ship to their advantage (of course with Toranaga’s more long-range based thinking, he had spies in Ajiro and already knew about the ship). Good physical awareness as well (when he wasn’t able to save that guy on the cliff, he knew when it was time to give up and was ready to kill himself), seems he’s a skilled fighter (at least from the little scene we see where he’s criticizing John for being unable to use a sword). For his torture/punishment, he likes the externally perceptible suffering of the person (likes to hear the screaming in real-time; vs say Mariko who is content with just internally knowing how much Buntaro suffers because she won’t give him any emotional reactions). Even when he had to commit Seppuku, he’s quick and decisive about it, and does it in his style (vs the other very symbolic versions we saw earlier in the show).

***Introverted thinking:*** Focused on an individualized plan for his survival. For him, SeTi led to his quick tactical changes (I’ll back this guy, never mind this one. Hm, things not looking so good anymore let me figure out how to get back in the other’s good graces, etc.). With TiFe, his plans often included an element of charming/getting friendly with other people (I’ll convince them I’m an asset, I’ll offer this thing to this person to try and please them). Always trying to figure out how he can make it through all of the craziness, how to play both sides, not caring so much about long-term plans, or making people follow him—he wants to live. He seemed like a genuinely curious person who wanted to understand things. He seemed to be developing some kind of internal system to rank different deaths, it was kind of like his own experiment (you could envision him keeping notes, writing the different deaths down, explaining the reasoning for the rankings). Frustrated when he doesn’t understand what’s going on/when things don’t make sense to him—why did Toranaga send you, Mariko? What’s his plan? Why would you start a winter poem when it’s spring? When is Crimson sky, and how will it work? He has a bit of a harder time than the Te users trying to effectively use his chess pieces (by the time he tries to give John to Ishido, John is pretty much irrelevant to Ishido).

***Extraverted feeling:*** Based on some comments and review podcasts and videos I saw—a lot of people really like Yabushige; he was a popular character. People didn’t necessarily respect him, but they found him charming and funny. I think his Fe was part of that charm (when talking with either Ishido or Toranaga, he had a very laidback “we’re all on the same side; calm down, calm down, you can trust me”, kind of that smooth-talker energy; his interactions with Omi were much less formal and distant than Toranaga’s interactions with his son. Yabushige made sure Omi was respectful, but there was more warmth between them). He was even pretty close with his main servant guy whereas none of Toranaga’s more lowly servants are seen having frequent semi-casual (while still respectful) interactions. Toranaga had to kill him in the end but smiled at him too—even though Yabushige couldn’t be trusted and had betrayed Toranaga in many ways, there was still some measure of fondness Toranaga had for Yabushige. He didn’t think about or understand the emotional impact of things until they happened, and then his emotions caught him off guard. He was so shocked about Mariko’s death, his role in causing her death, and his feelings about it that he has a mental breakdown at the end (seeing the fish, frantic on the ship back to Ajiro stopping his clothes off and talking about trying to escape to England). He wanted good social standing (liked it when the soldiers were cheering his name and got annoyed when they started cheering Toranaga’s name instead; wants to be close to and feel privy to the plans of the most powerful figures). His sexual preference was also interesting--he was more of an observer, watching his servant and Kiku’s enjoyment and feeding off of that was arousing for him. Kiku can quickly assess that that’s what might please him, but Yabushige himself almost seems surprised that he’s into it (less aware of his inner emotional self than an Fi user). Finally, he’s rarely alone. I know they all have servants and stuff but Toranaga or even John would have moments where they were just sitting/standing alone and reflecting. Yabushige usually had Omi or his servant or someone else close to him and would interact with them.

***Introverted intuition:*** He sees through Toranaga in the end and comes to understand the true nature of a life like his vs a life like Toranaga’s. He sees that Toranaga is power-hungry and just as vicious and focused on his own power/success/survival as much as anyone else—it’s just that Toranaga hides his intentions better. Yabushige also realizes he was one of Tornado’s chess pieces all along, that the leaders/the “great men” use the lives of those beneath them as tools to serve whatever greater purpose they want.

Having used the Sharp XE-A102 Electronic Cash Register for a good while now, I can confidently say it has been a reliable partner in my small retail space. Its compact design didn't clutter up any counter space, and the fact that it features a reliable 58 mm wide printer meant my receipts were always clear and detailed. The bright LED display made it easy to read orders, and the 8 departments capability was more than enough to manage my inventory.

The flexibility in payment options was a positive point too. With the Sharp XE-A102, I could accept payments via cash, cheque, and credit card. However, one area that did pose a minor complication was the fact that the instructions were rather small and required a magnifying glass for readability. Also, I had to work around a few manual features as they didn't quite align with our specific needs.

On the whole, this electronic cash register was easy to use, and the features it offered made it perfect for the needs of a small business. It's not as fast or silent as some of the other models I've used, but it's incredibly user-friendly and efficient in its operations. If you're a start-up retailer with simple cash register needs, the Sharp XE-A102 is definitely worth considering.

I've been using this adorable toy cash register in my home with my little ones, and I must say it has made pretend play more engaging and fruitful! The Joyin Toy Cash Register is a treasure trove of fun and education, making grocery shopping a delightful affair. Its dual language feature, English and Spanish, is such a bonus, given how diverse and multilingual our society is today.

One of my favorite features is the calculator with an LCD display. It's helping my little ones grasp numbers, calculations, and logical thinking at their own pace. Plus, the barcode scanner to scan the grocery products toys adds just the right amount of tech-savviness to their play.

The toy card reader with debit card adds realism to their shopping experience, while the ability to change the languages and volume, play the music, and speak the words of corresponding grocery graphics makes the entire playtime experience interactive and immersive.

I mean, who doesn't love the sound of a cash register ringing up sales? It's a testament to their budding financial literacy. Plus, the complete set of Grocery Products toys makes it feel like a real shopping adventure.

As a parent, I can't emphasize enough how much I appreciate the Cash Draw with Play Money. It's teaching my kids the value of money, something I wish I had learned at their age.

One small con to mention - the 3 AA batteries required to make it all work aren't included. But, given the superior quality, durability, and ease of use of this toy cash register, it's a con I'm willing to overlook.

In conclusion, the Joyin Toy Cash Register is an absolute winner in my books. It's fun, educational, and best of all, a joy to watch my little ones play with. Highly recommend!

I can't tell you how much fun I've had playing with Ben Franklin's Talking Cash Register Toy! This isn't just any old toy, it's got all the bells and whistles of a real cash register - and more.

One highlight that really stands out to me is how interactive this toy is. With its engaging voice technology, my kids (and even I) have spent hours going through fun learning activities. It's not just mindless fun; they're actually learning valuable skills like basic math, money management, and even some social skills along the way.

The design of this toy also deserves a special mention. Not only does it look like a real cash register with its working calculator and digital display, but it's made from safe and durable materials that ensure long-lasting play. Plus, it's suitable for both boys and girls which makes it perfect for shared playtime.

However, no product is perfect and there are a few downsides too. Some users have reported issues with the toy turning off after just a minute of inactivity, which can be quite frustrating. Additionally, a few others experienced problems with their toy's microphone or speaker, causing scratchy or buzzing sounds.

All things considered, Ben Franklin's Talking Cash Register Toy is an excellent choice for anyone looking for an engaging educational toy. Its interactive design offers hours of fun learning, while its realistic appearance and durable materials make it a long-lasting addition to your child's playtime routine.

I recently purchased the Victostar Toy Cash Register for use in our family playroom, and I must say, it's been a hit with the kids. This little cash register is the perfect size for our youngest ones, aged 3 and above. Made with top-notch materials, it's durable enough to withstand hours of play while staying in line with CE, ASTM, and EN71 standards.

What really sets this toy apart from others is its wide range of features. It comes equipped with a checkout scanner, fruit card reader, and credit card machine, which provides endless opportunities for imaginative play. Our kids have had a blast running their own little shops, scanning items, and charging imaginary credit card bills.

One downside to note is that this toy does require batteries, which we didn't realize until after purchase. However, we've found that it's been well worth the investment, especially considering how much our kids enjoy playing with it. Overall, if you're looking for a fun and educational addition to your child's playtime, I'd highly recommend giving the Victostar Toy Cash Register a try.

I was excited to introduce the Casdon Cash Register into our home, as it promised to provide hours of fun and educational play for my little one. As soon as we opened the box, I couldn't help but be amazed by the plethora of features it offered. The working calculator, scanner, and chip & pin functionality added an extra layer of realism that truly captivated my child.

One of the standout features of this toy Cash Register is its interactive nature. With a touch-sensitive screen and a microphone included, my child loved role-playing as a cashier, announcing each sale with enthusiasm. As they engaged with the toy, it became clear that not only were they having a blast but also developing essential social skills and hand-eye coordination.

The toy's sturdy construction and vibrant colors make it an attractive addition to any play space. However, it's worth mentioning that setting up the Casdon Cash Register requires a bit of effort, as it took me a couple of hours to assemble it. Additionally, the requirement of 3 AA batteries (not included) can be seen as a minor inconvenience.

Overall, the Casdon Cash Register has been a great investment for our family, providing endless entertainment and opportunities for learning. I wholeheartedly recommend this toy to any parent looking to bring the excitement of a supermarket to their child's playtime.

I recently had the opportunity to use the Casio TE-2400 Cash Register in my small boutique and I can attest to its convenience and efficiency. What I appreciated most was the combination of its 72-key flat keypad and a hub keypad at the side, which not only made data input incredibly easy but also reduced the chance of errors. Plus, the replaceable keypad cover was a lifesaver when it came to cleaning my workspace.

In terms of design, I loved how the sleek, dual-color housing elevated the overall image of my business. The keypad was operator-friendly and the perfectly positioned display allowed for easy reading from any angle. While I appreciated the keypad tones, it was great to have the option to deactivate them for a quieter environment.

Despite some initial challenges with the battery life, this cash register has undoubtedly made my daily operations smoother, and I would highly recommend it to other small business owners.

"Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.",shittyaskreddit,1c4ffp9,2024-04-15 02:34:40,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskreddit/comments/1c4ffp9/stately_plump_buck_mulligan_came_from_the/,StockingDummy,,"A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

—Introibo ad altare Dei.

Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!

Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.

Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.

—Back to barracks! he said sternly.

He added in a preacher’s tone:

—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.

He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.

—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?

He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.

—The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!

He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.

Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.

—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?

He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:

—Will he come? The jejune jesuit!

Ceasing, he began to shave with care.

—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.

—Yes, my love?

—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?

Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.

—God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks you’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.

He shaved warily over his chin.

—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is his guncase?

—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?

—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If he stays on here I am off.

Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.

—Scutter! he cried thickly.

He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said:

—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.

Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:

—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. You can almost taste it, can’t you?

He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.

—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa ponton. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the original. Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.

Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.

—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.

He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face.

—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you.

—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.

—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....

He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant smile curled his lips.

—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all!

He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.

Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.

Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.

—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?

—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.

Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.

—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You look damn well when you’re dressed.

—Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.

—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers.

He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.

Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.

—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General paralysis of the insane!

He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.

—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!

Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.

—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.

Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.

—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If Wilde were only alive to see you!

Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:

—It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.

Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.

—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God knows you have more spirit than any of them.

Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The cold steel pen.

—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.

Cranly’s arm. His arm.

—And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one that knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.

Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!

Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.

To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.

—Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at night.

—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m quite frank with you. What have you against me now?

They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.

—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.

—Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.

He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.

Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:

—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?

Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:

—What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?

—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.

—Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.

—You said, Stephen answered, O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead.

A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek.

—Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?

He shook his constraint from him nervously.

—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly thing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.

He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:

—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.

—Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.

—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.

Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.

—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.

He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.

A voice within the tower called loudly:

—Are you up there, Mulligan?

—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.

He turned towards Stephen and said:

—Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.

His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:

—Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding.

His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:

And no more turn aside and brood
Upon love’s bitter mystery
For Fergus rules the brazen cars.

Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.

A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.

Where now?

Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:

I am the boy
That can enjoy
Invisibility.

Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.

And no more turn aside and brood.

Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts.

In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.

Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat.

Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!

No, mother! Let me be and let me live.

—Kinch ahoy!

Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.

—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is apologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.

—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.

—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our sakes.

His head disappeared and reappeared.

—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.

—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.

—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.

—If you want it, Stephen said.

—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.

He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:

O, won’t we have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
On coronation,
Coronation day!
O, won’t we have a merry time
On coronation day!

Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?

He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.

In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.

—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?

Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.

—Have you the key? a voice asked.

—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!

He howled, without looking up from the fire:

—Kinch!

—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.

The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.

—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.

Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.

—What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.

—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the locker.

—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove milk.

Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:

—That woman is coming up with the milk.

—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.

He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:

—In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

Haines sat down to pour out the tea.

—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?

Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice:

—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I makes water I makes water.

—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.

Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:

—So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Begob, ma’am, says Mrs Cahill, God send you don’t make them in the one pot.

He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.

—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.

He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:

—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?

—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.

—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?

—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.

Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.

—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!

Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:

—For old Mary Ann
She doesn’t care a damn.
But, hising up her petticoats...

He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.

The doorway was darkened by an entering form.

—The milk, sir!

—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.

An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.

—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.

—To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!

Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.

—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.

—How much, sir? asked the old woman.

—A quart, Stephen said.

He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.

—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.

—Taste it, sir, she said.

He drank at her bidding.

—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.

—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.

—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.

—Look at that now, she said.

Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.

—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.

—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.

Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.

—Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?

—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir?

—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.

—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.

—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.

—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?

—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.

Haines said to her:

—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?

Stephen filled again the three cups.

—Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.

Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.

—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.

Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:

—A miracle!

He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:

—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.

Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.

—We’ll owe twopence, he said.

—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir.

She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:

—Heart of my heart, were it more,
More would be laid at your feet.

He turned to Stephen and said:

—Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.

—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.

—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.

He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:

—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?

Then he said to Haines:

—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.

—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.

Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:

—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.

Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit. Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.

—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.

Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:

—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.

—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.

—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.

Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:

—I don’t know, I’m sure.

He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:

—You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?

—Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.

—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.

—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.

Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.

—From me, Kinch, he said.

In a suddenly changed tone he added:

—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let us get out of the kip.

He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:

—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.

He emptied his pockets on to the table.

—There’s your snotrag, he said.

And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.

—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.

Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the doorway:

—Are you coming, you fellows?

—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:

—And going forth he met Butterly.

Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.

At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:

—Did you bring the key?

—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.

He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.

—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!

Haines asked:

—Do you pay rent for this tower?

—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.

—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.

They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:

—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?

—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea. But ours is the omphalos.

—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.

—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have a few pints in me first.

He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:

—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?

—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.

—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?

—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.

—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?

Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:

—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!

—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is rather long to tell.

Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.

—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.

—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles o’er his base into the sea, isn’t it?

Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.

—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.

Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.

—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.

Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:

—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
So here’s to disciples and Calvary.

He held up a forefinger of warning.

—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine
But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again.

He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:

—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!

He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.

Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:

—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?

—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.

—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?

—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.

—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.

—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.

Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.

—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.

Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.

—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?

—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.

He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.

—After all, Haines began...

Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.

—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your own master, it seems to me.

—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.

—Italian? Haines said.

A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.

—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.

—Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?

—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.

Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.

—I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.

The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.

Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. Zut! Nom de Dieu!

—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.

Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.

—She’s making for Bullock harbour.

The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.

—There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.

The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. Here I am.

They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.

—Is the brother with you, Malachi?

—Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.

—Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.

—Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.

Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.

Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.

—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.

—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.

—Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?

—Yes.

—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with money.

—Is she up the pole?

—Better ask Seymour that.

—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.

He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:

—Redheaded women buck like goats.

He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.

—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the Übermensch. Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.

He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.

—Are you going in here, Malachi?

—Yes. Make room in the bed.

The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.

—Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.

—Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.

Stephen turned away.

—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.

—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.

Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.

—And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.

Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:

—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra.

His plump body plunged.

—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.

Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.

—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.

—Good, Stephen said.

He walked along the upwardcurving path.

La Lupe - a revenge story.,KattiePerryredditLol,1bzidh0,2024-04-08 23:37:32,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KattiePerryredditLol/comments/1bzidh0/la_lupe_a_revenge_story/,Kattie-_sscaryKat80s,,"This is a revenge story of how Lupe was treated and betrayed!

In the year 1567, there was a witch who lived on the outside of a village there were some houses where she was, but not that much. But she lived out there... But she never used to be a witch, she was just a normal girl, she was kind, she was affectionate, and loving, and she had the looks too just like a princess, and she was heading into town to go get her parents some food and water because they had been getting old, but while she was about to go into the market, a FOINE!! handsome man came up behind her. And said ""¡Te ves muy hermosa!"" she responded with ""¡muchas gracias!"" When she looked behind her to see who said those words of affection, she looked and turned to him, his face was masculine and beautiful with a hint of baby face, his skin was soo soft and brown, his hair was so sleek black and clean. He introduced himself as ""¡Holá, yo soy Fernando!"" she also introduced herself and replied ""¡Yo soy Lupe!"" he replied back ""¿Lupe que nombre tan bonito para una chica linda como tú?"" -
""¡Me gusta!"" again she said ""¡Muchas gracias!"" but she felt nervous and said ""Sorry, I have to go, nice meeting you though!"" as she waved before walking away, and went back to doing her task. 

While at the market she thought about getting some tortillas, as those didn't cost that much, they were only 2 cents, she decided to buy 2 packs full of tortillas, she paid, but she wanted to pay the old woman more because why sell tortillas packs for 2 cents, tortillas take a long time to make!? The old woman replied, ""Ay hija, it's nothing, just take them and feed your family. Go! Go!"" she said. The woman was too nice but I accepted and went home, my parents were so glad to see that I have bought some tortillas, and corn and water, and all sorts of stuff for tonights supper and then it's was all good.

Next day -

It was a bright new day in Mexico, kids were running around as usual in the village whenever she got there, and that day happens to be a free day for her, no tasks no nothing, but she wanted to buy some stuff for herself, like some earrings and such, and it was almost her 17th birthday. Her parents couldn't afford much so she decided to save up money for herself, so she can get things she needed and wanted, the same guy Fernando came up to her again. He started off by saying, ""if I weirded you out yesterday, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to creep up on you yesterday. Heh?"" ""But!...here, I got you these!"" he gave her a bouquet of red roses which she liked, ""Aww Fernando!?"" she said affectionately with a bright smile, ""I don't know what to say!?"" "" Oh nothing, but it was just a gift I thought I'd give you."" she ""Well thank you for getting me these. You're so sweet!"" but before she could go, he said, ""Would you want to come by my casa maybe later, or tomorrow?"" she replied back ""I'll see what I can do?"" so she went home, happy and joyful even her parents noticed.

""Your behavior has changed mija?""
said mom, ""That's because I met this guy Fernando."" dad said ""A guy!?"" ""Yes a guy, he's my age and I think he's pretty cute papa?"" ""AY NO! you know what these men could do to you out there."" Mom said ""Love, it's not all bad, unless he's a good person, you shouldn't judge him because he's a man, nor assume, you should only judge him by his character. I mean, who knows, she may have met the right one!"" mom said in a good statement. ""Thank you Mamá!"" Lupe replied, ""I just don't want anything to happen to you mija. I don't want to be mean."" ""It's fine."" Lupe replied again. After dinner she got dressed all pretty and went out, she couldn't find Fernando's house, but she did see a guy so she went up to him and sure enough it was Fernando, he was sitting by the tree reading a book. She sat next to him and asked what he was reading, ""My Bible?"" ""Oh?"" ""Ay no! it's fine."" Fernando in a ""it's okay"" tone. I read it so I can have a close relationship to the Lord, he said. May Diós always be doing with me. 

Fast forward few years later, the relationship kept going on until their wedding day, from that day forward they had a family of their own, and her family was good with his family, it was like a puzzle piece was finally put in its place and was completed. She felt happy, she felt good, but that would all change for worst, that one fateful evening she walked in on her husband sleeping with another woman, she immediately gasped in horror, she said ""How could you you do this!? Why Fernando why!?"" She trusted him and she's been with him for a few years now in the marriage, and had kids with him she felt disgusted, and enraged, so she took her kids with her, she packed all her belongings from the house, meanwhile the other woman just left, as she did not want to get involved. The husband tried explaining himself, but she had heard enough, she was done with his lies and thought about what her dad said years ago, ""You really showed your true colors cabron!!"" I'm leaving goodbye, she said to him while he was just standing there. Little did she know he would snap. Later on that night whenever she was at her parents house and tucking the kids into bed, she heard a crashing sound then some screams coming from her parents bedroom, she came to find them already dead as they had been stabbed multiple times, she was in shock at what she had just seen, it was horrific to her eyes she screamed in anger and fear, and sadness, that somebody would ever do this to her parents. 

Then she heard even more screams coming from her kids, she went back quickly she didn't find them dead yet but she saw that her ex was about to ax them, but before he could even swing at those poor children, she reacted quickly and hit him in the head with the vase, that was meant for her flowers but he knocked out instantly, she took the ax out of his hands and through it somewhere else, not knowing there was another man behind her apparently he had one of his friends come help him with some business, the man tried to stab her but then she heard one of her kids, he had stabbed her daughter Mia, and this was the moment she was really enraged she went crazy and killed her ex and the person that helped him, and lastly her kid, but that's because she was in a trance she went up to her child, and she grabbed something and just took her child's life away, until she had seen what she done to her second child Peto, she was balling out crying at the people around her it was only her there. Once the village people heard the screams, men came running, only to find her covered in (ketchup) her breathing heavily while bawling with tears, one of the men shouted ""¡Ella es una bruja!"" ""What did you do women!!"" Some of the men grabbed her and took her to a camp, full of people like her, she shouted ""It was an accident, it wasn't my fault my ex killed everybody."" she was pleading and pleading, until the guards told her to shut up, the ex-husband was alive and he came, and accused her of killing everybody including the parents, when really he was committing the crimes, she said ""He killed my parents! He killed the people I loved most!! You monster."" she said with tears rolling down her face. Then he said, ""No! You're the monster Lupe! I'm sorry but I couldn't help myself, and when you found out about it I didn't want you to, because it was none of your business anyway and I heard you talking to your parents about it. ¡Pues al diablo con ellos! Adiós, se han ido."" He said in tone of ugly and other pure selfishness, ""Take her away, I don't want to see her ugly face anymore."" And off she went to the prison camp.

For many days to months she was beaten at that camp by guards, she was even r@ped, it was so bad prisoners lived in horrible conditions at the camp, so one day she divides the plan to escape from the camp and leave, and when she was out of there her main goal was revenge on ex, but one night she had a person hand her a book, it was a person in a black cloak, she didn't know who it was and the person didn't speak, the person just slipped her book in the jail cell and walked away, the book look old in the writing was in Latin. It was a book about how to do witchcraft and other stuff and how to curse people, she thought it was interesting and thought it could help her get even more with getting revenge on her ex, she read it and read it until she was even more interested, but she went back to planning her escape. And once she got the cell door unlocked she grabbed her book, and snuck past the guards in out the camp. The next morning the guards couldn't find her she wasn't in here cell, so they put up wanted signs everywhere around Mexico, and she was now the Most wanted woman the first Most wanted woman, she went back to her parent's house to find that it was burnt down to the ground. So she had no choice, but to move to another town in hopes that the new town doesn't know who she really is, so she took all her belongings including the book, and went on her way to Chihuahua Mexico, and this time her house was gonna be way out in the woods, she found an abandoned shack and made it her little witch cottage home, she settled everything she got all the elements she needed from the book to curse her ex-husband. Then she found the jar curse method, but she thought that was too silly and needed something more powerful for her revenge, but she just decided no, so she went all the way back to her hometown, she saw her ex husband that night, she went up behind him and decided to just kill him by stabbing him, and later on she met a guy who also did witchcraft, and she is now married to a Djinn. The End!"

Place: Earth-Sol System-Orion Cygnus Arm

R stood perfectly still on a metal frame, surrounded by copper wiring and masked men covering all of their skin in thick clothes. She had been resting there for the last fifteen minutes. Her master had taken her to what looked like an office building of sorts. She started to contemplate how she got there, and the events that led her to this moment.

“We have some business there.” A tall man had said to the small female drone, who was used to being carried around from meeting to meeting as an assistant to her owner. However, while waiting outside of the room, standing perfectly still, she overheard the conversation the men and women of the company were having.

“We are in a crisis!” one of them exclaimed from the top of his lungs. “We know!” A lady shouted, presumably to the man who had spoken just before. “Please remain calm!” R’s master yelled, silencing everyone in the room. “Firstly, how did all this happen? No one sent me a briefing of the situation.” “Well, that's the problem, we don't know what happened, but our engineers tell us it might have been something with the Solver program”…

“SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THAT THING HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR OVER A MONTH! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!” R’s master was getting increasingly angrier. As this was happening, a tall lady in a black dress walked slowly towards the room, having listened to all the commotion from down in the hall. She opened one of the doors and said “It was the Elliots’ girl.” Everyone turned to the woman by the wooden entrance of the room. “She had been salvaging drones from a scrapyard since she was six, or so they tell me.” “So I'm guessing that one of those was not properly disposed of.” Spoke a man, having seemingly calmed alongside the others in the room.

“Well, whatever it was doing, it certainly did it well.” Said R’s master, contemplating some schematics and blueprints in the roundtable. “You reckon this could help us?” He said as he looked at the woman who had entered earlier. “Perhaps, but I'm unsure  of it.” Said the young woman in response. “Do you think we should test it now with some of the servants?” Asked a man in a blue suit. “Well? How close are we to the nearest Jenson facility?” Answered another man, this time in black clothes. “Alright then, it has-” R’s master sighed, making a short pause, trying to decide on what to say next “-been decided.”

The way to the facility was rather short. It had been a couple of days after the meeting, and R was feeling nervous, so much so that virtual sweat drops were starting to manifest on her visor’s forehead. The chauffeur had been told by the drone’s master to “Please, step up the speed.” since he was apparently “running quite late.” The car stopped dead in its tracks. “We've arrived, sir.” Announced the chauffeur. “Good. R, please get out.” She did so shyly, careful to not get the car dirty. “You may go, Charles.” Said the wealthy man to his servant. “Yes sir.” The man left with the car as both R and her owner walked towards the entrance.

Walking through repeating corridors and halls of white and blue for an extended amount of time had started to make R dizzy. “We've arrived. Now please, rest on the frame and don't move. P” Said the drone’s owner, whose voice sounded quite stressed, and somewhat sad. R did as she was told. A man with glasses came up to her from the left. “Please turn your body upside down, and don't move.” He said to her calmly. She obeyed, turning her back towards the ceiling. The man, who she presumed was an engineer, moved her gray hair from the back of her head, pushing it forward, and revealing a sealed compartment. The stranger removed some screws, and opened the chamber, revealing copper wiring, beeping lights, and electrical entrances. He proceeded to disconnect some cables, and R felt her control over herself wane and dissipate entirely. She was forced to endure as several men opened her body, feeling the pain for hours as they changed the limbs and cables of her body, all while feeling every drop of pain as these ‘men’ turned her into a monster.

After hours of eternal suffering, the men finally shut her down. Moving her body into a transportation pod and sending her off to somewhere else. In her sleep, *‘R’* found not rest, but anger and fear toward the people who had done this to her. And so, her consciousness drifted to a, hopefully, long-lasting slumber.

&#x200B;

*‘R’* was woken abruptly by shaking. The lid that covered the pod opened, revealing to *‘R’* a dark room. “Well well well, who do we have here?” “*‘Y’,* who is this?” “I think she's our new teammate.” Hmm, interesting. I'm *‘A’*. So, how about you tell me your name.” She was in shock, having only just now seen her body since the transformation. She stared at it in distress, unmoving and ignoring the question she had just been asked. “What the… Hey *‘Y’*, you know what's going on?” Asked *‘A’* to the other drone. “Looks like she's in shock, sir. Best to leave her be for a while.” “Alright.” The two drones ended their conversation. Both of them left at the same time, moving into an unseen room.

‘Why did this happen? Why Me WHY ME!?’ *‘R”* could feel her body shaking. All the horror and fear and hate rushed her circuits like a flood, all at the same time. Her arms rose towards her face involuntarily, and she started to sob. Her cries could be heard all around the seemingly empty room. Suddenly, something heavy dropped nearby, but *‘R’* paid no attention to it. She felt an arm touch her metallic face, and she instinctively pushed it out, transforming her hand into a long metallic blade in the process. Her body shot upwards, and she saw it was one of the drones from last night. He had pushed back, scared of what could have happened to him. A drop of oil fell from one of his fingers. *‘R’* saw this, and looking towards her hand, she became scared of herself and what had become of her existence. She started to sob even harder, collapsing into her capsule, with virtual tears rushing down to the end of her visor. The drone, who she presumed was *‘A’*, stared at her, having already healed from the minor wound. He wondered ‘What happened to this drone to cause such pain in her?’ He struggled with himself to act, but eventually decided against it, hoping that whoever this was would be calmer by tomorrow, and would allow him to talk to her.

*‘R’* kept sobbing throughout the night, eventually crying herself to sleep that same morning.

`1500 Hours, January 19, 3057 (Calendario Militar) \              City of Austgeyer, planet of Neue Elbe, Cygnus-Orion Arm`

`A little boy by the age of six was running around a park. “Wilm, come here! Food’s ready!” His mother called from afar. “Yes, Mama!” Answered the little boy, running from the small park towards his house. He crossed the street, not caring to look out for cars. “Remember Wilm, you always have to look out for cars.” Said the mother to her son, caressing his hair. “Yes, mama.” Answered the boy, hugging his mother. “Alright, now. Come on in. I made spaghetti!” “Really?!” “Yes.” “Thanks, mama!” “You're welcome, Wilm.” The boy entered his home, smelling the food his mother had cooked for him.`

`After finishing his meal. He went back to the park. Not noticing his father had arrived. “The teacher said he was doing well for his age.” Told the father to his wife. “I heard. I also heard we might have to move him from school.” Wilm’s mother sighed. “Let's just wait until he finishes school first.” Said her husband. “Are you hungry?” Asked the woman. “No. I had a snack on the way.” Answered the man, putting his arm on the elbow of his partner. “Alright, mind looking at him for a while while I clean?” Asked Wilm’s mother. “Sure.”`

`It was late noon now, and Wilm was tired. He walked towards the street, finally looking out for cars. After finding none, he crossed the street while rubbing his eyes. The air was blowing lightly, moving around Wilm’s short hair. He saw his father sitting by the door, looking at his light brown eyes. “Tired?” Asked his father. “Yes-i.” Said Wilm. “Come on.” Wilm’s dad stretched out his arms and grabbed his son, carrying him while the small child fell asleep. The man went up the stairs and, opening a door, left his son on a small, blue bed, and kissed him goodnight.`

`There was an intense rumbling outside. Wilm felt tired. He opened his eyes and saw several other children on chairs, some sleeping and some crying. There was a dim green light being reflected off of the metal surface of the room from somewhere he couldn’t see. He saw some kids, both older and younger than him, sitting, kneeling, and sleeping on the floor. Some were hugging each other, crying, while others played games or tried to rest. The small child could feel his eyes closing, and not paying attention to his surroundings, went back to sleep, unconsciously resting his head on someone else.`

`The door to the compartment opened, and in came a large amount of light, enough to make Wild cover his eyes as he attempted to adapt to the light. “Surgite, vermes! Omnia in quinque lineis per limam te volo, nunc! (Arise, worms! I want you all in five lines per file, now!)” Esteban gazed at the man, confused as to what the soldier had said. Four other men and women wearing similar uniforms to the shouting man spoke in the same tone as him, only in different tongues. “Steh auf, Maden! Ich will euch jetzt alle in fünf Zeilen hintereinander!” Wilm stood up following the commands spoken in his native language. “Levez-vous, asticots ! Je vous veux tous en cinq lignes, en file indienne, maintenant!” The crying girl rose, now distracted from whatever made her sob. “Arriba, gusanos! Los quiero a todos en cinco lineas singulares, ahora!” Esteban stood up firmly, now paying full attention to the men. “Get up, maggots! I want you all in five single-file lines, now!” The boy hugging the crying girl practically jumped the moment he heard English being spoken.Sic! (Uhm. Yes!)” He replied, happily. While this happened, Wilm heard a close crying, so he turned away from his conversation and found a little girl, no older than him, sobbing loudly. A young boy woke up to her sobbing and hugged her sloppily, she hugged him back, still crying, though more silent this time.`

`A bright light and the sound of sirens woke Wilm from his slumber. He felt something heavy on his rib. He opened his eyes and the first thing he saw were the legs of someone. He turned his face up and saw a small head resting on his body. It was a boy whose eyes were closed and his mouth was open, leaking saliva from his mouth into Wilm’s now wet shirt. The sleeping kid had dark hair, and his skin had a nearly unnoticeable tan. Wilm saw this and shook the kid until he woke. “Warst du schon einmal am Strand? (Have you ever been to the beach?)” He looked confused, perhaps he did not understand what Wilm had said, or perhaps he was dazed from being suddenly woken from his sleep. “¿Mande?” He asked, but Wilm did not know he had, in fact, he didn't know what the child had said, so instead of talking in German, Wilm tried the lingua Franca, Latin, or at least what little he had learned of it. “Vos go litore? (You go beach?)” He said sloppily. The kid, who must have been around the same age as Wilm, raised an eyebrow and looked towards the ceiling, thinking. “Este… Sic! (Uhm. Yes!)” He replied, happily.

Disassembly Unit: 010101010101101101110-R

Date: 12-01-3065

Place: Earth-Sol System-Orion Cygnus Arm

R stood perfectly still on a metal frame, surrounded by copper wiring and masked men covering all of their skin in thick clothes. She had been resting there for the last fifteen minutes. Her master had taken her to what looked like an office building of sorts. She started to contemplate how she got there, and the events that led her to this moment.

“We have some business there.” A tall man had said to the small female drone, who was used to being carried around from meeting to meeting as an assistant to her owner. However, while waiting outside of the room, standing perfectly still, she overheard the conversation the men and women of the company were having.

“We are in a crisis!” one of them exclaimed from the top of his lungs. “We know!” A lady shouted, presumably to the man who had spoken just before. “Please remain calm!” R’s master yelled, silencing everyone in the room. “Firstly, how did all this happen? No one sent me a briefing of the situation.” “Well, that's the problem, we don't know what happened, but our engineers tell us it might have been something with the Solver program”…

“SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THAT THING HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR OVER A MONTH! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!” R’s master was getting increasingly angrier. As this was happening, a tall lady in a black dress walked slowly towards the room, having listened to all the commotion from down in the hall. She opened one of the doors and said “It was the Elliots’ girl.” Everyone turned to the woman by the wooden entrance of the room. “She had been salvaging drones from a scrapyard since she was six, or so they tell me.” “So I'm guessing that one of those was not properly disposed of.” Spoke a man, having seemingly calmed alongside the others in the room.

“Well, whatever it was doing, it certainly did it well.” Said R’s master, contemplating some schematics and blueprints in the roundtable. “You reckon this could help us?” He said as he looked at the woman who had entered earlier. “Perhaps, but I'm unsure  of it.” Said the young woman in response. “Do you think we should test it now with some of the servants?” Asked a man in a blue suit. “Well? How close are we to the nearest Jenson facility?” Answered another man, this time in black clothes. “Alright then, it has-” R’s master sighed, making a short pause, trying to decide on what to say next “-been decided.”

The way to the facility was rather short. It had been a couple of days after the meeting, and R was feeling nervous, so much so that virtual sweat drops were starting to manifest on her visor’s forehead. The chauffeur had been told by the drone’s master to “Please, step up the speed.” since he was apparently “running quite late.” The car stopped dead in its tracks. “We've arrived, sir.” Announced the chauffeur. “Good. R, please get out.” She did so shyly, careful to not get the car dirty. “You may go, Charles.” Said the wealthy man to his servant. “Yes sir.” The man left with the car as both R and her owner walked towards the entrance.

Walking through repeating corridors and halls of white and blue for an extended amount of time had started to make R dizzy. “We've arrived. Now please, rest on the frame and don't move. P” Said the drone’s owner, whose voice sounded quite stressed, and somewhat sad. R did as she was told. A man with glasses came up to her from the left. “Please turn your body upside down, and don't move.” He said to her calmly. She obeyed, turning her back towards the ceiling. The man, who she presumed was an engineer, moved her gray hair from the back of her head, pushing it forward, and revealing a sealed compartment. The stranger removed some screws, and opened the chamber, revealing copper wiring, beeping lights, and electrical entrances. He proceeded to disconnect some cables, and R felt her control over herself wane and dissipate entirely. She was forced to endure as several men opened her body, feeling the pain for hours as they changed the limbs and cables of her body, all while feeling every drop of pain as these ‘men’ turned her into a monster.

After hours of eternal suffering, the men finally shut her down. Moving her body into a transportation pod and sending her off to somewhere else. In her sleep, *‘R’* found not rest, but anger and fear toward the people who had done this to her. And so, her consciousness drifted to a, hopefully, long-lasting slumber.

&#x200B;

*‘R’* was woken abruptly by shaking. The lid that covered the pod opened, revealing to *‘R’* a dark room. “Well well well, who do we have here?” “*‘Y’,* who is this?” “I think she's our new teammate.” Hmm, interesting. I'm *‘A’*. So, how about you tell me your name.” She was in shock, having only just now seen her body since the transformation. She stared at it in distress, unmoving and ignoring the question she had just been asked. “What the… Hey *‘Y’*, you know what's going on?” Asked *‘A’* to the other drone. “Looks like she's in shock, sir. Best to leave her be for a while.” “Alright.” The two drones ended their conversation. Both of them left at the same time, moving into an unseen room.

‘Why did this happen? Why Me WHY ME!?’ *‘R”* could feel her body shaking. All the horror and fear and hate rushed her circuits like a flood, all at the same time. Her arms rose towards her face involuntarily, and she started to sob. Her cries could be heard all around the seemingly empty room. Suddenly, something heavy dropped nearby, but *‘R’* paid no attention to it. She felt an arm touch her metallic face, and she instinctively pushed it out, transforming her hand into a long metallic blade in the process. Her body shot upwards, and she saw it was one of the drones from last night. He had pushed back, scared of what could have happened to him. A drop of oil fell from one of his fingers. *‘R’* saw this, and looking towards her hand, she became scared of herself and what had become of her existence. She started to sob even harder, collapsing into her capsule, with virtual tears rushing down to the end of her visor. The drone, who she presumed was *‘A’*, stared at her, having already healed from the minor wound. He wondered ‘What happened to this drone to cause such pain in her?’ He struggled with himself to act, but eventually decided against it, hoping that whoever this was would be calmer by tomorrow, and would allow him to talk to her.

*‘R’* kept sobbing throughout the night, eventually crying herself to sleep that same morning.

Help! My husband wants to let his mom move in!,u_myredditreadings,1ago2ci,2024-02-01 17:47:53,1,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_myredditreadings/comments/1ago2ci/help_my_husband_wants_to_let_his_mom_move_in/,myredditreadings,,"My husband and I have been together for five years, married for one. His  parents are divorced and he is an only child. MIL never lets him forget  that he's ""all she has."" FIL remarried to a nice lady who has two adult  daughters that we get along with. I actually met my husband through one  of them.

MIL wants to make plans  with us constantly. She tries to keep a full social calendar and gets butthurt if we have previous plans or just want to have a quiet night  in. When we were younger she would pay for us all to do something we  couldn't afford to do as students and take us out to lunch afterwards.  It seemed like she was a nice and generous mom. I regret this now. My  husband is good about telling her no, but we pay for it the next time we  see her. She mopes and asks us how our quiet night in was in a sad  voice. She also gets upset if we hang out with DH's father or  stepsisters.  We didn't know better when we were younger and both did  the whole ""it's easier to lie"" thing. Now we've set a precedent of being  way too careful around her feelings and letting her butt in to our  plans. She is over at our house about four times a week. Usually she  stops by to ""drop something off"" and it's always a bullshit reason.  She's really lonely and she needs real friends.

Her  lease will end soon at her apt and she plans to live on various cruise  ships all summer before she signs a new lease. The plan seems sketchy to  me. Every time she explains it she has a weird reason why she can't go  on a cruise right away or stay in an AirBNB. She's taking the first  cruise in May and then she'll come back in September to start a new job.  The lease ends in TWO WEEKS and she just bothered to ask if she can  stay with us a week ago. She's acting like this is an emergency  situation and she might become homeless and die of the cold.

It  might be paranoid, but I'm afraid that she'll move in and the cruise  plans will magically fall apart. We'd have to evict her and she'd drag  out the process. I don't know what to do. My husband says ""it's just  until May"" but I just don't trust her. I have a bad feeling about this.  Every time we ask her about the cruise stuff she acts shifty and tries  to change the subject. My husband doesn't see it but I do.

If  I was her I'd leave for the cruises now when they're probably less  crowded, still do four months, come back in August instead of September  to be able to get stuff in order for her new apartment and new job. Am I  crazy? That's just makes more sense, right? The plan she has now will  give her three days to get her things together before her new job  starts. Maybe I'm missing crucial details. I don't know.

&#x200B;

**Update to ""help! My husband wants to let MIL move in with us!""**

My MIL is the one who claimed she was going to live on cruise ships all summer.

The  cruise story was fishy, so I started to poke her story with a stick.  First I came up with a ""brilliant idea"" when she came over this  afternoon. She came by to drop off a casserole dish that she ""thought  was ours"" (she didn't really, it was an excuse.) Like usual, she came to  ""drop something off"" but immediately sat down in my living room. I  pulled out my laptop and asked her to tell us which cruises she is going  on so that DH and I can think of joining her for a week!

Normal  MIL would be so excited and jump at the opportunity. She acted awkward  and said that she doesn't know which cruise she will be on yet.

I  acted surprised and said that she probably won't be able to go now,  because it's too late to make such a complicated and specific booking.  She said that it's no trouble and I shouldn't worry about it.

She  is certainly hiding something. My other thought is that it might be  something she is embarrassed by. Maybe she'll be taking a singles cruise  and doesn't want us to know?

I  told DH that she can't move in or I will go bonkers. He said he doesn't  want to deal with her crying and whining when we tell her. I volunteered  to do it (because I don't trust him to give her a firm no!) and I also  said ""what would be worse, hearing her cry now, or having her cry later  when we have to make her leave? If we have to make her go we won't be  able to escape the crying. She'll be in our house. If you say no now, at  least you can hang up the phone!"" This is the argument that won him  over. I can't believe my husband, a grown man, is so afraid of having to  hear someone cry and whine.

&#x200B;

**Easter dinner was a disaster (told MIL she can't live with us)**

I hate holidays with MIL. She gets so upset if there are any other people  there because she needs undivided attention from DH and I. We gave her  Easter because it's a holiday that IDGAF about. I made a comically tiny  roast for the THREE of us, and it was just as awkward as you would  imagine. Most of it was fine. Not great, but fine. Once dessert started,  it became un fracaso grande.

MIL  said ""This evening has been so nice with the three of us. Just think, we  could be doing this every night soon!"" She winked when she said this,  which nearly triggered my gag reflex.

DH  and I had mutually agreed to wait until after the holiday to say  anything to MIL, and we were dumb and didn't have a plan for what to do  if she brought it up first. I looked sideways at him to see if we could  silently agree on something. All he could communicate to me with his  facial expression was ""I'm panicking! Mayday, mayday!"" I just decided I  may as well go for it.

""Actually  MIL, since you brought it up... we have discussed it together a lot and  we decided that we can't host you. We will help you find a place to stay  and help you with moving, but that's all the help we can offer.""

She looked like I slapped her, and asked me why with tears in her eyes.

I  said that we had a bad experience with my family staying for only two  weeks, and that 6 or more weeks was not a burden on my marriage that I  was willing to undertake. I love and value my husband too much.

She  started crying in earnest, mascara running down her face, the whole  nine yards. She was soooo sad we didn't care about her awful situation  and in between sobs acted very upset and blindsided that I could EVER  think that SHE would be a burden on my marriage! (Notice that she  directed it all at me, not DH. He was being silent as a mouse, damn  him.) I couldn't help but feel angry at this. She was the entire reason  that we eloped instead of having an actual wedding, and she crashed our  honeymoon. She has been a burden from the beginning. By god, she  actually interrupted us having sex a few days ago and it wasn't the  first time! We both sat and watched her son and talk about how we have  no regard for her feeeeelings.

I shouldn't have said it, but I said ""to be honest MIL, you're already a burden on my marriage.""

At  this moment she started scream-crying. There is no other way to  describe it. She was clutching her abdomen and just screaming directly  into the table, followed by three heaving sobs, another long scream,  three or four more heavy sobs. It was like she was trying to make as  much noise as she possibly could.

It backfired. Instead of making us guilty, we looked at her like she's a crazy person. This is progress coming from DH.

I  said ""MIL, you seem to be determined to shut this conversation down by  crying, as usual. It's hard to take your tears seriously when you use  them to manipulate us so often.""

She  snapped out of it immediately. It was so fast, I got whiplash. She  looked at me and said ""I will go and cry at home then, where at least I  won't have anyone telling me that I'm a bad person for being upset!"" And  she left. That was it.

All DH and  I could talk about when she left was her immediate 180 sobbing like  someone had died to immediately quieting down when I said that tears  weren't working. It was creepy. Soooo creepy.

She  sent a text an hour later to DH. It was basically asking him if he  agreed with me (said in a way that implied that he couldn't possibly  agree) and if not, what the hell he was going to do about it. Like she  could snap her fingers and make him override his wife for her. He and I  talked about it, and he ended up writing this response to her and  sending it after I agreed it was a good one: ""The decision was mutual.  We can still help you find a new place and move your things."" She texted  back ""don't bother.""

The next  morning I got this text from her: ""I've had some time to think about the  things you said last night, and you're right. The ten minutes I see you  every week must be a terrible burden. Poor you. You won't have to put  up with it anymore. I won't miss having to choke down your disgusting  food. Do us all a favor and stop making that lemon cheesecake, everyone  hates it."" We had the lemon cheesecake for Easter dinner the night  before. It's DH's favorite and he always opts for it instead of birthday  cake, which she is salty about because she used to bake his cake for  him every year. People request it from me all the time. She's full of  shite.

Not that I need to defend  myself to you all, but I'm a good cook. She is just a picky eater. She  hates most spices, onions, all peppers, most beans, any meat with fat  that she can see, tomatoes unless they're puréed, meat with bones, all  seafood, mushrooms, any potatoes other than red potatoes, and most  vegetables. It's hard to serve her food and I do my best, but seriously?  This woman ""hates"" garlic bread. Who hates garlic bread???

That's  the last we've heard from her. DH and I are going to see a couple's  counselor because I insisted. Overall he has started to see my side,  especially after that little show she put on for us on Sunday. He knows  she's a total fucknut, but he still thinks he has obligations to her.  I'm trying to show him that he doesn't, but it's a process.

&#x200B;

**Update on MIL who claims she will live on cruise ships for 4 months**

I  really need a name for her that isn't ""MIL who claims she will live on  cruise ships for 4 months."" I like some of the ones people came up with that  reference her hatred of garlic bread. Lots of funny vampire names were  suggested.

She went 9 whole days  without texting us! Can you believe it? She finally texted DH the  following: ""This is ridiculous. I think I raised you better than this.""  She does this a lot. She sends a cryptic text that shows she's upset and  doesn't say why. She wants people to ask her questions so that she can  unload all of her feelings onto them. She won't do it unless you put up  some pretense by asking her the questions she is fishing for. I find  this so exhausting and I'm trying to get DH to recognize this pattern.  He doesn't see it because he isn't fluent in passive aggressive.  Somehow. Despite being raised by her.

He  didn't take the bait! We discussed it and agreed that her text wasn't  an effort to reach out like an adult. It came across as pissy and rude,  and I'm sure that she is angling for an apology. Not going to happen.

&#x200B;

**Cruise Control has broken her silence**

She finally broke. Her silent treatment never lasts very long. Three weeks is actually pretty impressive coming from her.

She  texted ""I call a truce."" Like we're at war? DH and I have been focusing  on each other and couple's counseling, not planning a surprise attack.

She wants to meet and she has a few odd requests (some of which will NOT fly!)

I  don't have the text, it's on DH's phone and I don't want to be a snoop  so I'll ask him if he can forward it to me later. The one request that  really stands out is that she wants to meet with us separately, because  she doesn't want to be ""outnumbered."" She wants us to meet in a neutral  location and one of us waits in the car while the other gets to be  subjected to her tears. Nice try Cruise Control, but we happen to know  what triangulation is.

She  specifically asked that we don't meet anywhere that has food. She  doesn't want to meet in a restaurant or a coffee house. That's fine,  because it's impossible to find a restaurant that she can stomach with  her long list of dietary dislikes.

DH hasn't responded, but he has read receipts turned on so she knows we got it.

We're  going to think it over and talk about it in counseling, which will be  on Tuesday. She's waited three weeks, she can wait a little longer. The  one thing we immediately agreed on is that we're not doing the bullshit  separate meetings thing. We're a couple, and we'll be treated as such.  The end.

&#x200B;

**Cruise Control is on a hunger strike, please help???**

This  isn't something that she's ever done before. First we got a message  from a friend asking us if she's okay because he saw her at the store  and she looked deathly ill. That was a week ago. We said she's probably  depressed and quickly explained that she wanted to move in. We didn't  think much of it.

Cruise Control  usually texts or calls, so it was strange to us that she was trying to  FaceTime with DH. She called on FaceTime several times and he didn't  pick up.

Finally she just recorded  a video of herself and texted it to him. She has lost a considerable  amount of weight, her eyes look sunken. She really looks bad. In the  video she tells DH that she hasn't been able to make herself eat because  she's so sad that he won't talk to her.

It's  been almost a month and she's lost a LOT of weight. She looks like a  corpse. Do we treat this problem as an eating disorder and try to get  her treatment for anorexia, or do we view this as a really insane  manipulation tactic and refuse to give in? She's literally killing  herself. She's obviously doing this at least partly to get our  attention, otherwise she wouldn't have tried to have face-to-face  meetings and video calls with us.

I  am trying to find out if we can have her involuntarily committed to a  facility that treats eating disorders, but usually it's parents sending  their kids there, not the other way around. It's also too late in the  day to make phone calls, so that will have to wait until tomorrow.

We've reached out to our couple's counselor, but this is really outside of his purview.

&#x200B;

**Cruise Control is surprisingly good at fooling people.**

I've  made calls. I've begged and pleaded. They've seen the video she sent as  well as photos comparing her weight one month ago to her weight now.

She  has them convinced that I am a spiteful daughter in law who has it out  for her. She even has them convinced that I'm jealous of her  (dangerous!! terrifying!!) weight loss.

So  we're wiping our hands of her. Either she's in danger, or she's fine  and it's just a diet. You can't have it both ways Cruise Control. The  narrative right now is that she's fine, so as far as we're concerned  she's fine.

Therapy is good. We've  gotten some great advice on how to handle the situation. DH is still  worried sick, because the situation blows. He's let go of believing that  the solution is in his hands though. He feels strongly that this is all  on her. That's all I can ask for right now, that he won't beat himself  up.

She texted me about how I'm  bitch after she received a welfare check. As always, I am 100% to blame  and DH must not know that I'm doing these things to her. 🙄

DH  has gotten some texts. They're all unrelated to her hunger strike.  She's trying to act like things are normal. She asked him to come to her  apartment and do something to fix her computer (an old favorite  bullshit invented errand of hers.) Well, now we know she's still in her  apartment. I guess her landlord ""changed his mind"" about kicking her  out.

So, that's that. She isn't  being cared for by any professionals, she hasn't been sectioned. I  wonder how bad she really is because she is still going to work,  according to her texts. Maybe she tried to look especially bad in the  video she sent us. For all we know she has faked the whole thing. We  haven't seen her in person.

Until she deteriorates even more, there's not much we can do.

&#x200B;

**Cruise Control has been hospitalized for dehydration**

DH  got the call from the hospital and then he called me. Cruise Control  went to work this morning and then collapsed. She was taken to the  hospital and she's being given fluids because she was so dehydrated.  That's all we know.

The call  wasn't from Cruise Control and it didn't come from her cell phone. The  call was through work, and the call was forwarded to his desk.  Assumedly, Cruise Control told a nurse DH's name and workplace and asked  them to notify him. She knows we ignore calls from her number.

We're  debating how to proceed. We're both still at work. DH thinks it would  be good to give her healthcare providers some info (such as the video)  but I told him that we don't know if she's really starving herself, we  just know what she claims. If she's starving herself then doctors and  nurses will be able to tell. Surely that would be one of the first  things they'd notice?

I want to show her that we will *not*  magically reappear the moment her ass hits a hospital bed. I keep  telling him that I'm worried that she will learn that putting herself in  the hospital is the best way to get our attention. If she does this  over and over, she will destroy her kidneys.

Part  of me wants to just call the hospital myself and then text DH that I've  already handled it, but I'm trying to let him think his way through  this stuff and coming to a good solution himself. The therapist warned  me against infantilizing him because I've expressed frustration with him  in a way that shows I don't think he's capable of making the smart  choice. Since his mom already treats him like a child, I need to show  him that I know and believe he is a capable adult. This will be my  exercise in showing him I believe in him. I told him my thoughts and  concerns. Now he needs to choose.

UPDATE:  DH took his lunch break early to drive to the hospital. He called ahead  and asked to talk to her docs in private. He's going to explain that  our therapist has advised us not to see her in the hospital (we went  over this scenario when we learned about the hunger strike) and he's  going to show them the video and let them know that APS has already  investigated. As long as he manages to do this without Cruise Control  getting a visit from him, I'm happy.

&#x200B;

**Went to therapy with Cruise Control and it was ehhh**

This was a while ago but I waited to post it because it took DH and I a while to absorb it and talk it over.

Our  own therapist that we've been seeing (who we really like!) gave us the  advice that we should act businesslike and refuse to give hugs or make  small talk. Not to be mean, but to make sure that therapy with Cruise  Control doesn't become a way for her to sneak around LC and force  interaction. We needed to set the tone for serious work to be done  rather than rug sweeping.

So of  course we show up and Cruise Control fucking leaps at us. DH and I  dodged her and DH said ""Mom, this is not the time nor the place. We all  need to take this seriously."" She said ""not even a hug?"" and he replied  ""Not even a hug."" Go DH!

We had  emailed the therapist beforehand but we also brought a hard copy of our  list. Therapist asked us if we had anything to say before we got  started. DH piped up and said ""yes, I want to address what just happened  outside of the office so that Cruise Control understands our  reasoning."" We spent a few minutes on that and Cruise Control said she  understood.

The therapist said  that she was going to focus on the bullet points on our list that  involve the three of us rather than those that are observational about  Cruise Control's behavior (understandable) and she went straight for the  moving-in debacle. I was glad because we *still* don't understand what was going on and we can't be 100% sure that she wanted to live with us permanently.

When  it was time for Cruise Control to start talking she was tearing up. She  said that she hated her apartment and wanted to leave, it was too dark  and it makes her depressed, and she had decided to live on cruise ships  for half the summer. DH said ""you told us you would be doing it for four  months and now it's one month?"" And she said that she had other plans  for the middle of the summer that she couldn't tell us about because she  felt that DH's feelings would be hurt.

We  had no idea what she was talking about. I can't think of a vacation  she'd be able to go on that would hurt our feelings, other than crashing  our own....

The therapist said  that if feelings are going to be hurt, therapy is a good place to  process that. She sighed and said okay, and then she tells us her ""real  plans"" that I still think are sketchy as fuck.

Now  her story is ""I felt that you would be lonely without me all summer so I  wanted to stay with you for a while so you know I still care about you!  I met a man online who lives in (vacation destination) and we were  going to spend a month together. I was going to take a cruise before and  after the trip to see this man so that I could say that I met him on  the cruise by accident. I just didn't want you to feel abandoned.""

We were just like WTF? Why would we care if you're dating? We'd both be ecstatic!

DH reminded her that he has a close relationship with his stepmom and dad.

I said that we'd be happy to see her find someone to spend time with because she seems lonely.

Cruise  Control REFUSED to accept this. She believed we must be lying to her  and that DH would have been distraught if she moved on from her divorce  in the late Cretaceous era.

Therapist kept saying to Cruise Control that we seemed pretty genuine.

Now  that we were on the subject, we spoke for a while about what a burden  it is to be 100% of her social calendar and how we would love to see her  find some friends or a hobby.

DH  said that he was worried about the new job and whether it was real and  hoped she was going to be okay, because we can't take her in if her  employment doesn't work out.

When  asked if the job is real, she just said ""the job is there if I want it.""  She couldn't give us a yes or no. I am terrified that she's going to  suddenly become desperate for a place to live and neeeed us to help her.

The  last thing we did was state our boundaries. We said she cannot live  with us EVER and that's a hard boundary. We said we'd do therapy with  her no more than twice a month and that we would stop if we suspected  she was lying to the therapist or using therapy as a way to get her DH  fix instead of working on herself. We also said we were unwilling to let  visits get to the point they were ever again. We understood that  ""weaning her off"" might be good for her but it would be very very bad  for us. We also shared a list of things we'd like to see from her, like  an apology, genuine attempts to find new people to socialize with,  honesty, and for her to get used to the fact that DH's stepfamily is a  huge part of our lives.

We haven't  agreed to go back and we haven't been asked. All we can hope for is  that we gave the therapist some things to ask Cruise Control about. She  needs a diagnosis like yesterday.

We  haven't been seeing her in person. We have a policy she doesn't know  about, which is that she can call all she wants but we will only pick up  twice a week. If she calls more than once in a day she's on a secret  time-out. She hasn't tried to ""drop by"" because she knows that means  time out for a long time. We've been seeing my family and DH's  dad/stepfamily a lot more, which has been wonderful.

&#x200B;

**Cruise Control's mask slipped and she ruined July 4th.**

The good news is that I am at ease about how sincere Cruise Control has been in her ""recovery."" Answer: not very.

The bad news is that she broke my nice mixing bowls and wasted a lot of booze.

DH  and I aren't huge July 4th people or anything, but we decided to go  ahead and invite some family and friends over. This was actually on  Saturday, not the actual 4th, because of work. We did NOT invite Cruise  Control. We invited FIL (so, her ex-husband) and stepmom/stepsisters in  law and their SOs, as well as my parents and brothers and brother's  girlfriend. We had some friends from college that brought their adorable  baby. We also had some friends that live in the neighborhood come by as  part of a party hopping thing that people in our neighborhood like to  participate in. We stayed camped in the backyard with the grill going  and the front and back doors open. Anyone who was invited knows to just  let themselves in if we don't hear you.

I  was fucking proud of the spread. I made easy oven ribs because we  didn't have the grill space to do them right, but let's be honest-- even  oven ribs are pretty good. I made homemade salsa. I sprung for the good  tortilla chips. We had cucumber salad, corn on the cob, cherry pie,  coleslaw, burgers, steak and pork kebabs in my special marinade, and  watermelon salad. We had enough to feed an army too. I'm not a party  planner by any means but it looked fucking nice! The food looked  colorful and delicious and the smells from the grilling food were the  first thing our guests commented on when they showed.

I'm setting up the whole scene to show you how fucking heartbreaking this was, obviously.

Party  is in full swing. People are loading up their second and third plates  by the time Cruise Control shows up. Our friends with the baby are  saying their goodbyes because it's time to go home and put the kid to  bed. They're a bit freaked out after the poor kid tried to grab a  flaming sparkler.

We thought  they'd left and the dad comes back into our backyard and says ""uhhh your  mom's here"" to DH. These are good friends who know the situation.

We  both go out front to see what's going on. Poor mom is holding her baby  and clearly wants to go home but she's a good friend and is stalling  Cruise Control for our benefit because she's wonderful.

DH: ""Mom, what are you doing here?""

CC: ""I was just driving by and I saw that you were having an open house, so I thought I'd stop in for a few minutes.""

Me: ""This isn't an open house.""

CC: ""Can i come in?""

DH: ""Mom, you know that isn't a good idea. Dad and stepmom are here. No one here was expecting you to come either.""

CC: ""I'm sure they won't mind me!""

Me: ""that's not what we're worried about. Are you really ready to face them?""

CC: ""I'm sure it will be fine.""

DH:  ""that might be true, but this wasn't planned. I don't want this party  to be the guinea pig. Please leave, we'll arrange something in the  future so no one is blindsided.""

CC: ""blindsided? Kind of like how I am right now? You didn't invite me to a party!""

Me:  ""Yeah, we didn't invite you. That's not new though. We have parties  without you all the time because you don't like to attend them if FIL  and SMIL are there. We've been doing this for years and you've always  known about it.""

(This is true. We  either make a separate holiday for just her on the weekend or on the  actual day and FIL and my family get to have whatever is available. It's  fucking stupid and we didn't do t this time because we're not meeting  with her right now.)

Cruise  Control continued to try to talk her way into the party and DH and I  JADE-ed way too hard, which we kicked ourselves for later. I finally  went back inside because I had stuff in the oven to watch and left them  to it.

Next thing I know Cruise Control has successfully talked her way into the house. Way to go, DH :(

I  was taking a pie out of the oven when she walked into the kitchen and  started lecturing me about how I'd put up photos in the living room just  to hurt her. In a previous post I mentioned that she flips out if we  put photos of DH's dad and stepfamily on the walls or fridge so we keep  them upstairs where she won't see them. In a moment of righteous anger I  rearranged our photo wall to be more balanced and show some treasured  memories of DH's awesome family who has been put through so much by this  woman. She's still on the wall so she can choke for all I care.

I told her so, in different, nicer words. She didn't respond, just flounced outside.

I  didn't see what happened next, but I had it told to me many times.  First she got really upset that we had alcohol (she is vaguely religious  and super, super anti-alcohol. We hide our beer and wine when she comes  over because she cries if she sees a beer in our fridge.) She asked DH  if it was really necessary. My dad was a little tipsy and said something  like ""none of this is necessary, but it sure is nice!"" She got upset  and walked to te other side of the yard and glared. She spent some time  looking around to see if anyone was watching her and she snuck over to  the coolers, which were sitting on a table, and she pushed the one full  of margarita over. She claimed that she lost her balance and it was an  accident. She was seen plotting this for a while. Fucking asshole.

The  cooler less than half full and everyone had pretty much had their full  of margaritas at any rate-- but she FUCKING SLOSHED MARGARITAS INTO HALF  OF THE FOOD!!! Soggy Tequila-flavored tortilla chips, anyone? Boozy  coleslaw? How about some margarita burgers?

There  was stuff inside the house and on the grill, but now the tables were  sticky and all of my salsa was ruined. That salsa had been made the day  before so that the flavors would marry and it was sooooo good, you guys.  I'm so sad about that poor salsa. I was looking forward to my  leftovers.

I walked up to her when  I heard what happened and I said ""Cruise Control, it seems like you're  having a really bad time at this party. It's not really your scene.  Maybe you should go home and let us call you when we're ready to arrange  something more to your tastes, okay?"" And I grabbed her elbow and  guided her out of our backyard through the garden gate.

She  claimed she left her purse in my kitchen (of course she did. Classic  move!) and she ""accidentally"" threw my ceramic mixing bowl set on the  floor. Yes, the whole set. They nest and were NOT sitting near the edge  of the counter. She was all apologies and I looked at her and said  ""would you rather write me a check now or later?""

She  said she had no checkbook on her person and she'd write me a check  later. And she will, if she ever wants to see us again. That mixing bowl  set was a wedding gift and it was NOT cheap. It's the kind that's so  pretty that you display it. I've dropped pieces from it before and it  didn't even chip, so I have to assume that she put some force into her  ""mistake.""

The rest of the party  was weird and awkward. Everyone silently ate until the ribs were gone  and then someone finally kind of said ""what the fuck was that about?""  The party turned into people telling stories about other parties that  were ruined by an intruder.

DH and  I are talking a lot more seriously about the NC for one year idea.  AFTER I get a check, if possible. I've also told him that next time the  door is to be locked and the police are to be called if it comes to  that. He agreed. He said he thought she'd just run away the moment she  saw FIL. I pointed out that she practically did, she was there for maybe  ten minutes. I said something like ""she wasted $20 in tequila and I  don't know how much in kitchenware in ten minutes, so ten minutes of her  in our house is pretty expensive."" We're going to keep reminding  ourselves how much this cost.

She  has texted us since then to say ""so sorry again, let me know if I can do  anything to repay you!"" And DH texted back ""you can do just that, repay  us."" No response to that. She seem to be implying she wants to do some  favors for us and we'll call it even? Yeah, no.

&#x200B;

 

**Cruise Control knows just the way to get us to regret going NC with her!**

Cruise  Control (my crazy MIL who we recently went NC with) has been a lot  calmer than we expected. She blew up DH's phone before he blocked her,  and she peered through our windows once. I scared her off.  I expected world war 3 so this has  been... pleasant?

The silence couldn't last, so here's the latest in the exciting world of nope.

Cruise  Control came to the house when DH and I were both at work with a large  manila envelope. She didn't take the steps up onto the porch-- she just  tossed the envelope like a frisbee and hightailed it out of there. I  guess she thinks she's invisible to our ring doorbell unless she steps  onto the porch. She isn't.

I took  one for the team and opened it when we both were home. It was large  prints of photos of Cruise Control, and a note explaining that they're  for our photo wall.

If you're  lucky enough to be hearing about the lunacy of Cruise Control for the  first time right now, I'll explain. She has a grudge against her  ex-husband (FIL) and that extends to his lovely wife and his  stepdaughters, who are both friends of mine. She would flip out and cry  if we had photos of any of those family members within her sight. I got  pissed one day and I updated the photo wall in our living room to  include ALL of our family members. Cruise Control was still in it, for  fucks sake. We believe that seeing those photos is what caused her  tantrum that caused us to go NC with her.

It's  insane to me that she hasn't heard from us in weeks and has spent all  of this time frothing at the mouth about what our living room wall looks  like!

I don't know what to do with the photos. I'm thinking of investing in a dartboard. Thoughts?"

***Memory transcription subject: Nedaul, Tulsek Combat Medic for Krakotl Extermination Fleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 20th, 2136*

The ship was brutish, typical of Arxur design. The grays didn’t share the Humans’ eye for artistry. Functionality was the one and only concern. The massive transport loomed under the hazy sky like a beast ready to snap us up. But, I knew the real threats were the monsters aboard.

*Why are they here? Are they capitalizing on Earth’s lack of defenses like they did with The Cradle?*

Every fiber of my being screamed at me to run. We were hardly capable of taking on an entire Arxur transport. Yet, Dean continued towards the thing, actually speeding up as he did so.

“Th-that’s an Arxur ship!” I sputtered.

“I know,” Dean replied.

“Then s-stop! We can’t go th-that way! They’ll k-kill us!”

“No they won’t. George just gave me all the details over the phone. They’re here to offer aid.”

That couldn’t be true. The grays never helped anybody.

*Then again, have they ever had allies? Fellow predators…*

“I knew it…” my heart rate increased as realization hit me. “You’re in league with them!”

“Now, hold on-,” Dean started, but I cut him off before he could finish his thought.

“It’s in your accursed nature! You’re planning to take over the Federation together. You want us all as your cattle!”

*Oh, Kha-Taul. I can’t be here. I need to get away!*

Losing any regard for my own safety, my left claw gripped into Dean’s side while I beat my right claw against his body repeatedly. I didn’t care what happened; I had to get off the bike. He was *not* about to bring me into the Arxur’s clutches. I’d rather die than become *their* livestock.

“Ow! Fuck! Hey!” the Human put an arm up to block the incoming blows.

The bike rolled to a stop. Dean swung one leg over the seat and whipped around, catching my wrist in his grip. Ignoring his clear control over the situation, I began to fling my left claw wildly at him. But, he simply stopped it with his other hand and pulled me off of the bike with him.

“Quit it!” he growled.

The thought of being handed off to the grays was too much for me to handle. Fear overrode my training and my knees buckled, causing me to become dead weight in his grasp. I was heavier than usual with the bags of flesh still hanging from my shoulders, so the graying Human struggled to support me.

“D-don’t let them t-take me!” I stammered. “I've seen wh-what they do!”

“Fucking damn it, Bloodhound. Calm down! We don’t have time for this! Just…breathe for a second.”

My panicked mind grappled onto Dean’s instructions, desperate for anything that could provide me some focus. I dug into the ground with my foot paws and tried to regain control of myself.

*Breathe. Just breathe.*

As my consciousness began to catch up to my instincts, my shaking receded and I was able to look up at Dean again. Even with the harshness in his voice, his expression was still blank. I knew that he wasn’t a threat to me yet, but I had to pull myself together before his irritation turned him into one.

I stood up to my full height, prompting Dean to finally release his grip on my wrists. Brushing the brambles out of my fur, my breathing slowly returned to a normal rate.

*We can't go to that ship.*

Though my head was clearing up, I still refused to get back on the bike until Dean changed his mind. Dealing with Arxur was not on the table.

“You s-said you thought the grays were evil!” I huffed in frustration. “Why are you accepting aid from th-them?”

“Do you have any idea how many people we’ve lost?” Dean questioned me back. “George said that initial estimates put the death toll at around a billion. *One billion souls* lost in the bombing…At this point, I'm sure the UN will accept aid from anyone. The Venlil are here to help, too, even alongside the Arxur.”

*One billion Humans…dead…*

“If anything, this is *your* fleet’s doing,” he continued. “As far as I know, the UN was aligned *against* those lizards until Federation species started sending fleets to kill us. If you’d quit backing us into corners, maybe it wouldn’t have come to this.”

*I don’t care what the Humans’ justification is. The grays are a scourge on the entire galaxy.*

“If you t-truly believe that they’re evil, you should h-have let yourselves die before r-receiving their help,” I muttered. “They t-take people as cattle and t-torture innocents. Entire species have b-been wiped out by the grays. Back h-home, we’d sacrifice *every* Tulsek before acception h-help from the grays.”

“Well, I’m not a Tulsek,” Dean shot back. “My top priority is dealing with Cole. He’s the immediate threat that needs to be brought down. But, the bike is almost out of charge and we can’t continue on without it. The Arxur ship will have power aboard. If they can charge-”

“Charge the bike?!” I scoffed. “Even if they *are* w-willing to help you, they’ll eat *me* without a second th-thought. If you give a sh-shit about *my* experience, their ‘aid’ is p-probably some kind of trap. The m-moment we’re in their clutches, they’ll k-kill us both. I’m *not* going over th-there. If we’re still going to p-pursue Cole, we need to find a d-different path.”

Dean shook his head, standing resolute in his decision.

“I’m going to that ship regardless of your *experience*. They’ve had their opportunity to occupy us and have chosen to aid rescue efforts instead. Without the Arxur, we’d *all* be wiped out already. That includes you.”

Realization dawned on me. I understood why he’d been so secretive about what happened to the extermination fleet.

“Y-you knew the grays were involved f-from the beginning d-didn't you?” I asked. “I th-thought your communications were d-down…”

“They went down just after the lizards joined the fight. Then, all hell broke loose and our relays got fried. Honestly, I thought they were here to pounce on us after what we did to them at The Cradle. But, I guess they hate you guys more.”

Dean turned his gaze to the massive hunk of metal that sat on the road ahead. The thing stood starkly like its mere existence broadcasted a threat, and if it had eyes, I figured that they'd be pointed right at me.

*That must be why the bombing failed. After we crashed, the grays showed up to stop our fleet. But why protect the Humans? Because they’re also predators?*

“The bike is nearly out of charge here,” Dean reiterated before I could scold his omission of details. “At this point, I don’t think we could even make it to the last station if we turned around.”

“I’m n-not going with you to that ship. It’s s-suicide.”

The patches of fur above his eyes lowered slightly. I still wasn't fully familiar with his body language, but I knew that he wasn't happy.

“Okay then, I’ll offer you a choice. Either you can come with me and I can protect you from the Arxur myself, or I’ll cuff you to a tree and go over there alone. Regardless, I still need your sense of smell, so once I get the bike charged, I’ll come back for you and we’ll take a wider route. Just know that, if they’re scouting the area around the ship and they find you while I’m gone, you won’t have any deterrent or way to escape.”

*Both of these choices are predator-shit!*

“You’re cruel,” I growled.

“There’s no time to be nice. Cole is only getting further away.”

Dean was unyielding. He was going to the Arxur ship no matter what I said. So, I tried to consider the situation logically, just like I had when he requested my help before.

If I went with him, I’d be venturing right into the lair of the beasts, but I’d have a beast of my own to protect me. The grays were apparently here to offer aid to Humans, so maybe I’d be safe under Dean’s custody.

If I let him cuff me to a tree, I’d be a vulnerable target. Even though the Arxur ship was a ways up ahead, the monsters themselves might be moving throughout the whole area. I knew for a fact that if one found me incapacitated, they’d make a meal out of me without hesitation. Plus, I didn’t know if there were predatory fauna native to the area.

*Is going with Dean really the best choice?*

I once again considered trying to escape from Dean himself, but with his attention fully on me, I definitely didn’t have a chance. Just moments ago, he'd handled my thrashing about like it was nothing. If escaping were within the realm of possibility, I would have already gotten away.

Like it or not, I had to pick my poison. There were no alternatives.

“Fine,” I conceded. “I’ll g-go with you. But, I think we’re b-both as good as dead. If they t-try to take us as cattle, will you at least sh-shoot me first?”

“I won't let that happen,” Dean assured me. “If they try anything, I'll handle it.”

Dean clearly didn't know what he was getting us into. The grays were the stuff of nightmares. They'd been waging a one-species war against the Federation for generations. These monsters weren't something he could just *handle*.

Despite my objection, we both climbed back onto the bike and shot towards our certain demise.

My paws shook as I said my silent prayers to Kha-Taul. Dean took notice of my trembling as I held his sides tightly.

“You'll need to stay calm during this. I know what they've done to your people, but if you panic, I won't be able to protect you. You're a soldier, right? Act like one.”

As much as I wanted to shout at him for his naivety, I forced myself to breathe slowly. I couldn't stop my claws from shaking completely, but I was able to make it less noticeable.

The bags of meat hanging from my shoulders felt heavier than before, and the tracking collar seemed tighter around my neck. Up above, the clouds once more swallowed the sunlight, dimming the vibrant rays as they passed through.

Everything about the situation felt wrong, doomed to failure. Even the bike seemed to agree as the hum of its motors gradually lowered in pitch.

*This thing isn't going to make it much further. Maybe it'll run out of battery before we reach the ship and I'll have more time to talk Dean out of this lunacy.*

As we drew closer to the massive transport, I was able to make out a few more details. They'd set up an encampment that extended out into the road, forming a kind of checkpoint. The grays’ terrible forms moved around between the makeshift structures, hunched over slightly in their slinking motions.

Then, I started to smell their rations.

The scent of Cole’s blood paled in comparison to the awful cuts that they stored on their ship. The odor was pungent and nauseating, and I had to fight the urge to gag as it became more noticeable.

*Those were once people, killed and turned into predator meal. Oh, Kha-Taul…That's going to be me too…*

I whimpered and tightened my grip on Dean.

“I c-can smell the corpses…”

The motor hummed lower and lower, signaling that the bike was nearing the end of its charge.

“Keep it together,” Dean replied, a slight soothing quality in his voice. “We’re going to be alright.”

There was tension in his body too. Even as he gave me his reassurance, the predator in front of me was feeling uneasy.

The checkpoint was close now, many of the illness-spawned beasts turning their heads to regard us. I couldn't quite see their eyes yet, but I knew that they'd make Dean’s binocular gaze seem like a warm hug by comparison.

*Falkit…I'm sorry…I think I'm going to die here.*

Several of the grays moved towards us, weapons in claw. They smelled like the remnants of their victims, a testament to their terrible existence.

The bike continued its gradual deceleration as we drew nearer.

“Looks like we’re just about going to make it,” Dean mumbled.

I wanted to jump off the bike and run. My instincts were like an inferno in my mind, but I knew that Dean’s reasoning was correct. I *had* to keep my wits about me. It was the only chance I had at survival.

For some reason, my mind drifted back to *The Porcelain Rabbit*. The story anchored me in my last vestiges of consciousness. I readily accepted the bastion of stability.

*”Your meal shall not come easily,” Elijah countered, removing a dagger from his satchel. “We are not the simple game that wander into this cave unprepared.”*

The bike’s motors whirred lower and lower as we pulled into the encampment, stopping just in front of the awaiting grays. The battery seemed to be fully depleted. Our timing would have been comical, if not for how dire the situation was.

*I was right about their eyes. Dean’s are preferable. Kha-Taul, protect me.*

One Arxur stepped forward from the rest of the group. Dean always seemed large in isolation, but this thing was massive. Its muscular body was ravaged with awful scars, the result of years of unfathomable violence, contests for dominance.

The beast turned its hungry gaze to me, baring massive fangs as it did so. Then, it swiveled to Dean, looking the Human up and down, potentially assessing his strength.

“Human, I understand that you were informed to stay sheltered. Why are you here, and why have you brought this leaf-licking Federation *prey* along with you?”

The translator indicated that the thing was a female. I'd never heard a gray speak before. Her voice was rugged and deeper than Dean’s. Each word was formed with growls and hisses.

“My name is Dean Sullivan,” the Human answered flatly. “I'm a prison warden. One of my prisoners has escaped, and I am trying to recapture him. Bloodhound, here, is helping me track him with her sense of smell.”

The Arxur bared her fangs even more, letting out a grating, barking sound that my translator said was laughter. My claws tightened their grip around Dean’s body.

“Hunting with prey? You must be desperate, Dean Sullivan. Certainly, you could form a better hunting party than this, yes?”

“Humans don't track scents well,” Dean explained. “And, I didn't have the resources for a full manhunt. The local police have their hands full as it is. This was the best I could do on short notice.”

“Perhaps we could make a deal, then,” the beast’s eyes locked onto me once more. “It seems that you have *much* to trade.”

“I'd like to learn your name first,” Dean deflected the Arxur’s implication. “And, why are you posted on this road, anyway? Like you said, everyone is supposed to be taking shelter.”

The Arxur’s eyes abandoned me, snapping back to Dean.

“I am Captain Senleth. We are here because this has been a hotspot for crashed Federation ships, though it seems that you are already aware of that, given the sniveling specimen seated behind you.”

“You’re dealing with stragglers then,” Dean reasoned.

“Indeed.”

*Dealing with my comrades…Eating their flesh…*

“Well, it seems our bike is now completely out of power,” Dean motioned towards the now-useless vehicle we were seated upon. “Mind giving us a charge?”

“That depends,” the captain replied as she walked a slow circle around us. “Chief Hunter Isif ordered us to protect the city up ahead from crash-landed Federation troops. And, wouldn't you know it, there's one *right here*.”

She was behind me now. I could feel her piercing gaze like claws in my back.

“She stays with me,” Dean replied curtly. “I need her senses to track my target.”

“Why settle for such a miserable creature? I could lend you a pair of capable hunters *and* get your bike charged. Just hand the leaf-licker over to me. Everyone can walk away happy.”

*This is it. Dean has no reason to refuse this offer. His hunt would go much better with fellow predators. He has no obligation to protect me anymore.*

“Tell me, Captain Senleth, can you smell the blood of a Human that passed by this area?” Dean queried.

“All I smell is the blood of our food supply, the remnants of passing vehicles, and your pet’s *fear*,” the beast answered. “Why?”

“Bloodhound is currently tracking our target. Right now, scent is the only reliable way we have of following the escaped convict. I’m sorry, captain. I’m sure your hunters are very capable, but I do believe that her more sensitive snout is the most valuable thing I could currently have at my disposal.”

*He…doesn’t want to hunt with other predators?*

“I do have a counter-offer for you, however,” Dean continued. “You *only* charge the bike. In exchange, you can have the contents of these bags. Bloodhound, if you would.”

He extended an open hand behind him. Realizing his plan, I removed one of the hefty sacks from my shoulder and passed it forward. Dean brought the bag to the front, opened it up, and removed one of the packages of flesh. He tore the thing open and extended it towards the captain.

Senleth took the stick of meat willingly, sniffing it a couple times before tossing it into her gaping maw.

“Are all the bags filled with that?” the gray asked.

“They are,” Dean assured her.

“Very well. I accept your strange terms, Dean Sullivan. Your bike will be charged shortly. There’s a tent over there that you may wait under. Do not let the leaf-licker out of your sight. I cannot guarantee its survival otherwise. Personally, I think you’re wasting your time with such a pathetic creature.”

“Understood. I’ll keep my eye on her.”

The two of us climbed off of the bike and a pair of Arxur wheeled it away. I handed the remaining bags of jerky to Dean, who then passed them to Senleth. My body was still shaking amidst the throes of beasts. But, somehow, I was still alive.

“Come on,” Dean motioned for me to follow him over to the designated tent.

I forced my wobbly legs to move me deeper into the camp. My mind was focused solely on staying close to the Human in front of me. The grays eyed us from every angle, a relentless torrent of predatory staring.

I’d been on the ground during the tail end of Arxur raids before. But, as a medic, I was always a part of the backline, dealing with the aftermath and trying to save the mortally wounded.

My frontline here was a singular predator, one significantly smaller than my opposition. The only thing that protected me was their bargain, and the only thing that made the bargain possible was a mysterious chief hunter’s orders to provide aid to the Humans.

*We need to get out of here as soon as the bike is charged. The longer we stay, the more dangerous this gets.*

I nearly ran into Dean’s back when he stopped under the tent’s cover. Taking our seats within the small patch of shelter, I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the monstrous grays that surrounded us.

Unfortunately, that only brought the smell of their rations back to the forefront of my mind. I opened my eyes again and forced my focus onto Dean. Despite his own terrifying form, he was the only anchor of familiarity amidst the hostile surroundings.

I scooted in closer to him, finding his presence oddly comforting.

“H-how long will this t-take?” I whispered.

“Hopefully, it’ll be done soon,” he replied. “Cole won’t stop to wait for us.”

“I j-just want to get out of h-here.”

“Yeah…me too. This whole place gives me the fucking creeps.”

Dean’s head was on a constant swivel, not in search of prey, I realized, but scanning for threats.

“At l-least they don’t w-want to eat you,” I felt my claws shake a little more. “If th-they had their way, I’d b-be devoured or turned into l-livestock. Did you bring th-the jerky because you knew th-this would happen?”

“I knew there might be Arxur in the area, and I knew that they’d see you only as food. If it came down to it, I wanted to have something else to give them. It’s not that I thought this *would* happen. I just wanted to be ready if it did.”

*If we’d shown the same level of forethought during the bombing, we probably would have succeeded in glassing the planet. Kalsim has often been regarded as a passionate leader, but this mission has been a disaster.*

Dean and I remained quiet while we waited, matching the energy of the grays that surrounded us. None of them seemed much for conversation, common for what I knew about predators.

Though, thinking back, Humans had been comparatively social in my experience. While Dean didn’t speak to *me* much without my prompting, he often made comments to himself or spoke easily with other Humans.

*Just another strange anomaly in Human behavior. We should have learned more about them before commencing our attack. That knowledge might have been valuable.*

*Or maybe we* did *know this, and I just didn't pay attention during the briefing…*

Kha-Taul’s breath whipped against the tent’s fabric, filling up the space that the silence left open. I considered asking Dean to play *The Porcelain Rabbit* again, but I didn’t want to draw the attention of the grays any more than I already did by being there.

Luckily, I didn’t have to suffer the waking nightmare for long. It was only a short wait before the bike was returned to us. Senleth stood behind it, enjoying another piece of jerky.

“It’s fully charged,” she stated, mouth full of the wretched meat. “I still don’t understand why you're sticking with that leaf-licker, but the rations are good, so I won’t pry. Happy hunting, Dean Sullivan.”

Dean nodded as we both mounted the bike. He didn’t reply to the Arxur’s farewell. Instead, he just started the thing up and twisted the throttle. We zipped forward, following the road out of the camp as fast as we could. No one pursued us, true to their word.

Eventually the awful scents of corpses began to diminish and the only blood remaining in the air was Cole’s.

“We’re getting close to Columbus,” Dean broke the heavy silence. “It’s a pretty big place, probably Cole’s destination. We *are* still following the right scent, right?”

“I’d tell you if we weren’t,” I replied. “At this point. I just want this to be over.”

“You and me both.”

The sound of the bike’s tires rolling over the pavement seemed to emanate from miles away. It felt like I wasn't in my own body, merely observing it from the outside. My claws gripped Dean’s body tightly as though they received direction from someone else. Every thought in my mind seemed to be one of disbelief.

*I'm…still alive…*

I felt the tears rolling down my cheek before I noticed the stinging in my eyes. Tiny sobs wracked my body and I pulled my legs in close.

“What's wrong?” Dean’s words signaled concern, though his tone, as usual, did not.

“I…really thought I was going to die,” I answered between the sharp, shallow breaths. “Sorry…I guess it's just now hitting me. I'll stop.”

I sniffled a couple of times and blinked back any remaining tears. There was still a predator in front of me. I couldn't afford to show that weakness.

*Come on, Nedaul. Pull it together…*

“Why did you negotiate for my life?” I asked, still in disbelief. “The grays would be better hunters than me. They were right. I'm not built for this.”

“I already gave my reason. Scent is the best way I have of tracking Cole, and your sense of smell is better than theirs. Plus, I have no real leverage over any of them. They could disregard my orders if they wanted to. I'm more familiar with you, and I can trust you to follow directions. Accepting that offer was an unnecessary risk.”

As usual, Dean’s logic checked out. He was always thinking ahead, considering every angle of the situation before acting. The jerky was yet another example.

It was baffling that the Arxur captain was willing to bargain with Dean in the first place. They usually settled things with blows. Senleth’s scars were proof of that. Yet, she’d *almost* acted with honest civility.

*If she wasn't trying to eat me, that is.*

But, even with one obstacle behind us, the final goal loomed ahead. I didn't want to think about it, but our target was still out there, well-trained, armed, and dangerous.

Dean had been ready for the Arxur. Would Cole be ready for us in the same way?

“I guess we could put on some music now that my phone has service again,” Dean yawned as he flicked a finger across the device’s screen.

“A-actually…could you put *The Porcelain Rabbit* back on?” I asked my question meekly, worried what the predator might think of such a frivolous request.

“Hmm? Didn't realize you were that invested in it. Honestly, I was surprised how well it aged, but I didn't think it'd be your cup of tea.”

“I…thought it was enjoyable.”

“Fair enough. I’m willing to finish it. It's a good distraction.”

With that, he tapped the device a couple times and the narrator’s voice returned to tell its tale. Likewise, the bike hummed down the road with renewed vigor as we resumed the hunt for our target.

***Memory transcription subject: Nedaul, Tulsek Combat Medic for Krakotl Extermination Fleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 20th, 2136*

We’d been riding for a while, perpetual victims of the cold air’s buffeting. After a few Human ‘hours’ of zipping down the highway, the world around us gradually began to brighten as the sun returned to radiate through the cloud cover.

I readily welcomed the warmth. My fur was dense enough to combat the chill of stagnant air, but the whipping wind gradually sapped the heat from my body, causing me to huddle my legs inward to preserve some semblance of comfort.

The pervading darkness of the night had plunged us into a void, and though my snout assured me that we weren't being pursued by any wild predators, the oppressive vell of nothingness did nothing for my nerves. I was happy for the light’s return, if only to give me something to look at other than the inky black and the pavement illuminated in front of us.

Unfortunately, I didn't get the same view of Sol’s rising as I’d seen it fall below the horizon the evening before. The clouds continued to stand in the way, guarding the ball of fire behind a stalwart barrier. Still, the star refused to yield completely. There were thin streaks of golden light that punctured the hazy gray, cascading down until they landed gently amongst the upturned fields.

As the brightness returned, my eyes wandered to the gun strapped to Dean’s side. Seeing him shoot targets in the dark made a confrontation with Cole seem inevitable. And, while I was still hesitant to speak to the predator in front of me, I found myself asking my query all the same.

“Do you…think you’ll have to k-kill him?”

Dean didn’t answer right away. I could feel him slowly releasing a lengthy breath, as though the question was a weight that had settled on him. His whole body sagged slightly in my claws.

“Probably,” he replied. “I don’t think he’s going to come quietly this time.”

“H-have you k-killed someone before?”

“I have.”

*Of course…Why did I bother asking? He's a-*

“I was hoping I wouldn't have to do it again,” he interrupted my thought.

That took me off-guard. Predators were known for their conquests and displays of dominance. Reluctance to kill was not befitting of their kind. Even now, I assumed that he was resisting the urge to attack me only to follow the orders of his superiors.

Sensing my confusion, Dean continued.

“I was a soldier once too, just a peacekeeper. Ran into a few skirmishes here and there in unstable areas after the Sat Wars. I didn’t serve for long; it wasn’t for me. Once I got out, I became a prison guard. Then, I just worked my way up the ladder until the UN contacted me about Birchwood.”

He turned and pointed a singular eye at me.

“No one in their right mind *wants* to kill people. Something has to prompt a reaction like that, but sometimes it’s you or them. You just run out of options.”

*That's true. Our fleet came to Earth because we had to. The threat was too great.*

We were approaching another charging station. Dean turned his head to get a better look at the place, scanning it for any signs of the electricity being back on. Unfortunately, the windows were dark and no one was parked in the surrounding lot. We carried onward, the bike’s battery ticking down towards its inevitable depletion.

*I wonder how much longer we’ll be able to keep going.*

A sudden growl from Dean's stomach set my fur on end. The realization that I was holding onto a hungry predator caused me to tense up in preparation for the worst. But, the Human simply held out an expectant hand behind him.

“Hey, pass me a stick of jerky. That granola bar didn’t have much to it.”

The bags on my shoulders suddenly felt even heavier than before. I’d tried to forget about what I was carrying. Being reminded of the reality made me shudder, but I hesitantly slung one of the sacks around so I could reach inside. After undoing the knot at the top, I plunged a shaky paw within and retrieved one of the predator’s awful ‘snacks’.

I was more than happy to offload the horrible flesh onto Dean. The bag was sealed back up in a heartbeat and moved back around to my side.

“You couldn’t be bothered to open the damn thing for me?” the Human chuckled. “Forget it. I got it.”

Dean took the packaging in his teeth and tore it open with only one free hand. The motion looked positively savage, and I knew it was a simple preview of what was to come. My mind was rife with anxiety, sitting behind a predator as it prepared to feast on the remnants of a life lost.

*What if he loses control and decides to eat me too?*

Dean must have felt my grip tightening because he reassured me before he even took a bite.

“Relax. I know what you think about Humans, but I’m not going to eat you. It’d be weird eating something I could hold a conversation with, though you're not very talkative. And, honestly, you don’t look very appetizing.”

Was that supposed to be an assurance or an insult? The grays would eat a Tulsek without a second thought. Once again, I found myself baffled by Human behavior.

“N-nothing about you makes s-sense,” I muttered. “You eat m-meat, yet you wouldn’t eat m-me?”

“Most of our meat is lab grown these days,” Dean replied before taking a bite of the dried flesh. “Besides, eating animals and people are different.”

“Not to the g-grays. They put us in p-pens and breed us like l-livestock.”

“Yeah, I've heard of the Arxur. If it makes you feel any better, I think their raids are awful and they need to be stopped.”

*If that* is *true, I think it makes me feel worse.*

I didn't want to entertain the idea of Humans somehow being moral predators. It flew in the face of everything I'd ever known. There just *had* to be a trick. If I looked deep enough, I’d find something to expose their lies.

*Wait…if most of their meat is lab grown. What are all these fields for? I know they can eat plants, but this many?*

“You m-must be lying about lab-grown m-meat,” I accused the burly predator. “Even if you c-can eat prey food, these c-crops can’t all be for you. They must be grown for c-cattle feed.”

“Have you seen any cattle so far?”

I thought back on our travels, hoping that I would remember something that would give my theory a leg to stand on. But, amidst all the farmland we’d crossed, I hadn’t seen any penned animals at all.

“There *are* still folks raising livestock,” Dean admitted, giving me some consolation. “Some for slaughter, many for other reasons like shearing away excess wool for textiles. But, most of the meat industry jumped into the lab-grown stuff as soon as it was profitable. Saw the writing on the wall I guess. Honestly, it’s cleaner and more efficient these days from an economical standpoint.”

*Economics? Does that take priority over their natural urges?*

“Wh-what about your bloodlust?” I asked, sure that I could prove his dishonesty. “You can’t r-resist your hunting instincts.”

“My…what? Don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I wish I *didn't* have to chase Cole across the whole state right now. This is a huge pain in the ass and it’s dangerous.”

*I can’t deny that he seems reluctant. He built up the prison security so he could prevent these ‘manhunts’. Humans…They eat plants…They don't chase prey…*

*No. This* has *to be a trick. They're hiding the truth. What Dean says is impossible.*

*But, they hardly have the means to keep anything from us. This is their home. We brought the fight to them.*

“Th-then…what are these crops even for?” I blurted. “There’s no way this is all for your consumption!”

“Well, a lot of it gets shipped around the world,” Dean answered. “Not everything is grown for eating either. Some crops are grown for other properties. Don’t you grow stuff back home for things other than food?”

He wasn't wrong in his assumption. We most certainly did. Bluestalks were turned into a kind of paper that was used for traditional dining spreads. Stintleaves were boiled down to form a natural pest repellent as well. Was it so unlikely that Human farmers might do the same?

My mind was host to a turbulent maelstrom of conflicting thoughts. I couldn’t bring myself to believe Dean, but I couldn’t find any faults in his explanations either.

He was willing to acknowledge that Humans still kept cattle and that they might kill one another in conflict. Hell, he even mentioned that they still had unstable regions of their planet, all the while pushing a message of peace to the wider galaxy like some sort of cruel joke.

But…for every point against his species, he’d say something almost *comically* merciful.

They captured us alive even after we came to kill them, supposedly with no interest in turning us into cattle. Though we were chasing a murderous lunatic, Dean wished to take him alive if he could manage it. The Humans provided medical treatment for their injured prisoners. They grew meat in labs and could apparently eat plants…

“I…I wanna go home,” I muttered. “This planet isn’t right.”

Dean gave his signature flat chuckle in response.

“Welcome to Earth.”

New scents began to tickle at my snout, distinct from the wild flora around us. Peering around Dean’s body, I saw a herd of buildings fast approaching. Most of our travels had taken us across farmland, but this road went right through a small town.

As we entered, storefronts bordered both sides of the road. The parking lots were empty while everyone remained in the shelter of their homes. But, I saw and smelled the signs of previous Human activity.

Oddly enough, I felt as though the emptiness was even more eerie than the thought of the place bustling with predators.

Most of the buildings shared the functional design of the prison, barns, and convenience stores. But, up ahead was a rather stunning building. It looked old, yet well-kept over the years. Vibrantly colored windows decorated the stone siding. On the roof, a massive pointed segment stretched upwards into the sky. Atop that tapered column stood a metal cross.

“What is that?” the words fell out of my mouth.

Dean turned briefly to me, then followed my one focused eye and swiveled ears towards the building in question.

“It's a church,” he replied.

“Humans practice religion?”

“Some do. But, there are a lot of different faiths.”

*Naturally. They can't even agree on that. What would predators even worship?*

Before I could even consider asking for details, it was Dean’s turn to prod me for an answer of my own.

“Got any churches where you're from?”

“Yes. Back home we follow the goddess Kha-Taul. The scriptures say that all life comes from her breath, the very wind itself.”

“All life? Even *predators* like me?”

“P-predators are the spawn of an illness inflicted on Kha-Taul c-countless eons ago,” my stutter returned as I remembered that I was speaking to one of those very beasts. “All life is m-meant to be peaceful, but p-predators are abominations.”

“So…I'm just made of goddess germs? That's weird.”

When he put it that way, it did sound kind of odd. Did I detect a hint of mirth in his otherwise monotone voice?

As we passed by the church, I got a closer look at it. The doors were made of sturdy dark wood and tiny statuettes adorned the front stairwell. Considering how small the surrounding town was, I was impressed to see such artful construction. Whoever built it had managed to achieve both structural integrity, and brilliant architectural character.

Even by scent, there was something special about the church. Despite the lack of present rain, the stone had, at some point, absorbed the fragrance of petrichor. The wooden doors smelled aged, yet not rotten.

“The b-building is beautiful,” I admitted. “I always th-thought our church back on Aht-Ka was impressive, b-but I don’t think it compares.”

Dean turned around slightly to regard the thing a second time, only getting a short glance before he had to whip back to see the road.

“Yeah, that one's pretty nice, but there are more iconic churches on Earth. Granted, some of them are probably leveled now thanks to the bombs.”

*We bombed more buildings like that one…*

*Was there…truly no other way?*

I shook the thoughts from my head. My sudden regret was no doubt a result of the exposure to predatory taint. Being corrupted wasn’t an option. I had to keep it together for my herd.

*For Falkit…*

“You really could have crashed into some prettier-looking places, you know,” Dean chuckled, snapping me from my thoughts. “This farmland isn't really the best Earth has to offer.”

“I actually l-like the view,” I argued back. “It reminds me of home…”

“You're telling me that your home on an *alien* planet is just another Ohio? I guess I was hoping for something more interesting.”

Back when I lived there, I would have said the same thing. I didn’t think much of the fields and tree lines in those days. But, looking at the similarly sprawling land in front of me gave me the tiniest amount of comfort.

At least I’d die somewhere that felt familiar. There was no chance of me getting home now.

“Anything else interesting about your home world?” Dean queried.

“Why d-do you want to know?” I asked in return. “W-will you pass the information t-to your government for th-their invasion?”

“Look, I know you think I’m some kind of divine head cold, but is it too much to believe that maybe I’m just curious? Aliens are a new thing for us, you know.”

Met with only my silence, the Human shook his head and sighed.

“I didn’t pay much mind to the UN’s announcement. All the new aliens were scared of us. I didn't think any would try to come to Earth, so buying a few translator earpieces was all I did in response. Then, your fleet came and shot my expectations to hell, so pardon me for wanting to pay a little more attention to galactic affairs now.”

That was actually something I could relate to. I’d hardly given the Humans any real thought before the bombing. I viewed them solely as a threat to be eliminated and I barely remembered anything from the briefings. Now that I was captured, however, all that information seemed a hell of a lot more important.

*Maybe he really is just curious for personal reasons. I guess I could answer his question. At the very least, it's a good way to stay in his good graces.*

“Interesting th-things about my h-home…” I pondered Dean’s request, finding it difficult to think of anything especially notable about where I was raised.

My home on Aht-Ka wasn’t all that compelling. Our family was very involved in the church, but that was about it. The preacher’s sermons were what inspired me to leave for Nishtal and join their forces. I wanted to do more to purge Kha-Taul’s illness from the world. The predators of the galaxy needed to be destroyed so the goddess could heal.

*“Nedaul, can’t you just join the local exterminator guild? You could stay within this precinct. Nishtal is a long ways away.”*

*“She’s a devout follower of Kha-Taul. If she wants to commit her life to that role, who are we to stop her?”*

It was a good thing Falkit took me in after I joined the Nishtal forces. Back then I was a little…fanatical.

I recalled seeing the results of an Arxur raid for the first time. Falkit kept a close eye on me after that, making sure I was doing okay. It was a wake-up call to reality. Our fight was for more than just Kha-Taul or Intala.

*I'm supposed to be thinking about home. Back it up a bit, Nedaul.*

Apart from volunteering at the church, there wasn’t really much to do in our quaint little farmer’s market of a town. We raised our crops, did our chores, watched TV in our spare time, and went to church. Simple life, but safe.

The small settlement was receding behind us at this point. As I gazed out along the wide open fields towards the distant tree lines, it truly hit me just how much the two worlds resembled one another.

Aht-Ka had other more beautiful regions just like Dean claimed that Earth did. But, the farmland and tree lines held a particular charm to them, one that was reflected in the sight in front of me.

“I…c-can’t really think of anything s-special,” I admitted. “My home t-town was a lot like the one w-we just rode through. Most everyone w-went to church. Sometimes they’d p-play live music at the t-tavern on the edge of the main p-plaza.”

“Music, eh?” Dean mulled over my answer. “Guess that could be interesting, but I never had much of an ear for it. Been listening to the same stuff for ages. I’d probably have some of it playing if our cellular network wasn’t shot to shit. I never downloaded my playlist locally. Never thought I needed to.”

*Humans have music? I guess that they would. The church looked beautiful. They clearly have artistic capabilities. I wonder what else they create…*

I quickly shoved those thoughts from my head. Seeing predators in that light was a slippery slope that I couldn’t afford to slide down. Dean was still my enemy. This was just a temporary arrangement, and when he was done with me, he’d throw me back in a cell…

…or worse. He was a predator after all…

“This ride really *could* use some music though,” Dean sighed. “I was hoping Cole wouldn’t make it so damn far. It’s a hell of a long trip to make in silence.”

He flicked his finger across the device attached to the front of the bike, searching for something to fill up our lengthy travels. I peeked around him to get a better look at it, but couldn’t really  read the screen from where I sat.

Part of me hoped that he’d find nothing. Human entertainment couldn’t possibly be anything I’d want to hear. Yet, the rest of me equally craved something to pass the time other than speaking to a predator.

“Oh, I forgot about this one,” Dean muttered, hardly sounding excited about his discovery. “I loaded this on here for my nephew when he and my sister visited about a year ago. He’s getting old enough to read long stories so I downloaded a book that I read as a kid. It’s got an audiobook format packaged with it, so I guess we could listen. Not exactly what I was looking for, but beggars can’t be choosers.”

“Wh-what do Humans write about?” I asked.

“Hmm? Damn near everything. This is just a work of fiction. It’s called *The Porcelain Rabbit*.”

“R-rabbit?”

“Earth animal. Prey, since I know you’re going to ask.”

Was I really that predictable? I most certainly *was* about to ask.

“Wh-what’s it about?” my interest was suddenly piqued.

“How about I just play it? The story can speak for itself.”

With that, he tapped the screen on his device a few times and another pre-recorded Human voice began to emanate from the speakers.

&#x200B;

>The Porcelain Rabbit by Neil Leefson  
>  
>Elijah was young enough to still be called a boy, yet old enough to be granted the responsibilities of manhood. He boasted a muscular and capable build that others called upon whether it be with lusting eyes or simply a need for aid. Those that knew him knew him to be capable, and Elijah himself carried no qualms with their judgment.  
>  
>But, amongst his helpful nature, Elijah’s priorities remained first and foremost with his family. Grandma Wick, especially, was growing quite frail. And, true to her name, the embers of her life burned ever lower with each passing year. Elijah found himself bringing her supplies, helping her get where she needed to be, and comforting her when she was distressed by the illusions brought upon by age.  
>  
>Still, the unrelenting hands of time were not something he could combat. The icy grip of death eventually came for her, and there was not a thing Elijah could do. Grandma Wick wrote in her will to have many things bestowed upon him. But, one particular treasure stuck out more than the other trinkets and furnishings.  
>  
>It was a small, porcelain rabbit. And, with it, a note.  
>  
>Elijah was to take the fragile thing to a shrine, far across the mountains to the north. It was a perilous path, but he believed himself able to make the trek. Unwilling to disappoint his family, he spent no time mulling things over. Elijah gathered what supplies he could, packed the rabbit carefully into his satchel, and set out away from home, towards the towering behemoths that ate up the horizon.

The flowery language of the work caught me off-guard. My interactions with Humans had been short and to the point. Most spoke with that signature hint of hostility, and even Dean sounded indifferent at best when he addressed me.

But, the literature was presented with a softer tone, far removed from the bitterness I’d received since landing on Earth. Unlike the offhand comments of my predatory enemies, these words were designed to be enjoyed.

And, despite my better judgment, I was enjoying them indeed.

&#x200B;

>The rugged paths and well-weathered bridges proved no easy feat to traverse. Elijah, however, was capable. Each step was taken with confidence, and he wagered he could reach the shrine even sooner than anticipated.  
>  
>The uneven ground was not Elijah’s greatest threat, however.  
>  
>He could feel the weight of the creature's gaze long before he could see his pursuer. It stalked him relentlessly along the lengthy trail, using the trees to cover its approach. Elijah was wary of the contents within the bag on his back. He dared not move too quickly, fearing that the fragile rabbit within might shatter.

I was shocked by the sudden turn. Elijah was no doubt a Human, but the predator was being hunted by something more feral.

&#x200B;

>And so, when the panther leapt from the brush, Elijah reached out to meet it with his arm, allowing sharpened teeth to pierce his flesh if only to protect his grandmother’s trinket.

I had no idea what a panther was, but the description of the attack was enough to make me shiver.

&#x200B;

>He pushed back against the powerful beast, challenging its strength with his own. Behind him, the satchel jostled lightly, and the distraction caused Elijah to falter if only for a moment.  
>  
>The panther lunged for his neck, but was caught mid-motion by a sailing arrow. Elijah turned to see a portly man at the edge of the clearing, wielding a bow in hand.

I could tell that these ‘bows and arrows’ were not the kind I typically thought of. The passage seemed to be referencing some type of weapon. The new stranger had found the kill first, and I thought it befitting that predators wrote about their triumphs of strength.

Still, I listened, not that I had anything else to do.

&#x200B;

>”You’re lucky, stranger,” the man called out. “Or, perhaps you're unlucky. The beasts often avoid the men that walk along the path.”  
>  
>”To whom do I owe my thanks?” Elijah asked as the newcomer crossed over to the felled panther.  
>  
>”Peter,” came the reply.  
>  
>The portly traveler crouched down over his kill and retrieved his arrow. Then, he sat himself next to it and bowed his head.  
>  
>”Be at peace.”  
>  
>“Why do you honor that thing?” Elijah asked. “It attacked unprovoked.”  
>  
>”It is still a powerful force of nature,” Peter answered. “And these are its woods.”  
>  
>Elijah sat with the traveler and the two dressed the kill, salvaging the meat from the bone. It fell to Peter, for it was his kill and he saved Elijah with the arrow. But, the marksman was generous, so the two built a fire and shared the meal together.

At first, the description filled me with nausea. But, it soon diminished as the narrator continued to speak. The kill and consumption were portrayed as communal, and the creature’s life had been taken reluctantly.

It felt…oddly warm as the two strangers showed each other courtesy.

As the story progressed, the pair traveled together, both aiming to cross the mountains for their own reasons. Elijah continuously checked on the porcelain rabbit, happy to find that it was fully intact.

Time and time again they met challenges, many of which Elijah underestimated. Tasks that would have typically been trivial had turned troublesome with the rabbit in his satchel. He found himself being repeatedly injured in his efforts to protect the thing. But still, he progressed ever onward.

&#x200B;

>The storm came upon the pair swiftly. Hardly a moment was granted for them to find shelter. Peter pointed towards the open mouth of a cave and they made for it as the wind whipped a hail of debris around them.  
>  
>The two travelers formed a fire for warmth, and so they could dry themselves. The dim light flickered along the walls of the cave, illuminating just the surrounding area. Opposite to the cave’s entrance, the tunnel stretched back into inky black.  
>  
>”It’s a perilous journey indeed,” Peter chuckled. “Even the weather longs for our destruction, it seems.”  
>  
>”We were lucky to find this cave,” Elijah replied. “Perhaps we are being watched over.”  
>  
>A rattle from the darkness caused the pair to snap to attention. Facing deeper into the cave, their gazes were matched by gleaming green eyes.  
>  
>”You are being watched over indeed, humans” the being hissed. “Why have you come here? You have entered a hunting ground.”  
>  
>”Who’s?” Elijah asked in return.  
>  
>”Mine,” the word echoed about the solid rock walls.  
>  
>”Spirit,” Peter began. “We only meant to escape the storm outside. As soon as it ends, we shall leave.”  
>  
>”You shall not,” the voice in the darkness replied. “Nay, you have become prey, mine to enjoy.”  
>  
>”Your meal shall not come easily,” Elijah countered, removing a dagger from his satchel. “We are not the simple game that wander into this cave unprepared.”  
>  
>”Not easily, but you will fall.”  
>  
>The radiant eyes disappeared, swallowed back into the darkness. Then, in a flash of movement, the spirit lunged from the shadows, aiming for Elijah. Now illuminated by the firelight, the elongated body was fully visible. The otherworldly beast was a sea of blackened scales, twice the size of either of the men. Eight powerful legs adorned its sides, ending in sharpened claws.  
>  
>Elijah swiped at the thing with his dagger, finding purchase along the hardened body, but only managing to graze it as he was knocked away. Peter’s bow went to work, sending a pair of arrows towards the spirit. The sharpened heads punctured its body, eliciting a hiss in response.

My grip tightened around Dean’s torso. Could they defeat this creature? It seemed more threatening than a gray. Then again, the two travelers seemed more capable than any Human I’d seen thus far. Clearly, their capabilities were exaggerated.

&#x200B;

>Elijah took advantage of the window, charging forward and driving his dagger into the beast’s head. It flung him around as he held his weapon, but eventually its movement slowed. The spirit melted back into the shadow like an oily ooze, leaving the two travelers panting in the firelight while the storm raged outside.  
>  
>The spirit would never be completely destroyed, but it had been vanquished for a time. Elijah and Peter returned to the flame, exhausted. The former produced the porcelain rabbit from his satchel to inspect it. Though it was still intact, a small chip had formed on the paw.  
>  
>”Unacceptable,” Elijah muttered. “I have failed.”  
>  
>”You’ve done no such thing,” his portly partner assured him. “You waged war with a spirit. It is a wonder that it did not break. Lo, the sculpture still maintains its form. Despair not.”  
>  
>Still, Elijah was distraught. He packaged the trinket away and silently pledged to exercise more care. Blankets were packed tightly around it, sheltering it from any inevitable jostling.  
>  
>Once the storm passed, the travelers continued down the lengthy path, towards the mountains of the north.

It felt like no time had passed at all, yet when the cloud cover broke, I realized just how long I'd been engrossed with the story. The low morning sun had climbed higher than expected, now staring down at us from on high and spraying golden light across the landscape.

A sudden chime from Dean’s comms device caused us both to straighten in surprise.

Dean paused the audiobook and picked the device up from its place on the handlebars. I peered carefully around his side as he brought it level to his eyes. His lips curved upwards slightly.

“Well look at that. Cell signal is back. George just sent me a message.”

He tapped along the screen and then held the thing up to his ear. After a few moments, he began to speak heartily with his unseen counterpart. I couldn't quite hear the other voice over the whipping wind as it wasn't as loud as the audiobook. So, I only caught Dean’s half of the conversation.

“Hello? Can you hear me?...Perfect. Still tracking Cole…Yeah, yeah I know. I’ll get him. Just worried about the bike’s charge. It's getting pretty low…Yeah…Yeah I've been checking stations but power is out everywhere. Hopefully it'll be back on soon…Wait, actually? Shit.”

Dean’s tone shifted to one of concern. I felt his muscles tense slightly. On either side of us, dense patches of trees stood starkly, boxing us in as if to contribute to the uneasy atmosphere.

“Yeah, I'll be careful…Nah, nothing so far…Sure…Right…Yeah, I get it. Look, I understand, but we can’t afford to wait…Yeah…Of course…Okay, I'll leave it to you, then…Yeah…Bye.”

He took the device away from his ear and placed it back on the handlebars.

“Y-you sounded worried for a m-moment,” I stated hesitantly. “Is there a p-problem?”

“Might be, yeah,” Dean replied, his indifferent voice returning.

“Wh-what is it?”

Dean didn't get a chance to answer. The trees thinned as we rounded a shallow corner. Once more, I could make out the fields beyond the forest, as well as the highway that cut between them. Upon that highway, in the distance, a massive ship loomed, metal glistening with Sol’s rays.

It was Arxur make.

***Memory transcription subject: Nedaul, Tulsek Combat Medic for Krakotl Extermination Fleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 19th, 2136*

The hazy sky began to dim as our bike flew down the lonely stretch of highway. As if to remedy the darkening gray that loomed above, the cloud cover broke just over the horizon, allowing the vibrant orange gradient to briefly show itself. I watched the blazing sky cool like hot metal in the chilling vacuum in space, the dying embers of sunlight sinking deep into the ground.

The clouds, unfortunately, swallowed the fiery ball back up before it could make its exit.

*Anything good on this planet simply doesn't last.*

The swirl of alien fragrances that I'd taken solace in were slowly losing their novelty, falling into the wisps of my subconscious. Likewise, my brain had tuned out the white noise of our transportation, leaving us both in relative silence.

The world only got darker as the last vestiges of day were buried by the approaching night. There were no stars shining down on us as the clouds stood stalwart overhead. It was clear to both of us that we didn't have much light left to use.

I fought to keep my eyes open against the continuous roll of the bike over the pavement. Judging by Dean’s slumped posture and occasional yawning, it seemed that he shared my feelings of fatigue.

*I managed to get a little sleep in our cell after the crash, but has Dean slept at all? I don't want to be part of another crash just because he doses off while we're riding.*

“Wh-when was the last t-time you slept?” I stammered my question to the weary Human.

“Hmm? Showing concern for your captor?”

“I'm sh-showing concern for myself. P-please don't wreck this b-bike.”

He gave his usual emotionless chuckle, then a lengthy sigh.

“Haven't slept since all this bullshit started. But, if I had to guess, neither has Cole.”

*So there's actually* ***two*** *sleep-deprived Humans flying down the highway at high speeds. That fills me with* so *much confidence.*

My internal sarcasm was cut short by a sudden increase in the strength of Cole’s scent. It wasn't just the scent of the vehicle that he'd stolen; it was *his* scent, as strong as it was before the carjacking.

“Cole g-got out somewhere c-close by,” my tone suddenly shifted, causing Dean to straighten up as well. “His s-scent is thicker. It's not f-fresh, but he d-definitely spent some t-time around here.”

“I think I know why,” Dean muttered. “Look.”

I followed his piercing gaze to a small building just up ahead. Outside of it, there was a covered area with a number of devices protruding from the concrete below.

*It's a vehicle charging station.*

We gradually slowed down as we approached, rolling in beneath the covering. The lights within the building were all off and it seemed that no one was there.

Dean gradually turned his eyes to the front door. The entrance was made mostly of glass, and the majority of that glass was shattered haphazardly along the ground.

“Yeah, he's been here alright,” Dean dismounted the bike, prompting me to follow suit. “This looks like classic breaking and entering. He must've stopped at this convenience store for supplies.”

A particularly chilling wind bit at me through my fur. Shivering slightly, I bounded forward to catch up to the Human. Dean pushed through the now-compromised door and stepped inside. I followed close behind.

As I carefully maneuvered around the shattered glass that threatened to slice my paws, a thought entered my mind.

*I could cut him with these. If he lets his guard down…*

But, the more I considered the idea, the more I realized that I'd probably just be endangering myself. The shards were sharp on all sides. Dean could just as well turn them on me in an instant. Plus, if he noticed me before I got close, he had the advantage with his gun.

*If only it weren't just me. How am I supposed to overpower an armed predator on my own?*

As I entered the store, I took stock of my surroundings. Shelves ran up and down the length of the building. There weren’t many of them, but they were packed densely.

For the most part, the place seemed pristine. There might have been some things taken, but it was difficult to tell. Granted, with the growing darkness outside and the lack of internal lighting, it was hard to do a thorough inspection.

“Can’t we g-get the lights on?” I asked.

“There's no power. It's been out throughout the area since the bombing. Back at the prison, we had generators. But, most of the grid has been down and out. Damn Sat Wars have had us limping on temporary fixes for decades.”

Abandoning my attempts to inspect the contents of the shelves visually, I turned to the strongest of my senses. Sniffing the air, I was met with a new barrage of unfamiliar scents.

One in particular was quite strong. I followed my snout to a rack of sealed packages. Getting up close to it, I took in the strange aroma. It smelled salty, but with…something else.

“It's beef jerky,” Dean noticed my investigation. “Dried and salted meat.”

I jumped back from the rack as fast as I could, smashing into another shelf and causing a cascade of other packages on top of me. I scrambled out from under them, unwilling to learn what else predators presented for sale, and dashed to the corner in a panic.

*Oh, Kha-Taul…I was so close to it! Flesh! Horrid, filthy flesh!*

Dean just sighed, shook his head, and began to inspect the area behind the counter. As he did so, I gradually slowed my breathing, assuring myself that it was only a whiff. It’s not like I’d eaten the stuff. This was the Humans’ planet. I had to expect such awful things to be commonplace.

Once I’d calmed down enough, I hesitantly moved over to join him in his investigation.

“Looks like the register got smashed up,” Dean slid the drawer out to reveal only empty slots where I assumed currency once resided. “Not sure if cash is even worth much right now, but he's got no reason *not* to take it.”

He crouched down and surveyed the back of the counter itself. A small panel had been swung outward. Behind it, two empty hooks were drilled into the side of the compartment.

“Fuck,” Dean spat. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.”

“Wh-what is it?” I asked the very clearly irritated predator against my better judgment.

*Why am I talking to him when he's angry? What if he turns on me in frustration?*

Dean shot up to his full height, causing me to stumble backward and shrink against the wall. My eyes closed tight, bracing for the worst. But instead, he just walked around me and began to pace back and forth in the center of the room.

“I'm hoping I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. That compartment was for a gun. The clerk probably kept one for self-defense in the event of a robbery. But now, the cabinet is empty.”

*Oh, Kha-Taul…*

Dean turned his predatory stare on me, but I felt more urgency than hostility emanating from the visage.

“You've seen what Cole could do *without* a weapon. If he has a gun now…”

He didn't need to finish the sentence. I already knew what he was implying.

*Fuck.*

Outside, a particularly strong gust of wind bellowed, whipping the local flora about with its force. There was no light left from the sun. Night had fallen upon us at last.

Even in the inky darkness, I could just barely make out Dean’s form. He gave another yawn, causing me to shudder as I got an unwanted look at his gaping maw. His breathing was laborious, like the constant flood of oxygen to his brain was the only thing keeping him going.

The medic in me kicked in, urging me to speak before I could convince myself otherwise.

“You n-need sleep.”

His vacant eyes stayed locked on me for a moment before he shook his head.

“Cole is out there. He won't wait for us to sleep.”

*If we get back on that bike now, we're going to crash. I need to convince him to rest.*

“Actually, h-he traveled further by foot than w-we did. If anything, h-he should be *more* t-tired. He would n-need to stop somewhere.”

“This is the only chance at freedom he's getting. He won't stop until he collapses.”

Dean was clearly not convinced by my argument. If *he* still thought that continuing was an option, Cole would no doubt think the same thing. They'd both run each other into the ground at the rate they were going. I needed more justification to get Dean to sleep.

“Th-there's no light outside either,” I continued. “He w-would have to use the l-lights on the car. But, that w-would make him stand out. H-he could get stopped by another p-patrol like we saw before. I d-doubt he would take the r-risk.”

I wasn't sure if what I said was even true, but I was determined to get the exhausted predator to rest. He hadn't slept in days, having either been dealing with crash survivors or chasing Cole the entire time.

*If this beast is going to kill me, it won't be because he falls asleep behind the handlebars.*

“He’s out there with a fucking gun,” Dean growled. “We can't afford to stop.”

“We c-can't afford *not* to,” I argued. “He’s at h-his most dangerous now. We n-need to be fully rested and aware if w-we face him.”

Dean mulled it over. He still sounded perpetually winded. Though my eyes were well adjusted, I still couldn't get a great look at him through the dense night that surrounded us. But, I *could* make out the disheveled fur on his head and some clearly fatigued posture.

“Fine,” Dean conceded, much to my surprise. “We’ll sleep for a few hours, but then it's back on the road.”

My translator ran the conversion for these Human ‘hours’. What he described was hardly a full rest, but I doubted that I’d convince him to extend our break any more than that.

The Human dug into his artificial pelt and retrieved a pair of cuffs like the ones they’d put me in when I was first found in the wreckage. I put my arms out willingly, disinclined to argue if it meant that we'd get a moment’s respite.

Dean only locked the ring around one of my arms, leading me over to a nearby support pole and shackling me to it with the other half of the cuffs. Then, he strode to the other side of the room and slumped against the wall.

“Four hours,” Dean muttered as he tapped at his tiny comms device, likely setting an alarm. “Then we move again.”

He had his head tilted downward before I could reply, his eyes closed soon after. I watched his labored breathing begin to level out. Sleep had already taken him, a testament to his obvious exhaustion.

As for me, I wasn't having such luck.

First of all, having a predator sitting just across the room didn't make it easy to relax. Second, it was hard to get comfortable with my arm locked to a pole. Third, my mind was racing as it struggled to process the contents of the last few days.

Things had gone from bad to worse since coming to Earth. What was meant to be a valiant crusade had resulted in a crash landing into a prison of all things. Now I was reluctantly participating in a hunt in which our quarry was arming himself against us. All the while, we were running on the last vestiges of our energy.

*Which is why I need to sleep! Come on, Nedaul. Just relax.*

In an effort to quell the storm of worries in my mind, I let my thoughts drift back to my home on Aht-Ka, the world that I'd sought to protect from yet another predatory menace. As much as I so often enjoyed discovering unfamiliar scents, in times like these, I missed the fragrances of home the most.

*I'll probably never get to go back. I'm going to die in this awful place.*

My thoughts wandered back to our local church; the building bolstered the most stunning architecture out of anything in my hometown. My family and I would take our seats along the pews at every service. Mom and Dad had poured their life into serving the congregation, and my brother and I were set to do the same.

The preacher’s words sailed over us with passion.

*“Kha-Taul’s illness manifests in our world, the beasts that stalk and kill. It is our responsibility to treat her whenever possible, just as she aids us in avoiding the spawn of her disease when we are vulnerable.”*

Those days in the church had changed the trajectory of my life. I set my sights higher, wanting to train on Nishtal and purge the sickness from Kha-Taul so that we might live in peace forever. Mom and Dad were devout, but hesitant all the same. They didn’t want to see me dead at the claws of the grays, but they let me go regardless. I believed it was my calling to protect our world, and they couldn’t bring themselves to stop me.

What a wakeup call it was when I actually joined the Nishtal forces. Naturally, none of them were familiar with Kha-Taul or any of the faith that I’d given my life to. I felt isolated from the herd for a time until Falkit took a liking to me. She quite literally took me under her wing, helping me get my bearings in the bustling reality that I’d so naively entered.

*“Easy there, Nedaul. You need to learn to loosen up a little bit. I know you’re passionate about saving your goddess or whatever, but this is the space corps, not a church.”*

It took a while to get that through my head, but after some time had passed, I truly felt like I was a part of something greater. I saved lives out on the field, and though I witnessed many of the grays’ atrocities, I never gave up hope that we might win one day.

Then there were the Humans.

I found myself back on the ship’s deck, gazing at the viewport towards the rest of the extermination fleet. We were preparing to release our payload onto the Human city of Chicago. The bays were ready and we were maneuvering to the correct position.

I wasn’t doing much of anything at the time. My role as a combat medic wasn’t all that necessary during a bombing. We were up high above the destruction, so significant injury amongst the crew was unlikely.

Falkit sat next to me, her body rife with uncharacteristic tension.

*“Something doesn’t feel right about this.”*

*“What do you mean?”*

*“These predators aren’t quite like the Arxur. I don’t know, I just have a bad feeling.”*

*“Take a page from your own book and loosen up. We’ll be in and out in no time. One less sapient predator to worry about, and we can go back to focusing on the grays.”*

Falkit gave me a look of acknowledgement, but it was wiped from her visage as a sudden impact flung us from our seats. Warning sirens blared out over the deck. I scrambled to check those around me for wounds. But, I didn't even get to stand up to my full height before another impact rattled us again. Then another.

The lights went down. The dampeners were failing. I could feel the craft drifting downward, suddenly taken by the planet’s gravity. As we fell, the captain’s voice sounded out over the intercom, urging us to brace for a rough landing.

*“Falkit!”*

I received no answer.

We were leveling out, but still going far too fast. The ship was too big to land softly. I could smell burning all around me, and as we hit the ground I felt the whole thing buckle.

The ship rattled as we skidded along the planet’s surface. I could barely see out of the viewport with all the shaking, but I did manage to see a building growing larger up ahead. I grabbed whatever my paws could grip soundly and prayed to Kha-Taul that her breath would guide me to the blossoming fields as I met my inevitable end.

But, somehow, I survived. Flung about the wreckage, my body rolled in such a way that I received nothing more than a few bruises. I got my bearings as fast as I could, running around haphazardly to try and save my comrades’ lives.

Most were already corpses by the time I discovered them in the forest of mangled metal.

*Falkit…please be okay.*

My vision was blurred. It felt like the wreckage was twisting and turning, forming a maze of shredded metal around me. Every direction I ran seemed to be the wrong one.

Suddenly, I was once more crouched beside the violet Krakotl as it bled out on the ground. My claw shot hastily towards my medical kit, retrieving the necessary supplies. I went to work immediately. First priority was stopping the bleeding. His left wing had been punctured. There was a massive hole in the flesh. Far too large…

I began to stitch the opening together as best I could, weaving the thing shut with speed that rivaled a Zurulian’s. The world seemed to swirl into a whirlwind around me, clearly a product of my fear. But, I couldn't lose my senses just yet. Lives were on the line.

This Krakotl’s life, in particular, was fading fast. His feathers acquired an even deeper hue from the blood that flowed from his wound. The same blood seemed to be seeping from places on his body that weren’t even damaged. Some of the violet liquid flowed from his eyes like tears. It even oozed up from the ground below us.

*So much blood. So much blood.*

The Krakotl’s breath started to become a gargle. There was fluid in his lungs, internal bleeding.

*Just another corpse. Just another corpse.*

I knew in my heart that my efforts were in vain. The bleeding from his wing was stemmed, but the bird’s breathing was getting even more obstructed. He hacked up a spray of blood. Some of it splattered against my coat but I’d lost the capacity to care.

*Come on…Please…We shouldn’t be here…*

Despite my attempts, the Krakotl’s eyes began to go glassy and his breathing diminished until it was nothing but a few ragged gasps. I was too late. The dying pulse and the vivid stains on the concrete below told me that I had failed. He went fully limp, another corpse in the wreckage.

*Why…are we here?*

I detected the familiar scent before the orange flash entered my field of vision. My head whipped to the side to see Cole. He wore a manic snarl, eyes burrowing into my very soul.

My claw flew towards my gun, but the holster was empty. Instead, the weapon was in Cole’s hand. He leveled it at me, continuing to stare me down with his predatory visage. The beast wouldn't miss his shot, not like I had.

Dean stood a short distance away. His own pistol was at his side, but he stood motionless. The monster, Cole Clifton, was right there, but Dean showed no desire to bring him down.

Instead, he just looked at me with that same blank expression.

I tried to run, but the violet Krakotl’s corpse suddenly came to life. The bloodied bird grabbed onto my leg with his stitched up wing. Despite the injury, the grip was firm and I couldn’t break free. His corpse twisted and warped until it took on Falkit’s form. Blood streamed from her eyes and beak like waterfalls. The color shifted from violet to pitch black.

*No, Falkit! I don’t want to die! I don’t-!*

The gunshot rang out through the wreckage. Searing pain shot through my abdomen.

\-

*I’m hit! I need cover!*

I dove from my place on the floor, aiming to land behind a nearby shelf. But, the cuffs only dug into my arm as they clung firmly to the pole. I yelped as the metal tore at me, yanking me back to where I’d started. I quickly pulled my free limbs inward to make myself a smaller target as I waited for my inevitable demise, surrounded by the oppressive darkness.

*I can’t move! The gun! I'm dead! I’m-!*

I took a look around, finally remembering where I was.

*It was just a nightmare. I'm still in the convenience store.*

I didn't have much time to process the reality of my situation before another, very real gunshot cracked from outside the building. I once more bundled myself together, trying to avoid any incoming rounds.

*These fucking cuffs-! Who’s shooting? Did Cole find us first? No, that doesn't make sense. Dean would be firing back. There's only been one shot at a time.*

Slowly, I uncurled from my ball and began to slide my cuffs up the length of the pole, standing so I could see over the shelves.

Outside, I could just make out Dean in the darkness, holding his pistol forward. A short distance away, he'd set a few of the packaged goods from the store up against a mound of dirt. It was just target practice.

He took a few more shots, emptying the ammunition into the foodstuffs with precision. Then, he exchanged the magazine, holstered the weapon, and turned to walk back inside. His massive form looked ominous in the inky shadows of the sunless sky. I shuddered as I regarded his menacing silhouette.

“About time you woke up,” he muttered.

“H-hard to stay asleep with g-gunshots outside.”

“Well, you didn't wake up when the alarm went off, and with the way you were thrashing around in your sleep, touching you seemed like a bad idea. I’d rather not get swiped by those claws.”

“W-well, I'm awake now. C-could you take off these c-cuffs?”

Dean obliged, removing a key from one of the pockets of his artificial pelt and inserting it into the hardy shackles. I rubbed my wrist where they'd chafed my flesh, a fault of my own really.

“There's a couple restrooms over there,” Dean pointed to a pair of marked doors. “There’s still no power, but it seems that the water is still on. Figured you might want to wash up right quick before we head out. I wouldn’t drink it though. Treatment plants will be limping along if they’re running at all, and there’s drinkable water out here anyway.”

“Wh-what do the different symbols on the doors mean?”

“They’re for gender. Left one is female. Right is male.”

Making my way over to the door on the left, I regarded the marking that adorned it. It seemed to be a Human, but the body was a triangle that tapered off at the top.

*Weird. I thought Human female torsos were larger in the chest. This one looks backwards. I really should have focused more during that briefing.*

Entering the room, I was met with a toilet that looked a little nicer than the one in the prison, though that was kind of a low bar. It still barely accommodated my anatomy, boasting a tank on the back of it that didn’t leave much room for my tail. Trying to face backwards was equally awkward due to the shape of the seat.

*Stupid tailless primates…Kha-Taul forbid they have normal fucking bodies.*

It was still better than stopping on the side of the road. We'd already taken a break once during our pursuit, making use of a wooded area. The privacy there left a little to be desired. A pawful of relatively thin trees wasn’t exactly great cover.

Once I’d handled my necessary business, I took a moment to look at myself in the mirror. It was hard to make out any details given the lack of light, but I could tell that my fur was pretty disheveled. Spending the time to fully fix it seemed pointless since it’d just get whipped around by the wind again as soon as we got back on the bike. Instead, I just lightly ran my claws over my face a few times, trying to straighten it out a little.

The tracker around my neck had my coat pressed down firmly. Luckily, the fur acted as a buffer between the device and my skin. If I had bare hide like the Humans did, my neck would have been rubbed raw by this point.

*I bet this collar would usually be for a real bloodhound.*

I stared at my abdomen, where the round had hit me in my dream. It still felt tender, even though the wound wasn’t real.

*That nightmare was…wrong. The crash didn’t happen that way, but it still felt real. Fuck, I just wanna be done with this shit.*

I splashed some water over my face and exited the restroom. Dean was already back outside, giving the bike a quick inspection. I made sure to avoid the shattered glass from the broken door as I went to join him.

Stepping out of the building, the chilling wind hit me squarely. While my fur did well to insulate me, I could tell that it was nearing its limits in the absence of the warming sunlight. Dean had donned a pair of small pelts that covered his hands, and he wore another that covered the gray strands atop his head as well as his ears.

“So…a lady, eh?” he asked once he noticed my approach. “Kind of expected you to use the other one.”

“You th-thought I was male?”

“Well, it's not like I've ever seen a Tulsek before. I don't exactly know how to tell the difference.”

Admittedly, there weren't a lot of differences. Male and female Tulseks looked fairly similar. I couldn’t really fault him for his ignorance.

*At least I know now that he kept his wretched predator eyes to himself when we stopped back in the woods.*

“F-females have slightly thinner s-snouts and smaller p-paws.”

“I'll keep that in mind if another spaceship crashes into my prison. Here, take this.”

Dean held out a package toward me. I hesitantly took it from his hand, though the text printed across the front wasn’t something the translator recognized. The word ‘granola’ seemed to throw it for a loop.

“Wh-what is it?”

“Food. It's a granola bar. No meat, if you were wondering. It’s all plant-based.”

*No meat? Why would they even sell something like this?*

“Wh-why does the store c-carry prey food?”

“You know we can eat plants, right?”

I most certainly *did not* know that. Did they mention that in the briefing? I *really* should have paid more attention.

*So these fields aren’t just for cattle feed after all…*

“Look,” Dean sighed. We need to get a move on. Just take the damn granola bar.”

I didn’t want to accept food from a predator, but the void in my stomach overpowered my reluctance. It had been some time since I'd had anything to eat at all.

Slowly, I unwrapped the package and bit down into the crunchy snack. It wasn't bad. Nothing special, but better than I expected from predators. It smelled surprisingly sweet.

“Go ahead and grab those bags while you’re at it,” Dean motioned towards several flimsy plastic sacks on the ground. “We’ll be taking them with us.”

I bundled the sacks together in my paws and hoisted them all up at once. They weren’t that heavy individually, but with how many of them there were, it took a little bit of effort to lift them. Each one was packed completely, tied at the top to prevent anything from falling out.

“Wh-what’s in these?” I asked.

“Beef jerky.”

I flung the sacks away haphazardly. This fucking Human wanted me to carry bags full of meat?!

*Kha-Taul, how many more tortures must I endure?*

“Wh-why are w-we taking *that*?!” I stammered.

“Relax. I took a count. We’ll reimburse the owner later.”

“N-no, I mean wh-why are we t-taking *meat*? And s-so m-much of it…”

Dean leveled his indifferent stare at me. I felt his piercing gaze burrow into my soul.

“Why else?”

I shuddered in response.

*Of course it’s for eating. I don’t even know why I asked. But…there’s so much of it. His hunger must be tremendous. Oh, Kha-Taul...*

The Human motioned towards the scattered bags again, clearly unwilling to change his mind. Reluctantly, I began to pick them back up, nausea clouding my senses. I could still smell the salt, but suddenly the other repulsive odors seemed much stronger.

I retched a couple times, but managed to keep my meager granola bar down. After a moment of stabilizing myself, I was able to push the knowledge of the bag’s contents to the back of my mind. Dean wasn’t going to wait all day for me, and I feared what he might do if I didn’t comply.

*Kha-Taul, please have mercy on me. I’m not sure how much more of this I can take.*

Dean was already on the bike, waiting for me to join him. As I slid onto the back of the seat, he heaved a sigh.

“I was hoping that we’d be able to use the charging stations here, but the electricity is still out. The bike still has about a quarter charge left in it, but it’s dwindling. At some point, we’ll need to figure out how to charge it.”

“W-we’re just going to keep g-going until it runs out?”

“What other choice do we have? Cole is getting further away. The worst we can do is strand ourselves until someone can come pick us up or provide us power. If we’re lucky, we’ll find a way to charge it as we go.”

I couldn’t find any real faults in Dean’s reasoning. If the power was out, it’s not like we could just wait here for it to come back on. The only way to go was forward. Hopefully, we’d come across a solution before we got stuck.

So, onward we went. I pushed my arms through the handles of the bags, letting them rest on my shoulders for the sake of convenience. Dean powered the bike back on, and we pulled away from the store, back onto the road and after the escaped convict’s scent.

I tried not to think about the gun that Cole had no doubt acquired.

""Twenty-three hundred or so,"" she said. I nodded and glanced over at Gary.

""You're the expert,"" I told him. ""What do you think?""

He rubbed his beard thoughtfully for a minute. ""Tell me about what kind of critter they are again?"" he asked, looking at Inanna.

""They're Lares. They're the offspring of devas and mortal humans from the spirit world, and normally, they live in a sort of clan structure, where each clan is about four or five families with a defined territory. They see themselves as guardians of their territory, and the whole thing is a bit like a racket run by an honest gang. If you live in their territory, they expect you to make regular donations, and if you don't, they'll take what they want. Either way, they'll actually defend you if you're attacked by someone from outside the territory, though they don't care about infighting within territories. Not their business.""

""Huh,"" Gary said.

""Don't put too much faith in that,"" Inanna said. ""Arkanthros did *something* to bring this many clans together. This is decidedly not traditional, so I wouldn't expect them to continue to behave in the traditional way.""

""Any kind of magical abilities?""

""Aside from having four arms, they can regenerate -though not as fast as a demigod- and use some simple battle magic, like small fireballs, lightning bolts and energy shields. They've got great small unit tactics, but no real experience fighting en masse.""

Gary nodded. Then he went back to ruminating. A few moments later, he shrugged.

""Honest to god, I don't reckon there's really all that much to it. There's too many for us to handle in a straight up fight. We need to figure out a way to stop 'em from getting through the portal, or at least figure out where the portal's gonna open up.""

""I mean,"" I added. ""This is Arkanthros we're talking about. He's almost certainly going after Nick or Kathy, right? They're the ones who've embarrassed him multiple times.""

""No, he's going after the people they care about,"" Inanna said, and I raised a hand to concede the point. That was much more Arkanthros' style.

""So shutting down the portal, keeping them away from it or, or setting an ambush on earth are our only real options,"" I mused.

Gary nodded. ""That's about the long and short of it, yup.""

""The ambush is not gonna happen. It would take too long and cost too much political capital to accomplish. I say we send Jerry after Pissface and the rest of us look into shutting down that portal,"" Inanna said.

""Hmmm,"" I said. ""That could work. If I destroy his body quick enough, I could get back to assist you guys. Wait...""

Everybody looked at me. Gary, Angie, Inanna, Babs and Liam; a big Samoan guy with the improbable last name of MacReady. He was kinda new, having only started last year. He was the adopted father of a girl who'd been at the center of a case Gary handled shortly before we hired him, and him taking on work as a security trooper had been a part of the process of getting the adoption working. Prior to that, he'd been involved with an outlaw motorcycle club.

""What if I took him down right where the whole army could see?""

Inanna shrugged. ""They're not really the led-by-the-strongest type. I mean, watching the guy that organized them get smacked down and then used as a urinal -and I swear to all the gods, Jerry, if you don't maintain the tradition, I'll be legitimately mad about it- is obviously going to disorganize them quite a bit and leave them wondering, but it's probably not going to send them into total disarray. My suggestion was more about getting Pissface out of the way so we can deal with the army in peace. Well, relative peace.""

I nodded, understanding her point. One of the Huorns bent over to stroke Inanna's hair with a branch, and she smiled, rubbing the branch with her hand in response.

It had been the Huorns themselves that had brought us here. The army over the rise needed firewood and planks to shore up the muddy field on which they had made camp. Naturally, they had cut down many of the trees of the forest in which we now planned. Unfortunately, some of those trees they had cut down were Huorns; living, conscious tree-shapes spirits who had a connection to Ishantee. She became aware of the pain of the felled Huorns and the grief of those around them and called us. When we came to investigate, we'd found the army and Arkanthros organizing them with the help of a handful of imps.

They were more animal than intelligent being, but according to Inanna, they were remarkably smart and social creatures. Like elephants, she had said. They certainly seemed to recognize that we were here to help, and had been affectionately petting us at every opportunity. Inanna and Babs didn't mind it, but the rest of us were frequently startled by it.

Angie looked over her shoulder, at the hill that protected us from the army's view. ""Does anyone else think this is a little too straightforward?"" I raised an eyebrow at her.

""I mean, the guy's a demon, right? A former god, with thousands of years of experience. I feel like this whole thing has been a little too convenient, you know? They just start indiscriminately cutting down the one forest that would get our attention, then set up a camp which has a couple of good vantage points around it they're not guarding, and start making a giant portal right out in the open where anyone can see it to march through. It all just seems a little too easy.""

""Kathy probably knows him the best, but I know he's not the brightest bulb,"" Gary said.

""What was he the god of again?"" I asked, turning to Inanna.

""Flowers,"" she said. I blinked rapidly in surprise, but she just shrugged. ""Flowers were really important to people back then. It was really more about floral arrangements, but yeah. He was the god of flowers.""

I stifled a laugh. So did Gary. And Angie and Babs. Liam didn't, though, he just let out a deep belly laugh, then clapped his hands over his mouth.

""Sorry,"" he said.

""I don't think they heard you. The guard's route is like, three hundred yards away,"" Inanna said.

""Okay then. You guys get in there, disrupt the ritual before they open that portal, and I'll go take care of Arkanthros,"" I said.

""And if they just resume the ritual?"" Babs asked.

""See what you can do about salting the ground. Honestly, I think without Arkanthros, they're not going to be motivated to continue. Whatever he's promised them will die with him.""

""Remember, Jerry,"" Inanna said. ""The tradition.""

I sighed. ""Yes dear, I'll be sure to piss on his face once he's down.""

\----

I flew, invisible, above the camp, crossing it to get to the large tent where we had spotted Arkanthros. Once there, I settled down gently, using a hint of magic to suppress any sound I made as I slipped inside.

The main space of the tent was a charnel house. Bodies of humans and humanoid spirits were strewn around, and the place was full of the stink of blood, feces and urine. Most of the victims had obviously been tortured to death. One anorexic figure had her hands pinned to one of the posts by a thick, metal spike driven through both palms. She was missing strips of skin from her armpits and inner thighs, both feet had been cut off, and long needles were protruding from all over her body, especially the more sensitive areas. A large wooden phallus smeared with blood and fecal matter lay between her legs.

I suppressed the urge to growl out loud and turned away from the gruesome sight, only to see a young man with deer-like horns and long, pointed ears, who had been split down the middle from groin to neck after being hung from an overhead beam with a hook that passed through both wrists. His intestines lay in a pile beneath his feet, and his penis had been severed and stuffed into his mouth.

I closed my eyes, as there was nowhere I could look without seeing such horrors. I reminded myself that I was here to stop any more such deaths from happening. It didn't help much, but when I thought that I was avenging those who'd already suffered, my raging emotions smoothed over a bit.

I took several steadying breaths, and then opened my eyes. Everything was still there, but now I saw defiled corpses, and not the horrors that they had suffered in their final days.

Partitions marked off the rear of the tent, and it was to those that I moved.

I used a bit of illusion magic to hide the movement as I slipped through the flaps used as doorways. In the first room, I found a pair of imps having sex with a headless corpse. My lip curled in disgust, but exposing myself right now wasn't ideal, so I kept moving.

I moved through another flap and found him. He was lounging in a big pile of pillows, a whole bunch of female imps draped across him. More savaged bodies were scattered about, mostly of small, black-furred humanoids with goat-like heads. The room stank of blood and sex and excrement.

I seriously considered using Godslayer for a moment. My reticence to do so wasn't born out of any sympathy for Arkanthros, but out of the simple fact that the magical side effects of destroying this foul creature right now might endanger the others' efforts. The thrum tended to be quite audible.

Instead, I reached for my staff in hammerspace. I planned to fill this space with what I had been calling a black web; a mass of black fibers so incredibly sticky as to immediately bind everything into immobility. The web also tended to absorb sounds. The two imps in the next room would be the only ones who might hear the reaction of the inhabitants of this room, and I could handle them by simply yanking them in the moment they appeared. I was immune to the effects of the black web. As the caster, the magical stickiness simply wouldn't affect me.

I raised my staff and summoned the magic, but before I could release it, I felt a wet blanket settle down.

Arkanthros sprang up as three of his imps threw themselves at me.

Cursing at having stepped into what was now obviously a trap, I hit one imp in the face with an elbow. Another tackled me around the waist, her horny head slamming into my groin with a burst of masculine pain, making me stumble. Before I could catch my balance, the third wrapped herself around my legs.

I fell, the first imp already recovering. She rushed me and grabbed an arm as the one who'd headbutted my crotch grabbed the other. I was stronger than the imps, individually, but they had the advantage of numbers, and they seemed to know what they were doing. They managed to get my arms wrestled behind my back. With the help of their friend, they got me pushed down to the floor.

Arkanthros towered over us, grinning down at me. Male Asuras generally keep their genitals inside their body, able to pop them out at will. The lives of violence they led kind of necessitated that sort of concession. Of course, Arkanthros' package was on full display, and with me crouched down on my calves, it was just above face level. I couldn't help but curl my lips up in discuss as the feces-and-bodily-fluid-stained member dangled in front of me.

""Well,"" he crowed, ""That went exactly according to plan.""

I didn't say anything. I just worked to block out my sense of smell as I felt out the weaknesses in the wet blanket. Every magic-user made theirs a little different, and everyone had weaknesses. Except for Kathy and I, but that was only to the extent of my knowledge. I'm sure there was *some* weakness, but I hadn't found it yet. In this case, the blanket was very much a weave of magic, through which there were countless tiny holes. Slipping magic through those holes would take a long while, but I began doing it. I used time and meta-magic, thinking that might be the most useful, as the blanket itself seemed to be attracted to human magic.

Arkanthros turned to the two imps who had not attacked me.

""Go, check on the others. Aid the Lares if they have not captured them yet."" Both inclined their Darth-Maul-like heads (only instead of black and red skin, they had brown and reddish-brown scales) and slipped out of the flaps as the imps holding me slipped a collar around my neck.

It was an older-model Group collar, or rather, a knock-off of such. I let go of the magic I had been pushing out of the wet blanket and let the collar cut off my connection to the outside world. Sure enough, the skin of the clawed hands the imps were restraining me with spiked in temperature as the wet blanket receded.

I began to work magic inside of myself.

""You and yours continue to underestimate me, foolish mortal,"" he said to me. He stepped forward, brushing my face with his disgusting thing. I flinched away and looked up at him, my lip curling even more.

""Well,"" I said mildly. ""My days of not taking you seriously are certainly coming to a middle.""

\----

I had to hand it to Arkanthros, he had actually designed a quite clever trap. The wet blankets he had empowered and prepared for us weren't perfect, but they were good enough to render our magic useless long enough for his men to overpower us. Everyone but Gary ended up being captured.

They were marched in front of Arkanthros, all wearing collars just like mine (which afforded me a better look at them, I might add). He gloated for a moment, then commanded that we be secured until 'the moment of his victory', whatever that was.

We found ourselves stuffed into wooden cages. There were a few innocent beings in them already. A woman with bright pink hair (ahem, it was obviously her natural color, too, thanks to her nudity) who didn't speak any language I knew, two of the black-furred, goat-headed creatures who had that almost-ubiquitous ability to speak whatever language they were being spoken to it, and a trio of deer-antlered young men, who didn't speak at all.

We learned from the goat-men -fauns, actually, as they self-identified- that Arkanthros had been working on uniting the various clans of Lares for several years now. His promise had been one of new territories on earth, and though there were many holdouts, he'd assembled a good chunk of them.

He'd had them raiding surrounding communities, training to work together. That's where all the slaves had come from. The two fauns, Jomar and (you're not going to believe this, but I swear to god it's true) Billy, had been part of a group of eleven taken from one such village. They had been here for a month, being fed scraps and dirty water, watching their friends and family get taken one, out by one, and brought into Arkanthros' tent.

As can be expected, all six of the captives in with us were heavily traumatized. The pink-haired woman, especially, showed signs of having been horribly abused, in the form of bruises and lacerations all over her body. At Inanna's insistence, I'd let my aura blaze away, so that I could get close enough to examine her.

As Inanna, Angie and all three of the seemingly-mute deer-men bit their knuckles and eyed me like a piece of meat, I checked the woman out. With my aura burning away, she contented herself with staring wide-eyed at me as I worked, while chattering under her breath in whatever language she spoke.

And before you get any weird ideas, remember that the aura is a result of Inanna's domains. Plural. The poor woman had been abused to hell and back. I wasn't making her horny, but filling her with the warmth and comfort of being with a loved one. That's why it can have such a potent effect on people; it doesn't just make them libidinous for me, it makes them feel an unnatural affection for me.

In this case, the poor thing didn't have an ounce of libido left, so all she got was the affectionate side of things. Which worked. When I was done, she left her corner of the cage and came over to sit with the rest of us.

""She's in pretty rough shape,"" I said. ""The fauns are both doing pretty well. Those three seem uninjured, if malnourished. I suspect they've been having trouble with the slop they're being fed."" One corner of the cages contained a watery puddle of excrement, and the smell was pretty potent.

""Fauns can digest damn near anything,"" Inanna said. ""They might even have been eating some of the mud. Plus, we can communicate with those two, so they might be able to help.""

I leaned forward, causing the others to lean in as well.

""I can break my collar,"" I whispered.

""How?"" Angie asked.

""They're rip-offs of the old Mark One Group collars,"" I hissed. ""They're much less effective against internal magic. Angie, you should be able to break yours too, but it'll take a big, and be choking you the whole time.""

She frowned, experimenting. I saw the veins along her arms pop and the muscles grow slightly more defined, then she relaxed and let out a breath.

""Yeah,"" she said. ""It's taking a lot of effort, but I can get big. I'm pretty sure I can pop this thing off before it chokes me out.""

""How long will it take you to remove someone else's?"" Inanna whispered.

I shrugged. ""A couple of minutes, actually. I'm not attuned to them, though I suspect I can do the second faster than the first.""

Liam ran a finger inside his own collar. ""This thing really don't make no difference to me. It's not gonna explode if I piss them off, is it?""

I shook my head slightly. ""They just suppress magic. And you're right. Angie and I can pop free quickly. That'll get us some magic into play, plus Angie's strength. Inanna, baby, you're perfectly capable of fighting without magic, and Liam, you can't tell the difference.""

""So when do we do this?"" Billy the faun asked.

""Hmmm."" Coordinating with Gary would be ideal, since he'd gotten free. But the collars prevented me from contacting him magically, until I got it off. And there was no way they wouldn't know the instant I did that.

Which meant I had to guess when Gary would launch a rescue attempt. Given his experience and determination, I had no doubt that would happen. But when?

""Trying to figure out when Gary's going to make his move?"" Inanna asked. I nodded.

""Me and him had a long conversation the other day. About magic and its preference for narrative structures,"" she said. I quirked an eyebrow.

""How was he taking it?""

""He was basically taking mental notes and calling out moments that seemed to prove me right,"" she said.

""So then, right as Arkanthros is having his moment,"" I said. She nodded, tapping her temple.

""Enough plotting!"" one of the female imps shouted, giving the cage a smack with her fist. ""Break it up!""

We scattered, and I noticed her eyes following Liam. She grinned as he settled down against the bars, across from her, then licked her lips as she turned away.

I took note that she had a fancy for the big guy. Not that there was much we could do with that, but it was worth remembering, in case it came in handy. I sat next to Liam.

""Can you tell the imps apart?"" I asked.

""Which ones are they?"" he whispered back.

""The brown, scaly, Darth Maul women with the huge breasts.""

""Oh, yeah! Man, I ain't never seen nipples like that. They're as big as my thumb!""

I tried to remind myself that my familiarity with the idiosyncrasies of non-human physiology had taken a long time to come about. Liam was still getting used to the weird.

""Yeah, them. Can you tell them apart?""

He peered at the one walking away, then looked over to where two more females and one male imp were talking.

""Uh, I can tell the boys and girls apart, for sure.""

""That one,"" I said, pointing at the one walking away. ""She's sweet on you.""

Liam slowly turned his head to face me. ""Aua e te taalo solo, uso,"" he deadpanned. I chuckled.

""I'm not saying she's sweet. She's likely a sadistic harpy who would likely prefer to get off on sexually torturing you to death over making sweet love to you, but I saw the way she was looking at you. She's attracted to you.""

""Bro, why the fuck are you telling me this?""

""Because, when we make a break for it, you can use that to your advantage,"" I said. ""Just smile at her. Make a sexual comment, something aggressive, preferably. She'll hesitate.""

""Oh. Shit, yeah, okay. I think I can tell her apart from the others. She's got longer horns above her ears, and her tits aren't ridiculously big, just kinda... Humongous.""

I nodded. ""Yeah, that's her.""

We both watched her go for a bit. I waited for Liam to comment on her behind, which was really quite shapely, but he never said a word. When she moved out of view, I turned to him.

""Demons not really your type?"" I asked.

""Nah, brother. I used to chase tail all over the place, but I only have eyes for one special lady these days.""

He gave me a double take as he said it, realizing he might have let something slip. I chuckled, because I already knew what it was. They could tell the rest of us in due time, however. I wouldn't burst his bubble today.

\----

A few hours later, the imps came and fetched us out of the cages. All of us, including the pink-haired woman who seemed to want to stick close to me. I gave her an arm to lean on, as she was limping the whole way through the camp.

I realized what was happening before we got there. I could see the portal, shimmering in the air. I couldn't see what was on the other side, but the fact that they'd gotten it going was obvious. The imps led us to a spot near where Arkanthros stood, hands on his hips, overseeing the march of his army through the portal with a barbed erection. I curled my lip again. Even by Asura standards, he was classless.

The imps tied us off to stakes in the ground, looping the rope through our collars. In the case of the other captives, it went around their necks in a tight noose. Once we'd been secured, the imps stepped away and Arkanthros turned.

""Behold, as my army marches across to your world, mortal!"" he crowed. I rolled my eyes.

""Over two thousand blooded warriors, each one a veteran of countless fights, armed with shield and spear and sword, clad in magical armor and filled with a glorious bloodlust! I have seen your own warriors fight. Pathetic worms, all of them. They cower behind trees and rocks and fire their weapons aimlessly, hoping the fear of a glorious death will be enough to break their enemy's spirits. They will be crushed, ground under the heels of my Lares! And when they are done with your warriors, they will plunder and pillage to their hearts content among your cities. Their ears will be filled with the wails of of orphaned children and the cries of wives and daughters being sodomized at the pleasure of my troops. And those who catch my eye will be brought to me, personally.""

He bent over to come face to face with me, Inanna on one side and the pink-haired woman on the other. She shrank back from him while Inanna and eyes merely met his gaze.

""When the last of my troops are through, I will rape your wife and your new friend to death in front of you,"" he rumbled menacingly.

""Quick question,"" I said. He recoiled in surprise. Probably at my tone, which was kinda bored, to be honest.

""Do you really plan to conquer the entire planet with two thousand three hundred medieval troops? I mean, I know they can throw some magic around, and the four arms are kinda useful, but what, exactly, do you think they're going to do against a drone? What about an infantry fighting vehicle? I mean, did they even train to fight against paratroopers?""

Arkanthros growled at me, which was a pretty clear answer. Inanna tittered.

""Foolish mortal. Do you think I do not know what your people are capable of? I have chosen my beachhead to be your vault, in the ancient mountains on the east side of Turtle Island. We will seize the weapons you store, free the prisoners you hold, and turn them both against you.""

I parsed that for a second. We didn't have a vaul-

Oh.

Oh my.

I choked back a laugh.

Arkanthros growled,and I couldn't help it. I laughed, just once before I got control of myself. When I spoke, my voice was high-pitched and cracking.

""Are you telling me... That you send your army to the Clarke County Detention Facility?""

""Your vault!"" he snapped. ""In the misty mountains!""

""That's the one!"" Inanna said, barely holding back her own laughter. Liam and Angie glanced back and forth, unsure of what was so funny. Because of course they were. They didn't work at the CCDF, and we kept info on the site pretty wrapped up.

""So what I'm hearing is..."" I paused to let a chuckle slip, then caught my breath. ""You just sent your whole army to a place that's built like a fortress, in the middle of a sparsely-populated area, which was specifically built to contain supernatural threats, and is staffed by six hundred of the fighters who are the best trained and equipped *in the world* to defend against your army.""

Inanna burst into laughter.

Angie and Liam began to catch on as grins spread across their features. At the same moment, a mass of six Lares burst back through the gate. All were bloody, most were limping and stumbling, and three of them dropped before they could get anywhere. A second later, two more came running through. Then five. Then a group of about a dozen. All kept running, slipping out of the camp and dispersing in the surrounding woods.

The trickle turned into a flood. Cries of fear and pain began to drift from the dispersing mass of Lares.

I finally got a grip on myself, and forced a mix of meta-magic and chaotic knowledge magic into the collar. It burst into flames, singing my neck, but quickly crumbling to ash and falling to the ground. I summoned my staff from Arkanthros' tent, and while it was coming, I produced Godslayer.

Arkanthros had been distracted by the retreat through the portal, and had his back turned to me, but one of the imps screamed in terror when my collar fell off, and he turned.

""I think this is gonna be the last time we put up with your nonsense,"" I said. but before I could cut him down, his head exploded with a meaty smack. A split-second later, I heard a distant crack. Arkanthros' body collapsed, lifeless to the ground.

""Damn,"" I said. Now I'd have to wait for the next time I stumbled across him. I was honestly kinda looking forward to pissing on his face.

""I *told* you this was when he'd be ready!"" Inanna crowed. I turned around to see Angie's face had turned completely purple, and she was slowly growing. The collar broke with a snap and suddenly, she finished expanding in a heartbeat. She turned towards the imps and began to stalk forward.

Liam grabbed the rope holding him to the stake and broke it like it was nothing.

""Should I do the thing now, boss?"" he asked. I looked at the imps, running in terror from Angie as she gave chase and shrugged.

""Seems it wasn't necessary,"" I said.

""Good,"" he replied. ""I don't like the idea of even pretending to want to fuck one of those things.""

*I'm on my way down,* Gary's voice sounded in my head. *As soon as I'm there, we can head through and try to stop them from whatever they're up to on the other side.*

*No need,* I sent back. *Arkanthros outsmarted himself, this time. He sent them to Clarke County, to 'raid' our vaults for weapons and allies.*

*HAH!* Gary shot back, making me wince with the mental volume. *Of all the horseshit stupid places to attack...*

I turned and busied myself getting Inanna's collar off. By the time I was done, the portal had winked out and Gary and Angie had returned, the latter splattered in blood. Gary went ahead and relieved himself on what was left of Arkanthros' head.

""Four hundred,"" Jomar said when I finally got the collar off. I turned to him as Gary was zipping up.

""Eh?"" I asked.

""Four hundred of the Lares came back through,"" he said. ""And that includes the fifty or so laying there, dead.""

I looked down, and sure enough, there were about fifty dead Lares laying in front of the portal.

""Did they all make it through the first time?"" I asked. I'd been so focused on Arkanthros, I'd stopped paying attention. Jomar nodded.

""Well, you know, at the end of the day, this really wasn't that bad of a job,"" Liam said philosophically.

""I know,"" I said. ""We let them get the jump on us, and still won without much of a fight. Uhh, except for Angie, that is.""

""Wasn't a fight,"" she assured me, still wiping blood off her face. ""More of a curb-stomp. Those imps are pussy little bitches.""

""Well, there ya have it!"" Gary laughed.

I went to check on the pink-haired woman and the deer-antlered men. I used some healing magic to sort the former out, and got the latter uncollared. As soon as I did, they all smiled at me, embraced each other, and then turned into bucks and bounded away.

""Huh,"" I said. I've seen that species before, but for the life of me, didn't know what or who they were. Inanna didn't either, knowing only that some sort of deer-people existed in the deep forests of the spirit world, keeping mostly to themselves.

As for the pink haired woman, she managed to find a small, shy smile for me when she was all healed up. She touched her chest with her fingertips as she smiled, and then said ""Erinne.""

""Erinne?"" I asked. ""Is that your name?"" I touched her shoulder gently. ""Erinne?""

She nodded and flashed me that furtive smile again. I touched my own chest. ""Jerry."" I then pointed to the others. ""Inanna, Gary, Angie, Liam.""

She glanced around, uncertain, so I offered her a hand, which she regarded for a moment before she tentatively took it.

""Come with me. We'll get you some clothes, some warm food, and figure out how to talk to you. Then, we'll figure out how to get you home.""

I sure hoped she still had a home to return to. The two fauns followed gamely.

""Are you guys coming with us?"" Liam asked. Billy shrugged. ""Got nowhere else to go. Figured we can explore the material world for a bit."" Liam looked a question at me, but I just shrugged.

""Suits me,"" I said.

We all headed back to the woods, so Inanna could explain to the Huorns that they were safe now. I wasn't sure how she intended to do that, given that they didn't speak. But I'm sure she knew what she was doing.

""Does that happen a lot?"" Liam asked as we walked.

""What's that, the baddies defeating themselves?"" I asked.

""Yeah.""

I nodded thoughtfully. ""Not every time. But the thing is, when you go full comic-book evil, you kind of have to give up on being very competent, I think. The more evil they are, the more they tend to shoot themselves in the foot.""

""Heh. I kinda like this job,"" he said.

I sighed. ""It does grow on you a bit,"" I admitted. I snorted a laugh, thinking about Arkanthros' plan.

What an idiot."

***Memory transcription subject: Nedaul, Tulsek Combat Medic for Krakotl Extermination Fleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 19th, 2136*

Buildings were rather sparse in the area. There were advertisements and barns here and there, but the three things that took up most of the space along the roads were just fields, front lawns, and forests.

To my surprise, it looked familiar to where I grew up, and I found myself reminiscing about home even as my paws gripped Dean’s terrifying form.

The cool air that whipped past us took me back to the days of my youth, before I moved to Nishtal and enlisted in their forces. But, that air carried with it something else, a familiar odor that shook me to my core.

*It’s the only scent trail leading from the prison…*

“I r-recognize this,” I stammered, drawing the attention of the Human in front of me.

“What do you mean?  


“The s-smell…I saw Cole back during the c-crash.”

Dean slowed the bike to a halt and turned his body slightly to place an eye on me.

“You *saw* him?”

“I t-tried to shoot him, but I m-missed.”

The Human considered the new information for a moment before hanging his head and letting out a lengthy sigh.

“Honestly, I wish that you’d hit your shot. If your fleet came to Earth to kill monsters, Cole would have been an ideal target.”

That comment sent my head spinning. What kind of predator would be considered a monster by its own kind? I didn’t get much time to think about it before Dean twisted the bike’s throttle and we continued our reluctant pursuit.

I tried to take my mind off of the hunt, focusing on the landscape instead.

The leaves on most of the trees were orange, many already fallen to the ground. But others retained their green hue, towering high with conical builds that tapered off at the top. Judging by the fact that the fields looked recently harvested, I expected that it would only get colder.

*The environment isn't really so different. It's almost tranquil.*

It was baffling to see how much of the countryside was just farmland, but I guessed that the Humans needed something to feed their cattle with. They’d only just entered the galactic stage, so they weren’t able to pad their food reserves with Federation citizens. All of their awful meals were raised here on Earth.

However, it was also clear that Humans had not made *all* of their local fauna into livestock. No doubt, they wished to preserve their hunting practices as well.. As we zipped down long, open roads, I could spot, and more often smell, various animals nearby, free-roaming prey to be run down and consumed.

There were even some larger, long-legged prey animals with white tails that I was sure Dean wouldn't be able to resist chasing. Yet, when his eyes locked on the small herd standing by the tree line, he simply remarked that ‘the deer were losing their color for the winter’ and that 'they'd start laying low pretty soon when the cold hit’.

He said it flatly, just like he did everything else.

Given how unphased Dean seemed about his environment, I could conclude that, not only had our bombing missed a few targets, the fleet had seemingly failed tremendously. Why else would he be so unconcerned?

He did, however, mention that the communications grid was down, forcing us to use a radio transceiver to check back in with the prison. Our fleet managed to do some damage, but not nearly enough to wipe out these awful predators entirely.

I tried to pry more details about the attack from the Human once or twice, though it was hard to muster up the courage to speak to him. Dean was decidedly tight-lipped about the whole thing, either trying to keep me in the dark or growing tired of my yapping.

Neither of those things were ideal for me.

Frankly, I wasn’t sure *how* the bombing had managed to fail. Even with the Humans’ defensive advantage, they were clearly outnumbered and outgunned. Something had happened later in the battle that we couldn’t have anticipated. And, for some reason, Dean was unwilling to let me know what it was.

The silence around the topic was strange considering how willingly the Human divulged unrelated information. He occasionally made offhand comments, more to himself than me, and he didn’t bother with the flowery language that other Humans typically employed around Federation denizens. I supposed that Dean had no reason to hide his own barbaric nature. We were already on a hunt. Any facade was long-dead.

*I’m sure I’ll find out what happened during the bombing soon enough. I don’t need to draw his ire anymore by asking him questions that he clearly wishes not to answer.*

As we neared the tracker’s blip, Dean made some uncomfortable detours through the numerous fields. The maneuverable nature of the bike made it ideal for completely disregarding the roads. Still, it wasn’t a smooth ride through what remained of the crops that had covered the land before. Judging from what was left, they grew many different varieties of plants.

*It's surprising that they don't just use one crop for their cattle feed. I suppose that even these beasts are smart enough to know about crop rotation.*

The whole area had been completely upturned after recent harvests, causing it to feel like we were riding over a continuous plain of speed bumps. It took a little effort to not fall off the bike.

*I never thought I’d hold onto a predator so tightly.*

“It's a good thing the harvests are already done,” Dean called back to me as we trundled over the lingering ruffage. “Easier to hide in the plants, especially with how tall the corn gets. Farmers plucked the fields early this year. Processing plants were under a heavy load with all the galactic affairs. Weather wasn’t kind either, lots of rain lately. We’re lucky the last few days have been dry.”

Why Dean, a prison warden, knew so much about the local farming practice was a mystery to me. It's not like he was involved with the process. It didn't make a lot of sense for him to be educated on cattle feed, but I wasn't about to ask more questions. I didn’t want to annoy him.

Despite my predicament, I couldn’t help but enjoy the aroma of the alien flora. The planet was shockingly beautiful. It was a shame that it was host to such dangerous creatures.

*Maybe we could have spent some time developing a virus or something. It feels wrong to glass such a spacious landscape just because of its conquerors.*

Our chaotic trailblazing brought us to another wooded area. As soon as we entered the woods, I could make out a new scent. It was somewhat metallic, but not unlike a smell that I was already far too familiar with.

We weaved between trees and crossed a narrow stream, growing closer to the blip. Once we finally reached the signal, my initial suspicions were confirmed.

“Yeah, that figures,” Dean muttered as he kicked out the bike’s stand and leaned it over.

We both disembarked to get a better look at the scene. On the ground was a small tracker chip. Around it, crimson blood had stained the fallen leaves, darkening the vibrant oranges that covered the forest floor.

“He r-ripped it out,” I nearly choked on the words. “The t-tracker…”

Humans didn’t even have real claws. The fact that Cole managed to get it out…I shuddered where I stood.

“H-how did he even d-do this? To force through that p-pain…”

“He's a damned monster. That’s how.” Dean replied.

“All of you are m-monsters,” my tail fell low to the ground. “Every Human is a p-predator. This is j-just a testament to your n-nature.”

Dean didn’t respond. He simply walked over to the chip, bent down, and gingerly picked it up.

Then, he held it out towards me expectantly.

“You’re up, Bloodhound.”

*No way.* ***No!***

“I’m *n-not* taking that scent!” I staggered backwards away from the beast’s outstretched hand.

Sniffing out the blood of my comrades was one thing. Even if it made me uncomfortable at times, their blood was pure prey blood, and I only followed the scent to try and save their lives.

This was tainted predator blood, the very scent we were told to avoid at all costs. Certainly there was a different scent I could use. I could just track the natural body odors. I’d already caught traces of Cole’s scent as we’d gone down the road.

*Yet, the scent of blood is far more noticeable. I can almost* see *the odor as it trails away…*

Blood always stood out a little more than other scents. After all, blood signaled danger that needed to be avoided.

Dean continued to hold the chip out towards me, not rescinding his instruction. Even with his stone-faced expression, I could feel his patience dwindling.

*Damn it…For the herd. For Falkit.*

I stepped towards the bloodied chip, closed my eyes, and leaned in for a whiff.

*So metallic. It’s the blood of a meat-eater. Tainted, awful, filthy predator blood…*

My head started spinning and I couldn’t stop myself from retching. Turning away from the chip, I lost my last meal into the leaves alongside the rest of the convict’s blood.

Still, I’d gotten a good smell of the stuff. I could tell exactly where the trail led. It was strong, impossible to miss.

“Well?” the Human asked expectantly, seemingly uncaring for my sickness. “Can you track it?”

Once I steadied myself, I gulped back the rest of the bile and reluctantly answered.

“Y-yes. I can t-track it.”

Dean nodded his head and meandered over to the bike’s radio. He pressed a couple of buttons and the static sound confirmed that it was operational.

“Hey, George. Can you hear me? Give me a status report.”

After a few moments, a gruff response came through. It was the voice of the Human that placed the collar around my neck.

“I hear you. Everything is stable over here. Did you find Cole yet?”

“Hardly,” Dean replied. “He ripped the tracker out just like I suspected. We’ve got the scent, so we’ll be following that from here on out.”

“How’s the alien bastard? Giving you any trouble?”

“Not as much as you do. Honestly, I might’ve found your replacement.”

“Pfft, like you could find anyone better. Whatever. Just don’t do anything stupid, old man. Let me know when you’re about to leave our radio range.”

“Will do. Contact me if you run into any trouble over there.”

“We have it handled. Have a little faith.”

“Fair enough. I’ll leave you to it.”

Dean toggled the radio off, then turned back to me.

“Alright. Let’s go.”

Just like that we were back on the bike and blazing across a new set of fields. The Human offered me some water to wash out my mouth. I wanted to push it away, but the taste of vomit was decidedly too unpleasant to not accept the drink.

Zipping between rows of crops, I directed the beast as we went, telling him when the scent was getting weaker and nudging us back on the right path. I’d followed the scent of blood many times before, but this was different. Never had the action felt so predatory.

*I’m not tracking this to offer medical aid. This is a true hunt. Oh, Kha-Taul. Why is this my fate?*

Eventually, we made it back onto the road. The rattling caused by the uneven ground of the farmland faded atop the pavement. Once again, I could only hear the wind in my ears, the tires gripping the pavement, and the hum of the electric motors.

As we rode, I realized that we'd gotten quite far from the prison already. I quietly considered what options I had available to escape my predatory captor. Maybe if I got away, I could find a way to break the rest of my herd out? It was a long shot, but worth entertaining.

At first I thought of using the stitching needle in my kit to puncture Dean’s neck. But, ultimately I decided that it just wouldn’t do enough damage to actually kill the beast.

Then, I considered going for his gun, but it was tightly strapped into a hoster, and I didn’t know a thing about operating Human firearms. Dean would certainly beat me to the punch if I went for it.

*“If you try to kill me, I'll kill you first. That's a promise.”*

Could I just best the Human physically? My claws were sharper. But then again, I’d seen what Human hands could do to flesh already.

*The convict actually tore the tracker from his own body. What brutality…*

I should have been content with the silence. But, as I considered Cole’s actions, morbid curiosity got the better of me.

“Why d-did he wait so long?” I wondered out loud.

“Hmm?” Dean turned slightly so his right ear faced me a little better.

“If Cole w-wanted to avoid detection, why w-wait so long to remove the t-tracker?”

“Give me your own best guess first.”

“Maybe he f-forgot about the tracker until he m-made it this far?”

Dean shook his head.

“He probably wanted to prioritize getting away from the prison when he had the chance. Cole knew that we’d be busy handling the crash landing and detaining all of your crew. First priority was creating distance between us. Otherwise, we might have just caught him during the chip removal.”

*I probably owe my life to those same priorities. Cole could have killed me after I emptied my gun, but he just ran away to make the most of the immediate situation.*

Dean's explanation checked out. The initial crash had been chaos incarnate. Taking advantage of it was a smart move. It was terrifying how intelligent the Humans were.

The Arxur were physically fast and powerful, but they relied *only* on those qualities. These new primate predators were crafty and that made them dangerous in entirely new ways.

“He m-made a good choice b-by running first.”

“Of course. Cole Clifton was a special operative in his day, proficient in just about every form of combat you could think of. He’s the kind of bastard you’d swear couldn’t be real if you didn’t see the record. I’ve read the case file myself, and he’s the real deal.”

I considered what manners of war these beasts may have concocted. If Cole was really well-versed in all of them, I could see why was considered such a formidable threat.

“There were some delicate international situations after the Sat Wars,” Dean continued. “Cole was assigned to handle groups of insurgents. But, during a raid on a compound, a mistake on his part led to a bomb detonating at a nearby school, killing some kids. After that, he grabbed his weapons, went AWOL, and did some…things. You already think Humans are monsters, so I’ll let you use your imagination.”

I was grateful that he didn't elaborate on that; I didn't want to hear about the depths of Human depravity. Anything that appalled a society of predators was probably something I was better off not knowing.

“Humans c-can’t maintain their morals forever,” I concluded. “Cole just t-turned into the uncontrollable m-monster that he always was d-deep down.”

The Human shook his head.

“Have you ever killed someone, Bloodhound?”

“First, my n-name is Nedaul, not Bloodhound, and I’ve only b-bombed monsters.”

“You don’t get it, then. It’s different when you see the light leave your target’s eyes, watching their hopes and dreams disappear in an instant. Your outlook changes, and you have to make a choice.”

“A ch-choice?”

“Are you truly the monster you suddenly believe you are?”

I shuddered and purged the thoughts from my brain. I didn’t need to entertain Dean’s predatory musings. This was just the beast’s way of infecting me with his terrible taint. I needed to be strong and stalwart in my values as a prey species.

We fell back into welcome silence as the bike rolled along the road. But, it wasn’t long until we were interrupted once again. Another vehicle was approaching us, traveling in the opposite direction. A myriad of red and blue lights flashed atop the car and a high-pitched siren pierced the quiet sounds of the bike with just a few short tones.

Dean slowed the bike as the car drew closer. The window rolled down to unveil another Human in a black uniform. The predator looked at me with the same contempt that the prison guards had displayed. Naturally, I shrunk under the monstrous gaze.

“Sir,” the new arrival turned to Dean. “Everyone is supposed to be taking shelter, and all non-allied survivors are to be handed over to the authorities’ custody. I don’t know exactly what species that one is, but I know for a fact that it’s not on the list of friendlies.”

Dean just nodded in response before slowly digging through a pocket in his artificial pelt.

“Yeah, about that…This is kind of a special case, officer,” he flashed some sort of identification at the other Human who leaned in to get a closer look. “This one is already under arrest.”

As I'd expected, Dean seemed more animated as he spoke to his predatory counterpart. Gone was the indifference that I'd seen since we left the prison. Instead, it was replaced with an air of professionalism.

The uniformed Human looked at Dean’s ID in silence for a moment before turning to finnick with a radio in front of him. The thing crackled to life and the monster began to speak.

“Hey, chief, we have a bit of a situation.”

Another voice with a higher pitch responded back through the transceiver.

“We’re *all* dealing with a fucking situation, Murphy. What’s so different about yours?”

The Human shook his head and sighed.

“Got this guy transporting a captured POW. I checked his ID. Dean Sullivan. Credentials say he's the warden at that prison. You know…*the* prison.”

The voice on the other side was silent for a moment before replying.

“Is the POW under control?”

“Seems like it.”

“Then let him go. He's more qualified to deal with these fuckers than we are. I don’t know what he’s up to, but frankly, I don’t want to find out.”

“Understood.”

The crackling of the radio diminished and the uniformed Human turned back to Dean again.

“Well, I suppose you have the authority to handle this one,” the beast sighed. “Just…as tempting as it might be, don’t torture it or anything. The UN was *very* clear about handling POWs with care. They’ll do anything to avoid provoking more alien forces. If you disregard that policy, they’ll be after *you* too.”

“The rest of the crew is detained fairly,” Dean replied with a dismissive wave of his hand. “I don’t tolerate the torture of prisoners, Human or otherwise.”

“Even if they *do* deserve it,” the other Human growled as he turned his head to me, causing me to shudder. “I hope you rot for what you’ve done. I’m under orders not to hurt you, but if someone else did, I wouldn’t pity you even for a moment.”

*Of course. He only refrains from harming me because of government restraints. There’s a bigger picture for these Humans. They’re biding their time for some kind of grand takeover. That's why we came here to deal with them.*

“Are we good here?” Dean asked. “We’re in a bit of a hurry.”

“Yeah, we’re good,” the enforcer replied. “Just be careful riding around out here. The shithead sitting behind you isn’t the only one that crash landed in the area. UN troops have been dealing with other survivors over the last couple of days, but I can’t promise that it’s safe. Just keep your eyes open. That’s all I got for you.”

“Understood. We’ll be on our way then. I’d tell you to have a good day, officer, but I don’t think this is a good day for any of us.”

“No kidding. Stay safe, Mr. Sullivan.”

“You too.”

The other Human raised his window and both vehicles continued onward. Dean turned his eyes back to the road as his flat tone returned.

“We're still on the scent, right?”

“Y-yes,” I replied, very clearly detecting the rank odor of Cole's blood.

Dean’s disinterested demeanor was far better than the predatory hostility that radiated from the other primates. Being on the receiving end of a monster’s animosity was far from ideal. I much preferred this emotionless tone.

The vitriol that the uniformed Human spat at me was still bouncing around my mind. Having received such hate-filled remarks, it was reassuring, knowing that he’d only restrained his bloodlust to satisfy the orders of his superiors.

Those words proved to me just how fragile Human discipline was. Their self-control wouldn’t last forever. Eventually, they'd grow tired of cooperation. Then, finally, the galaxy would see just how monstrous they truly were.

“W-would you be so merciful t-towards us if your V-Venlil pets weren’t watching?” I asked Dean with a hint of accusation. “Th-that Human clearly w-wanted me dead.”

“We’d probably be more hostile,” the Human admitted. “But, you *did* come here to kill us, so I wouldn't necessarily say that the hatred is unwarranted. There's probably a lot of people that would seek vengeance if they weren't afraid of the UN’s enforcement.”

“T-typical of your kind.”

“And what would you do if we attacked your homeworld? Would you show mercy to Human survivors?”

“Of c-course not. You’re p-predators. We came h-here to eliminate the th-threat that you pose. Why w-wouldn’t we defend our homes f-from your taint as w-well?”

Dean just gave that same light chuckle that sounded more like a growl than laughter.

“If you say so.”

I wanted to retort against his non-answer, but I held my tongue, recognizing that I was pushing my luck already. Still, I couldn't believe that this Human would ask such ridiculous questions.

Dean was trying to compare our situations like he wasn't a *legitimate flesh-eater*. If he was trying to take a moral high ground, he should have addressed the Mazic in the room first.

*What is this beast trying to prove to me with these trivial questions? He asks me if I would kill invading Humans…*

*Why wouldn’t I want to rid the universe of such monsters?*

The beast stared the girl down, beady eyes hidden behind mounds of matted fur regarding her in a cold, impassive gaze as steam erupted from its flaring nostrils. It towered over her, its sheer mass making the girl feel smaller than she already was. Her hands trembled at the site of it, and she remained frozen in place as she could not read the beast’s intent. Her eyes fell to its horns, their sharpness almost gleaming in the morning sun, and a dark part of her wondered if those would be the tools that it would use to deliver the end. She shook her head at such thoughts and pulled her gaze to the beast’s maw, the rhythm of its chewing almost entrancing, the crunch of its most recent food letting out a pulpy squelchy as its jaw continued to work. Still, the girl remained frozen in place, the fear of a hopeless escape locking her feet in place as a pair of hands pushed her forward.

“It’s alright,” Leaf said, “Bessie wouldn’t hurt a fly.”

The archer’s voice was soft compared to the usual harsh tone it carried when he spoke with his companions. His hands tapped her back gently, but to the girl it was as if he was kicking her forward.

Still, she would not move.

Leaf let out a breath, a mix of a sigh and a snort, as he patted the girl on the shoulders. He let her go and approached the beast casually, walking up to it as he placed his hand on its head, running a hand through its fur.

“Gods, you are due for a good brush,” he said in an apologetic tone, “sorry girl, I’ve been distracted as of late but I’ll try and do it more often.”

Leaf reached behind one of the beast’s horns and scratched. It let out a soft bellow and pressed against the archer, rubbing against him affectionately. With a smile Leaf produced a comb from his pocket and ran it through the beast fur. It glided through the beast’s pelt, catching occasionally when it encountered a particularly tangled spot. Leaf pulled at each snag gently, loosening the fur until the comb ran through the spot with each, whispering softly to the beast as he did so. It let out the occasional snort of discomfort, especially from the more stubborn knots, but the beast remained docile as the archer continued to work.

The girl stood there in awe, wondering how Leaf could approach, let alone touch and brush such an animal, and when he was finally done running the comb through the beast’s fur he put it back in his pocket. He pulled a brush out afterwards, but rather than continue his work he held it out to the girl.

“Your turn,” he said with a smile.

The girl stood in place for a moment, unsure of what to do. Leaf did not say anything, and continued to hold the brush out, petting the beast as it chewed on the feed that was placed at its feet.

Eventually, she stepped forward, and when the beast did not react to her movement she hurried to Leaf’s side, wondering if the man had some sort of magic that made it docile in his presence. She took the brush, and Leaf guided her hands to the beast’s.

“Bessie here loves a good brushing,” he said, “you just have to do it the right way, so you just have to move like this-”

Leaf guided the girl’s hands, making sure that she was doing gentle strokes with the brush as its bristles ran through the beast’s fur. It did not move as the brush continued to move, and after a while Leaf let go of the girl’s hands. She continued to brush, an almost meditative focus overtaking her as she smoothed out the beast’s pelt. Her eyes wandered up to one of its horns, and, remembering how Leaf scratched behind it, she reached out and did the same out of a powerful curiosity. As she did, the beast pressed against the girl, its freshly brushed fur soft against her skin. The beast let out a soft bellow and the girl was lost to the bea- Bessie’s softness. She kept scratching her behind the horn, giggling as Bessie nuzzled against her.

The tavern’s back door opened as Helbram, Elly, and Jahora emerged. The smaller woman had a plate of fresh bread and a steaming bowl of porridge in her hands, ready to approach, but stopped as she saw the girl was lost to Bessie’s fur.

She smirked, “She’s fallen victim too I see.”

Leaf grinned, “Of course, no can resist the softness when they get a taste,” his voice ringed with pride,” he patted the girl on the shoulder and stepped away to meet his companions, letting her continue her meditative task. He snatched a small piece of bread from the plate and nibbled on it absentmindedly, “She’s a quick learner and Bessie’s taken to her quick nicely I say.”

“That she has,” Helbram said. The large man was without his armor today, sporting his coat in the brisk morning air as he sipped at the steaming mug in his hand, “tis good to see.”

“It is most likely related to her origins as a Shade,” Elly said as she sipped at her own mug, “her intuition may be innate but she also possesses a knowledge that is far beyond the scope of someone that has lived in her condition,” she observed, “her ability to understand us, and, though slight, read would be the most obvious example, for no one - in this life - has ever taught her such things.”

The scholar’s words passed through the girl’s ears, but she did not question them. It was not the first time that they had such observations about her, and she could not detect any sort of trepidation or fear from Elly’s tone. It was pure curiosity, something that she understood completely.

The girl’s hands continued to move the brush, recalling that she’d often heard the townsfolk humming as they set about their tasks. She mimicked the behavior, a soft tune escaping from her lips as she brushed Bessie. It was a soft melody, one that she did not hear from the townsfolk, but for some reason felt the most familiar to her.

As the tune continued, a haze overtook her vision once again, and she saw that her hands had grown bigger, the brush that they held more ornate than the simple tool she’d be given. Her fingers were long, but slender, and there was a thin silver band on her finger, a soft blue gem set into it. The fur that she brushed had transitioned to a brilliant white hide, and while the song she hummed remained the same, her voice no longer carried the lightness of childhood to it. There was a soft, relaxed quality to it, soothing both the beast that she brushed and her own mind as the melody continued. She looked up, seeing that she was now brushing a horse, but the vision faded soon as she saw it turn its head, replaced by Bessie as she looked at her with her beady eyes. Jahora and the others were looking at her, expressions curious.

“That was beautiful,” Jahora said, a smile beaming from her face.

“It was,” Elly agreed. She walked up to the girl and wiped her eyes.

The girl was not even aware that she’d been crying.

Elly took her hands into her own and brushed away the stray furs that were stuck to them. She looked the girl in the eyes, her smile comforting, “You’ll have to teach me sometime.”

The girl nodded, but didn’t know what to say.

Jahora joined the scholar by her side, steaming bowl of porridge in the smaller woman’s hands, “Let’s get you some breakfast in the meantime.”

A sweet scent wafted from the porridge to the girl’s nose, and she felt herself start to salivate. Though not as frail as before, her hunger only seemed to grow as her frame started to fill out more and more. She nodded and followed Jahora towards the steps that rested against the tavern’s rear entrance. The rest of the party spoke amongst themselves, but her attention was wholly focused on the food, and she started to eat the moment that a spoon was given to her. Her grip on the utensil was not so rough as it was before, and while she ate with fervor no longer did specks of food smear against her cheeks. She did not know when this change occurred, but she did admit that it was nice to eat without Jahora having to wipe her off after every meal. Her bowl of porridge did not last long under her onslaught, and soon she found herself nibbling on a piece of bread while Jahora took the empty dishes from her.

“She needs a name,” she said.

The girl looked up at that, and she could see the group rubbing their chins in unison, something that she could not help but giggle at.

“You are quite right,” Helbram agreed, “Though I must admit I am quite lacking when it comes to such things,” he snorted, “Unless she would like to be saddled with such entracing names like Maude.”

She did not know why, but she shook her head fervently hearing that. Helbram laughed as she did.

“Snow,” Leaf said as he nodded to himself in satisfaction, “because of her hair… and because we found her in the snow.”

The party frowned as they looked at him.

“What?”

“You have inherited your father’s naming sense,” Helbram said in a dull tone, “That is for certain.”

“It’s a good name!” Leaf objected, “let’s see you lot come up with something better.”

He crossed his arms and huffed.

Jahora tapped her chin, “I’m afraid I’m having some trouble as well. It was my idea but for the life of me I cannot think of one suited to her. I’m not one to judge one based on name but with all she’s been through… she is deserving of one that suits her.”

The smaller woman looked at the girl with a smile, “Is there any name that comes to your mind?”

The girl’s eyes narrowed as she attempted to peer inward. Holding the bread in her mouth, she tapped her temples as she tried to think of something, and after a moment an idea started to form in her head. The haze returned to her vision, and she found herself standing in the middle of a field, the grass that surrounded her stretching endlessly around her. It swayed with the wind, almost like it was breathing as tides of dark green washes across its lighter shade. The size of her hands remained small in this vision, and she wore a simple white dress that matched her hair. In the distance, she could hear a far off voice.

*“...te…”*

She looked around, seeing no one around her, but she leaned in the direction of the voice, hoping to hear it one ag-

“I don’t think that is a wise choice.”

Elly’s voice pulled the girl from her vision, and she found herself facing the party once again. Jahora looked at the scholar, an eyebrow perked up as she regarded the scholar.

“Her thinking of her own name,” Elly explained, “Given that she is a Shade, it is highly likely that she will choose the one that she held in her past life.”

Elly stood up and walked up to the girl and placed a hand on her shoulder.

“Rather than bind herself to her past in such a way, she should have one that places her on a road that is wholly new, one that she will be free to forge by the ambitions of this life, not her previous one,” she smiled at the girl, “that is what she deserves.”

Jahora smiled with her friend, “You’re right, but I must admit I still have yet to come up with one,” she said with a sigh.

“Aria,” Elly said.

Her companions did not say anything, but leaned in for her explanation.

“A solo,” she said, “vocal, usually, done in the midst of an opera or even a simple play. A melody will accompany it, but it is meant to stand alone.”

“That sounds lonely,” Leaf said.

“Ah but you see, while an aria can be captivating by itself, its brilliance comes from what surrounds it. The build up, the environment, the story that has woven around it,” Elly explained, “should all of that be grand, the aria will shine all the more brightly in contrast, for even in the face of such brilliance, its melody alone will captivate the audience. It will stand on its own, but be raised to even greater heights by those around it.”

She looked at all of her companions, and they all shared a nod with one another. She looked at the girl and smiled again, “Does it suit your liking?”

The name passed through the girl’s mind. As it did, memories started to wash through her. Memories of the shack that she’d spent so much time in, memories of her wandering empty streets, avoiding the gaze that looked upon her with disdain, memories of her tears when her family ignored her, of the ache at her chest when she looked upon the happiness that others had, so far out of reach.

“Aria…” she said

The pain faded as she thought of Erik, of the kindness that he’d shown her when no one else had. Of Cora, who would treat her with the same warmth that she’d only seen from mothers so far away. Of Leaf, who’s seemed so rough with everyone else but so gentle with her. Of Elly, who’s expression was so calculative, but so thoughtful when it came to her. Of Helbram, who’s size intimidated her at first, but always lingered around her, shielding her from all that would harm her. Of Jahora, who’s warmth seemed endless, who’s kindness was boundless.

A haze came over her vision once again, but it was not from an echo of times long past, it was from the tears that had started to form in her eyes. Not tears of pain, of fear, of finding something that she did not know she lacked for so long.

When Aria looked up, she was smiling.

**Author's Note: This is a shorter chapter and while I originally tried to add some more stuff I felt that dialing in and focusing in on how Aria got her name makes the scene all the more meaningful rather than just an ""event"". To that extent I also wanted to show her actually bonding with the party as well, so while nothing super ""plot forward"" happens here I find it crucial for the sake of character development so I will  probably writing up something like this again for this arc so the events that do happen having much more weight to them. However, if you thought this dragged or if you think that more of this would make the pacing too slow please speak out. I'm always interested to see what you all think and while I have reasons for things I don't want to get too stuck in my own head.**

Well if you're listening to this then I was successful and am now most likely dead. Or perhaps at the very least returned to the motherland. Of the two I'm not sure which is worse. It doesn't matter, I deserve it, I deserve all the pain and punishment that can be brought upon a man. My sins are great, far greater than anything the church or God can forgive. This is my confession. 

My name is Savva Rolanevich Mikhailov, son of Rolan and Nayda Mikhailov. I possess a doctorate in human Psychology and a masters degree in Pharmacokinetics. I am… I was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and in 1941 I was put as lead scientist of an underground, highly classified, project in response to the Nazi invasion. I take full responsibility for the atrocities of the following account. Attached are my personal audio diaries for cataloguing progress, written surgical reports and autopsies of the experiments, as well as audio recordings and written transcripts of the experiment Testing Chamber’s microphones. 

It was my fault. I can never be forgiven.

&#x200B;

**Audio Diary,**

**14 August 1941:**

\[Mikhailov\]: Test, Test. I think this is working. Hello, this is Dr. Savva Mikhailov. Today is the first day actually on site at the facility. I am here currently with my two colleagues, Dr. Daniil Zhukov, our genius physician and Dr. Petro Smyrnov, our imported alchemist.

\[Zhukov\] \*stifling a chuckle\*

\[Smyrnov\] I am a pharmacist, thank you very much. 

\[Mikhailov\] \*chuckling\* I know, I'm just making fun, comrade.

\[Smyrnov\] I thought your recordings were supposed to be professional… and accurate.

\[Mikhailov\] Truthfully it's supposed to be a diary of sorts. 

\[**Sound of chair being pushed back and footsteps\]**

\[Mikailov\]\*whispering\* so I'm allowed to embellish a little. \*returning to regular tone\* And besides, is that not what you are? You mix together potent concoctions to heal our sick and deadly poisons to kill our enemies.

\[Smyrnov\] I am a man of science. 

\[Mikailov\] So were they. So are we. For the study of the sciences has always had that air of mysticism. Healers, psychics, and alchemists. Unravellers of the universe and explorers of the unknown. We have but only changed titles.

\[Smyrnov\] \*turning away from microphone\* Is he always like this?

\[Zhukov\] heh, you get used to him.

\[**Echo of approaching footsteps. Sound of knocking on metal**\]

\[Mikailov\] Ah commander what a lovely surprise.

\[Commander Vorobev\] I trust you are all settling in. We begin tomorrow.

\[Mikailov\] Yes sir, we are ready.

\[Vorobev\] You better be. Director Lysenko wants results, so I want results.

\[Zhukov\] You’ll get them sir.

\[**Long silence**\]

\[Vorobev\] I better. As you were.

\[Smyrnov\] We better get some rest.

\[Zhukov\] Couldn't agree more.

\[Mikailov\] One second I just need to turn this thing off—

\[Guard\] Alright let's seal ‘em in.

**\[Heavy metallic thud followed by grinding gears. Then silence\]**

\[Ex.2\] Eh, leave it… Looks like this is it. Not too bad.

\[Ex.4\] Yeah it's only thirty days, we can keep ourselves entertained.

\[Ex.1\] If you can keep yourself awake. How's that even going to be possible

\[Ex.3\] Through faith, comrade. Through faith.

\[Ex.1\] Don't touch me old man.

\[Ex.4\] What are your names? If you don't mind me asking. I'm Dimitri.

\[Ex.2\] Vaughn.

\[Ex.3\] I am Father Ivan Bogdanov, but you all may call me Ivan.

\[Ex.1\] I… am Yulian.

\[Ex.4\] What of you friend? What’s your name?

**\[Long silence\]**

\[Ex.4\] Not in the mood huh? That's alright, we’ve got thirty days.

\[Ex.2\] Anyone else smell that?---

**Diary recording:**

\[Mikailov\] Log 1. August fifteenth, 21:03. We received our experiments today. Five enemies of the state, I don't know exactly who they are. Main point is that they are relatively healthy and hardly complain. Dr. Zhukov, Dr. Smyrnov, and myself are taking shifts to watch the experiment unfold. I suppose I should explain the experiment. We, collectively, are here to test a newly synthesised gas based stimulant, created by Dr. Smyrnov and a few of his fellow Ukrainian alchemists. Heh. We are here testing in the hope that the drug can be utilised on the battlefield against the invading germans. We are looking for any long lasting negative side effects of the drugs. We also aim to—

**\[Metalic door opening then closing. Approaching footsteps followed by a metallic chair being pulled out.\]**

\[Zhukov\] Cheery crew they are.

\[Mikailov\] Oh?

\[Zhukov\] First ten minutes into my shift, they begin talking about their first dead pets. Why? There are almost a million other things they can discuss.

\[Mikailov\] Humans are odd social creatures. We form strong bonds with one another over shared trauma and grief. Besides, it's not exactly like they can talk about the weather.

\[Zhukov\] Egh, fair enough. \*yawn\* Well I'm going to sleep, you should too. Your shift is only a few hours or so away.

\[Mikailov\] Good point. End log—

&#x200B;

**19 August 1941,**

**Testing Chamber and Observation room microphone audio recording:**

\[Ex.2\] That was the last time I ever saw her. And the second time I ever saw a dead body.

\[Ex.1\] Heh, you reminded me of a time when I came across my two cousins who had died. It had been a particularly bad winter and I remember hardly hearing from my uncle until one day I got a frantic letter telling me to come see him. He said he was starving.  I prepare to venture some two miles over. Before I am even in the house I see red stains in the snow. I rush in and find a trail of blood covering the floor leading to my uncle’s room. 

There’s more blood the closer I get. In the hall I see tiny, little bloody handprints and some tracks going toward the front door. There’s another blood trail leading from my little cousins’ room, their door was splintered apart. I quietly open my uncle’s door and see him there… god… seeing their little faces, frozen in fear. If I had any breakfast to spare, it would have poured out of me. My uncle saw me then, gore casing his face, little chunks in his beard. Egh, thinking of it now. He charged at me with a spark in his eyes that was not wholly his. He was like a wild animal, a wild feral animal. I only got to the kitchen before he found me. He was deranged, so I grabbed their only pan and bashed his head in.

**\[There is a long silence only broken up by Ex 3 lightly whispering incoherent prayers\]**

\[Ex.4\] The hunger must have gotten to him.

\[Ex.2\] Or the cold.

\[Ex.5\] Or the voices

**\[Another long silence\]**

\[Ex.2\] The what?

\[Ex.5\] You hear them don't you, the voices. Always there, whispering thoughts into your mind. Telling you to give in to your most carnal, depraved and debaucherous urges. Almost willing you to commit obscene and horrid acts. Perhaps that’s what your uncle heard. He was starving, you said, his mind and will were at their weakest. So when he heard a voice whisper a solution to his hunger and end to his pain, he listened… and then he feasted.

\[Ex.4\] I liked you better when you didnt talk.

**\[Footsteps entering observation room\]**

\[Zhukov\] Are they still arguing about who had seen a dead body first?

\[Mikhailov\] They were. You've arrived just in time for a slight change in topic, so to speak.

\[Zhukov\] You still want me to take over?

\[Mikhailov\] No, no. But please, stay. I enjoy your company. 

\[Ex.3\] You speak of demons. Agents of the fallen one, who would see man turned from our holy creator’s light.

\[Ex.5\] Perhaps. I know not the lips from which the voices spill, I only know they are there.

&#x200B;

**Diary recording:**

\[Mikailov\] Log 2. August twentieth 07:45. I Forgot to record this log last night as i was racked with exhaustion from watching the experiments. While their cognitive function and alertness has remained mostly average, there appears to be a depressant effect. It is unclear if this is a side effect of the stimulant, or simply the circumstances they have put themselves in. Though I must say I have gleaned much entertainment and insight from these last few days of depressing ramblings. It is very interesting to see where a human mind will go when given an indefinite time to be conscious. I wonder if this is the body's form of directing and weaving subconscious thoughts into conversation. I must admit even if the gas yields no true benefit or it is discarded for an alternative, this test has most certainly the potential to expand our understanding of the ever complex Human mind. I'm thankful to be a part of it. End log—

**20 August 1941,**

**Testing Chamber and Observation room microphone audio recording:**

**\[Footsteps approaching and entering observation room\]** 

\[Zhukov\] Good afternoon! Which macabre topic of storytelling have they decided on today?

\[Smyrnov\] Nothing.

\[Zhukov\] Nothing? Huh…? Why are they so spread out? 

\[Smyrnov\] They’ve become paranoid. They’re convinced one of them is going to kill the others.

\[Zhukov\] Why?

\[Smyrnov\] I'm uncertain. Most likely a side effect of the gas. 

\[Zhukov\] What’s that they are saying?

\[Smyrnov\] Take a listen for yourself.

\[Ex.1\] \*whispering directly into one of the microphones\* I know that priest is just putting up an act. Lull us into safety then, boom! But he doesn't fool me. His holier than thou schtick is all a front, you have to trust me

\[Ex.2\] \*whispering directly into another of the microphones\* I don't trust that German, you all shouldn't either. Quiet for so long. What's he up to, huh? Sitting over there, plotting something. I won't let him out of my sight. I'm not just staying awake to be free anymore. You hear me?

\[Ex.4\] We’re all going to be alright. We’re all going to be alright. We’re all going to be alright. I just have to watch everybody, no one will make a move without me seeing them.

\[Ex.3\] I know you can hear me. Please let me out. I'm nothing like the rest of these blasphemies. What could I have done wrong? I am a man of our lord God. Why? After my many years of service am I now treated as a common criminal? Oh, please, whatever you want, I'll give it to you. I could tell you their sins, I can tell just by looking at them. No that doesn't appease you? You want gold? I buried the holy relics before I was taken. Let me out of here and I'll take you to them. 

**\[Pleading and bargaining would continue for the next 72 hours\]**

&#x200B;

**Dairy Recording:**

\[Mikalov\]: Log 3. August twenty sixth 18:17. To be honest there is both much and very little to report. The last handful of days have been nothing but the experiments’ paranoid ramblings. Smyrnov and myself fear this is a side effect of prolonged exposure to the stimulant. This is not overly detrimental to our cause, but it will need to be addressed if this stimulant is to see long term use. Zhukov wonders if there is something else at play. He’s convinced the experiment's psyches are fracturing through severe sleep deprivation. Though these concerns lack evidence, besides the paranoia. The experiments are still acutely aware of their surroundings and seem, by all observable accounts, to be physically healthy. No degradation that sleep deprivation could cause is evident in any of the experiments. I will report after my shift, tomorrow.

**27 August 1941,**

**Testing Chamber and Observation room microphone audio recording:**

\[Ex.1\] \*whispering directly into one of the microphones\* I can hear them now. Those voices the German was talking about. I don't know when it started, a few minutes ago? No, longer than that. Hours? Years maybe? I never seemed to notice them until right now. They tell me awful things, they ask me to do awful things. They are awful. Oh how I wish I could sleep, I know I would not hear them in my dreams. But I don't feel tired, I want to but I can't. I can't even bear to close my eyes, because then I see them, or think I see them. They’re like shadows, or hazy silhouettes, against the curtains of my eyelids. Like a form beneath the evermoving water, they’re right there but have no definite shape. 

The others can hear them too. The German hasn't moved from that spot in days, lucky for us it's right by the toilet. He’s covering his ears and rocking. Egh. Dimitri just wont stop smiling. He’s nodding along as if agreeing to every word they say. I don't know what Vaughan is doing…reading, I think. He has a book but he's just been staring at the open centre for hours. And of course the priest is praying ever so gently. Do you hear it? 

\[Ex.3\] \*repeatedly whispering into another microphone\* Non est potestas major quam tu, Domine mi, defende me et remove a malo. Deus tu, qui omnes oppressores dedecus, tuam summam voluntatem et auctoritatem exercendo, nullus mihi malus spiritus noceat. Deus, ad te confugio a diabolo, et a malis susurris et dolis me defende. Ad te confugi, Domine, ab inimicis malignis lucris. Amen.

\[Ex.1\] There they are again. Shall I tell you what they say? How they wish for me to perform such vile acts before you. Peel my eyelids or slowly pull out my thumbnails. Bath in the piss and shit that's casing the floor, or vomit and lick it back up. 

**\[Grotesque descriptions of actions continue mingled with prayers in the background\]** 

\[Mikailov\] Fascinating.

\[Smyrnov\] I believe disgusting would be a better suited word.

**Diary Recording:**

\[Smyrnov\] Must you? Right now?

\[Mikailov\] Yes. I want to get this down before I lose any details.

\[Smyrnov\] Fine. Just, be quiet. I want to sleep.

\[Mikailov\] Log 4. August twenty seventh 22:34. Smyrnov along with myself are now positive the stimulant is having a psychological hallucinogenic effect. As I have stated before this does not render the entirety of this experiment void, but it does mean the stimulant can only be used in small doses over only a few days at a time. That is to avoid these newer “manic” episodes. We are not sure if it was because of the suggestion of experiment 5 but it seems the entirety of the group has latched onto these “voices”. As…detailed by experiment 1 the voices are not… pleasant ones. I do ponder if we were to have introduced a separate idea, if the group would have fixated as strongly. Perhaps that can be a subsequent test, once we adjust the formula for the next batch. As it stands now however I am cautiously curious how the experiment will continue on. End Log—

**29 August 1941,**

**Testing Chamber and Observation room microphone audio recording:**

**\[Loud Screaming fills the background along with the slapping of barefoot on tile, the whispers of horrid acts and repeated prayers\]**

\[Smyrnov\] You sent for us? This had better be important.

\[Mikailov\] What’s that—? Is that screaming?

\[Zhukov\] Yes, come take a look at this. You see? Four just started screaming, completely unprompted. 

\[Smyrnov\] Why’s he running around the room?

\[Zhukov\] I don't know, it started doing that just before you two came in.

\[Mikailov\] Fascinating? Ah, I see you turned the microphones down.

\[Zhukov\] Yes, i was growing tired of hearing Stalin’s new torture methods. Ow. 

\[Smyrnov\] Careful or you might be the next test subject.

\[Mikailov\] How long has this been going on? 

\[Zhukov\] A few hours. Heh, you’d think they were deaf. Look at them, they barely even noticed it.

\[Mikailov\] hmmm…

**\[Screaming stops and is replaced with a rasping breath and the occasional squeal. Whispering continues\]**

\[Mikailov\] What just happened?

\[Zhukov\] I think he just tore his own vocal cords.

\[Smyrnov\] My God.

**\[Screaming is resumed\]**

\[Zhukov\] Great, now Five. I wonder if they’ll all do it?

\[Mikailov\] Yes, I wonder?

\[Smyrnov\] What the fuck are Two and Four doing? Egh I'm going to be sick.

\[Zhukov\] It seems to be a crude form of paper mache. Though it is not a very sanitary one.

\[Smyrnov\] Great. And they’re using it to cover the portholes. I don't envy our sanitation crew. 

**\[Screaming and all other noise from within stop\]**

\[Mikailov\] And just like that, this all has become far more intriguing than I initially thought.

&#x200B;

**Diary recording:**

\[Mikailov\] Log 5. August twenty eighth 11:00. An interesting event occurred during the early hours of the morning. Apparently experiment four had screamed loud enough and for long enough to rip and tear its own vocal cords. Shortly after Five had taken up the screaming. Two and the newly muted Four proceeded to tear apart the holy books we had given them and lather the pages in their own faecal matter and urine. They then proceeded to apply these pages to any and all observation portholes, rendering visual observation impossible. They have also ceased any direct form of audio for the first time since the room was unoccupied. Currently we are monitoring the group's oxygen consumption to ensure they are still alive. Upon my request and insistence, we have elected to hold off on ending the test early so as to glean as much data as possible. We have also yet to inform the facility commander of this incident. I truthfully am just too invested in where this all leads. I will update when something of significance has occurred.

&#x200B;

**Diary recording:** 

\[Smyrnov\] Why’d you bring that in here?

\[Mikailov\] I wanted my statement to be accurate, so I will record while I check the systems. Log 6. August 31th 09:23–

\[Smyrnov\] 25. Your watch is off.

\[Mikailov\] Ah, thank you. \*whispers\* see this is what i was talking about. \*returns to normal volume\* 09:25. We have been monitoring the oxygen intake and checking the microphones hourly, still no sound. Are we sure the internal microphones are working?

\[Smyrnov\] As sure as we can be without checking them physically.

\[Mikailov\] Mmm, alright. As I was saying, still no sound from the interior of the Testing Chamber. The current oxygen intake is… That can't be right. Are we positive that these gauges are accurate?

\[Smyrnov\] The technician just verified them for the third time today. They’re accurate.

\[Mikailov\] Then what the hell are they doing in there? This shows their oxygen intake is nearly eight times the amount they should be consuming. Unless they are constantly running or doing something equivalent, but then we should hear them. Shouldn’t we?

\[Smyrnov\] I don't know what to tell you. Maybe they broke the microphones like they blocked the portholes. 

\[Mikailov\] What if they’re comatose? What if they overdosed on the stimulant and it somehow increased their heart rates causing heavier breathing? We need to find out. I suppose I should contact Commander Vorobev.

\[Smyrnov\] That's probably the right decision. But I'd turn that off first—

&#x200B;

**1 September 1941**

**Testing Chamber and Observation room microphone audio recording:**

**\[Intercom activated, tone dial\]** 

\[Mikailov over intercom\] We are opening the Testing Chamber to test the microphones; step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.

\[Ex.1\] We no longer wish to be freed.

\[Mikailov over intercom\] Come again?

\[Ex.2\] Leave us alone.

\[Zhukov over intercom\] Why do you want to be left alone? Are you alright in there?

**\[Long Silence\]** 

\[Zhukov over intercom\] Hello? I asked if you all are alright?

**\[Long Silence. Intercom is turned off\]**

\[Vorobev\] Well thats just fucking great. Good use of the Kremlin's resources. \*sigh\* Well lets just open it up and kill them. Experiment is a failure.

\[Mikailov, Smyrnov, and Zhukov\] No

\[Mikailov\] Sir, this experiment has yielded fantastic results. We can't just kill them and end it.

\[Vorobev\] Why not? What's there to study? You can't even see or hear them. Believe me doctor, I'm not a man beyond reason, but how can we benefit by not simply ending the experiment?

\[Mikailov\] If we open the door and send in a cleaning crew, even if they won't talk at least then we can observe them for the remaining days. We can also simply check if they are alive or vegetables, if so then we’ll end the experiment and adjust the gas. This is only a waste of the Kremlin's money if we can't observe the effects. 

\[Smyrnov\] \*whispering\* But then we will have to flush the Testing Chamber and sully the controlled environment.

\[Mikailov\] \*whispering\* This is the only way forward. Sometimes scientific exploration requires compromise and sacrifice. \*returning to normal volume\* So commander is that a fair compromise?

\[Vorobev\] Perhaps. Do you believe in the prospect of this gas?

\[Mikailov\] Yes sir. 

\[Vorobev\] Very well. I'm not wholly convinced, but I suppose I have to trust you doctor. We will work out the finer details on how to proceed later.

\[Mikailov\] Yes sir. Thank you sir.

\[Zhukov\] Yes, thank you very much sir.

\[Smyrnov\] Thank you sir.

**\[Autocracy Space\] — \[Sut, Izalia, 1203\]**

Brilliant streaks of red and blue cut through the air, and all Opali could do was cower in the pit she was taking refuge in.

All around and all above, thousands of lasers scorched and glassed and razed. Foliage set alight, trees toppled, and the cries of autocracy soldiers grew louder and louder. “On the hill with the big rock, just behind-” “Medic, medic!” “I said line new power routes, what do you mean we-”

Burying her head between her paws, Opali froze as she witnessed a nearby male conscript — just around her age — get cut in half by a stray beam. The soldier’s upper half spasmed, brain late in processing the near-instant loss of half his body, then went limp. *I give my reverence*, Opali managed to think as the soldier crumbled into an ungainly heap of black fur onto the forest floor. *I give my reverence. I give-*

&#x200B;

“Hey, teddy!” A shrill voice yelled, and Opali flinched.

Fumbling around the hole, she turned, lasgun aimed. The speaker was definitely a Xeno. The question was, what species were they and were they an ally? Amidst all the smoke and light, her small amber eyes took in three key things. The first was bare flesh where any other sensible epidermis should be. The second was the speaker’s flat, scrunched up head — no discernible protruding ears, or snout whatsoever. And the third was the Xeno’s eyes. Beady, unreflective green dots inside a sea of white.

*Just my luck.* It was a scheming, screeching *human*.

&#x200B;

The primate dove down in Opali’s shelter, landing ungracefully on their hands and knees. Behind their visor, she could see their fleshy lips moving, but she could only make out every other word or so. “Fuck’s- sake-  you- hear? Is- translator-” They fumbled with their helmet, then the two of them flinched as a red laser streaked over their hiding.

“Your translator’s on,” Opali shouted. “I said your translator’s on!” She raised her voice further as an explosion cracked in the distance. The ape leaned in close, and Opali’s nose scrunched up as their oily smell filled her nostrils. Still, she couldn’t discern their gender.

“Move over! We gotta take cover. The Union’s gonna start shelling our position, now that our shield carriers are down-” The primate babbled on, but Opali stopped listening. *Our shields are down?* Her stomach churned as images of her family flashed through her head — father, mother, little Ozzo — without shields, the autocracy and their allies were fish swimming upstream. *This forest’s lost. Defending it was a stupid idea. What was the proposed tactic called again — guerrilla warfare?* Her eyes narrowed onto the ape. Ha. That was *their* kind’s ideas.

&#x200B;

“Hey, I said-” Opali scowled as the primate tried to shove her over — key word being tried. With her armor, she probably weighed two of them.

Still, she shifted over, careful not to crush her stubby tail, and the soldier grunted as they settled down on the dirt while gripping their kinetic rifle. “This is fucked. This is so fucked,” they rambled, and a growl began to rise in Opali’s throat. Did this ape ever shut their jaws- er…lips?

“Those damned bugs failed to hold the mountain fortresses, so now the Union’s in control of the bunker systems. This *whole continent’s* lost. Still, I heard our ship reinforcements are only a few days away, so we just gotta hunker out till then. Even if it takes a little while for orbital bombardment to secure our position, we can survive that, right?” The soldier elbowed Opali’s side, and gave their eerie gesture of happiness — mouth parting to show their teeth. The human’s voice softened. “Can’t wait to return to base. Hot food, mattresses…” Opali felt her ire slowly subside, beginning to genuinely listen. *That’s right. In the end, we’re both sapients, just trying to survive this chaos-*

&#x200B;

“…and showers-” The human suddenly leaned in, and their nose wrinkled. “Yeah, you definitely need one. You smell funky.”

Opali snapped.

“If I smell so bad, then get out of here!” She roared, heaving up the soldier with a single paw. They thrashed, batting and swatting at her arm. “You chattering ape!”

&#x200B;

The primate’s eyes bulged, mouth agape. “Ted- teddy, calm down-”

“Never call me that again!” Opali spat, bitter humiliation fully unleashed. To think that her species, her civilization — of farmers and scientists — got dragged into this conflict by this *pathetic excuse* of a mammal and their cronies-

Not only that, but for her people’s appearance to get teased because they resembled some *stupid dirtling toy* —

&#x200B;

“Attention please.” A monotone synthesized voice cut in over the blasts of exploding mortar shells.

The two stopped wrestling as a paw-sized shadow appeared over the hole and the primate’s lips curled in disgust. “You!” The soldier seethed.

“Me.” The reeseth replied, antennae twitching through their oxygenated exo-suit. Opali looked between the bug and the primate as they stared each other down — two green eyes locked on four coppery compound ones. *The two have history? Let me guess. The ape poked the beetle and got stung.*

&#x200B;

“Oh great, now I gotta hunker down with you.” The primate sighed as they slipped free from Opali’s paw.

“I am reciprocating similar negative feelings.” The beetle’s translator droned. As she flew down into the trench, the human yelped. Opali rumbled with laughter as the soldier crawled away on their back — that’s right, they had a fear of bugs, stemming from their exposed flesh. To be honest, she also found the reeseth’s appearance unnerving…but she wouldn’t admit that now.

“Hey, don’t laugh! Did you hear the sound her wings made? Ugh-” The human settled in the corner farthest from the beetle.

&#x200B;

“My broodmates informed me that my wings sound pleasant,” the reeseth’s translator buzzed. Opali guessed that she was offended, though her translator couldn’t convey the tone of her chittering. “In fact, that is where my name stemmed from. Whirring wings over warm water.”

“Whirring wings-” Opali blinked. Why did the insectoids have such long, pretentious titles? *Just pick a letter and name your family after it. Simple as that.*

“Yeah, I ain’t saying all that. How bout Wwoww?” The human asked, and Wwoww buzzed in what Opali guessed was indignation.

&#x200B;

“I agree with the ape on this one,” Opali rumbled.

“Wha- ape? Can’t you read, te- uhh- bear? I’m Gamble.” The human pointed towards a rectangular piece of cloth stitched over the breast of their uniform, and Opali squinted.

“Hrmph. That title does suit your kind well. Tell me, what other names do you have? Arsonist? Racer? Orbitdiver?”

&#x200B;

Gamble scoffed. “You-“ The human’s eyes widened and then they pointed up, just before a blanket of dirt and gravel slammed down.

Opali shook the grit from her dark fur and sneezed as a cloud of dust made its way through her helmet — wait. She couldn’t-

She tried to inhale, only to get a mouthful of soot. To her side, Gamble was coughing uncontrollably and opposite, Wwoww was vibrating furiously. *We’re going to suffocate!*

&#x200B;

Flinging the human over her shoulder with one paw, Opali carefully cradled the reeseth against her stomach, lumbering to her full height. Her head barely peeked out of the hole.

“What are you doing?” Gamble wheezed. “Get-”

“If we can’t see anything, the union forces can’t either!” Opali yelled between hacking coughs. *Well, unless they have thermal vision. But the Union's known for supplying their soldiers pretty poorly. Hopefully these soldiers aren’t the exception.*

&#x200B;

“We will have no cover outside. All the nearby trees have been razed,” Wwoww buzzed. “But I suppose death by laser is preferably to asphyxiation.”

“Craters!” The human gasped. “Get to a fresh artillery hole — Union bastards won’t blast the same place twice now, will they?”

“That is a statistical fallacy. To ensure that they have wiped us out, there is no doubt that-”

&#x200B;

Ignoring the two, Opali climbed out of the pit. The air was still filthy, but it was marginally better. A explosion buffeted some ways to her side and she flinched, paws tightening around her allies as shrapnel whizzed by.

“They’re shelling between us and our comrades!” Opali rumbled. This isn’t good. *Do we let ourselves get cut off?*

“Yeah, we can see that! Fuck, just — can you skirt around?” The human shouted.

&#x200B;

Opali turned carefully towards the Union forces, her plantigrade legs burning as she squatted awkwardly. The smoke around them was just slowly but surely starting to dissipate — they’d have to make their choice now.

Her species wasn’t known for running. Far from it — but if she wanted to give her allies the best chance of survival…

Bracing herself, Opali lumbered forward towards retreat. Branches and leaves splintered under the combined weight of her and her companions, and lasers streaked across the burning forest as soldiers shot blindly, some cutting mere meters away.

&#x200B;

But none hit, and Opali continued charging forward, her lungs burning and her legs aching. Twenty meters- fifteen- then ten- finally, she spotted something. A hole. Skidding to a halt, she rolled.

Throwing Wwoww up into the air so the reeseth wouldn’t get crushed by accident, the soldier landed on her side with a thud, panting. Opali slowly collected herself, mind whirring as she looked around. Wait. The human- *Where’s-*

“Get- get off!” Gamble’s shrill voice came below, and Opali scrambled up.

&#x200B;

The soldier groaned as she backed away, cradling their squashed body.

“Are you okay?” Opali asked, kneeling beside Gamble as Wwoww landed on her shoulder, buzzing something as well.

By reverence, had she crushed them? *I’m sorry, I was so focused on getting us to cover-*

&#x200B;

She waited anxiously as the human stopped wheezing, and then they finally spoke, a smile on their face-

“Fucking hell, teddy — it’s nowhere near winter. You don’t have to enter hibernation, so why are you storing so much weight-” Opali slapped a paw down onto Gamble’s chest as Wwoww hummed in what she assumed was amusement -- still, she wasn’t angry. Letting out a heavy sigh of relief, Opali thought, *Xenos*.

As explosions rocked the desolate forest plains, laughter filled a small foxhole, and for a little while…everything in the galaxy was alright."

Below, the beach bustled with families. Children's laughter rose above the steady rush and retreat of the waves, clear and bright. Small hands sculpted castles and moats in the golden sand, each grain to brick in eyes still fresh. Toddlers squealed as gentle surf foamed over their feet. There was a purity in their amusement, as if they alone held the key to some secret language spoken only by the sea. Teenagers kicked footballs back and forth, the distant shouts of ""¡Pásala, pásala!"", the players leaping and twisting like characters in ancient myth, their bodies glistening with sweat and triumph, while mothers kept watch from colorful blankets spread across the beach. Landing on the warm sand, it cocked its head at the cries of niños chasing the waves, the singsong calls of the heladero selling his ice cream, the rise and fall of lively Spanish swirling through the air.   
  
""¡Mira, mamá! ¡Una gaviota!"" cried a small child, his excitement bubbling over at the sight of the feathered visitor. The mother looked up from her book, smiling warmly as she watched her son's fascination. Her voice, gentle yet firm, wove through the cacophony of the beach, ""Sí, mi amor, pero no te acerques demasiado. Déjalo en paz.""  
  
Away from the bustle, a lone couple sat facing the ocean, close but not touching. The woman hugged her knees as she gazed out at the water, her dark hair whipping in the sea breeze. Beside her, the man picked at shells in the sand, his shoulders hunched inward.  
  
""No sé, mi amor,"" Elena said with a sigh. ""It feels like we're just going through the motions lately. Like we've lost that chispa we had.""  
  
Javier's mouth twisted bitterly. ""Maybe you had too many wild dreams. We have responsibilities now, cuentas to pay."" He flung a shell aggressively into the waves. ""Not all of us have the luxury of chasing fantasies.""  
  
Elena turned to Javier, her eyes glistening. ""It wasn't always a fantasy though, was it?"" she said softly. ""We used to talk about exploring the world together. Seeing Machu Picchu, walking the Camino de Santiago, dancing in the streets of Rio during Carnival...""  
  
Javier sighed, his shoulders sagging. ""Eso fue antes. Before work, bills, family demands..."" He trailed off, picking up a stick and tracing aimless shapes in the sand.  
  
""But why can't we still make some of it happen?"" Elena pressed on. ""A trip somewhere, just you and me?"" Her voice took on a pleading edge. ""Don't you remember how it felt, when we first met, to imagine all the places we would go?""  
  
Javier was quiet for a long moment, watching the waves crash and recede. When he finally spoke, his voice was tinged with regret. ""I just don't know if those were ever more than dreams, mi amor."" He tossed the stick aside and stood, brushing the sand off his pants. ""We should head back.""  
  
Elena sighed heavily and accepted his outstretched hand. They slowly moved up the beach, tension radiating between them from the words that had gone unspoken.  
  
Javier couldn't bring himself to look at Elena, a whirl of emotions overwhelming him - frustration with himself for allowing practicality to dampen his passionate spirit, envy for Elena's unwavering idealism, guilt for not being the partner she deserved.  
  
Most of all, he felt the pressure of his family's expectations weighing down on him. As the oldest son, it was expected that he have a secure career, to be the one who could be relied on. His parents had ridiculed him when he'd spoken about pursuing his creative dreams, telling him they were impractical. ""You must think of your future,"" they'd scold.  
  
So he'd chosen engineering, working hard over the years until he reached a high degree of talent. Despite this success, a hollowness lingered inside him; like he'd locked away an essential part of himself.  
  
Elena was a reminder of the world he could have had, the road not taken. Her fiery soul reignited memories of the person he used to be before familial obligations snuffed out his ambitions. He envied her devotion to her heart, despite his logical side warning of foolishness.  
  
These silent longings and hidden goals now formed a barrier between them, an unseen gap in understanding. Javier swallowed tightly as they walked, wishing there was some way to bridge the divide.  
  
Elena walked slowly beside Javier, her shoulders slumped in defeat. She could sense the chasm widening between them with each passing day.  
Where once they shared dreams of exploring the world hand in hand, now all she felt was the weight of expectations - his and hers.  
  
She thought back to her last heated argument with her parents, when she'd told them of her plans to go backpacking across South America with Javier.  
  
""Don't be ridiculous,"" her mother had scoffed. ""You have responsibilities here, a career, a life. You can't just run off on some fool adventure.""  
  
Her father had chimed in too, dismissing it as youthful fancy. ""You're nearly 30, Elena. Time to grow up and make something of yourself. That boy you're with, he's got no ambition, no drive. You deserve better. There is better out there.""  
  
Their words had cut deeply. She'd always been the black sheep, the free spirit building castles in the clouds. They wanted her to be sensible, predictable. To settle down and live an ordinary life close to home.  
  
Part of her wondered if they were right. Maybe she was being naive, impractical. But a bigger part stubbornly clung to her ideals, even if it drove a wedge between her and the man she loved.  
  
""Why can't we make our own path?"" she said softly; something cracked through her voice. She stopped walking and turned to Javier, eyes glistening. ""Why do we have to live the lives others expect of us?""  
  
Javier sighed, his shoulders slumping slightly. He reached for her hand, his thumb gently caressing her skin.  
  
""I know, mi amor,"" he said quietly. ""I want those things too - to see the world with you, make our own way.""  
  
He glanced down, hesitating. ""But we have to think about the future. Saving money, having stability. My job pays well, and your family is right - I should try to advance, get promoted.""  
  
Elena pulled her hand back, stung. ""So you're giving up, then? You don't even care?""  
  
Javier shook his head. ""No, that's not what I mean. I just think we need to be practical.""  
  
""Practical,"" Elena repeated dully. She turned away, arms crossed protectively over her chest.  
  
Over Javier's shoulder, she watched a small child happily building a lopsided sandcastle, his family passing around slices of watermelon, giggling as the waves lapped at the edges. A vendor strolled by, pushing a brightly colored cart filled with ice cream bars and frozen fruit pops. The distant shouts of a beach football game carried on the breeze.  
  
Life, joy and freedom surrounded them. Yet Elena had never felt more trapped.  
  
A sudden shriek pierced the air, startling the seagull from its reverie. Its wings snapped open in surprise as it banked sharply, gaining altitude. Heads turned towards the source - a young boy who had just discovered a hermit crab emerging from its shell. His delight quickly turned to alarm at the sight of the tiny creature.  
  
From its growing height, the seagull observed the panorama of the beach and its visitors. The once-clear details blurred into patches of color - umbrellas like flowers, blankets like scattered petals. The edges of the beach faded into the expanse of blue as the seagull rose higher still, riding the ocean breezes. It cast one last look down at the couple on the sand. With a cry, the bird wheeled east, leaving behind the bustle of the beach. As the bird soared over the highrises lining the beach, the sounds of the shore faded into the background hum of traffic and city life. The seagull's keen eyes spotted slivers of ocean visible between buildings, tempting it to veer westward. But some innate sense kept it on its northerly course, over the urban maze of the city. With a flap of its wings, the seagull caught an upward draft and soared through the salty air.  
  
""¡Ándale, ándale!"" shouted the vendedores, beckoning for customers to browse their wares. ""¡Venga! ¡Mire aquí!""  
  
As the seagull flew over the bustling marketplace, a kaleidoscope of colors shimmered below. The seaside air was filled with the aroma of empanadas de mariscos and choritos a la chalaca, drawing hungry patrons from every corner. The bird swooped lower and perched atop the terra cotta rooftop of a stall, which offered him a panoramic view of the market teeming with life and color.  
  
From his new vantage point, the seagull observed the myriad of transactions unfolding before him. He saw the smiling faces of abuelas as they purchased verduras frescas from their favorite vendors, the eager hands of children gripping bolsas de maní con miel, and the captivated stares of young lovers as they admired the intricate designs of tejidos artesanales.  
  
""¡Rápido, rápidito! There is no time to lose!"" the seagull could hear a vendor shouting nearby.  
His eyes followed the commotion - a group of children chasing a stray dog that weaved through the stalls, effortlessly avoiding the playful pursuit. And just like that, amid the laughter and excitement, the seagull found himself immersed in the beautiful chaos of the mercado.  
  
The seagull, perched atop a rooftop, blinked slowly as it surveyed the vibrant tapestry of the marketplace below. The stalls exhibited a cornucopia of colors, textures, and flavors, each one a tribute to the bounty of Chile's fertile lands. Here, plump tomates glistened like rubies in the sun; there, heaps of fragrant ajíes captivated the senses with their heady scent. Crates overflowed with earthy papas and choclos, their golden kernels promising mouthfuls of comfort.  
  
Everywhere, the air was filled with the unmistakable aroma of fresh pan amasado, wafting from the depths of the market.  
  
""¡Amiga! ¿Cuánto por una docena de empanadas?"" a woman called out, her voice a harmony of warmth and familiarity.  
  
""¡Hola, comadre! Para ti, sólo cinco mil pesos,"" replied another, laughter bubbling beneath her words.  
  
As the seagull cocked its head, the cacophony of human voices swelled around him. Buyers haggled fiercely over prices, their words interwoven with affectionate nicknames and inside jokes. Amidst the spirited negotiations, a street performer's cry punctuated the symphony of chatter: ""¡Atención, damas y caballeros! Come see the greatest show in town! He twirled his colorful diabolo high into the air, eliciting gasps of delight from onlookers.  
  
""Oh, that man always up to his tricks!"" an old man chuckled, shaking his head gently.  
  
""And why not? Life is un juego, right?"" his wife remarked as she patted his arm, a mischievous glint in her eye.  
  
In one corner of the square, the melancholic chords of a street performer's guitarra melded with the husky timbre of his voice. “...Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto…. Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto…” As he sang, couples swayed to the music, their hands clasped together in a moment of shared connection.  
  
The seagull, perched atop its vantage point, absorbed the cacophony of sights, sounds, and scents with an insatiable curiosity. The market was a living, breathing entity—and any entity would leave scraps behind to eat.  
  
""¡Cuidado con ese perro!"" a woman cried out suddenly, her voice cutting through the din as a stray dog darted between stalls, pursued by a gaggle of boisterous children. Their laughter rang through the air like church bells.  
  
""¡Vamos, niños! We can't stay all day!"" a mother playfully scolded her children, prompting them to abandon their game of tag and hurry towards their next destination.  
  
The seagull, still perched on high, found himself drawn to the stalls laden with traditional crafts. There, vibrant cuerinas adorned with intricate Mapuche designs danced in the breeze, while polished mate gourds boasted delicate silver filigree. Arrayed alongside them, rows of lapis lazuli earrings and necklaces shimmered like the deep, crystalline waters of the Pacific. Amidst this feast for the senses, one item stood out like a beacon, drawing the eye and stirring the heart: an elegant lapis lazuli necklace, its deep blue stones set against a delicate silver chain that seemed to shimmer with the magic of the stars themselves.  
  
""¡Mira, Juanita!"" exclaimed a woman, her fingers lightly grazing the lustrous surface of the necklace, ""Isn’t it wonderful?""  
  
""Es verdaderamente hermoso"" agreed her husband, his eyes shining with admiration. ""Rodrigo, ¿cuánto cuesta esta joya?""  
  
""Son treinta tres mil pesos."" replied Rodrigo, his voice filled with pride for the craftsmanship that had birthed such a treasure. ""Está hecho con lapislázuli de la mejor calidad"" he added, eager to share the story of the precious stones that had been so lovingly crafted into a piece of wearable art.  
  
The couple exchanged glances, their faces a mixture of longing and hesitation.   
  
""Lo pensaremos"" murmured the woman, her gaze lingering on the necklace just a moment longer before turning away.  
  
""I understand,"" nodded Rodrigo, his smile tinged with a hint of melancholy as he returned the lapis lazuli to its place of honor among the other treasures.  
  
As the late morning sun rose higher and higher in the sky, casting shorter across the bustling market, the seagull spread his wings and took flight once more over the plaza filled with the music of haggling, laughter, and the timeless rhythm of humanity. The seagull watched with a discerning eye as the enticingly fragrant scraps of food fell to the ground. An empanada, glistening with oil and spices, held in fingers to small to hold it, tumbled towards the grimy cobblestones and its prize. With a caw of victory the bird dove down through the air and landed next to the morsel of food. It observed a figure slowly making her way through the throngs of people.  
  
Señora Marta moved through the market stalls with confidence, a basket in one hand and white handkerchief clutched in the other. Her silver hair was tied back tightly in a bun and her dark eyes scanned each corner of the market with experience. She wore her traditional black skirt and shawl, an outfit she had been wearing for years, and navigated each stall without hesitation. The vendors all nodded approvingly or exchanged knowing glances at her presence; they respected her for being able to recognize quality. Everywhere she went, dignity and respect followed, just as it had for generations before her.  
  
She smiled as she passed a stall overflowing with produce: red tomatoes beamed like rubies in the afternoon sun, while oranges gleamed like little moons. Choosing one, she tested its firmness before deciding it was satisfactory and paying the vendor with ease. Momentarily stopping to admire a blue necklace glinting from another stall, she walked towards it, her sandals clacking against the cobblestone walkway. Rodrigo, the young merchant tending to the stand, stood tall and proud awaiting her arrival. When she got closer, she was entranced by its deep lapis lazuli color - it sparkled like the ocean under a full moon.  
  
He reached up, carefully pulled the necklace from its display, and cradled it in his hands like a fragile bird. His eyes sparkled with anticipation as Señora Marta lightly touched the smooth lapis stones and ran her fingers over each intricate silver filigree.  
  
“Rodrigo, ¿Y el descuento? You haven’t forgotten,” the elderly woman asked.  
  
The young man looked at her tenderly and smiled. “Señora Marta, recuerde que siempre le guardo lo mejor para usted.” He handed her the delicate necklace and gestured to its impeccable craftsmanship. “El collar cuesta treinta mil pesos señora. Es una obra de arte única, trabajada a mano por un artesano local.”  
  
""Treinta mil?"" Señora Marta's brows furrowed, and she shook her head disapprovingly. ""En mis tiempos, estas cosas eran mucho más baratas. No puedes esperar que pague tanto por esto.""  
  
“Treinta mil? Estás loco, Rodrigo."" Señora Marta's brows furrowed, and she shook her head disapprovingly. ""In my time, such beautiful things were much more affordable. You can't expect me to pay this much for this.""  
  
“I understand, ma'am, but times have changed,"" Rodrigo said in a calm tone, bracing himself for another round of debate. ""The cost of living has gone up, and the craftsmanship deserves to be valued. Parts, materials... everything is just more expensive.""  
  
The old woman gave an uncaring toss of the piece back onto the table. The lapis lay amidst the silver trinkets, bits of the sea lost under treasure. ""I can't justify spending that much on something so frivolous."" Señora Marta made a show of turning to leave, her basket clutched firmly in her hand.""Que vergüenza por intentar engañarme.""  
  
Rodrigo bit his tongue. It was always the older ones that would play the hard game and try to bargain. ""Señora, ¡sea razonable! The market has changed. We have to cater to the tourists too. They are the ones who are willing to pay these prices.”  
  
“It's always the same excuse,"" Señora Marta scoffed, her words as sharp as sea rocks.   
  
""Everything is so expensive now. It’s all for the tourists now, not for us locales.""  
  
“Madam, I know tradition is key here, but we must also adjust to changing times,"" Rodrigo argued back, wavering under her penetrating stare. ""I can lower the price a bit for you, but it won't be what it used to be. ""  
  
""Then what do you propose?"" Señora Marta challenged.  
  
""How about twenty-eight thousand pesos?"" Rodrigo offered tentatively.  
  
Señora Marta sighed in disappointment, her glumness settling over her like a blanket of fog. ""Still too expensive,"" she murmured. ""That's far more than I'm willing to pay for something that should be cheaper.""  
  
Rodrigo shook his head sadly. ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't lower it any further,"" he replied meekly.  
  
But Señora Marta wasn't ready to let it go. She fixed him with an icy gaze and accused, “So, you forget about us? The people who have been coming here for years? It’s like you’re turning your back on your own people.”  
  
""Madam, it is not my intention to disrespect anyone,"" Rodrigo responded, his resolve trembling like the delicate petals of the copihue flower. ""But I also have responsibilities: a wife, children to support. I can't afford to give away my job.""  
  
Señora Marta eyed Rodrigo with contempt, her gaze like two sharp blades.  
  
""I've had responsibilities too, young man,"" she said firmly, her eyes narrowing. ""I raised four children alone after my husband left us. I've always found a way to do that and stay true to el vecindario.""  
  
Rodrigo shook his head. ""No, Señora, it's not like that. We respect our local culture, but we also need to adapt. The costs are rising here and tourists help keep the businesses alive.""  
  
Señora Marta scoffed. ""Adapt? Adapt? That's all I hear these days. Another hotel here, another apartment block over there - What about our traditions and values? You're just selling out!""  
  
Rodrigo held his hands up in frustration. ""We're not selling out ma'am. We're trying to survive - I have a family to feed and the reality is that tourism keeps our market vibrant.""  
  
Señora Marta huffed angrily. ""Vibrant? This doesn't even feel like the same place anymore; it's become something of a circus for outsiders! You've lost all of the essence that made this place special!""  
  
""Lo entiendo, señora,"" Rodrigo murmured, his thoughts drifting to his own pequeños waiting for him at home. They were young now, but how would they remember the place of their childhood in a world that seemed to slip further away from memory with each passing day? ""But I cannot do anything about it,"" Rodrigo countered softly, ""Sometimes we are forced to change to survive.""  
  
“Survival? Es avaricia y estás cegado por ella. And you know what, Rodrigo? I'll take my money elsewhere – somewhere where loyalty still means something,” she spat angrily. “This mercado used to be a place of community. Now it's just another tourist trap. ”  
  
“I'm not blinded, Señora. I'm being realistic. The world is changing, and we have to change with it.”  
  
""The world is changing, Rodrigo, and not always for the better,"" Señora Marta said quietly, the fire in her eyes fading to a gentle ember. ""Sometimes, clinging to old ways is the only way to maintain our identity. There are things we shouldn't sacrifice for pesos."" she answered, her voice trembling with conflicting emotions of both pride and pain. The past seemed to hang in the air for a moment, evoking images of a time that was both cherished and despaired.  
  
""Perhaps we have different opinions on what is worth sacrificing, ma'am,"" Rodrigo suggested, his heart reaching out for the harmony of the market's past.  
  
Señora Marta shook her head, sadness creeping into the wrinkles that framed her eyes. ""I don't think we'll ever agree, young man.""  
  
""Maybe not,"" Rodrigo agreed, his voice laced with a resigned sigh.  
  
Señora Marta's steps grew heavier as she turned away from Rodrigo's stall, her woven espadrilles clacking on the cobblestone alley. Unseen spirits seemed to hang in the air, and the stalls around her appeared muted and dull in comparison to their usual vibrant colors and lively chatter. As she looked around, she saw merchants that she remembered young now as lined as her, or simply gone forever, replaced by their children and grandchildren how running the family stalls. She could no longer make out the laughter of children playing nearby, only a faint whisper that barely reached her ears.  
  
She released a slow sigh as she quietly mouthed “Qué lástima”, the words almost inaudible over the noisy haggling and bartering. When she turned her head to glance back at Rodrigo, he scowled and fixed his eyes on the ground. His fists were clenched so tightly together that his knuckles had gone white and his jaw was tense; yet seeing a group of Americans, he pasted a smile on his face and motioned for their attention. A sense of grief washed over her as she thought about how much had changed since the bustling marketplace during her childhood years. When had the years gone by so fast?  
  
A sudden burst of energy rippled through the market, as a cacophony of youthful voices erupted in excitement. The seagull tilted its head, observing a group of niños giving chase to a stray dog, their laughter infectious. The dog's tail wagged with delight, weaving in and out of the stalls, barking playfully as it dodged the little hands grasping at its fur.  
  
""¡Cuidado con las cosas en los puestos!"" shouted a vendor, his eyes following the rambunctious scene with a mix of amusement and concern.  
  
""¿Por qué no atrapamos ese perro?"" one child gasped between breaths. Her cheeks flushed from the exhilaration of the chase.  
  
""¡No importa! ¡Es divertido correr!"" replied another, grinning widely as his legs carried him onward.  
  
""¡Vamos, amigos!"" shouted a boy, as he led the pack of children towards the stray dog once more. ""¡Esta vez lo vamos a atrapar!""  
  
And as the stray dog dashed past the cobbles where the seagull perched, the sudden commotion startled the bird from its reverie. It spread its wings wide, feeling the wind catch beneath its feathers like a lover's embrace, lifting it higher and higher into the sky.

He’s jobless. He’s boring.

My intention was to post this to Patreon and simply tuck a link here, but Patreon appears to be down. Okay then. Here’s the double-whammy, and I hope to be fully up to date by Friday! 

&#x200B;

Rob wakes up and summons the courage to wipe the sigh from his eyes, after an exhaustive evening mapping sulk-circles around an adult arcade.

“She won’t even let me impregnatize her,” Rob mopes around his coffee island, wishing Sophie had been courteous enough to pilfer some napkins from the airplane beverage cart. Sophie gives no fucks about Rob’s dad-angst performance, but she accepts a paper cup of instant coffee. 

“I’d give you plastic straws to stir it with, but California is trying to protect sea turtles or some shit,” Rob shrugs. “Now I’m just waiting for you to tell me something about the life you selfishly experienced before you met me.” 

Sophie’s Choice Two: Electric Boogaloo begins with Sophie’s confession:“Medical issues.” 

“What are you scared of?” Rob learned listening skills from 90DF’s fearless host, Shaun. 

“MEDICAL ISSUES,” Sophie tries again.  

“Whoa, what just happened here?” Shaun stops by to demonstrate how interest works. “Okay, I’m nodding…and I’m nodding, and…let’s move on.” 

“I should take notes, but nobody ever has a pencil to loan me when I need one,” Rob robs. 

Sophie asks Rob to explain what about his grow-tent tapestry suggests plans for child-rearing, and Rob calls her bougie for suggesting children’s services might object to horticulture. She details ovarian cyst removal, and adds that mommy bloggers have been over since they started making documentaries about them. Sophie wonders if he’s trying to have kids now, and if so, why he thinks that can be accomplished with no financial stability whatsoever. 

“I don’t want to walk you into a life of making you do things,” Rob just whistles in his head until it’s his turn to talk. “But if you think about it, if we had a kid there would be someone to hold my trunk closed. I’m just saying.”

Sophie notes that he’s still ignoring the part where the concern is pregnancy — not parenthood. She asks if he’s interested in adoption or surrogacy, and he says as long as he doesn’t have to do anything physically or fiscally, it sounds great. This counts as making up to these two, so Sophie calls her mom. 

“I’m really surprised you haven’t talked about this yet,” Mom is as flummoxed as Rob’s sister. “I’m even more surprised that the topic being broached didn’t sterilize you. What do you talk about exactly?” 

“Mostly he asks for nudes then starts wanking,” Sophie explains romance. “Sometimes Rob says things about ‘chasing gold,’ but he didn’t bring a metal detector to the beach. He said it’s supposed to be a pan, and he’s not trying to cook, and either way I’m not being supportive.”

“I’m sorry this relationship is happening,” Mom supports our at-home needs. “I’m sending you some self-esteem patches in the mail. Be sure to put them all over your body.” 

Sophie wants to leave the shed for a night anywhere else, and Rob agrees to take her to a club, but bemoans how expensive they are when your girlfriend won’t ask her parents for money. He makes some calls and manages to isolate one within LA city-limits that recalls an American Legion basement. Rob invites Tarai to prove there’s no one more loyal than a hype man seeking one more cameo, and Sophie invites app-friend Soraya, who bravely bleaches her hair in blonde-Kardashian sisterhood.

Rob stays on brand as he predictably complains about how long Sophie takes to get ready, knowing if she took ten minutes he’d pretend not to know her and ask if she feels sick. With that, they’re off to the club, where Tarai waits to instigate, confident there’s a 0% chance of Rob defending her. 

“So where did you and Soraya meet? On THE APP where I saw your profile, WHILE I WAS LOOKING FOR A DATE?” Tarai didn’t get the swipe he was looking for. 

“Friends is what happens when they don’t ghost and block you,” Soraya suspects Tarai needs coaching. 

“Hang on, is this really a club?” Sophie’s certain she saw someone bowling in the back. “Why is this shot in a tumbler? Why is there a line for vaccines?”

“See? I don’t know about her,” Tarai needs to switch strains.

The crew groans as Rob starts skipping about, a sure sign that he’s about to Timberlake-up this hoedown, and they race to swallow Dramamine before his first boot scoots its way into a TikTok squeak-edit.

“Seasick again,” Camera #2 runs like someone’s about to turn on the House-of-Usher sprinklers.

But wait! The Red Screen of Doom unfurls, warning that Sophie has fled the shed. The crew joins her at the up-to-code AirBNB, and she says she needed a break from the smell of rust, fungus gnats, and outhouse, to find out if there’s a cult deprogramming center that might advise her on ways to elevate her standards from subterranian. She reports that she had a dream that Rob left a long trail of infidelity receipts, so she followed them and they led to Rob sitting on a toilet screeching, “I didn’t do anything!” When she woke up she did forensics on his phone, and found many recent deposits in his spank bank.

“All my other accounts are overdrawn!” Rob protests. “I’m not perfect!” 

“I’m just really trying not to think about it,” Sophie wonders how long before one of these wank videos crashes a server on Reddit. “What am I supposed to do now?”

Meanwhile, Rob rebrands recent exchanges with multiple women as “free porn,” that someone(s) sent him unsolicited.

“So you don’t know she looked at your phone and saw multiple messages with multiple women, and you asking questions and sending videos back?” Production is baffled. 

“I do, but I feel like lying is just what I’m about,” Rob robs. “WHY ARE YOU BRINGING THIS UP AGAIN? WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS.”  

“Women are capable of anything…” Tarai can do this all day, all night, because when you’re single you’ve got time. 

Sophie calls her mom, who fulfills her Gen X duties by delivering universal truths with space buns. Mom’s appalled that Sophie dedicated the better part of a year to preparing to camp in LA because Rob wouldn’t come to London, and isn’t surprised he responded to Sophie with making it about himself.

“He’s jobless. He’s boring. He’s got no sympathy…” Sophie’s mom is ONE OF US! ONE OF US!

Sophie wants to believe Rob is a fixer-upper and not a tear-down with a radon leak and a spreading sinkhole, so she hopes there’s some explanation that will carry them into arguments where he demands she stop bringing it up.

Meanwhile, in Moldova (or if you’re Nikki, Russia) Nikki continues to fully lose her shit in a public park, insisting her $7K investment in Igor’s nose counts as putting dick in escrow. Igor explains how weird it is to be in the middle of an argument over dishes when your partner suddenly shouts “I once had a penis!”

“Why is everything always about you?” Nikki robs.

“You don’t even call me my actual name,” Igor is awarded full points for accuracy.

Nikki blames her meltdown on the hormone shot she took prior to departure, and thinks he should be more understanding about this since she’s the one who exists.

“The Nikki can blame hormones for this angry, yes, but if I also say hormones for my sex, I owe her $7,000,” Igor struggles to keep up, but he can just skip to it being his fault and save time. 

“This is where you sit back and enjoy,” Manuel knows how to trickster it up. 

Nikki can’t believe it’s been 24 hours, and declares if she doesn’t spend the next 12 hours biting the mattress while Igor works off his debt, she’s going to the airport.

“Really? You are leaving tomorrow?” Igor thinks they might find a flight tonight if she gives her hustle some muscle.

“Of course not!” Nikki thinks Igor should know that her saying she’s leaving is like Angela saying she’s done. So they flounce back to his apartment so she can be angry some more. 

“You remember those men playing chess in park, yes?” Igor asks production. “Well, this is surprise for you: They are also 35. Their essence has been already drained by The Nikki, and then injected in face or ass.”

“I…am…still…emperor!” Nikki skeksis. 

Mom’s been putting Nikki in time-out since she was a little asshole and not a big one, so when Nikki calls she’s ready to bat for Team Igor.

“Did you keep things civil, or did you immediately meltdown over a minor inconvenience?” Mom’s an accomplished reader. 

“It’s very hard with a very cold Russian,” Nikki actually says. 

“Okay, we’ve already talked about maps, honey,” Mom’s exhausted. “Find another way to speak to him.”

Nikki calms down and agrees to forgive Igor for the nothing he’s done, so he takes her out to dinner in public and agrees to sit at the same table with her the entire time. The restaurant is full of people, and for The Nikki that means a fleet of extras whispering about the star.

“They just clocked me,” Nikki narfs.

“As an American?” Igor asks. “It is the English.” 

“She made the grandpas in the park,” the table in question whispers. “Hide the podlings…”

Igor reassures Nikki that he has her back, and after they leave the restaurant he does his dick duty. If you think that means Nikki’s complaint file is empty, remember that she could barely wrangle her bags. She’s moved on to his reluctance to go down on her, which is hard to parse when you’re ignoring another person’s trauma.

“Why don’t you find a professional sex person?” Igor has solutions.

“Because then I would have to complain that they’re not romantic,” Nikki rolls her eyes.“I’m still horny from the hormone shot!”

“Maybe next time you read prescription, yes?” Igor tries to help. “And also follow instruction.”

Somehow Igor makes his escape, and promises to take her to the gym with him, as soon as he finds one that will respond to her when she starts speaking English like everyone does. 

“What does he mean by that?” Nikki turns to a local who looks at her blankly. 

Igor arranges a meet-the-friends dinner with Roksy, Sergei (the chess friend), Ivan, and Sasha, and hopes the BMW they arrive in explains why he’s okay with being called Justin. All parties have been briefed on Nikki being trans, and Igor waves his straw at Nikki, and she sucks it before confessing her gender reveal party for two. Roksy seems shocked and asks if he couldn’t handle it, and Igor admits it was a struggle, so Nikki moves fast to reroute this back to herself.

“I lived on the street, I was addicted to drugs, I had to prostitute myself,” Nikki likes lists. 

“What?” Rocksy needs a third sweater. 

“I just want them to understand the reasons Justin chose me,” Nikki narfs. 

“What?” Roksy speaks for everyone. 

Igor tells production that he respects her past life, and isn’t bothered by her sharing, since he’d like to focus on the healthy future. Roksy empathizes with the struggles Nikki experienced, and how judgment and isolation might make her reluctant to share her transition. She also empathizes with Igor, and the challenges he faces living in a conservative country that might isolate him with violence. 

Nikki thinks this sounds dangerously close to acknowledging Igor’s experience and Having a Moment, so she hustles Roksy to the bar to vomit outrage that Igor’s not the fuck-monkey she was promised. 

“Yes, men go down on women here,” Roksy nods. “Do you think this is because —“

“Thank you, I’m glad we both agree I’m unsatisfied,” Nikki exhales. 

Things are equally strange back at the table, where Ivan makes a truly fucked up joke that they’ll talk about Ukrainian girls while they’re gone, which explains why Moldova never comes up when Yara ponders relocation plans. Ivan asks about whether Nikki has a penis and/or acts like a man, and Igor reports she’s a sex machine with a controlling nature, and sometimes the way she slams his face into her clavicle derails his blooming boner. 

“For fuck’s sake, release the guinea pig footage,” Production is fighting casting.

Clayton is a guinea pig papa and IT guy from Lexington, KY, and the miracle of online shopping granted access to a fetching firetruck outfit for brave little flame stomper Baby Pig on his birthday. 

“You’re such a pretty pig,” Clayton announces, holding up Baby Pig to celebrate his passion for fashion. Guinea Pig #2, Chocolate, doesn’t share Baby’s outfit enthusiasm, and is sentenced to a sad beret. 

“This is two steps away from pancake,” Chocolate knows where this is headed. 

“When they’re hungry, they make a noise like wheek-wheek! And when they’re feeling dominant, they purr. Like whurrr.” Okay, Clayton, go on. 

His one bedroom apartment also hosts two chihuahas, Cocoa and Buster, who choose violence and menace the crew with bared teeth and growls.

“Isn’t he a cute little RUN! RUN! RUN!” the gaffer clotheslines himself with a boom mike in his haste to escape. 

Clayton’s lady-love is Anali (26), and these two met on a language-learning app, hit it off, and then he took off to Peru to meet her. Four days into their developing romance he knew it was the right time to propose, and after a long pause she agreed.

“I did get the yes in the end, so I’m hoping it was not coerced or forced,” Clayton’s kinda endearing, and better not turn into Mike.  

Anali has kept their relationship in the closet to family and friends, which is going to have to change once she arrives, because that’s where Clayton stores his mom. Mom set up camp the day Clayton thought he was leaving home, and Clayton reports she’s been saving for a place of her own for three years, with an unfortunate recreational hoarding issue standing in the way of progress.

Mom’s clutter bounty includes a cork collection, plastic cups, and a two-years expired granola bar, and if her brain were wired slightly differently she might accelerate towards rebranding these art supplies and defend them within an inch of her life. Instead, she wears the facial expression of someone who knows it doesn’t make sense to most people, but logic is an insufficient tonic for anxiety. 

Clayton’s pretty compassionate, and understands that she’s lost a lot, and is clinging to what she still has. (Note: I’ve found that saying “you need to make room for the future” feels warmer than requests to let things go.) Mom agrees to take some of her living room piles to off-site storage, and when they arrive the unit is stocked to the ceiling. Mom is embarrassed, but Clayton makes a point to not humiliate her, and dashes off to take a call from Anali, wagging his invisible tail at her pending arrival. 

Clayton says the hoarding situation and lack of privacy has left him a hermit in his room, but it could just as easily be argued that Clayton uses mom as an excuse to remain chained to the video games that have comforted him for years. It’s also worth nothing that this place is small, and it’s unclear where mom would put the basic things she needs to live if they weren’t stacked in containers in the living room. 

“Inertia is the theme this season,” the clever editors are really proud of themselves. 

Clayton’s BFF of 13 years is Kameron, and they’ve never met or hung out in person, which makes both feel better prepared for an AI dominated future. 

“I might be asking for video game assistance, but I’m still delivering more maturity than cast members with in-person pals,” Kameron doesn’t risk invoking Tarai by saying his name.

Clayton tells Kameron that Anali’s close with her dad, who calls her 20 times a day, and in those 20 daily phone calls she’s never once brought up her fiancé. Kameron seems stunned to learn that to Anali, closeness means total secrecy, and asks if Clayton’s sure the man calling isn’t a parole officer or something. Clayton adds that during his visits she tells him she going out of town for work, and this looming relocation has been framed as a job in Kentucky. 

“Who moves to Kentucky for jobs? Coal miners?” Kameron scans his mind for the right movie. 

Arrival day! Clayton shows off clothing and mugs emblazoned with their likeness, in case people wonder why they’re standing next to each other, and he’s got a parade-float of flowers and a stuffed llama to welcome her. He opts to bring all of these things to the airport, and soon enough she’s coming down the escalator for a happy reunion. Clayton is in tears, and Anali thinks it’s cute, and they enjoy a sweet moment we should probably clock with suspicion. 

Clayton leads her up the stairs to his apartment, and Anali stands in the doorway in bewilderment, taking in the fleet of animal cages and plastic containers. Mom emerges from the kitchen, eager to test out the Spanish she’s been studying in the closet in the quiet voice Clayton recommended. 

“Te amo,” Mom whispers, and the guinea pigs quickly run backwards to thwart Mike’s arrival. 

Anali seems stunned by this greeting, and notes the guinea pigs have a condo-cage but there’s no place to sit or eat. She says that her house in Peru is big, but couples starting out always begin at nothing, so she can’t demand more from him until she has her relationship tshirt on.

“I’ve got low expectations for intimacy the first night,” Clayton’s a man of reason. “I’ve heard people require 48 hours for post-flight adjustment, and that demanding unrestricted access to unwashed genitals could be construed as coersion or force.” 

“LICK MY FACE! LICK IT!” Nikki stops by. 

Sure enough, when Anali emerges in their team clothing she shoos him to the other side of the bed, and uses his stuffed panda as a bed divider so its beady eyes can monitor the traffic on the ceiling while they slumber. That means Clayton’s closing out night one with a love deficiency, but hopes his puppy eyes and pouting gets her hot and bothered for their humping future.

“Yes, I am babysitter Jasmine, and it’s time to suckle…” Jasmine has a kink for that. 

Speaking of Jasmine, she wakes up in Michigan covered in rashes, and tells Gino his house is too dirty, so they need to burn it down and buy a new one. Gino counters that she’s already injected closing-costs into her ass, so perhaps she should take a closer look at the ingredients of the almonds she’s been snacking on instead. 

“I am not allergic to almonds!” Jasmine snaps. 

“What about, let’s see, natural flavors? Sea salt?” Gino can’t fathom the biohazard bathroom comes with consequences, and reminds her that she once had mice somewhere in her $3K a month apartment.

“What mice, you fucking idiot?” Jasmine lets out trapped heat so her skin clears. 

After more arguing Gino agrees to buy his way out of it, which involves a hasty trip to the nearest something-mart for the knock-off equivalent of a $100 pillow, and in the middle of aisle what Jasmine remembers that this is her Mother of the Year season.

“I am weeping over being separated from my lambs,” Jasmine cries. “If only Gino kept his job, this dream would be within reach.”

“Sure, they’ll be here any second,” Gino deletes his LinkedIn profile, and agrees to call Juance from the aisles. 

“We will get soccer balls for your room!” Jasmine SomethingMarts. 

“Put everything in the cart, I’m ready!” We’re all ready, Juance. 

It’s time for Jasmine to meet Team Hat, despite their lukewarm interest in her, and the minor conflicts she’s poked prior to arrival.

“I don’t know if I want to be in the same place as them when they start with the plans to take the governor hostage again,” Jasmine has a few concerns.

“It was only the one time,” Gino protests. 

“I feel like a cow going to the butchery.” 

“They don’t have the proper equipment for that,” Gino wishes she hadn’t made him think of cutting boards in the car.

The chosen venue is some kind of food court bocci ball hangout, and Jasmine greets everyone pleasantly, and shares that she’s eager to demonstrate her skill at banging balls. Gino’s brother Tony and his wife Laura consider these two a bit of a “mixed-matched” couple, since they don’t have the visual coherency of a woven cowboy hat paired with an American flag mourning shirt that lived a former life as a velvet tapestry. 

Dana’s wife is ready to present friend vibes, and supports Jasmine’s high-octane journey to citizenship with a metronome hug. Meanwhile, Gino announces Jasmine re-routed wedding dress cash to her ass, which makes the men-folk paranoid that she might be using Gino for his coin collection.

“We really expect a beautiful foreign woman to love Gino for his nude-sharing,” Uncle Grandpa narfs. 

The fam sits down to quiz Jasmine about her intentions, as one does. 

“How will you contribute to American society,” Captain Civics, reporting for Murica. 

“First of all, I will keep Gino contained indoors with no ability to send unsolicited dick pics to strangers,” Jasmine’s already swamped by her first assignment. “Second, a K1 visa means I can’t legally work, which is not a condition impeding Gino, who isn’t working all the same. Let’s play guess why he got fired!” 

“But you don’t even seem grateful,” Cousin Windup grabs for the talking ball.

“That is because I gave up my entire life to be here, in Michigan. Where I am cold,” Jasmine could use some backup about now, and thankfully Gino comes alert in time for the prenup blather. 

“My dad wanted a prenup,” Mixed-Match chimes in. “He saw the cowboy hat and said, ‘He might find your bank account while looking for the range!’ Then Tony said, ‘it’s in the kitchen,’ so I called a lawyer.” 

“You see? That I understand,” Jasmine would like to leave now. 

Jasmine says that now that she’s met all of them, she’d like to keep their wedding small, and just go to the courthouse with Gino. The family doesn’t think that’s taking Gino into consideration, but Jasmine assures them that he is invited, it’s just all of them that have to stay home. 

Somehow Jasmine soldiers through this a champ, keeping her temper contained until they reach the safety of Gino’s car. Then she finds lipgloss on the floor, and the color reminds her of war.

“FASTFORWARD NOW!” Jasmine screams and cries, and everyone at home answers the call. 

You might recall Nick previously boasted bed-breaking ambitions, which were handily rerouted by Devin’s open-mouthed chewing, and his own recreational farting. They go out for food, and Nick coaches Devin through the pending parent introduction. He suggests she look down when drinking or chewing her food so no one vomits, and Devin wonders if that means he’ll wait to start a sentence until after he swallows. 

“Of course not,” Nick sprays her with meat juice.

Devin brought everything from her earth-toned adjunct professor wardrobe, and asks Nick for assistance selecting something to wow the ‘rents. Nick wonders why she thinks that can be found in these suitcases, and stuffs a few floral prints down the toilet before they cover the tables. From there they take a smog tour, and Nick’s pep talk soldiers on, as he describes his father as unfriendly and his mom as a serious career woman, and since Devin’s a crybaby, Jihoon would call this whole thing fucked.

“Have you ever complimented anyone?” Production demands to know. 

“Piggy isn’t a compliment?” Nick’s lost.

After greeting everyone mom helps Devin with a lipstick-on-teeth issue, and Devin assures her that’s just her gums, and Nick’s sister looks grateful marriage plans involve relocation overseas. They ask what the living situation will be, and Nick reports they’re going to live with her parents for a year, and then he’s going to escape Searcy like the walls are closing in and fire is behind them. Mom admits she’ll miss Nick, but not so much that she’ll be making plans to visit, which pulls Devin’s guilt lever and unleashes a trickle of tears. 

This turns out to be a winning move, since acknowledgement of difficulties means Devin’s at least aware that other people exist. Mom calms her down, and assures Devin that she supports their union, and understands Nick is an adult capable of regretting his move to Arkansas like everyone else. They wish them a happy marriage, and everyone claps.  

“Did something happen?” Camera #2 loses time. 

“Goodbye! Goodbye!” Nick’s family has no idea how long they need to wave for this scene. “Goodbye still! Goodbye some more!” 

“Seriously, what happened,” Camera #2 still needs answers.

Manuel’s been in Rochester for seven whole days, and Ashley’s pleasant disposition can only mean arguing paused long enough for fucking. Manuel knows dickmatizing her is the only way he’s going to survive 90 Days of Night, but Ashley rebrands this as a magical act, because no one else has free will that can’t be bent.  

“SEE! How hard is that?” The Nikki knows what a functional relationshit looks like. 

“We manifest everything in our lives. Every single thing,” Ashley actually says. 

“Mangos on the beach,” Danielle nods in divorce.

“Every time you call, I answer!” Chaos appears with its oops-wand at the ready. 

They head to a bar called Spirit Room (narf!) and Ashley’s a bit worried about the friend-intro, since she talks a lot of shit, and that means she manifested judgment that isn’t her fault. Everyone exchanges greetings, and someone asks if he’s ready for marriage, and he reports 80%, because if he says 100% Ashley will find a new problem.

“We have a lot to unpack around the witch thing,” Ashley plays at having some upper hand. “He laughed. He couldn’t even handle it!”

“That’s why she chose me,” Manuel knows.

“He’s very controlling,” the friends nod into the what. 

Somehow this relationship has only been happening for 18 days, which means it’s time for couples’ therapy? Ashley finds a bilingual one so she can speak English while the therapist translates, thus making every point twice. The therapist stares at them both like a 3D print in a shopping mall until they merge into an emotional sailboat.

“When Manuel’s not listening, I feel like I’m not being heard,” Ashley says. 

“What?” Thank you, Roksy. 

Manuel says Ashley speaks in a way where she’s accusing him of something before he’s had the chance to act, which is different from asking questions and showing curiosity about his private life. Ashley counters that he watches tv while she’s yelling and just turns up the volume.  

“I just sit back and enjoy,” Manuel and Chaos are well acquainted.

The therapist suggests that both parties need to commit to making it work for progress to happen, which probably means sharing more details of his life with Ashley, and Ashley responding to these details with a calmer demeanor. Ashley agrees to tone it down, and Manuel agrees that she said things, and he’s going to need to drop his pants in the car or she’s going to say everything again on the way home.

Waking up, I felt the warmth of papa’s body. Looking around I saw that we were in the same strange building that the demon clad in silver metal had put us in. But we weren’t alone, as in the end of the building I could see a sack of sorts where another smaller demon slept.

Surprisingly it did not make any noise whatsoever and if I didn’t see it go to sleep there yesterday, I wouldn’t even have noticed that it was there.

Curiosity began to swell in my mind as I questioned myself how the creature looked under all those strange robes. Slipping out of papa’s embrace, I made my way slowly towards the creature.

Eventually I could see it clearly. It wore strange clothes and a mask of some sorts that only revealed a pair of closed eyes.

Suddenly the demon moved at blinding speeds and grabbed my throat with its left arm in one swift move. The demon’s eyes shot open as it stood up from its slumber.

I tried to make a sound to alert papa, but the creature grabbed my throat too tight to allow any air to come or go through it. Panic began building fast in me as I thrashed around in hopes of getting a bit of air.

Tears began flowing through my eyes as my ears began ringing due to the lack of air…. Untill it finally realeased me and my but collapsed to the ground as gasps of air began flowing through my mouth as I hyperventilated.

My gasps apparently woke up papa, as I saw him crawling to me.

I also saw it, standing over me as it inspected the hand that it used to choke me.

Thanks to my peripheral view I saw two more demons enter the building, both were clad in strange robes with metal covering everything and in their arms they held strange objects. But surprisingly before they did anything, they were stopped by the small demon who showed its palm to them.

They were discussing something, even if the small demon never spoke, the other two seemed to understand it. Afraid of what I had caused, I grabbed papa’s fur tightly and hid my head in his chest, soon I began feeling the comforting arms of papa around me.

Slowly, my hearing began returning, allowing me to hear the noise of metal against metal leaving the room. Soon we were alone against the white-masked demon.

“*I beg you, please feed on me and leave her alone*!” Papa pleaded with the demon.

The only response he got was the stomach of the demon growling hungrily at the opportunity of eating us.

Looking at the demon she was shaking her head while she walked away. It walked up to a table where I could see a bowl full of food. It began inspecting some of the strange fruits before sitting at the table itself.

With one of her hands it pointed at one of the chairs nearby. Slowly papa stood up with me in his arms before sitting in the chair she was ponting, after that, It grabbed one of the plants, it was completely green with white stripes around, and the size of our heads! It grabbed it before stabbing in it with the long knife it had on its waist, after that it began cutting some pieces revealing a watery red inside.

My mouth began watering at the idea of eating such fruit, so when it extended its hand with a piece of said fruit, I immediately grabbed it, unfortunately before I could dig in, papa took the fruit out of my hands.

“This is poisoned isn’t it, I have seen it before.” He stated while glaring daggers to the demon who had started to cut another piece but stopped and looked at papa directly.

It laughed slightly as it began to take off his face and head protectors. First the hood revealed long fur that had been tied at the back of its head, then the mask revealed a complete bald face, it had brown predatory eyes and what looked like burn marks all along her cheeks and neck, although I couldn’t see more as it was hidden under the robes it was wearing.

“I will not eat poisoned food.” Papa said, but before he could drop the only food we had in a day, the demon grabbed his hand and approached his jaws to papa’s paw. I expected papa’s paw to be consumed by the demon, but instead, it… took a bite of the fruit? The center of it to be specific.

Papa was as confused as I was, as we had clearly seen predatory fangs as it bit the fruit. After that, it stood up and with a loud gulp and visible bulge going down its throat past its collarbone we finally snapped out of our shock.

The demon walked again to the original fruit before taking a piece for itself and another one for us. It began then to happily chew and gulp down more of the fruit piece it had.

“Y-You are a predator.” Papa muttered, getting only a nod from the demon as its legs began moving in the air like I did when I got bored.

“Are you eating fruits?” Papa asked again, getting yet again another nod from it as it’s  stomach growled again impatiently.

“How?!” Papa asked, causing the demon to tilt its head to a side while placing a finger in her cheek. Eventually it just shrugged her shoulders as it continued digging into its food.

Papa looked at the fruit before taking a bite, and after some moments he lowered the fruit piece allowing me to eat.

“Sweet!” I almost screamed as I began chewing and swallowing faster than papa. Eventually we had finished the first piece and began eating the second one, this time though, papa snapped the piece in half.

Eventually we had finished eating and we looked expectantly at the demon who was staring with wide eyes at us as it left the hard part of the fruit on the table.

“Moar!” I pleaded.

“Nuili stop!” Papa spoke quickly, but before I could get reprimanded more, the demon started cutting the fruit in more pieces with ease, leaving 2 more for us and the remaining piece for itself.

“Thank you” I said with my tail wagging. I don’t know what this thing is, but it’s friendly, I probably just spooked it earlier as it slept. “Why don’t you talk? Do you know how to talk?” I asked. The creature simply tapped its throat.

“Your throat hurts?” Papa asked which got another nod from the creature.

“Namasa can help you! He is the best doctor I know!” I quickly added, getting another glare from papa.

The creature simply laughed before exposing its wounded and scarred neck, it looked like what all the other cattle had under their collars, especially boy cattle, as they aren’t as important as girl cattle.

I cringed at the memory causing the creature to hide again his neck. That meant these things had been cattle as well! That makes them prey like us right?

“Papa papa is it prey or predator?” I asked, getting a blank stare from it.

“I-I don’t know.” He answered. It began pointing at his chest after some moments of simply blank staring. “Sorry, I don’t understand.” Papa answered.

It then began pointing at me.

“What happens with her?” Papa asked while getting pointed at by It. “I?” Papa asked getting a shake of head from it’s part, once again It began pointing at me, but at the same time at itself

“She?” Papa asked “Are you a she? You are female?” Papa asked, getting several nods from her “Wait, then those are swollen breasts, are you pregnant or you gave birth?!” Papa asked, alarmed knowing how overprotective some moms are.

Fortunately she shook her head. Suddenly our line of thought was interrupted by a voice ranging from outside the tent. The voice was a deep one, revealing the source to be from another predator. The female predator before us changed her facial expression before her face was hidden under the strange mask she wore before she went to the entrance.

When she opened the entrance another figure was revealed. This one was clad in more metal than the female predator, but not so much as the massive predator that had left us here.

“Sofia, te postulo ut me adiuves par…Suntne captivi?” The predator’s eyes locked themselves with us causing a shiver to run up my back.

Fortunately before the predator could do anything, the female predator held her palm to the other one, then she pointed to a strange banner that hung from one of the walls. The banner was rectangular, cut in 4 different squares with black and purple being its colors. On each square there was a symbol, the top left purple square had a golden plant embedded into it, the top right black had a strange white drawing of a four legged animal with a long mane around its neck and a bit of its torso.

“Annei Dominas illas hic reliquit?” The taller predator asked, getting a nod from the female one “Intelligo hic eos ubi sint relinquam. Potesne manum dare?” The female predator gazed at us before nodding at the bigger predator who also nodded before, leaving with the female following swiftly.

Papa and I were left once again alone.

Walking into the medical tent, I mentally checked the well being of the wounded and if they needed help. Fortunately, most wounds had already healed enough so they wouldn’t be life threatening, the only one in a state like that was the…creature, brother Williams took out of their pen, and if that wasn’t enough, now somewhere around half a hundred of them roamed the camp.

Sure, they were always watched by fellow brothers in arms, but that didn’t mean that these things weren’t capable of tearing a grown man in half by just sneezing on him! And of course, I had to take care of one of ‘em.

Walking towards the creature while pushing a cart, he tried to stand, fortunately, he was too weak to do so allowing me to stay at his side without worrying. Grabbing a wooden handle from the cart, I instructed the creature to open his mouth to place said wooden handle in his jaws. I had to do some deep throat inspection to check on why he didn’t eat and I wasn’t risking my hand or head for said knowledge.

The part of the tent we were in had a retractable roof that could be easily pushed away with a long stick or swords allowing the sunlight to flow in.

Grabbing a long metal tool with a small mirror in the end, I began to inspect what I could, but no matter what I checked, I saw no wounds whatsoever deep in the throat of the creature, it was just dry.

Something that I've realized is the lack of breath even with the throat open. Putting my palm over the snout of the creature allowed me to feel the breathing through the nostrils. Sighing, I grabbed a piece of deer that a hunting party had brought. Maybe If I could convince the creature into eating, I could see the problem.

Taking off the wooden handle, I handed the meat piece to the creature. At first, I thought I had to coerce him in some way into eating, but no, the moment I handed the meat to him, he almost swallowed it completely causing me to stare at him dumbfoundedly.

He could eat without any pain, yet he didn’t do It? Religious motives perhaps? By the way he looked at me expectantly made me realize that perhaps there was nothing wrong with him.

“Sister Telma, can you get a ration for this?” I asked a sister who was leaving the tent.

“Sure thing.” She said before leaving the tent. Meanwhile I checked on the malnourished body of the creature. He was tall, maybe a bit shorter than me, but not by much. I could also see some closed wounds, he had some bandages that brother Williams and I had applied yesterday and would have to be changed when he was available.

After some moments where I inspected the body of the creature, sister Telma arrived with a cart that had the leg of a deer on top. Maybe it was a bit too much, but the old woman always brought extra food.

“God bless your soul sister.” I thanked.

“It was nothing brother.” Sister Telma replied before leaving for good to get some rest.

Staring back at the creature I found him drooling as he stared intensely at the meat.

“All yours.” I said as I pushed the cart towards him. The creature grabbed the meat and began eating quickly, tearing pieces with his jaws, not even the bone was left behind. “What a mess.” I stated as I stared at how the bed he was in was now covered in blood. The same could be said for him, that could have been prevented by simply cooking the meat, but it would take a while, especially with how many beasts there were. Fortunately, they preferred raw meat, so no wait was needed for them. Although, they made quite a mess.

Wait, he doesn’t have a problem eating. Why was it starving when more than enough food was being delivered? His comrades took the food from him? No, unlikely, maybe the chefs underestimated how much food these things eat? Or perhaps religious motives? I heard some monks starve themselves to get to heaven, or whatever they believe in… What a foolish people.

“Excuse me.” I said as I placed the back of my palm around his collarbone and I rested my head on his torso allowing me to hear his breathing.

Compared to a human, It was quite loud, but I had nothing to compare to, so I just took mental notes. Maybe later I could do a medical exam to a more healthy individual to know what I have to look for.

Ah, but I don’t know any common…  Sighing, I rose to my feet before searching for someone that might help me. In my search outside the tent I found sister Erlineth cutting some potatoes helping some of the chefs.

She was covered in the black colors of the order and padded armor with, the only exceptions being the arms and legs that had metal armor. Her helmet was hidden under a large hood with a dark cape flowing from her back.

She also carried several crosses and a bible that hung from her waist. She had once been part of the Black Priors order, which had left the way of the Lord many years ago and she was repenting it by joining our forces.

“Sister, do you know anything in common?” I asked, getting her attention. Erlineth turned her head to me while thinking of her answer.

“Yes, although, I haven’t talked in common for a long time” Her calm manner was something very characteristic of her.

“It doesn’t really matter, will you help me?” I asked.

“Okay brother, lead the way.” She stated as she grabbed the heavy kite shield from the ground. The shield was bigger than me and was reinforced with metal in the exterior and the exposed part with a wooden interior, finally in the top center of the shield there was a large eagle head that faced forward.

To be honest, I couldn’t believe someone was capable of wielding such a tool, but hey, I’ve seen what a lawbringer carries around, so I guess the grace of the lord falls upon some, and not everyone.

Walking into the tent followed by the taller woman, the eyes of my patient fell upon her figure causing her to stiffen up.

“He was starving, but eats perfectly fine, can you ask him why?” I asked, getting a nod from Erlineth who started talking. I could see the jaw of the creature open in surprise before talking back in that same strange tone of deep growls.

“The others took it from him.” Erlineth said back in latin.

“What?!” I screamed “Are they not fed enough?” I asked, allowing time for Erlineth to translate.

“Yes.”

“Then why?” I asked, getting mad.

“Greed and strength.” She said nonchalantly. “He’s small and weak, and someone called Scooe is stronger than him. He took his rations, and some of the other hunters as well.” She continued.

“Who is Scooe?” I asked with hidden rage. If there was something I hate the most, It was those greedy or those that abused their power.

“The biggest Arxur with gray scales.”

“They are all massive and have gray scales!” I screamed annoyed.

“Why do you wanna know brother?” She asked, finally catching up to my rage.

“I’m going to beat the living shit out of him.” I quickly spoke.

“No, you will get yourself killed.” She stated as a matter of fact “What’s done is done, take care of him in the meantime.” She spoke calmly. “Need anything else brother?”

My dwindling rage that had been clouding my judgment soon started to dissipate.

“Can you ask him his age and name? If he even has one of course…” I asked before she started to translate.

“Fugoni, 14 years old.”

“He’s just fucking kid!” I stated angrily, Erlineth meanwhile kept her calm. Before I could do anything, she grabbed my shoulder to prevent me from doing so. I tried to get free, but her iron grasp prevented me from escaping.

“What’s done is done brother, now it's our job to ease his pain and make sure it won’t happen again.” Erlineth’s calm voice began to ease my anger.

“...Be damned all, fine. I will ask brother Williams for help when I finish checking him.”

“I can send him a message if you wish.” Erlineth offered.

“There is no need sister, but thank you for your time.” I thanked, to which Erlineth simply nodded before leaving the tent. “Well kiddo, let’s get you fixed…”

Pushing the loaded cart full of raw meat, I searched for the group of Arxur that, even after being released from their shackles, stuck together despite the constant fights. I was helping the chefs distribute the food for these things.

Or that was what I told them.

I wanted to know if what the kid told me was true, and if so, I would make them search for redemption.

Eventually I arrived where the Arxur were, all of them eyed me with a different type of hunger I was used to from some men, real hunger.

“*One ration per person.*” I ordered in common as I released the grasp on said cart. Many of the Arxur sprinted to the cart and true to my word grabbed one ration before eating it as quickly as they could.

Savages.

Nonetheless, my ears and eyes caught something they didn’t want to. One of the largest Arxur had taken one of the rations of another smaller Arxur.

“*One ration per Arxur.*” I stated quickly towards the beast that towered over me by a head and a half.

“*And what are you going to do, grunt*?” The Arxur rhetorically asked while the others that were on in between us stood away.

“*One, ration, per, Arxur.*” I said with authority, refusing to stand down. Said Arxur growled at me, as a response, the metallic noise of my sword being drawn was heard.

The arxur quickly finished his own rations before being left with only the stolen rations, meanwhile I approached the larger creature who stared in disbelief as the smaller creature stood his ground.

“*Return it, or you will pay consequences*” I stated as I stood face to face with it, with my shield and arming sword ready to be used. The Arxur meanwhile growled in a way that sounded like a laugh.

Suddenly the Arxur made a gesture to swallow the stolen rations, as a response, my sword slashed at the back of his hand, prompting it to drop the rations to the grassy ground. It wasn’t a deep cut, more of a warning strike.

With my arming sword I stabbed the meat rations before throwing them to their legitimate owner who stared at me in disbelief, to be more exact, everyone stared at me like that.

“*You runt*!” I heard behind, me causing me to stare back, there I found an image that for a moment surprised me. The Arxur was now lunging at me ready to tear me apart, I didn’t even have time to think as my body instinctively hid behind my heavy shield.

And a moment after that, I changed my posture even lower, allowing me to stick my shield to the underbelly of the beast before flipping it over my head.

“Ad profundis!” I screamed out of pure reflex as I flipped the Arxur, who fell hard to his back. Quickly I stood on his back before placing the edge of my shield in his nape. Usually, members of my old order sharpened the edges of our shields to make them another weapon, but I had dulled my own shield to make sure I wouldn’t be on the offensive anymore, only on the defensive, something that every knight should do.

“*Get off me runt!*” The Arxur screamed as it tried to take me off from him. Unfortunately, my armor and equipment was very heavy, and with my knee on his back meant that he wouldn’t be moving anytime soon.

“*I warned you*.” I said as I placed my arming sword under his neck, something that froze his struggles “*My master is searching for allies, not nuisances, so what are you? An ally? or a nuisance that we have to get rid of*?” I asked as I pressed my sword even tighter against his neck.

“Sister, that’s enough” A voice reached my ears in latin. Looking up I was able to see Commander Kurt with the peacekeeper Sofia at his side. From what I heard, she fought with her left hand rather than her right one, meaning that she had an advantage over almost all other fighters.

“As you wish, commander.” I said as I stood up, allowing the Arxur under me to stand up while growling.

“What were you doing? They are our allies!” Commander Kurt asked angrily.

“I was teaching a lesson. They steal the food from each other to the point that one of them almost died of starvation.” I explained.

“If that’s so, why wasn’t I warned?”

“None of them warned us about that behavior until a few hours ago, I was just testing if what we were told was true. What shall be my punishment for taking the law into my own hand?” I asked while bowing my head, then I heard a sigh, before commander Kurt responded.

“... None, for now at least. Now fuck off will ya?”

“As you wish, commander.”"
Complicated relationship with my mom and how it has affected me over the years and my current job situation.,family,17vah3i,2023-11-14 14:45:15,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/17vah3i/complicated_relationship_with_my_mom_and_how_it/,inthenameofthemoon94,,"So this is going to be a ***very long*** post. Just FYI. Thanks!  
  
I (29 F) currently live at home. I’ve been trying to find a job since January of this year. I graduated with my Business Administration-Management in Dec of 2022. Some back story first… In high school is didn’t take it seriously and I was rejected by a college that my best friend was going to. I focused and studied hard at a local college my freshman year, did excellent, and got in. I transferred and that’s where everything kind of went down hill and set the tone for the next five years. I went in for Marine Biology with a minor in Spanish. I was not doing well in just about all of my classes. I noticed though that the teachers were unnecessarily hard and acted as if this was an ivy league institution. Instead of transferring again to somewhere I know would be a better fit, I stayed. I was getting discouraged basically from the start and it diminished any focus or care to study. I would scrape by, fail exams, study hard and fail… not care and fail… somehow, I always passed. Again, just barely. The homework/papers/discussions were my saving grace. I was diagnosed with ADHD and started taking medication as well as Zoloft and then switched to Cymbalta. I was also diagnosed with general anxiety and situational depression. I had my first panic attack and continued to have them very regularly, which is why I got on the medication for depression. I was also on propranolol because the ADHD meds would sometimes either keep me very focused and calm or suddenly very active and anxious. So, the propranolol helped keep my heart rate steady. That helped my panic attacks tremendously. I kept this same pattern up until my “fifth” year of college. During that time, I also kept scraping by and having panic attacks. Again, the medication helped, but it didn’t get rid of them. I knew it went beyond just stress panic attacks, because I would get them randomly. I would be shopping with my friends and having a great time, not thinking about work or school, and then it would start. Same while I would be driving or at work. I had been in therapy since I was 19. Starting with family therapy (which I will touch on later) and then individual therapy. This was happening through me being 21/22. I decided to quit school, even though I had only a couple semesters left, and take a three-year gap. There had always been a high possibility to go back and finish. And that was what I did. However, during those three years, I began working at a vet clinic as a vet tech. It was an interesting job. I was in a very toxic environment, but like any toxic relationships, I held on because sometimes my supervisors were becoming my really good friends. I would get yelled at, lectured, and blamed unjustly. I did however have many great moments. It paid so little and between going to work, doing so much animal sitting that I was away from where I lived and my animals, and trying to save every dime to just survive, I again lost myself. I decided to leave that city, and go back home, and continue school. I started in Jan of 2020 and did my bachelors online. I admit, that my degree is basically a sham… I used the internet so much that I barely had to learn anything to pass. I got my degree, but I didn’t want to celebrate or hang it on the wall because, honestly, I didn’t really earn it. I have been trying to find jobs and there has been no success. Out of approx. 70 jobs, I have only gotten 4 interviews, probably 20 rejections, and just have been ghosted for the rest.  
  
Aside from all that, that isn’t what my biggest issue is… it’s been my mom through this process. We have always been fortunate to for how we lived. Middle class while my dad was in the air force and my mom was going to school and working as a bagger, then at a women’s health clinic, low income day care, then now working at a huge and successful library. My mom grew up in Spain during the Franco dictatorship and my grandfather was basically homeless, then fighting during the Spanish civil war, and then eventually getting married and having kids with my grandmother. He brought his brute and rough up bringing into his family. There was a lot of family abuse between my mom’s two brothers, and with her three other sisters, he and my grandmother treated them horribly. When she met my dad while he was stationed in Madrid, they married at 21 and did everything possible to leave. Despite her very toxic family, they still were very close and looked after each other. She had a much better relationship with my grandmother and siblings after they all left the house and moved on. But because of all that, my mom had a very specific attitude with us. I want to clarify that I did, for the most part, have a good childhood. All that being said, this is where all the in between started happening. My parents would fight a lot and my brother and I were annoying children. But she took that as something so negative that there was a lot of screaming and yelling and fighting. One time in 6th grade, I had a bad tantrum for me not listening to my parents. I probably did something that wasn’t nice or fought about school or something along those lines. Their solution was to film me. My mom got the idea from one of my friends’ mom’s and for her, she never acted out again. When my mom tried that on me, she had the camcorder right in my face and my dad telling me that it’ll all be over if I stop. I came across this video not too long ago while converting VHS tapes and mini DV cassettes. I completely had forgotten about it but those feelings did stick with me. Regardless of whatever I was doing, whether me being an awful preteen/teen, my mom and sometimes my dad would call me a bitch, “get the fuck over yourself”, \*in Spanish\* que te vayas a la mierda (which for us would kind of translate to go to hell), etc… Many times and I read in my old diary recently, that after those outbursts, my mom would pull me into her lap and asked if I could forgive her, and of course, I would say yes. This carried into my late teens. I will not deny that I was an easy teen. I was spoiled and could be bratty and not say the best things. Besides that, the worst I did was lie once about going to the movies and eating junk food in secret. My mom was always the kind of mom that would say “this would look better if you lost 5 pounds” or make me feel bad that I was always a little more plus size than my friends. Looking at photos from then, I was not big by any means. During her out bursts when she would get angry, she would get so enraged and blinded by her frustration with me, and chase me aggressively around the house, to the point where I needed to race to my room and lock my self in while holding the lock. Because of that, she would slam herself against the door and I would threaten to call the police. But… that was how I was treated. My brother was more mischievous and simply, not a good kid. He had issues with substance abuse and my parents didn’t treated that with the same energy as how I was treated by them. When he would be bad, my mom would grab him by his long hair, and yank as hard and throw him down. Again, she would ask for our forgiveness. This was through high school and while we were at home.  
  
Going back to my college days… they would help me financially while I was in school and working part time. Granted my mom worked extremely hard for school and working her way up to secure a good job. She sacrificed a lot of her time, energy, soul, and love to do the most for herself and for my brother and I. My dad wasn’t much of a help because he wouldn’t listen half the time and continuously not communicate well with my mom. Again, she was always angry at him. To this day, I have almost heard no good moments between them from since they got to know each other from the beginning. I was not easy at times, again I was spoiled and acted entitled even though we were very middle middle class. I never have doubted her love and support for what she has sacrificed for this family.  
  
\*I want to add that I have been in therapy since then and I have stopped going as of last year. I find myself to be in a good spot at least knowing how to handle myself. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder and take Lamictal and propranolol still. It has helped me tremendously and realized that was why depression meds did not work for me\*  
  
Going back to now… our biggest fights are of how I have been trying to search for a job and my roles in the house. I am living rent free and they take care of groceries for the house. I pay for everything else on my part (phone, car, insurance, etc., pet food/stuff, etc…) I currently also pay rent for a condo with my boyfriend that lives about 2.5 hrs away. My brother and his wife, and my bf’s family live up there. So, I really want to be there. The most my mom asks of me is to help clean the house, and I still struggle with that because of the 7 years that I was out of the house, I did everything on my own time and accord. I have been at home for three years now and I still could do way more. I fight against my mom for when it’s time to clean on the weekends and I know it is unfair and it angers her. I do the minimum and that is, I will admit, unfair because of what they do for me. I have never denied that I am spoiled and that they give so much. That doesn’t make that any better though. The biggest thing though again is the job issue. I apply a lot and I change my resume/cover letter and apply to things that I know are a little out of my league. But, every time I do whatever new thing my mom tells me try, there’s always something new to do. I must admit though, some days I don’t push myself and don’t apply, or apply to the jobs she sends me, and tell myself I’ll do it later. I have such an easy laid-back job with lots of downtime when I’m on project time or when it’s slow. I do game and read a lot. In my down time at home I’ll do that, but my mom sees that as time wasted. She believes I should be killing myself to find a job. Because I want to move out of town to be with my boyfriend I should not game, read, do anything but apply. She brings up her experience and says that because she really wanted it, she fought for it. And doing the “but that’s just me”. When she says that, and she denies the message I feel about it, it feels as if I don’t want this whole job search and moving out as bad as I say I do. One time I applied for a job and when they asked me if I was comfortable with the hours (which they didn’t post on the application) I had to ask what they were. When I told my mom, she said that when she was applying she would read their whole website and know anything because…again… she wanted it so bad. I told her that I \*literally\* took notes of everything that the organization was, but didn’t think to check their hours. They had very specific weird hours and sometimes that doesn’t translate to what your actual shift hours would be. That sparked a whole argument.  
  
With today’s huge explosive argument/discussion a lot of what I mentioned earlier, was brought up. I was told that the only way to move on with my feelings of what she’s done and how’s affected me the last almost 15 years and to stop being a victim of her actions while raising me and my brother. I don’t know if it was final, but she basically said I have until March to find a job, and if I haven’t I’m out.  
  
My biggest question or guidance is what the fuck is this whole thing. Am I wrong? Partially justified? Is she wrong? Right? Justified? Idk, I need an outside perspective. She says that my therapist tells me the wrong things, so idk why she keeps advocating to go back to therapy. She knows how sometimes I feel bitter about this and how she knows that my therapy over the years has centered around her. By the end of our outbursts I always end up questioning myself and asking if I’m actually the problem and my mom has moved on and is tiring of being a “punching bag” (which she loves to mention numerous times). She says that she has stopped feeling like a victim and is trying to make peace in her life. Things at home have shifted to not verbally/physically abusing us to just constant yelling at me or my dad.  
  
I’m probably missing certain connections for you all to get the full picture. Just ask and I’ll do my best. Thank you everybody for reading this entire essay that has come easier than my papers in school."

I'm bored as heck (type me post),MbtiTypeMe,17tcu3x,2023-11-11 23:48:51,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/17tcu3x/im_bored_as_heck_type_me_post/,biohaz_art_ous,FOR FUN," I already have a good idea of what my type is, I just wanted to see if anyone else can possibly make any assumptions. This was written a couple of months ago.  
**• How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**

I’m an 18 year old girl. I’m what someone would call an ambivert, but I really don’t like using that term as everyone technically requires social interaction and alone time. I’m more of an extrovert with huge NPC energy due to my terrible social anxiety.

I have been told that I am ambitious, well-rounded, opinionated, creative and smart, but also arrogant, argumentative, and stubborn.

I’m very quiet normally, I mind my own business. When I’m with my friends, I’m super chatty and weird.

I have been typed as an ExTx 3w2, but I’m leaning towards ExTJ because of the fact that I prioritize Te over Fi.

16p and those other tests that disguise themselves as cognitive function tests (which they are not- they prioritize letter dichotomies and then use the functions as part of the description later) have typed me as an IxTX.

**• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**

I’ve had a depressive episode during late 2020-early 2022. Because of that, I have been diagnosed with depression. As of now, however, I am doing fine.

As a kid, I’ve almost been diagnosed with ADHD because I did really badly during school. Turns out I was doing bad at school because I didn’t care at the time. I’ve also been diagnosed with generalised anxiety recently, and I suppose it makes sense, due to how fricken stressed out I am.

**• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**

My mom’s religious and it drives me nuts- not because she’s religious, but because of the stupid shit she says. She’s homophobic, racist, sexist, whatever you name it. She doesn’t like it when I eat meat on a friday, and she uses God as a threat, saying that “God is watching you” and that “God will punish you.”My dad just exists? Idk. I hang out with my cats more :)))

I don’t remember much from my childhood other than being bullied at school and being hit at home. I was a mixture of being bossy, hyperactive and arrogant as a kid, but all of that has toned down A LOT as an older teenager.

**• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**

I’m studying Biomedical Engineering. It wasn’t my first choice: my first choice was to become a doctor, but to be honest, I wasn’t too interested in becoming one.

I like my major because it combines both medicine and engineering. It is a developing field and I get to apply the stuff I learn. In the end, it’s worth it.

**• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**

I normally feel lonely, I don’t realize it until much MUCH later. I mostly focus on completing work and doing my hobbies.

**• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**

I’m more on the artsy side. I like to draw, paint, read, write fanfics, and play the piano. I do workout though, it helps me maintain myself and I temporarily feel better.

I am planning on using some of these hobbies as a side hustle- namely the art.

**• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**

I suppose I am curious? I’m not really sure.

I’m not curious for the sake of being curious, I’m curious because I think it would be useful, which is why I like STEM a lot- it’s a genuine interest of mine, and it pays out in the end. I tended to dislike subjects like history, geography and english lit because I didn’t have a use for it- I may not see the use for it, but if someone else does, that’s fine.

As for my ideas to execution ratio, I would say they are the same. I do tend to execute most of my ideas, except for the ones with bad consequences. They’re mostly conceptual? I don’t focus on the environment or helping people out for the sake of making the world a better place.

The only ideas I can think about are hobbies related, namely because I’m trying to survive in school and do my best. When it comes to my hobbies, mostly story writing, I try to make systems and write my own lore.

**• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**

I would enjoy taking on a leadership position, and as a university student who’s still trying to get out of the effects of a two and a half year pandemic, it’s a little hard, but I enjoy it. With experience, I would be good at it. I would make sure people get their stuff done on time, while being fair - I don’t wanna be the reason why people don’t wanna go to work. That has happened to me before and it sucks.

**• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**

I guess I am coordinated lol

I do play the piano, but I depend more on my memory, thus, I suck at sight-reading. As an engineering student, I’ve only worked with my hands in my Electric Circuit Analysis class, and it was my favourite class despite the math getting complicated near the end of the course.

**• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**

I am artistic. I don’t draw for the sake of expressing my emotions- I have done that once and felt really uncomfortable. 

I draw for the sake of expressing ideas- If I think something is cool, then I will draw it, which is why I draw characters from my favourite games a lot.

I’m more into sparkly, magic things IG.

When it comes to traditional artwork, I don’t like abstract art too much. I’ve seen some pieces that make no sense. I’m more into artwork that conveys meaning or fanart of my favourite characters.

**• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**

I have to admit, my childhood was shit, so I don’t really hold too much value of the past. The only value I have is from the lessons I’ve learned (eg. grades don’t indicate intelligence, being a dick isn’t cool, etc…).

The present is something I usually try to focus on? I usually plan out for the next week or whatever. I do have a 5 year plan but not all the details worked out. I’m slightly sucky at long term planning and “predicting the future”.

**• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**

I usually help them without hesitation, mostly because they ask me for help at something I’m good at. For example, during high school, I used to top my math and science classes, and people would ask me for help because of that. I don’t mind, until they take advantage of me or just leave me to get help from someone else. I don’t know why I help them, I just help them because they asked for it I guess.

The only time I don’t help people is in an area I’m unfamiliar with, in that case, I just send them away to find another person.

**• Do you need logical consistency in your life?**

Yes. If something doesn’t make sense, I won’t care about it. That is why I hate my mom’s stupid traditions and stuff.

**• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**

These things are very important- they cut back a lot of unnecessary work. Whenever there is a task, I usually look for an easier way to do it, and I end up getting more work done for the same quality.

One thing I keep in mind is to study smart, not hard.

**• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**

I don’t think I control others? At least, not that I know of.

Whenever I’m working on a group project for uni, I make sure everyone does their part- I don’t know if that is considered controlling.

Even if I were to control others, I wouldn’t micromanage them - they need to be creative to some extent but also get the work done.

The only thing I do however, is to push people to live up to their potential and offer solutions as part of their problems.

**• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**

As I said, my hobbies are more on the artsy side. I mainly use them as a destressor from my STEM heavy lifestyle, and also I think it’s good to be well-rounded and have lots of hobbies.

**• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**

Visual-kinesthetic?? Idk.

I’ve heard students learn effectively from all three learning styles, and frankly, most of my learning has been visual up to now. Auditory learning isn’t my style because all the info goes from one ear and out the other, and my memory is pretty shitty, but if I practiced it with the other two, it would be good.

The only reason why I’m majoring in biomed. engineering was because I picked up some random anatomy books as a kid, thought it was cool, and did some totally (unrelated) science experiments. School was so boring as a kid, and I didn’t do good until the 7th grade, because that’s when they started looking at my grades for high school.

**• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**

I normally strategize whenever I’m faced with a task, and I would say I’m good at it. The only time when I wing projects and improvise is when I don’t care about so much - hence my terribly written, last minute essays for english class.

**• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**

I want to be successful, and most of all, remembered.

My goals involve: getting enough credentials to put on my resume during uni and after that (masters in engineering and also one in business administration, and possibly a phd), becoming a successful engineer, and making sure all my hard work pays off.

I have a personal goal, and it is to become the best version of myself: The pandemic didn’t account for much of that, and now that I’m in uni, I’m breaking out of my shell little by little.

**• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**

I guess somebody taking advantage of me. I don’t normally emote a lot because I don’t want anyone to know how I’m feeling. But it’s kinda bad to the point I don’t realize my own feelings have been hurt when someone offends me. One thing that makes me uncomfortable is talking to people on a personal level, I guess that’s another reason why I didn’t settle on becoming a doctor- these guys talk to a lot of people and comfort them and etc…

I hate not living up to my fullest potential- which explains why I felt like shit and developed depressing feelings during the pandemic. I also hate it when others don’t live up to their potential, and I criticize them (not out loud).

**• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?**

I’m not sure what the highs in my life look like- maybe it’s when I accomplish something. I have won multiple awards for piano, academics, and other smaller things. It’s not in the form of awards, but also personal things, like artwork. I treat art like I do regular work, and after having artblock for so long, completing something is a great accomplishment.

**• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?**

The biggest low for me was the pandemic. According to my doctor, I was despondent, lazy, unmotivated, and very blue. I lost sight of my goals and ate a lot of food and felt really lonely.

I actually mistyped as an INTP because of that.

**• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**

I guess I’m a mix of being a daydreamer and being realistic. The only occurrence of me being realistic happens in my academic life - I anticipated that engineering school would be tough, and it is. I remember our class had a discussion about our first semester of uni so far, and some kids were talking about romanticizing studying and all that stuff, and I was like, how?

I daydream when I’m at home: I like to create stories and stuff. I normally spend a decent amount of time daydreaming until I realize I’m hungry or something.

**• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**

In a worst case scenario, I would have an existential crisis - I don’t like being alone with my thoughts for far too long. Otherwise, I would probably daydream. It would still be weird to not do anything.

**• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**

Not that long. When I make an important decision, it’s because I know it will benefit me in the future, otherwise I wouldn’t make the decision in the first place. I can’t think of examples of me changing my mind, but granted, my memory is shit.

**• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**

It takes me a very long time to process them. Just last month, I dropped a friend. I was very pissed off around her, and I didn’t know why. The final straw was when she was being really bossy when discussing course selection, and in the end, she told me to quit biomedical engineering in favour of software engineering because “it’s the future” (which biomed is too). That’s when I realized, wait, I thought i hated this girl cuz she’s ugly or something, but now I realize that she’s a jerk and I was pissed whenever she’d open her mouth.

**• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**

Not that I can think of. I try to keep the conversation flowing naturally regardless of any opposing opinions, it makes the conversation more organic and interesting. For example, a friend asked me if I watch the world cup, and I told her, I’m not really into that.

**• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**

I’m mostly a rule follower, unless the rules are stupid. There was a rule about not having bags in the science classroom in highschool, and I remember going on a very long rant about it. The principal (who was new) had a good reason to not bring backpacks in because of labs. However, since this was highschool, nobody really used the science classrooms for labs unless told otherwise."

I have no doubt I use the Ni-Se axis, but I see evidence for both Fi and Fe in my thoughts and behavior. Looking at inferior also doesn't help because I think both my Se and Te are quite poor.

How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

23yo male, skinny and of average height, little muscle tone and a damaged leg. I’m usually quiet and keep to myself, not really sure how others perceive me but I’ve been told that I’m charming when I want to be. I worry often about how others see me, but I’m not too concerned with physical matters like when I last drank water or ate, or matters of work unless a deadline is rapidly approaching. 

• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

Not that I know of, but I have attempted suicide before, so depression isn’t out of the question. 

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

As a child my main caretaker was my grandmother, who took care of my meals and spent more time with me at home. My parents spent most of the week working and only interacted with me at night or during the weekends. My grandmother expresses care in the form of actions, is very cruel with her words and also emotionally turbulent. She often forbade me from playing with other children for too long. My parents were less strict, and spoiled me with toys and food as I wished. They weren’t too concerned with my grades at school, as long as I did not fail. Overall, I think I had a happy enough childhood, especially compared to my peers. My mother takes a more active role in parenting compared to my father, and she is the one I confide in the most. Religious influence did not factor much in my childhood beyond being made to attend church on Sundays, something which has continued into my adult life. 

• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I am currently still studying in university, but my aim for a career is to be a clinical psychologist. I enjoy helping people and listening to their worries, and I heavily dislike rote and detail-focused work. I’m someone who needs a purpose to really be motivated in my actions, and helping to improve the lives of others seems like quite a worthy purpose. For this reasons, I think I would enjoy this career. 

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

Although I believe that I am an introvert, I think that in such a situation I would feel quite lonely. I enjoy interacting with others in moderate amounts, and I sometimes feel a bit lost when I have no one to talk to about what I think or do. 

• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

I prefer sedentary activities, like video games or reading books. I’ve always hated sports since I was a child, mainly for fear of embarrassment at being unskilled and losing. My hand-eye coordination in that regard is fairly poor, and I feel it is something I will have to train if I am to take up a sport. The physical activity I enjoyed the most was running, since it did not involve skill or coordination yet could still be competitive. Now that my leg is busted, I only like taking slow walks around the city area. 

• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I was a very curious child, enjoying reading about science from encyclopedias and such. I’ve since lost that curiosity for how the world works, but I’m still interested in learning about humans and how they relate to each other, and even how minds work. Usually when other people tell me about something I’ve not heard before, I bring my phone out to Google it. The thing is, I’m not entirely sure whether this is for the sake of creating more opportunities for conversation or to sate my own curiosity. My ideation usually involves fantasy, be it about imaginary scenarios in real life or of stories far removed from reality. Such ideas aren’t really executable. 

• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I hate leadership, and I’m not good at it. My presence is quite weak, and I have neither the ability nor will to make others listen to me when they don’t want to. If I were to be forced into leadership, my style would be more of listening to my subordinates and having them voice their concerns or ideas as they appear. “What do you guys think?” is what I mean. 

• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

No, I am not. I’m quite awkward with my physical movements, especially since my leg is shot. I’ve never felt comfortable physically. I do enjoy working with my hands though. Recently, I’ve taken an interest in assembling keyboards, and I enjoy typing. When I am bored outside, I usually fidget with an item in my hands quite noticeably. 

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I’ve never had good hands for art, so I don’t think so. My favorite art form is writing/music, if that counts. I can see why others might enjoy art, and I can be impressed by paintings/digital art that touches my sensibility/relates to emotions I might have, but it isn’t something I seek out daily. 

• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

The past is to learn from, the present is what I’m most aware of and the future is my main reason to live and what I look forward to. I shy away from many things because of my past. I can be quite detached from the present occasionally and yet too attached in situations where I would be better off detached (say, in a physical environment where I feel uncomfortable yet am unable to leave.) The distant future is not something I think about often, but I am pursuing a certain scenery and I always worry about immediate outcomes in almost every action I take. 

• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

If it is within my reach, I have trouble saying no to people I care about. Usually my reason to help is that it would dispose them positively toward me, or conversely that if I were to refuse, they would think poorly of me. If it is something out of my capabilities or really too troublesome I try to suggest alternatives. 

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

I don’t really get what that means. Usually my actions are quite logical, or so I like to think so.

• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

I recognise why being productive is important, but can’t really bring myself to be so if I can't see how it directly contributes to my goals. Efficiency is quite important to me in terms of minimizing time spent on work. 

• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

I don’t think I am good at it, but usually my attempts to control others involve subtle influence and wording to get them to do what I want them to do without explicitly stating it. I do it because I am afraid to state directly what I want sometimes. 

• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

I enjoy competitive video games like team shooters for the feeling of winning and being competent as well as the ability to interact with friends while playing them. I like reading character-based stories to examine why they take the actions that they do, and the themes involved. I have a poor habit of purchasing beautiful things for the sake of owning and admiring them. 

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

I struggle with self-driven learning, and work best with a teacher that explains concepts with examples of how they work. This is because I lack motivation to understand things if there isn’t a purpose behind it, but usually I don’t struggle with memory or logic. I would say my physical senses are my weakest point in learning, followed by creativity. 

• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I don’t think I’m very good. For projects I don’t care about, I usually wing it and finish it within the day if I am able. For things that truly matter, I’ve found that breaking them into set goals works best for me. 

• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

I want to live a meaningful and comfortable life. I want to meet the one who loves me and who I love. I want to do something that contributes to society in a humanitarian manner for my job, and I want to enjoy what life has to offer me. 

• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

I fear that people think poorly of me, be it that I am weak, socially inept or an asshole. It makes me uncomfortable to be in loud and populated places for too long, especially if populated by people who know me. It’s also uncomfortable to be around people who you know that are arguing, or otherwise unhappy with each other. In such cases I try my best to remedy the situation or, failing that, retreat to elsewhere. I hate people who are too extreme and fail to see the obvious as a result. People who cannot tell when they are being insensitive, and people who fail to see that they are acting irrationally are both irritating to me. People who are too obnoxious and obstinate in their viewpoint and those who cannot tell how off-putting they are externally also frustrate me. Finally, people who insist that they know what the best method is for me, especially over trivial things. “It doesn’t matter, so why do you care so much?” is what I mean. 

• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

To be honest, I don’t really know. I was happiest when caught up with my crush and socializing well with others around me, I think. 

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

A lot of obsessing, overthinking, indulging my whims and pleasures, rash decisions made. 

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I daydream very often, but usually those daydreams are grounded in reality, just unlikely to actually happen. Usually I’m quite aware of my surroundings, almost too much so, and it's quite easy to snap me out of daydreaming. 

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

Imagining how I got into such a situation, bemoaning how lonely and bored I will be, wishing for some outer power to take me away from the situation, through death or otherwise. 

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

It usually takes very long. I usually consult any close person that is easily accessible and ask them for their thoughts and opinions, ruminate over what could go wrong with each decision path and whether there is something I’m missing. Although it takes long, once I’ve made my decision I think it would unfortunately be quite easy to sway me, although I can’t think of any concrete examples. This is just how I think it would go. 

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

I usually deny them if they are negative emotions that I feel guilty for feeling/think I should not be feeling. Feeling happy and fulfilled is very important to me. Emotions control me quite strongly, and my mood determines how productive I am on that particular day. I think emotions are important and all have a function, but I am working on becoming more emotionally intelligent and capable of self-soothing without resorting to destructive/escapist behaviors. 

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

All the time. I have my own thoughts, but I find it too much trouble and maybe a bit scary to debate them with other people, because I am not often able to convey my meaning in a persuasive manner and they might refute my argument in a manner that leaves me tongue-tied. It’s easier in my opinion to just agree with them and hear more about their viewpoint than to challenge them in any strong manner. This habit makes conversations with certain people quite tiresome, but it also makes others positively disposed towards me, so I’m not inclined to change it any time soon. 

• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

No. I think authority should be questioned often, to keep it accountable, but usually authority is where it is for a good reason. If I break rules, it’s usually because I don’t think those rules matter that much in terms of facilitating a morally good environment, or because other people are breaking them too.

The Truly Strong,HFY,178o8ch,2023-10-15 16:28:24,855,1.0,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/178o8ch/the_truly_strong/,Rebelhero,OC,"We had never been to war with the Humans before. We had heard the stories from the other races who had faced them in combat. They had remarked upon their outlandish strategies, and the fierce resistance. Every race that fought the Humans, win or lose, considered them a more-than-worthy opponent. Every race that fought the Humans, came away respecting them. When the time came for us that war was to be declared on the Humans, what took us by surprise the most was how hard they tried to avoid going to war with us. We knew they were not afraid of us. Their avoidance of a fight seemed to come from a position of strength, not cowardice. Perhaps, we thought, they had been weakened by another recent conflict?   
  
We should have heeded our own ancient proverbs.   
  
“The truly strong do not seek to prove their strength, only to share it.” As our saying goes.  
  
But the Humans committed an error that demanded war. No matter how much they tried to talk us out of it, no matter what bargains they brought, they landed vehicles of war on one of our planets. This constituted an invasion by our laws, and their repeated refusal to answer our call to war insulted our honor. The laws and demands of honor were clear.   
  
When it became clear to the Humans that we would not back down, their tones changed. Instead of trying to weasel out of their insult upon our honor, they requested a War Council. They requested the presence of political leaders and military leaders alike on neutral territory. Our advising species, allies and trading partners, all strongly recommended we accept and attend. They warned us to take it seriously.  
  
At the War Council, the Humans outlined the conditions for waging war upon them. In the age of planet cracking missiles, life destroying bioweapons, and star collapsing bombs… rules of war seemed outrageous. All of these superweapons were prohibited from use in a war with the Humans. We thought they were joking, that they lured us here to waste our time, and prepare their invasion. We soon found they were not, as they layered more and more rules upon us. We would have been outraged if we had not been so stunned.   
  
Restrictions on weapons, ship class, what can and can not be targeted, the establishment of no conflict lanes for civilians to flee from combat, the treatment of enemy combatants and prisoners of war, ceasefire periods to collect the wounded and dead from the battlefield. With so many rules it appeared to us like the Humans treated war like it was a sporting event, instead of battle! Our representatives were not pleased.  
  
“You treat this as if it is a game! Where is your honor? Where is your desire for battle, for victory?” They had demanded, throwing the hefty stack of papers across the room in a fit of anger. The Human representatives simply looked tired, at the time, we had mistaken it for boredom which further enraged us.  
  
“It is a game. A game played by honorless children. There is no honor in war. War itself is a lack of honor. Honor is everything that proceeds a war, and everything that follows it. There is only **one** honorable way to wage a war, and that is to never wage it at all.” The Human military representative spat back at us. There was a fire in his features. We were too insulted to notice it then, but that fire was hatred. The Humans hated us, for forcing them to war.  
  
“These rules are our attempt to bring a *scrap* of honor to war. To lessen the burden of those who would suffer. Those who never had a choice, never had a say in whether or not war was waged. So, do the *honorable* thing and sign the agreement. Or prepare for total war.” Those last words were a whisper. A quiet threat, that had every other species in the room suddenly on edge. Thank The Supreme God that we noticed it. Our representatives were quiet for a long moment. Our War-leader spoke up first, slowly and quietly.  
  
“What happens if this total war is what we wish? What happens when it is our desire to fight a worthy opponent at full strength? To clash on the battlefield with nothing held back?”   
  
The human sighed and rubbed his face, as if he was a tired father trying to explain a simple fact to a young child.  
  
“Then we all lose. Hundreds of Billions will die, and for ***what?*** Pride? Honor? Land? Any number of things that could be sorted out at a meeting, or over a beer and a fist fight? Crippled economies, entire planets lost, food, energy, resources; all scarce. Who picks up the pieces after that? A war like that doesn’t end with a cease fire. The battle continues on every street, in every home of all the survivors. The war ends, but the suffering continues for years, decades. Please. Just sign the agreement and let’s leave the fighting to the soldiers who signed up for it. Let’s leave the citizenry out of it. If we must fight, let us fight and be done with it.”  
  
The room buzzed with nervous energy. We were no strangers to war. We had battled our way to the Empire we held. But the Human’s plea forced us to remember the aspect of war we all wished to ignore. The aftermath. The drop after the high of battle fades. We didn’t know why the humans cared so much for the lives of the people so much though. Did the citizens not live to serve their empire? At the demands of our allies though, many of which threatened to withdraw support if we refused to sign, we signed the agreement and war was officially declared.  
  
…  
  
Two years. We were utterly defeated in two years.  
  
In the opening days of the war we hit the humans hard. We overran their defenses with sheer might. We threw them from our space and pushed them back to their borders. We kept the momentum, slamming against their lines and chasing close behind as they fled. Even with all of their annoying restrictions we outmatched them easily. Through system after system we chased them as they fled, stopping only in vain attempts to slow our advance.  
  
Then, at one system, they dug in and our advance abruptly halted. It was like crashing into a cliffside in a wooden boat. We rose to the challenge though. We were proud warriors, we relished the challenge. We hammered them endlessly, we knew how to prepare for a siege. We were ready. Supplies, ammo, reserves, we brought it all with us.  
  
But the Humans did not give an inch. For a whole year they held us at the border. Then, reports from home began to flood in, several months out of date. While we were engaging the humans here at their border, they had sent other fleets out behind us. They had destroyed many of our shipyards and factories, our farm worlds were blockaded and financial centers were bombed. The first thing they had attacked though, was our communications network. We had chased them right into a trap. They used our desire to humiliate them for questioning our honor against us. Our defense fleets were putting up a good fight, but anywhere they set up to defend, the humans just attacked another target at the other end of our Empire. With our communications crippled, we had no idea when and where they would show up.  
  
Sneaky, Cowardly tactics, we had thought at the time. The Humans continued to disappoint us. We were told that they were among the best fighters in the galaxy. Adept and efficient in warfare. An invaluable ally and a troublesome foe. We had misunderstood what they meant. Humans weren’t efficient in fighting a war, they were efficient at *ending* a war.  
  
A few months after the initial reports of the Humans attacking across our Empire, away from the front lines, we received reports of our worlds falling into open rebellion. There hadn’t been an open rebellion in our empire in centuries. There were always dissidents, but actually full open rebellion? Those were the reports that finally made us realize how unprepared we were for Human warfare.  
  
At that time, we had only seen war as a series of battles and supply lines. Fight enemy, conquer battlefield, capture or destroy the objective, then move on. That was all we had needed to consider, as up until that point we had fought wars in a linear fashion. An Empire as large as ours had a military just as large. We had the money and resources to field hundreds of millions of fighting troops, with acceptable weapons and armor and ships.   
  
The Humans took all our military doctrine and threw it back in our face. They cared nothing for honor and glory in combat like every other civilized race. Their tactics were base and cowardly… but effective. Very effective. We didn’t adapt in time. We couldn’t adapt in time.  
  
Thus, with our worlds falling to rebellion, our economy crippled, our supplies cut off… we were forced into our only unconditional surrender in the history of our Empire. Humanity had made it clear that nothing else would suffice.   
  
When we entered the hall to sign our surrender, and accept the human’s terms, we hung our heads. Unable to meet the piercing stares of the humans. We had expected smugness on their features, we expected them to gloat and belittle us. As usual, we were wrong. Their faces were a mix of fury and pity. When we signed the documents, we didn’t even bother to read the conditions. We had simply assumed it was the end of our Empire. The end of our freedom.   
  
And, as usual, We were so very wrong.  
  
“Are you happy now?” The Human military leader stood as the convention came to an end. “Tens of thousands of lives lost. Trillions in damages. Half a dozen of your worlds are in open rebellion, increasing the casualty numbers every day. All because you couldn’t accept an apology!”  
  
The other humans in the area tried to move him away, hold him back. But he threw them off. “I’m sick of having to go to war with one backwards ass species after another in order to show you there is so much more to the universe than conquest!”  
  
Many of the attending species lowered their heads while the human raged. I realized that those were the species that the humans had bested previously. They were the ones that begged us to accept the terms of human warfare. It was then, for me, that the pieces fell into place. Nearly all of the attending species were major economic trading partners with the humans. Each of them had large, militaristic empires in the past. Just like ours. Unlike us however, their history prominently featured some kind of disaster which fractured their empire and nearly resulted in their extinction. Were the humans responsible? Was that why they were so adamant on us signing the agreements?  
  
I’m not sure any if the others had the revelation that I had as we left the convention in shame. We returned to our Empire in shambles. Our forces tried to hold together what we could, and we all but abandoned the worlds that rebelled. To say that this defeat was crushing would have been an understatement. We had based our entire culture on pride and honor. On our aggressive expansion and military might. In just two short years, one single short war, and it all came crashing down on us.  
  
This demoralizing defeat crippled our leadership, as the strong of our society blamed them for our losses and the weak banded together and attempted to overthrow us. It fell to those of us who kept our heads to try and run the empire. A nearly impossible task, given that the knowledge of how to run an empire sat firmly in the hands of the powerful old blood clans. Who, I must reiterate, were so demoralized by this loss they became useless lumps.  
  
When the Human warp signatures appeared over our home planet, we believed it to be the end. Tens of thousands of ships, most of them larger than anything we have ever seen before, hovering in orbit. Thousands more spilling out of the larger vessels.  
  
“This is Fleet Admiral Kain, of the Allied Systems Restoration Fleet. I hope we aren’t too late. Reports from your system are… grim to say the least.” This was the hail we received. No threats, no gloating… just a man, with concern in his voice. I was the one managing system communications that day. My response was a dumbfounded one.  
  
“You…. you aren’t here to destroy us… enslave us?” Through that hail I heard a brief sound of someone cheering, followed by a harsh admonishment.  
  
“They never read the terms…” Kain had chuckled under his breath, though loud enough for me to hear. “No, we come bearing aid. Food, Doctors, crisis management teams, peacekeepers, construction equipment and material. We even managed to snag a few asteroids full of raw materials and precious metals from neutral space. Though uh… mostly because I bet the engineering team they couldn’t grab one as we passed it on sub-light engines.”  
  
None of us could believe what we heard. Though none of us should have been surprised at this point. Everything we assumed about humans was consistently wrong.   
  
“A defeated empire is dangerous if left unattended. We learned that lesson back on Earth almost a thousand years ago. So, in the interest of furthering peace, we shall turn a defeated enemy into an ally. We will help jumpstart your economy, repair your worlds and bring peaceful ends to the rebellions. We will also work on reestablishing your government. Though, this time under our guidance.”  
  
“You would help us? After defeating us in war?”  
  
“It isn’t just us. Our crews are made up of a few dozen allied species, though the ships are of human make and design. We may have built this fleet but we couldn’t crew it alone. And after this is all done, some of your race will probably join us in rebuilding the next hapless empire to get wrecked. Besides, the conflict is over. You aren't enemies anymore.”  
  
Their ships were hundreds of times larger than our largest. If they could spare these resources to both build ships this large and aid former enemies at the same time… what do their vessels of war, the ones they held back, look like? It was a chilling thought. With all our belief in our superior might, with everything we built and achieved… they could have swept it all away with the press of a button. We were nothing to them. Insects biting at the heels of giants.  
  
“Oh come on! Even if that was true, which it isn’t by the way. You’re people, just like everyone else! Even if it were true, and you were insects to us. Insects still have their place in the ecosystem. Their presence is required for the health of the entire system! It’s all just a matter of perspective. Just because someone is smaller or weaker doesn’t mean they deserve to be annihilated.” Kain laughed over the hail.  
  
Apparently I voiced my thoughts out loud. Opps.   
  
“And… And what is this “help” going to cost us?” I attempted to recover myself.  
  
“Cost you? You’ve already paid the price. A crippled military, economy, and government. Not to mention the cost of lives. No. No, the price has already been paid.” Kain responded, but my mind still reeled. None of this made sense. Obviously, every species out there has a different philosophy, different ways of living. This though… this is too far out there.  
  
“Why?” I asked quietly. I heard Kain groan and take a deep breath.  
  
“What do you want me to say, huh?” His tone then took on a mocking flair. “BeCaUsE iT’s ThE jOb Of ThE sTrOnG tO pRoTeCt ThE wEaK. Is that what you wanted to hear? No… man…” His professionalism crumbled under the weight of his exasperation. I could hear him take a few breaths to regain his composure before continuing.  
  
“We do this because it’s the right thing to do. Your people are suffering, we have the means to aid you. So, we are going to aid you. It would be cruel not to. It doesn’t matter that we are former enemies. We weren’t enemies before the war, and now we aren’t again. We are helping you because we can, because it’s right. Now, will you accept our aid, or will you turn us away?”  
  
It was here that something tickled in the back of my mind. A saying from ancient days, always taken out of context without the full sentence.  
  
The truly strong do not seek to prove their strength. That was the saying we repeated to youngsters as a platitude. A warning about pride. An admonishment to prevent them from making fools of themselves and starting needless fights. But somewhere, tucked away in the back of my mind was the rest of the saying, that we as a people had forgotten. Or perhaps ignored.  
  
The truly strong do not seek to prove their strength, only to share it.  
  
Our reliance on systems of pride and honor led us to this point. Our narrow view of strength has led us to be humbled in the most devastating way possible. By our customs, to accept this help would make us weak, undeserving of life. I looked around at the people in the room with me. Most of them were barely hanging on. Despair had taken so many, and was threatening to spread to the rest of us. No one else had a clear enough head to make this decision.  
  
“Help us. Please.” I asked quietly. Ashamed.  
  
“We would be happy to.” Was the response.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Johan, human technician**

**Date [Standard Human Reckoning]: 2136-12-08**

The krakotl turned their back on me, their blue feathers glistening in the corridor light. The sight propelled my mind back to the invasion, back to lying on the observation room floor with Vani. Our eyes were glued to the transparent ceiling, where above us a nightmarish tableau unfolded in low orbit, swirling dogfights, bursts of plasma, and streaks of falling debris. The comforting chants of Gojid emanated from the camp speakers and offered solace, but they couldn't dispel the undercurrent of fear that one of those bombs could plummet down on us.

It took the krakotl a moment to become aware of the rush of venlils toward Vani and me.

""Johan,"" a voice tried to penetrate my distracted consciousness, but my mind was embroiled in too much turmoil to respond.

Finally, the krakotl noticed the influx of venlils and turned to locate the source of the commotion. Our eyes locked, and my fingers clenched, nails digging into my palm. A rush of memories overwhelmed me. I thought of Jakarta, of the footage showing the moment a bomb detonated over National Monument Park, turning matter into energy. The aftermath left us a smoldering crater, wiping out centuries of culture and history in an instant. Though I escaped the immediate horror, the sheer scope of the destruction had once left me sobbing in an airship.

""Johan?"" The voice, now laced with deeper concern, tugged at my attention again, I recognized it as Kaisal.

I must have recoiled or snarled, for the krakotl's eyes widened in shock before they retreated into one of the rooms lining the hall.

""Johan, are you all right? You're showing your teeth, and not in a good way,"" said Kaisal, his snout breaking into my field of vision and pulling me back to the present. I glanced around to see venlils of various fur tones and sizes encircling us. Everyone's ears are drooping except Vani's.

""Ah, yes, sorry,"" I said, shaking my head as if to dislodge the disturbing images. ""I had some thoughts.""

""You saw Nurlel, didn't you?"" Kaisal asked, his eyes narrowing.

""Is that the krakotl's name?""

Kaisal's ears twitched in a way that signaled affirmation.

""Yes, I...,"" I exhaled a resigned sigh. ""I didn't expect to see a krakotl here.""

""Like many krakotls on Venlil Prime, she ended up here because of political reasons,"" Kaisal explained. ""She opposes the invasion. But she's just a citizen, and not of the krakotl alliance even.""

At some logical level, I understood. After all no krakotl would grace Humanity's Friend if they harbored even the slightest ill will towards humans. But that understanding didn't make me feel any more comfortable with her presence.

""I understand,"" I conceded, lifting my hand in a conciliatory gesture. ""It's just that—never mind. I should apologize for glaring at her.""

""We can ask her if she’d like that,"" Kaisal suggested.

Throughout our chat, I noticed the expressiveness of Kaisal's body language, his ears, his tail, and his overall movements. It looked far more expressive than what I'd observed in Vani. As if in conversation with Kaisa, other venlils around move in harmony with him.  I thought of their physical expressiveness as simple emotional cues. I see now that their body language can act as a sophisticated non-verbal communication.

""Hold on a second,"" I broke in. ""You're not leaving Ramatu to manage the booth by herself again, are you?""

""No, another venlil has taken my place at the booth,"" Kaisal assured me. ""Besides, Ramatu insisted that I was the best choice to show you around.""

As I collected myself, I took in the hall I stood in. It extended deep into the building, ending with a couple of large doors at the far end, just like the one I came in from. Smaller doors lined both sides of the hall at regular intervals along. I presume that each leads to different classrooms or meeting spaces. I also noticed that the architectural style didn't quite fit the venlil design language I had grown familiar with. Its sharp angles and rigid lines diverged from the rounded edges I'd come to associate with them.

""Did humans contribute to the construction here?"" I asked.

""Indeed,"" Kaisal confirmed. ""When I pitched the concept to UNOFA. They found the concept compelling enough to aid in the construction of this space."" 

Just then, a venlil poked their head out from the door where Nurlel escaped too. ""Nurlel agreed to speak with you,"" they announced.

I walked toward the door from which the venlil had emerged. The rest of the group trailed a respectful distance behind. I thought of a flock of sheep and tried to wipe it from my mind. I shouldn't compare them to animals.

The bilingual sign next to the door read ""Cooking Class"" in both English and Ventongue. Peering inside, I saw Nurlel. Her vibrant plumage stood out against the sterile, organized cooking stations. She stood in the middle of the room, as if unsure where she belonged.

""Uh… hi,"" I began.

""Hello,"" she replied, extending her wings in a way that revealed three hooked claws at each tip. Her people looked like an amalgamation of a turkey and a deinonychus.

""I apologize for my earlier reaction,"" I said in an attempt to ease the tension.

She gestured across her feathered body with her wing. ""And I apologize for… the invasion, I suppose?""

I shook my head. ""No, I can't hold you responsible for the actions of your government on...uh...Shintal"" I hesitated, grappling for the name of her homeworld.

""Nishtal,"" she supplied.

""Right, Nishtal,"" I nodded. ""You're a citizen of Venlil Prime now, aren't you?""

She extended her wings in a motion I interpreted as a shrug. ""Yes, I've secured permanent residence for a few years now, and recently, I became a citizen.""

""So you haven't set your foot back on Nishtal since you left?"" I asked.

Her eyes took on a wistful cast as she looked away. ""I would like to, but I don't have a home to return to anymore.""

""What do you mean, 'no home left'?"" Someone who stood beside me asked. I looked to my right and found Janji. I realized that the other venlils had filled the room.

""You didn't know?"" Nurlel questioned, tilting her head.

""Until several paws ago, I had spent my time on an arxur farm,"" he explained.

""Oh..."" Nurlel's gaze shifted between me and Vi as if seeking some form of clarification. 

""What happened to Nishtal?"" Janji pressed.

""Human authorities directed arxurs toward Nishtal,"" she responded.

Janji's eyes narrowed, looking between me and Vi. ""You sent arxurs to destroy her world?""

Nurlel interjected, ""To clarify, humans didn't order the arxurs to invade. They informed the predators that with the krakotl fleet engaged elsewhere, Nishtal had nothing to protect it.""

""Does the intention even matter?"" Janji's voice trembled. ""Arxurs tore my life apart. How can you sound so nonchalant about it? They slaughtered your people!""

Nurlel's looked between me and Vi again. ""Human authorities did alert the invasion force, giving them time to return and fend off the arxurs.""

Janji persisted, ""But you mentioned your homeworld lies in ruins now. What happened?""

Before anyone could answer I stepped in. ""Their invasion force chose not to return. They let their own world fall.""

I remember the time when Dunyab, the gojid girl, sent a heartfelt message to the invaders and they replied with a callous message.

A heavy silence descended upon the room, and after a while, Vi broke the stillness. ""Desperation can push us into actions that we won't do under normal circumstances.""

Janji let out a disdainful scoff. ""How convenient of you to use desperation to justify acts of horrors.""

Nurlel spoke, ""Desperation serves as a far more palatable motive than sheer hatred. We wanted to do to Earth what the arxurs did to Nishtal. Despite warnings about the arxurs coming to our planet, the extermination fleet didn't pull back from their quest to annihilate Earth. What does that say about us krakotls?""

Janji's eyes scanned the room, examining the various venlils who had absorbed the conversation. ""So, no one here takes issue with this?"" He said, perhaps trying to find support.

""And you don't take issue with humans being threatened with extinction?"" Kaisal spoke up. ""Before the invasion, they begged in a Federation summit for the galactic community to give them a chance. By the stars and the voids between, they were willing to die for us! One of them died for me!""

""We... had a summit?"" Janji's disdain had gone away and the venlil now sounded unsure.

Another venlil answered, ""Yeah, we did. The kolshian tried to kill diplomats that tried to extend a paw of friendship toward the humans.""

Kaisal pressed on, ""So? What do you want humans to do?"" The pitch of his voice rose, which signed agitation in venlil. ""Lay down and let the extermination fleet wipe them out?""

Janji paused, at a loss for words. ""I... don't know.""

Kaisal's expression changed. Even without a deep understanding of venlil body language, I could feel rage emanating from him. ""They negotiated for your release, you ingrate!"" he spat.

""Enough!"" Vi intervened. ""Look... for most of you the arxurs might be some abstract horror. But Janji lived it every day until his release."" She turned her attention to Janji, who looked smaller. ""Would you like some time alone?""

""Y...yeah."" Janji hesitated. ""I… I need time to process this.""He took a few steps backward, and the venlils in the room stepped aside, granting him an exit from the cooking class. Vi paused for a moment before following him.

Vani turned to me. ""Should I go after them?""

""Maybe you should?"" I replied, unsure. ""Janji might find another venlil's presence comforting.""

""I'll watch over them as well."" Vani's mother declared. The two venlil then exited the class too, going after Janji.

As the atmosphere lightened, Nurlel seemed contemplative. ""Maybe I shouldn't have brought up Nishtal.""

""He would've learned about it sooner or later,"" I assured her. ""And Nurlel, I'm sorry for what happened to your homeworld. I wish... this doesn't have to happen.""

Nurlel just nodded in response.

Kaisal's demeanor seemed to soften as another venlil rubbed his back and whispered something soothing in his ear. ""I apologize for getting heated,"" he said. ""Now Vani has to console him, and I can't show him around.""

""Well… Vani can have his own session,"" I suggested. ""For now, how about you show me and Vichak around?""

With that, Kaisal led us through the facility. After leaving the cooking class, we entered a language classroom. ""Language learning seems to be more of a human pursuit. Most of us only learn other languages if we want to make a career in interstellar diplomacy.""

""I've been picking up Swahili,"" he continued. ""It was Moïse's native language.""

""Have you tried learning English?"" I asked.

He laughed. ""I've tried, but English writing just doesn't make sense to me.""

""Ep esha ifit charu te-jengel u-venlil"" I retorted, grinning.

""Okay, fair point, but venscript at least has reg- wait."" he turned back at me. ""say that again""

Repeating the phrase, I explained, ""Even venlil script has its challenges.""

Kaisal's ears perked up in astonishment. ""Wow, that wasn't translated! You've picked up Venspeak!""

""I mean, it's not that rare, right?"" I shrugged.

Kaisal's tail swayed with amusement. ""Well, a lot of humans have learned our language, but they live in our homeworld. I never expected someone from Earth to pick it up.""

""Well... considering Johan and Vani-"" Vichak paused for several beats. ""-spend time together all the time. I can see how he ended up learning our language.""

During the tour, I noticed that a variety of shawls and vests adorned the venlils in the HF. Kaisal led us toward the source, a sewing class.

""At first we tried human-style clothing,"" Kaisal explained, ""but the fabric rubbed our furs in the wrong way, so we adapted.""

Through the door of the classroom, I spotted a human working on a venlil mannequin telling them about the basics of creating patterns from a scanner. The garment they crafted looked like a sleeveless jacket, designed to work with the venlil's fur thickness.

""On Earth, you've industrialized clothing production, haven't you?"" Kaisal asked.

""True,"" I replied, tugging at my vest. ""A machine-made this. But I think bespoke clothing suits your people well, for accessories.""

""I love having more pockets, myself."" chimed in a venlil who wore an apron much like Vani's.

Our next destination was less academic, a mixed-species gaming room. Here I saw venlils and humans playing all sorts of games, from tabletops to VR simulations. Adjacent to the room they also have a nursery where young venlils and human kids play under adult supervision.

By the end of the tour, I found myself carrying a hefty bag full of snacks as a farewell gift.

Standing at the threshold of the Humanity's Friends facility, Vichak pondered aloud, ""I wonder if you have plans to expand this initiative to other cities.""

Kaisal's eyes brightened. ""Perhaps your city can have this sort of facility too? Where do you live anyway.""

""Just one Beltline stop away from the capital, in Kleran,"" Vichak answered.

""What a coincidence! Incidentally, we are indeed considering expanding to Kleran. Maybe you could assist us?"" Kaisal proposed.

""Perhaps."" Vichak allowed. ""I do have a few human kids in my school who would benefit from this kind of facility.""

""Isn't that Janji over there?"" Kaisal squinted, focusing on a figure sitting on a bench.

Following his left eye line of sight, I saw Janji sitting between Vani and Pintal, all of them enjoying a potong ice cream sandwich. Vi stood beside them, munching on a similar ice block enveloped in a slice of bread. I glanced at the booth that Kaisal and Ramatu used to staff and noticed it had a new vendor.

As we approached, the ground beneath my feet gave away with each step. I found myself contemplating what it'd feel like to walk barefoot on this planet. Perhaps this explains why venlils don't wear shoes.

""Hey, Johan! How did the tour go?"" Vi greeted us.

""Very enlightening,"" I said, glancing at the venlils. Janji had finished his ice cream.

""Those are coconut milk ice cream, aren't they?"" 

""Yes, the vendor said they're from your country,"" Vichak said. ""We tried something similar in Nusantara Capital. There, they add a sprinkling of fluffy bread rather than wrapping the ice block in it."" She took another bite. ""I love your fluffy bread.""

""Hey... Janji."" Kaisal said. ""I'm sorry for calling you Ingrate. I... couldn't imagine how harrowing your experience must be.""

Janji finished the last morsel of his treat, before speaking.

""I owe everyone an apology too, especially humans..""

""For what?"" I queried.

His eyes averted. ""I made an unfair judgment when Vi mentioned how people sometimes do terrible things to survive. It didn't occur to me that I had been in the exact same boat. You don't spend years in an arxur farm without making doing something heinous.""

""You didn't have much of a choice."" I offered.

""I could've ended it all back at the farm,"" Janji retorted. ""But I chose to live. What does that make me?""

""A survivor,"" Vani cut in. ""We all have the drive to survive.""

""Shall we call it a day?"" Vi steered the conversation elsewhere. ""We can head back and unwind before the last meal. Johan, have you sorted out your lodging?""

""I found a spot at a human refugee complex,"" I said. ""I checked its availability on our way from the restaurant to the HF Center. They had open rooms. How about you all?""

""We'll have Vani join us at our hotel,"" Pintal demanded.

Before I could voice any reservations, Vichak added, ""Yes! It's been too long since we've had a meal together as a family. It would be nice.""

I hesitated, Then it struck me, if Vani stayed with me, how would that look to Janji, who still had no clue about Vani and me? Realizing the potential awkwardness of the situation, I acquiesced. ""That sounds like a wonderful idea.""

""I'll be at the human refugee complex as well,"" Janji disclosed. ""I can't stay in the rescue apartments any longer.""

That remark implied a lot of history that I don't think I wanted to probe. Besides, the moment didn't seem right for deeper questions. 

""By the way...can I interest you two, Vani and Pintal in a tour of the HF facility?"" Kaisal said.

""Sure... that would be nice!"" Pintal agreed.

We bid a brief farewell to Vani and his family and set off with Vi. During the drive, I caught glimpses of Janji in the rearview mirror and he looked as tense as ever. I opted to focus on my pad, reading about the refugee complex. The complex consisted of several blocks of mid-rise apartments. Each block itself had a collection of individual buildings. Each one of the blocks had an open garden community space.

Upon arrival, I saw that the ground floor opened to the outside world, housing laundromats, convenience stores, and even cafes. When the car drove in front of the lobby, my glasses informed me they had detected Earth-based protocols and deactivated the gateway device.

""Here we are,"" Vi announced.

As soon as I stepped on the hard terran-style ground, my glasses painted a floating imaginary line. Following it would lead me to my designated room.

""Thanks for the ride,"" I told her.

""You're welcome,"" Vi replied. Out of Janji's sightline, she made a subtle hand gesture, and my glasses alerted me to an incoming message titled ""Read Later!""

I looked at her and she gave me a slight nod.

Upon entering the building, I discovered Janji lived a few doors down from mine. Despite him sticking like a sore thumb, the other human seemed to ignore his presence. After setting my luggage down I took a moment to explore the center's facilities. Beyond the expected laundromat, dining hall, and multipurpose hall, the block also had a gym.  The call of the weights was too strong to resist, so I squeezed in a solid workout before returning to my room.

After a refreshing shower, I sank into the plush bed. The window to my right had darkened to simulate a day-night cycle lasting for venlil 20-hour ""timepaw."" As the guidebook had suggested, I have also set my clock to an ad-hoc time system where each ""hour"" lasted 50 Earth minutes. It should help me to stay oriented on this unchanging planet.

I almost forgot to read Vi's note. Deciding that it was the best time, I opened it.

""Hi Johan, 

Janji has stayed here several Timepaws without incident. The one episode with the therapist happened just once at the beginning of his therapy. However, for caution's sake, try not to be alone with him in confined spaces. In any case, he has a tracker on him, like Vani during his weeks on Earth.""

I thought back to Janji's encounter with the krakotl Nurlel and Kaisal. He hadn't resorted to violence then and hopefully not now. 

""Of course, we didn't leave him in the refugee center alone, you can find the details of Janji's case worker below. Feel free to contact them if you have concerns or want to change your housing to put a distance between you and Janji.""

I tried to catch up on the news, but headlines about the trial of Kalsim, the krakotl General who invaded my planet, soured my mood. So I ended up napping instead.

The chime of my room's doorbell jolted me awake. A quick glance through the camera inset in my glasses revealed Janji standing outside. 

I slid the door open, revealing the venlil in front of me.

""Johan,"" his greeting sounded more like an attendance roll call than a casual hello. ""May I come in?""

Recalling Vi's note I suggested. ""How about we grab a meal in the dining hall?""

""If that's what you'd prefer,"" Janji responded,

As we exited the building, the skies of Venlil Prime remained in a warm glow even at ""19 o'clock"" by my adjusted timekeeping. With humans everywhere, the refugee complex felt like a home away from home. The dining hall served a welcoming environment that offered free meals to all residents. They even had ovo-lacto vegetarian options.

As we entered the dining hall, the sound of my boots reverberated off the tile floor, contrasting with the soft clicking of Janji's clawed feet. The smell of familiar spices infused the air, giving me a comforting scent from home. The hall had several long tables with benches, a scattering of people at each, either eating or engrossed in conversation.

Only humans staffed the food counter. The screen showed the menu, written in multiple human languages. They didn't offer many choices here, perhaps a byproduct of the free meals. Today's options included vegan pesto pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and vegetarian carbonara featuring plant-based protein cubes.

""I'll go for the carbonara,"" I announced.

""I'll have the same,"" Janji added.

The worker hesitated. ""This dish contains eggs and dairy. Are you sure?""

""Yes,"" Janji confirmed.

We filled our trays, grabbed cups of water, and made our way to a secluded table in the far corner of the hall. As we sat, it felt like the space between us expanded. Janji skewered a piece of pasta with his fork and took a bite.

""I've had eggs and dairy before,"" he remarked. ""They have a unique flavor that I enjoyed somewhat.""

""Doesn't dairy upset your stomach?"" I inquired.

He paused, looking at his meal, and realization dawned on him. ""So that explains why I've been feeling gassy.""

""Yes,"" I chuckled, ""even many humans have trouble digesting dairy.""

Janji took another forkful of pasta and then shifted the conversation. ""Johan, I need your opinion regarding Vani and me.""

My eyebrow arched. ""Go on.""

Setting his fork down, he looked at me. ""We never broke things off, and now I'm considering how best to end our relationship.""

A part of me thought his words should bring relief, Janji breaking up with Vani would simplify our lives. But it didn't feel right for me to welcome this news.

""You still love him, though, don't you?"" I sought to clarify.

He let out a sigh. ""Yes, I did love Vani, and I still do. But seeing him again after returning to our homeworld made me reevaluate many things.""

Janji's eyes wandered to the large windows of the dining hall, settling on a group of human children chasing each other on a playground.

""When Vani embraced me back in the spaceport. It felt like... finding missing pieces of myself,"" he continued. ""However, the deeper I delve into that emotion, the more I question whether I deserve such happiness. I committed terrible acts on that farm, acts that I believe make me unworthy of love, particularly from a fellow venlil.""

Intrigued and concerned, I set my fork aside. ""Are you comfortable telling me about... what you did?""

After taking another bite of pasta as though gathering his thoughts, he spoke. ""On that farm, not every venlil came there through raids. Some were born into that hell, and I played a role in their creation.""

His words landed like a gut punch, robbing me of my appetite. ""That's... gosh... I'm sorry you had to go through that Janji. I... can't even begin to imagine how difficult that experience must have been for you, Janji.""

""That's why I think being with Vani might not be fair to him,"" he said.

His reasoning weighed on me. Had he confessed to a diminished attraction to Vani, I would gladly accept that. But...I couldn't let him break up with Vani for that reason. ""The real question is,"" I said. ""Can't you be with him, or you won't you? Nothing is stopping you from reestablishing where your relationship has been cut short""

""Vani deserves someone whole, someone who hasn't been tainted by the predators. Even a human would be a more fitting match for him than I am,"" Janji mused.

Okay, that hits too close to home. I hope he didn't notice me flinching.

""Your past may have fractured you, Janji, but you can piece yourself back together, step by step. And you don't have to do it alone.""

Janji's eyes crossed and met mine head-on. He no longer looked at me askance, and it reminded me of Vani's gaze. ""I'll never return to who I was before my captivity.""

""You don't need to be your former self to deserve love,"" I emphasized. ""What happened to you will leave scars, indelible marks, but they don't make you unworthy of affection or intimacy.""

""What should I do next then?"" he asked.

""Speak to Vani. Share your fears and concerns. Let him make his own choice about whether you're deserving of his love,"" I advised.

Janji's eyes fell to his pasta again, and for a long, silent moment, he seemed to be journeying through the maze of his inner world. When he looked up, it was as if the ambiance in the dining hall had changed, all lights dimmed except for the space between us.

""I'll try."" he said.

[NPD] Walrus Audio Slotva,guitarpedals,16zywwb,2023-10-04 17:16:45,64,0.96,13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16zywwb,happymeal98,,"I feel like I'm late to the party after seeing the original SLO on everyone's boards a couple of years ago. Now that it's being discontinued and heavily discounted, I could not pass it up. Also, this being my first pedal order direct from a company (as opposed to Guitar Center or Amazon), I get to enjoy all the little perks like the photo of this guy, a tin of picks, an I Love You sticker, etc. 

This is replacing my EHX Oceans 11. That's a fine pedal, but after starting to play on a very sparse church band, I needed a good ambient reverb to fill all the musical gaps, and the Oceans is not that pedal, as hard as I tried to make it. Overdoing any of the Oceans reverbs seemed to introduce too many unwanted and boomy frequencies, and turning up the EQ would make it obviously digital sounding. So I'd been eyeing a good dedicated ambient reverb.

Having 3 presets on the Slotva is perfect. I think I can use the Dark mode to dial in subtle default reverb, the Rise for longer ambient texture, and Dream with the mix all the way up for swells without ""the cheapest volume pedal from Amazon,""  should I choose. I was mainly interested in the Rise and Dream modes but I'm already loving the Dark mode, it adds so much depth. 

I'm just beginning to explore what the X and Depth knobs can do but the possibilities seem endless. I'm partial to a very subtle modulation on the warp setting. All the YouTube reviews definitely featured strong modulation but just a little is perfect for me. A lot of Reddit posts about the SLO were negative and mentioned noise, but I don't find this very noisy, and my needs are simple so I'm very happy with it.

New signal chain: Mooer Yellow Comp --> Valeton volume/exp --> EHX Eddy --> EHX Soul Food --> Boss Angry Driver --> Zoom MS-70CDR --> EHX Canyon --> Boss TR-2 --> Walrus Slotva

I might use the Oceans 11 now for my acoustic rig with Echo mode for a simple delay/reverb."
ALEX HOLLAND: Race Based Division,ConservativeKiwi,16m38zz,2023-09-18 14:30:12,26,0.93,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeKiwi/comments/16m38zz/alex_holland_race_based_division/,Ford_Martin,Opinion,"[https://www.bassettbrashandhide.com/post/alex-holland-race-based-division](https://www.bassettbrashandhide.com/post/alex-holland-race-based-division)

 Race based special treatment rather than treatment based on need (for any ethnicity) is becoming a real issue. Two out of every three voters believe NZ has become more divided.  Here are some of the rights & funding ring-fenced by one human attribute (ancestry), many of which have been introduced under this Labour government: 

* Labour announced 12 new HIGH protection areas in Auckland’s Hauraki Gulf to ‘protect and restore marine ecosystems’, while  STILL allowing only Maori to fish in them. They are not marine reserves; they are race based exclusive fishing zones. 
* Te  Whatu Ora is using tax payer money for Maori & Pacific of any age  (only Maori & Pacific ethnicity) to receive free advice  and ‘management’ (including free medicines) at pharmacies for certain  conditions. 
* Reduced/removed rates for Maori landowners under the Local Government (Rating of Whenua Maori) Amendment Act 2021:  1. write off rates owing  2. remove rates altogether for land owned but not developed  3. reduce any remaining rates 
* The new $26 million visitor centre for Punakaiki rocks given to local Iwi who then they charge for entry. 
* New guidelines from Pharmac reveal that “Maori are the priority population”. Essentially, those with Maori ethnicity will now  be guaranteed priority treatment ahead of others with greater health needs. 
* Iwi allowed their own justice system, which often does not go in the victim’s favour and gives lenient outcomes to offenders. 
* Auckland surgeons must now consider ethnicity in prioritising patients for operations giving priority to Maori and Pacific  Island patients (contrary to the Human Rights Act 1993). 
* Since May 2023 only Maori & Pacifica are allowed to get GP referrals for free counselling. 
* New  Zealand Health Strategy 2023 should be equally about all New Zealanders  but focuses on 'Inequity for Maori'. ‘Maori’ or ‘Iwi’ are mentioned 169  times while  ‘European’ is mentioned 4 times. 
* The  Department of Internal Affairs has released a proposal for a new way to  regulate social media and traditional media platforms  that will control what can and cannot be discussed online. However,  Maori are given elevated status in a co-governing role within the  regulatory body. Maori are granted protections to ""express themselves  freely,"" a privilege not given to any other New Zealander.  The proposal will place Maori at the heart of the decisions about what  New Zealanders are allowed to say. 
* Labour have decided that rather than looking for low price and minimum risk, government agencies need to ENSURE 8% of government  contracts go to Maori business. Only Maori can apply for *all* government contracts, everyone else is restricted to 92% of them. 
* $560 million tax payer funding to support Maori in getting the free Covid vaccine, including cash incentives for Maori to get  vaccinated. Also, a Covid vaccine ‘Priority Access Code’ was made available if you were Maori. 
* $438 million in tax payer funding given to upgrade privately owned marae across the country (510 projects - 358 marae, from  a ‘range’ of crown funds including from the Covid funds). 
* Labour set aside $7.75 million for truancy issues for Maori & Pacific students. 
* All employees from the Department of Conservation will get paid $3500 (of tax payer money) if they attend a Maori language  course. 
* Labour have changed the rules so if  Maori or Pacific Islanders make up over half of a GP's clients they get an increase in funding. If the proportion is 49%  or below, they get no increase.
* Three  waters proposal will give Maori 50% voting rights (with only 16%  ‘opting’ as Maori) and power of veto over all water.  Labour spent $14 million tax payer dollars on increasing Iwi/Maori  understanding of the changes, including a $220 per hour ‘strategic  advisor’ in Maori. 
* New  water services entity amendment bill (for 3 waters) states that public  submissions (Community Priority Statements) ‘may’  be considered. In contrast, the Water Services Entities (WSE’s) ‘must’  respond directly to Te Mana o te Wai Statements and ‘must’ include a  plan how the Water Services Entities intends to give effect to Te Mana o  te Wai Statements - the new “Community Priority  Statements” fall well short of the powers provided to local Maori  through Te Mana o te Wai statements. This is what Labour is not telling  you about as these are at the operational level, unlike the (50%)  c\*o-governance at the Regional Representative Groups  level. 
* Labour giving Maori access to funding for their legal costs to claim the Seabed & Foreshore, from mean high tide out to 12  nautical miles.  Opponents to Maori claims must fund their own legal costs. 
* $7.3 million tax payer dollars to make new screening process for cervical cancer screening free for Maori and Pacific Island  woman but anyone else pays $40-$60. 
* Labour funded $107,280 in taxpayer money to a racist stage show about murdering James Cook, his descendants and 'white men  like him’ with pig hunting knives. 
* Requirement  for staff to take into account a student’s cultural identity when  awarding passing grades; rather than their individual  merit. 
* Labour announced 20 per cent of commercial spectrum to be given to Maori, a permanent Maori spectrum entity will be established  and $75 million of funding will go towards development. 
* Maori  get free bowel screening from 55 years old. Also, Andrew Little  announced Maori will get superior access to bowel screening  etc. 
* Maori and Pacifica are automatically entitled to free flu injections over 55 years of age, aged 30 & over are eligible for  a free extra Covid booster and free anti-viral Covid treatment over the age of 50 (for everyone else it is 65 & over). 
* Labour has prioritised Plunket care for Maori and Pacifica, all other ethnicities have been deprioritised.  
* Labour  using tax payer funds during a cost-of-living crisis & record debt  to re-name streets, parks & government departments  to Maori names – no cost/benefit justification given. 
* Labour  spent tax payer money to reformat the New Zealand passports so that now  Te Reo is before any English rather than after  it - no cost/benefit justification given, and now every border control  in the world has to sift through a foreign language to read the passport  (reducing efficiency). 
* Maori don’t have to score mid to high 90’s to pass exam to get into medical school. 
* Only Maori can legally collect particular shell fish in particular areas. 
* Auckland Council is aiming to have 5 percent of the value of all direct contracts awarded to diverse suppliers – Maori and/or  Pasifika-owned business or social enterprises.  
* Auckland Transport's target is to have 2 percent of the value of procurement spend with Maori-owned businesses by the end of  2023. 
* Watercare aims for 5 percent of total spend to be with Maori businesses by the end of the 2025 financial year.  
* Powers given to Maori to close public National parks (e.g. Whirinaki Conservation Park rahui restricting all access for people  from outside the immediate community had been invoked by Ngati Whare). 
* Without consulting anyone, Tuhoe had removed 15 huts from the Ureweras and planned to remove the other 33. 
* Labour deciding what input Maori (only) should have in immigration policy. 
* Labour removed rights voters had to trigger a local binding referendum – e.g. Maori wards. 
* Labour's Local Government Minister trying to get 50% of Council seats to be held by Maori. 
* $12 million government support for Maori landowners to invest in growing sheep milk industry. 
* Report  by the Auditor-General on the $290 million ""Strategic Tourism Assets  Protection Programme"": The Tourism Recovery Minister  decided to fund all tourism businesses that scored more than 15 out of  30 points in the assessment process. They also decided to fund all  eligible Maori tourism businesses, including those that scored less than  15 out of 30 points in the assessment process.  
* Labours Budget for 2020 had $1 billion to improve outcomes for Maori in response to Covid-19. 
* $1.1 billion for Maori in Budget 2021. 
* 2022  Budget: An extra $26m (now $155m in total) for “Progressive  Procurement” – i.e. favouring Maori-owned businesses as government  contractors. $118m in “advisory services” for farmers and Maori land  owners. $580m for “Maori Health and wellbeing” including $188m for the  new Maori Health Authority. $20m establishing new “Iwi-Maori Partnership  Boards” (i.e. introducing co-governance to  the new health system). A $1 billion “Maori Budget” including: $91m on  Maori trades, training, and cadetships, $3m for “marae connectivity”,  $5m for Iwi/Maori teachers. $200m for Maori education. $28m for Maori  “language, culture and identity”. $162m for Maori  organisations to reduce emissions, including $36m for “matauranga  \[traditional knowledge\]-based approaches to reducing biological  emissions” and $30m for “Maori Climate Action”.  $178m for councils  dealing with RMA reform with a new “National Maori Entity”  to co-govern resource management. 
* Maori have been allocated a total of $825 million in 2023 Wellbeing Budget. 
* 2023 Budget: Te Matatini (Maori performing arts festival) has its annual funding increased from $2.9 million per year to $34  million over the next two years.  
* Money  set aside for poor people is being taken from the community services  card fund to give Maori and only Maori women a $50  Prezzy card who turn up for their pregnancy assessment. That means if  you have 1% Maori ancestry and are rich, you will still get a $50 Prezzy  card (from the fund for the poor) because of your trace of Maori  ancestry, not because you need it. Not available for anyone  actually in need that doesn’t have Maori ancestry. 
* Labour  splashed tax payer money on Warriors match tickets or  food vouchers  for Maori and Pasifika who hadn’t filled in their census forms. $2  million was budgeted for handing out support vouchers to get  non-responding individuals and households to complete the census. 
* Tax payer money for ‘Whanau to achieve their aspirations' through Whanau Ora commissioning agencies. 
* Free hospital parking tickets to Maori with a family member in hospital.   
* Maori private business given tax payer money & loans – e.g. Wai Ariki Hot Springs and Spa: $14 million given  to it and an additional $38 million dollar tax payer loan. 
* Primary Healthcare operations/organisations paid $25 per patient to screen Maori & Pacific for Cardiovascular. 
* Specialist Education is scaled where Maori & Pacifica leap frog others for specialist education support. 
* Labour  handed out $70 million in tax payer dollars to set up 30 Iwi lead  community panels instead of courts for Maori offenders.  Also, the Police Commissioner has established a 21-member Maori Focus  Forum that not only co-designs policing strategy for dealing with Maori  offenders, but also plays a “governance role”. The end result of this  partnership with Iwi is that Police “live up  to the joint expectations of those partners, to improve long term  wellbeing for Maori who come to Police attention.” In other words, Maori  justice is all about the offender – ensuring they have a positive  outcome. There is little regard for the victim. A violent  attack that sent a tourist to hospital resulted in no arrests, no  charges, no court, no sentence – only a chat with a community panel of  iwi. It seems the Police have now become “an inclusive partner for Iwi  Maori”. As a result, offenders who are Maori now  have a different pathway – one that looks past the victim to embrace  the culture of the offender.  
* Probation Officers being told to move away from recommending imprisonment for Maori & Pacific Islanders. 
* Labour  launched a $98 million dollar strategy to reduce Maori  over-representation in prisons in August 2019. By 2022 the proportion  of Maori in prison had increased. Meantime, Marama Davidson (leader of  Greens party) stated “I am a prevention violence minister. I know who  causes violence in the world, it is white cis men”. 
* The  Plant Variety Rights Bill introduces a Maori Plant Varieties Committee.  It can block plant varieties being registered and  the bill says ‘A person must not be appointed as a member of the  committee unless, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the person is  qualified for appointment, having regard to that person’s knowledge of  matauranga Maori.'
* Maori party put on their website that ‘it is a well-known fact that Maori are genetically superior’. To date, no apology has  been given. 
* Labour  is removing or reducing biodiversity protection restrictions for Maori  land (changing FNDC SNA mapping), but does this extend to anyone else? 
* Labour  has dedicated $18 million tax payer dollars (over four years) for  iwi-based events and resources that support whanau, hapu and iwi to grow  and lead  their practices and customs relating to te kahui o Matariki/Matariki  Public Holiday. 
* Government lead Mapping for Sites and Areas of Significance to Maori (SASM) didn’t involve Farmers consultation – Timura council  alone has identified 4000 property owners whose lands fits into the 5 categories of SASM regulations (sacred areas). 
* A  fund administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and  Employment invests in projects designed to strengthen capability,  capacity, skills and networks between Maori and the science and  innovation system. 
* Parliament's  new 'Te Kahui Mouri' (2 wooden Maori poles) unveiled in July 2023 cost  tax payers $500,000, described as ""tone-deaf""  during a cost-of-living crisis when Kiwis are ""being asked to tighten  their belts"". 
* Counsellors  being told they can only accept young people & Maori &  Pacifica. Also, a psychologist in Wellington said that hospitals are  referring Maori & Pacific  Islanders to private psychologist and the businesses are losing money  because they often don’t turn up. Any other ethnicity can only be  referred to the public health system, there is a 5-month waiting list  unless they pay for private care themselves. 
* Police and the government turn a blind eye to illegal occupation of private land only if under Maori protest occupation (e.g. Ihumatao & property on the banks of the Taipa River). 
* $55  million fund for media to promote that the Treaty of Waitangi is a  partnership - forty percent of the first allocations  went to projects benefiting Maori journalism. The fund prevents an  opposing point of view to the Labour government’s race-based program. 
* An Independent Maori Statutory Board has been established tasked with representing the views of Maori at the governance level  in councils. 
* The  Hauraki Gulf Forum voted 11-7 in favour of changing its composition to  that of a 50:50 co-governance authority with mana  whenua and ‘others’. It is also proposing to develop its own statutory  plans, that could prevail over council policies and central government  decision-making, for all matters in respect of the Gulf. Although the  elected members voted 7-5 against the proposals,  six more votes were collected from the tangata whenua appointed members  making the final vote 11-7 in favour of the proposals. 
* $49,999 towards an Indigenised Hypno-soundscape to take you to the ‘imagined worlds of our Korero Purakau’. 
* The Health Coalition Aotearoa claiming ‘The Burden of obesity has been disproportionately carried by Maori and Pacifica’ is  a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. 
* The  Canterbury Regional Council (Ngai Tahu Representation) Bill setting a  significant precedent for unelected iwi representation. 
* $100 million regional employment scheme to focus on Maori & Pasifika people. 
* The Maori Health Authority (Te Aka Whai Ora) is spending more than $1.15 million a month on contractors and consultants. The  Maori Health Authority will have veto rights over the entire health system; Maori patients to be prioritised over non-Maori. 
* Even before the Pae Ora (Health Reform) legislation came into effect, $22 million was allocated to establishing the Maori Health  Authority board headed up by Nanaia Mahuta's sister Tipa. 
* In 1997 the New Zealand Government returned the rights of greenstone (pounamu) ownership to Te Rūnanga o Ngai Tahu. Therefore,  all greenstone found becomes the right of Iwi to obtain & sell. 
* In  conservation, an Options Developments Group set up by the Department of  Conservation to better recognise the ‘Treaty partnership’  recommends “the delegation, transfer and devolution of functions and  powers within the conservation system to tangata whenua”. 
* Waitangi  Tribunal’s Wai 262 report categorises as Maori ‘taonga’ a wide range of  ‘treasures’ including intellectual property  rights, genetics, and all living species in the country – both native  and introduced. In 2020, $6.2 million was allocated to develop a Treaty  partnership programme to ensure Maori ‘participate in, benefit from and  make decisions’ over anything identified ‘taonga’. 
* A 91.75% majority vote to change Playcentre Aotearoa’s constitution has been overruled due to Maori co-governance vote having  ultimate power. 
* Labour quietly slipped through legislation that empowers Iwi (only Maori) to legally run roadblocks. 
* Labour announced a $730 million Maori housing budget to build 1000 homes and repair 700 owner-occupied homes over four years. 
* 68 public schools’ ownership moving to Ngati Toa Rangatira. 
* The Mahi Whakaara programme is part of the Maori Trades and Training Fund (MTTF), a $18.5 million government leg up for Maori  jobseekers. 
* Labour announced $38 million will go to strengthening existing initiatives in Maori and Pacific communities for family and  sexual violence prevention. 
* Tax payer funds committed to develop a specific Maori Climate Strategy and Action Plan. 
* Kainga  Ora spent $204,897 on koha between 2019-2021 (interact with marae or  have someone perform a ceremonial role, majority  of time it has been a monetary contribution). That is just one  government agency, what other agencies have given money to Iwi? What  other cultures have received equivalent gifts – if any? 
* Maori Development Minister Willie Jackson says Labour will invest $25 million into the Cadetships programme, delivered by Te  Puni Kōkiri. 
* Te  Pae Tawhiti programme which supports research and innovation in the  Maori economy is getting a further $27.6 million investment  over the next four years. 
* $25.9 million funding for Ngai Tahu to reduce young South Island Maori in state care. 
* Labour funding polytechnic to convert its workbooks and assessments for its level 3 automotive engineering course to Te Reo  Maori. 
* Labour  is allocating $6.5 million into a programme set to enhance Maori  employment outcomes in the research, science and innovation  workforce. 
* Planning  laws to be taken from local councils – given to 14 co-governed  entities. The Herald reports, Labour has decided that  there will be 14 regional planning committees throughout New Zealand  comprising representatives of the local government and of Maori. 
* The  new Maori Health Authority has a budget of half a billion dollars and  CEO Riana Manuel has allocated $100 million of that  to support centuries-old treatments called “maramataka” - the Maori  tradition of using the moon and stars to help treat mental health  issues. 
* Nanaia Mahuta was associate minister when her husband's firm was awarded $72,999 Government contract to facilitate six meetings  (hui) and 14 workshops to engage with Maori and to provide a ""high-level overview"" of the agency's Auckland housing projects. 
* Labour announced a $80 million Maori media strategy. 
* The Reserve Bank is looking to use its position and insights to improve access to capital for Maori (only). 
* Auckland Council uses rates for Maori outcomes funding & Tūpuna Maunga Operational Plan. 
* Cyclone Gabrielle: Maori given $15 million to support a Maori-led recovery of flood-hit communities. 
* Pacifica  & Maori patients in South Auckland are to be seen by a medical  professional on the day they seek help, pushing everyone  else further down the list. 
* Health minister has set aside $2.2 million on ‘PR consultants’ on new Maori Health authority. 
* Think tank Tokona Te Raki - Maori Futures Collective has launched a new action plan to remove streaming from schools by 2030  because they consider it ‘racist’; rather than advancing the top tier students, they would prefer to hold back potential. 
* Te Kainga rental building - quality two and three bedroom apartments for Wellingtonians that are below market rate for the  inner city. Applicants who work for Maori organisations are prioritised. 
* Special provisions for Maori culture: Kindergarten Teachers Accept Latest Collective Agreement Offer including ‘a cultural  allowance for kaiako Maori’. 
* Students who have some Maori or Pasifika heritage not only have access to the scholarships designated for them, but also have  the opportunity to apply for the same scholarships that a non-Maori/Pasifika can. 
* Only  Maori get to choose what electoral role they are on and swap back and  forth at any time. Maori seats were meant to be  abolished in 1879 when the rule was removed that you had to own land  under your personal name (inadvertently excluding groups/tribes) to be  able to vote. 
* Labour  has encouraged integrating Te Reo into English to normalise ‘Pidgin  English’, rather than supporting both as separate  important languages in their own right. Labour used this Pidgin English  to communicate important announcements throughout Covid19 & other  emergencies – whether you understood it or not. Rawiri Waititi called  all non-Maori New Zealanders who did not speak Maori  ""dumb"". 
* Hone Harawira says it is appropriate for Maori (only) to eat Kereru (protected native pigeon). 
* Labour has spent tax payer money on introducing a school ‘history’ curriculum that supports the Maori view of New Zealand to  indoctrinate children into ‘Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles & partnership’. 
* Special tax rates e.g. Maori ‘Charitable Trust’. 
* State Funding proposed for ‘A new fund – Te Putea Whakangawari Korero a-Tiriti / Treaty Facilitation Fund – should be available  to facilitate party and candidate engagement with Maori communities, in ways appropriate for Maori.’ 
* The  tax payer paid free school lunches programme was given an extra $323  million in the 2023 budget to keep it running. 48%  of students receiving the free lunches are Maori. A Treasury report was  hugely critical of it with found no evidence of impacting attendance or  benefiting akonga Maori. 
* Maori Party calling for Maori (only) to get pension to start at 57 years old. 
* Covid Response funds are spent on:
