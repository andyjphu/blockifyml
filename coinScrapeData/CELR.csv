Got Jumper by Hunters,SchreckNet,1i4vdc3,2025-01-19 05:08:58,11,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1i4vdc3/got_jumper_by_hunters/,_hufflebutt,Report,"Spoilers, I lived.

So old mate's come up from Syd for work, he's a Tor and we used to run in the same circles and coterie for a while. We catch up to shoot the shit like the old days and we meet at the station to head into the city for the night.

There's something nostalgic about the train so we're waiting for it arrive (fuckin delays as always) and we notice these odd looking guys kinda just staring at us from one of the benches. Don't think too much of it but keep my guard up a little just in case but knowing the area I just assumed they were waiting for their dealer or something.

Anyway, we're talking shit while we wait when one of the blokes comes up to us and starts asking if we have change. We both do the usual pat our pockets and say ""nah sorry mate"" when he goes and pulls something out of his pocket. Look, I was stupid and assumed a knife because that's pretty common here but iinstead he pulls put some kinda spray can.

We shoulda acted faster but before we knew it he's spraying this aerosol shit at as that smells like a dodgy massage parlor, like incense and fancy oils and shit, my mate catches the worst of it but I get some on my arm and it burns like hell. Felt like he's just torched my arm with a flame thrower and the skins already peeling off - my mates face is just as bad.

I see two more guys coming and I don't know what the fuck we've just been hit with so I grab my mate by the collar and run, dragging us both off the platform and onto the tracks. Short run and we're jumping the fence but he's looking worse for wear and half blind and my left arm's all fucked up so we run into the nearby woods.

Now this is wear it pays to know your turf.

We find a spot to kinda hide and with his auspex he can hear at least 3 guys coming our direction but I got a secret weapon. See I know a whole family of roos live around these parts and so use my ever valuable animalism to put of the call.

I draw the attention of the first guy with the fucking spray bottle and he comes running our way when BAM! He's so fucking later locked on me he runs right past the room that gives him a full on lean back, double barrel kick. Dude's toppled over into a tree with his side torn open and some intestines peaking out.

His other two buddies come running to his screams and even with half his face melted, my mate is still a killer shot. So he's got a humble little rock in his hand and revs up like a cricket pitch backed up by fuck-off amounts of Celerity and let's loose, splitting of the hunters open.

Last one's panicked to hell now not knowing what the fuck is going on and running around in the dark until he bumps into one of the other roos and gets fucking disembowelled on the spot.

By now the first one's gone into shock and mostly bled out. We suck out what little blood's still left and good in their bodies but the worst of the injuries still remain so whatever the burned us with can fuck right off.

Anyway, I put the call out to my lovely little Hecata friend to let her know and to collect the corpses, send word to the Baron and cancel our plans for the evening as help drag my mate back to mine to recover.

Oh yeah and made sure the check the bodies first. No forms of ID on any of them, knives and 9mm pistols (that's fucking rare here in Aus by the way), uv flash lights, those weird spray cans and a burner phone with nothing on it but some vague messages about being ""ready"".

So yeah, fucking pissed they ruined our night but at least we're alive. We're recuperating back at my haven, chilling with the cats and cracking out the PS2 to play King of Fighters like the old days while he tells me about some Malk chick he's crushing on down in Syd while I write this.

These would be the first hunters round these parts in over 10 years, they were equipped but not the best of brightest so I'm thinking someone smarter is backing some goons. In the meantime I've got my animal network and security cranked up while recover.

Anyway, stay safe out there folks.

How Can I Transfer Moons In My Metamask From Arbitrum Nova to Arbitrum One So That I Can See The Actual Balance?,CryptoCurrency,1hlrhg8,2024-12-24 20:57:16,5,0.67,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hlrhg8/how_can_i_transfer_moons_in_my_metamask_from/,LatinumGirlOnRisa,DISCUSSION,"This is a busier subreddit than the Moons subreddit so I thought it would be better to ask my question in here;

I can see the Moons on Arbitrum Nova in my Metamask on my Android phone but of course I can't see the balance because of the migration to Arbitrum One

I want to transfer them over to my Arbitrum One wallet account but so far anyway the only instructions I found were the ones linked to the tutorial for using the Celer bridge to move Moons between Arbitrum Nova & Arbitrum One 

I have ETH on both networks but I don't remember ever moving crypto without choosing how much I want to move and I know we can choose to move a ""maximum"" amount but I didn't know if that option was available to choose if the wallet can't detect how much is in there. and really, I'm still a Moons 'shrimp' but I'd still hate to lose any amount of cryptocurrency to the dark abyss of the cryptoverse.

if anyone has a working knowledge of this process re: moving Moons between these 2 networks from  *within* Metamask please chime in, thanks!

**Veldoran**

>During the first Academy War, three of the Great Academies turned traitor and sided with Veldoran against the academy alliance – Chaoswood, Poisonwater, and Giant Thunder Hall. Poisonwater betrayed Veldoran, and Giant Thunder Hall relented and switched sides when Marcus killed their leader on the battlefield, but Chaoswood… Chaoswood was razed to the ground, its treasures looted, and its people scattered

...

>“Aren’t you (General Marcus) a friend of Crystal Mountain? The savior who drove Veldoran’s army away when the academy was about to fall to his forces?”

>Timijan thought Crystal Mountain would ask *him* for help? Marcus counted himself lucky they weren’t sending a constant stream of assassins aiming for his life. Probably because they were too worried what would happen to their precious tablets…

**Adept Ranks**

rank1 - apprentice (no internal mana reserves)

rank2 - mage (""most mages remain at rank two all their lives"")

rank3 - logos (their logos will resonate with rank5+ spirits and notice it, can ""twist and modify spells they had collected from ancient masters"", minor powers have \~one)

rank4 - foundation (level up by ""condensing their logos core into a spirit"")

rank5 - spirit manifestation (""that’s when mages start developing truly original magic"", only academies that were founded by a rank5+ are allowed to call themselves Great)

rank6 - unification stage (Gaius the Great Sea Academy consul/leader and Marcus ""battle-brother"" Beortan Samchel)

rank7 - ? (“I’m sorry, junior brother Beortan,” Marcus told him with a small smile. “You’re still one step behind me.”)

rank8 - oversoul (Shamshir duke of the Fire Orchid Kingdom, does not have any obvious tells like rank5, As far as Marcus knew, there wasn’t a single rank eight mage in the entire Silver League.)

rank9 - ?

**awakened fox**

that he helped shelter from a chaos storm promised help, ""if fate wills it""

**Elid**

the merchant son, had some hard to detect ""ridiculously specific thing"" that is special about him, Marcus gave him a sealed letter

>“If you can pass the examination without using this letter, you should keep it to yourself. Burn it, hide it, whatever… but if you are about to be rejected, well. This letter will *make sure* that Crystal Mountain Academy will want you in. I make no promises as to what happens afterwards.”

(unrelated scene)

>“M-My fool son…” Pellast (the merchant) stammered. “You will surely drive me into an early grave one of these days, I can just tell.”

**Timijian**

leader of the White Pine Mercenary Guild, a ""battle-maniac"" \~rank5 in heavy fur clothes of some great beast and armed with a fancy-looking sword scheduled a duel with Marcus ""in a few months at the Great Sea Academy"" (Marcus hoped he'd get distracted/injured by some other battle until then...)

**Heritage Tablet**

Titus of Great Tree Academy wants Marcus to create one based on his Soul Tree Technique because the one and only they have is from the nonhuman founder (elf/?) with a

>mentality and understanding of the world sufficiently different from the bulk of humanity that most people have issues practicing the technique to a high level

\~2 year deadline, requires special materials he doesn't have yet

theory:

>!Marcus earth spells seem to be very effective, remember the tablets Crystal Mountain Academy were so worried about?!<

**ocher-colored cylinder**

covered in a complicated network of carved lines and patterns, hidden by Celer on the other side of the rift he closed for the king ""Marcus really hoped she didn’t just dump it into a lake or something equally stupid…"" but ""He would be able to find it no matter what she did.""

**Celer**

lesser fairy butterfly friend of Marcus from Dreamwood (one of the six outer planes/heavens/manifolds?) - likes to dust those who displease her with potentially, hallucinogenic dust

**Lake Sher**

>a pair of blue, four-armed humanoids had attacked several groups passing next to the lake, and a son of a wealthy merchant was killed. Marcus couldn’t remember any race matching that description, so if the report was true, it was likely another rift had opened in the area. Might be worth checking out at some point.

**Harpy archipelago main pillar**

>a single mind-bogglingly high pillar of stone rising into the sky, absolutely dwarfing all of the other islands around it. Marcus had to admit there was something unnatural about it.

Great Sea Academy is close located on a large normal island as

>that place was considered too dangerous. Even the harpies avoided settling there.

**the bounty**

on Marcus head, placed on him because he is practicing the Soul Tree Technique. Titus mentioned all previous members of Great Tree Academy that reached rank5 died young, that's why he wants Marcus to create a heritage tablet as soon as possible.

**Silver Aeon**

ancient elvish Empire

>""it is said that the core of their realm was located in the center of our continent, right where the Sea of Leaves currently resides. If so, someone must have gone to great efforts to erase every trace of their existence from the Sea of Leaves. Only the gods know what terrible enemy they provoked to deserve such a fate, and they aren’t saying anything about it.""

...

>“Chaoswood is an old name for our world. You likely know it as Tasloa – the name given to it by the elves of the Silver Aeon. Your magical academies seem to have adopted many of their terms and traditions as their own.”

(maybe related) Titus of Great Tree Academy mentioned

>""in ancient times. It (GTA) was less of an academy, and more of a secretive religious cult."" that ""refused to write down any of their magic, preferring to pass on legacies directly from teacher to apprentice.""

**Sacred/Mystery Oak**

>“Alas, after us Grandfather Trees tried to exterminate humanity and wipe out all traces of civilization on the planet, the gods destroyed most of the wood-related magical traditions on the planet as punishment for our sins.""

the founder of Great Tree Academy first encountered this Mystery Oak spirit-level creature, at that time it *did not* practice the Soul Tree Technique and it was

>only after several generations of interaction with our academy that the tree started to exhibit this feeling of resonance towards our foundational technique. It synchronized with us more and more, and as it did, the effects of its blessing grew ever stronger…

Marcus thought switching foundational technique after reaching rank5+ is impossible

Mystery Oak also knows how their planet looks like from space (he recognized the planet destroyed in the vision as clearly not their own because the landmasses didn't match)

>There were three habitable planets around Tasloa’s star, four if one counted Tasloa’s moon. The other planets were hard to reach, even with magic, so they stayed largely isolated from one another. Only selenite tradeships made regular trips between these planets, and they allowed no passengers aboard their vessels.

**big purple gem**

allowed the Amethyst Academy (old owners of Zenith Academy territory) rank4 founder to contend with rank5. Marcus would like to inspect it if he can find the new owner of it (that killed the rank4 in the Second Academy War)

**extensive basement below the Zenith tower**

>two storage vaults, underground training hall, a whole row of additional student accommodations, sealed passages that connect to a preexisting large cave system.

Entrance warded for now but Marcus intends to check it out

**Soul Tree Technique**

>“Close your eyes,” Marcus said. He closed his eyes too. He would not need them for what was coming next. “Take a deep breath. Breathe out. Feel the air as it leaves your body. Extend your awareness outwards. Try to feel the world around you with your soul.”

>Marcus let his spirit flare out behind him. Although their eyes were closed, Marcus knew that everyone in the vicinity was currently witnessing a massive ghostly oak materialize in the center of their consciousness.

>“Everyone,” Marcus spoke, his voice boring directly into their minds and soul. “Repeat after me: I plant in my soul a seed of a mighty tree. Its roots stabilize the earth. Its branches reach out towards the heavens…”"
How to prepare for your first job as a biostatistician in drug development?,biostatistics,1gn2d2g,2024-11-08 23:45:45,55,0.99,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/biostatistics/comments/1gn2d2g/how_to_prepare_for_your_first_job_as_a/,de_js,,"This guide is by no means exhaustive. Please feel free to comment on it and add further recommendations.

a) Adapt your CV to the job requirements and responsibilities
This is a general recommendation to show your experience and education are relevant to the position of interest. Read the job requirements carefully. For example, are you expected to be proficient in a particular statistical programming language? If you are already proficient in the required skill: Great! List it prominently on your CV. If you are not proficient in the required skill: Try to find out through other job advertisments if this skill is marketable before you learn it. 

b) Become familiar with relevant regulatory guidelines

Where should you start?
Read the ICH E9 and its addendum. They are the most important regulatory guidelines for biostatisticians.

How should you start?
The EMA publishes clinical trial protocols, case report forms, statistical analysis plans and clinical study reports of clinical trials which have been submitted by pharmaceutical companies to support their marketing applications for human medicines. These are in general great resources to learn more about different aspects of clinical trials (e.g. clinical trial design). Go to https://clinicaldata.ema.europa.eu and create an EMA account to get access to the published clinical data. 

One statistical aspect that is crucial in clinical trial design is sample size determination. I would recommend to use this specific aspect as an exercise throughout the following recommendations. 
After you got access to the EMA platform, search and choose a clinical trial of your interest, understand the primary objective and general design of the clinical trial and critically review the documentation and justification of the sample size determination in the Clinical Trial Protocol or Statistical Analysis Plan. Are the regulatory requirements from ICH E9 with respect to the sample size determination met? 

c) Become familiar with key documents in clinical trials
The Clinical Trial Protocol, the Statistical Analysis Plan and the Clinical Study Report are key documents in clinical trials. In general, these documents are (co-)developed and reviewed by biostatisticians. 

Where should you start?
Recommended resources for Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP):
* The SPIRIT 2013 Statement defines standard protocol items for clinical trials.
* The Common Protocol Template provided by TransCelerate BioPharma, Inc. provides proposed harmonised content and streamlined format for CTPs. 

Recommended resources for Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP):
* Guidelines for the Content of Statistical Analysis Plans in Clinical Trials [Gamble C et al., 2017] and its extension for early phase clinical trials [Homer V et al., 2022].
* The Common Statistical Analysis template provided by TransCelerate BioPharma, Inc. provides a common layout and model content for SAP documentation. 

Recommended resources for Clinical Study Report (CSR):
* ICH E3 Guideline (Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports)
* The CONSORT 2010 Statement and its extensions guides reporting of a clinical trial.
* The Common Clinical Study Report template provided by TransCelerate BioPharma, Inc. provides a common and streamlined structure to report data.

You can find reporting guidelines at https://www.equator-network.org/

How should you start?
Go back to the relevant documents of the clinical trial of your interest on the EMA platform and critically review (structure, assumptions, justifications) the section on the sample size determination in the CTP, SAP and CSR using the aforementioned resources as a reference for comparison. Beside checking formal aspects, try to review the underlying assumptions of the sample size calculation? Are they verifiable? Are they adequate? Do you have enough information to replicate the sample size estimation? 

d) Become proficient in the SAS programming language

SAS is still the dominant statistical programming language in the pharmaceutical industry and in contract research organisations up to this date. The R statistical programming language, however, is on the rise in the pharmaceutical industry. 

Where should you start?
SAS offers free access to SAS software in the cloud for students and independent learners: https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html

How should you start? 
I would recommend by starting with a replicated sample size estimation through Monte Carlo simulation, because you would become familiar with the different concepts of SAS: statements, procedures and eventually macros (e.g. DATA statement to generate pseudo-random data for your simulation, PROC PRINT to print the observations of your data set, PROC FREQ to summarize categorical variables, PROC GENMOD to fit a generalised linear model underlying your sample size calculation, etc.). Use the information of the sample size determination in the CTP or SAP of your clinical trial of interest and try to replicate the calculation in SAS through simulation. 

Why is all of this important? 
Having a relevant educational background means that you have enough technical skills. However, you probably lack the knowledge and training to apply your technically skills to a real-world problem in a highly regulated environment where experience is crucial. Familiarising yourself with relevant guidelines and documents and practicing important skills (critical review of statistical aspects, statistical programming, Monte Carlo simulation) will help you perform better in job interviews and ultimately make the transition into the industry much easier.

If you have any question, please do not hesitate to comment."
Revisiting Kindred: The Embraced 28 Years Later PART ONE: Overview,vtm,1g7igmr,2024-10-19 16:54:29,84,0.98,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/vtm/comments/1g7igmr/revisiting_kindred_the_embraced_28_years_later/,replikantka,General Discussion,"The year is 1996, seeing the publishing of *Vampire: The Dark Ages*, the arrest of Ted Kaczynski, the launch of the Mars Global Surveyor probe, and the death of Tupac Shakur...

...And the airing of *Kindred: The Embraced* on Fox.

Short-lived at only one season consisting of eight episodes, the Spelling Television series features the struggles of the Camarilla Prince of San Francisco and his relationship with a Kine detective of the San Francisco police, who learns the secret of the Masquerade. Fox viewed the bones of the show as something of a vampiric *Melrose Place*, and the plots unfold much like a supernatural soap opera, laying the groundwork for later sensation *Buffy The Vampire Slayer,* (which would release a year later to far more success) and acting as a predecessor to the likes of *True Blood*, *Teen Wolf, Angel,* and *The Vampire Diaries*. 

The series received decidedly mixed reviews, both among Kine critics and conflicted members of the Kindred community. There was praise for the complex narrative, slick style, and many of the vampire performances on the show, but it was criticized for shallow writing, outward goofiness, and confusing pilot (we’ll get to it). Among us night creatures, it also drew ire for its flippant use of the Vampire: the Masquerade lore, including but not limited to the following sins:

* Allowing its Kindred to experience daytime - it is established relatively early on that these Kindred can, if they have fed recently enough, spend time out in daylight. My understanding is that this was a budget issue, so as to not have to film all of their scenes at night, but there is some awkward inconsistency involved as to what the limits of this are and the daylight scenes are always jarring. They do, however, use this quality for an interesting scene in episode ~~6~~ 4, which I will talk about when we get there. All Kindred on the show also seem to have the Eat Food quality, as they are shown eating and drinking quite often.
* Not really establishing that different clans have different sets of Disciplines, and showing Kindred of all clans using out-of-clan Disciplines (e.g. the Nosferatu using Celerity, the Toreador Primogen using Protean) while some Kindred don’t seem to use the Disciplines of their clan loadout (for example, to my knowledge we never get to see Cash, the primary Gangrel character, use Protean). While many of the Kindred who are depicted in the series are powerful among their clan, and it isn’t a stretch to believe they’ve picked up some out-of-clan Disciplines along the way, it makes for either bad worldbuilding and/or disrespect for a core aspect of the source material and, more importantly, it muddies the waters on what makes the clans different from each other on a show that doesn’t spend a whole lot of time establishing its clans in the world to those not already familiar with the lore (more on this later). It doesn’t help that the special effects are pretty cheap and notably dated - some Disciplines look cool, such as the haunting silver eyes of an Auspex or Dominate power; the sequences of Kindred shapeshifting into wolves, however, would not be out of place on the cover of an *Animorphs* book. It’s an unfortunate mix of a startling lack of consistency, even when working with source material several years old at that point, and the sort of lofty ambitions which the budget of the show was unable to reach. 
* And then, of course, there is the portrayal of the different clans. I will expand on this in the episode breakdowns, but the show takes some liberties with its portrayals of the six clans represented in the series: Ventrue, Toreador, Brujah, Gangrel, Nosferatu, and Assamite (known in later editions as the Banu Haqim); of special note is the divisive portrayal of the Brujah, which acts as the primary overarching antagonist throughout the series - I believe we have this show to thank for popularizing the “broo-ha” pronunciation of the clan name. As with Disciplines, the primary problem here is ultimately that, while the show does spend time focusing on each clan, the writing fails to clearly differentiate what makes each clan individually special or specify any delineation between clans of vampires aside from the surface-level mob-style conflicts between them, which makes for confusing and sometimes awkward representation if the viewer doesn’t already know what to look for and, for the Lore nerds among us, leads to questions about why they bothered making the show specifically about Vampire: the Masquerade in the first place. 

Gripes about the series notwithstanding, however, its ratings were okay, it got a few decent critical reviews, and the show was considered to hold enough promise that there were plans for a second season, or at least discussion of one with the network. Unfortunately, actor Mark Frankel, who portrayed the Ventrue Prince of the city and garnered much of the positive praise of critics, was killed in a motorcycle accident some months after the airing of season one, putting the final nail in the show’s coffin. 

All that said, now is as good a time as any to admit (in case it wasn’t already abundantly clear) that I love *Kindred: The Embraced*. I’ll be the first to call it a smoldering garbage fire, but watching it again in 2024 reminds me why I found it so endearing. Some parts of it have aged rather, erm, interestingly (*we’ll get to it*), and it commits many a Lore violation (something I’m very passionate about) but I have a soft spot for soap operas, vampire drama, camp taken very, *very* seriously, and petty women with finger-wave hairdos. Consider this part 1 of an overlong, fully biased overview that nobody asked for about a series no one cares about. Note that I’m an obsessive fan so I will be writing things that are unequivocally subjective; I will be too hard on some characters for dumb stuff, give the writing far more credit than it probably deserves, and harp on shit that is probably only the way that I think it is because of my own extrapolations. I’ll even be complimentary of half-baked concepts and \[gasps\] giving the massacring of Vampire: the Masquerade lore the occasional pass. I’m not being objective, professional, or pretending to have the correct takes on anything, but nobody can stop me. You’ve been warned.

**\*\*Full spoilers beyond this point. TW throughout the series for tv-appropriate depictions of blood and murder, discussion of sexual assault/predation and unsubtle representations thereof, sexuality and sexual assault as a metaphor for predation and vampirism, misogyny, racial slurs (specifically the g-slur), toxic and creepy relationships, and the standard WoD back-of-the-rulebook warnings.\*\***

Let’s start with some **Major Characters:**

* **Prince Julian Luna**: The Ventrue Prince of San Francisco, Julian Luna is portrayed as a pragmatic humanist, focused on keeping the myriad Kindred of the Bay Area Camarilla happy and at peace - a monumental task. He is a young Prince, having stepped into the role following the abdication of former Ventrue Prince Archon Raine, and his judgment often errs on the side of caution, humanism, or complacency, a trait he is often chided for by his council. That said, he is not afraid to get his own hands dirty, preferring to lead from the front and making difficult calls with decisive ease - actually, calling it leading from the front is generous: Julian will involve himself personally in any and all Kindred conflicts to the point it classifies as reckless endangerment. Julian is very involved in the mortal world, and in the grand tradition of the Clan of Kings, never hesitates to dip his fingers in a potentially lucrative business venture - often to the benefit of the Ivory Tower. His hold on the Princedom is decidedly shaky, as his controversial laws - namely his mandate against the murder of Kine - make him a target for usurpation, but he is very focused on the Traditions of the Camarilla and very well-connected, allowing him to reliably solidify his power when needed. Julian is portrayed with a stoic charisma, a young paragon of Ventrue leadership in crisp suits whose ties to the mortal world seem to cause him more problems than they solve. He’s compelling, but would probably last about ten minutes in the average V:tM tabletop chronicle. 
* **Det. Frank Kohanek**: A Kine detective of the San Francisco PD investigating Julian Luna as a mobster, and the other main deuteragonist of the series. Though they do some interesting things with him in service of the plot, Frank is boring and blandly-written, with such boilerplate characterization it almost feels like parody - right down to a dead wife and an unhealthy devotion to his career. His main function in the plot is to interact with Julian Luna, who is obligated to keep Frank safe due to a promise he makes in the pilot episode, and to barge his way into the Vampire Conflict of the Week when it inevitably catches the attention of the cops. His portrayal isn’t too bad, but the writing paints him so on the nose that it’s hard to take him seriously. 
* **Det. Sonny Toussaint**: Frank’s partner at the SFPD and the Childe of Julian Luna, Sonny is secretly a Ventrue embedded in the precinct to keep an eye on the San Francisco police, and specifically Frank, for Julian. He is dutiful and a good spy, shown to be able to play both Kine and other Kindred like a fiddle, but he also seems to have a genuine friendship and partnership with Frank, keeping him safe and even secretly giving him information that Julian has kept from him - to the point that he is instrumental in Frank’s discovery of the city’s Kindred and seems to have his own agenda. Sonny is the only person of color on the main cast.
* **Lillie Langtry**: Primogen of the Toreador clan and owner of The Haven, a club and bar, Lillie is the quintessential Rose: immaculately dressed, elegant, well-connected, self-centered, and prone to jealousy. She is Julian Luna’s lover and business partner, offering advice and astute observations of Kindred society, and the two of them seem to have a polyamorous open relationship built on a foundation of mutual respect and very old friendship. There are indications, however, that Lillie may view it more seriously than she lets on and her emotions regarding Julian run deeper than either of them realize, manifesting in pettiness when he starts a relationship with a human journalist. Overall, Lillie is very emotionally complex, but in a way that is decidedly old and inhuman - she often comes across as though she is playacting humanity as a role for the benefit of the public, an affable and alluring exterior of a beautiful woman just waiting to give way to the calculating creature beneath the thin, attractive veneer. 
* **Caitlin Byrne**: A dedicated Kine journalist, Caitlin has a strong sense of duty, even to the point of recklessness. She crosses paths with Julian Luna when interviewing him for the San Francisco Times - having found a strange disconnect between his prolific business ventures and lack of any records of him anywhere - and the two strike up a romantic relationship. A tireless investigative reporter, and later editor of dubious ethics, Caitlin is smart and quick on the uptake, always ready to spring into action in service of her next story and devoted to her career above almost all else. Caitlin’s inclusion on the show makes Frank’s look all the worse in comparison; while they are both straightforward characters, they fill the same role and Caitlin brings more to the table, comparatively, than Frank does: both have reasons by way of their job to cross paths with the Kindred of the city, and both represent a danger to the Masquerade. They both push Julian to his limits, and he sees them both as a conduit to control the Kine of the city and protect his own. The difference is that his dedication to Frank is a somewhat flimsy obligation (I’ll get into it when discussing the pilot), while his relationship with Caitlin is a more organic one, borne from his desire to be closer to a living human, even though it actively endangers and inconveniences him (and in many cases, also makes him come off as intensely creepy and weirdly amoral). Caitlin doesn’t know that Julian is a vampire, and represents something of an indulgence for him which can be exploited by his fellow Kindred, should they find out - making the stakes of the situation much higher.
* **Sasha Luna**: Julian Luna’s great-great-granddaughter and last living relative, Sasha reconnects with Julian at the funeral of her vintner grandfather. Sasha is a wild child, already seeing herself as independent and self-reliant in, seemingly, her early twenties (though her character may be meant to be a teenager - it’s not very clear). She rides a motorcycle and dresses in leathers, with a swarm of curly hair and a mischievous smile, always looking for the next thrill or trouble. Julian invites her to come live with him at his uber-fancy Blue Blood mansion after bailing her out of jail, unwittingly painting a target on her back by association; the danger only intensifies when she develops a fascination with the Gangrel Primogen. Ultimately, Sasha is Embraced as a political move by the Brujah clan, and is forced to reckon with her new existence as one of the Kindred during a brewing war between her newly adopted clan and the uncle who kept dangerous secrets from her. I personally go back and forth about Sasha; she’s written very awkwardly and her character is given little room to breathe by the pacing of the narrative, to the point that she feels more like a plot device than a person. She comes across as obnoxious because her motives are rarely more than one-dimensional and the show has a difficult time establishing emotional stakes for her past the way her Embrace affects Julian. However, she also provides a much-needed baseline both for what a younger Kindred is like (there are other newly-turned Kindred but these are invariably featured in the monster-of-the-week role) and for the contrast between Kine and Kindred and how the Embrace affects a person. It’s a genuinely interesting and classic character concept that is mostly hampered by bad writing; I will expand on this in my episode breakdown. 
* **Eddie Fiori**: The Brujah Primogen and leader of the San Francisco dockworkers’ union, Eddie is ambitious, misogynistic, and domineering, with a square-jawed sneer and an inclination toward leadership through intimidation. A corrupt union boss, Eddie runs his clan like an old-school mobster, bringing in money to the Camarilla through his control of the docks and quietly amassing an army of loyal miscreants. Eddie makes no secret of his opposition to Prince Luna, repeatedly challenging Julian directly at conclaves with open disapproval of the Prince’s ruling methods; ultimately, Eddie wants power over the city and its Kindred and is willing to take what he wants by force. A fun character and well-played recurring foil to the cool and compromising Julian, Eddie’s approach to the Brujah is one best described by Nosferatu Bertram Tung’s estimation of the clan in the video game *Bloodlines*:

>""They're a bunch of malcontents. They get pumped up by rousing the rabble they keep around them, like that's hard. Nothing breeds faster than contempt, and that's what the Brujah are all about. Jealousy and contempt."" 

* **Daedalus**: Julian’s most trusted confidante and Primogen of clan Nosferatu, Daedalus is a reclusive and unflinching enforcer of the Prince’s will in the city, effectively functioning as the city’s Scourge when Julian seems to deem it necessary. Because this series apparently has the budget of a high school theater production, Daedalus seemingly made out pretty well in the Orlock lottery: He’s a nearly featureless bald guy with glued-down eyebrows and weird earlobes stuck to the side of his head. It’s a disappointing visual take for the series’ main Nosferatu, but even though he is rather visually bland and surprisingly human-looking for a Nossie, actor Jeff Kober’s performance lends him an unsettling quality befitting of the curse of the sewer rats. His speech is clipped and deliberate, he never seems to blink, and his facial expressions are intense - the overall effect is like that of the Observers in the mid-00s sci-fi procedural *Fringe*; of someone who is not only inhuman, but in some way interacting with the world in a fundamentally different fashion than those around him. Daedalus is a character of contrasts and hidden depths, alternately shown as one of the most compassionate and caring characters on the show and as someone who can summon the savagery and horror of the Beast on a dime - though not without remorse for its carnage. He is a note-perfect Nosferatu character in many ways, and in classic fashion, an indirect contrast to Lillie’s shadow play of humanity.
* **Cash**: The newly-appointed Gangrel Primogen, Cash is also the personal bodyguard of Julian Luna and the leader of the Gangrel bikers of the city. Cash also takes on the Sheriff role when appropriate, and is shown to be loyal, competent, a quick thinker, and cool under pressure but not without a fiery streak. He is also very social with many of the more recently Embraced Kindred in the city, implying that he himself is a relatively recent Embrace and/or sees himself as a mentor figure of sorts to the newer creatures of the night. He is fiercely protective of his clanmates and takes his job both as Primogen and as bodyguard very seriously, even if he isn’t the most politically adept or subtle Kindred in San Francisco.
* **Archon Raine**: The former Prince of San Francisco and mentor to his Childe, Julian Luna, Archon Raine serves as the Primogen of clan Ventrue. He is portrayed as having stepped down from the position of Prince willingly, allowing Julian to take over while continuing to dispense wisdom and advice behind the scenes - still influential in politics, but no longer the figurehead. This may have been due to optics, as Archon supposedly had a reputation for ruthlessness, bloodhunting, and ruling with an iron fist, but for his part, he seems content with his role out of the spotlight. Archon Raine reads like a casual riff on Marlon Brando in *The Godfather* \- apropos, given the film was invoked often in discussion about the style of the series - with salt-and-pepper hair and a deceptive warmth and smoothness to his line delivery, like he always knows something you do not. Importantly (and confusingly), “Archon” is the character’s name, not his title. 

This is already getting out of hand and I have eight episodes of this shit to cover. In the next post in the series, we will cover the pilot episode of *Kindred: the Embraced*: the good, the stupid, and the recklessly endangering."

[Discussion] Royal Assassin by Robin Hobb Chapters 17-21,bookclub,1fk5o7z,2024-09-18 18:35:45,12,0.94,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1fk5o7z/discussion_royal_assassin_by_robin_hobb_chapters/,fromdusktil,Royal Assassin,"Hello, my fellow assassins-in-training! Welcome back to another exciting discussion of Royal Assassin. We got a couple of big reveals this week, so without further ado, let's get to some summaries!

**Chapter 17**

Fitz is summoned by Shrewd. A letter for Fitz has come from Celerity; Fitz again tries to bring up Molly, Shrewd still won't hear of it. Shrewd promised to do his best by Fitz and he believes a marriage that will give Fitz land and a title is the best for him. We also learn that Regal has been filling Shrewd in on Fitz and Molly, which the king disapproves of. 

During the conversation, we see that Shrewd is more sickly than ever and addicted to several substances, including Smoke and whatever “spiced herbs” are added to his wine. The Fool obeys the king, but is clearly unhappy about the situation. 

After writing a response to Celerity and trying to make himself look bad by mentioning his tremors, he goes for a walk into town and sees Molly. After secretly following her and purchasing the items for an impromptu picnic lunch, he surprises her on the path to town. 

After a romp in the grass, Fitz, ever the master of perfect timing, chooses their post-coitus snuggle time to tell Molly that Shrewd plans on him marrying Celerity and is totally clueless as to why that upset Molly. Molly storms off in tears and Fitz goes home. 

Later, Fitz initially ignores Chade's door, but Chade comes down and gets him. They briefly discuss Fitz's interaction with the king, and Fitz again states that he will only wed Molly. Chade tried to get through to him that he isn't being realistic, and that maybe Fitz isn't really the best thing for Molly. Chade then states that the real reason he called Fitz was to take care of some Forged ones seen in the area; this was being kept secret from Verity, as he was already overtaxed. Fitz essentially states that Chade would be unable to handle it himself, and Chade rebukes him by mentioning that while Fitz was off at sea, *someone* had been handling things around the keep. 

**Chapter 18**

In the third season against the raiders, Verity wasn't having much success. Out of all of his ships only one was willing to raid the Outislanders. However that ship quickly turned to piracy and abandoned Buckkeep.

Working in the gardens, Kettricken probes Fitz to see what he knows of the Elderlings. In legend, King Wisdom went on a quest to beg for their aid, and the Elderlings gave their support with promises to return in time of need. Patience, tending plants nearby, remarks that King Wisdom actually never returned - the Elderlings pledged to his daughter instead. 

Kettricken tears up when she states that Verity would have no interest in what she has to say - Verity is shocked, having been listening through Fitz, and tells him to bring her to him right away. Kettricken takes the time to dress nicely, making Verity confused until Fitz states that it's *for him.* (to his credit, Verity hastily improves his own appearance before Kettricken arrives.) The three of them discuss Kettricken's idea about a quest into the mountains, with the final verdict being that Verity should be the one to go on the quest. 

Later, Fitz is thinking of Molly, and he realizes that she is truly making sacrifices  for him. She is devoted to him, but she had stopped making any mention if the future and she doesn't believe there is one. Fitz then goes to Patience's room, where was puts him to work hanging herbs. After commenting how Fitz doesn't whine about Molly anymore, she hands him a bouquet of stipple-leaf: falsely rumored to prevent pregnancy, a large quantity of them can make a woman sick, but when gargled can help a sore throat. Patience learned this when she saw Molly collecting them from the garden. Fitz is mortified at how blind he's been, and decides to end things with Molly, not wanting her to make any more sacrifices for him. 

Summoned to the King's room, Fitz meets a very well dressed Verity and Kettricken, learning that Verity is the one who summoned him. Fitz bears witness as the couple ask for Shrewd's permission for Verity to go on the quest for the Elderlings. After an initial denial and a dramatic entrance by Regal (thanks to Wall-Ass being a snitch), Shrewd gives permission for Verity to go. 

Going to Molly's room intending a brief chat, Fitz is instead overcome with passion, leading Molly to remark that he was like a different man that night. Fitz realizes that while he had shielded himself that night, Verity had not. 

**Chapter 19**

Verity departs Buckkeep, bringing with him: Hod, his body servant Charim, Chestnut, Keef, and Kef of his personal guard, and Burrich. Before departing, Verity asks Fitz to both watch over Kettricken and to let Verity stay connected with him as long as possible. 

While Fitz enjoys having both Verity and Burrich away, as he can spend more time with Nighteyes, it is clear that Regal is also enjoying his brother's absence. His followers have a great presence at the keep, and it becomes clear who started spreading word that Verity was off to seek the Elderlings. 

After 23 days of Verity's absence, a rider comes to the keep to tell that Ferry, five days away, has been attacked by Raiders. Despite beacon fires being lit, birds being sent, and the presence of the coterie, word “didn't reach” the Keep until the rider appeared - only to be informed by Regal that there was no money, and it was too late to help them. 

Urged by Verity to go seek some of his hidden jewels to help support Ferry, Fitz finds that someone has gone through Verity's map room. Upon Kettricken’s arrival, they discuss how Regal must have interfered with the messages in order to blacken Verity's name. Fitz later interferes with a situation at the stables, learning that Regal has attempted to sell off several horses, despite not having the authority to do so. 

Summoned to Kettricken’s quarters, she advises him to visit Shrewd that very evening, and that Regal had been making it difficult to truly speak to him. She then goes to tell Fitz of rumors she had heard that would further tarnish Verity's name, and that Regal believes it is in their best interest to treat with the Raiders, rather than fight them. 

**Chapter 20**

We learn that Chade has traveled to the Outislands to try and learn more about Forging. A tyrant, Kebal Rawbread, is to blame for the raids, gathering crews under the threat of Forging their families; or, escralling, as they call it. There is a rumor of a “white ship” that separates souls and a pale woman feared even by Kebal. 

Fitz visits with Shrewd, noting the addictive leaf added to the tea pot. Regal again enters, and he and Fitz have some verbal blows, with Regal attempting to remind Fitz that he is worth nothing. Shrewd remained silent, almost not even hearing them. 

That night, Fitz and Chade discuss the morality of killing, especially deciding to kill on your own rather than it being an order. Frustrated, Fitz mentions that he would like to kill whoever is poisoning the king, and we learn that it is, in fact, Chade supplying the poisons. He alludes that the king knows full well what is happening, but Chade is sworn to secrecy. Ultimately, Chade also admits that finding the Elderlings is their best chance for survival. 

At a dinner with Duke Brawndy, Regal gets drunk and makes an ass of himself, not giving any respect to the seriousness of the situation in Ferry. Fitz is made to sit at “the kids table”, unable to listen to anything being said. Excusing himself, he finds the Fool waiting for him in his room. The Fool asks if Molly is pregnant. Enraged, Fitz goes to strike him, only to see that the Fool has already been severely beaten. Ashamed of himself, Fitz tends to the Fool's wounds. The Fool sensed a shift, an oncoming Farseer heir, and decided asking Fitz about Molly was easier than asking Kettricken if she was pregnant. (he also states that Regal only ‘shares his pleasures with himself’ so the baby can't be his.) Since it's not Molly, Kettricken must be pregnant. The Fool will not say who beat him, only that they placed a bag over his head and threatened him to stop spying for “Verity the pretender”. Whoever beat him also trashed his room. Fitz realizes that despite his smart mouth, the Fool is defenseless. 

Visiting Molly that night, she is frustrated at his lack of visiting. She even took it upon herself to speak with Celerity, and was distraught to find that she liked her. Fitz asks if she's pregnant, but Molly answers that she had been dosing herself to prevent pregnancy. This leads to a big “what if” conversation where Molly would want Fitz to run away with her and the baby, but Fitz would refuse to leave Verity. Molly then tells Fitz that he is just like Burrich, and we get another bombshell: Lady Patience and Burrich were in love, but Burrich had already sworn himself to Chivalry and wouldn't marry Patience. Patience didn't know who Burrich was sworn to until Chivalry sent Burrich to her with a betrothal gift. Fitz, a bit slow in the subtleties of love, pieces together everything that Burrich and Patience had ever said to him that shows their past together. 

**Chapter 21**

Kettricken dines with the distraught Duke Brawndy, who has been waiting days for an audience with the King. She displays her own Queenly methods, subtly honoring Brawndy while he tells his version of the events of Ferry. She admits that much as what he said she had never heard before, and that while she has no power herself, she grieves for his people. Brawndy’s eventual meeting goes sour: it lasts less than an hour, and he immediately begins to pack up for home, as the Farseers offer him no aid.

Kettricken requests he dine with her one last time in the Queen’s quarters before his departure; while at first Fitz thinks it is foolish to make them all stand on the cold, snowy rooftop garden, he quickly understands Kettricken’s brilliance: there, no one is able to eavesdrop, and no one is able to witness Kettricken gifting Brawndy with an extravagant gift of Mountain opals.

Later visiting the King, Fitz unwillingly opens a strong Skill connection between himself, Shrewd, and Verity. Shrewd informs Verity of all the things that Regal and his spy network have “heard” about Brawndy’s betrayals and that they couldn’t trust Kettricken. Verity begs Shrewd to believe in Kettricken, and to not believe everything Regal says. To consult Chade before deciding anything.

Pulled apart, both Fitz and the King are winded and put to bed. The Fool escorts the dizzy Fitz to his bed and then departs to get some elfbark tea from Lacey. While Fitz lays helpless in bed, Selene and Justin enter. Justin attempts to violate Fitz mind and Fitz is unable to resist despite Verity’s pleading - fortunately, best boy Nighteyes is there to defend Fitz instead, attacking Justin from within and causing bodily harm. The Fool returns at that point, finding a choking Justin on the floor with Selene over him. After turning the conversation and loudly proclaiming that Selene tried to force herself on Fitz so that nearby servants overheard, the Fool flounces away. Selene and Justin both depart, and Nighteyes settles in to watch over his weakened packmate.

Let's make donut more deflationary again!,ethtrader,1f06v1t,2024-08-24 10:41:23,11,0.82,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1f06v1t/lets_make_donut_more_deflationary_again/,Sky-876,Meta & Donut,"**Here is my proposal: Burn every Donut tipped in the daily and post section.**

This results in a large number of Donuts being burned. Membership will also play its part.

If we manage to keep Donut deflationary, perhaps there will be greater interest from investors and people who could partner with us.

If I understood correctly, according to u/friendly-airline2426 there was no partnership with Celer Network because we are not deflationary enough with the Donut token. (Please correct me if I misunderstood).

I would also like to invite you bronuts to write an opinion on this suggestion. I know some have written about this in the Daily before. But no post was ever written or a Governance Poll Proposal created.

*Also my question: Do we need a Governance Poll Proposal for my suggestion: Burn every Donut tipped in the daily and post section?*

*One more thing that occurred to me: Sometimes it happens that larger quantities of Donuts are tipped because someone has done something special. How do we get around this dilemma? For example Aminok tips 1,000 Donuts to xxx person for making a special guide... This amount should be a reward and not be burned.*"

Designing an accessible key pouch for an elderly man,Leatherworking,1eeqf1i,2024-07-29 00:11:19,19,0.85,5,https://i.redd.it/e4ac6x0yudfd1.jpeg,tdelbert,,"I’m not great at CAD but I’m awesome at TypeScript and pretty good at math so, using NodeJS to generate an SVG.

Anyway my elderly FIL asked me for a new key pouch. He’s in good health now but he knows he’s getting older and I want this to be accessible to him.

So I’m thinking these features so far:
- secure inside pockets to hold fobs, so he’ll never have to take the fobs out to use the elevator,
- a visible indication of where the fob is, so he knows which side and end of the pouch to use,
- large leather ¾” flaps on either end of the zipper, and another leather flap on the zipper pull,
- keys held in the pouch by multiple straps just under one pouch-length.
- durable enough that he’ll never have to change again, double stitched, unlined.

What other things should I consider for an accessible pouch?"

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 40% of U.S. households are expected to shop on Amazon's Prime Day this week. More than half of Prime Day 2024 shoppers will likely be comparing prices on other retailers but still buying on Amazon. — According to a survey by Numerator
___
**Etsy** is attempting to go back to its roots and reclaim its original mission to support artisans and crafters, while still providing a sales platform for non-handmade goods. The company posted a policy update on Tuesday, noting that in place of its “handmade” and “vintage” labels, it will instead be categorizing products as Made by a seller, Designed by a seller, Sourced by a seller, & Handpicked by a seller. In addition to the product category updates, Etsy launched a new marketing campaign that'll feature Etsy sellers and their products in TV commercials, billboards, and social-media content in the U.S. and U.K. I think this is a brilliant way to humanize the buying experience on the platform — shopping with a real artisan as opposed to shopping with a fictitious private label brand name on Amazon. It's also bringing back its Etsy up virtual seller conference and launching Etsy Design Awards to honor the work of sellers.
___
**Wix** added the ability for merchants to customize their checkout forms, providing a more tailored experience for customers. Merchants can now add custom fields, customize the layout of checkout, adjust field settings, control the visibility of custom fields via conditional rules, and pass on custom field data to emails, thank you pages, and order pages. 
___
More than 200 cryptocurrency domains registered with **Squarespace** have been identified at risk after the company was found to be under a massive DNS hijacking attack. By hijacking DNS functionality, hackers can redirect users to malicious websites or gain unauthorized remote access to an organization’s servers and steal sensitive data. The attack began Thursday with two websites of blockchain projects — Compound and Celer Networks — and then later researchers found that it impacted around 220 others. The incident is being blamed on the recent migration of 10M domains from Google Domains to Squarespace after the acquisition deal last September.
___
Meanwhile across the Canadian border, **Shopify** had nearly 174,000 customers' info leaked on a web hacking forum last week. Shopify denies that its servers were hacked and gave the following statement: “Shopify systems have not experienced a security incident. The data loss reported was caused by a third-party app. The app developer intends to notify affected customers.” Shopify declined to confirm the number of customers impacted or what the particular third-party app is that got hacked. That'd be a nice thing to know for the users of that app, don't you think?
___
Certain Amazon sellers lost their Buy Box status ahead of Prime Day after the company's algorithms found their items being sold for less on Target's website during its Target Circle Week promo, which ended July 13th. The problem for sellers resulted from a change in how Target promoted deals for Circle Week. In the past, Target would show the percentage discount off the regular price, while leaving the listed price the same. However this year, Target showed the item's actual sale price after the discount, which meant it was re-indexed by Amazon's pricing algorithms. Sellers took their concerns to Target, which then adjusted the Circle Week discounts on some listings to say “See price in cart” in order to skirt Amazon's pricing algorithms.
___
**Indiegogo** launched a new e-commerce offering called IndieShop, which allows users to purchase products developed via crowdfunding. The platform is now live on the Indiegogo site, after launching in Beta in May, and currently features 40+ products. Almost a decade ago, Indiegogo launched its InDemand offering, which allows creators to sell their products as pre-orders after crowdfunding is complete and manage customers using the site’s platform. This allows creators to continue driving revenue through the platform after they hit their goal and while the product is in production. The difference between InDemand and Indieshop is that with Indieshop, the products are in-stock and ready-to-ship. Now Indiegogo can take aspiring brands through the entire sales cycle from crowdfunding to pre-orders to selling live once the product is ready.

**Chinese e-commerce vendors** are struggling for survival as sales growth slows and price pressure rises due to shopping platforms competing with aggressive policies to attract customers, as reported by Reuters. Lu Zhenwang, a Shanghai-based e-commerce operator who sells items for small vendors, said, “The good times for e-commerce are over. This year there is fierce competition and I don't think a lot of sellers will survive another three years.” Lu said the operating environment is poor because the rise in e-commerce sales has created what is known in Chinese as the “neijuan” effect — working harder for smaller returns. He told Reuters, “There is no growth in sales, because there are no new customers and the average income of people is not rising like 10 years ago. There is only competition, between platforms, between sellers. This is the new normal for the e-commerce industry in China.”
___
The Reuters article focused on sellers getting squeezed, but it's not any better for **Chinese manufacturers** either right now in the country. Between Temu's aggressive price negotiations with manufacturers, and Shein's allegedly requiring factories to sign loyalty oaths promising they won't sell to competitors — the ones left in the wake of these pricing and exclusivity wars are the manufacturers. Giving the buying power and reach of China's major e-commerce players — like Alibaba, JD.com, Pinduoduo, ByteDance, and Shein — manufacturers are left with a choice: Do I want to make a little bit of money selling my products at rock bottom prices or not sell anything at all? The latter, which could mean shutting down their factories.
___
This year at its upcoming Prime Day sales event, **Amazon** promotions will be pointing shoppers toward collecting packages from its network of lockers and other pick-up points like Whole Foods stores. A spokesperson told Business Insider, “Amazon wants customers to choose the delivery option that is most convenient for them,” and that the company offers “tens of thousands of package pick-up locations” in the U.S. For customers, pick-up points are convenient and oftentimes more secure, especially for those that have previously experienced porch theft. For Amazon, it's less expensive for the company to deliver multiple customer orders to one location, as opposed to making individual drops across the city at each customer's home. Plus, porch piracy costs the company money too.
___
**E-commerce executive shake ups this week....**

**commercetools** appointed Andrew Burton as its new CEO, effective July 8th. Burton succeeds Dirk Hoerig, co-founder and CEO of commercetools, who will remain on the board and transition to the role of Chief Innovation Officer. Burton joins commercetools from Rapid7 where he served as President and COO, growing the company from $150M ARR to over $800M. 

**Bold Commerce** named Steven Guevarra as CFO, succeeding Stuart Henrickson, who left the company, and Brandon Briggs as head of sales and agency partnership, a new position. Bold said in a statement that Guevarra brings “more than two decades of financial experience and expertise scaling high-growth technology companies” and that Briggs, an e-commerce and technology veteran, will assist in the company's effort to build strategic partnerships.

**Global-e Online** promoted Tomer Gold as EVP, Head of the Channels and SMB Division, and Siddharth Jain as EVP, Technology. Gold formerly held the position of VP of Corporate Development at Global-e, while Jain is ascending from his role as Senior VP of Engineering within the company. 

**Elk Home** appointed Anna Lee Schlueter as its new Director of E-commerce, charged with driving advancements in the company's online presence. Schlueter has served as VP and Director of Operations for the past 15 years at Jaben Holdings.

**Guitar Center** appointed Adolfo Rodriguez as VP, Chief Technology & Information Officer, effective July 9th. Rodriguez is responsible for the end-to-end technology vision and execution of the company and will report directly to CEO Gabe Dalporto. He most recently served at Advance Auto Parts, where he spearheaded technological advancements across the company's e-commerce, brick-and-mortar stores, and supply chain. 

**Hasbro** **Inc** named Dan Rawson as global play lead for Dungeons & Dragons and D&D Beyond, its fan platform, where he will be responsible for all D2C and e-commerce operations. Rawson previously led e-commerce and SaaS businesses at Amazon and Microsoft. Hasbro named Stephanie Beal as its new chief supply chain officer. Beal has been with the company since 2022 and recently led a systems transformation to digitize planning processes across the enterprise. Hasbro also appointed Dan Shull as chief digital information officer, a newly created IT strategy position. Shull comes from REI where hew as CTO and previously held executive positions at Signet, Nike, and Borders.
___
**Amazon's AI shopping assistant, Rufus**, is now available to all U.S. customers, just in time for the company's annual Prime Day event this week. Amazon first revealed Rufus in February, but until now, it has only been accessible to a limited number of users in the app. The assistant is trained on Amazon's product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information across the web. And this is just a rumor, but I heard that Rufus is secretly in love with Alexa.
___
**eBay** launched a new dashboard for its eBay Advertising, which the company described as a “reimagined and redesigned advertising experience.” The new version has a revamped Seller Hub Marketing tab and a new Advertising tab that provides sellers with a holistic view of all campaigns so that they can make quick adjustments, as well as a section with recommendations of the day which leverage [ebay.ai](http://ebay.ai) to uncover trends and automatically build campaigns for your listings.
___
**Carvana** introduced a new feature that highlights electric vehicles that qualify for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit within the search results and lets legible customers apply for up to $4,000 in savings from the credit at checkout. Instead of waiting for a lower tax bill next year, customers can now get up to $4,000 savings up front, which automatically flow through to eligible customers' financing terms. 
___
**Ikea U.S.** is trying to better serve the needs of its Spanish-speaking shoppers by launching a Spanish-language platform. In addition to the new online shopping experience, Spanish-speaking customers can also receive support before, during, and after their purchase with a Spanish-speaking associate when calling the support phone line. I'm kind of surprised a company that large didn't already have Spanish-language service for years now. 
___
**Costco** is hiking its annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada by $5, and raising the cost of its higher-tier membership by $10, marking the first increase since 2017. That's an increase to $65 from $60 for regular annual memberships and from $120 to $130 for “Executive Membership.” Rest assured though, the hotdog + coke combo will still sell for $1.50.
___
**Shein logistics software** is in beta testing with select supply chain customers, and cybersecurity firms are concerned over the potential for a company with close ties to China to spy on the supply chain as it grows its global logistics footprint. Dewardric McNeal, senior policy analyst at Longview Global, said, “Given the intricate nature of the U.S. and global supply chains, the potential for espionage or data gathering is a significant risk. Shein’s software could provide unprecedented access to sensitive supply chain data, which the Chinese government could seize under its laws. This exposure poses a direct threat to U.S. supply chain integrity, making it vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation.” Meanwhile Shein's like, “We don't need your secrets. We're already better at this than you.”
___
**Walmart** is offering half off Walmart+ memberships until July 18th, which funny enough, overlaps with Amazon's Prime Day on July 16th and 17th. What are the odds? Walmart+ offers free shipping with no order minimum, free grocery delivery from your local store with a minimum order of $35, savings on fuel, video streaming with Paramount+, free tire repair and road hazard warranty, returns from home, and other perks. Not bad for $49! However note that unlike Amazon Prime memberships, you can't give access to your Walmart+ to other members of your household. They'd all have to login to the same account, which has your payment info tied to it. I learned that the hard way last night when I bought a year of Walmart+, thinking I could add my parents and have them share the membership perks via their own Walmart accounts.
___
More than **3,000 Amazon associates** at Amazon's Coventry warehouse in England voted in a historic trade union recognition ballot that could allow U.K. employees to bargain collectively for rights and pay for the first time. If the collective vote supports recognition, the GMB would be given the right to represent them in negotiations over pay and conditions in what would be the first instance of Amazon recognizing a union in the U.K.
___
**A US judge** ruled against the **FTC** in a challenge to its ruling banning noncompete agreements, citing the FTC's lack of “substantive” rulemaking authority. The preliminary ruling blocks enforcement of the noncompete ban against the plaintiff and other groups that were involved in the case, and signals that the FTC cannot enforce the rule.
___
**OpenAI** **whistleblowers** filed a complaint with the SEC, calling for an investigation into the company for allegedly requiring restrictive NDAs. The whistleblowers claim that OpenAI issued overly restrictive employment, severance, and non-disclosure agreements to its employees, which could lead to penalties against workers who raised concerns about OpenAI to federal authorities.
___
**Marc Andreessen** sent $50k in Bitcoin to an AI bot on X called the Truth Terminal, which operates semi-autonomously, with its human handler only approving its Twitter posts and deciding who it gets to interact with. After a chat with Andreessen where the investor proposed a grant, the bot created a plan of upgrades which included a personal CPU, AI model tweaks, and even a billboard. Andreessen agreed to the plan and proceeded with a $50k one-time grant.
___
**Amazon** introduced App Studio at its AWS Summit last week, a new gen AI-powered platform that allows professionals to build apps using natural language descriptions and prompts. Users can specify the app's function and the data sources it should pull from, and App Studio will produce an app that would have otherwise taken the developer days. In a demo, Amazon demonstrated how App Studio can take a request for an invoice tracking app and lay out suggestions for how it should work, which the developer can approve before creating the actual app.
___
**WhatsApp Business** is reducing rates for utility messages and raising rates for marketing messages, effective Aug 4th and Oct 4th respectively. Over the last year, users have complained about the number of WhatsApp messages increasing over the platform, resulting in spam, so the company started testing restrictions on marketing messages sent to users in India, which it now expanded globally, hoping that the restrictions and increased cost will help reduce the Spam.
___
**Mastercard** and **Nuvei** teamed up to hep consumers in Europe convert digital assets into fiat currency via debit, credit, and prepaid cards. The off-ramping solutions lets consumers convert supported crypto currencies into fiat currency, which they can then transfer to Mastercards without the need to go through third-party exchanges.
___
**Amazon** says it reached its goal of matching all of the electricity consumed by its operations with 100% renewable energy in 2023 — seven years ahead of schedule — — making it the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world for four years running. The company is exploring new carbon-free energy sources in efforts to meet its Climate Pledge commitment of net-zero carbon by 2040. 
___
**The EU** declared that X breached its guidelines under the Digital Services Act, following an investigation into the company's advertising transparency, availability of data, and risk management. X was informed of these preliminary findings on Friday, which found three primary breaches of the DSA including its use of the Blue Check mark to receive verified status, its inability to search its advertising system, and for prohibiting researchers from independently accessing its public data.
___
**TikTok ad spend** is tapering off since March when the U.S. introduced the selloff bill that would require the company to divest the app to American ownership or be banned from the country next year. It's still growing, just slower. Ad spend was up 19% in March, 11% in April, but only 6% in May. Target reduced its spend by 30%, DoorDash by 25%, Bayer by 20%, and Procter & Gamble by 10%.
___
**Amazon Pay India** is introducing new payment methods this year including UPI, credit cards, and wallets, rather than just specializing in a single segment. The company says it sees opportunities in penetrating offline payments and smaller towns, where currently 65% of the transactions done by consumers in tier two and three cities were digital versus 75% in larger cities.
___
Plus 5 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Flip's** acquisition of **Curated**, a marketplace that connects consumers with verified experts for personalized shopping advice, for $330M in stock.

"E-commerce Industry News Recap 🔥 Week of July 15th, 2024",ecommerce,1e45qyu,2024-07-15 16:47:16,9,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1e45qyu/ecommerce_industry_news_recap_week_of_july_15th/,adventurepaul,,"Hi r/ecommerce - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 40% of U.S. households are expected to shop on Amazon's Prime Day this week. More than half of Prime Day 2024 shoppers will likely be comparing prices on other retailers but still buying on Amazon. — According to a survey by Numerator
___
**Etsy** is attempting to go back to its roots and reclaim its original mission to support artisans and crafters, while still providing a sales platform for non-handmade goods. The company posted a policy update on Tuesday, noting that in place of its “handmade” and “vintage” labels, it will instead be categorizing products as Made by a seller, Designed by a seller, Sourced by a seller, & Handpicked by a seller. In addition to the product category updates, Etsy launched a new marketing campaign that'll feature Etsy sellers and their products in TV commercials, billboards, and social-media content in the U.S. and U.K. I think this is a brilliant way to humanize the buying experience on the platform — shopping with a real artisan as opposed to shopping with a fictitious private label brand name on Amazon. It's also bringing back its Etsy up virtual seller conference and launching Etsy Design Awards to honor the work of sellers.
___
**Wix** added the ability for merchants to customize their checkout forms, providing a more tailored experience for customers. Merchants can now add custom fields, customize the layout of checkout, adjust field settings, control the visibility of custom fields via conditional rules, and pass on custom field data to emails, thank you pages, and order pages. 
___
More than 200 cryptocurrency domains registered with **Squarespace** have been identified at risk after the company was found to be under a massive DNS hijacking attack. By hijacking DNS functionality, hackers can redirect users to malicious websites or gain unauthorized remote access to an organization’s servers and steal sensitive data. The attack began Thursday with two websites of blockchain projects — Compound and Celer Networks — and then later researchers found that it impacted around 220 others. The incident is being blamed on the recent migration of 10M domains from Google Domains to Squarespace after the acquisition deal last September.
___
Meanwhile across the Canadian border, **Shopify** had nearly 174,000 customers' info leaked on a web hacking forum last week. Shopify denies that its servers were hacked and gave the following statement: “Shopify systems have not experienced a security incident. The data loss reported was caused by a third-party app. The app developer intends to notify affected customers.” Shopify declined to confirm the number of customers impacted or what the particular third-party app is that got hacked. That'd be a nice thing to know for the users of that app, don't you think?
___
Certain Amazon sellers lost their Buy Box status ahead of Prime Day after the company's algorithms found their items being sold for less on Target's website during its Target Circle Week promo, which ended July 13th. The problem for sellers resulted from a change in how Target promoted deals for Circle Week. In the past, Target would show the percentage discount off the regular price, while leaving the listed price the same. However this year, Target showed the item's actual sale price after the discount, which meant it was re-indexed by Amazon's pricing algorithms. Sellers took their concerns to Target, which then adjusted the Circle Week discounts on some listings to say “See price in cart” in order to skirt Amazon's pricing algorithms.
___
**Indiegogo** launched a new e-commerce offering called IndieShop, which allows users to purchase products developed via crowdfunding. The platform is now live on the Indiegogo site, after launching in Beta in May, and currently features 40+ products. Almost a decade ago, Indiegogo launched its InDemand offering, which allows creators to sell their products as pre-orders after crowdfunding is complete and manage customers using the site’s platform. This allows creators to continue driving revenue through the platform after they hit their goal and while the product is in production. The difference between InDemand and Indieshop is that with Indieshop, the products are in-stock and ready-to-ship. Now Indiegogo can take aspiring brands through the entire sales cycle from crowdfunding to pre-orders to selling live once the product is ready.
___
**Chinese e-commerce vendors** are struggling for survival as sales growth slows and price pressure rises due to shopping platforms competing with aggressive policies to attract customers, as reported by Reuters. Lu Zhenwang, a Shanghai-based e-commerce operator who sells items for small vendors, said, “The good times for e-commerce are over. This year there is fierce competition and I don't think a lot of sellers will survive another three years.” Lu said the operating environment is poor because the rise in e-commerce sales has created what is known in Chinese as the “neijuan” effect — working harder for smaller returns. He told Reuters, “There is no growth in sales, because there are no new customers and the average income of people is not rising like 10 years ago. There is only competition, between platforms, between sellers. This is the new normal for the e-commerce industry in China.”
___
The Reuters article focused on sellers getting squeezed, but it's not any better for **Chinese manufacturers** either right now in the country. Between Temu's aggressive price negotiations with manufacturers, and Shein's allegedly requiring factories to sign loyalty oaths promising they won't sell to competitors — the ones left in the wake of these pricing and exclusivity wars are the manufacturers. Giving the buying power and reach of China's major e-commerce players — like Alibaba, JD.com, Pinduoduo, ByteDance, and Shein — manufacturers are left with a choice: Do I want to make a little bit of money selling my products at rock bottom prices or not sell anything at all? The latter, which could mean shutting down their factories.
___
This year at its upcoming Prime Day sales event, **Amazon** promotions will be pointing shoppers toward collecting packages from its network of lockers and other pick-up points like Whole Foods stores. A spokesperson told Business Insider, “Amazon wants customers to choose the delivery option that is most convenient for them,” and that the company offers “tens of thousands of package pick-up locations” in the U.S. For customers, pick-up points are convenient and oftentimes more secure, especially for those that have previously experienced porch theft. For Amazon, it's less expensive for the company to deliver multiple customer orders to one location, as opposed to making individual drops across the city at each customer's home. Plus, porch piracy costs the company money too.

**Amazon's AI shopping assistant, Rufus**, is now available to all U.S. customers, just in time for the company's annual Prime Day event this week. Amazon first revealed Rufus in February, but until now, it has only been accessible to a limited number of users in the app. The assistant is trained on Amazon's product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information across the web. And this is just a rumor, but I heard that Rufus is secretly in love with Alexa.
___
**eBay** launched a new dashboard for its eBay Advertising, which the company described as a “reimagined and redesigned advertising experience.” The new version has a revamped Seller Hub Marketing tab and a new Advertising tab that provides sellers with a holistic view of all campaigns so that they can make quick adjustments, as well as a section with recommendations of the day which leverage [ebay.ai](http://ebay.ai) to uncover trends and automatically build campaigns for your listings.
___
**Carvana** introduced a new feature that highlights electric vehicles that qualify for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit within the search results and lets legible customers apply for up to $4,000 in savings from the credit at checkout. Instead of waiting for a lower tax bill next year, customers can now get up to $4,000 savings up front, which automatically flow through to eligible customers' financing terms. 
___
**Ikea U.S.** is trying to better serve the needs of its Spanish-speaking shoppers by launching a Spanish-language platform. In addition to the new online shopping experience, Spanish-speaking customers can also receive support before, during, and after their purchase with a Spanish-speaking associate when calling the support phone line. I'm kind of surprised a company that large didn't already have Spanish-language service for years now. 
___
**Costco** is hiking its annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada by $5, and raising the cost of its higher-tier membership by $10, marking the first increase since 2017. That's an increase to $65 from $60 for regular annual memberships and from $120 to $130 for “Executive Membership.” Rest assured though, the hotdog + coke combo will still sell for $1.50.
___

Dewardric McNeal, senior policy analyst at Longview Global, said, “Given the intricate nature of the U.S. and global supply chains, the potential for espionage or data gathering is a significant risk.

If the collective vote supports recognition, the GMB would be given the right to represent them in negotiations over pay and conditions in what would be the first instance of Amazon recognizing a union in the U.K.
___
**A US judge** ruled against the **FTC** in a challenge to its ruling banning noncompete agreements, citing the FTC's lack of “substantive” rulemaking authority. The preliminary ruling blocks enforcement of the noncompete ban against the plaintiff and other groups that were involved in the case, and signals that the FTC cannot enforce the rule.
___
**OpenAI** **whistleblowers** filed a complaint with the SEC, calling for an investigation into the company for allegedly requiring restrictive NDAs. The whistleblowers claim that OpenAI issued overly restrictive employment, severance, and non-disclosure agreements to its employees, which could lead to penalties against workers who raised concerns about OpenAI to federal authorities.
___
**Marc Andreessen** sent $50k in Bitcoin to an AI bot on X called the Truth Terminal, which operates semi-autonomously, with its human handler only approving its Twitter posts and deciding who it gets to interact with. After a chat with Andreessen where the investor proposed a grant, the bot created a plan of upgrades which included a personal CPU, AI model tweaks, and even a billboard. Andreessen agreed to the plan and proceeded with a $50k one-time grant.
___
**Amazon** introduced App Studio at its AWS Summit last week, a new gen AI-powered platform that allows professionals to build apps using natural language descriptions and prompts. Users can specify the app's function and the data sources it should pull from, and App Studio will produce an app that would have otherwise taken the developer days. In a demo, Amazon demonstrated how App Studio can take a request for an invoice tracking app and lay out suggestions for how it should work, which the developer can approve before creating the actual app.

Each week I post a summary recap of the week's top stories, which I cover in depth in the newsletter. Let's dive in...
___

**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon could finally surpass Walmart to become the nation’s biggest company by revenue, having grown by 12% last year compared with Walmart's growth of 6%. Two more years of similar growth discrepancy would push Amazon past Walmart in sales.
___
**Shopify** is suing **Shopline** in New York federal court, accusing it of illegally copying Shopify's software to build its own e-commerce platform. Shopline is a Singapore-based subsidiary of the Chinese technology company JOYY Inc. Shopify said in the lawsuit that Shopline created a “thinly disguised knockoff” of its Dawn theme to power a competing e-commerce service. The lawsuit even says that the “Shopify” name still appears in the code of various versions of Seed that Shopline is distributing, and that Shopify found a Chinese webpage hosted by Joyy with the title “Seed Theme” that still carries headers reading “dawn-test.”
___
In other lawsuit news this week — **Temu** is facing legal action from 17 companies accusing it of violating new EU laws with “manipulative practices” such as making it difficult to delete your account, and lack of transparency over who their sellers are and why certain products are recommended to customers. Temu was the most downloaded app in the UK in 2023 and still remains as a top downloaded app in 2024. 
___
The state of **Arizona** has taken legal action against **Amazon**, launching two lawsuits that accuse the company of monopolistic behavior and deceptive practices involving dark patterns. The first lawsuit claims that Amazon's business practices violate the state's Consumer Fraud Act by employing dark patterns to make it difficult for users to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions. The second lawsuit alleges that Amazon breaches Arizona's Uniform State Antitrust Act by maintaining a monopoly via enforcing agreements with third-party sellers to prevent them from offering lower prices on other platforms. It also challenges Amazon's Buy Box algorithm under the Consumer Fraud Act, claiming that it favors sellers who use Fulfillment By Amazon. The legal actions echo similar complaints from the FTC and various states.
___
Last week **Amazon** made a big splash with its first-ever event during upfront week, taking over Pier 36 in New York which has previously hosted upfront presentations from Disney and TelevisaUnivision. The company called on celebrities including Jake Gyllenhaal, Reese Witherspoon, Will Ferrell, and Alicia Keys to demonstrate how premium their content is. Amazon worked to separate itself from its competitors by showcasing its scale. Prime Video now has an average monthly ad-supported reach of 200M customers, with 115M in the US, making it the largest premium ad-supported streaming service both globally and in the U.S. It also announced new upcoming series such as Spider-Man Noir, Tomb Raider, and a prequel to Legally Blond. 
___
**eBay** launched a new feature called “resell on eBay” that is designed to make it easier for brands and consumers to list clothing for sale on its marketplace. The feature is built into Certilogo, which was acquired by eBay in 2023, which features an AI-powered digital ID printed on the product tag to help brands manage the lifecycle of their garments and give consumers a way to confirm the item's authenticity. Users scan a QR code on a product's smart label to generate a “resell your garment” button. Clicking the button directs the user to check the authenticity of the item through Certilogo's AI authentication system by signing in with their eBay account. From there, an eBay listing is prefilled with information from the brand about the item. Users can then edit the listing, upload additional photos, and publish the item for sale.
___
**Poshmark** launched a new paid marketing tool called “Promoted Closets” that gives sellers the ability to promote their entire shop at once. The tool uses machine learning to automatically promote individual product listings from a seller's entire inventory, identifying shoppers' search terms and matching them with promoted items. Promoted Closet works on a cost per click model where sellers only get charged when a shopper clicks and views the item from a promoted listing. There's an option to set the budget manually or get a recommendation from Poshmark. Each campaign lasts for 7 days.
___
**Klarna** says that it is not sharing its customer data with credit bureaus in the US because the bureaus “do not have proper models to responsibly process the data and ensure good consumer outcomes.” It does share its data with UK credit bureaus. Klarna added that the credit models used today in the US “were built decades ago and calculate data based on monthly payments, long-term loans, and open lines of credit. But BNPL does not fit into these categories.” The company claims that BNPL is different because it offers bi-weekly instead of monthly payments, and unlike a credit card, Klarna doesn't offer an open line of credit.
___
**Third party sellers on Amazon**, which make up 60% of sales on Amazon's marketplace, are reconsidering how heavily they'll discount products this year for Prime Day, given how much seller fees have increased on the platform in recent months, according to Modern Retail. According to data from SmartScout, Amazon FBA fees for standard-sized products have jumped 96% over the past 10 years, outpacing inflation. Seller fees can eat up about half the cost per sale on Amazon, according to Marketplace Pulse. That doesn't leave much room for running Prime Day deals, which primarily benefit Amazon as opposed to the individual merchants who are pressured to wipe out their little remaining margin for the sake of running a deal at all.
___
**Netflix** announced durings it Upfronts presentation that it's launching its own advertising platform to compete against Google, Amazon, Hulu, Comcast, and other ad giants. Amazon has only been in the advertising business for a year and a half after launching its ad-supported tier in Nov 2022. Netflix originally partnered with Microsoft to develop its ad tech, which let the streaming platform enter the ad space quickly and catch up with rivals like Hulu, which has offered an ad-supported tier since 2010. Launching its own in-house ad tech will allow Netflix to take full control of its advertising and create targeted and personalized ad experiences. Netflix wants to experiment with “episodic” campaigns, which involves a series of ads that tell a story rather than delivering repetitive ads. Brilliant!
___
**Slack** is under attack after users discovered that the company has been using their messages, content, and files to train its global AI models, which Slack uses to power their channel and emoji recommendations and search results. It was discovered that if you don't want Slack to use your data, you have to e-mail the company to opt-out, which isn't a good look for a company that makes a big deal out of telling customers that “You control your data.” In response to the outrage, Slack published a blog post to clarify how its customers' data is used.
___
**Google** will now let you perform a “web” search, which lets you filter out almost all of its AI results and knowledge panels that currently take over its SERPs, leaving you with just links and text like the old days. The order of the search results are the same regardless of whether you pick “web” or “all”, and it doesn't block links to YouTube videos or Reddit posts. There are also still ads that appear above and below the results. 
___
**YouTube** is officially launching its YouTube Select “creator takeovers,” which lets advertisers buy out the ad inventory on channels representing the top 1% of content on the platform. The program began as a pilot at the end of 2023 and is now opening to more top creators.
___
**Wix** launched three new AI-powered image enhancement and creation tools to help users create and display high-quality images. The new tools include an AI Image Creator to make the images, Object Eraser to remove unwanted objects in the images, and AI Image Editor to add/edit portions of the image. Honestly, the three tools kind of sound like one tool with three features, but you do you, Wix. 

___

**Temu**, which is already 20% bigger than Shein in the US and gets 42% of its business from the US, Mexico, and Chile, is turning its attention to Europe and wants to grow rapidly in the region. The company has redirected its enormous ad spend to Europe and Mexico while Washington scrutinizes its business practices in the US. 

___

**Visa** announced major changes to how its credit and debit cards will operate in the US in the coming months and years. The new features mean consumers will be carrying fewer physical cards in their wallets, and will make the 16-digit card number increasingly irrelevant. The biggest change will be the ability for banks to issue one physical card that is connected to multiple bank accounts, which consumers can apply usage rules to.
___


**Mastercard** and **Salesforce** announced a new integration designed to help customers speed up the resolution of transaction disputes and chargebacks, as well as reduce costs associated with resolving them. The partnership will integrate Salesforce's Financial Services Cloud with Mastercard's dispute resolution services, providing real time notifications and a central dashboard for managing disputes.

___

**Meta** is taking inspiration from BeReal and Snapchat by developing a feature for Instagram called “Peek” that allows users to post authentic pictures that can only be viewed once. A photo shared via a Peek would have to be taken with your camera in the moment, as you would not be able to upload an image from your gallery, and you won't be able to add filters or edit the photo. 

___

**Ikea** launched a TikTok livestream where cats and dogs model and demonstrate new Ikea products for pets. The Pet Shopping Network will appear for everyone in the UK on TikTok and showcase pets demonstrating Ikea's 29-piece pet furniture range. 


___
**Sam's Club** is planning to launch an online shopping portal in Hong Kong within the next two months, giving the territory access to its products via e-commerce. The service will include free delivery for purchases over 599 yuan ($83).

___

**Amazon** raised warehouse worker wages to $15/hour five years ago, but today half of workers surveyed told researchers they struggle to afford food and rent. Amazon called the researcher's methodology “deeply flawed” and said the company had tried to raise its concerns with the study’s authors but never heard back.

___

**Lots of layoffs this week…** Amazon laid off more than 100 customer service reps, Walmart let go of hundreds of corporate staffers and ordering employees across the US and Canada, Gopuff laid off 6% of its staff, and Indeed laid off 8% of its workforce.

___

Remember that former **diversity program manager at Facebook** who stole more than $4M from the company through fake business deals in exchange for kickbacks? I first reported on Barbara Furlow-Smiles in December of last year when she pled guilty to the theft. Well, last week she was sentenced to five years and three months in prison for her scheme. 

___

In the world of corporate turnover… The **chief of Amazon Web Services**, Adam Selipsky, is stepping down next month after a three-year term to be replaced by Matt Garman, a senior VP who has overseen sales and marketing at AWS. Also, **eBay's VP of Global Communications**, Michelle Friedman, departed the company to take on a role at Samsara, a cloud platform built for tracking and analyzing data from physical operations. 

___

**Meta** is shutting down **Workspace**, a version of Facebook that had been built to enable communication among business teams and organizations. Sources say that it will be business as usual on the platform until August 25, 2025, and then it will be read-only until May 2026. Meta is recommending Zoom-owned Workvivo as a migration-ready alternative. 

___

**Ted Baker Canada** is holding store-closing clearance sales across locations in the US and Canada after filing for bankruptcy in April. As of May 10th, online shopping is no longer available and all sales are final across the company's brick-and-mortar retail locations.
___


**Sezzle**, a US-based BNPL service, partnered up with **Celerant Technology**, a POS system for retailers, to offer a BNPL option when checking out in-store . The two companies had partnered in 2023 to offer BNPL options online, and now the solution is being brought to brick-and-mortar stores.

___

**BuyBay**, a Dutch recommerce platform, is launching a SaaS product using its own recommerce software. Retailers and manufacturers can now resell unreturned products from their own distribution center, which helps reduce CO2-emissions and increase profits.

___

**Setapp Mobile**, a subscription-based alternative to the Apple App Store that's now possible thanks to the EU's Digital Markets Act, went into invite-only beta last week. The new app store allows customers to play with a range of apps without being hit with reduced features, ads, options to upgrade, and without spending money on something they may not use. The biggest challenge with the Setapp iOS store is getting the app installed on your iPhone, which involves following a link, installing software, and then activating it — a process made intentionally cumbersome by Apple.

___

**Avalara** expanded its partnership with Shopify by joining the Shopify Tax Platform. Avalara has powered tax calculation for Shopify Plus customers since 2015, and now through the Shopify Tax Partner Platform, the company can serve all Shopify customers with their global tax compliance tools.

___

**Walmart** delivered 4.4B items the same day or next day, beating Amazon, which said it did 4B items in one day. Walmart's advantage is that it uses stores for its same-day deliveries.
___
Plus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Gorgias's** $29M Series C-2 round, which it plans to use the funds from to launch its new AI Agent. 
___

**Setapp Mobile**, a subscription-based alternative to the Apple App Store that's now possible thanks to the EU's Digital Markets Act, went into invite-only beta last week. The new app store allows customers to play with a range of apps without being hit with reduced features, ads, options to upgrade, and without spending money on something they may not use. The biggest challenge with the Setapp iOS store is getting the app installed on your iPhone, which involves following a link, installing software, and then activating it — a process made intentionally cumbersome by Apple.

___

**Avalara** expanded its partnership with Shopify by joining the Shopify Tax Platform. Avalara has powered tax calculation for Shopify Plus customers since 2015, and now through the Shopify Tax Partner Platform, the company can serve all Shopify customers with their global tax compliance tools.

___

**Walmart** delivered 4.4B items the same day or next day, beating Amazon, which said it did 4B items in one day. Walmart's advantage is that it uses stores for its same-day deliveries.
___
Plus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Gorgias's** $29M Series C-2 round, which it plans to use the funds from to launch its new AI Agent. 
___
I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

This instalment will outline the other top projects that are using Oasis in ways that are an inspiration for other projects.

1. **DeltaDAO** - This is one of the most unique project partnering with Oasis. Having checked the scope and impact of Oasis Sapphire, DeltaDAO felt the need of building an exclusive paratime (parallel runtime) on Oasis that aligned best with their goal of unlocking the power of data & AI with AI & Data Spaces as a Service. Winner of the [Oasis grant, DeltaDAO](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oasis-awards-new-grant-deltadao) have developed the [Pontus-X ecosystem](https://oasisprotocol.org/decentralized-ai#partners) leveraging the modular architecture of Oasis for privacy-enabled AI data management. 
2. **SmartWhales** - Every DeFi enthusiasts know how rewarding copy trading can be. But can onchain trading like this be secure? Another [Oasis grant winner, SmartWhales](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/smartwhales-grant-confidential-onchain-trading) has brought confidentiality solutions to the business of copy trading amidst the complex world of financial privacy in web3. This is an example of the Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL) in action where sensitive user data stays protected while the platform for onchain trading and investing reach out to new and veteran users.
3. **Polychain Monsters** - [Oasis grant recipient Polychain Monsters](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/january-2024-grant-confidential-gaming) are taking the web3 gaming scene by storm by introducing confidentiality and roivacy to the mix. A cross-chain gaming experience that caters to users in the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon and Solana ecosystems, the integration of Oasis brand of smart privacy means the landscape of confidential web3 gaming is changing for the better and safer UX.
4. **Rehide** - This is a triumph of interoperability between diverse privacy-preserving techniques. As a result, Rehide’s zero-knowledge password management will use Oasis Sapphire's trusted execution environment and end-to-end encryption to set new standards in web3 login security. [Rehide is yet another Oasis grant recipient](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/rehide-grant-security-web3-data-passwords-management) and will allows users to secure their data using their web3 wallet, storing it on-chain through “Rehide Confidential Note” smart contracts & IPFS, and accessing it via NFTs.
5. **Synternet** - This project is in the business of powering modular, interoperable data infrastructure for dApps and it is no wonder Oasis Saphhire with its confidential EVM and smart privacy solutions would trigger the beginning of a long-standing partnership. Notably, this is more in line with the needs of developers and dApp builders as they can deploy dApps with stringent confidentiality, enabling new use-cases in finance, healthcare, etc.

Which of these projects do you think is the most intriguing and can potentially transform the way we interact with and experience web3? Discuss in the comments."

Jeśli szukasz miejsca, gdzie możesz zakupić Celer Network (CELR), istnieje kilka opcji, które warto rozważyć. Celer Network to projekt zorientowany na skalowalność blockchain, który ma na celu umożliwienie szybkich i tanich mikropłatności oraz skalowalnych dAppów. Gdzie więc możesz kupić CELR?

1. **Giełdy kryptowalutowe**: Jednym z najpopularniejszych miejsc do zakupu CELR są giełdy kryptowalutowe. Platformy takie jak Binance, Huobi, czy OKEx zazwyczaj oferują duży wolumen handlu CELR w parze z innymi kryptowalutami lub fiatami. Możesz tam zakupić CELR za pomocą Bitcoin, Ethereum lub innych popularnych kryptowalut.

2. **Debiutujące giełdy**: Niektóre nowo powstałe giełdy kryptowalutowe mogą również oferować możliwość zakupu CELR. Zawsze warto sprawdzić, czy nowe platformy są godne zaufania i czy posiadają odpowiednie zabezpieczenia.

3. **Platformy DeFi**: Celer Network to projekt DeFi, więc niektóre decentralizowane giełdy (DEXy) mogą również oferować możliwość zakupu CELR. Uniswap, SushiSwap czy PancakeSwap to przykłady DEXów, na których możesz szukać CELR.

4. **Brokerzy kryptowalutowi**: Inną opcją są brokerzy kryptowalutowi, którzy mogą oferować prostsze interfejsy do zakupu CELR za pomocą tradycyjnych metod płatności, takich jak karta kredytowa czy przelew bankowy.

Pamiętaj, że niezależnie od wybranej platformy do zakupu CELR, zawsze warto upewnić się, że masz odpowiednie zabezpieczenia swojego portfela oraz że korzystasz z wiarygodnej i bezpiecznej usługi.

5 more Oasis Ecosystem Projects Redefining Web3 UX With Smart Privacy Integration - Part 2,dapps,1bvh4k1,2024-04-04 03:26:12,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dapps/comments/1bvh4k1/5_more_oasis_ecosystem_projects_redefining_web3/,DC600A,,"Last time we discussed [top 5 Oasis Network ecosystem projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/dapps/comments/1b8o0dq/top_5_oasis_ecosystem_projects_redefining_web3_ux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which are redefining the web3 UX by integrating smart privacy solutions. While Enshrine Computing, Celer Network's IM and cBridge, Ocean Protocol's Predictoor, illumineX, and PixelRealm cover a wide range of innovative and privacy-enabled use cases, Oasis has more projects that deserve our attention. Let's take a look at these week's 5 projects in highlight.

1. **ProtoFire** \- Gnosis Safe built by ProtoFire has long been a premier choice for storing and managing digital assets on EVM chains. Now, Oasis Safe has been deployed as a fork of Gnosis Safe on Oasis Sapphire. As a result, users can now enjoy the benefits of smart privacy through confidentiality, end-to-end encryption, confidential randomness, EVM compatibility, scalability, and low-cost fees. So, next time you think of a programmable and secure wallet to store your assets, think of Oasis Safe, brought to you by the [collaboration between Oasis and ProtoFire](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/protofire-gnosis-safe-sapphire).
2. **Crust Network** \- Ever since Oasis has concentrated on bringing the benefits of smart privacy to the world of web3, several projects have aligned themselves and also won grants in the process. One of the earliest such projects is Crust Network. The grant has helped them to make [web3 data storage privacy-enabled through encryption](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/crust-network-grant). As a direct result of this partnership, we have seen the emergence of [Crust Files](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/crust-files-integration-announcement) as the destination for safer key management and storing of personal information in a setting that ensures decentralized storage, secure uploading, and easy sharing.
3. **CoinSender** \- Another Oasis grant recipient, [CoinSender](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/coinsender-grant-announcement) is a leading solution provider of crypto payment across multiple chains. The platform's suite of payment tools needed privacy features and functionalities leveraged through Oasis Saphhire. Since then, CoinSender has [publicly launched](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/coinsender-public-launch-announcement) its specialized token distribution and management platform. As a SaaS product, it is ideal for simplifying web3 payments for diverse use cases, from crypto payroll and airdrops to staking and pooling payouts. 
4. **Oraichain** \- This is a triumph of interoperability across ecosystems with the help of Oasis Sapphire's cross-chain tool - OPL or the Oasis Privacy Layer. It has led to [Oraichain](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oraichain-integration-privacy-on-cosmos) of Cosmos ecosystem, an IBC-enabled L1 protocol to leverage OPL for optimizing its AI-infused dApps and oracle services. As an example of this integration, OraiDEX can now offer its users the best of both worlds - CosmWasm-based decentralized exchange and smart privacy solutions of confidential EVM.
5. **Synthr** \- In the world of DeFi, there is a huge demand for synthetic omnichain assets. Synthr envisions a web3 future of capital-efficient, slippage-free omnichain liquidity for every user, investor, and trader. Aligning itself with Oasis smart privacy solutions is a step towards that goal.  The collaboration will also see the [launch of syRose](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/syrose-launch-synthr-partnership) \- the synthetic variant of the Oasis native token. The synthetic token would be available in Oasis Sapphire-powered confidential multichain DEX, illumineX and offer users the chance to make the most of lending, swapping, and staking functions.

Which of these projects do you think is the most intriguing and can potentially transform the way we interact with and experience web3? Discuss in the comments, and stay tuned for the next installment where I bring you 5 more projects in the Oasis ecosystem that are redefining web3 interactions and experiences of users through privacy integration."

In light of the new [Celer bridge between Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjtzog/tutorial_bridging_moon_to_arbitrum_one_via_celer/), we have been updating the technology supporting Moons to account for the wider ecosystem. Starting on Friday, [the flair bot was updated to include Moons on Arbitrum One](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bkcv4p/moonsmodbot_has_been_updated_to_include_moons/). Today, our governance platform [Snapshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bkcv4p/moonsmodbot_has_been_updated_to_include_moons/) has been updated to include your Moons on Arbitrum One in your voting weight. We have tested this in [a poll here](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth/proposal/0x56fe872b353ed8b035268f0a40b5cf91bc1c59451cfd7359c94e77fae2af4190) and you can feel free to try it out for yourself over the next 24 hours.

This update means that for any address you sign a vote with, your cumulative balance of Moons on both Nova and One will be considered your vote weight. You will not need to specify which network to vote with or vote twice. You can see in our example vote that this address with [580k Moons on One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xfa8243b329c24a06db98169a3ff16aa77b257391#tokentxns) and [604k on Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xfa8243b329c24A06dB98169a3fF16Aa77b257391#tokentxns) voted with the cumulative weight of 1.2M Moons.

However, if you have your moons in multiple addresses (whether that is on Arb One, Nova, or both) you would need to sign your votes with each of those addresses.

**Discover the Scent of Your Favourite Games**

Lately, GameScent has introduced a device capable of emitting an array of scents, including gunfire, explosions, racing tracks, storms, forests, and an air neutralizer to refresh the surroundings. However, initial feedback raises some concerns. In a review featured in the Gaming Bible, Ewan Moore described the forest scent as overpowering, likening the experience to being sprayed with perfume in a department store. This proximity caused discomfort, leaving a lingering taste and mild headache. While the success of this technology remains uncertain, GameScent intends to expand its offerings with additional scents in the near future, such as ocean, fresh-cut grass, zombie, blood, big city, and more.

**Top NFT Sales This Week**

A notable transaction in the digital art and collectibles space saw a rare Meridian sell for 12.5 ETH, approximately three times the floor price of 4.5 ETH. The event depicts a potential shift in investor interest towards art-focused NFTs, particularly following the significant sale of CryptoPunk for around $16.3 million. Other big sales this week included Thick Liquidity #18 NFT minted on the Fantom network for around $538,207 and Bitcoin Ordinal sold for almost $500k.

Everything to know (so far) about Moons on Arbitrum One.,CryptoCurrency,1bl4uwy,2024-03-22 13:27:36,46,0.75,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bl4uwy/everything_to_know_so_far_about_moons_on_arbitrum/,GabeSter,:moons: MOONS,"**The Bridge is open and Moons are on Arbitrum One. Here's everything you need to know about Moons on Arbitrum One.**

\_\_\_

**Number 1:** Moons are not Migrating you don't need to do anything with your Moons on Nova. This simply opens the door to be able to use Moons on both Nova and One.

\_\_\_

**Number 2:** There are two ways to Bridge Moons between Nova and One.

* Option 1 is the [Official Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=ethereum&sourceChain=arbitrum-nova) \- this method takes seven days and requires multiple transaction on mainnet ETH so it requires lots of gas, and shouldn't be used unless you're bridging large amounts of Moons between Nova and One.

https://preview.redd.it/g4wkobw07xpc1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=06408e492a73b9e20e4b4f1b3ecf420ff99f71ae

* Option 2 is the [Celer Bridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/42170/42161/MOON), this Bridge goes directly between Nova and One using User Provided Liquidity Pools on both sides. This allows users to earn Liquidity Fees with 0 impermanent loss. I have a write up on how the pools works [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjxom1/celer_bridge_incentive_overview_and_liquidity/).

\_\_\_

**Number 3:** How to add Arbitrum One and Moons to your Hot Wallet.

Unlike Nova, Arbitrum One is an incredibly easy network to add to your Hot Wallet. (below are the steps for MetaMask)

https://preview.redd.it/zrvcb1967xpc1.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d2ef3ebdcd242757c9a20eb7c31f9b97c2ef7b

Press the ""Network"" button -> Press ""Add network"" -> Press ""Add"" next to Arbitrum One -> Press ""Approve""

Once Arbitrum One is added you'll need to add Moons as a token

https://preview.redd.it/8oh69zp47xpc1.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=4db76236514d2796e42c9ca54de20383c79026ed

While on the Arbitrum One Network - Select the ""Tokens"" Tab -> Press ""Import tokens"" -> Enter the following Token Contract Address **0x24404DC041d74cd03cFE28855F555559390C931b** \-> Press ""Next"" -> Press ""Import"".

You can now see Moons as an Asset in your hot wallet on Arbitrum One.

\_\_\_

**Number 4:** How to buy and sell Moons on Arbitrum One.

Liquidity for Moons is currently being added to Camelot. [This link](https://app.camelot.exchange/) takes you to the trading page on Camelot to buy and sell Moons on Arbitrum One.

Currently there is $252K in Moon/Eth liquidity on Camelot.

\_\_\_

**Number 5:** Why Camelot?

The answer is Arbitrum Rewards for liquidity providers. Although these are not live for Moons yet - Camelot has a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to subsidize liquidity providers on Camelot with ARB tokens. So growing TVL and Volume on Camelot will allow Moon Liquidity Providers to start seeing extra rewards in the form of ARB.

Once Camelot offers ARB rewards - I will look at making a guide on how to add liquidity to Camelot, if you want to add liquidity before then you can do so using [this link](https://app.camelot.exchange/pools/0x5e27A422ec06A57567a843FD65A1BBB06aC19FC0)."

The gas in Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One is paid in ETH,  the gas is minuscule though so you do not need a lot. 

With bridging to the Ethereum network being expensive with ETH gas it is cheaper to buy ETH on Kraken and send it to your Arbitrum Nova ETH address. I believe you can also do this with other tools like Camelot or swaps, but I am not familiar with them. "
Celer Bridge Incentive Overview and Liquidity Guide.,CryptoCurrency,1bjxom1,2024-03-21 00:02:27,53,0.89,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjxom1/celer_bridge_incentive_overview_and_liquidity/,GabeSter,:moons: MOONS,"**The Celer Bridge is live and you likely want to know:**

* **Are the incentives to provide bridge liquidity for Moons worth it?**
* **If so how do you provide liquidity?**

This post aims to answer both of these questions.

\---------------------

# Are the incentives to provide bridge liquidity for Moons worth it?

In order to answer this question we first need to understand how the Moon Nova/One bridge works. Importantly this bridge works by users Pooling Moons on both Nova and One, which then allows others users to Transfer Moons to a Pool on one side and then receive Moons from a pool on the other side of the bridge.

*I.E. A user transferring ten Moons from Nova to One would send ten Moons to the Pool on Nova and receive ten moons minus fees from the pool on One.*

**Because the only thing being moved back and forth is Moons and you will always receive more Moons (fees) after someone uses your Pooled Moons to bridge. This allows users to farm Moon rewards with zero impermanent loss.**

\-----

In this way - on paper, it is theoretically worth it for anyone to provide Bridge Liquidity as they earn extra Moons when their Moons are used by someone else to bridge to/from nova and one.

However there are a few more considerations to make.

1. Do we know what APY looks like?
2. What are the 3rd party risks?

To Answer Question 1:

* APY of the bridge is based on supply/demand of the bridge until more time has passed we don't know what average supply/demand will look like.
   * I.E. If no one Bridges, Bridge Providers don't make fees and if lots of bridging occurs providers make a lot in fees.
* To incentivize individuals to provide Bridge Liquidity Celer announced they'll be paying out 285K Celer tokens over the first 60 days that the bridge is live. (APY for this reward will be subject to total Bridge Supply on both Nova and One.) 

To Answer Question 2:

* Whenever you place Moons in the custody of a 3rd party you open yourself to a 3rd party risk. It doesn't matter if that's with a CEX like Kraken, a DEX like Camelot/Sushi, or a Bridging Service like Celer. If something happens like a hack/exploit, you could lose your Moons that are in the custody of the third party.

Given the fact that rewards come with Zero Impermanent Loss you have to decide if the third party risk makes sense for you to farm Celer Bridge Rewards, and if it does the amount of Moons you want to provide Bridge Liquidity with.

\---------------------

# How do you provide liquidity?

Providing Liquidity on Celer is incredibly Simple. First go to the Liquidity Page for the Celer Bridge.

[https://cbridge.celer.network/liquidity](https://cbridge.celer.network/liquidity)

https://preview.redd.it/10pvyt8l2mpc1.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f537402a478e1771479c9d4085bdd1b1aefecd0

Once there connect your wallet that you will be providing Bridge liquidity with - once you've connected your wallet you can search Moon to find the Moon Pool or alternatively scroll through the pools until you see the Moon pool.

https://preview.redd.it/uwge3o446ppc1.png?width=1765&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7cc91242cf35a39d5f6ef17704129fef01914e0

Once you've found it expand the section and press the plus sign to add liquidity for Moons on Arbitrum Nova or Arbitrum One. **Importantly you do not need to provide Bridge Liquidity on both sides.**

https://preview.redd.it/yj5fyplu5ppc1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab633a4d7da721752af906df73bb5a2823d825b3

*For this example I will be providing Liquidity on Nova. (but it's the same idea for One)*

Press the add Liquidity button *(it will prompt you to switch to Arbitrum Nova if you are not already there, switch to Arbitrum Nova find the Moon Pool and press Add Liquidity again)* and the following page will load.

https://preview.redd.it/xel3p1lo2mpc1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=788c726363b49bf0ffb7c4a6c923a9f3e72d6615

**Important note: You must provide more than 35 Moons in Bridge Liquidity (35.1 works, 35 does not)**

Approve the Moons in your wallet,

https://preview.redd.it/zbw3dmjp2mpc1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e36b709a20a83a0e1c104bce312d6f91feea53d

**Important note 2: It is always recommended to ONLY APPROVE the total amount of Moons you'll be adding and never press Max.**

Once you approve the transaction the previous page will load for a few second and then show an Add Liquidity button.

https://preview.redd.it/7ndan1tq2mpc1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e83aaeb272582bf1d930f7bf6a21153f6a8c65

Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait!

Once the Transaction goes through you can then go back to the Moon Pool on Celer and you will now see your share of the liquidity on the display.

https://preview.redd.it/d58949qh6ppc1.png?width=1441&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee6227546caf9eb895797000104f1a9b89eded74

As people bridge to/from Nova and One your liquidity will move between the two pools. You can remove liquidity at any time from either pool by pressing the negative button, and following the prompts to remove your liquidity from that pool."
Tutorial: Bridging MOON to Arbitrum One via Celer (Celer Bridge is now live!),CryptoCurrency,1bjtzog,2024-03-20 21:00:56,72,0.71,293,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjtzog/tutorial_bridging_moon_to_arbitrum_one_via_celer/,CryptoMods,:moons: MOONS,"We are very thankful to Celer for supporting MOON in this move to bridge to Arbitrum one. Here is a brief summary of Celer and how they are working to build critical infrastructure to support communities like our own:

Celer is a blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, privacy solutions and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Messaging SDK to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. Users of Celer-enabled dApps will enjoy the benefits of a diverse multi-blockchain ecosystem with the simplicity of a single-transaction UX, all from a single chain.

# Step 1 - Recover your Vault & Acquire ETH

You will need ETH on Arbitrum one and Arbitrum nova in order to initiate the bridge in either direction and to use MOON after completing the bridge. You can fund your wallet with ETH on both networks via [kraken,](https://www.kraken.com/) crypto.com, gate.io, [orbiter,](https://www.orbiter.finance/) or [arbitrum’s official bridge.](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) Kraken put together a [great guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/s/CzVb1kxPWo) for users detailing how to recover your vault, connect to Arbitrum nova and fund your wallet with ETH.

# Step 2 - Bridge via Celer

Go to [Celer](https://cbridge.celer.network/42170/42161/MOON) and connect your wallet via metamask. Make sure you have Arbitrum nova selected as the source chain and Arbitrum one as the destination chain, and MOON as the selected token. Then input the number of MOON you wish to bridge, click the blue bridge button at the bottom, and confirm the prompted transaction in your metamask.

# Step 3 - Add MOON to Metamask on Arbitrum One

At the bottom of the home page on your metamask wallet you should see “Don’t see your token? Import tokens” with import tokens as a hyperlink. Click that hyperlink, and under contract address paste the following: [0x24404DC041d74cd03cFE28855F555559390C931b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b) Then click import and your MOON balance will propagate.

**12.** Moons have **intangible value!**

Back in 17th century Europeans traded with New England Natives, the natives didn't use silver or gold, they used durable skeleton parts of animals they hunted down. It was mostly sea-shell money - wampum. Wampump then spread far away from clam's habitat into other tribes. They also made artful blades and necklessess. Blades that weren't made for cutting but for sheer enjoyment. Collecting and decorating things originates all back to Africa. People like doing things for fun, it's irrational and not practical but we do it. We trade with it or pass it to our children. Like some animals, humans learned that non-kin altruism grew community stronger. 

We put our feelings, thoughts and knowledge into our contributions and grow, protect and guide our community. As we did **after sunset**. We as a community create then capture that value!

Earning Moons is proof of our contributions to the community and reputation that can be carried across the web once other apps start displaying social tokens!

**13.** There are plans of **expanding Moons to other platforms in the next 12 months**!

**14.** Moons have **small mcap** and small circulating supply in comparison to many other tokens!

* If **Moons** had  **Bonk**'s market cap of **$1.6B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$20.51**, an upside of **58x**  
* If  **Moons** had **dogwifhat**'s market cap of **$2.2B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$26.78**, an upside of **76x**
* If **Moons** had  **Shiba Inu**'s market cap of **$14.5B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$180.61**, an upside of **518x**
* If  **Moons** had  **Dogecoin**'s market cap of **$20.3B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$252.39**, an upside of **725x** 
* If  **Moons** had  **Dogecoin**'s ATH market cap of **$88B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$1060**

**15.** Moons have **yet to be listed** on several big exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin

To clarify this is **not a migration**, but rather a **two-way bridge**. If you wish to keep your Moons on Arbitrum nova that is perfectly fine, and as of now exchanges only support deposits on Arbitrum nova.

As a warning this is somewhat technically intensive for the uninitiated and requires ETH on Arbitrum nova, mainnet, and Arbitrum one to complete. **Two mainnet transactions are required**, one to claim Moons on mainnet and another to bridge Moons from mainnet to Arbitrum one.  

\*\*\*

**Instructions:**

1. Go to bridge.arbitrum.io (double check the URL on your screen matches)

2. Select Nova to Ethereum 

3. Select token, enter Moons contract on Arbitrum nova: 0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0

4. Approve and bridge

7 days later

5. Claim the Moons on Ethereum 

6. Select networks, Ethereum to ONE

7. Select token and Enter Ethereum Moons contract, (https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2490e357980ce57bf5745e181e537a64eb367b1) approve and bridge

8. Wait few minutes and claim the Moons on ONE

\*\*\*

Unfortunately **this bridge takes 7 days to complete**, and given mainnet **gas fees** have to be paid twice it likely will not make sense for small dollar amounts of Moons to be transferred through the official bridge.

Thankfully **on March 20th Celer protocol** will be supporting moons via a pools model to allow for users to **bridge moons directly between Arbitrum nova and Arbitrum one** without having to wait a week. Celer is also providing incentives for bridge LPs: 285,000 Celer tokens will be distributed over the first 60 days the bridge is live.

### Primer

[Polygon Labs](https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is a software company that develops zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solutions for Ethereum, including [Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network](https://polygon.technology/polygon-pos), [Polygon zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm), and [Polygon Miden](https://polygon.technology/polygon-miden). The [Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK)](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-chain-development-kit-launch-zk-l2s-on-demand-to-unlock-unified-liquidity) is a collection of open-source software components that makes it easy for developers to design and launch ZK-powered L2s on Ethereum.

In June 2023, Polygon Labs unveiled [Polygon 2.0](https://polygon.technology/roadmap), a series of proposed upgrades to the Polygon ecosystem. The core vision of Polygon 2.0 is to enable unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through the integration of ZK technology, enabling an aggregated network that looks and feels like the internet. As a part of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, the Polygon PoS network will be upgraded to a [zkEVM Validium network](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187) that shares security with Ethereum. Polygon 2.0 will also bring significant updates to [protocol architecture](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-protocol-vision-and-architecture), [tokenomics](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-tokenomics), and [governance](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-governance).

In January 2024, Polygon Labs released information about the [Aggregation Layer](https://polygon.technology/blog/aggregated-blockchains-a-new-thesis) (AggLayer) which creates an aggregated blockchain network that unifies liquidity across the Polygon ecosystem and allows developers to connect any EVM L1 or ZK L2, which can easily be spun up using Polygon CDK. The AggLayer, in conjunction with Polygon CDK, has been described as the future for Polygon.

### Key Metrics

https://preview.redd.it/17miefpuhanc1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=df1018130d2f1dc65d7ad046ba43f214b16cdaa6

### Introduction

[Polygon 2.0](https://polygon.technology/roadmap) represents a significant shift in the evolution of Polygon protocols. This set of enhancements covers multiple areas including protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance.

The core [vision](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-2-0-the-value-layer-of-the-internet) of Polygon 2.0 is to build an aggregated blockchain network that enables unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through the integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. This upgrade aims to address the inherent scaling challenges faced by Web3, where the addition of new chains often results in fragmented liquidity and an underwhelming user experience.

### Aggregation Layer (AggLayer)

https://preview.redd.it/uibcb7bwhanc1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2e680e1d67488c8928fa0e01e19503f50097a7a

In January 2024, Polygon Labs released [information](https://polygon.technology/blog/aggregated-blockchains-a-new-thesis) about the AggLayer within the Polygon ecosystem, addressing challenges in blockchain architectures by unifying the liquidity and state of ZK-secured chains. The AggLayer enables ""near-instant atomic cross-chain transactions"" and aims to unify liquidity across its ecosystem. Developers can connect any EVM L1 or L2 to the AggLayer. This allows the chains to ""maintain full sovereignty"" while enabling them to access a larger pool of liquidity, aggregated users, and dApps. The first version of AggLayer is scheduled for release in February 2024. V2 is expected later in the year, supporting asynchronous cross-chain transactions.

### Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK)

In Q3 2023, Polygon Labs released the [Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK)](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-chain-development-kit-launch-zk-l2s-on-demand-to-unlock-unified-liquidity). Polygon CDK is an open-source development framework for launching ZK L2 chains and transitioning existing EVM L1s to L2s. Polygon CDK's [primary attributes](https://messari.io/project/polygon/quarterly-reports/q3-2023#Network-Analysis) focus on customizability, interoperability, and ZKtech.

Since going live, a number of teams have announced the adoption of the CDK including: [Immutable](https://polygon.technology/blog/immutable-zkevm-testnet-is-live-on-polygon), [Astar Network](https://www.theblock.co/post/250505/astar-network-zkevm-ethereum-layer-2-polygon), [Canto](https://polygon.technology/blog/canto-to-migrate-to-a-zk-l2-powered-by-polygon-chain-development-kit), [Manta](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zk-focused-manta-pacific-opts-out-op-stack-for-polygon-cdk), [OKX](https://polygon.technology/blog/okx-launches-zkevm-layer-2-network-powered-by-polygon-cdk), [Hypr Network](https://polygon.technology/blog/hypr-network-integrates-with-polygon-cdk-to-build-zk-powered-gaming-infrastructure), [FlipKart](https://polygon.technology/blog/flipkart-to-launch-polygon-cdk-powered-chain-to-scale-firedrops), [OEV Network](https://polygon.technology/blog/api3-to-launch-a-zk-layer-2-chain-powered-by-polygon-cdk), [Libre](https://polygon.technology/blog/tokenization-spotlight-how-libre-unlocks-institutional-adoption-with-automated-compliance?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=tokenization-spotlight-libre), Aavegotchi, Accentrik, Arianee, CapX, Gameswift, Gnosis Pay, IDEX Nubank, Outerlife, Powerloom, and WireX.

In the fourth quarter, there were a number of notable CDK integrations and announcements including with [Celestia](https://polygon.technology/blog/celestias-high-throughput-out-of-the-box-data-availability-layer-to-integrate-with-polygon-cdk), [Hyper Oracle](https://polygon.technology/blog/hyperoracle-integrates-with-polygon-cdk-to-unlock-onchain-ai-and-advanced-defi), and [Gateway](https://polygon.technology/blog/erigon-client-comes-to-polygon-cdk). Additionally, Polygon Labs and the [NEAR Foundation](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-labs-and-near-foundation-collaborate-to-build-a-zkwasm-prover-as-a-component-for-polygon-cdk) entered into a collaboration to develop a ZK-prover specifically designed for WebAssembly blockchains; [NEAR DA](https://pages.near.org/blog/near-da-integrates-with-polygon-cdk-for-developers-building-ethereum-zk-rollups/) has also integrated with Polygon CDK. The zkWasm prover aims to bridge the gap between Wasm-based chains and the Ethereum ecosystem, including Polygon CDK chains.

### Polygon Miden

[Polygon Miden](https://polygon.technology/polygon-miden) is an upcoming ZK L2 rollup utilizing the Rust-based Miden Virtual Machine (MVM) instead of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Miden aims for high-throughput, private applications using ZK-proofs, emphasizing [privacy as a core feature](https://polygon.technology/blog/privacy-a-fundamental-right-and-a-practical-necessity) for scalability. Additionally, Polygon Labs introduced [Polylang](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polylang-typescript-for-miden-vm), a TypeScript-based language for Miden VM.

On September 29, Polygon Labs shared [details](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-miden-sprinting-towards-testnet-september-update) about the development of Miden and announced plans for a testnet. Leading up to this Miden testnet launch, Polygon Labs has published a series of blog posts explaining Polygon Miden’s components.

### Polygon PoS Upgrade to zkEVM Validium

As part of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade, there was a [proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187) for the Polygon PoS chain to transition into a zkEVM validium. This change enables Polygon PoS to enhance security, performance, and compatibility within an aggregated blockchain network. As a zkEVM validium, transaction data for Polygon PoS will be made available offchain, resulting in lower fees compared to traditional rollups, while maintaining robust security guarantees.

### Additional Developments

* Polygon PoS underwent the [Aalborg Hard Fork](https://messari.io/intel/event/1716dd98-eaba-4ae6-978b-c22c87152f53) on Oct. 11, 2023. This upgrade included PIP-11, which introduces a mechanism called milestones that enable faster deterministic finality.
* The Solana Foundation and Polygon Labs co-hosted the inaugural [Crypto Policy Bootcamp](https://polygon.technology/blog/the-solana-foundation-and-polygon-labs-host-inaugural-crypto-policy-bootcamp-in-d-c) in Washington D.C., aimed at fostering dialogue between policymakers and the crypto industry.
* Polygon Labs [hosted multiple events](https://polygon.technology/blog/meet-polygon-projects-helping-hong-kong-become-a-web3-hub) in Hong Kong.
* Polygon introduced a [new testing toolkit](https://polygon.technology/blog/new-polygon-pos-testing-toolkit-makes-devnet-management-easier-than-ever) for the PoS chain, simplifying the management of Devnets. This toolkit streamlines the process of creating and managing private test networks, allowing developers to test their dApps and smart contracts more efficiently.
* Polygon launched [Polygon Village 2.0](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-village-2-0-championing-founders-with-more-than-110-million-in-matic-grants-mentoring-ecosystem-support-and-more), a comprehensive support program for founders, offering over $110 million in MATIC grants.
* Polygon launched [Polygon Portal](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-portal-step-into-the-future-of-ux-in-web3), a unified user interface that simplifies the management of assets on Polygon chains and bridging to and from Ethereum.
* Polygon PoS mainnet underwent the [Agra Hard Fork](https://messari.io/intel/event/8ea796e2-049d-44b2-b40e-54a6da5a3246) on Nov. 28, 2023. This introduced the implementation of multiple PIPs.
* [Polygon ID Release 5](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-id-release-5-boosting-credential-liquidity) which enhances credential liquidity, enabling a more efficient and user-friendly experience in managing decentralized identities.

### Financial and Network Overview

https://preview.redd.it/1twx671yhanc1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=922510ab4c02cc7f77c58e7e1ec71c5bf2fd78af

# Market Capitalization

https://preview.redd.it/8xynfy0zhanc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee4eef38fee1d3d65de7a63830e0e158f4eb822

In Q4 2023, the total crypto market cap experienced a sharp increase, largely driven by anticipation surrounding spot BTC ETFs. MATIC’s circulating market cap increased 80% QoQ from $4.9 billion to $8.8 billion, outpacing the overall crypto market’s growth of 54%. This Q4 growth brought MATIC’s YoY change to 29%. MATIC’s market cap ranks in the top 15 among all crypto projects.

#### Revenue

https://preview.redd.it/l7eqbs72ianc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ced4df9958ebb3c22290ba581dc4149a9350ee58

In Q4 2023, Polygon PoS's revenue from network transaction fees surged 67% QoQ, increasing from $5.1 million to $8.4 million. On November 16, daily revenue hit a yearly peak of nearly $1 million, driven by activity surrounding [Inscription NFTs](https://messari.io/intel/event/cdb09666-8eea-48f0-89af-7ab4aba89ecb). This surge [temporarily pushed gas fees up by 1,000%](https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-gas-fees-spike-thousand-percent-ordinals-token-craze). However, these spikes quickly reverted to standard levels. Even discounting this temporary surge, Polygon's revenue for the quarter still showed an increase. For 2023, the total revenue for Polygon PoS was $37 million.

#### Supply

As part of the [Polygon 2.0 upgrade](https://polygon.technology/roadmap), MATIC is being phased out in favor of [POL](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-tokenomics). POL will enable holders to contribute to network security on various protocols in the Polygon ecosystem via a native re-staking protocol, earning rewards for diverse services. These services range from basic transaction validations to more advanced tasks like generating ZK-validity proofs. Each protocol in the Polygon ecosystem can offer customized roles and rewards for validators. Validators can choose to validate multiple chains at once to compound their rewards in a similar manner to EigenLayer’s [restaking](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) offering on Ethereum.

POL adopts an inflationary model with a yearly emission rate [subject to community governance](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-26-transition-from-matic-to-pol-validator-rewards/13046) to incentivize validator participation and fund a [community-governed treasury](https://polygon.technology/papers/pol-whitepaper).

During Q3, the Polygon Labs team unveiled three Polygon Improvement Proposals for community consideration: [PIP-17](https://messari.io/intel/event/d0e74848-22bf-4db8-a23b-f9b08a3d5b26), [PIP-18](https://messari.io/intel/event/64bb8a5b-464a-4d26-82ba-bad25378e888), and [PIP-19](https://messari.io/intel/event/a8026c81-1cb6-4643-ad6a-e8b85f482c60). PIP-17 details the POL token and its relevant contracts. PIP-18 introduces the inaugural phase of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade. PIP-19 suggests transitioning the primary gas token on Polygon PoS from MATIC to POL, emphasizing an upgrade to the PoS Plasma Bridge Contract to facilitate the token transition. On October 25, the [POL contract was deployed on mainnet](https://x.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1717134336104038580?s=20).

### Usage

https://preview.redd.it/t94iwqu3ianc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=119effe1138e3093ed86ebda905c33a15078999a

Throughout 2023, Polygon PoS experienced a consistent growth in active addresses, reaching a peak of 372,000 daily active addresses in Q4. This increase was led by the DeFi and gaming sectors. For comparison to leading Layer 2s during the same period, Optimism averaged 72,000 daily active addresses and Arbitrum 150,000.

https://preview.redd.it/itgno635ianc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9a38d71770c5a592d702d59844c3db22d900240

Daily transactions on Polygon PoS witnessed a rise of 93% QoQ, increasing from 2.3 million to 4.5 million. In late November, a surge in transactions occurred, with several days exceeding 10 million transactions, driven by an [Ordinals craze](https://x.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1736884564658921862?s=20). Even when excluding these spikes, Polygon PoS experienced an increase in daily transactions during the fourth quarter.

### Governance

[Polygon Governance 2.0](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-governance) introduces three main governance pillars for the Polygon ecosystem. Each pillar of governance will have its own unique governance framework, aiming to create scalable and efficient governance mechanisms.

* Protocol Governance: Facilitated by the Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework, providing a platform for proposing upgrades to Polygon protocols.
* System Smart Contracts Governance: Addresses upgrades of protocol components implemented as smart contracts. The Protocol Council, governed by the community, will be responsible for these upgrades.
* Community Treasury Governance: Establishes a self-sustainable ecosystem fund, the Community Treasury, to support public goods and ecosystem projects. The governance process involves two phases, starting with an independent Community Treasury Board and evolving into community-driven decision-making.

[Source: Polygon Blog](https://polygon.technology/blog/meet-the-polygon-protocol-council)

In the fourth quarter, [PIP-29](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-29-polygon-protocol-council/13075) proposed the introduction of the [Polygon Protocol Council](https://polygon.technology/blog/meet-the-polygon-protocol-council), which was adopted by the community. The council is responsible for conducting both regular and emergency upgrades to system smart contracts, specifically those components of Polygon protocols that are implemented as smart contracts on Ethereum. The Protocol Council consists of 13 publicly named members.

### Ecosystem Overview

https://preview.redd.it/3yf4h5t8ianc1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a8229f8d01999af191559744eeb1e6fc2e31780

Polygon PoS’s Total Value Locked (TVL) increased by 16% QoQ, concluding the quarter at $1.1 billion. At the end of Q4, Polygon PoS ranked sixth among blockchains based on TVL.

https://preview.redd.it/zhebp14cianc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=602ccc23011b3a2390b543f20f183d6048b20fb0

In the fourth quarter, [Aave](https://twitter.com/AaveAave) continued to lead as the dominant protocol by TVL on Polygon PoS, boasting a TVL of $520 million, which marked a 44% increase from the previous quarter and constituted 49% of the aggregate TVL. [Quickswap](https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX) followed with a TVL of $107 million, reflecting a 20% increase and accounting for 10% of the aggregate TVL. [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap) reported a TVL of $92 million, up 36% QoQ, making up 9% of the total, while [Compound's](https://twitter.com/compoundfinance) TVL rose to $78 million, a 42% increase, representing 7% of the aggregate TVL.

The most notable decline was observed in [PearlFi](https://twitter.com/PearlFi_), whose TVL fell by 97% QoQ. This decrease was due to the redemption of all liquid DAI from the USDR treasury, triggering [panic selling and a depeg](https://x.com/tangibleDAO/status/1712218741398966774?s=20). Consequently, the PearlFi team decided to [pause PEARL emissions](https://x.com/PearlFi_/status/1714782672902594872?s=20).

https://preview.redd.it/0640isjdianc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9544178c1d851c0291d799c64b62505761dda2c1

In Q4, Polygon PoS saw its average daily DEX trading volume rise to $169 million, a 74% increase from the previous quarter. Uniswap accounted for 45% of this total volume, while Quickswap contributed 28%. [Retro Finance](https://twitter.com/Retro_finance), launched on Polygon in late July, experienced a significant rise in trading volumes, claiming the third spot among DEXs with a 10% share. Overall, DEXs on Polygon PoS generated over $15.5 billion in trading volume during the fourth quarter, making it the seventh largest chain by DEX trading volume.

https://preview.redd.it/6eo0ac6fianc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f27d76cb08a1463e6408e1ba0795db67666586

The market cap of stablecoins on Polygon PoS remained steady QoQ, with a slight decrease of 3% from $1.29 billion to $1.26 billion. USDT reclaimed its position as the top stablecoin on Polygon PoS, with its market cap growing by 37% QoQ to $614 million, representing 49% of the total stablecoin market cap on Polygon PoS. In contrast, USDC saw its market cap decrease by 21% QoQ to $484 million, accounting for 39% of the total stablecoin market cap. Circle [launched native USDC](https://messari.io/intel/event/209ec2be-5ae1-47c5-8015-5c70b196daca) on Polygon PoS in October.

After a strong performance in the third quarter, driven by the [DraftKings Reignmaker NFT collection](https://www.draftkings.com/reignmakers), the NFT activity on Polygon PoS experienced a slowdown in the fourth quarter. The average daily number of NFT active addresses decreased by 57% QoQ, reaching 9,900, while the average daily number of NFT transactions dropped by 54% QoQ to 11,300. When compared YoY, NFT active addresses and transactions saw declines of 22% and 60%, respectively.

Several significant announcements emerged from the Polygon PoS NFT sector:

* Magic Eden is [expanding its support](https://www.theblock.co/post/262003/magic-eden-strengthens-support-for-polygon-with-new-features) for Polygon with new features designed to enhance the user experience and functionality for NFT interactions.
* Book.io and Trescool announced a [partnership](https://polygon.technology/blog/buy-a-digital-book-remove-co2-book-io-and-trescool-team-up-for-launch-on-polygon) to launch on Polygon, offering users the option to purchase digital books and contribute to CO2 removal efforts.
* Club Mahindra [introduced](https://polygon.technology/blog/generative-ai-meets-great-masterpieces-in-club-mahindras-nft-collection) an NFT collection that utilizes generative AI to merge iconic masterpieces.

# Gaming

https://preview.redd.it/noj2eh1jianc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=314fd2a53ea5a52b6a3556e324ab39a4ecec646b

Polygon PoS’s gaming activity has fallen for three consecutive quarters following its peak in Q1 2023. In the fourth quarter, Polygon PoS gaming averaged 11,300 daily active addresses (-54% QoQ) and 128,000 daily active transactions (-16% QoQ).

The most significant gaming-related news for the Polygon PoS gaming sector was the launch of the [Immutable zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/blog/immutable-zkevm-testnet-is-live-on-polygon) testnet in the third quarter. Immutable zkEVM is one of the first external networks to utilize the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK). This development is projected to attract a considerable number of gamers to the Polygon ecosystem. The Immutable zkEVM mainnet launch is slated for early 2024.

# Institutional

In the fourth quarter, Polygon witnessed several notable institutional developments:

[Polygon zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm) launched on March 27, 2023, as a Layer-2 Ethereum rollup. Leading protocols have integrated or announced integrations with Polygon zkEVM, including Celer Network, Synapse, Balancer, and Uniswap. In Q3, it underwent its first upgrade [Dragon Fruit](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-zkevm-dragon-fruit-is-live-on-mainnet), and in Q4 it underwent its second upgrade [Inca Berry](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-zkevm-inca-berry-upgrade-coming-to-mainnet-beta) which includes cryptographic optimizations, bug fixes, and notable changes to the prover and node systems.

Other notable announcements from the fourth quarter included support for the [Bridged USDC Standard](https://polygon.technology/blog/bridged-usdc-standard-contracts-are-live-on-polygon-zkevm), Chainlike data feeds [integration](https://polygon.technology/blog/chainlink-data-feeds-now-live-on-polygon-zkevm-unlocking-the-future-of-defi), a mechanism for more accurate transaction fee calculation called [effectiveGasPrice](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-zkevm-effective-gas-price-live-on-mainnet-beta), and [details](https://polygon.technology/blog/the-etrog-upgrade-is-on-testnet-making-polygon-zkevm-fully-type-2) about the upcoming Etrog upgrade.

### Closing Summary

In 2023, the Polygon ecosystem experienced substantial growth, marked by the introduction of Polygon 2.0 and the continuous rollout of its features. These included the deployment of the new POL token contracts, the adoption of the Polygon CDK by leading teams, and the announcement of the Aggregation Layer (AggLayer). The AggLayer, designed to unify liquidity and facilitate seamless integration across the ecosystem, alongside the Polygon CDK, is the future of the Polygon ecosystem.

The network's technical advancements were mirrored by a surge in activity; Polygon PoS's daily active addresses consistently rose each quarter, peaking at 372,000 in Q4. The fourth quarter also saw transactions skyrocket by 93% QoQ, while the TVL grew by 16% QoQ, reaching $1.1 billion.

Heading into 2024, Polygon is set to continue to develop Polygon 2.0 to enhance the network's capabilities and appeal to both users and developers. Polygon PoS already ranks among the top networks in every major category and only expects this to increase as the network evolves.

Top 5 Oasis Ecosystem Projects Redefining Web3 UX With Smart Privacy Integration - Part 1,dapps,1b8o0dq,2024-03-07 01:50:00,1,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dapps/comments/1b8o0dq/top_5_oasis_ecosystem_projects_redefining_web3_ux/,DC600A,,"Decentralized applications or dApps are the cornerstone of the web3 experience. As the blockchain and crypto space continues to push and reinvent itself, privacy has become integral to the user-friendliness of web3. Oasis Network's foray into [smart privacy](https://oasisprotocol.org/) with Sapphire (first and only confidential EVM in production) and OPL (cross-chain tool leveraging Sapphire's L1 features and functionalities as an L2 framework) has opened up a world of opportunities for developers and dApp builders. As a result, users can enjoy data sovereignty and security while exploring the world of web3 through various dApps.

During the past year, over a dozen projects have integrated with Oasis smart privacy and continue to take large strides in redefining the web3 UX with next-gen privacy-first use cases. Let's look at the top 5 who made the most impact.

1. **Enshrine Computing** \- One of the first projects to integrate Oasis Sapphire's confidential EVM and TEEs (trusted execution environment) to build autonomous computing for a more secure and self-sovereign web3. Enshrine's open-source autonomous computing network, [Escrin](https://escrin.org/) is a developer's playground with [NFTrout](https://nftrout.com/), the innovative autonomous trout NFT breeding game gaining much popularity. 
2. **Celer Network** \- The relationship between Oasis and Celer is long-standing and fruitful as it helps build the best inter-blockchain and cross-layer communication platform. Celer's [IM](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/celer-messaging-bridge-integration) (interchain messaging) and [cBridge](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/sapphire-cbridge-integration-announcement) integrations have resulted in building OPL's message-passing bridge component and secure cross-chain asset transfers on illumineX and Pancakeswap.
3. **Ocean Protocol** \- In the last six months, the [Oasis-Ocean partnership](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/ocean-oasis-strengthened-partnership-announcement) has gone from strength to strength. It started with integrating Oasis Sapphire's confidentiality solutions for the Ocean Predictoor dApp which enables privacy-assured on-chain prediction and DF (data farming). Now, the DF incentive program is running throughout 2024 while the partners recently announced a unilateral exchange of both network’s native tokens. 
4. **illumineX** \- From winning a grant from Oasis to building the first-ever confidential DEX on Oasis Sapphire, [illuimneX](https://ix.exchange) has already achieved every target it has challenged itself with so far. While confidential cross-chain (and of course on-chain) swaps among the top EVM chains are fully functional, the stage is all set to implement EVM/non-EVM interoperability. Bitcoin is the first to come on board and testing will start soon. In the meantime, illumineX has become the home for listing tokens of projects like Rosy (first memecoin on Oasis) and Vine Money (first privacy-focused omnichain stablecoin on Sapphire).
5. **PixelRealm (formerly NFTb)** \- Another Oasis grant recipient, this is a foray into something new by Oasis as it helps build a [privacy-enabled NFT marketplace](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oasis-grant-nftb-privacy-push). The reason why this is game-changing is that the platform not only supports traditional buy/sell options but also introduces [sealed bid auctions](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/sealed-bid-nft-auctions-privacy-ethereum) \- something that is a unique use case of Oasis smart privacy that no other EVM can offer. NFTrout owners are invited to try out all these features first-hand.

Which of these projects do you think is the most intriguing and can potentially transform the way we interact with and experience web3? Discuss in the comments, and stay tuned for next week when I bring you 5 more projects."

Celer is Partnering with r/CryptoCurrency to Bridge Moons to Arbitrum One!,CryptoCurrency,1amzlrd,2024-02-09 16:47:00,111,0.85,214,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1amzlrd/celer_is_partnering_with_rcryptocurrency_to/,CryptoMods,:moons: MOONS,"&#x200B;

Excited to announce that Celer has decided to support Moons, allowing users to bridge their Moons to Arbitrum one! 

The bridge will go live by **March 20, 2024** and will be multidirectional, meaning users can bridge Moons from nova to one and from one to nova. 

&#x200B;

**Reasons to bridge**

* There is significantly more liquidity on Arbitrum one ($2.76b TVL) compared to Arbitrum nova ($30m TVL)
* As Arbitrum nova is not currently a popular chain there exists the possibility of shutdown in the future
* There are a plethora of DeFi applications on Arbitrum one that Moons could be incorporated into that do not exist on nova
* Arbitrum one has support for multisig, which could be beneficial for community funds held in u/TheMoonDistributor 

&#x200B;

**Moons distributions**

https://preview.redd.it/r3faw0w3qmhc1.png?width=167&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed66aeb8a72cfdab3913d0d0f1a9370fc87a5efe

Moons distributions and tipping will still occur on nova in order to keep gas fees low. Gas fees on Arbitrum one can be significantly higher and more volatile than nova, but still they are much more manageable compared to mainnet gas fees.

&#x200B;

**Governance**

https://preview.redd.it/q783403xqmhc1.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a4b5f948f89450356b6e2457fb99c96c342e3dd

Moons bridged to Arbitrum one will retain full voting power in snapshot. Users with Moons on both networks in one wallet can simply connect and vote with their full balance. If the Moons are held in different wallets on different networks then both wallets can be connected and vote with their respective balances.

We thank you for your patience as we continue to develop utility, partnerships and expansion of the Moons ecosystem."

Now this option is not available and the only option left is to withdraw rewards for each token and chain separately. Obviously this does not make sense since the reward would be lower than the transaction fee on some chains.

I guess this option was deactivated because people tended to withdraw on chains with lower transaction fees that have low liquidity now.

I also noted that is that link to statistics with TVL is not on SGN page anymore. Whys is that? Is the team trying to hide low usage and low TVL? Btw. this data is still visible here: [https://defillama.com/bridge/celer-cbridge](https://defillama.com/bridge/celer-cbridge)"

The Luminescent Journey: AI's Tenacious Impression on the Broadcasting and Cinematic Frontier,u_FunAmbassador4648,180z3q3,2023-11-21 21:57:49,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FunAmbassador4648/comments/180z3q3/the_luminescent_journey_ais_tenacious_impression/,FunAmbassador4648,," 

Within the intricate mélange of technological wizardry, Artificial Intelligence (AI) manifests as the polestar, orchestrating immeasurable dialogues of our contemporary tapestry. As some chambers vocalize apprehensions about its enigmatic perils, another collective venerates it as the crucible — accentuating and broadening innumerable ventures. Remarkably, the media bastion is amidst colossal transformations, with AI metamorphosing from a nascent apparatus for mundane tasks to an erudite syndicate of modalities.

A pronounced manifestation of AI in the media frontier is its prowess for methodization. AI bequeaths scribes and heralds the finesse to orchestrate cyclic and data-laden endeavors, such as crafting headlines, distilling synopses, and affirming veracities. Illustratively, Reuters engages an AI mechanism, Lynx Insight, to sculpt headlines from fiscal metrics. Simultaneously, The Washington Post employs the AI alchemy, Heliograf, for succinct dispatches on athletic festivities and geopolitical events.

Nevertheless, the linchpin emerges with AI's foray into Media Asset Management (MAM). Bygone eras evaluated the worth of archived visual diaries based on one's aptitude to unearth them. The emergence of MAM modalities dreamt of rendering such reservoirs both tangible and attainable. Yet, an enigma persisted: the blueprint to adeptly label and partition an extensive trove of data?

In its resplendent aura, AI offers a remedy. [TVU Networks](https://chat.openai.com/#), an avant-garde in this arena, infuses AI algorithms — encapsulating speech-to-text, entity discernment, and facial mapping — via their [MediaMind AI](https://chat.openai.com/#) engine. This not merely eschews the painstaking odyssey of manual clip scrutiny but accomplishes this with unparalleled celerity, revealing the esoteric wealth of archived media.

The ramifications of an AI-reinforced MAM are staggering. Within journalistic cloisters, raconteurs and curators adeptly cull stashed imageries congruent with their sagas. Amidst real-time telecasts, maestros pinpoint hoarded segments that synchronize with current dialogues. In the post-production realm, montage connoisseurs swiftly identify quintessential captures and archived shards, metamorphosing the montage endeavor into an articulate and potent spectacle.

Yet, the morrow shimmers with even more awe-inspiring envisagements. Conceive a journalist crafting a fable, and in tandem, pertinent filmic slivers emerge for contemplation, all helmed by AI's profound grasp of milieu and narrative. This harmonious melding of AI and MAM avows that the quest for the exemplary cinematic narrative and the mastery to procure it reverberate in idyllic symphony.

Stalwarts like [Sony](https://chat.openai.com/#), [Grass Valley](https://chat.openai.com/#), and [Ross](https://chat.openai.com/#) are navigating the boundless horizons of AI within the broadcasting and cinematic expanse. TVU Networks, with its AI-infused media asset stewardship interface, TVU MediaMind, and portal, TVU Search, stands as an emblematic beacon, underscoring the metamorphic vigor of AI within the broadcast cosmos.

In encapsulation, AI's odyssey within the media dominion, albeit interspersed with tribulations, exudes an atmosphere of infinite vistas. As AI's tendrils delve deeper into the broadcasting and cinematic terrains, it augurs a metamorphosis of the domain, proffering unrivaled nimbleness, discernment, and originality. The impending era of broadcasting isn't just digitized — it's transcendent."

Did *all* the events of the M2 Epilogue End Screen canonically happen?,Marathon,17tbfn0,2023-11-11 22:22:00,21,0.92,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/17tbfn0/did_all_the_events_of_the_m2_epilogue_end_screen/,TheMissingVoteBallot,Lore,"WARNING, THIS ENTIRE POST IS SPOILERS FOR M2 AND MI, IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THOSE GAMES PLEASE SKIP THIS POST!

Alright, longtime Marathon fan from the 90s. I got kinda nostalgic for Marathon's story so I looked up some videos explaining Infinity's timeline, as Infinity has always been the part that's been messing with everyone's heads.

I used to be a longtime visitor of Hamish Sinclair's Marathon's Story site and even made a few email contributions to it a LONG time ago. Good to see he's still kicking around to this day.

So when I ran through the ending of Marathon 2, I got the impression it was a pretty airtight ending. The Phfor deploy the trih xeem to supernova the sun, the W'rkncacnter did not appear (or as Durandal says, may have been a legend), and the S'pht Kr help to evacuate what they could of Lh'owon before the Supernova happens.

Robert Blake escapes back to Earth thanks to the Marine clearing its crew out for them. Tycho is completely obliterated with Battle Group Seven, and the S'pht eventually defeat the Phfor Empire in their capital homeworld in 2881 with the help of the forces of Earth. Leela is now an integral part of the ""Vylan FTL network"" after she gets passed around and eventually bought by the Vylans.

Ten thousand years later, Durandal returns to Earth in a Jjarro dreadnaught named Manus Celer Dei to say hi, then blasts off.

Now that I'm a bit older and can wrap my head around the story, I've realized I somehow mushed the ending of M2 and the beginning of MI together - and now that I step back and try to figure out the timeline, Infinity is basically a full-blown retcon of the M2 Epilogue End Screen, and is an alternative universe retelling and continuation of ""All Roads Lead to Sol..."" which we all are aware of.

In fact, it appears there is no recognition or merging of the M2 Epilogue and the ""good"" ending timeline for MI, is there? Basically, we have no idea what happened after Aye Mak Sicur outside of the final end of the universe and what appears to be the S'pht-Durandal AI merged entity talking to both us as the Marine and us as the player while we watch the final moments of the universe exploding/(imploding?).

Or would it be safe to say that perhaps parts of the M2 epilogue happened? Would the S'pht-Durandal entity still have visited Earth ten thousand years later since he's closer to what the Jjarro would have been than Durandal ever was? Is Leela still with the Vylae? Did Robert Blake ever make it back?

It feels like a lot of holes were left between the MI good ending and the MI Epilogue and I've now started wondering how much of the M2 ending was retconned for the sake of a third Marathon."

"illumineX AMA Gives Insights on Confidential DEX, Plans for DeFi Ecosystem that is High on Privacy",defi,17kexzp,2023-10-31 02:48:25,3,0.8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/17kexzp/illuminex_ama_gives_insights_on_confidential_dex/,DC600A,:dex: DEX,"Last week illumineX participated in an AMA (ask me anything) session where the industry's first-ever confidential multichain DEX gave insights on illumineX, how it works, and its immediate and future plans for DeFi. The CEO of illumineX, Alice Yudina a.k.a. Liza was the guest of honor hosted by Ed.

Liza has been involved in the crypto space since 2015 and actively working in the area since 2020 with the outsourcing development team with experience in developing a wide range of products including centralized exchanging systems, MEV trading bots, and the charting platform for users, as well as DeFi products since 2021.

Ed, a well-known persona in the blockchain and crypto and web3 space, and an engaged Oasis community member, is a respected voice on Twitter (X). He is also the co-manager of the Rose Garden community group in Telegram and has been embedded across the ecosystem for almost three years now while contributing towards community building, business development, networking, and marketing activities.

Here is a transcript of the AMA.

&#x200B;

***Ed:*** Welcome, Liza. Can you please start by giving a brief overview of illumineX and share some of your vision for the project?

***Liza***: Hey Ed, and much appreciate for inviting me to the AMA. I am happy to answer any questions.

IllumineX is a regulatory-compliant confidential DEX on Oasis Sapphire, we are supported by the Oasis Foundation (they [secured a grant](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/illuminex-grant-sapphire-dex) as a precursor to building their DEX).

We are building the most convenient solution for the web3 community to move & swap in a private manner across different chains, as well as paying to others without revealing your balance on-chain. We are utilizing Oasis Sapphire EVM technology to make it possible, so all the operations are going through the Sapphire confidential smart contracts even when you are bridging from eg Ethereum Network to, say, the BNB Chain.

&#x200B;

***Ed***: That is exciting to hear! So, what motivated you to create illumineX on Oasis Network and, especially using Sapphire paratime?

***Liza***: Well, our team has always been a big fan of privacy. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right and everyone has the right to have privacy. You wouldn't want to disclose to your neighbor how much you have in your bank account or if you are paying someone for contracting work. The same applies to decentralized finance or DeFi because disclosing your balance, while good for transparency, could put you at risk, hence why privacy is needed and should be utilized!

&#x200B;

***Ed***: The need for privacy within DeFi cannot be overstated and is something I'm sure most of the community can relate to. Can you please elaborate on the role of the Oasis Network and Sapphire paratime in the functioning of illumineX?

***Liza***: Sure. Let's use an example to understand how illumineX works better.

You could deposit eg BNB as native currency on the illumineX BNB Chain smart contract, then it gets bridged into Oasis Sapphire using mutual bridge partner, [Celer Network's cBridge](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/sapphire-cbridge-integration-announcement). On Sapphire, it is being wrapped into confidential BNB and swapped into confidential ETH. After swapping, our smart contract automatically puts your confidential ETH into an unwrap buffer queue which works as a scheduled unwrap from confidential ERC20 ETH tokens into regular ERC20 ETH tokens, that can be bridged out to the Ethereum chain.

When there are enough deposits on top of your request, your tokens get automatically unwrapped and bridged out to Ethereum or whichever network you have selected, using Celer Network. The buffered queue mechanism allows us to establish a bulletproof and reliable way to protect your privacy and funds. You can also split your request into different sub-requests that will go to different addresses on the destination chain, as well as you can select different chains to receive ETH on (for example some portion of ETH will go to Arbitrum and some to the Ethereum native chain).

&#x200B;

***Ed***: Splendid, I’m excited to see Sapphire’s confidential EVM features demonstrated in this way. So, what is the roadmap for the future development and growth of illumineX?

***Liza***: Right now we are focused on the confidential DEX but in general our goal is to build the entire confidential ecosystem for DeFi. First of all, we will keep focusing on the DEX, adding more features and improvements. One of the most exciting items in the near future on the roadmap is support for native currencies on non-EVM chains, such as Bitcoin, Monero, Dash, Litecoin, etc. We already designed a technology that will allow this to work by utilizing Sapphire for atomic swaps.

Regarding the DEX, we also will add a referral system and an incentives model among other exciting developments in the pipeline. Apart from that, we are looking into building a decentralized ID (DID) system or some gaming products such as on-chain poker / other infra, more information on this later once we see what the direct needs are like for Sapphire to grow.

&#x200B;

***Ed***: Great to hear and we will be looking forward to seeing it all play out. For now, are there any plans to integrate other DeFi protocols or dApps with illumineX?

***Liza***: Yes, we are open to extending our integrations list. Right now we have partnerships with Synthr and Celer. Synthr provides [synthetical cross-chain and slippage-free ROSE](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/syrose-launch-synthr-partnership). There will be a liquidity pool for syROSE/ROSE on illumineX where people can freely convert their syROSE to ROSE and vice versa.

&#x200B;

***Ed***: The cross-chain interoperability of illumineX sounds exciting. Next, I’d like to know about the governance model for your project. Can you elaborate on how are decisions made regarding upgrades and modifications?

***Liza***: We really believe in community-driven products since it was what DeFi was created for, and for this specific reason we don’t want to go with VCs. illumineX will be controlled by the team multi-signature wallet that will require 2/3 of signatures for a decision to go through so that there is no single party as a point of failure. After the launch of the mainnet, we will start working towards making illumineX more community-driven for our future plans regarding the confidential ecosystem!

&#x200B;

***Ed***: The next question is on the topic of community. How do you plan to attract users and build a strong community around illumineX?

***Liza***: At illumineX, we firmly believe that the community is the key. We want to see organic growth of the community by utilizing a referral system that would allow anyone to invite their friends & own communities into our ecosystem and receive a portion of fees from the referrals. Volume should stimulate permanent user growth and benefit active community members as well as the entire Sapphire ecosystem. Apart from that, we will use all the partnerships and connections for some co-marketing opportunities and content sharing.

Also, in the future, part of our plan is to have illumineX confidential swaps integrated as widgets on other dApps/web3 wallets using an SDK to push this growth and use case further,  from different dApps and communities. We also plan to have a treasury (illumineX Fund) to incentivize active community members, developers, and much more through grants and incentive programs for the community.

&#x200B;

***Ed***: What about the tokenomics of illumineX and the role of your native token within the ecosystem?

***Liza***: We do have plans for a native token for our ecosystem and we are developing the tokenomics which we hope to release in conjunction with the public testnet on November 3. We will also go live soon with our website. So, stay tuned for all that.

As with any healthy tokenomics, we believe there must be balanced buying and selling pressure. We know illumineX has a strong demand as a product, we have seen similar products (confidential multichain swaps) that were centralized, but very successful. We will have buybacks & burn mechanisms from the protocol revenue that will gradually increase over time percentage-wise. We are also considering rebate mechanisms for the referrers who hold the illumineX native token!

&#x200B;

***Ed***: For the final question, it is what almost every web3 and DeFi user has in mind. We’ve all heard about projects, irrespective of how they manage privacy, being under scrutiny. So, how do you ensure compliance with regulations, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)?

***Liza***: That’s a great question. We really love and value privacy but at the same time, we understand that in our harsh reality, it can be abused by malicious actors. It was a tricky thing for the team but we managed to resolve it and prepare a compliance system that would allow us to stay transparent with the community at the same time.

In case of a court order / 3rd party legal data request, illumineX can request access to view some parts of the transaction to meet regulatory requirements. To the users, rest assured. Your transaction data is not visible/public to anyone by default or even by the illumineX protocol (only after the publicly visible on-chain data request). Hopefully, this feature won’t be needed at all, but at the same time as a protocol, it is required from the regulatory point of view.

***Ed***: And that brings us to the end of the AMA. Huge thank you to Liza for introducing illumineX and answering all these questions in detail. Wish you all the best with the upcoming launch.

&#x200B;

"Scaling Privacy on Ethereum, Rollups, and Beyond with the Oasis Privacy Layer",Crypto_General,17f4sfr,2023-10-24 00:50:06,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/17f4sfr/scaling_privacy_on_ethereum_rollups_and_beyond/,VicmxD,,"The OPL or Oasis Privacy Layer is an EVM compatible cross-chain solution that enables the connection between Web 3 networks and the Confidential EVM Sapphire, through the support of messaging bridges and paymasters/gas relayers. This means that any public blockchain network is able to leverage Confidential Smart Contracts if there is a messaging bridge that integrates with the Oasis Privacy Layer and is able to communicate with the public chain.

An example is the Celer Messaging Bridge, which connects with most popular EVM compatible chains, including Ethereum, BNB chain, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc. Another is the soon-to-be-integrated Oraichain, which will enable Oasis Confidential Smart Contracts' customizable privacy over the Cosmos Ecosystem. However, this is still a work in progress.

Now, the question is: how seamless will this integration be? how will user pay for gas fees? This is were paymasters and gas relayers step in. They will enable gas sponsorship to users by dApp developers themselves, or even enable you to pay for gas fees using your home-chain native token, without needing to exchange it for Rose to be able to enjoy Smart Privacy. This is possible thanks to EIP 4337, or Account Abstraction as coined by Vitalik Buterin 2021 and implemented on the Ethereum Mainnet in March 2023.

But what happens in the case scenario where you want to use a specific dApp on one of the affiliated chains, but you don't have tokens in that chain and you need to pay for gas on your own? In this case, there are two solutions to increase interoperability between chains in the OPL. The introduction of syROSE, a synthetic token made by SYNTHR to increase liquidity and scalability, enabling seamless low-slippage cross-chain swaps between the Oasis Network native Rose token and assets from industry-leading blockchains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, BNB chain and more. This makes it easier to obtain the tokens to use privacy-enabled dApps throughout Web3.

If you don't prefer this approach, you will be able to use Illuminex, a Confidential Multichain Decentralized Exchange that enables MEV-free token transfers for all chains connected through the OPL. This path enables you to seamlessly obtain the tokens you need and engage with privacy-enabled dApps throughout Web3. Illuminex will also have a pool for syROSE x ROSE, providing an opportunity for liquidity providers to earn yield by supporting both efforts through a pegged-asset pair with low impermanent loss.

With the growth and evolution of Web3 in mind, these efforts strive for a more interoperable, scalable and secure Web3 without borders, addressing an intrinsic problem of public Web3 chains: immutable transparency. However, with the integration Customizable Smart Privacy into every chain through the Oasis Privacy Layer, transparency is now optional for every dApp and DAO in any ecosystem.

"Meet Predictoor: The AI-powered Prediction DApp by Ocean Protocol, Oasis, and Celer",Crypto_General,17ess4v,2023-10-23 15:27:34,7,0.9,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/17ess4v/meet_predictoor_the_aipowered_prediction_dapp_by/,Future-Goose7,,"In Web3, getting predictions right is super important. Crypto enthusiasts who use cryptocurrencies want predictions they can trust and value the privacy of their actions based on that data unless they specify otherwise. Ocean's Predictoor introduces this to Web3, and it's backed by Oasis, which provides the dApp with Oasis Sapphire's programmable confidentiality features, and Celer Network cBridge to connect OCEAN from the Ethereum mainnet to Sapphire.

How does the Predictoor Works

Ocean Predictoor is an on-chain dApp that relies on crowd-sourced predictions and their verification. People can submit predictions and stake on them, with rewards for correct predictions and losses for incorrect ones. Traders can buy aggregate predictions from the Predictoor dApp to trade assets or contracts. This encourages accuracy within the Predictoor stack through these dynamics.

Users can earn in three ways:

1. As a Predictoor: Participant in to play with [Predictoor.ai](https://Predictoor.ai) => Do Challenge DF: one-off predictions => Run a predictoor bot: continuous predictions => Optimize the bot.

2. As a Trader: Traders need to play with the dapp, and trade => Run a trader bot => Optimize the bot to increase earnings.

3. As a Data Farmer:  This involves locking OCEAN tokens for veOCEAN to earn passive rewards or maximize earnings by curating data assets with high data consumption (such as Predictoor assets) with veOCEAN to earn ""Volume DF"" active rewards.

This multifaceted tool opens diverse opportunities for users to participate, contribute, and prosper in crypto. What do you think about the significance of accurate and secure predictions in the Web3 environment, and have you had any encounters with Predictoor by Ocean or similar platforms?"

We are requested to integrate with the LPG System which uses PLC via Modbus. They provided me with this table and after a while I managed to extract the meter readings and tanks’ levels (As you see I had to use move and use even %MW because when they were next to each other and the value I received where not correct)
What I need help in is the Alarms, (as far as I understand unlike the other two this one is 16 bit where all/some bits represent an alarm). What I need is to take each bit alone. They use XEC-DR46H and the software is XG5000. If someone knows a way to solve this problem from either side (PLC or Nexus) please help me.
 
TL;DR I need to move each bit of a 2 byte word to a different %MW so I can make an alarm for it in BMS."

https://celerscan.com

I check it every few days and today featured the most transactions I’ve seen in ~2 months. Hopefully a sign of things to come and a ripple in the water before Nessy rises. 

On the flip side, I lodged a support ticket about Analytics being down for months now and was just told ‘the site had to be taken down to allow it to be improved’ …which didn’t really gel with me. I can’t see any good reason for it to still be down other than large infrastructural changes to the product or API but at least with CelerScan we have an indication the network is being utilised and we can see real value being generated. 

We are just shy of 2m total transactions and I can’t wait to see what activity the rising market brings 🍿"

Nokia touts Dish as the first user of its new API platform,Nok,16ssl4s,2023-09-26 12:27:13,14,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nok/comments/16ssl4s/nokia_touts_dish_as_the_first_user_of_its_new_api/,Mustathmir,News,"**Nokia on Tuesday announced its new Network as Code platform and said that Dish Network is the first network operator to agree to use the platform.** The move isn't surprising considering Nokia supplies Dish's 5G standalone core. But, according to Nokia's Shkumbin Hamiti, Dish isn't the only network operator that will use the platform. He said **five other unnamed network operators are currently preparing to make use of Nokia's new platform. ""We hope to increase this number**,"" said Hamiti, the head of Nokia's Network Monetization Platform Business Unit. The launch of Nokia's new Network as Code platform comes just days after Nokia rival Ericsson announced the launch of its own platform for network application programming interfaces (APIs). Germany's Deutsche Telekom said it would be the first network operator to offer developers APIs into its network through a partnership with Ericsson's Vonage.

Broadly, the efforts reflect growing momentum around networking APIs, and interest among network operators and networking vendors to expose those APIs to enterprise developers that might wish to pay for them. Hamiti, of Nokia, said **the company's new API platform would initially support a handful of APIs including quality of service (QoS) on demand, network slice management and selection, device location and device insights. He said the company hopes to add other APIs shortly including one that would provide network insights.** Hamiti said Nokia would offer the APIs directly to enterprise developers, and then would share its resulting revenues with participating operators. He said there are a handful of reasons why Nokia is launching its new API platform now. ""There is a concern about the financial future of all the telco operators out there,"" he said, explaining that they are ""very motivated"" to expose network APIs in order to make more money. **Nokia estimates that the global, industrywide opportunity for network APIs could generate up to $26 billion in revenues by 2030**.
