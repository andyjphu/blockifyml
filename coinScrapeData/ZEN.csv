Is Horizen the Key to Privacy and Customizable Blockchains?,AltcoinAdvisor,1i80156,2025-01-23 04:59:10,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltcoinAdvisor/comments/1i80156/is_horizen_the_key_to_privacy_and_customizable/,Mental_Temperature_2,,"Horizen has been building since 2017 growing from ZenCash to a complete ecosystem that focuses on privacy and scalability. Its sidechain solution Zendoo, and use of zk-SNARKs to boost security make it unique. Developers can build customizable blockchains and dApps choosing privacy options, consensus mechanisms, and other features to suit different needs.

The project supports EVM through its EON sidechain letting Ethereum-savvy developers work in its ecosystem. Their ZEN token plays a vital role within the ecosystem. It‚Äôs used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking and incentivizing participants. With a capped supply of 15.82 million, ZEN is designed to have long-term value. You can also find it listed on Bitget, they currently have PoolX event ongoing, so you can lock your ZEN to get more zen  


Kinda cool how they empowers developers with tools to create custom blockchain solutions while prioritizing privacy. but what do you guys think about blockchain ecosystems like this that put privacy first?"
Will Horizen Improve Scalbility and Privacy?,Crypto_Currency_News,1i77tra,2025-01-22 05:03:21,5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_Currency_News/comments/1i77tra/will_horizen_improve_scalbility_and_privacy/,PureClass247,,"Those who have been around the crypto space for a while will be familiar with ZenCash and its journey. while i was going through my daily routine on X, i saw their token $ZEN trending and i was curious to see what was up.

Basically, ZenCash was later rebranded as Horizen Chain and it is a blockchain ecosystem focused on privacy and scalability, using its sidechain solution, Zendoo, to support the creation of both public and private blockchains and decentralized applications.

It seems the reason $ZEN was trending on X earlier yesterday was because they were going to list on tier 1 CEXs like Bitget and this propelled it to spotlight. Hope they will be able to sustain their promised faster transactions and lower fees for years."

Horizen (ZEN)'s Ascent: Navigating the Impact of Grayscale Trust and Technological Evolution  
  
Abstract  
  
The cryptocurrency Horizen (ZEN) has recently captured the market's attention through a combination of strategic developments and institutional validations. This analysis delves into the significant price surge of ZEN following Grayscale's launch of the Horizen Trust, providing qualified investors with exposure to ZEN. We explore how this move has not only influenced ZEN's market performance but also set a precedent for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies in institutional investment spaces. Furthermore, the paper examines the upcoming Horizen 2.0 upgrade, focusing on its potential to revolutionize ZEN's functionality through enhanced EVM for ZK applications and improved scalability. Market sentiment, technical analysis, and the implications of new exchange listings are critically assessed to forecast ZEN's trajectory. This paper also considers the challenges and risks, including regulatory scrutiny and market volatility, that could impact ZEN's growth. By synthesizing these factors, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of ZEN‚Äôs current market position and its prospects in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Ingredients for a Blockchain: Unveiling the Core Components of DigiByte,Digibyte,1hptj13,2024-12-30 13:16:35,22,0.97,3,https://medium.com/@pappawecho/ingredients-for-a-blockchain-unveiling-the-core-components-of-digibyte-d6ed53fc4090,romeo_laui,Article üì∞,"This article provides information for an upcoming presentation at a UTXO Alliance Town Hall. Consider it a read-ahead to inform the community about the information that will be presented. Laura Taylor and I are volunteer DigiByte community representatives for the UTXO Alliance. 

The UTXO Alliance is a consortium of several blockchains, blockchain projects, and research groups, including Nervos, Komodo, Horizen Labs, Wolfram Blockchain Labs, Input Output (IOHK), DigiByte, Ergo, Topl, Alephium, Cardano, Zen Gate, Hathor, and the University of Zurich. 

The presentation is part of the UTXO-Alliance UTXO Handbook initiative. The handbook serves as a resource detailing the similarities and differences between different UTXO model blockchains, hence the different flavors of UTXO models based on key ingredients for each blockchain. The information is highly technical, with examples that a non-technical person can conceptualize.

Lastly, this will be presented at a UTXO Alliance Town Hall and will serve as an example of resource utilization, kind of like an experiment. This will be a sample of one, and follow-on Alliance members can build upon this presentation. Perhaps the information in the handbook will be refined, or Alliance members may decide to use parts of the presentation for their own purposes. Hopefully, this gives you insight into the presentation, the UTXO Alliance, and its members."

Would like to thank alot the crypto community here, I've
learned alot from all the discussions and back and forth
of opinions


I started doing well for myself and decided that i need to start investing to help acclerate myself financially (achieve FIRE)


I decided by asking myself how much i can afford to lose to experiment with the crypto market.


Answer was about 1000 euro


Here are my current holdings and weights as you can see

XRP 198.09 XRP   ‚Ç¨423.65 down 14.42%


Horizen 12.024 ZEN    ‚Ç¨311.33 up 4.81%


Uniswap 14.79 UNI   ‚Ç¨188.5 down 16.66%


Chainlink 6.56 LINK  ‚Ç¨138.6 down 9.68%


-i noticed all cyprto markets is heavily influenced by bitcoin movement


‚Ä¢ my philosophy is to pick coins backed up by an
application in real-life
‚Ä¢ i can see there's trends towards end of Q1 in the past 2
years
‚Ä¢ my stop losses are at -50%


My goal is to invest for my first 100k


My questions


1- is my portfoli selection ok? How would you improve it?


2-i was shaken by the market going down in the prev 2 weeks, yet decided not be another paper weight Question is .. where should i set my sell limit order?

3-i understand coins are seasonal hence you should
sell/buy and not stick to a coin for more than 6 months.
Any extra guidance here


4- would appreciate any general guidance/tips on how
to be strategic rather than emotional and when to cut ur
losses when necessary


Much thanks in advance "

Don't invest into meme coins,AllCryptoBets,1f124cj,2024-08-25 13:41:41,1,0.6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1f124cj/dont_invest_into_meme_coins/,ILostMy2FA,Educational ,"It is mostly rugs and scams, and it doesn't have any benefits or a proper blockchain of its own (look how they're all either made on top of Sol or another coin/network). They have no utility, no mining, no masternodes as normal crypto coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin and all the others.

I have seen a fair share of people losing all their belongings to an anonymous dev who gets to cash big and live the luxury, then immediately jumps to another meme coin project to rinse and repeat.

Instead you'd want to invest into crypto coins with their own blockhains, and if you want, you can get involved by either mining, or starting a masternode (which usually has monthly ROI).

I personally invested into masternodes for these coins:

- Horizen (interesting, it was launched by a real company and the CEO is active on LinkedIn and other social channels - even does podcasts on Youtube sometimes). Founded in 2017 as ZenCash (then renamed later).
- Bitcoin 2 (similar to Bitcoin, except that it doesn't use mining, but staking, so the mechanism is Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work), also has faster transactions than Bitcoin and cheaper fees. Founded in 2018
- Energi (I liked the concept since they're active as they are hiring, and that they also have their own chain, and a chain on Eth). Founded in 2017.
- Cryptoshares (I loved their desktop wallet on Windows, it seemed very different to the usual ones which are generally copied from the open source wallets for other coins) but also liked the masternode rewards which are an average of 60 units of it, every an hour and so. It also works with staking rather than mining. Founded in 2022.

These were my personal bets, and I focused on those for which I can start a masternode and earn rewards, I prefered these they involved devs and teams, and also have support channels such as Discord or Telegram to ask for example (for the case of Horizen, they have a ticketing system).

It not only feels more secure and safe than meme coins, it actually is since the prices go up and down more reasonably than with meme's complete volatility.

Anyway, i tracked down the hacked address, and the hacker continued to flip coins to other wallets

The hacker collected people's hacked Zen, collected them, made several wallets of 100,000 Zen, and sold them to Binance

I don't know why or how it was hacked in such large quantities around the same time. Also, i suspect Horizen's system. Of course, it's baseless

Anyway, it was a lot of money for me, but I think it was a time when I realized more deeply about the complement to the blockchain

1. **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Despite its increasing difficulty and the need for sophisticated hardware (ASIC miners), Bitcoin remains the most popular and lucrative option for many miners, especially considering its historical value appreciation.
2. **Ethereum (ETH)**: With the completion of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum mining might transition fully to staking. However, if mining is still viable, it remains a top choice due to its widespread use and potential for growth.
3. **Litecoin (LTC)**: Known as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, Litecoin offers quicker transaction times and a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt), making it accessible for miners with less powerful hardware.
4. **Dogecoin (DOGE)**: Initially started as a joke, Dogecoin has a large community and has seen significant price increases, making it an interesting option for miners looking for lower difficulty and potential rewards.
5. **Monero (XMR)**: Monero's focus on privacy and security, along with its ASIC-resistant algorithm (RandomX), makes it attractive for miners using CPUs and GPUs, ensuring accessibility and profitability.
6. **Zcash (ZEC)**: Zcash offers strong privacy features and uses the Equihash algorithm, which is ASIC-resistant. It's a good choice for miners concerned with anonymity and those using GPUs.
7. **Ravencoin (RVN)**: Designed to handle the efficient creation and transfer of assets from one party to another, Ravencoin uses the KAWPOW algorithm, making it friendly for GPU miners.
8. **Ethereum Classic (ETC)**: As the original Ethereum chain, Ethereum Classic has maintained its mining model and could see increased interest from miners who wish to continue mining Ethereum-based tokens.
9. **Beam (BEAM)**: Beam utilizes the MimbleWimble protocol, focusing on privacy and scalability. Its mining algorithm is designed to be ASIC-resistant, favoring GPU miners.
10. **Horizen (ZEN)**: With its sidechain technology allowing for the creation of decentralized applications, Horizen uses the Equihash algorithm and offers privacy features, making it a potentially profitable mining choice.

Blackrock Bitcoin ETF: Is there any evidence that this could potentially be a Bitcoin SV ETF?,bitcoincashSV,18xzmj3,2024-01-03 19:52:54,3,0.62,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/18xzmj3/blackrock_bitcoin_etf_is_there_any_evidence_that/,Zealousideal_Set_333,,"Yesterday a now somewhat infamous ""fake news"" story was published that Blackrock is considering Bitcoin SV as a potential investment opportunity:

[Cory on X: ""üö® BREAKING üö® @BlackRock press release Subject: Blackrock Considers Bitcoin SV as a Potential Investment Opportunity New York, Jan/02/2024 Blackrock acknowledges the evolving landscape of digital assets and blockchain technology. As a forward-thinking financial institution, https://t.co/GnwMHuYkWW"" / X (twitter.com)](https://twitter.com/CorySealeOnX/status/1742305373615276450)

That caused quite a stir to debunk the obvious fake, which some people may have initially believed for a short time.  Although, most of the BSV community found the whole ordeal funny.  (I laughed -- sorry if that makes me a terrible human.) 

I don't think debunking that ""fake news"" will do anything to change the hearts or minds of any BSVers about the potential for Blackrock to consider BSV investments, which many already believe.

However, a more important point of discussion: Why do you believe that Blackrock is potentially considering a BSV investment?

Background information: This is the most recent filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust: [bit20231227\_s1a.htm (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923035559/bit20231227_s1a.htm)

Relevant passages:

>History of Bitcoin  
>The Bitcoin network was initially contemplated in a white paper that also described bitcoin and the operating software to govern the Bitcoin network. The white paper was purportedly authored by Satoshi Nakamoto. However, no individual with that name has been reliably identified as bitcoin‚Äôs creator, and the general consensus is that the name is a pseudonym for the actual inventor or inventors. The first bitcoins were created in 2009 after Nakamoto released the Bitcoin network source code (the software and protocol that created and launched the Bitcoin network). The Bitcoin network has been under active development since that time by a loose group of software developers who have come to be known as core developers.  

>The Bitcoin network uses a cryptographic protocol to govern the interactions within the Bitcoin network. A loose community known as the core developers has evolved to informally manage the source code for the protocol. Membership in the community of core developers evolve over time, largely based on self-determined participation in the resource section dedicated to bitcoin on Github.com.  

>Any name change and any associated rebranding initiative by the *core developers*, users or miners of bitcoin or the Bitcoin network may not be favorably received by the digital asset community, which could negatively impact the value of bitcoin and the value of the Shares.  
>From time to time, digital assets may undergo name changes and associated rebranding initiatives. For example, Bitcoin Cash may sometimes be referred to as Bitcoin ABC in an effort to differentiate itself from any Bitcoin Cash hard forks, such as Bitcoin Satoshi‚Äôs Vision, and in the third quarter of 2018, the team behind Zen rebranded and changed the name of ZenCash to ‚ÄúHorizen.‚Äù  

>A hard fork may adversely affect the price of bitcoin at the time of announcement or adoption. For example, the announcement of a hard fork could lead to increased demand for the prefork digital asset, in anticipation that ownership of the prefork digital asset would entitle holders to a new digital asset following the fork. The increased demand for the prefork digital asset may cause the price of the digital asset to rise. After the hard fork, it is possible the aggregate price of the two versions of the digital asset running in parallel would be less than the price of the digital asset immediately prior to the fork. Furthermore, while the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, determine which network is generally accepted as the Bitcoin network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trust‚Äôs purposes, there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the network and the associated digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork. Either of these events could therefore adversely impact the value of the Shares.   

>A *future* fork in the Bitcoin network could adversely affect the value of the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate.

\--

As I read it, the SEC filing clearly defines that the Bitcoin network it is referring to is the one managed by a loose community of core developers (i.e. Bitcoin Core).  The filing acknowledges a risk for future forks of this Bitcoin managed by the core developers, based on examples of past forks such as Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision. This is worded as a forward-looking risk statement for Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin described in the filing is clearly stated as being the one managed by core developers on GitHub.

So: if you believe that Blackrock may be considering a Bitcoin SV ETF, why do you think that?  Is it based on this filing? If so, what in this filing makes you believe that?  Is it based on something else, like your opinion of the likely outcome of COPA vs. Wright?

Thank you for your input."

Highest return Grayscale product 2025 Bull Run (for IRA): DEFG defi trust? HZEN Horizen trust?,CryptoCurrency,17twqmu,2023-11-12 18:17:05,8,0.69,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/17twqmu/highest_return_grayscale_product_2025_bull_run/,TheRealTheory001,DISCUSSION,"For IRA consideration, which Grayscale products would you buy today for  the highest return in 2025 bull run?   Obviously custodial crytpo carries risks vs self custody, but for funds stuck in an IRA, there is nothing else that offers the return.   We're talking about a tiny IRA, like 5%  investment.  So the goal is highest risk/reward. Hats off to people who bought the BTC bottom at 50%  discount, or SOL. That would be the play.  But starting from today:

BTC & ETH premiums are about zero'd out and would probably offer a 3x to 7x.

Most of the alts trusts are trading at multiples of their value.  I'll wait for a cool off either way.  Solana is at 10x premium.   I may still go 20% into SOL if there is a pullback but does anyone see paying $600 for $60 SOL as a good move?  Usually by bull peak, the premium diminishes fwir.

I'm looking at DEFG defi trust which is trading close to zero premium. Composition:  UNI Uniswap 40%/ LDO Lido DAO 20%/  AAVE Aave 15%/ MKR Maker dao13%/ SNX Synthetix 7%/ CRV Curve 5%.     UNI is going KYC in January 2024, so if it loses market share it could hurt it's price significantly.  But I think this one may be the best return? UNI is still 87% down from ATH. LDO 68%,  AAVE 85%.

The other options are

Horizen ZEN (93% down, 35% premium).

ZCash (90% down, 10% discount)

Livepeer (83% down, 45% premium/overcharge)

ETC/Eth Classic (87% down, 40% discount).  This is interesting (mining/not security), other than the fact that ETC moons for 1 day every cycle and if you miss it it's back down 80% the next day.

LTC Litecoin - (80% down/7% premium) didn't make new ATH 2021, not much market interest or hype.

The other alts are all trading at multiples of valuation.

I'm considering 10% BTC / 10% ETH / 40% to 50% Defi trust  and splitting the rest among the alts above maybe.   What would you go with for a 80% certainty of max gains?  I hold out that BTC could do an 8x from 30k if there were a pullback.  I don't know if all the ETF's will take off that fast though, it could take another cycle for institutions to get comfortable."

*italic part was edited after a comment found an error*

So, on the one hand we are told that by voting on the plan we will be eligible to receive our share of litigation proceeds. On the other hand, if you vote yes on the plan then you automatically *lose your right to OPT OUT* of the Third-Party Release, meaning that you relinquish your right to have any claim or suit or damages against all of the people listed on the Schedule of Excluded Parties, which includes basically all of the parties which we would want to go after, including Alex and Christy Mashinsky, Shlomi, StakeHound, 3AC, etc..

But don't worry, you get 5% more of whatever is left from the people who do hire their own attorneys and don't opt out of this bullshit.

How many times are we going to fall for 5% more.. Kirkland & Ellis and those they represent are laughing at us.

I don't mean to make you feel bad. The whole process is designed to make you think you're doing the right thing by voting yes. But the more I read it, the less I am convinced that this is the way to go. Nothing in the document is binding, and all financial projections and calculations are subject to change.

IMHO, they are rushing the process not in order to get your money back faster, but because they know the longer the process goes on, the more obvious the fraud and criminal theft will become.

How I generate a few thousand dollars a month with my risk-averse tactics.,passive_income,14xnhme,2023-07-12 08:40:39,0,0.33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/14xnhme/how_i_generate_a_few_thousand_dollars_a_month/,blockchainsoldier01,My Experience,"I‚Äôve been involved in the crypto space for some time now, and I‚Äôd like to share my experience and the tactics I‚Äôve employed to generate a steady income month after month.

Before we dive in, let me assure you that this isn‚Äôt some get-rich-quick scheme or a promotional piece. Instead, these are real strategies that have worked for me, focusing on risk management and long-term sustainability.

**#1: Masternodes ‚Äî A Steady Stream of Passive Income**

One of the most fascinating opportunities I stumbled upon in the crypto world was investing in masternodes. When I first started, I researched various masternode projects and carefully analyzed their fundamentals. I looked for projects with a strong team, their growth, the utility of their platform and tokens, the ROI offered, and their vibrant community. It was important for me to choose those projects that aligned with my approach.

Two masternode projects that I invested in based on this approach include:

* Horizen (ZEN): With a market capitalization of $86 million, Horizen has been making waves since 2018. The primary requirement to run a supernode on Horizen is 500 ZEN ($3545 at the time of writing), and it offers an ROI of 8.25%.
* Morpheus Network (MNW): Morpheus Network has a unique selling point- it‚Äôs aimed to solve a real-world crisis, and its market cap of $53 million indicates its growth potential. The primary requirement for running a masternode in the Morpheus Network network is 1800 MNW ($2033 at the time of writing), offering an impressive ROI of 18%.

Once I identified promising projects, I set up my masternodes. I diversified my investments across different projects to spread the risk. By doing so, I established a reliable stream of passive income that helps me generate a significant portion of my monthly earnings.

**#2: Tokenized Real Estate ‚Äî Combining Stability and Crypto**

For more stability in my investments, I sought opportunities to invest in assets that have stood the test of time. That‚Äôs when I discovered tokenized real estate, an innovative concept that merges the world of traditional investments with the flexibility and accessibility of crypto.

Tokenized real estate allows investors to own fractions of properties, lowering the entry barrier and providing exposure to the real estate market. These tokens are typically backed by physical assets such as commercial properties, residential buildings, or land.

The two platforms I used to buy tokenized real estate include RealT and Landshare. They allow users to invest in this asset class for as little as $50 and offer an ROI of 15‚Äì25%, along with other benefits like auto compounding, rental income and property appreciation. Some other platforms to check out that offer similar services include Realio, Brickken and tZero.

Investing in tokenized real estate projects exposed me to a stable asset class with a history of long-term appreciation. The added benefit of blockchain technology ensures transparency, fractional ownership, and the ability to liquidate my holdings if necessary.

It‚Äôs essential to note that these tactics aren‚Äôt a guaranteed path to instant riches. Instead, they form part of a broader strategy focused on risk management and sustainable growth. Diversification remains a fundamental principle in my approach. I spread my investments across various masternode projects and carefully select tokenized real estate opportunities in different markets.

Remember, these tactics require thorough research, careful evaluation, and understanding of the risks involved!"
"Horizen (ZEN) changed system, no longer an anonymous coin",Horizen,14ohnnv,2023-07-02 03:04:46,10,1.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horizen/comments/14ohnnv/horizen_zen_changed_system_no_longer_an_anonymous/,WooDance8799,,"Horizen (ZEN) announced on June 28 that it will no longer consider itself a privacy coin, but will instead become a cryptocurrency to be used as an asset.

Specifically, in the Zen 4.1 version expected to be deployed in September, Horizen will make changes to remove the transaction anonymization feature.  The Horizen development team said: ‚ÄúZEN will no longer be an anonymous coin after blockchain removes transaction anonymity. We are working with our exchange partners to ensure that all purchases of ZEN will continue to run as normal.‚Äù

&#x200B;

With this change is it good news to buy more ZEN? Currently in my portfolio 40% is ZEN and 60% is RBIF. Is it okay to buy more RBIFs in a situation like this?

Best Masternodes for Passive Income in 2023: Maximise your ROI with these platforms.,CryptoMoon,148fz22,2023-06-13 09:52:19,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/148fz22/best_masternodes_for_passive_income_in_2023/,blockchainsoldier01,DISCUSSION,"Masternodes are a great way to earn passive income within the crypto space that is becoming increasingly popular because they offer high returns without investing much time or effort and are low-risk.

Masternodes are basically special nodes that run software programs and are responsible for validating transactions and securing a network. By running them, users can earn rewards for helping to secure the network and process transactions.

Here are some of the best masternodes for passive income in 2023:

\- Dash (DASH): One of the pioneers in the masternode arena, Dash continues to dominate the market with its impressive performance. They have a proven track record for delivering solid returns, and the ROI for Dash masternodes is around 7% per year.

\- Zcoin (XZC): Zcoin is making waves in the privacy coin space, armed with cutting-edge technology and a robust focus on user anonymity. They help users conceal their transaction history, enhancing privacy to unprecedented levels. They have an ROI of approximately 8% per year.

\- Morpheus Network (MNW): With a focus on supply chain optimization and automated workflows, Morpheus Network aims to transform global trade and logistics. Their steady performance in the last 6 years and partnership with giants like Coca Cola is a testimony to their success. They have an APR of 16% per year.

\- Horizen (ZEN): They aim to create a privacy-focused platform with enhanced scalability. Currently, Horizen offers an appealing annualized ROI of around 8.5%.

\- PIVX (PIVX): This platform provides swift transactions and complete privacy powered by a PoS consensus mechanism. They have an estimated annualized ROI of 6.5%.

Some additional things to consider when choosing a Masternode Project:

Security: The project should have a strong security team and a track record of security.

Community: The project should have a strong community that is supportive of the project.

Liquidity: The project should have a liquid market so that you can easily sell your coins if you need to.

What have your experiences been in this space so far, and are you keeping an eye out for any masternode programs in 2023?"

Where have I gotten exchanges cheaper than most wallets?,BasedOnCrypto,11sq957,2023-03-16 06:31:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BasedOnCrypto/comments/11sq957/where_have_i_gotten_exchanges_cheaper_than_most/,Future-Tomorrow,,"[changeNOW](https://changenow.io/)

How did I find them? I noticed this when interacting with support and the r/ExodusWallet and r/atomicwallet subs. mods would mention them repeatedly as ""an exchange partner"". Someone also made a comment once suggesting they had better rates. 

They do. I love both the aforementioned wallets, with Exodus being my main wallet but they all make their money (profits) through their relationships with various exchange partners. I no longer do exchanges in wallets.

ChangeNOW also has awesome customer service.

If your exchange is taking longer than expected, don't freak out! It may have nothing to do with ChangeNOW. Just 2 days ago I was doing an exchange that took like 6.5 hours. When I checked the Ledger messages and Zenexplorer the problem was with Horizen/ZEN and had nothing to do with ChangeNOW."

Who Will Profit from Custodial Recurring Payments in Horizen?,NOWPayments_official,11f5yy2,2023-03-01 10:02:09,1,0.66,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOWPayments_official/comments/11f5yy2/who_will_profit_from_custodial_recurring_payments/,dim_saucer,,"Are you looking for a convenient and secure way to accept cryptocurrency payments from your clients? Look no further than NOWPayments' Custodial Recurring Payments feature.  


With this tool, businesses can offer their clients the ability to fund their accounts with cryptocurrency and use it to pay for products and services. /r/Horizen is one such cryptocurrency that can be used to facilitate these payments quickly and at low cost.  


Online casinos, VPN and hosting providers, online marketplaces, and the gaming industry can all benefit from accepting #ZEN payments. For example, online casinos can significantly reduce their expenses by utilizing this form of digital money with low transaction fees and peer-to-peer transactions. Implementing the Custodial Recurring  
Payments tool via NOWPayments can further reduce costs by allowing users to add a large sum to their balance once instead of making a fresh transaction every time they want to access any of the games on the platform.  


Privacy is also a key advantage of using Horizen for payments, making it an ideal choice for VPN and hosting providers to offer their clients complete confidentiality. Online marketplaces can expand their reach to customers from all over the world without geographic limitations, while the gaming industry can provide a more secure and transparent payment option for their clients.  


**üëâ** [**Enabling the Custodial feature**](https://nowpayments.io/blog/who-will-profit-from-custodial-recurring-payments-in-horizen) in your NOWPayments account is all it takes to begin using the Custodial Recurring Payments API and offer your clients a seamless and efficient payment experience."

Another Privacy Coin Bites the Dust,Monero,1112xv7,2023-02-13 03:03:18,122,0.98,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/1112xv7/another_privacy_coin_bites_the_dust/,kgsphinx,,"I think this piece of news is actually relevant to the Monero community even though it might not seem immediately obvious.  The Horizen project has essentially decided to remove privacy from their protocol.  ZEN is a fork of Zclassic, which was a fork of Zcash.  You can see a couple blog posts from the founders here:

[https://blockoperations.com/why-remove-private-transactions-from-horizen/](https://blockoperations.com/why-remove-private-transactions-from-horizen/)

[https://medium.com/@robviglione/my-thoughts-on-horizen-zen-being-a-privacy-coin-9a1749be3543](https://medium.com/@robviglione/my-thoughts-on-horizen-zen-being-a-privacy-coin-9a1749be3543)

What this reinforces in my mind is that the only good privacy projects are going to be community driven, grass roots efforts, like Monero.  We see in the case of ZEN, a project that was initially very privacy focused, a weakness of will when push comes to shove.  Their central leadership realizes it has responsibility to maximize the value of thier coin so they can continue to pay a troupe of marketeers and developers, and they just caved in when their coin was delisted.  

I just wanted to reflect on this and help people embrace the idea that the community nature of the project is the key to its success (or likely any privacy project's success). If people want privacy, we need to do it ourselves as a community from the bottom up.  Anyone can join in and help out.  If you value privacy and aren't chasing after quick gains, this is the project to work on, donate to, and advocate for.  Forget about projects that are centralizing or organizing in such a way that will eventually only become an achilles heel.  Monero has the basic structure right.  This is how it needs to be done.  Let's keep building!  Thanks to all who have contributed so much already.

Strength in numbers!  Strength through community!"
