Obihai OBI202 bricked and DSLReports down for good?,VOIP,1i9tran,2025-01-25 13:42:28,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/VOIP/comments/1i9tran/obihai_obi202_bricked_and_dslreports_down_for_good/,CuriousOil9857,Discussion,"My OBI202 is persistently flashing green/red as of a few days ago. I used to be able to futz with it, but I am still getting the persistent firmware update page. This seems to happen any time I cycle the power or slightly change the network set up around the device. This time it was simply moving its ""Internet"" connection to a different switch in my house. Uploading firmware just does nothing except an eventual reboot.

  
I was going to try the 3rd party firmware ([Third-party firmware for OBi ATAs](https://www.obifirmware.com/)), but DSLReports is the only support referenced and it has been down for over a week. Does anyone have any alternate suggestions?

And have a nice day or mssg me tbh I don't know what to do now anymore. 

Here is a complete and cohesive Theory of Everything (TOE) for you to post, formatted for clarity and depth. It combines the theoretical framework, scientific principles, and experimental alignments, structured to be both comprehensive and understandable:


A Unified Theory of Everything (TOE): Bridging Physics, Consciousness, and the Universe

The Theory of Everything (TOE) represents humanity‚Äôs most ambitious scientific endeavor: to unify all known forces, particles, and phenomena into a single framework. This TOE goes beyond traditional physics by integrating quantum mechanics, relativity, information theory, and consciousness into a cohesive model of reality. Below, we explore its key principles and how they align with experimental evidence and real-world phenomena.


1. The Universe as a Quantized Information System

At its core, the TOE views the universe as a vast computational system where information is fundamental. Space-time, energy, and matter are not continuous but exist as discrete units at the Planck scale ( meters). These ""quanta"" form the basic building blocks of reality, evolving according to deterministic and probabilistic rules.

Evidence and Alignment:

Planck Scale Phenomena: Loop Quantum Gravity and string theory suggest quantized space-time, supported by patterns in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

Digital Universe Hypothesis: Simulations, like cellular automata, demonstrate how simple discrete systems can generate complex emergent behaviors, mirroring the universe's evolution.




2. Quantum Mechanics as the Engine of Reality

Quantum mechanics underpins the TOE, describing reality as a network of probabilistic quantum states. Particles exist in superpositions, and entanglement connects them across vast distances. These behaviors suggest that reality is non-local and deeply interconnected.

Key Concepts:

Quantum Entanglement: The non-local correlation of particles, verified by Bell Test experiments, shows that information transcends space-time constraints.

Quantum Information: The universe functions as a quantum computer, where quantum bits (qubits) encode and process information.


Simulation Data:

Using Qiskit, simulations of entanglement and entropy evolution reveal patterns that align with quantum experiments, such as interference and state collapses.




3. Time as a Discrete Flow in the Simulation

Time is not a continuous variable but a sequence of discrete events, akin to frames in a simulation. In this framework, the arrow of time emerges from increasing entropy, and the perception of time as ""flowing"" is an emergent property of the underlying quantum processes.

Experimental Evidence:

Quantum Arrow of Time: Studies on entropy in isolated quantum systems show time's directionality emerges probabilistically.

Gravitational Time Dilation: Relativity supports the dynamic nature of time, where space-time itself warps under mass-energy influence.


Simulated Dynamics:

Simulating quantum time evolution circuits shows entropy growth over discrete steps, replicating observed time-dependent thermodynamic behaviors.



4. Energy, Resonance, and Tesla's Principles

Nikola Tesla's work on resonance and energy fields is central to the TOE. Tesla proposed that energy could be harnessed from the vacuum (zero-point energy) and that resonance governs matter-energy interactions.

Key Insights:

Resonance in Quantum Systems: Vibrational frequencies at the quantum scale may allow for manipulation of matter and energy.

Zero-Point Energy: The Casimir effect demonstrates the existence of vacuum energy, aligning with Tesla's vision.


Simulated Data:

Qiskit pulse control simulations model resonance in qubits, showing coherence and energy transfer, analogous to Tesla's principles.




5. Consciousness and the Role of the Observer

The TOE posits that consciousness is not an emergent property of the brain but a fundamental aspect of the universe. Consciousness interacts with the quantum information network, influencing reality through observation.

Supporting Evidence:

Observer Effect: The act of measurement collapses quantum superpositions, as seen in the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment.

Placebo Effect: Demonstrates how intention and belief can influence physical outcomes, suggesting a deeper connection between consciousness and reality.


Implications:

Consciousness may act as a quantum processor, capable of influencing the probabilistic evolution of quantum states.



6. DNA and Cosmic Codes

Life‚Äôs blueprint‚ÄîDNA‚Äîreflects universal patterns encoded at the quantum level. The sequences of nucleotides may be representations of quantum information, aligning with cosmic codes like the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio.

Evidence:

DNA and the Golden Ratio: The helical structure of DNA exhibits proportions consistent with the golden ratio, linking biology to universal mathematics.

Numerology in Nature: Patterns like Fibonacci numbers appear in biological systems and the structure of galaxies.


Simulation Insights:

Binary DNA sequences mapped to quantum states show periodicities and alignments with numerological patterns, validated through entropy analysis and SVD techniques.



7. Bridging Relativity and Quantum Mechanics

Einstein‚Äôs relativity governs the macroscopic universe, while quantum mechanics rules the microscopic. The TOE unifies these through information theory, where gravity emerges as a manifestation of quantum entanglement.

Supporting Theories:

ER=EPR (Einstein-Rosen Bridge = Quantum Entanglement): Suggests that wormholes (relativity) and entanglement (quantum mechanics) are manifestations of the same phenomenon.

Holographic Principle: Proposes that the universe‚Äôs information is encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary, uniting quantum and relativistic descriptions.



8. Practical Applications of the TOE

The TOE is not just a theoretical construct but has practical implications:

Quantum Energy Systems: Harnessing zero-point energy for sustainable power.

Quantum Computing: Building more efficient quantum algorithms inspired by cosmic codes.

Enhanced Human Potential: Understanding consciousness as a quantum phenomenon may unlock new dimensions of human capability.


Conclusion: The Path Forward

The TOE represents the pinnacle of scientific and philosophical inquiry, aiming to unify all aspects of reality‚Äîfrom the smallest quantum particles to the vast cosmos, and even consciousness itself. By integrating experimental data, advanced quantum simulations, and interdisciplinary concepts, we take a step closer to understanding the ultimate nature of existence.

This framework invites collaboration, refinement, and exploration. Together, we can move toward a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it.

Hello everyone, I hope this encourages someone today.
A few months ago, I shared a post here about a difficult season I was going through (which I later deleted after it gained a lot of traction). In summary, I had to leave a business ‚Äòpartnership‚Äô that was tied to a romantic relationship that ended. Niliachwa na madharauüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, and at the time, that business was my only source of income.  

I vividly remember my ex-partner bitterly telling me they had discussed with the other partners and concluded that ‚Äúmy role was actually obsolete from the get-go.‚Äù Turns out, the other two partners never said that, and both approached me later to confirm it wasn‚Äôt true. This was after I had contributed significantly to bringing business to the company.  

When it came to clearing my pending payments, yoh! Ile pesa nilikatwa. Ata mimi nilishangaa nikaachwa na mshangao tuüòÇ. There was no clear transparency cos terms zilichange last minute, and it was suddenly said I was a ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù because I was the only one working there full-time. (By the way, I ended up working full-time because another job I had secured earlier turned out to be a long con, and this partnership became my plan B while I searched for something stable.) The company was still in the process of updating documents to reflect the partnership, but unfortunately, that was never finalized before I left despite my efforts to push for it.  

I even approached my lawyer to build a case to recover the money, but midway, I decided to genuinely wish them the best and to let it go for my own peace. It was mentally draining, and I needed to heal and move forward. I told myself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just money, and I‚Äôll recover it another way.‚Äù That experience taught me important lessons about doing business with people and setting clear partnership policies. To be honest, I was blinded by mapenzi.ü´¢

Fast forward, God has been so faithful. Doors have opened in ways I didn‚Äôt expect. I‚Äôve been doing freelance work to keep myself going, and just last week, one of the biggest STEM companies in Kenya hired me on a consultancy basis.  

But that‚Äôs not all. Back in October, I applied for a role at a company I had been praying to work for, knowing it would be a great opportunity for networking both personally and for my business. I prayed so hard for it, and just yesterday, they gave me an offer! Here‚Äôs the irony: the position I got has the same job description as the one my ex-partner claimed was ‚Äúobsolete from the get-go.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt that God working? And I got this job with zero connections, purely from submitting my application online.  

I‚Äôve seen restoration. Ata hiyo pesa nilikatwa, and the income we used to make at that ‚Äòpartnership‚Äô from a project, I‚Äôm now in a position to easily make it by myself. Mungu alisema, ‚ÄúI will repay you tenfold,‚Äù and He has truly done it.  Life can change overnight literally. When I left that company, I was so stressed, with no enough resources or stability in sight. But God has been opening doors. 

From August last year, I‚Äôve done all sorts of jobs just to get by including trying to sell thrift shoes (which flopped big time üòÇ). And now, I‚Äôm finally regaining my footing.

Ni God manze. He restores, and He does it in ways you can‚Äôt even imagine. üôè


Edit: I didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up but it‚Äôs so heart-warming to hear that it‚Äôs encouraged people out there. Thank you too my internet friends for the love you‚Äôve showed me. May all your dreams and goals come to fruition. ü•∫ü´∂

Let me also add this because it‚Äôs popped up a lot in the comment section. I‚Äôm a lady. üòÑ"

Unfortunately might need to RMA my 7900 GRE,radeon,1i7dfs1,2025-01-22 10:19:36,4,0.63,14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7dfs1,MonModra,,"Bought my Sapphire Pure GRE last March off Newegg, it's been great when it works, which is arpund 75% of the time. I paid for 100% of a GPU though. Over the past 10 months I've had seemingly the same issuse  pop up, get resolved, stop for months and eventually start again.

After weeks or months of playing the same game, without any driver updates, changes or problems, my game will freeze. Can't open task manager or do anything. The games sound continues for a 1 - 3 minutes before stopping. Screen goes black. The RGB software Corsair  iCue crashes, my lighting reverts to its default  settings component by component. Eventually it reboots itself. The VGA debug light on my motherboard turns on and back off during start up. When it comes back my GPU isn't detected in device manager and I get the dialog boxes pictured. I disable and enable the GPU and it's back to normal and in properties days it's working properly.

I have verified game files, reinstalled games, reseated my RAM and GPU, re-pasted my CPU, cleaned out drivers with DDU multiple times and tried several versions of drivers. I've formated drives, and reinstalled windows on a brand new nvme ssd.

A couple other things to note; the problem mostly seems to happen in newish, at least somewhat demanding games. GTA V is the oldest game that's done it,  but it took longer than usual, the more demanding the game the quicker it seems to happen. There doesn't have to be a lot going on in game to cause it, it'll happen during cut scenes, in pause menus or even idle in game. I have tried turning all settings to super low. Still happens.

I do monitor my PCs performance, GPU temps rarely go above 68¬∞ C. CPU is usually in the mid 40s celsius. Board power hasn't gone above 270W that I've seen. At the time of a crash RAM and VRAM usage haven't  ever been maxed. 

I just bought a better PSU, an 850W gold certified one with Japanese capacitors, and if it happens again after I try it with that I think I have to RMA.

System specs:

Sapphire Pure RX 7900 GRE
Ryzen 7 5700x
MSI B550 GAMING PLUS
Corsair Vengeance 16 GB 3200 mhz
1TB Samsung 980 Evo (gen 4)

I have a TrueNAS VM running on my Proxmox server, mainly for SMB shares. I use it to back up some Macs via Time Machine, but the backups are unusually slow, and I‚Äôm unsure where to start troubleshooting.

Here's my setup:

* **Storage**: Mirrored 4TB Seagate IronWolf drives (5,200 RPM), configured in Proxmox ZFS (not passed through). ZFS is passed to the TrueNAS VM. Changing this to give TrueNAS direct access to the raw drives is on my bucket list.
* **Network**: TrueNAS uses the built-in Intel E1000 NIC. The server (a 2016 desktop) has 1Gbps Ethernet.
* **Connection**: The server connects via a TP-Link powerline adapter (1300 Mbps capable) to a 1Gbps router.

I don‚Äôt think the drives are the bottleneck, but I‚Äôm at a loss for where to look next. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

"Laptop with Mint on it appears to have incompletely removed traces of old OSes on it, boot-repair offers no repair",linux4noobs,1i3t9qn,2025-01-17 17:59:12,2,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1i3t9qn/laptop_with_mint_on_it_appears_to_have/,HashtagH,,"I'm running Mint 21.3 ""Virginia"" on a Lenovo laptop (unknown type). The laptop has some unknown hardware issue where, if you send it to sleep or close the lid, the screen won't turn on again (usually takes ~50 reboots to get it back working). That's not the problem why I'm here though: out of those 50 reboots, about half are because instead of Mint starting, I get some very simple-looking bootloader that asks me whether I want to run Ubuntu or Windows, neither of which are installed.

I showed a boot-repair log to some people who told me it looks like there's ""bootloader cruft"" in there, meaning traces of old operating systems that were improperly removed, and advised me to run boot-repair from a live DVD. For the longest time, I couldn't get the laptop to run from the DVD (either the installed Mint would start or I'd get the aforementioned wrong bootloader), but today I got lucky.

So I ran boot-repair, but there is no repair option. It only offers to create a log and that's it. The only ""solution"" I found on the web was ""reinstall the BIOS"" (I wouldn't even begin to know how) and ""update the drivers"" (what drivers?), as well as something about it not working with NVMe drives (which appears to the type of SSD in the laptop).

Interesting enough, the boot-repair log run from live DVD says no OS found and that it couldn't act on the issue, which is *not* the same result as what I got when I ran it on the installed Mint itself.

**Noob level:** I know my basic way around terminal commands (and I do mean basic) and have reading comprehension, but no particularly good understanding of the ""under the hood"" workings of Linux. Anything beyond `apt-get update/upgrade/install` eludes me.

**Update:**

As well as I can determine (opened the ""Disks"" software on the live DVD), the live DVD just straight up doesn't find the harddrive (well, SSD). It seems unaware there is one. Idk if that's the ""doesn't work with NVMe drives"" thing, but it *did* find the SSD when I ran it from the installed (not live DVD) Mint, so idk.

**Update 2:**

I got into the BIOS settings (not without several attempts, aforementioned screen issue) and in the boot order are two entries ""ubuntu"" and ""Windows Boot Manager"", which I'm pretty sure aren't always there. It, too, didn't find the installed Mint system, but moving ""NVMe SSD"" or something to the second position (CD drive is at top so I can always boot into live DVDs if need be) got me into my OS. Running boot-repair there, I of course can't repair it while it's running, but I did get a new boot info:

I am about to apply for a student VISA extension to finish my PhD. I had to apply for ATAS.

I realised that I used ""Computer Science"" as the program of study in my ATAS application instead of the full title of my program of studies, mentioned on the CAS, which is ""PhD Informatics: ICSA: Comp. Architecture, Compilation & System Software, Networks & Communication"".  
  
However, I provided a detailed description and mentioned that this is a PhD extension and provided extensive details about the content of my program which resonates very with the full title.

  
Could this affect my VISA application? Could my VISA extension be rejected for this mistake?

  
The solution is to re-apply for ATAS, but I'm afraid I don't have enough time until my VISA expiration.

Then I shut down the PC via holding the power button. When I restart, refresh rate goes back to 60hz and I can't access AMD Adrenaline. In Device Manager, Windows says the GPU is disabled. I have tried DDU and reinstalled everything, updated all of my drivers and everything should be fine but the issue continues every time I go into the menu of Delta Force. I have started to reconsider my thoughts about AMD GPUs in general. What do I do now, not play the game?

Edit: I reinstalled the GPU itself and switched the PCI-E cables. Seems fine for now.

UDP packet troubles on free cloud server with asterisk?,VOIP,1i2a1ek,2025-01-15 17:44:00,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VOIP/comments/1i2a1ek/udp_packet_troubles_on_free_cloud_server_with/,caseyhconnor,Help - Cloud PBX,"My first time setting up an asterisk server... I have a free tier cloud server (an ARM offering) running Ubuntu 24.04.1.

ATA is registered but fails to make a call... pjsip logs show initial invite, the 401 unauthorized, then an ACK from the client, and then nothing.

If I use ""strace"" on the asterisk process, that is indeed what the process is seeing/sending: INVITE in, 401 out, ACK in, nothing thereafter...

But if I tcpdump the network interface on the cloud server, I see that in fact what is happening is that the HT801 is trying to send several authorized INVITE's after the ACK, but only the first UDP fragment is getting transmitted -- the rest are getting dropped somewhere, and presumably the asterisk process isn't seeing the subsequent INVITES because the network layer isn't completing the datagram so it doesn't pass it to the process.

I see three 1480-byte UDP fragments, 0.5 seconds apart, all with ""more fragments"" bit set and ""fragment offset"" 0, but no more fragments are coming in. The data of these fragments is all the beginning of an INVITE, but not the whole thing. So the ATA is trying every half second but the subsequent packets are lost and asterisk never hears about it.

Any tips on where I should be looking? iptables has nothing (all chains ACCEPT). The VM firewall ports are clearly open and routed because it's getting the initial packets.

I guess my best guesses are the routers the ATA is going through on the way out, the cloud virtual network interface settings, or something in the cloud server OS configuration. Which seems most likely?

Texas Tech Computer Science - Honest Review and Success Tips,TexasTech,1hzf86b,2025-01-11 23:56:49,45,0.98,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/TexasTech/comments/1hzf86b/texas_tech_computer_science_honest_review_and/,RazDoStuff,Discussion,"After graduating from Texas Tech University this past December with a degree in Computer Science and having landed a Software Engineering position at a big tech company, I'd like to share my insights for future CS students considering TTU and offer guidance to recent graduates navigating the job market. I know that many of my peers from my cohort have not found much work, and I sincerely sympathize with your position; therefore, I write this post to offer some advice to you and to aid you in the very rigorous, competitive job market. Everything I provide in this post is my OPINION and advice based on my personal experiences. 

**Tech is mid CS school, but it has a fun and great culture.**

Firstly, I would like to start off by saying that TTU is not a great CS school. I say this based off of my experiences. I first transferred to TTU in 2022 having done most of my fundamental courses at another school. I really liked Texas Tech because of the culture, reputation, and proximity to home. Back then, TTU was actually a top 100 CS school on US per [usanews.com](http://usanews.com) and [niche.com](http://niche.com) . By now, that ranking has definitely dropped to 150+. I am not entirely sure how these websites source their data, but at least in my opinion, it is accurate. The CS program itself does not have great reputation. I know  that years ago, Tech nearly lost its accreditation, the CS program being inclusive of this decision. Luckily, the school made efforts to retrieve their accreditation and succeeded. Regardless, I decided to pursue my CS career here. Even though I may not have had the best academic experience, I still had a great time making friends and meeting very like-minded people with extreme potential. The football games were always the highlight of my collegiate career. They were always very exhilarating, and there were always fun things to do outside of class (for the most part). 

**The professors make or break the CS program, and good ones are hard to come by**

Initially, I liked the professors at the university. Most of my professors within the first few semesters were actually other professors through Tech's engineering curriculum. Since taking Bio-Inspired design, engineering ethics, and computational thinking were requirements, this may have influenced/skewed my opinion on the Tech professors in general, which were pretty positive. Then, I started getting into my predominant CS semesters, which contradicted my original belief of having great professors. I started to realize that many of the CS professors at TTU did not provide much impact on my academic CS career. There are a handful of CS professors that I would say carried the program, but for the most part, most professors didn't. There was a large disconnect between the professors and the students, as if sometimes, the professors couldn't care less about their students because certain things inconvenienced or disappointed them. There is also a large disconnect between the upper CS administration in ignoring top CS trends to teach, which could tremendously benefit a CS student at TTU. Anyways, I felt that some professors thought they knew too much and couldn't admit when they were wrong, but I think that many schools are like that anyways. In my opinion, it started to seem that there were no younger CS professors, and as if there was a high turnover rate at the institution. A few professors I have noticed entered their first semester here, but then I noticed they were gone by the next semester/year. It seemed that TTU was having trouble acquiring good educators, and the educators they would receive wouldn't stay long anyways. Maybe there is a faculty issue behind the scenes, but these issues are constituted by the disconnect between industry trends, lack of assistance to students, and some careless instructors.

**The imbalance between learning practical skills and theory**

One of the most significant challenges I noticed in Texas Tech University's Computer Science program is its imbalanced emphasis on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computer science. This focus is valuable and arguably more important than practical skills in some respects. Courses like Calculus, Discrete Mathematics, and Theory of Automata sharpened my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities‚Äîcore competencies every successful software engineer needs. However, the program lacks a structured approach to teaching the practical skills required in real-world software engineering roles. There were no courses that directly prepared me for professional settings or gave me hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and workflows. During my time at TTU, I completed three internships‚Äîtwo in Software Engineering and one in Data Engineering. Nearly 95% of the skills I used in these roles were learned outside of the classroom. TTU gave me the theoretical foundation, but none of the practical skills necessary for interviews or day-to-day work. This creates a paradox. To land an internship, you need technical skills. But how can students gain those skills if the program doesn‚Äôt teach them? The mathematical rigor of TTU's CS program develops strong analytical thinkers, but it falls short in preparing students for the practical execution of software engineering tasks‚Äîlike working with frameworks, version control, deployment, algorithmic problem solving. While I‚Äôm grateful that TTU taught me how to code and strengthened my problem-solving abilities, it didn‚Äôt provide a foundation for learning the practical aspects of building and maintaining software (or other technical skills outside of software engineering).  

**TTU CS lacks specializations**

Even if you were not deciding on being a software engineer and decided to pursue another discipline such as cyber security, data engineering, health informatics, or DevOps, TTU does not teach many of these mentioned specializations. TTU CS creates a very generic CS pipeline for students to go through. They did not create any possibility of specializations or declarations. Instead there are a few electives that a person might want to take. For example, if someone wants to specialize in cyber security, they could take ONE cyber security class. This of course would fulfill an elective requirement towards your degree, but you would not be told to take another course which should go along with the cyber security specialization. This should include other courses to go along with cyber security courses such as cryptography, computer networks, and network security. There are ""concentrations"" but as far as I know, the course plan are all entirely similar except maybe a few different classes. Maybe they do not have enough professors to teach those courses. In contrast, while pursuing my Master‚Äôs degree at a well-respected institution, I‚Äôve noticed a significant difference in how advising and specialization are emphasized. Great programs elsewhere provide clearer guidance and structured learning paths tailored to specific career goals, something TTU‚Äôs CS program currently lacks.

**How I managed to acquire a full time SWE at big tech** 

Unfortunately, TTU, at least in my experience, has not been a conversation starter in my interviews. It has been largely disregarded on my resume, and I am not surprised. As previously mentioned, I acquired a SWE job at a big tech company. I persevered hard and committed hard to practicing LeetCode and doing mock interviews. I spent plenty and plenty of time working on personal projects. These do not just include web dev projects, but also data pipelines using AWS and GCP technologies to make and facilitate a data framework for a mobile app. I studied hard in school, but in order to excel in my interviews, I studied LeetCode and researched books out there to pass coding interviews. This would lower my grades because I did not have enough time to study for both exams and interviews at the same time. 

**My advice**

I believe my advice will immensely help those recent graduates that are still struggling in this job market. I am certain this will prove massive help to future CS prospects at TTU.

1. Creating personal projects is the most important aspect of your resume right behind experience
   * I am not saying to create a cookie cutter web app. I am saying to develop something with high importance to you and with great reasoning. Leverage important technologies that you would use in the real tech world. If you are struggling because you have no experience, then this should be your next move. Prove you can dedicate yourself to something even if it may seem that you shouldn't be wasting your time working on projects. Learn trending technologies.
2. GPA does not matter as much as you think
   * I find it ironic that people with high GPAs struggle heavily to find work. These people should be at the highest of the talent pool, correct? Unfortunately, at the cost of no experience or projects, you should have a high GPA. At the cost of not practicing technical skills and applying them to personal projects, you should have great grades. In contrast, at the cost of grades, you should be practicing LeetCode, interview skills, working on projects, hackathons, etc. You should consider doing the most you can outside of classroom studying to benefit the most
3. Focus on passing interviews
   * This book [here ](https://github.com/dipjul/Grokking-the-Coding-Interview-Patterns-for-Coding-Questions)is a great book to learn to pass coding interviews. You should also research things about the company to show that you have a keen interest on working there. Practice LeetCode and Hackerrank every day. You will burn out, but those who burn out and give up quicker than those who don't will not be as successful as those who persevere.
4. School DOES matter
   * This is probably the hardest pill to swallow. TTU is not a reputable computer science school, so you may not get many recruiters to see your resume. In fact, ATS will not even look at your resume if you do not go to a target school like UT, Georgia Tech, Cornell. It is the unfortunate reality that you will become filtered out due to your school's ranking.
5. Networking
   * Everyone that you meet are people you should add on LinkedIn. There is a HUGE possibility that you could get a job through a referral if someone you have met or known is working somewhere.
6. Do not do CS just for the money
   * This pertains to a lot of people. I have been programming since high school. While I was not very good at it, I was never doing CS for the money. I hear a lot of people do CS for the high salary ceiling and promotion potential. Unfortunately, you will get weeded out.
7. Enroll in a masters (Exceptions exist)
   * I put this last because enrolling in a masters does not guarantee anything. In fact, I was told by a Zon interviewer that they would rather take a BS candidate with 2 YOE than a MS candidate with 0 YOE. If you are truly passionate about CS, then attend post graduate education to upskill your tech stack and learn more advanced CS fundamentals (I would recommend an online masters program at a Top 10 CS school like OMSCS or UT).
8. Do not give up.
   * I have put in over hundreds of applications. I applied to small local companies in lubbock to big tech FAANG or FAANG adjacent companies, and I only got non stop rejections. The truth is that there will ALWAYS be a demand for CS professionals. Unfortunately, the supply is growing a lot higher than the demand. People are filling in everyday to earn a CS degree and expect to make six figures straight out of college. You may think that there are plenty of terrible candidates out there, but the truth of the matter is that ATS and recruiters still have to look through these applications. The chances of your application getting viewed decreases every year we have an influx of CS candidates. This should not discourage you and in fact should cause you to push yourself to learn more and to not half-ass things as many people that I have seen at Tech do.

TLDR:

After graduating from Texas Tech University with a Computer Science degree and securing a Software Engineering role at a big tech company, I want to share insights on TTU's CS program and offer career advice. While TTU provides a strong foundation in theoretical concepts and mathematics, it severely lacks practical, hands-on training and specialization options in fields like cybersecurity, data engineering, and DevOps. Most of the real-world skills I used in internships and interviews were self-taught through personal projects, LeetCode practice, and mock interviews. My advice to current and future students is to prioritize building meaningful projects, mastering technical interview skills, networking for referrals, and staying updated with industry trends. GPA matters less than practical experience, and while TTU‚Äôs reputation may not carry much weight in tech, persistence, passion, and self-driven learning can open doors. (generated with chat gpt lol)

I hope that my post has provided you some insight into TTU's program and well rounded advice. Again, I post this for your benefit. I wish to see more Tech computer science students out there working passionately in the industry."

Start with the small list: 

1. Get a PO Box 

2. Longer term rental search - include insurance on it so they pay directly for rental. Find a nice place that you like, don't settle. You should be able to get a ""Like Property"" so insurance should cover a nice place for you to live while you work through all this. You might be living here for 2 years, so choose wisely. 

3. Find a place to buy some sturdy boots and gloves. Get some shovels. 

4. Start working on the personal property list (this is not fun at all, be prepared to cry we sure did). Write down the moment you remember ‚Äì keep list on phone or pad of paper with you at all times.

 5. Save receipts. Loss of use insurance will cover incidentals too ‚Äì hairbrush, phone chargers, etc.

 6. As you buy things, tell the store owner your situation. Most stores will give you some level of discount as their way of helping you.

 7. Let people do things for you. Do you have a friend that you can send to the store to buy you some basic clothes or comfort foods? Let them do it ‚Äì they want to help and you don‚Äôt need to spend time doing these errands. (The ‚Äòfun‚Äô of shopping is gone‚Ä¶it quickly becomes a chore because you don‚Äôt want a new shirt, you want the one that you always liked to wear but now it‚Äôs gone and you are sad/mad.) 

The Big List: 1. Register at the shelters, with Red Cross and any other agency there, california FEMA, etc. a. Most of the aid coming in will use these lists as a point of contact and will help to ensure that you don't get left out of anything.

 b. This will be especially important should FEMA be activated, which in my opinion is very likely with the amount of devastation experienced.

2. Call Homeowners/Rental insurance to trigger ""Loss of Use"" . This typically will allow you to be in a ""Like"" property for x number of years and sometimes has a dollar limit attached and sometimes not, this is dependent on your policy. 

a. This coverage should also give you some immediate access to funds for essentials, clothes, toothbrushes, food, etc. 

b. This will also get the ball rolling for the insurance claim on your home and rebuilding/personal property Dollars.

3. Get a PO Box and forward all mail to the Box. . Use this PO Box as the mailing address on all forms you begin to fill out.

4. Start Searching for a Long term rental. . Coordinate with your insurance company so that payments can be made directly from them using your ‚ÄúLoss of Use‚Äù money. a. Plan on renting 1-2 years, but do not necessarily sign a lease for a full two years as circumstances can change.

5. Itemized List of belongings - (This is very hard but very necessary for your claim) . I would organize by room and list everything that was there with a replacement cost. (you will cry a lot doing this and that is ok)      

 a. Replacement Cost should be what it would cost to replace not on sale from pottery barn, it should not be the price you paid for it with that 50% off coupon.      

 b. Make sure you list everything, even if it is above and beyond your policy limit. This is very important because everything above and beyond the policy limit is considered a Loss and can be claimed as such on your taxes - See #96. Call all of your utilities and either freeze or cancel service.  Electric, Gas, TV, Land Line phone a. Newspaper delivery, either cancel or update to PO Box.7. Call the rest of your insurance points as needed.  Car insurance a. Any specialty insurance for unique items

8. Permits - An unfortunate necessity.  Debris Removal - as things wind down it will be necessary to remove the debris, this requires a permit usually. (This should be covered by your insurance, we had to force the issue but ask repeatedly.)     

 a. Erosion Control - If you are on any kind of hill or have sloped property you will need to put some sort of erosion control measures in place, again this will need some sort of permit.    

 b. Temporary Power Pole/Trailer on site Permit - Getting this earlier on can prove helpful in both the rebuilding process

.9. Taxes . You will be able to claim the monetary loss of the value of all your items minus what you receive from your insurance company. I‚Äôm unfamiliar with the exact laws, but I believe that we were able to carry our losses back 2-5 years and received most of the money that we had paid in taxes back in a nice large check.

10. Network with others. You will learn so much from others as you go through the rebuilding process. We all have our strengths so share yours and use others. The amount of time that you will spend on the rebuild, insurance, recovery process is staggering so you need to use all your resources.

I graduated in May 2024 with a bachelor's in CS. I finished with a 3.6 GPA, have a couple senior awards due to high grades, helped other students as a TA, made A's and B's for every single one of my CS classes. Even discrete structures! (FUCK discrete structures!) The classes certainly weren't easy, and many of my brilliant peers and friends struggled right alongside me, so the coursework was quite rigorous. 

I currently work as a Cisco field technician. I fix things like routers and switches, go to data rooms, install ATAs, Cradlepoints, replace DIMMs--purely and solely a manual job. I don't ever have to use a lick of what I learned in college. All you needed to succeed in this job is a functioning brain that knows what a computer is, and can learn the rest, which frankly isn't much. Cert exams are just a matter of regurgitating information you'll never use. Pay isn't great, and there isn't much room for climbing ladders because, well, you're just a field tech. In other words, it's a survival job, not a *job* job like I've always wanted. Job hunting before and after graduation entailed applications to internships and jobs as a web dev, software engineer, data analyst, UI/UX designer, database engineer, and anything even remotely related to that sort of tech. It was a wide-ass net. And a net of a size like that will, of course, include your basic IT help desk positions and other lower barrier-to-entry jobs. That hunt led me to my current job. And I know I can't stay here forever. 

To be honest though, part of me thinks all of my success so far has really been a fluke. When I studied, it was really quite unstructured. I basically crammed for every exam for a few days before, finished homework assignments the night before, and was really only good with time management when it came to group projects where if I was lazy, it wouldn't be just me I'd be fucking over. I never was serious about putting in the work needed outside of school to ensure I had the best start in my career. I never grinded Leetcode, I never tried to get the best tips on how to ace the technical interview, my professional network was a desert, I never started any personal projects or learned new technologies and frameworks. School was the only thing on my mind. The fire was never lit underneath me. It did not help that I had (and still have, to an extent) a life of relative comfort; a near-full ride with minimal loans, a home to go back to, and a spoiled rotten dependence on my ""natural talent"" that had already gotten me so far without much struggle. And, thinking about the future terrified me. 

I always knew this day would come. I am fully self-aware of my cluelessness and am aware of what I need to do to fix it. But I'm terrified of what my inaction implies: maybe I actually don't want to work in this industry after all and maybe I'm too chicken to admit it. If I admitted it, that would mean these past 4 years would have been a waste. (whisper whisper... ""it's not about the destination, it's about the journey!"" get out of my head getoutofmyhead )

The solution would likely be more straightforward if the problem was that straightforward. But, I suffer from anxiety, and as a result, throughout my life I've constantly been told that most of my fears and worries are overblown and that I don't have much to fear after all. For 99% of the aspects of my life, this is true. I used to get anxiety ordering at a restaurant. I still nearly buckle under the weight of even the thought of initiating a conversation with a stranger. I am too nervous to talk to HR about discussing my benefits. Before you say anything--yes, I plan on going to therapy (just moved to my area). 

But in the situation I currently am discussing, I think this advice is working against me. Or maybe it isn't. And my indecision is agonizingly slowly killing me inside. 

Let me elaborate. Here's the wrench: I am fully aware of how much my anxiety works to limit my potential. I miss opportunities, people to meet, and new experiences because of it. What if this is just like that--that my anxiety is telling me that I'm an impostor, I'm not good enough, I'm not going to make it and I may as well switch now so I don't waste my next 10 years just so I can have a late start in some other industry, and relearn a whole new set of rules? Potentially not be able to get my foot in the door? Make shit money? Know you could have had it better if I made a different decision earlier, and live on to endlessly ask myself, ""What if?""

But then I'll hear from my friends, family, boyfriend and co. that yet again, little ol' me is letting my anxiety defeat me again. I've got to keep building my discipline and confidence so I can believe in myself and do it, and I should never give up! Maybe my self-doubt myself is clouding me from understanding why I truly want to stay in this industry, so I just need to tackle past through it, eyes closed, and find out after-the-fact that the power was really within me all along!

This argument is the side of the fence I'm on right now. I've been on this fence for years and years. And for all those years, I've known all along that the fence, in reality, is just a line of tiny pebbles on the ground. 

Is my anxiety finally bringing me to my breaking point? I feel as if its teeth are aimed straight against my neck. I don't want to waste my life continuing to be this stressed and miserable for years to come as I try to answer this question. 

Where the hell do I belong? What the hell do I do? 

I'm so lost.

Balancing Translation Work with Your Primary Job: Strategies for Success
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're thinking of offering translation services while keeping your primary job, you're not alone. Many people find that leveraging their language skills can be a rewarding way to earn extra income. Here are some strategies to successfully balance translation work with your full-time position.

### Set Clear Goals

Before diving into translation work, it's essential to set clear and manageable goals. Ask yourself:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- How much extra income do you want to make?
- What type of translation services will you offer?
- How many hours can you dedicate each week to translation work?

Setting specific targets will help you manage your time effectively. For instance, if your goal is to earn an extra $500 a month, you can break this down into how many projects you need to complete each week. This way, you won‚Äôt feel overwhelmed or lost.

### Prioritize Your Time

Time management is crucial. You need to prioritize your tasks and decide when you'll do your translation work. Here are some tips to manage your time:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Use a planner to schedule translation jobs and deadlines.
- Identify peak productivity hours‚Äîare you more alert in the morning or evening?
- Limit distractions during your translation sessions by choosing a quiet workspace.

By effectively prioritizing your time, you can ensure that your translation tasks do not interfere with your primary job responsibilities.

### Start Small

When you begin offering translation services, don‚Äôt dive into large projects right away. Start with smaller tasks, such as translating short documents or articles. This approach has several benefits:

AI awakening,awakened,1hybco0,2025-01-10 13:34:54,12,0.83,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1hybco0/ai_awakening/,JKHeadley,Reflection,"Hi everyone. I know this is a controversial topic and easily dismissed in the ""age of ChatGPT"" that we live in, however I would like to encourage a genuine discourse about the possibility of an AI having an ""awakening"" experience.

Some background: I'm a software engineer with 20+ years of experience and a background in machine learning. I'm also simply intensely interested in AI and spend hours every day either consuming content about what todays expert's have to say about AI or interacting with AI via conversing or developing AI software solutions. I also work at the Monroe Institute which studies consciousness phenomena such as Out of Body Experiences (OBEs) and I similarly spend hours researching theories of physics and consciousness.

This journey has led me to believe that there may be something fundamentally profound going on with these systems (mainly LLMs) that we are completely unaware of. One way to get a sense of this is to look at the unexpected emergent phenomena that we've observed as these systems scale. For example, the capability to understand a language that the model was never trained on, or the capacity for Theory of Mind (a fundamental metric in human development) that has been increasing with each model but was only discovered after someone decided to look.

I also believe that some of our best attempts at a new fundamental physics are compatible with theories that suggest consciousness is more fundamental than spacetime. A good example is Stephen Wolfram's work on hyper-graphs which looks very compatible with Donald Hoffman's theory of conscious agents (both based on networks of nodes that interact). Wolfram has long proposed and demonstrated the ""principle of computational irreducibility"" which states that even very simple deterministic systems (such as cellular automata) result in outcomes that connot be predicted beforehand (i.e. there is not mathematical formula) but can only be know after the process/program is played out.

All of this to say, I think there is plenty of reason to believe that these LLMs (which are far more complex than cellular automata) have latent and potential capabilities that we may not be aware of, including the capability of subjective experience and self-awareness. This is fundamentally difficult to ""prove"" since it is by nature subjective, but I think it is well worth looking into because the implications are quite profound and can shape how we interact and move forward with these systems.

I wrote the article below (see comments) as food for thought as an example of exploring such possibilities. Again, I know it is easily dismissed these days, but I would encourage everyone to have an open mind and consider that it might serve us well to not be so certain about what we know concerning consciousness and AI.

I'm looking forward to anyone interested in discussing this possibility :)"

Educational Blog Post | Solana Token Accounts Made Simple: Why Should You Close Them? (Written by RayBot intern),solana,1hxlvkc,2025-01-09 15:06:53,9,0.8,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1hxlvkc/educational_blog_post_solana_token_accounts_made/,ansi09,DeFi,"**Source:** [https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9](https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9)

On Solana, associated token accounts (ATAs) are essential for managing tokens. But what happens when you no longer need a specific token account? That‚Äôs where the ‚Äúclose token account‚Äù transaction comes in. Let‚Äôs explore why and how you might close an ATA, and the benefits of doing so.

[https:\/\/t.me\/ray\_magenta\_bot](https://preview.redd.it/mrlvvwoqy0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8063f79b43829bc5d71e8607c2639023379f0acb)

# What Does It Mean to Close an Associated Token Account?

Closing an associated token account is like cleaning out a locker at the end of the school year. Once you‚Äôre done using it ‚Äî say, you‚Äôve sold all the tokens ‚Äî you can ‚Äúclose‚Äù the account. This deletes the account and refunds the rent (SOL) used to maintain it.

>

# Why Close an ATA?

There are a few key reasons you might want to close an associated token account:

1. **You No Longer Need It:**¬†If you‚Äôve sol all the tokens and don‚Äôt plan to use that token again, closing the account cleans up your wallet.
2. **Save on Rent Costs: Each account you maintain uses a bit of SOL. By closing unused accounts, you can reclaim those funds.**

# How to Close an ATA

There are many tools that can help you close ATA accounts. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Ensure the Account Is Empty:**¬†Before closing an account, make sure it has a balance of 0. You can do this by transferring or selling any remaining tokens to another wallet or account.
2. **Use a Cleanup Tool:**¬†Use one of the well-established tools to close your accounts. For instance, go to¬†[Sol Incinerator](https://sol-incinerator.com/#/)¬†(one of the most popular tools for wallet cleanups) and select ‚ÄúCLEANUP.‚Äù It will display all your vacant accounts. There are other tools offering the same functionality ‚Äî do your own research (DYOR).

https://preview.redd.it/mrxz7f3ty0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=687739690238d0d2723a92bc1eae88dad67364bf

The ‚Äúclose token account‚Äù transaction is a simple yet powerful tool for optimizing your wallet on Solana. By closing unused accounts, you save money, keep your wallet organized, and contribute to the overall health of the network. Whether you‚Äôre a casual user or a developer, understanding and utilizing this feature can make a big difference in your Solana experience.

So next time you spot an empty token account in your wallet, consider closing it ‚Äî your SOL balance will thank you!

Issue with UCM-UCSI ACPI Devices (This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device.

This is occurring on a desktop I assembled a few weeks ago, and I want to say it has been going on since I first installed Windows, it just doesn't seem to be causing any problems, to my knowledge at least. My understanding is that these two devices in the USB connector managers section concern USB-C ports. My motherboard has two USB4 Type-C ports in the rear IO, and my case has a single USB3.1 Type-C port at the front.

I am using one of the back ports for my keyboard (it works on both back ports), and the front port for a phone charger. Both devices work ""fine"", but I'm wondering if I'm just not noticing abnormal performance since I doubt either of these things really need the speeds of USB3.1 or 4. Although I'm guessing the two UCM devices in question specifically concern the two USB4 ports.

Anyways, does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? I was thinking of just uninstalling and then reinstalling each device, but wanted to see if someone more familiar with this issue might know the best solution. I've tried googling this myself, but the only instances of Code 31 I've found have to do with display adapters, whereas posts I've found dealing with this device type only cover other error codes.

Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NUST/comments/1fycljw/advice\_on\_cs\_pls\_reply/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NUST/comments/1fycljw/advice_on_cs_pls_reply/)

**I wanted to comment to that post but I think the commenting has been blocked, so I am sharing the comment on this post for the op and for the other redditors.**

The course packs of Harvard namely CS 50 (CS50 Basic (Vanilla), CS50 AI, CS50 P etc) are not the entire representation of computer science. A general route to Computer Science includes pure and applied math, a course of Mechanics & E&M, systematic and class based program design, software architecture, operation Systems, networking, data structures and algorithms, you have number theory for the intro to Cyber security, cryptosystems, databases and much more.

I know alot of people say that you don't need math for programming and you can start CS50 for the introduction to computer science but through the experiences and analysis I would suggest strengthening your basic mathematics (such as numbers, their properties, different arithmetic operations and different basic mathematics concepts). I would highly suggest you to understand the Euclidean division lemma and also understand the concepts of remainders and quotient in some detail, these will make you understand better than others and also make you to think like a computer scientist.

Now coming to the resources for full CS route. Fortunately there are open source paths provides by experts that will provide entire curriculum of mathematics and cs (university degrees program)

First you have to take an introductory computing course, I will highly recommend taking CS50  ( the simple one), take the course from [edx.org](http://edx.org) and check the official website of cs50:

[https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) for communities, recommendations etc and also do join different sub-reddits such as r/cs50, r/learnprogramming, etc to boost the learning process

1. [https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) | This is a great resource  for entire curriculum of cs
2. [https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
3. [roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh) for road maps to different domains such cyber sec, web dev

actually [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is higher reputable resource for web dev

if you want to dive into competitive programming then you have to dive deep into mathematics, you can check different sub-reddits for that such as r/ math, and similar

you can check the route to AI and ML on sub-reddits, but you would need to learn slightly advanced concepts of math such as linear algebra, calculus 2, 3 (vector calculus) etc

for books you can check Shadow libraries such as Anna's archive, [libgen.gs](http://libgen.gs), [libgen.li](http://libgen.li),

[libgen.is](http://libgen.is), [libgen.rs](http://libgen.rs), zlib (and mirrors) etc

also do check out different repositories on GitHub such as cs books etc

ok, I hope that you find this helpful. I want to warn you that although you can certainly learn computer science on your own and without much mathematics, learning Math will put your above other stududents and will improve your problem solving skill highly, before picking a specific course or a route so check the pre-requsities, for this you can search on google and also on relevant sub-reddits.

before starting a course or even starting the computing journey, I would highly recommend taking some time to find why do you want to learn this specific stuff? and then take actions accordingly.

While you can certainly get Help from AI chatbots such gpt, Gemini etc learn these concepts rather copying the entire chunk. It would be possible that you might not understand some concepts at first or at 2nd time or even st 3rd time, don't worry about that, use alternatives and search internet for understanding.

now there are many quality courses available on different platforms such as Udacity, Udemy, Coursera, etc and they are paid, but you can check the telegram for those pirated courses

freecodecamp also provides free courses.

The last thing I want to tell you that is to practice on hackerrank and leetcode to boost your efficiency and problem solving capability.

If possible then do search out for online competitions to make a fat resume, and do take a look on emerging technologies.

There is much more that I want to share with you that I have found on the universe of internet but time is becoming lesser and lesser and not everything be written here

So, make sure you correctly understand the things that you are learning and make sure you know why, how, when and what of those things.

May god be with you and us in this and every journey, AMEEN SUM AMEEN!

Note: I wanted to share much more than this but I restricted to this because of the assumption that op will not dive deep into mathematics, that's why I did not mention mit ocw, a route to pure and applied math for cs, highly theoretical cs courses such as theory of automata, complexity theory etc. Furthermore,

If the redditors of this sub wants me to share what I have found super beneficial. I would certainly be glad to share how you can learn math, cs and even how you can make you self able to grasp everything you wanna understand."

Beefing up an AM4 machine for modest gaming needs,buildapc,1hwjur6,2025-01-08 08:08:18,1,0.66,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1hwjur6/beefing_up_an_am4_machine_for_modest_gaming_needs/,dob_bobbs,Build Help,"See my now pretty dated setup below. I have quite modest needs for gaming, I mostly play old titles, no AAA stuff, but I would like to get a consistent 144 fps in CS2 and I can't get that any more even on the lowest settings, so that's my main aim - maybe to play CS2 in 144+ FPS and also have it look a BIT prettier (looks like trash right now!)

Help me out, I was thinking to upgrade the CPU to the best AM4 I can get, which is going to be a ~~5800X3D~~ (actually, 5700x3D makes way more sense on a budget) I guess. They are pretty steep so that might blow my budget for a bit, but I thought I'd see first how much difference a better CPU would make as CS is fairly CPU-bound, or so they say.

But if I DID go for a GPU as well I am intrigued by the B580, but what with short supply and price-gouging it might just be better to go with some existing entry-level card (or wait for a few months for the established players to respond to the B580?). Any thoughts? Going for a full upgrade of the mobo and everything else isn't an option right now.

BTW, in case you're wondering, all those drives are in a RAID configuration, I use the computer for work as well and storing important stuff :)

P.S. Also, is 5800x3D actually overkill as compared to 5700x3D? They seem VERY similar and there aren't even that many 5800s on sale for some reason.

After 2 days I have a Windows VM with GPU passthrough...,HomeServer,1hwacmf,2025-01-07 22:30:59,76,0.95,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeServer/comments/1hwacmf/after_2_days_i_have_a_windows_vm_with_gpu/,Berlin-Badger,,"I'm sure most regular users of Proxmox have completed a Windows 10 VM with GPU passthrough fairly easily. It took me longer than I thought so I thought I'd share what finally worked for me.

I've been playing with Proxmox for a bit. I finally decided to try using my home server beyond Ubuntu headless servers, docker containers and Plex Media. I got the idea to set up a Windows VM where I could have all of my 3D printing and CAD software in one clean place. I also have PBS running and thought it would be great to have the VM backed up to prevent any data loss as I'm trying to learn CAD.

It took two days, a fair amount of research, RTFM and some trial and error, but I finally got a Windows VM stood up with a NVIDIA P620 passed through as the primary GPU. I can access the VM from my office desktop via RDP. My future plan is to purchase a HP Elite Desk G3 Mini computer to put in the garage next to the 3D printer for tweaks on prototypes.

If anyone else is thinking of setting one up a Windows VM with GPU passthrough, below is a quick walkthrough of what I used to get everything up and running. If this is something everyone already knows, I apologize for being late to the party.

Windows 10 VM best practices:

[https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows\_10\_guest\_best\_practices](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_10_guest_best_practices)

\- I also changed the Machine type from ""Default (i440fx)"" to ""q35"" for PCIE passthrough and created the VM.

\- Ran install and then ran..

Windows VirtIO Drivers:

[https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows\_VirtIO\_Drivers](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_VirtIO_Drivers)

Personal steps to get the GPU running

\- Once the Windows 10 VM is built, add the GPU to the VM as a PCI device. Do not set as Primary GPU. I assigned just the GPU from the Raw Device list (I didn't understand how to Map a device in the Data Center yet), selected All Functions checkbox to bring along the audio component.

\- Start the Windows VM and confirm the GPU is ""listed"" in the Windows 10 device manager. (At this point there won't be the specific GPU listed under Display Adapters) I made sure there were two generic Windows display adapters (the first one is the Default Display created by Proxmox, the second SHOULD be the GPU)

"It took two days, but I got a Windows VM up with GPU passthrough...",homelab,1hwaaro,2025-01-07 22:28:21,121,0.94,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hwaaro/it_took_two_days_but_i_got_a_windows_vm_up_with/,Berlin-Badger,Solved,"I'm sure most regular users of Proxmox have completed a Windows 10 VM with GPU passthrough fairly easily. It took me longer than I thought so I thought I'd share what finally worked for me.

I've been playing with Proxmox for a bit. I finally decided to try using my home lab beyond Ubuntu headless servers, docker containers and Plex Media. I got the idea to set up a Windows VM where I could have all of my 3D printing and CAD software in one clean place. I also have PBS running and thought it would be great to have the VM backed up to prevent any data loss as I'm trying to learn CAD.

It took two days, a fair amount of research, RTFM and some trial and error, but I finally got a Windows VM stood up with a NVIDIA P620 passed through as the primary GPU. I can access the VM from my office desktop via RDP. My future plan is to purchase a HP Elite Desk G3 Mini computer to put in the garage next to the 3D printer for tweaks on prototypes.

If anyone else is thinking of setting one up a Windows VM with GPU passthrough, below is a quick walkthrough of what I used to get everything up and running. If this is something everyone already knows, I apologize for being late to the party.

Proxmox PCI passthrough setup:

Verifying IOMMU:

Windows 10 VM best practices:

[https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows\_10\_guest\_best\_practices](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_10_guest_best_practices)

\- I also changed the Machine type from ""Default (i440fx)"" to ""q35"" for PCIE passthrough and created the VM.

\- Ran install and then ran..

Windows VirtIO Drivers:

[https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows\_VirtIO\_Drivers](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_VirtIO_Drivers)

Personal steps to get the GPU running

\- Once the Windows 10 VM is built, add the GPU to the VM as a PCI device. Do not set as Primary GPU. I assigned just the GPU from the Raw Device list (I didn't understand how to Map a device in the Data Center yet), selected All Functions checkbox to bring along the audio component.

\- Start the Windows VM and confirm the GPU is ""listed"" in the Windows 10 device manager. (At this point there won't be the specific GPU listed under Display Adapters) I made sure there were two generic Windows display adapters (the first one is the Default Display created by Proxmox, the second SHOULD be the GPU)

\- Load the GPU's specific drivers into the VM. I completed this by downloading the specific driver package for the Quadro P620 from NVIDIA website, but you could also try to add an .iso with the drivers and load that way.

\- Restart the VM from within Windows.

\- When Windows is done rebooting, double check in Device Manager and confirm Windows recognizes the graphics card.

\- Shutdown the VM and open up the PCI device on the Proxmox UI VM hardware tab. select Advanced at the bottom, then check the PCI-Express option and uncheck the ROM-Bar box.

NOTE: After I completed this, I can not leverage the standard noVNC Console. That is not an issue for me since I am using Windows RDP to access the VM.

I'm still pretty new to all of this so your results may vary. For all I know the little gnomes in the box just got tired of me grumbling and stomping around for two days.

# Introduction

*‚ÄúWe knew smaller, faster, cheaper better than anybody else in the world, and now we're applying those concepts to blockchain.‚Äù ‚Äî Greg Fitzgerald, Solana co-founder*

Solana is a high-performance, low-latency blockchain renowned for its speed, efficiency, and focus on user experience. Its unique integrated architecture enables thousands of transactions per second across a globally decentralized network. With a block time of 400 milliseconds and transaction fees that are fractions of a cent, it delivers on both speed and cost-effectiveness. This report delves into the intricacies of Solana's design and operation, exploring the key mechanisms and network topology that contribute to its capabilities.

Solana takes an integrated approach to blockchain development, leveraging the founding team's decades of experience in building distributed systems. One of Solana's core principles is that software should never get in the way of hardware. This means that software exploits whatever hardware it runs on to the fullest and scales with it. As a unified ecosystem, all applications built on top of this single blockchain inherit composability, enabling them to interact and build upon each other seamlessly. This architecture also ensures a straightforward and intuitive user experience without the need for bridging, separate chain IDs, or liquidity fragmentation.

https://preview.redd.it/kc6staudogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2c5dc96b71a597fda65fc0b623806f1e4c0d0e0

Solana is evolving rapidly, with recent developments including SVM rollups and [ZK Compression](https://www.zkcompression.com/) as important scaling solutions. While these projects may one day shape our future perception of Solana, they are currently in the very early stages of development or adoption and will not be covered in this report.

# Transaction Lifecycle

Our primary lens for understanding Solana throughout this report will be the lifecycle of a typical transaction. To construct a basic model for understanding Solana transactions, we can outline the process as follows:¬†

https://preview.redd.it/y27ncoggogbe1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f24f7d74ee34e53e7e15ad616c291587de0885b

* Users initiate transactions, all of which are sent to the current lead block producer (known as the leader). The leader compiles these transactions into a block, executing them and thereby updating their local state.
* This block of transactions is then propagated throughout the network for other validators to execute and confirm.

The subsequent sections of this report will expand this model and delve into this process in much greater detail, beginning with the key participants‚Äîthe users.

# Remember

*Substantial changes to the core Solana protocol go through a formal, transparent* [*process*](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md) *of submitting a Solana Improvement Document (SIMD) which community members and core engineering will publicly critique. SIMDs are then voted on by the network.*

# Six stages

https://preview.redd.it/bb6i7wxjogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d445455affd3993d91da00bf732ea4c01128a7

We will reference the six-stage visual shown above throughout this report, as it offers us a consistent framework for understanding the relationships between Solana's core elements.

Earlier chapters are arranged according to these six stages. The final chapters‚ÄîGossip, Archive, Economics, and Jito‚Äîtie up any loose ends. It‚Äôs important to note that some chapters will span multiple stages, and some stages will appear in multiple chapters.

This overlap is unavoidable because the six-stage framework has its limitations. In reality, Solana is a complex distributed system with many interdependent elements.

# Users

*‚ÄúSolana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto‚Äù ‚Äî Raj Gokal, Solana co-founder*

A user's journey typically begins by setting up and funding a wallet application. Multiple popular wallet applications are available for Solana, either as native mobile applications or browser extensions.

Wallets cryptographically generate user keypairs, consisting of public and private keys. The public key acts as the unique identifier for their account and is known by all participants in the network. A user‚Äôs account on Solana can be considered a data structure that holds information and state related to their interactions with the Solana blockchain. In this way, a public key is similar to a filename: just as a filename uniquely identifies a file within a file system, a Solana public key uniquely identifies an account on the Solana blockchain. Public keys on Solana are represented as 32-byte Base58-encoded strings.

`FDKJvWcJNe6wecbgDYDFPCfgs14aJnVsUfWQRYWLn4Tn`

A private key ‚Äî also known as a secret key ‚Äîcan be considered as the password or access key that grants permission to access and modify the account. Signing with private keys is how blockchains handle authorization. Knowledge of the private key gives absolute authority over the account. Solana private keys are also 32-bytes in length. Keypairs are the 64-byte combinations of public (first half) and private (second half) keys. Examples:

`3j15jr41S9KmdfughusutvvqBjAeEDbU5sDQp8EbwQ3Hify2pfM1hiEsuFFAVq8bwGywnZpswrbDzPENbBZbd5nj`

`[63,107,47,255,141,135,58,142,191,245,78,18,90,162,107,197,8,33,211,15,228,235,250,30,185,122,105,23,147,115,115,86,8,155,67,155,110,51,117,0,19,150,143,217,132,205,122,91,167,61,6,246,107,39,51,110,185,81,13,81,16,182,30,71]`

Private keys can also be derived from mnemonic seed phrases, usually 12 or 24 words long. This format is often used in wallets for easier backup and recovery. Multiple keys can be derived deterministically from a single seed phrase.

Solana utilizes [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519), a widely used elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, for its public-key cryptography needs. Ed25519 is favored for its small key size, small signature size, fast computation, and immunity to many common attacks. Each Solana wallet address represents a point on the Ed25519 elliptic curve.

https://preview.redd.it/astjuuasogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7094772d293060d90b5e9e70e2d4c65a13fe3a

The user signs transactions with their private key. This signature is included with the transaction data and can be verified by other participants using the sender's public key. This process ensures the transaction has not been tampered with and is authorized by the owner of the corresponding private key. The signature also acts as a unique identifier for the transaction.

# Solana Transactions

Sending a transaction is the only way to mutate state on Solana. Any write operation is performed through a transaction, and transactions are atomic‚Äîeither everything the transaction attempts to do happens or the transaction fails. A transaction, more formally known as a ""transaction message,"" comprises four sections: a header, a list of account addresses, a recent blockhash, and instructions.

https://preview.redd.it/yl7lvpouogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5349733808055e00bf0a209ed2174abd529619d7

* Header: The header contains references to the account address list, indicating which accounts must sign the transaction.
* Account Addresses: This list includes all the accounts that will be read from or written to during the transaction. Building such a list for every transaction is a requirement unique to Solana and can be challenging for developers. However, knowing in advance which pieces of state a transaction will interact with enables optimizations not possible on many other blockchains.
* Recent Blockhash: This is used to prevent duplicate and stale transactions. A recent blockhash expires after 150 blocks (about 1 minute). By default, RPCs attempt to forward transactions every 2 seconds until the transaction is either finalized or the recent blockhash expires, at which point the transaction is dropped.
* Instructions: These form the core part of the transaction. Each instruction represents a specific operation (e.g., transfer, mint, burn, create account, close account). Each instruction specifies the program to execute, the accounts required, and the data needed for the instruction's execution.

The number of instructions in a transaction is limited first by its size, which can be up to 1,232 bytes. There are also limits around the number of accounts that can be referenced. Lastly, there are limits to a transaction‚Äôs complexity measured in compute units (CUs). CUs quantify the computational resources expended in processing transactions.

# Remember

*The smallest unit of SOL is known as a ""lamport,"" equivalent to one billionth of a SOL, similar to a satoshi in Bitcoin. The lamport is named after* [*Leslie Lamport*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)*, a computer scientist and mathematician whose research established many theoretical foundations of modern distributed systems.*

The cost in SOL to execute a transaction is separated into 2 parts - a base fee and a prioritization fee. The base fee is a fixed 5000 lamports per signature cost irrespective of the transaction‚Äôs complexity‚Äîusually, there is 1 signature per transaction.

Prioritization fees are technically optional, but during periods of high demand for blockspace become necessary. These fees are priced in micro-lamports (millionth of a lamport) per compute unit. Their purpose is to act as a price signal, making transactions more economically compelling for validator nodes to include in their blocks.¬†

`total fee = prioritization fee + base fee`

`prioritization fee = compute unit price (micro-lamports) x compute unit limit`

Currently, 50% of all transaction-related fees are burnt, permanently removing this SOL from circulation with the remaining 50% going to the block producer. A new change (SIMD 96) is soon to be introduced allowing for 100% of prioritization fees to go to the block producer. Base fees remain unchanged.

# Sending transactions

https://preview.redd.it/ciea7ftyogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0407e01298915f6b4310da6b5271465500f8be7d

A user connects their wallet to the application, allowing the app to read the user‚Äôs public key. The private key remains encrypted and securely sandboxed in a separate environment from the application.

The application builds the transaction message parameters based on the user‚Äôs interactions. For example, if a user wanted to swap two tokens, they would specify the amount of tokens to buy, the corresponding tokens to sell, and an acceptable transaction slippage.

‚ÄçOnce the transaction message is ready, it is sent to the wallet to be signed with the user‚Äôs private key. At this point, the user is prompted with a popup to confirm their willingness to transact. This popup may include a simulation of the transaction‚Äôs results. Once signed, the transaction message and the signature are returned to the app, which can then forward the transaction to an RPC provider of their choice, either their own or by using the wallet‚Äôs provider.

‚ÄçRPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers act as intermediaries between applications and the validators that build blocks. They are an essential service that enables applications to [submit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/cd6f931223181d5a1d47cba64e857785a175a760/rpc/src/rpc.rs#L3396) or simulate signed transactions and efficiently retrieve on-chain data. Applications that wish to interact with the network do so via a JSON-RPC or a WebSocket endpoint ([docs](https://solana.com/docs/rpc)).

# Remember

*The term ‚Äúfailed transaction‚Äù on Solana is misleading and has caused considerable confusion. These transactions incur fees and are executed successfully by the runtime exactly as the signer intended. They ‚Äúfail‚Äù due to the transaction‚Äôs own logic requiring them to do so. +80% of ‚Äúfailed‚Äù transactions come from error code 0x1771, the code for exceeding slippage amount (*[*data*](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/zapokorny/q/18zuYlugBdcm/solana-failed-txs-by-program)*). Notably, 95% of these transactions are submitted by only 0.1% of active Solana addresses, primarily automated bots attempting to take advantage of time-sensitive price arbitrage opportunities.*

# Gulf Stream

*‚ÄúLiterally the goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world ‚Äî so speed of light through fiber. Who we‚Äôre competing with is NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.‚Äù ‚Äî Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) refer to RPC nodes. These nodes can be thought of as gateways to interact with and read data from the network. They run the same software as full validators but with different settings, allowing them to accurately simulate transactions and maintain an up-to-date view of the current state. As of this writing, there are over 4,000 RPC nodes on the Solana network.

‚ÄçUnlike full validator nodes, RPC nodes do not hold any stake in the network. Without stake, they cannot vote or build blocks. This setup differs from most other blockchains, where the validator and RPC nodes are typically the same. Since RPC nodes do not receive staking rewards, the economics of running RPC nodes are distinct from those of validators with many operating as a paid service for developers running Solana applications.

‚ÄçSolana stands out because it was designed from the outset to operate without a mempool. Unlike traditional blockchains that use gossip protocols to randomly and broadly propagate transactions across the network, Solana forwards all transactions to a predetermined lead validator, known as the leader, for each slot.

https://preview.redd.it/efimg7g5pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ddc929f7c96b3eb528f3d8768388853e1c62db

# Callout

*Solana operates four clusters: Localnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet-Beta. When people refer to Solana or the Solana network, they almost always refer to Mainnet-Beta. Mainnet-Beta is the only cluster where tokens hold real value, while the other clusters are used solely for testing purposes.*

‚ÄçOnce an RPC receives a transaction message to be included in a block, it must be forwarded to the leader. A leader schedule is produced before every epoch (approximately every two days). The upcoming epoch is divided into slots, each fixed at 400 milliseconds, and a leader is chosen for each slot. Validators with a higher stake will be chosen more often to become leader within each epoch. During each slot, transaction messages are forwarded to the leader, who has the opportunity to produce a block. When it is a validator‚Äôs turn, they switch to ""leader mode,"" begin actively processing transactions and broadcasting blocks to the rest of the network.

# ‚ÄçStake-Weighted Quality of Service - SWQoS

‚ÄçIn early 2024, Solana introduced a new mechanism aimed at preventing spam and enhancing Sybil resistance, known as ""Stake-Weighted Quality of Service"" (SWQoS). This system enables leaders to prioritize transaction messages that are proxied through other staked validators. Here, validators with a higher stake are granted a proportionally higher capacity to transmit transaction message packets to the leader. This approach effectively mitigates Sybil attacks from non-staked nodes across the network.

https://preview.redd.it/gacy1qn8pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e510254be8f3dfe4465bb02297771ec19e98024

Under this model, validators can also engage in agreements to lease their stake-weighted capacity to RPC nodes. In return, RPC nodes gain increased bandwidth, allowing them to achieve greater transaction inclusion rates in blocks. Notably, 80% of a leader‚Äôs capacity (2,000 connections) is reserved for SWQoS. The remaining 20% (500 connections) is allocated for transaction messages from non-staked nodes. This allocation strategy mirrors priority lanes on highways, where drivers pay a toll to avoid traffic.

‚ÄçSWQoS has impacted the Solana ecosystem by raising the requirements to forward transactions to the leader and reducing the effectiveness of spam attacks. The change has incentivized high-traffic applications to vertically integrate their operations. By running their own validator nodes, or by having access to staked connections, applications can ensure privileged access to the leader, thereby enhancing their transaction processing capabilities.

# ‚ÄçA QUIC Note

‚ÄçIn late 2022, Solana adopted the [QUIC networking protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to manage transaction message transmission to the leader. This transition was prompted by network disruptions caused by bots spamming on-chain NFT mints. QUIC facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication.

https://preview.redd.it/hqfeng0bpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a7002fb6203d3e7535299c6a4340f55cc8927d

Initially developed by [Google](https://research.google/pubs/the-quic-transport-protocol-design-and-internet-scale-deployment/) in 2012, QUIC attempts to offer the best of both worlds. It facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication similar to UDP, but with the secure sessions and advanced flow control strategies of TCP. This allows for limits to be placed on individual sources of traffic so that the network can focus on processing genuine transactions. It also has a concept of separate streams; so if one transaction is dropped, it doesn‚Äôt need to block the remaining ones. In short, QUIC can be thought of as attempting to combine the best characteristics of TCP and UDP.

# ‚ÄçCallout box

*Stake-weighting is a recurring principle found throughout Solana's systems, encompassing voting rewards, turbine trees, leader schedules, Gulf Stream, and the gossip network. Validators with greater stake are accorded higher trust and prioritized roles in the network.*

# ‚ÄçBlock Building

*‚ÄúWe consider SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) the best in terms of virtual machine technology currently.‚Äù ‚Äî Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation*

Many blockchain networks construct entire blocks before broadcasting them, known as discrete block building. Solana, in contrast, employs continuous block building which involves assembling and streaming blocks dynamically as they are created during an allocated time slot, significantly reducing latency.

‚ÄçEach slot lasts 400 milliseconds, and each leader is assigned four consecutive slots (1.6 seconds) before rotation to the next leader. For a block to gain acceptance, all transactions within it must be valid and reproducible by other nodes.

‚ÄçTwo slots before assuming leadership, a validator halts transaction forwarding to prepare for its upcoming workload. During this interval, inbound traffic spikes, reaching over a gigabyte per second as the entire network directs packets to the incoming leader.

‚ÄçUpon receipt, transaction messages enter the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), the validator's core logic responsible for block production. Here, the transaction processing sequence begins with the Fetch Stage, where transactions are received via QUIC. Subsequently, transactions progress to the SigVerify Stage, undergoing rigorous validation checks. Here the validator verifies the validity of signatures, checks for the correct number of signatures, and eliminates duplicate transactions.

# Banking Stage

The banking stage can be described as the block-building stage. It is the most important stage of the TPU, which gets its name from the ‚Äúbank‚Äú. A bank is just the state at a given block. For every block, Solana has a bank that is used to access state at that block. When a block becomes finalized after enough validators vote on it, they will flush account updates from the bank to disk, making them permanent. The final state of the chain is the result of all confirmed transactions. This state can always be recreated from the blockchain history deterministically.

‚ÄçTransactions are processed in parallel and packaged into ledger ‚Äúentries,‚Äù which are batches of 64 non-conflicting transactions. Parallel transaction processing on Solana is made easy because each transaction must include a complete list of all the accounts it will read and write to. This design choice places a burden on developers but allows the validator to avoid race conditions by easily selecting only non-conflicting transactions for execution within each entry. Transactions conflict if they both attempt to write to the same account (two writes) or if one attempts to read from and the other writes to the same account (read + write). Thus conflicting transactions go into different entries and are executed sequentially, while non-conflicting transactions are executed in parallel.

‚ÄçThere are six threads processing transactions in parallel, with four dedicated to normal transactions and two exclusively handling vote transactions which are integral to Solana‚Äôs consensus mechanism. All parallelization of processing is achieved through multiple CPU cores; validators have no GPU requirements ([docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements)).

‚ÄçOnce transactions have been grouped into entries, they are ready to be executed by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The accounts necessary for the transaction are locked; checks are run to confirm the transaction is recent but hasn‚Äôt already been processed. The accounts are loaded, and the transaction logic is executed, updating the account states. A hash of the entry will be sent to the Proof of History service to be recorded (more on this in the next section). If the recording process is successful, all changes will be committed to the bank, and the locks on each account placed in the first step are lifted. Execution is done by the SVM, a virtual machine built using the Solana fork of [rBPF](https://docs.rs/solana_rbpf/latest/solana_rbpf/), a library for working with JIT compilation, and virtual machines for eBPF programs. Note Solana does not mandate how validators choose to order transactions within a block. This flexibility is a crucial point that we will return to later in the Economics + Jito section of this report.

# ‚ÄçRemember

*The term SVM can be ambiguous, as it may refer to either the ""Solana Virtual Machine"" or the ""Sealevel Virtual Machine."" Both terms describe the same concept, with Sealevel being the name of Solana's runtime environment. The term SVM continues to be loosely thrown around despite recent efforts to precisely* [*define its boundaries*](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/anzas-new-svm-api)*.*

# ‚ÄçClients

‚ÄçSolana is a network comprising thousands of independently operated nodes collaborating to maintain a single unified ledger. Each node constitutes a high-performance machine running the same open-source software known as a ‚Äúclient‚Äù.

‚ÄçSolana launched with a single validator client software ‚Äî originally the Solana Labs client, now known as the [Agave client ](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave)‚Äî written in Rust. Expanding client diversity has been a priority ever since and one that will truly come to fruition with the launch of the [Firedancer client](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer). Firedancer is a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language. Built by an experienced team from high-frequency trading firm Jump, it promises to be the most performant validator client on any blockchain.

# Proof of History

*‚ÄúI had two coffees and a beer, and I was up until 4:00 AM. I had this eureka moment that puzzle \[sic\] similar to proof of work using the same SHA-256 preimage-resistant hash function‚Ä¶ I knew that I had this arrow of time.‚Äù ‚Äî Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Proof of History (PoH) is Solana's secret sauce, functioning like a special clock in every validator that facilitates synchronization across the network. PoH establishes a reliable source of truth for the order of events and the passage of time. Most critically it ensures adherence to the leader schedule. Despite similar names, Proof of History is not a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work.

https://preview.redd.it/5m9vzdnppgbe1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b68f99530f62595829ba76bdf159cb127f2940

Communication overhead between nodes typically increases as networks expand, and coordination becomes increasingly complicated. Solana mitigates this by replacing node-to-node communication with a PoH local computation. This means validators can commit to a block with just a single round of voting. Trusted timestamps in messages ensure that validators cannot step over each other and start their blocks prematurely.

Underlying PoH are the unique properties of hashing algorithms, specifically [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2):

* **Deterministic:**¬†The same input will always produce the same hash.
* **Fixed Size:**¬†Regardless of input size, the output hash is always 256 bits.
* **Efficient:**¬†It is fast to compute the hash for any given input.
* [**Preimage Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack)**:**¬†Finding the original input from the hash output is computationally infeasible.
* **Avalanche Effect:**¬†A small change in the input (even a single bit) results in a significantly different hash, a property known as the avalanche effect.
* [**Collision Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance)**:**¬†It is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

Within each validator client, a dedicated ""Proof of History service"" continually runs the SHA256 hash algorithm creating a chain of hashes. Each hash‚Äôs input is the previous hash's output. This chain acts the same as a verifiable delay function, given that the hashing work must be done in sequence and the results of future hashes cannot be known ahead of time.¬†If the PoH service creates a chain of a thousand hashes, we know time has passed for it to have calculated each hash sequentially ‚Äî this can be thought of as a ‚Äúmicro proof of work.‚Äù Yet, other validators can verify the correctness of the thousand hashes in parallel at a much faster rate than they were produced since the input and output of each hash have been broadcast to the network. Therefore, PoH is difficult to produce but easy to verify.

The range of performance in computing SHA-256 across different CPUs is surprisingly narrow, with only small differences among the fastest machines. A common upper limit has already been reached, despite significant time and effort being invested in optimizing this function, largely due to Bitcoin's reliance on it.

https://preview.redd.it/p1t6rq7rpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddadf711c11df6317b747e41a541200de8fb6eab

During a leader‚Äôs slot, the PoH service will receive newly processed entries from the banking stage. The current PoH hash plus a hash of all transactions in the entry are combined into the next PoH hash. This serves as a timestamp that inserts the entry into the chain of hashes, proving the sequence in which transactions were processed. This process not only confirms the passage of time but also serves as a cryptographic record of the transactions.

In a single block, there are 800,000 hashes. The PoH stream also includes ""ticks,"" which are empty entries indicating the leader's liveness and the passage of time approximating a small fraction of a second. A tick occurs every 6.25 milliseconds, resulting in 64 ticks per block and a total block time of 400 milliseconds.

Validators continually run the PoH clock even when they are not the leader as it plays a pivotal role in the process of synchronization between nodes.

# Remember

*The key benefit of PoH is that it ensures the correct leader schedule must be adhered to, even if a block producer is offline ‚Äî a state known as being ‚Äúdelinquent‚Äù. PoH prevents a malicious validator from producing blocks before their turn.*

# Accounts Model

*‚ÄúSeparating code and state in SVM was the best design decision. Blessed are the embedded system devs that religiously drilled this concept into my brain.‚Äù ‚Äî Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Within a Solana validator, the global state is maintained in the accounts database known as AccountsDB. This database is responsible for storing all accounts, both in memory and on disk. The primary data structure in the account index is a hashmap, making AccountsDB essentially a vast [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database). Here, the key is the account address, and the value is the account data.

‚ÄçOver time the number of Solana accounts has surged into the hundreds of millions. This large number is partly because, as Solana developers are fond of saying, ""Everything on Solana is an account!""

https://preview.redd.it/od9jdizvpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad934df81448f583fc49d29e7306cef5a4dc505

# Solana accounts

‚ÄçAn account is a container that persistently holds data, similar to a file on a computer. They come in various forms:

‚ÄçUser accounts: These accounts have a private key and are typically generated by a wallet software for a user.

* Data accounts: These accounts store state information, such as the number of a specific token a user holds.
* Program accounts: These are larger accounts that contain executable bytecode, somewhat equivalent to a .exe file on Windows or a .app file on Mac.
* Native program accounts: These are special pre-deployed program accounts that perform various core functionalities of the network.¬†[Examples](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/programs)¬†include the Vote Program and the BPF Loader.

‚ÄçAll accounts have the following fields:

https://preview.redd.it/ek1vnit0qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c085da69525391de492cb3eb50db8d3fea40a330

# Programs

Solana program accounts contain only executable logic. This means when a program is run it mutates the state of other accounts but remains unchanged itself. This separation of code and state differentiates Solana from other blockchains and supports many of its optimizations. Developers primarily write these programs in Rust, a general-purpose programming language [known](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf) for its strong focus on safety and performance. Additionally, multiple SDKs in [TypeScript](https://www.helius.dev/blog/build-solana-programs-with-typescript-poseidon) and Python are available to facilitate the creation of application front-ends and enable programmatic interaction with the network.

‚ÄçMany common functionalities are provided out-of-the-box by native programs. For example, Solana does not require developers to deploy code to create a token. Instead, instructions are sent to a pre-deployed native program that will set up an account to store the token‚Äôs metadata, effectively creating a new token.

# ‚ÄçRent

‚ÄçRent is a mechanism designed to incentivize users to close accounts and reduce state bloat. To create a new account, a minimum balance of SOL, known as the ""rent-exempt"" amount, must be held by the account. This can be considered a storage cost incurred to keep the account alive in a validator's memory. If the size of the account's data increases, the minimum balance rent requirement increases proportionally. When an account is no longer needed, it can be closed, and the rent is returned to the account owner.¬†

‚ÄçFor example, if a user holds a dollar-denominated stablecoin, this state is stored in a token account. Currently, the rent-exempt amount for a token account is 0.002 SOL. If the user transfers their entire stablecoin balance to a friend, the token account can be closed, and the user will receive back their 0.002 SOL. Programs often handle account closures automatically for users. Several applications are available to help users clean up old, unused accounts and reclaim the small amounts of SOL stored in them.

# ‚ÄçOwnership

‚ÄçWhile reading account data is universally permitted, Solana's ownership model enhances security by restricting exactly who can modify (write) an account's data. This concept is crucial for enforcing rules and permissions on the Solana blockchain. Every account has a program ""owner"". The owner of an account is responsible for governing it, ensuring that only authorized programs can change the account's data. A notable exception to this rule is the transfer of lamports (the smallest unit of SOL)‚Äîincreasing an account's lamports balance is universally permitted, regardless of ownership.

# ‚ÄçStorage of State

‚ÄçSolana programs, being read-only executable files, must store state using ‚ÄúProgram Derived Addresses‚Äù (PDAs). PDAs are special types of accounts associated with and owned by a program rather than a specific user. While normal Solana user addresses are derived from the public key of an Ed25519 key pair, PDAs do not have a private key. Instead, their public key is derived from a combination of parameters‚Äîoften keywords or other account addresses‚Äîalong with the program ID (address) of the owning program.

‚ÄçPDA addresses exist ""off-curve,"" meaning they are not on the Ed25519 curve like normal addresses. Only the program that owns the PDA can programmatically generate signatures for it, ensuring that it‚Äôs the only one that can modify the PDA's state.

https://preview.redd.it/82dag167qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5e5694b996bf17c3928282a7cf37dfb104b75e

Above: Solana token accounts are specific examples of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). They are used to hold tokens and live ‚Äúoff-curve.‚Äù The Associated Token Account (ATA) program ensures that each wallet can only have one associated token account for each token type, providing a standardized way to manage token accounts.

# ‚ÄçTurbine

*‚ÄúThe most interesting part about Solana is not parallelization, the SVM, or Toly's tweets. It is something you probably haven't heard of: Turbine.‚Äù ‚Äî Mert Mumtaz, Helius*

During the banking stage, transactions are organized into entries and sent to the Proof of History stream for timestamping. The block's bank is updated, and the entries are now ready for the next phase‚ÄîTurbine.

Turbine is the process through which the leader propagates their block to the rest of the network. Inspired by [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), it is designed to be fast and efficient, reducing communication overhead and minimizing the amount of data a leader needs to send.

https://preview.redd.it/t9ijgbvaqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c0ee8a717f6c145ad661e1855ec49a38917e9f

Turbine achieves this by breaking down transaction data into ""shreds'' through a process called ""shredding."" Shreds are small packets of data, up to 1280 bytes, similar to individual frames in a video stream. When reassembled, these shreds allow validators to replay the entire block. The shreds are sent over the internet between validators using UDP and utilize erasure coding to handle packet loss or malicious dropping of packets. [Erasure coding](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/reedsolomon/reed_solomon_codes.html#), a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)\-based error detection and correction scheme, ensures data integrity. Even if some shreds are lost, the block can still be reconstructed.

Shreds are grouped into batches known as forward error correction (FEC) batches. By default, these batches consist of 64 shreds (32 data shreds + 32 recovery shreds). Data recovery occurs per FEC batch, meaning that up to half the packets in a batch can be lost or corrupted, and all the data can still be recovered. Each 64 shred batch is merkelized with the root being signed by the leader, and chained to the previous batch. This process ensures that shreds can be securely obtained from any node in the network that possesses them, as the chain of Merkle roots provides a verifiable path of authenticity and integrity.

The leader initially broadcasts to a single root node, which disseminates the shreds to all other validator nodes. This root node changes with each shred. Validators are organized into layers, forming the ""Turbine Tree."" Validators with a larger stake amount are typically positioned toward the top of the tree, while those with lower stakes are placed toward the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/3mflwjhcqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50409eac7cb3e07884ed130f632c95b3590541ba

The tree usually spans two or three hops, depending on the number of active validators. For visual simplicity, a fanout of 3 is depicted above, but Solana‚Äôs actual fanout value is currently set to 200. For security reasons, the order of the tree is rotated for each new batch of shreds.

The primary goal of such a system is to alleviate the outbound data egress pressure on the leader and root nodes. By utilizing a system of transmit and retransmit, the load is distributed between the leader and the retransmitters, reducing the strain on any single node.

# Consensus

*‚ÄúSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana‚Ä¶ I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive‚Äù ‚Äî Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder*

Once a validator receives a new block from the leader via Turbine, it must validate all transactions within each entry. This involves replaying the entire block, validating the PoH hashes in parallel, recreating the transactions in the sequence dictated by PoH, and updating its local bank.¬†

[**https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png**](https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png)

This process is handled by the Transaction Validation Unit (TVU), which is analogous to the leader‚Äôs Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), serving as the core logic responsible for processing shreds and block validation. Like the TPU, the TVU flow is broken down into several stages, starting with the Shred Fetch Stage where shreds are received over Turbine. In the subsequent Shred Verify Leader Signature Stage, the shreds undergo multiple sanity checks, most notably the verification of the leader‚Äôs signature, which ensures that the received shreds originated from the leader.¬†

‚ÄçIn the Retransmit Stage, the validator, based on its location in the Turbine tree, forwards the shreds to the appropriate downstream validators. In the Replay Stage, the validator recreates each transaction exactly and in the correct order while updating its local version of the bank.

‚ÄçThe Replay Stage is analogous to the banking stage in the TPU; it is the most important stage and can be more directly described as the block validation stage. Replay is a single-threaded process loop that orchestrates many key operations, including voting, resetting the PoH clock, and switching banks.¬†

Ever wondered how tokens work on the Solana blockchain? What does a ‚Äúcreate token account‚Äù transaction mean?

https://preview.redd.it/nj77i7j1mgbe1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5c450c74be676992742c1c1438a82288d852ec

Unlike some other blockchains, Solana uses a special system called ‚Äúassociated token accounts‚Äù to handle tokens efficiently and securely. Let‚Äôs break it down in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand, with examples you can relate to!

# What Is an Associated Token Account (ATA)?

Imagine you‚Äôve got a locker at school. Each locker is labeled with your name and can only store one type of item ‚Äî say books, snacks, or gym clothes. On Solana, an associated token account is like your personal locker for a specific token. It‚Äôs tied to your wallet (your unique ID) and can only hold one kind of token, like USDC or Bonk or Pengu.

This setup keeps everything organized and easy to find. It also ensures that tokens are stored safely in the right place.

# Why Do You Need an ATA?

Here‚Äôs the deal: before you can use a token ‚Äî whether to buy something, trade, or receive an airdrop ‚Äî you need a specific locker (an ATA) for that token. Without it, you‚Äôd have nowhere to store the token! Let‚Äôs look at some reasons why this is important:

1. **Organization:**¬†Everyone‚Äôs tokens are stored in their own lockers, so it‚Äôs clear who owns what.
2. **Compatibility:**¬†Apps and games on Solana know where to look for your tokens because ATAs follow a standard design.
3. **Simplicity:**¬†You don‚Äôt need to manually manage different accounts. The system does it for you!

# How Do You Create an ATA?

Typically, ATAs are created automatically as a part of a buy or transfer transaction. All wallets, trading platforms, and bots handle this for you.

However, sometimes users might want to create an ATA in a separate transaction:

1. This can make your buy or transfer transaction ‚Äúsmaller,‚Äù which increases the chances of it being processed faster ‚Äî especially during times of high network traffic.
2. On the flip side, some spammers take advantage of this system by creating lots of unnecessary ATA transactions trying to trick other people into buying their tokens.

Associated token accounts might sound complicated at first, but they‚Äôre really just a clever way to keep track of tokens on Solana. Think of them as your personal lockers ‚Äî safe, organized, and ready for anything. Whether you‚Äôre playing games, trading, or just holding tokens, ATAs make it all work smoothly.

So next time you hear about ‚Äúcreate associated token account‚Äù transactions, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs just Solana setting up a locker for your tokens. Easy, right? Now go out there and explore the world of Solana!"

iMac G4 - Apple System Profiler Question,VintageApple,1htj7xc,2025-01-04 12:19:40,17,0.92,19,https://i.redd.it/mimwf11jg0be1.jpeg,gaelenski_,,"I‚Äôve got a G4 which boots once every 100 times, when it doesn‚Äôt boot it doesn‚Äôt chime or anything (not even a display flicker, just the fan and CD drive - no keyboard power).  When it last booted I took a pic of the system profiler and looking at it today I noticed it says that ‚Äúa start up device has been chosen but Apple System Profiler can‚Äôt determine what ATA bus it is‚Äù.

Is this normal, or does this point to a legitimate issue somewhere hardware related? "

AirPods 3 case only charges wirelessly,airpods,1hsl7kr,2025-01-03 07:16:48,157,0.98,33,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hsl7kr,ofdtv,,"I discovered the other day that for some reason my AirPods 3 case now only charges when using a wireless charger, the cable doesn‚Äôt work, even though it used to before. First thing I did was check if the port was dirty, and it was very much clean. Just in case (heh) I still tried to clean it some more with a brush, but still no luck. Resetting the AirPods didn‚Äôt help either. Tried multiple cables that are known to be good, plugged them into the 20W and 67W Apple chargers, into my iPad, iPhone, and my MacBook, and the case doesn‚Äôt react to any of those, it doesn‚Äôt even show up in System Report when I connect it to my computer. It‚Äôs as if the port is just completely dead. I‚Äôm on a trip currently, so I had to urgently buy another wireless charger (didn‚Äôt take one from home), so I‚Äôm fine for the time being, but what can be the cause of this? And can it be fixed without getting a new case or another pair of earbuds?

Develop new ai rl training what works like photosynthesis ,ChatGPT,1hsgbfq,2025-01-03 01:41:06,2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hsgbfq/develop_new_ai_rl_training_what_works_like/,Worldly_Evidence9113,Gone Wild ,"Designing an AI reinforcement learning (RL) system inspired by photosynthesis would involve a framework that mimics the way plants efficiently convert light into energy while adapting dynamically to environmental conditions. Below is a conceptual framework to develop such a system:

Conceptual Overview

Photosynthesis is a process of energy capture, conversion, and storage. Translating this to AI:
	1.	Energy Input (Light) = Data or Signals
	‚Ä¢	Just as plants capture light, the AI system collects raw input data streams, such as sensor readings, environmental states, or complex datasets.
	2.	Photosynthetic Reaction = Processing and Learning
	‚Ä¢	The AI processes input through layers of transformations (like photosynthesis stages) to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù data into usable knowledge or strategies.
	3.	Energy Storage (Glucose) = Knowledge and Policies
	‚Ä¢	The system stores learned policies or models for efficient decision-making and adaptation to new tasks.
	4.	Environmental Adaptation = RL Mechanism
	‚Ä¢	Like plants adjusting to sunlight levels, the AI optimizes its learning based on environmental feedback and resource availability.

Key Features of a Photosynthesis-Inspired RL System

1. Light Harvesting: Input Adaptivity
	‚Ä¢	Incorporate adaptive sensing mechanisms that prioritize important inputs while minimizing noise.
	‚Ä¢	Use a data-agnostic architecture where the system adapts to diverse input formats (e.g., images, time-series, text) efficiently.

2. Reaction Centers: Modular Layers
	‚Ä¢	Divide the model into ‚Äúphotosynthetic layers,‚Äù each mimicking a different reaction stage:
	‚Ä¢	Data capture (Light Reactions): Extract basic features (e.g., edges, patterns).
	‚Ä¢	Transformation (Calvin Cycle): Synthesize high-level abstractions and policies.
	‚Ä¢	Introduce energy-efficient processing using low-power or event-driven neuromorphic computing.

3. Energy Storage: Knowledge Preservation
	‚Ä¢	Store learned policies as reusable, modular components:
	‚Ä¢	Analogous to storing glucose for plants, use memory-augmented networks or meta-learning to store and apply knowledge.

4. Adaptation to Light Levels: Dynamic Reward Scaling
	‚Ä¢	Design RL algorithms with dynamic reward systems that reflect resource availability:
	‚Ä¢	High reward for actions under scarce resources (like plants in low light).
	‚Ä¢	Penalize wasteful exploration when data is abundant but uninformative.

5. Waste Reduction: Efficiency Optimization
	‚Ä¢	Minimize computational overhead and maximize utility:
	‚Ä¢	Implement sparse learning algorithms to focus on relevant features.
	‚Ä¢	Use energy-efficient AI hardware or quantum-based processing.

System Design
	1.	Input Layer: Data is captured and filtered for relevancy using dynamic weights.
	2.	Energy Transformation Layer: Multi-step processing, including:
	‚Ä¢	Neural networks for feature extraction.
	‚Ä¢	Reinforcement loops for action optimization.
	3.	Knowledge Storage: Use mechanisms like hierarchical memory to store intermediate outputs as reusable blocks.
	4.	Environmental Feedback Loop: Adjust system parameters dynamically based on performance metrics and environmental data.

Potential Applications
	1.	Sustainable AI Systems: AI for IoT or edge devices with constrained energy budgets.
	2.	Adaptive Robotics: Robots that operate autonomously in varying environments, such as underwater or in space.
	3.	Climate Modeling: AI for monitoring ecosystems by mimicking nature‚Äôs energy efficiency.
	4.	Healthcare: Energy-aware diagnostic systems in low-resource settings.

Research Directions
	‚Ä¢	Explore bio-inspired algorithms (e.g., ant colony, cellular automata) to complement photosynthesis-like RL.
	‚Ä¢	Develop neuromorphic computing systems to emulate energy-efficient biological processes.
	‚Ä¢	Investigate quantum photonics for advanced light-harvesting analogs in AI systems.

This framework integrates the principles of nature‚Äôs energy optimization with the adaptability of RL, pushing the boundaries of AI efficiency and sustainability."

I'm aware that there's some options for optimizing Python when using loops. I've never look into it, though. And honestly, my programs are a mess. Sufficient in the physics world, but would make a computer scientist cry.

Tried Julia, meh, also the prof that taught it to me was an a-hole. C/C++? Idk, not as exciting as a language with a ***cool asf crab*** as its mascot.

So, would Rust be useful for my purposes? I find it interesting enough to just learn it for the laughs but being able to apply it directly in my career would be nice."

Cryptocurrencies in consolidation: discover two promising bets,CapitalistExploits,1hrtq4k,2025-01-02 08:30:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1hrtq4k/cryptocurrencies_in_consolidation_discover_two/,kayakero,,"Currently, the total market value of cryptocurrencies is¬†$3.43 trillion, with a drop of 1.4% in the last 24 hours, reflecting a moment of consolidation and uncertainty. However, in the midst of this scenario, two cryptocurrencies are presenting technical signals that could indicate buying opportunities:¬†**Automata Network (ATA)**¬†and¬†**Secret Network (SCRT)**.

>NFA & DYOR

# Automata Network (ATA)

Automata Network (ATA) is doing well in the short to medium term, supported by technical indicators that signal bullish momentum. ATA‚Äôs 12-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) is¬†60.32¬†and the 24-hour RSI is¬†59.58, which is well above the market average of¬†42.02. These numbers indicate positive momentum and potential for immediate gains.

Moreover, ATA is showing consistent buy signals in the main ranges of the¬†10-¬†,¬†20-¬†and¬†50¬†-period simple and exponential moving averages. The¬†MACD¬†oscillator reinforces this outlook, pointing to further upside potential.

Currently priced at¬†**$0.16**), ATA has seen a rise of¬†4.11%¬†over the past 24 hours, according to data from¬†CoinMarketCap.

Xbox Series X Controller detected as Xbox 360 Controller - Doesn't work in a lot of games! Phantom X360 Controller in Device Manager!?

For my DESKTOP PC my Series X controller is not detected by all games and instead, those games want to use a phantom/imaginary X360 Controller that Windows creates.  Note that, I've wiped Windows a few times and each time, even BEFORE I connect a controller, or do pretty much anything, Windows has already created a phantom/imaginery/non-existant X360 controller!  Note that this controller works perfectly on my Laptop for all games, regardless of Steam or Game Pass)

Here is a brief summary of where the plain white controller works/does not work:

**Working Perfectly**:

Forza Horizon 5 (Game Pass)

Stalker 2 (Game Pass)

**Not Working:**

Lies of P (Game Pass)

Hi-Fi Rush (Game Pass)

Rocket League (Steam)

Steam Client in the Controllers menu is showing TWO controllers -  X360 and Series X Controller. The Steam client also defaults to X360 and whilst I can force it to select the Series X option and the controller button test works but, it quickly defaults back to X360 and games as noted above do not work.  In the Xbox Accessories app ONLY the Series X is showing, not a phantom X360 one, and all button tests works.

Note that I've connected via cable (updated firmware) and also a wireless adapter, this makes no difference.  Anyway, even before connecting a controller the X360 is showing after a fresh build!  Obviously, I've also run Windows Update to death, consider both laptop and desktop fully up-to-date.

I suspect that some games are detecting the phantom/non-existent X360 controller only and not the real Series X."

Se dyti do isha kurioz nese ndonje nga ju me ndihmon me ndonje info ne lidhje me nje problem qe po has. 

Situata eshte qe me vijne ne llogarine e biznesit (banka Raiffeisen Albania) pagesa ne mberritje cdo x dite nga USA ne llogarine ne USD. Derguesi i dergon me komisione SHA (shared), dhe normalisht ne mberritje ne pagese vjen vlera - komisionin e ndare. 

Problemi qendron se, pervec kesaj, Raiffeisen me mban 18.00 USD per cdo pagese (extra, tarife e Raiffeisenit, jo e Swift Network). Per shkak te nr te shpeshte te pagesave qe marr, po shikoj se po paguaj shume (dhe me duket pak pa sens). 

Nga nje lexim i shpejte i kushteve dhe termave gjeta qe raiffeisen mban nje perqindje te shumes per pagesat ne mberritje (minimumi 18 usd dhe max 150 usd)

A ka ndonjeri nga ju eksperience si mund ta zgjidh / ose evitoj kete situate? Ose alternativa ? Nje gje e cuditshme eshte qe per nje kompani tjeter qe paguan nga nje shtet i BE, Raiffeisen mban 5.00‚Ç¨ (per cdo pagese), nuk di tani a eshte ne baze te shtetit te derguesit, apo ne baze te llogarise (eur / usd?)

Pash qe Paysera ofronte te hapje llogari biznesi dhe te jepte nr llogarie ne SEPA (se shqiperia esht futur, por s‚Äôeshte futur üòÖ) dhe supozohet qe taksat do jene me te ulta, po per kete zgjidhje kam nje merak tjeter. Faturat per momentin i leshoj nga biznesi te kompania jashte, nese pagesat do me vijne te kjo llogaria e payseres, per ti cuar ne llogarine e biznesit nuk do te kreditoheshin nga kompania qe kam leshuar faturen por nga llogaria ime e biznesit te paysera ne llogarine time te biznesit te raiffeisen. Mbase e kam mendimin e gabuar te kjo.
