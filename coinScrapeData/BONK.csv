**#1 Organic holder growth** 

Looking at the growth of the amount of holders of $HEGE since its inception in April 2024 (white line on the chart), there's one clear trend: **The amount of holders of $HEGE has been steadily increasing.** Interesting fact here is that **the amount of holders doesn't go down much during a temporary price dip**. This means the long term outlook of the large majority of $HEGE-holders is positive.   
  
The second conclusion that can be drawn from this fact is that $HEGE clearly isn't a pump-and-dump coin. The amount of holders has grown organically with the pace of the project and those holders are there to stay.   
  
Curiously enough, airdropping coins to new holders, a proven tactic for coins such as $BONK, didn't work for $HEGE last September. The big November rally happened after the implementation of the previous phase 2.0 marketing plan. That amplified $HEGE's presence on social media - especially on TikTok - and led to two more exchange listings.

**#2 Campaigns have a big price effect, but delayed**

When $HEGE launched its first large scale marketing campaign in August 2024 the price of the coin **dipped before it went up**. And after $HEGE launched its phase 2.0 marketing push on November 6th, 2024, the coin traded sideways for more than a week **before a x8 rally** happened. Chances are that $HEGE's current **new marketing push will have a similar delayed price effect**.  

**#3 Holders increase before the price increases**  
  
$HEGE currently has 22,864 holders with a market cap of around $20 mln. In the past 7 days, **the amount of holders has been increasing** after going through a consolidation phase. Historically, holder increases after consolidation phases have been followed by dramatic price surges.

My thoughts about the patch.,PlayTheBazaar,1i9urzh,2025-01-25 14:26:03,0,0.38,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayTheBazaar/comments/1i9urzh/my_thoughts_about_the_patch/,Staangg,Discussion,"Hello Bazaar enjoyers. In this post I will try to do a long review of this patch and meta.
I'm not the best player around as I play a game or two a day (mainly because we get to play only the same comp over and over again). I felt like I had to do this post anyway because the main issues I have with current patch are not talked about or addressed enough by the devs.

I'll try to address all the issues I have with the game in general, I think the characters issues are already talked about. It won't always be about balance but about the game being fun. With each issue I'll try to offer an alternative to solve it.
Anyway, feel free to tell me if you agree/disagree with my takes, this post is here to discuss and debate.

To add a little bit of context, I played a lot in november/december and a lot after the patch in january. Mainly Vanessa, I also spend a lot of time watching friends play the bazaar, they play Dooley or Vanessa (and we don't play Pyg because the character sucks)
 
General issues : 

 - Lack of items : I know this issue will be resolved but for now I have a lot of problems enjoying the game and wanting to start a new run, there are so few items that I find myself playing pufferfish for +70% of my games and I don't even try to force the comp, it seems ""impossible"" not to find the core items during the first few days. In fine the game starts getting very boring very quickly. Same goes for Dooley or Pyg (even tho I feel like Pyg has the most ""possible diversity""). This issue is linked with the following one. No solution except adding more items of course


 - Scaling being too powerful : I feel like most (most) of the weapons that we have access to are just rendered totally useless. I'm a Vanessa main but the barrel or the turtle shells are just totally stupid. The fact that a full weapon build can be tanked by a single barrel and no other shield items (while having no real drawback, you play non weapon anyway with a barrel comp) doesn't make any sense. 

Shield, or heal items should, in an healthy meta, slow your death but not be able to tank the storm for 20 seconds at day 5 (except if your board is full of them ofc). Right now you can play two defensive items (turtle shell + pearl for exemple) and be basically immune to any normal weapon build for the price of 3 slots).

This issue makes any ""okayish"" weapon build feel unplayable, making experimentation useless and not fun. 

Or course hard nerfing the scaling of items in general is IMO a necessity. Scaling could be linked to your level or the Day with a maximum for the rarity of the item: For Barrel for exemple it could be like : ""When you use a non weapon item, this gains X shield, X being your level"" 5 shield being max for bronze, 10 for silver etc. It would make the scaling way easier to fight and less powerful in the first days. 


 - Health Items are (in general) terrible compared to shield items : Health Items should have better stats/scaling than shields items simply because they are ""needed"" by their inability to heal more than your total hp. Rn shield can stack infinitely AND the items generating shield are just better than the healing ones. 
Solution is simple, buff the healing item, Vanessa has only one decent heal item, even Pyg's items are not that good and healing is his specialty. 

Heal items removing 1 poison/burn is useless. I saw post on this subreddit saying that removing of % of the poison would work, I agree.

Monsters being too easy : Linked to the last issue, 90% of the monsters rely on weapon damage to kill you, having insane amount of shield gives you free monsters. The monsters that don't rely on shield kill you insanely slow making them super easy anyway. 
Nerfing shield items would be a solution, removing the nerfs that some monsters received would be a solution as well, there are tons of very easy solutions.


 - Monsters skills op : Title. It feels unfun and unfair to lose against someone highrolling the reborn skill. 
Nerfing those skills even more or simply rework them. Bonk could be ""After opponent uses an item slow it for 1 sec"" (could be op in slow comp tho). Reborn should revive you with maximum 50% of your health. Etc etc


 - Characters vendors other than the Dooley, Pyg, Vanessa have 95%+ of trash items, I know it's not a ""real"" issue right now but it feels bad entering their shop.
No solution except balancing these items but it's a lot of work for nothing.


 - Not enough counter : Dooley has a burn counter but other than that, there is no ""good"" counter, nothing to protect your items against the dinosaurs, nothing to remove shield from your opponents (yes, there is the item from Curio but it gets useless super quickly). Nothing to protect you against poison. In general ""fair"" comps don't  have enough tools to get the win.


Adding weapons that deals more damage if your opponent has shield could make Vanessa's weapons build more viable. Or adding an enchant that removes shield could be cool as well. This issue exists because shield scaling is huge and could be resolved simply by nerfing it tho.


- Freeze : Linked to the last one, freeze is unfun and way too powerful, it feels terrible to have your main item frozen for 5 secs especially when the fights can be decided in the first seconds. The anti freeze skill was a banger, bring it back please.


 - Huge power discrepancy between items : It's simple the game is poorly balanced, you have Vanessa's bronze handmade dealing an AMAZING amount of 5 DMG every 7 secs and buffing your weapons (itself included) for 3 DMG only once. And on the other hand you have Dooley's bronze alpha ray, dealing 5 DMG every 5 secs and buffing you weapons (itself included) for 3 DMG every time you use your core. These discrepancy are STU-PID, I don't want to be a hater but it should be the easiest thing to fix as these differences should be seen super easily by any person playing the game.
 

 - Reverting the changes on the duct tape was not the right thing to do : All those ""when you use something shield, burn, deals X dmg"" should be removed OR treated hyper carefully. 
IMO the duct tape needs to be re-reverted ASAP.


That's it for the main issues I have with the game in general, I didn't want the post to be too long so I didn't mention the issues I have with each characters individually, I'll maybe do it later. Anyway, I look forward to reading your ideas or your suggestions ! Thank you for reading and good luck in your next games"

It was a windy day so some of the mile markers were knocked over and towards the last 3 miles I was just holding on for dear life...

### Training
31M. I am relatively new to running in marathons competitively. Ran my first marathon (San Francisco) in 2017 at 4:30ish and was just happy to finish without stopping or walking. Since then I've run 7 more marathons primarily for fun. Was lucky to get into the Chicago Marathon in 2021 which made me want to try for a BQ (sub 3) given the flat course and 3:00 pacer group available. I trained in the stupidest way possible on a treadmill... in Phoenix, AZ (dry heat)... with no idea what fueling was. I could hold my goal pace of 6:50 no problem in very controlled conditions but the second I started that pace in Chicago with one of the warmest and most humid days in the race's history... I didn't last 3 miles, ended at 3:30. Again, no idea what fueling even was. 

Gave up on a BQ and went back to running for fun. Did two marathons back to back within 8 days of each other in late 2023, finishing 3:55 and 3:53 respectively. I didn't realize one of my coworkers was in that first race too and he finished in 2:47 which blew me away. After hearing about his training and experience he inspired me to try again for a BQ. I (poorly) decided on the Little Rock Marathon in 2024 giving me 11 weeks to train. I landed on the Pfitz 12/70 plan as it seemed approachable and I liked having everything mapped out so clearly. So I skipped the first week of the plan figuring I had a good base coming off of two marathons. At this point some context is needed. I am in the middle of residency, my son was about 11 months old, and I didn't feel safe running outside after a man followed me in his car at 5AM on one of my jogs (in a city not known for safety...). With all that in mind I have to run before my son woke up and I can't go outside, so treadmill it was. I would drive to a gym 10 minutes away every day waking up at 4-5AM. Pretty brutal at times but I hit every single run on that Pfitz plan, and even began training with gels to get used to fueling. Long story short, the Little Rock Marathon has a massive hill right in the middle of the course which I did not adequately train for and which prompted me to bonk way too early at mile 20 resulting in a 3:02 time (also they sent me and some other guys the wrong way adding probably 40 seconds). Not even close to my BQ goal but I felt that had the course been flat I could have done it. Looking back I was also starting to feel hip and knee pains towards the end of the peak training weeks which I attribute to running my recovery runs too hard and introducing hill training too late in the plan which I think didn't allow me to actually fully recover leading up to the race. 

After that... my daughter was born in May! There was of course no time to run in those first few months, though I somehow convinced my wife to let me buy my own treadmill (ended up with a used Sole F80) and to sign up for the Louisiana Marathon. Once my daughter started to sleep through most of the night sometime in June I could start to run again consistently. I gradully built up my weekly base, adding 1.5 miles each week to slowly get to 50 miles per week prior to starting another Pfitz 12/70 block. Ran all of those runs the same pace (7:30ish) which, while dumb, proved to be more than enough challenge for me given that I had to use my treadmill in the garage sometimes in 80-100% humidty and heat in the deep south... in the summer. It was rough at times, but I understood if I could acclimate to the humidity it would likely impart some benefit down the road when I trained in the fall/winter. 

The 12/70 block itself started out very rough as the heat and humidity DID NOT GO AWAY until November where I live, so the two initial long runs with 8 and 10 miles at marathon pace (6:27) were disasters. I was only able to run 2 miles at MP on the first one and 4 miles at MP on the second. At the time I thought I should have been acclimated enough to the humidty to maintain those paces but it truly felt like I'd cause a cardiac event if I kept going. In the subsequent weeks the weather finally cooled off and I did a few LT runs which felt surprisingly doable, then late in the block I did the 12 mile MP long run which felt good, surprisingly good for how poorly the last two MP long runs had gone. This was immenslely encouraging and told me if I could feel that good during the peak of training I could achieve this goal. The remainder of the block was no problem, though I got the odd taper pain here and there in my legs which never lasted more than a day. This was all done on my Sole F80 which was a BEAST and was able to tolerate any speed I used without issue, including in the heat and humidity. I became uncertain of whether it was well calibrated and if I was truly running at a 6:27 pace with how well the 12 mile MP run went but it was too late and I was better off not knowing. 

Last thing on training, I got a pair of Alphafly 3's leading up the race and took them for a spin on two training runs prior to the race. One of the runs was a recovery at a 8:30ish pace which didn't feel very good but the other was the Pfitz dress rehearsal run w/ 2 miles at MP. For those 2 miles they felt like running on a cloud, I was in love. Though unlike others who develop arch blisters I began to have rubbing on my lateral ankle where the lip of the shoe touched which freaked me out. Ended up applying duct tape to both my ankles on this area for the race which prevented any issues!

### Pre-race
Got to Baton Rouge day before the race with my wife and kids who were now 23 months and 8 months old after a very stressful car ride where my 8 month old was crying for most of the time. We packed into a small hotel room and made the best of it, though I was a bundle of nerves by this point and had trouble decompressing. That night I slept ok until 3AM when I couldn't sleep anymore. Tried to quietly wile away the time until 6:30 when I went out into the chilling wind (making it feel like the low 30's!) towards the start point.

### Race
Mile 1-3

As soon as the the race started I fumbled with my apple watch which I was going to use to track my paces so wasn't able to start it for another 30 seconds. Clearly started out too fast as I was overflowing with anxious energy so tried over the next few miles to reel it in a little. About 3 miles in I got very lucky and ran into a guy who asked what time I was going for and we were both going 2:50ish so from then on, we unofficially became each others pacers and motivators. He was much better at maintaing his pace and I genuinely think he was the only reason I actually slowed down a little and didn't bonk later on in the race. 

Mile 4-11

Race was pretty windy and cold, especially as we went around the lake near the LSU campus. Just tried to get into the zone and drank a small amount of water at every station that I could (which I had failed to do in Little Rock). Towards mile 10/11 things started to click into place and I actually started feeling good, possibly because I had slowed down or the wind had died down. 

Mile 13-20

Because I started to feel good again I guess that explains the increase in paces later on midway through the race. Was really in a rhythm at this point and so elated that I wasn't feeling any waning to my energy levels. One hiccup was dropping one of my gels as I pulled it out of my shorts pocket, ran back to get it then did a short quicker sprint to catch up to where I was which may have been a mistake, as after that I gradually began to feel a pain in my right quad that slowly increased in intensity as the race went on.

Mile 20-26.2

At this point I implented my anti-bonk plan. My fueling plan was as follows:

15 minutes pre race: Regular maurten

4 miles: Regular maurten

8 miles: Regular maurten

12 miles: Regular maurten

17 miles: Caf maurten

20 miles: Caf maurten

I wanted to have the caffeine levels in my blood peak as I anticipated any bonk may start to happen. At mile 20 I also threw off my beanie/gloves and singlet which I stuffed in my pocket which luckily coincided with the sun coming out for the first time all morning. And after 20 miles of silence I turned on my pump-up playlist which usually helped me end my long runs on a high note. I don't know how many of these things physically helped but psychologically it helped immensely as I felt the most comfortable I had all race. By this point my pacing buddy and I were matching pace with a third guy and for several miles the three of us were running all together side by side which people in the crowd cheered us on for. These little things were huge in keeping me going as despite everything my quads were starting to complain louder and louder. The last .3 to .4 miles of the race is after you turn right down a large road and you can finally see the finish line right in front of the Lousiiana capitol building. This gave me the final burst of adrenaline that let me finish strong and cross the finish line at 2:49:07, a time I couldn't believe I was seeing.

### Post-race
I immediately went over to a fence and hunched over it. Found my pacing buddy, gave him a grateful hug, and got my medal. I was pleased but mostly in shock at how well it had all gone. It wasn't until I was halfway back to my hotel room that I think it finally dawned on me that I'd achieved my goal and I couldn't help getting emotional. It had been a long, sometimes dumb and reckless journey to get here but it was so gratifying to have it pay off. 


I want to thank this community for being my primary source of information and motivation regarding training plans, discipline, fueling strategies, gear to use, etc. I was excited to put this report out there to show anyone with similar unorthodox training approaches or challenges in their daily life that it was possible!

Final note, the Louisiana Marathon was a fantastic event with a great flat course, crowd support, aid stations, and finish line party, highly recommend to anyone!

I know thrashing their tail or twitching their tail means ""irritation"", so i typically try to back off and let the cat be. But I'm currently babysitting this cat that will come up to me, head bonk, purr and rup all against me while twitching their tail. And when I stop petting the cat, she will continuously rub up against me and especially my hand to get attention and pets. No other signs of irritation, I just really worry about bothering animals. Could tail twitching also just be a sign of general excitement? Because when she does this she seems more excited and playful then irritated. 
Might be a kinda dumb question but I'm curious about these seemingly ""mixed messages"", I'd hate to unintentionally irritate an animal."

Separate slot for pistols and consumables/throwables. His stock for that slot would be Bonk. I feel like PBPP+mad milk might be a little broken though.

Solder:
Different slots for shotguns and everything he can wear (boots, banners, base jumper). His stock would be buff banner because gunboats would make every other weapon have less of one stat, and that’d be weird.

Pyro:
Would have a seperate slot for flare guns. Stock would be flare gun. It’d be pretty cool to use panic attack and flare gun at the same time.

Demoman:
I don’t want to remove Demoknight’s uniqueness, but the only other weapon he has is the base jumper. I looked on the wiki, and the tfc demo had a detpack. It isn’t a jetpack, but I honestly do not care. Demoman has a jetpack now because it’s awesome.

President Trump's new [\#cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/topics/cryptocurrency/top/) pick at the SEC has increased the likelihood of approval for the TRUMP, BONK and DOGE ETFs, he told COINTELEGRAPH. ""This is a bold move that can increase Memcoin's liquidity and gain public acceptance, he said.

The CEO and chief investment officer of [\#ARK](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/topics/ARK/top/) Invest, Inc. CIO) believes [\#TRUMP](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/topics/TRUMP/top/) will lead the next phase of the cryptocurrency revolution.

""The utility of (TRUMP) will not be (omitted) One of the benefits of owning this coin is the assumption that you will be able to meet President Trump.

Mechanical Playtest Session 4/3 Results,RPGdesign,1i9jsuv,2025-01-25 04:59:48,9,0.92,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1i9jsuv/mechanical_playtest_session_43_results/,PianoAcceptable4266,Game Play,"Heyo hiyo!

All righty, so I've finished the last ""full mechanical Playtest"" session! Why 4/3? Well, initially *I thought* it'd be done in 2 (with 1 for chargen testing) but there was a mid-playtest adjustment that drew us out an extra week. That's okay, it resulted in pretty good stuff!

# Session 4: Testing the Audience Mechanics

Oh boy, this went pretty great on a first actual-play evaluation! Let's break it down:

* Since last session was testing ""Engaging a \[Boss Monster\] while under equipped/prepared,"" which went approximately as intended from my end: The party either TPKs or has to retreat, but there is sufficient information to the Player-Heroes that *were they prepared for the fight, it'd be definitively winnable*. Additionally, I was able to confirm that the fight *was winnable in the current party state*, except it would be *an incredibly challenging prospect*. This is all intended, as this is more ""Combat is War"" I suppose, although I internally pose it as ""Engaging in Combat is a question the Party has legitimate reason to ask *before* engaging Bonk.""
* Due to 2/4 Player-Heroes dying in the last Playtest (because they stuck around longer than they should have), they were reverted to 1/2 Health and 1 Wound from Death \[For those curious, Health represents cuts/bruises/minor injuries that accumulate toward incapacitation, but Wounds are long-term debilitations that determine if a person *dies* at 0 Health; Health recovers with rest, Wounds require Chirurgery efforts\]
* We doled out a few points of Fatigue to accommodate the week-long travel to Valefort, the local Capital and setting for the last mechanic to be play-tested.
* Did a bit of Skill Checks for the Druid/Healer in the party, who managed to put the party back together  for the most part over the course of a day. This worked nice and buttery smooth.
* During the Chirurgery efforts, the other party members requested an Audience with the Marquis with a one day delay.
* Party spent their one-free day to Prepare for the Audience: Carousing in taverns and alehouses whilst talking loudly about beating up some cultists and hunting for reactions (Carouse); Prowling the streets hunting for information about banditry work and such (Streetwise); Gaining access to various Court Records to evaluate the level and type of biases for the Court (Statecraft); Going to chat up the local Guards about *who* they are going to be Petitioning (Guard Profession reduced difficulty Command)
* Party had 3 successful endeavors, finding out word on the street was banditry work was on the rise due to a sour harvest giving cause to take from others if easy, Court Records revealed the Marquis and Advisors had a preference toward the northern regions of the kingdom (Events took place in the south), and the Guards chatted a bit with one of their own about the various members (Marquis, Spiritual Adviser, Scout/Commerce, and Military, some Proud and others Pragmatic)
* The next day, the Party engaged the Audience.
   * They made Introductions, and found the Court was Open (Normal Difficulty) with moderate Concerns (3) about the request for an Audience. The Merchant character made a Courtesy Check and was able to assuage some Concerns (3 -> 2) and re-phrase their petition to make the Court more Agreeable (1 Net Success from Party to gain full Support).
   * The Audience begins.
      * Merchant and Guard decide to push their Petition, whilst the Farmer and Laborer decide they are best served hanging back and trying to smooth any foibles through Diplomatic Recovery (if needed, else just vibe).
      * Guard fails to make an impact (0 Successes), but the Merchant hits a Opening on the Spiritualist *and* scores a Heroic Success (3 Successes)!
      * Court poses some Concerns about ""Bumpkins jumping at Grumpkins"", stretched resources, and that the Laklunders are raising warnings of a great threat but not stating *what* that threat was. In the end, the Court's Concerns only count against 2 Successes (reducing the Party to 1 Net Success).
      * Happily for the Party, this ends with their petition efforts *still* pushing them up to a tier and garnering *Full Court Support*.
   * The Court decides to spend a few available resources to help secure the local townships and keep the road safe for trade and travel, whilst also noting the beat up state of the Party; each Party member is gifted an item (Coppered Quarterstaff for Guard, Tower Shield for Laborer, a Fine Fur Cloak for the Merchant, and totem bound with a Spirit for Convocation to the Druid) as both reward for their valiant efforts, but also to help them better secure their own homes.
* That ended the Mechanical Playtest.

# Playtester Immediate Feedback

Feedback was surprisingly limited overall, in a good way! It mainly was focused on a few different points, as well as one (what I'll call) 'Hard Perception Issue':

1. (Myself) Travel mechanics were functional but had some clunk. I'm going to re-evaluate and smooth out some roughness.
2. The Audience Mechanics were raved about, even though they went for only 1 round. All the Players immediately responded with ""Oh shit, we totally see how this does things and is *SO NICE* compared to D&D/PF One-Roll-and-Done style stuff!"" They especially loved the (optional) ability to try to research targeted points and information before the Audience, and how they were effectively doing an super granular Opposed Check instead of a Combat-type feel.
3. There was a note that Fatigue feels better to count *up* from zero to max, rather than down; This makes it feels consistent with building *up* Exhaustion once Fatigue is full.
4. There was a discussion about removing Fatigue entirely, which by the end of discussion may be solved: Remove Fatigue, and only deal in Exhaustion but implement the Wizard's Staff concept based on Basic Role-Play (e.g. Quarterstaff/Wand is specially crafted to store 3x Recovery Rate worth of Energy, that is expended when casting Spells *before* the caster gains Exhaustion/Debilitation/Harm)
5. The most interesting part of feedback was a long discussion with a single play-tester vs me and the rest: The pre-stated ""Low/No-Win Boss Fight"" of last session bothered them since they struggled to understand how it was winnable.
   1. There were multiple aspects here: First was concern that having a spell on their character sheet felt bad they only had 30% to cast it in combat (they did *not* spec into it at all). They were exclusively a D&D5e player, and thought it was effectively a 0-Level Cantrip. This misperception was corrected, and other playtesters pointed out that if they'd put any focus in the spell it'd be much more useful to their character. This was conceded on secondary assessment by the player.
   2. The player also asked *how I saw a way to win the unexpected (and intentionally over-aimed Boss Fight); I pointed out that they actually damaged the Demon's Armor, but didn't follow through to negate it, that it had roughly the same HP as them but just higher defense, and that it's two noted abilities (Health Recovery and Invisibility) were random chance occurrences (that obviously were not in their favor).* The other playtesters pointed out that *I* specifically stated, *in no uncertain terms*, this fight was at the upper tier of difficulty *and* their characters were not prepared for it (I was performing a test that Boss Encounters were tuned toward needing knowledge/prep, and that retreat is an option).
   3. When asked how to fight something that is Invisible, and the difficulties it poses (by this player), I pointed out they used their wolfhound companion to sniff it out and point its position (reducing the effect of Invisibility for multiple party-members). I also noted they were by a bone-fire, and could have easily tossed ash at it to make it semi-visible. The Player's response was primarily: ""Huh, I guess. That makes sense, I just am not used to thinking about things like that since I mainly play crunchy board games."" (So this means, I think I have a bit of OSR design in me?)
   4. The Player also felt that combat was Deadly, which I considered, acknowledged, and realized that since the Gear Treadmill isn't *really* part of **The Hero's Call** (since it's not a D&D-like or other looter game) that I could adjust that easily with chargen and starter gear. All players agreed it made sense that a Smith Guard (who typically wears Coat of Plates) should be able to start with Coat of Plate armor and such. This is easy to adjust, since the goal is: ""Dangerous, but not Deadly"" level of combat; for clarity, the intent is for major Combat to be Dangerous to engage in, but not Deadly by default.
   5. Other Play-testers noted that part of the difficulty with the Boss Fight (last week) was multiple points converging: 1) Players were D&D5e and PF mindset players (Combat is Sport, No Retreat), 2) The Playtesters were too focused on Damage (Boss Combat is more a Puzzle than a Sponge), and 3) the characters were woefully unprepared and unknowledgeable to what they faced (Witcher 3 Monster Contracts were used as a reference point).
6. Overall, the general results regarding Combat was ""If it's Mundane, it seems like it is generally achievable"" and ""If it's Monstrous, we should try to be prepared as possible, or allow ourselves to run if needed.""
7. There was a request to evaluate more Mundane Tier combat, which is intended to ""Be a Threat if you're caught off-guard or get too cocky"" type of stuff. A Pack of Wolves might retreat if one is killed, a duet of armored Knights might retreat if Wounded or Armor Broken, etc. But there was a curiosity to test Mundane further to get a feel for the ""more common"" types of Combat, when it occurs.
8. There was a short discussion about Travel, Rations, and Torches with an immediately actionable result: During Travel (Going from Known A to Known B) the various resources of Travel/Expeditions are taken as a Party Pool as appropriate. Example: If Theophania, Jurgen, and Brocksen all have 8 total Ration Quantity but Keagan doesn't have any, then when the Quartermaster has an Event whilst Traveling they make a Check vs. 8 Rations for *everyone*. A Fail is -4 Rations (1 per character) but a Success is -2 (1/2 per character). Although as I type this I think I can do better and have it -1 Ration/Success (Levels of Success system) allowing a fantastic Quartermaster to spread 1 Ration across 4 party members effectively.
9.  The Playtesters universally want 1D100 for Skills rather than a unified 1D20 for Skill/Trait/Resource (2D10 fills Trait/Resource now) because it feels better on the mental math (They know exactly % of success rather than X/20 success). This surprised me, but is totally fine and a minor adjustment.
10. It turns out, *Pendragon* really hits something special. But that is *special for particular people because it drives character actions;* the Play-testers *really* liked having a set of Traits that they could **try** to call upon to juice their Skill Checks, as well as how Traits then also become a driver for a *wide* variety of Conditions without having to be a distinct mechanical *thing*. This continued into Audiences and beyond, where a Play-Tester felt that Role-Play was 'natural' and 'rewarding' by either playing to their base instincts or becoming Conflicted to push their character to 'Stand Up' to the situation despite a penalty on Skills. (This was honestly better than I'd expected, and they really dug into it and found it freeing in the sense they could approach 'how to play' their character in a more sensible way from what they reported.""
11. Other various adjustments through the month (self or player noted):
   1. Bows were given an adjustment: Hunting Bow is -1D6 Damage, but Long Bow is full Weapon Damage at higher range but slower fire rate. This actually had no impact in the Playtest, but was a consistency adjustment.
   2. Professions in Character Creation now provide a +10% Skill increase, rather than +5% as before. This is a self imposition based on the first session this month, to give players a wider boost and diversity of Skills they naturally consider... \*hurk\*... *viable*.
      1. This means the average Profession takes about 7 terms (28 years) to '*max out*' in the chargen process. So You'll be 43 and kinda sad about it, which is perfect.
   3. A Player can now ""buy"" an Apprenticeship in a Career Path during Chargen!
      1. By spending 1 Wealth, a character can take 1 Term in a Career Path (of their preferred Profession, or focus) as normal. Each subsequent Term in that Career/Profession requires either a Difficult Apprenticeship Check to stay in or 1 Wealth to 'buy' another term.
      2. The Playtesters unanimously agreed this is a super fun idea, since it gives a background aspect ('Ah yes, well... My *father* was quite well connected, you know') and comes with a **hard** opportunity cost: having even a few points of Wealth was determined to be significantly impactful, so sacrificing Wealth to gain some Skills and get Older is a big decision. But it allows someone who has **a pure vision of their character** to kinda 'force' that vision to fruition. Which is, honesty, a great idea and I love it.

TL;DR:

This was a great playtest! Overall, I seem to have hit **at or near the mark** of my intent in *most of my goals* that have been tested so far. Play-testers, primarily D&D5e and PF1/2E players, found the *vast majority* of **The Hero's Call** was a fun experience, felt good to play, and gave them some excitement! There are some things the smooth-out (Mainly Travel), some PDF clarity to provide (Give a Pre-Amble section that gives a Player-Hero a heads up of what Skills help with Which Thing), and some perceptive confusion about the scale of Combat (although that will be continuously tested to make it right).

There is going to be an additional Playtest in (hopefully) two months or so, but I have enough notes and *corrections* based on feedback to create my RED ORC (REference Document, ORC License) and re-compile **this playtest** into what will likely be the *Starter Set/Convention Package*. Between the two, probably the Latter!

For those that have questions and curiosities, feel free to leave comments! I'm heading to sleepytime, but will response fully (and as clearly I as I can try to be!) when I awake and have coffee!"

I have 130 MASTERY ON SHYVANA and tried every build, Eclipse kinda broken  to par with Shvyana's E passive \(hp base damage\) and for cheap item with 60 AD and 15 haste, what else? The item path is good too. If ur ahead, and u think u can get the feast, upgrade to ionian boots 2nd item, and if not stick to magical boots the go for Sundered Sky then back to finish ionian or any defensive boots of ur choice. \(Anything will do\) But of u have the feast, massive upgrade for ionian boots could get u 25 haste and the MS for every skillshots u do for 4seconds. \(upgraded ionian makes u kite out \(fire E on them u can have ms to out or chase\). Next should be Titanic Hydra and make sure to build first the Tiamat after 3 items so u can maximize ur Q output and SS damage. 4th item could be optional base on the comp of their team, if u think u need MR, go VISAGE for healing and barrier increased by 25&#37; for ur Eclipse and SS. Again another cheap item but great value. Havent gone to full item as u can see on my 9 win streak, but again, very optional. If they dont have AP champ, then go any HP base item to maximize ur Titanic hydra. Again, very optional base on ur game but the core would be Eclipse, SS, TitanicHydra.](https://preview.redd.it/0vaakomqm3fe1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae9a190f11dbaea5c85c953d934b590047fcf6b4)

  
PS. Another Why Eclipse? 2900 gold item that u can get before those meta jg who build 3K+ gold item makes u turn around 1v1 fight EVEN you dont have a kill u can still be ahead finishing first item.

[Standard PTA Runes and keystones. Secondary, you can do whatever u want but personally want the magical boots and extra early gold on triple tonic so if u lose scutler early game, u can still buy good components, having pickaxe with a pinkwards early is a must for a full clear jungler. Reaching level 6 and contest for the grubs or drake with Elixir of Force was like having another item with that fight.](https://preview.redd.it/omedrvirm3fe1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7d68b4908d467a420211bf8089af563f87d310)

MAXING Q first cause this build is AD only and doesnt have AS components. Max E second so u can still poke hard and the Elixir of Skill will help you get free skill point on ur E btw thats why I love triple tonic.

He helped me make the mountains 

So i decided to take after a comment by u/Fl00d to make a biomes map then i said why not add mountains and rivers?

So those are the two new maps

Biomes:

Red: savannah 

Yellow: desert (duh)

Gray: tundra 

Dark green: jungle

Green: like the birch forest biomes in Minecraft 

Olive green: like the Mediterranean biomes irl

Purple:swamps and bog etc

Light green: well get in that later ;)

So first off political events:

Vos(dark red):as more and more scouts were getting bit by the hornts
And the cold of winter fading

The emperor expanded his empire upwards and is currently heading west  but something halted the expansion 

When the first victims of the hornts became well and good they started to worship the bugs that gave them power basically making a cult

But when the winter ended the bugs disappeared fading back to unrelavence 

The cult took it as the gods anger 

As even when they got the powers they still served the light haired  emperor 

So one day as a guard was gathering the scouts 

One of them lunged at the guard and took his sword using the magic he has

This signalled the revolt
Chaos everywhere guards pleading for help

The overseer of the guard hurried to find a messenger to alert the emperor 

All the messengers are killed 

The overseer runs out of the camp

Leaving the west of the empire to chaos

He hurried to the emperor pleading to stop the riot

The emperor shock on his face ordered an attack on the rioters with all the empires might



Half survived...




Now the west of vos is left to the cult
With the emperor holding his ground in the strait between the continents of the west....  




Down in a river bed a tribe of crocodiles civilise making huts in the river doing nothing most of the time just chillin they call their empire: damemir


In The termites empire:

It is a dark and gloomy day

The feeder of the poor ihop is dead the provider of food to the poor is gone 

He died in his sleep peacefully as he rightfully deserved

Instability rises in the areas around the IHOP 

Rumors spred that the emperor sent assassins to get rid of ihop 

Instability in the termites increases




The axolotls: the spihs tribe of the axolotls stumble across a giant wall of rock it is angled with varying peaks and while exploring they find a shiny rock it is like the colour of copper they bring it back to the werc
Tribe because they are the brains of the two
They find it very good at bonking people.

Another thing happened to the axolotls

On a day of kāne kā looked dimmer....

It isn't noticeable but kā is dimmer 


Now onto the light green biome

On the day when kā got dimmer a roofed forest appeared as some citizens of the termites say: very tall/roofed/and something is inside 


Giant...... Not even the boto and joraka dare to go in

HP as a stat has become the best stat after being very bad for so long. This what makes people frustrated.,leagueoflegends,1i9gfy8,2025-01-25 00:53:51,7,0.63,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1i9gfy8/hp_as_a_stat_has_become_the_best_stat_after_being/,Lopsided_Chemistry89,,"Greetings!

There are many posts talking about tanks/HP and why should anti-HP tools return to the game again. I disagree. HP was and is a defensive stat for tanks/fighters to feel durable and shouldn't be used as a damage modifier vs them in most games. For instance the Giant Slayer + Cutdown combo used to deal 32.25% more damage not just 30% (1.15\*1.15) vs high HP enemies, but this is not my point.

What is annoying about HP now? IMO it's the versatility of the stat and it being a scaling modifier for many many things especially with the high HP numbers now. For example 

* HP now has a way to deal a burst of damage through Heartsteel and gain more max HP.
* It provides shields through Steraks.
* It provides damage and heals with Unending Despair.
* It gives very good wave clear with Hollow Radiance.
* It can give AD or AP based on the bonus HP with Overlords Bloodmail/Rift Maker.
* Tier 3 boots scale with bonus HP too.
* Kaenic Rookern scales with HP.
* On hit damage with Titanic hydra.
* Burning Aura with Sunfire.

These effects were present for long time and were not an issue i agree, but when the HP in many items is 500+ or 900 in case of Heartsteel it starts to make these health scaling numbers scale harder.

Again I don't mind HP being a defensive stat mainly (because it's the purpose of the rune), but when it comes to wave clear, burst damage, sustained damage, and other forms of damage that turn anyone into a K'sante-like champion that stack defense but deal a lot of damage it become frustrating.

I know that they want tanks to have a threat and can't be ignored. But can we rely on their kits in the gameplay? for example a Cho'gath who has to hit Q>W>E>R should be the fighting pattern people face not the Heartsteel>E>R with some AOE procs of Hollow radiance/Unending Despair.

In case of other stats like AD/AP/AH/mana/AS/armor/MR/MS/crit they all serve their purpose. Rarely they give a niche thing outside their use for example AD increasing Maw's shield or DD's heal. And most of the AD scaling that buffs the damage in items was removed and was replaced by flat numbers.

Again, I don't want HP to return into being very irrelevant stat that makes you vulnerable to certain runes/items, but rather return to it's original form of HP that makes you harder to die.

In conclusion. I think the HP problem is that it has a very high HP number to make the user tanky (which is good for the game), but the HP scaling in most items should be tuned down or replaced with a flat number per level to put a limit to them like how other stats in other items work. They still feel like playing the items not the champion when most tanks run Heartsteel>Unending Despair to play the ""bonk and drain"" gameplay."

"""Tom & Jerry"" (2021) has more creative fan-service than many other adaptations.",TomAndJerry,1i9f4da,2025-01-24 23:32:58,38,0.93,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9f4da,Vegetable-Quote-3481,Question,"""Tom & Jerry"" (2021) features a handful of references to the original cartoons. However, I think the nods in here were done in good taste.

The callbacks weren't in-your-face and they had a level of creativity. The movie re-imagines these elements and gives them a completely new vision seamlessly integrated into the story and interactions that allows them to actually stand on their own.

Especially as the film even takes many great creative liberties with its source material, like its creative perspective on the ""Tom and Jerry"" world as this vibrant and cool unorthodox setting where humans and cartoon animals co-exist and obey their own rules, the movie's care and handling with the material makes them feel earned.

For example, when Tom acted like a mouse, it may remind fans of ""Nit-Witty Kitty"" (1951). However, the movie doesn't simply rehash these references without context. Instead of bonking Tom on the head, this was a way for Tom to communicate that Jerry was wrecking havoc. It's completely in-line with Tom's personality and the silly charm behind visual comedy.

Compared to so many other adaptations guilty of providing nothing beyond overwhelming nods chosen purely for nostalgia bait, this feels like it's in a whole other league. This is fan-service when done correctly."

This time i will blatantly run through the game with a big bonk or ape arms and I'm not afraid to push into wayy into cheating territory with additional mods. I want to become the god of absolute strength

E.g. more cyberware capacity, more slots for sandy, more skillpoints, more everything. 

I saw somewhere there is a sandy overhaul mod that basically lets you stop time at some point - whats that called?

Otherwise what do you recommend? "

A Guide to Piloting,outerwilds,1i99hso,2025-01-24 18:40:15,15,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/comments/1i99hso/a_guide_to_piloting/,gliesedragon,Base Game Appreciation/Discussion,"So, you're having trouble with your spaceship. Maybe it's landing, maybe it's the autopilot ""acting up,"" maybe it's that you keep lithobraking at an unsurvivable 600 m/sec. Whatever it is, it's likely annoying. So, if you're about ready to rage at the controls, or confused as to why things aren't acting like you expect them to, here's a bit of an in-depth guide to how the ship works, piloting in a way that's a bit less lethal, and otherwise learning why it's doing what it's doing. If you want a brisker overview, the final section of this post (Long Story Short) is a quick set of piloting bullet points.

The basic deal is that the physics of spaceflight in *Outer Wilds* is not at all like most games with flight or spaceships: it's running on Newtonian mechanics, mostly. If you're expecting a cartoon airplane, you're going to get a bit tangled.

This guide will have no specific reference to any locations in the game: only the spaceship's toolkit, basic generalities about how planets work in general, and that the sun exists. 

# The tools at your disposal

Let's start with a run-down of things that your ship has. It has a lock-on reticle, a match velocity function, an autopilot, and a downwards-facing landing cam. And, it also has a signalscope and scout launcher. Except for the autopilot and landing cam, all of these tools are also on your space suit.

The lock-on reticle shows quite a bit. If you're approaching a target, it's blue, receding, it's red, and lateral motion is shown as little arrows: up/down and left/right have different arrows, and the length corresponds to how much you're moving in that direction relative to the target. Also, it's got your exact relative radial velocity as a number: good for knowing how much you need to slow down.

The maximum thrust on the ship is about 50 m/sec^(2), which basically means that firing the engines for one second changes your velocity by 50 m/sec. So, if you need to slow down from 300 m/sec, you'll need about 6 seconds to do that.

The impact tolerance of the ship is also quite good: as a quick rule of thumb, any landing where your velocity relative to your target is 30 m/sec or so isn't going to scratch the paint, and the damage from harder landings can be fixed.

# Basic Theory

The thing with spaceflight in *Outer Wilds* is that you're at the whims of Newtonian mechanics, rather than standard video game physics. At its most basic, this means that velocities are additive, rather than a new heading replacing the other.

Let's say that, rather than being in the solar system, you're on a flat grid. You're moving north, and want to be moving east, instead. So, you fire your rockets so you get an impulse eastward . . . and you're moving northeast. You've added eastward motion to your nothward path. If you wanted to go directly east, you'd need to cancel out your northward velocity by firing south as well as east.

And then, there's orbital mechanics. Don't worry if they're unintuitive, the early astronauts who tried out the first real-world spaceship rendezvous maneuvers had issues with that as well. The only real way to get a handle on them is to try for yourself: experimenting gives you a feel for things.

The big, wonky thing about orbits is that lower orbits are faster, but you have to add speed to get to a higher orbit. So, let's say you're trying to catch up with a satellite that's ahead of you in the same orbit: if you go faster to catch up, you'll boost into a higher, slower, orbit and it'll drift further ahead. So, to catch it, you have to do the counterintuitive thing and slow down: this drops you into a lower, faster orbit and you can catch it.

# The Autopilot

The thing is, you'll rarely have to deal with orbits, because your ship probably has enough power to go directly to your target. The thing is, sometimes you go a bit too directly, and bonk at lethally ludicrous speeds. And the simplest way to (mostly) avoid that is to use the autopilot. Not just as a transit method, though: it uses the easiest method of getting from planet to planet, and so it's a decent teacher.

The autopilot on your ship is a simple thing, but, it's a really good tool for seeing how to fly from one planet to another. Basically, it's trying for a simple brachistochrone trajectory, which gets to its target in the minimum time. Watch how it works (and how it doesn't): it'll teach you some of the basics.

First, it cancels out all lateral velocity relative to the target: if you just pointed directly where you wanted to go, you might end up off course because of that lateral velocity. And then, after it's done that, it starts you accelerating to your destination.

And then, about halfway through your flight, it starts burning in the opposite direction. This is important: if you didn't, you'd reach your target at frankly absurd speeds, and either fly past or (more likely) crash. The amount of reverse thrust you need to decelerate will be about as much as you needed to get going that fast in the first place: there is no friction in space, after all.

Now, as great as it is, the autopilot has a couple of downsides. First and most obviously, it has no object avoidance. If you want to go somewhere that's currently behind the sun, it'll cheerfully oblige you. A dollop of situational awareness should help with that. The second issue is that planetary orbits are circles, which means their velocities change over time: this means that you'll generally be a little bit away from the your target planet, and the error is more severe for planets close to the sun.

Luckily, you can abort an autopilot plan mid-flight, if necessary. Then, you do your evasive maneuvers and can get back to business.

# Landing and On-planet Navigation

So, you've mostly gotten somewhere, but you're still in space and would rather be on solid ground. Luckily, your piloting or the autopilot will generally get you close enough to a planet that its gravity will pull you in automatically. Less luckily, you'll generally end up falling a bit too fast to land undamaged.

To get to the ground safely, your biggest assets will be matching velocity and your landing camera. Your ship has enough acceleration to beat the gravity on any planet in the solar system, and so you can match velocity with the planet you're falling towards and just stop. And the landing camera shows what's directly beneath you, so you can choose somewhere relatively flat to land. As I've said before, you don't need to be particularly gentle when landing: 30 m/sec probably won't break anything.

Of course, once you're on a planet, you might want to be somewhere else on the planet. To do this, my general advice is to go upwards briefly, then use longer bursts of lateral thrust: this means you're a bit less likely to end up back in space. This is easier to practice in places with higher gravity: on a planet with low gravity, going on foot might be more practical.

# Long Story Short

\-Changing direction adds to your original one, it doesn't replace it.

\-Remember to slow down ahead of time: friction won't do it for you when it's not there.

\-Match velocity is the most useful control in spaceflight.

\-The autopilot is reasonably reliable, but requires a bit of awareness.

\-You don't need to be gentle when landing.

\-Orbits are weird.

\-You've got a lot of tools at your disposal: don't forget to mess with them.

\-Everyone will have their particularly silly piloting mishaps.

\-Oh yeah, the thing you fix when the reactor is broken is in the ship, behind the pilot's seat and opposite the slot with your spacesuit. Just in case."

1. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that pay tribute to memes, celebrities, animals and viral internet trends.
2. Successful memecoin trading requires thorough research to avoid scams, careful evaluation of community strength and liquidity factors, and adherence to best practices for risk management.
3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins 💻

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke. 

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars’ worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they’re highly volatile — even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them. 

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins 📍

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge), [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe) do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/) and [Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

# How to trade memecoins on centralized crypto exchanges 📝

As touched on above, Kraken boasts a wide selection of popular memecoins, which can be traded just as easily as any other asset. You can perform direct cash-to-crypto swaps in a few clicks, or set up more advanced orders (such as [recurring buys](https://www.kraken.com/learn/finance/dollar-cost-averaging) or [limit orders](https://www.kraken.com/learn/trading/trade-orders)) with ease.

# Key considerations for memecoin trading 🧐

As with any investment, [doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor) is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that **memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers — taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it’s easy for bad actors to ‘astroturf’ on social media — making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you’ll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength. 

An example of a potential red flag is an [LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens) that hasn’t been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide, [How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like [Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/) or [Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/) can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:** a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:** take a look at the project’s Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:** as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn’t, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:** can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading 📚

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders. 

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable. 

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading 📖

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that **the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space — ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

trying to find a replacement for sunshot,DestinyTheGame,1i8x96p,2025-01-24 09:57:56,0,0.31,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1i8x96p/trying_to_find_a_replacement_for_sunshot/,LetterIntelligent414,Question,"hello. i hope some knowledgeable guardians can help me here. i know far too little about d2 to understand some posts ive read so i wanted to ask instead:

im running a solar titan build with ashen wake exotic gauntlets (please tell me if you have other recommendations for exotic armor. ive read synthoscepts or loreleys splendor but i like spamming grenades so i went for ashen wake) for a lot of grenades and going for hammer bonks, quick cooldowns and damage tank. since sol invictus creates sunspots from scorched enemies, additionally to my abilities im trying to find a weapon with incandescent so i can proc sunspot from afar too. 
sunshot does scorch but it seems it just explodes every enemy that gets scorched so it never activates. ive tried ammit ar2 with incandescent and it does work but i really like the feel of sunshot and how it explodes all enemies, id just like sunshot to create sunspots on top. also i really like handcannons. ive read zaoulis bane is like a craftable sunshot kinda since you can put incandescent and some explosion perk at the same time. would zaoulis explode enemies + create sunspots? 
going for a legendary would also free up my exotic slot for my trusty mida multitool or bad juju. 

if zaoulis doesnt do that i will definetly keep sunshot and wave sunspots from afar goodbye. in that case does anyone have a recommendation for a legendary scout or pulse rifle that sits in the kinetic spot and is good? i also thought about using a shotgun that sits in the kinetic slot since im melee almost all the time anyway. are there any good kinetic shotguns? 

tldr:

- i have a titan solar build
- is ashen wake good for exotic or should i go with something else and why?
- is zaoulis bane like sunshot in that it explodes enemies but would allow me to create sunspots too with sol invictus?
- do you have any kinetic weapons recs for shotgun, pulse rifle and scout rifle?
- any other tips for my build? 

thank you so much for every answer.

I know there's supposed to be nothing in the crib for safe sleep but the only solution I can think of for this problem is using crib bumpers or a liner. Does anyone use these products?

In a significant move, the SEC has launched a new crypto task force aimed at setting a sensible regulatory path for the cryptocurrency industry. Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as ""crypto mom"" for her supportive stance on crypto innovation, this task force marks a shift from the previous enforcement-heavy approach to clearer regulation and guidance[3].

Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has hinted at the possibility of delisting Tether's USDT if it fails to comply with upcoming U.S. regulations. The potential new rules could require stablecoin issuers to back their tokens entirely with U.S. Treasury bonds and undergo periodic audits. Armstrong emphasized Coinbase's commitment to compliance and helping users transition to more secure assets[1][5].

In other news, President-elect Donald Trump has launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, which saw its market capitalization soar to several billion dollars shortly after its launch. Despite initial skepticism, the coin's popularity has been fueled by announcements on Trump's official social media channels. However, experts caution against the speculative nature of meme coins[2].

On the legislative front, the new administration is expected to work with Congress on stablecoin and market structure reforms, further defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC in crypto regulations. A crypto council is also in the works to develop new regulatory policies, making 2025 a pivotal year for the crypto space[3].

In corporate news, Circle has acquired Hashnote for an undisclosed amount, and Solana's stablecoin supply has seen a 60% increase since Friday. Justin Sun has outlined a plan to push Ethereum to $10,000, and Jupiter is set to airdrop $630 million in JUP tokens. Bitcoin miners are enjoying tripled profit margins, and BTC mining has reportedly saved Texas $18 billion[3].

Riot Platforms is pivoting to AI data centers, and CLS Global has pleaded guilty to wash trading. CryptoCom has relaunched its US exchange, and KULR has bought another $8 million in BTC. Finland has launched its first-ever crypto ETPs, and the banking industry, led by BofA CEO, is ready to embrace crypto[3].

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, MicroStrategy shareholders have approved more BTC purchases, and Rex Shares has filed for ETFs related to $TRUMP, DOGE, and BONK. A Texas court has reversed sanctions on Tornado Cash, and there are plans to converge traditional finance and crypto, according to the Financial Times[3].

CMV: Being conservative is bad,changemyview,1i8tfxr,2025-01-24 06:37:39,0,0.45,211,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i8tfxr/cmv_being_conservative_is_bad/,Head-Succotash9940,Delta(s) from OP,"I don’t identify with any political ideology and don’t really care in general. But with last years massive amount of elections and many countries shifting to one side or the other I can’t help but be bothered when people say they’re “conservative” and proud of it.

Being conservative is bad and no one should be proud to be conservative cmv.

“Consevative” in the dictionary means:

1. averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values.

2. (in a political context) favouring free enterprise, private ownership, and socially traditional ideas.

So basically being conservative means you re agains progress (progressive being the opposite) and hold traditional ideas, supporting things being done the way they’ve always been done because, well that’s how it’s always been done. It seems to me like saying: “Im conservative” is the same as saying “I’m dumb and afraid of new things”.

If conservatives had always been in charge we would still be in caves and the progressives who wanted to make fire in would be shunned and probably bonked over the head for suggesting such nonsense.

One example of conservatives being in charge is the church and the “Dark Ages” when there was very little if any cultural and scientific advancement in Europe. Another is everyone who doubted travel by train because the human body couldn’t travel that fast, doubters of the Wright brothers, people who still believe the moon landing wasn’t possible, even still people who hold racist and bigoted ideas about new/different cultures and identities. These people are dumb, ignorant and conservative and should be ashamed to be. Maybe some conservatives can shed light on this for me and CMV?"

LOUDLY, we could literally hear them through the walls. We'd hear them argue every month or every few weeks or something so not regularly. But last night was probably the worst fight. So i was staying up a bit later bc my parents were away for a few hours and i was working on a birthday gift for a friend while watching slmccl until i heard faint yelling and paused the video i was watching. I could faintly hear my neighborgs argue, it was probably around ten that night and the argueing seemed to intensify to the point that my olest brother(20, m) who we'll call J, went to my middle brother(17, who we'll call Z) because i think he was worried/scared. Z reassured J that he'd handle it(J is disabled so Z is more of the eldest than J) After a while and one more time of J going to Z, Z called our dad that the neighbors were arguieng worse than they usually do. At this point my neighbors(f and m in dating, getting married in june i think) were yelling, shouting, screaming and possible throwing things(we're not sure since we can only hear yelling, shouting, screaming, bonking, banging(like throwing objects you dirty minded person) and stomping stairs) But eventually things settled down and my dad returned home. And that was basically it, thanks for reading :) (and no we will not call the police unless it gets really concerning like screaming for help, we don't want to cause trouble or get anyone false arrested/accused)"
