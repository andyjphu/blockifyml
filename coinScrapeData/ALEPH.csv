TA Guide - Easy wins with campaign staples (+Re'vas),WH40KTacticus,1i9469p,2025-01-24 14:47:35,7,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WH40KTacticus/comments/1i9469p/ta_guide_easy_wins_with_campaign_staples_revas/,KarmaVault_,Guide,"I dislike TA - the anxiety of facing off against a live opponent, for me, is way worse than the satisfaction of outplaying them. And as a new player, it feels shitty to lose to teams of legendaries when I don't have a single one (Abaddon doesn't count :P). But the (energy) rewards are so good that I always feel obligated to go for the final chest. And winning always feels better than losing. 

This season, I'm 30-4 in Common with some campaign staples, and since I didn't see a lot of guides on this topic, I thought I'd share my experience with them for anybody still struggling for that final chest:

Re'vas,  Calandis,  Boss G,  Thaddeus,  Aleph-Null,  Forgefiend

I think this is a solid roster that is particularly good in Infested Power-Ups: it can take power-ups, deny them to the enemy, and has decent sustain against the hordes.

**Re'vas**: everyone knows how good her overwatch is at making space, although I think most people agree she's not quite the TA god she used to be. She's still unmatched in area denial, and even when countered, I feel like it usually takes more resources to deal with her (suppression, forgefiend primary, plus 2-3 solid hits). If she isn't countered, she provides a safe shelter for the rest of the squad to position. 

I almost always beelined toward the center on turn 1 and set up her active, either claiming a power-up or 2 spaces away from another power-up, threatening it. Of course, infiltrators (cough Mataneo), Celestine, and suppression (Thaddeus, Azrael, but not very common) make this more tricky, so in those cases I'll be more conservative with positioning my squishier characters, assuming OW will be nullified. I still won an embarrassing number of matches to opponents suiciding their characters into the OW, either on accident or hubris. 

She also helps provide a soft win condition in close matches: in a 2v2, Re'vas and Aleph can fly away and sustain each other while the horde takes small bites out of the opponents. I'll sometimes use her melee to ignite a tile to enable Forgefiend to attack an enemy character; otherwise she usually doesn't do much damage after Turn 2.

**Calandis**: amazing at picking up power-ups on razor wire using her active, and it feels amazing when you manage to snag a damage or hits power-up, shoot, then immediately reposition onto a second power-up. Has synergy if Boss G pops his active right next to her and gives her an extra two hexes of movement. Fragile though, and usually a priority target for opponents, especially if powered up. I never relied on her OW, since the hordes usually pop it. 

**Boss G**: usually MVP of the team, provides reach and damage with active, especially great for punishing overextended characters. Good opponents will position just out of reach (4 hexes). Since Re'vas almost always provides center control Turn 1-2, I park him aggressively up next to her and generally get off a solid active the next turn. Consider parking Aleph adjacent the turn before you plan on popping his active. 

**Thaddeus**: he did some decent work suppressing enemy Re'vas, but I didn't see them all that often. To be honest, I kinda wish I had Sho'syl to use instead, but Thaddeus still did a good job of popping shields and providing consistent long-ranged damage. It was rare for him to survive to Turn 3-4 (and anyways often the game is decided before then) but the charge-up on his active is a decent clock to have, and is tempting to use on clustered groups. Definitely keep him as far from harm's way as possible. 

**Aleph-Null**: decent upfront burst with scarabs, but don't rely on them further than that. Could probably be flexed for another mobile/tanky melee like Godswyl or Mataneo (but I don't have either). But he flies and is a priority recipient for the health power-up, which makes him into a win condition **IF** he survives and both teams are down to 1-2 characters, especially if Re'vas also survives. Can also heal Boss G in a slugfest. I have won quite a few matches which were overrun by tyrannids, fires everywhere from Forgefiend, with Aleph sustaining himself. 

**Forgefiend**: best MoW, period. Shuts down Abraxas, clears Re'vas drones, scarabs, ork boys, etc. Fire area denial can sometimes outright win games by keeping power-up'd enemy melee at bay away from their team. 

The usual flow of games is: turn 1, grab any power-ups within easy reach, overwatch Re'vas. If the opponent can deal with OW (suppress, infiltrate), position everybody else further back; if not, then everybody up front.  Sometimes when going second, you can take down an overextended character on turn 1. Next turn, focus down 1-2 priority targets, usually using Boss G active. I only had a couple of opponents hang back in a ball and wait for me to approach them, most of them rushed in or split their team around the center, both of which are easily dispatched.

I lost to an Exitor-Rho mech team (wasn't even mad, it started with Rho slipping next to my overwatched Re'vas and went downhill from there), a Kharn team, one Ragnar wombo combo, and one other team I forget.

Good luck to you all out there! Would love to other peoples' thoughts about the team and strategy"

However, if I want to become a teacher here (extremely difficult I know but I intend to stay and have a future in Valencia with my fiancé who is Valencian) then I need a C1 in Valencian and Spanish. So, I was hoping to attend a Spanish language school to build up my skills. I've been looking at schools but does anyone have any personal experience with any language schools here, in particular Route 66, Ele Aleph and El Carmen? I know there's reviews online but I know reviews can be bought and most reviews aren't very detailed. I also can't go to an EOI because I need at least 20 hours a week.

Also if anyone knows where I can study Valencian for a few hours every week please let me know! I live in an area affected by DANA and my Escola d'Adults is no longer running the Valencian class I used to attend. Thank you very much! 

Hola, soy extranjera y quiero estudiar un máster en educación secundaria aquí.  Pero, si quiero ser profesora aquí (ya lo sé que es difícil pero quiero un futuro aquí con mi novio valenciano) necesito un C1 en valenciano y castellano. Así que, ¿alguien tiene experiencia personal con una escuela de lenguas aquí, especialmente Route 66, Ele Aleph y El Carmen? Hay reseñas en línea pero sé que puedes comprarlas y las reseñas son muy similares. También, no puedo ir a la EOI porque necesito estudiar por 20 horas o más. 

También, si alguien sabe dónde puedo estudiar valenciano durante un poco todas las semanas dime por favor. Es que vivo en uno de los pueblos afectados por DANA y mi Escola d’Adults y ya no dan la clase de valenciano a la que asistía. ¡Muchas gracias! "

I accidentally beat Apoc Bird,LobotomyCorp,1i7at11,2025-01-22 08:13:14,30,0.98,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LobotomyCorp/comments/1i7at11/i_accidentally_beat_apoc_bird/,Hazed_Person2908,Gameplay,"You read the spoilers tag, right? This post may contain spoilers pertaining to a boss fight—Apocalypse Bird.







I just wanted to share a shocking experience that happened to me today. 

So, I wanted to see if I could suppress every abnormality in my facility if they ever breached all at once using >!Flesh Idol (I sacced one employee because I don't have the button)!<. I was pretty confident in my skills and even started a suppression plan on how I'm going to get things done. The thing is, I didn't noiced that I have the >!three birds, so I ended up doing Apocalypse Bird!< (that I wanted to do later on in the game; it was Day 27, still a pretty small facility). Obviously, with the Third Trumpet blaring, I tried to reconsider my decisions. Though, I still went ahead with the day and just thought I could restart.

My original plan was to blob every employee at an elevator in Asiyah and comb out abnormalities one-by-one, top-to-bottom. What happened instead was that I had to adjust, >!I grouping all of my employees into four groups of different damage types for the eggs!<. I eliminated all the threats in Asiyah and waited for Apoc Bird to spawn. 

When Apoc Bird spawned, my first instinct was to pause and analyze the situation—but, as I now realize, >!Long Arm removes your ability to pause (and change time?).!< I wasn't going completely blind here though. I knew what >!eggs absorb which damage!< so I sent >!White damage and Pale Damage to Big Eyes!< and rest to >!Long Arm!<. I had a few ALEPH set so this made it easier. Once >!Big Eyes and Long Arm!< was destroyed, >!their abilities finally wore off!< and I can finish off >!Small Beak!<.

After that, I ended the day as quickly as I could, and that is how I got the Twilight E.G.O set (the gift is pretty cool too). To be honest, it felt like a breeze, maybe only as hard as Gebura; or is that because I hadn't attempted Apoc Bird's suppression blindly? I mean, we're exposed to spoilers every now and then. 

Additional Question: >!My departments (which has Meltdown Immunity from Core Suppression) had a meltdown on it during Apoc Bird suppression. Which egg triggered this? It caused the previously recontained abnormalities to breach again—I was too hyperfocused on defeating Apoc Bird I didn't bother to send people to the containment units.!<"
A beginning.,KingkillerChronicle,1i6vq6c,2025-01-21 17:46:44,22,0.96,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1i6vq6c/a_beginning/,TacticalDo,Discussion,"Decided to clean up the detailed timeline I previously constructed for 'The Price of Remembering.' Some basic rules with the logic employed here, Pat is not likely to have constructed any simple, moustache twirling villains, each party would consider themselves justified. Skarpi and Denna’s accounts are just different perspectives of the same events, and the actual truth falls somewhere in between.

**5000 + years ago**

* The Ruarch, a race of immortal beings exist and some among them can Name (*Referenced by Skarpi NotW Chpt 28*). This is before Men, and Fae exist and these Namers/Old Knowers walk Temerant like tiny gods. They are the founders of the Ergen Empire. (*Confirmed by Pat and in Felurian WMF Chpt 102*)
* Iax Lackless (*Later ‘of the dark and changing eye’ and Kvothe’s Ancestor*) develops the art of Shaping. He and his fellow Shapers then go on to create the Fae realm. (*Confirmed in Felurian WMF Chpt 102*)
* Iax (*Unverified, referenced only as ‘a man’*) visits ‘the Lady’ from ‘How Old Holly Came To Be’, he sings to her, and shows her the art of Shaping, invites her to come and live with him in the Fae realm and she accepts. (*side note: Hespe’s tale references Jax owning a flute, so some musical prowess is present*)
* At some stage Humanity (*Felurian’s referenced Men*), and those of the Fae are shaped into being. (*Inferred from Felurian WMF Chpt 102*)
* Iax and ‘The Lady’ marry, and she becomes Lady Lackless/Luckless (*Unverified, but highly likely as a woman would be needed to continue the Lackless line.*)
* The Namers/Old Knowers become angry, thinking Iax and the other Shapers are going too far. (*Verified in* *Felurian WMF Chpt 102*)
* The Lady confronts Iax - possibly over his creations - and they fall out, she then leaves The Fae and returns to Temerant. Makes a wreath of holly, which I believe in this context is a ward against skin dancers, something Iax has created or become. (*Inferred from How Old Holly Came To Be*)
* Iax speaks to the Ctheah/Selitos, who teaches him how he might steal the moon, pulling it into the Fae. (*This is the Listener referenced in Hespe’s story, Selitos before he is bound to the tree by Tehlu/Chandrian*) *(Confirmed by Bast in WMF Chpt 86)*
* Using Selitos’s/Cthaeh’s advice Iax tries to pull the moon into the Fae and half succeeds - Why did Selitos/Ctheah advise Iax to do this? He wanted to incite the war. Why did he want to incite the war? So he could sit it out in Myr Tariniel and rule over the remnants? (*confirmed in Skarpi’s tale that they had peace in Myr Tariniel, in the high mountains likely in Northern Vintas far from the early Creation war, a place the Chandrian considered a ‘Warren’.*) *(Verified in* *Felurian WMF Chpt 102 and referenced in Hespe’s tale in WMF Chpt 86 with Jax/Iax’s conversation with The Listener.)*
* The partial theft of the moon is the final catalyst that sparks the Creation war, with the Old Knowers attacking first. The Shapers/Proud Dreamers/of the Dark and Changing Eye vs the Namers/Old Knowers/of the Bright and Shining Eye. (*Verified by Felurian WMF Chpt 102*)
* Iax and the proud dreamers Shape weapons of war, creating creatures such as Durruna, Scrael, Skin Dancers, Draccusi, and Gremmen (*Inferred from the Atas reading of Finol)*. They then cross over from the Fae to invade Temerant. (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*)
* The Old Knowers start losing, in their desperation they draw humanity into the fight, directing the attacks of Iax onto them. (*Unverified - Alternative could be that humanity had already sided with the Old Knowers.*)
* The Adem before they were of Ademre were a mix of Shapers/Namers they split around this point and stopped Shaping. (*Referenced in Aethe’s Ninety Nine tales, and based on the Atas of Finol that they found the Shapers army.*)
* Iax attacks and destroys hundreds of cities in the Ergen empire over the long centuries. Myr Taraniel is unaffected/unscarred thanks to Selitos and maybe a secret pact with Iax. (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26* *who states that Myr Taraniel’s peace is thanks to Selitos.*)
* Lanre and Lyra fight back against Iax and the Shapers after Iax attacks their home city of Belen, but is foiled. (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*) (*Sidenote Lanre describes Myr Taraniel as a ‘warren’, which can be defined as ‘a maze of passageways or small rooms’, Skarpi also says Lanre and Lyra defended ‘Belen from a surprise attack, saving the city from a foe that should have overwhelmed them.’ Did Iax’s forces get to Belen through a passageway from Myr Tariniel? Likely not, but interesting.*)
* Iax and his forces are pushed back roughly along the great stone road as Lanre unites humanity against the Shapers, making the cities realise their need for allegiance. Allegiance to who though? Possibly Selitos and the Old Knowers? (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*)
* At great cost Humanity and possibly some of the Old Knower Ruarch push the Shapers into a final confrontation with the plan to imprison Iax and his army within a separate possibly shaped realm. (I’m assuming a space disconnected from Temerant/Fae realms based on Felurian’s comment) (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*. *The Flood and door referenced in the Lackless rhymes*)
* After fighting for three days by the light of the sun and moon, Lanre slays Iax’s ‘Great Beast’ at Drossen Tor. (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*) a breath of Iax skin walks into him as he lays dying (*Unverified - Haliax = Hal = Breath/Iax*)
* Iax and his remaining forces are defeated at Drossen Tor and set beyond doors of stone, Lyra (*confirmed from Skarpi’s tale*) and Lady Lackless (*unverified*) are key in this. (*sidenote: Iax and his host could have retreated through a stone door into the Outer Dark - Iax’s home in the Fae - through Farinial, and then locked him behind the Doors of Stone there, but it just seems really convoluted.*) (*Partially* *verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*)
* Lyra pulls the now Iax corrupted Lanre back from beyond the doors of death, speaking his new name, inadvertently making him immortal, as the rest of Iax is alive trapped behind the DoS, so whenever Lanre now dies he is pulled ‘like a lodenstone’ back into the mortal realm. (*Inferred from Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*)
* The Doors of Stone are buried (*Unverified, referenced by Caudicus*) (*sidenote the lackless door/doors of stone is supposedly on the oldest parts of the lackless lands, in old holly she isn't far from her home when the final battle occurs, the location then becomes desolate over time, much like the desert over the other side of the Stormwal. A tor, as in Drossen Tor, is also a large, free-standing rock formation that rises from a hilltop or ridge.*) 
* 8 cities remain as the end of the Creation War draws near (*verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*)
* The Ruarch exert control or fully subjugate humanity. (*Unverified*) Perhaps Selitos with his largely unscathed army conducting this, as he is described by Denna as a ‘Tyrant’. (*Verified in Denna’s song of seven sorrows*)
* Lyra rumoured to be ill, Lyra kidnapped, Lyra died. Lanre at this stage is betrayed I assume by Selitos and the Ruach. (*Verified in Denna’s Song of Seven Sorrows and also by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26 when Lanre says “you have given me enough, old friend.”*). (*Sidenote: Another theory here is that Lyra was pregnant with Iax’s child, but I'm veering away from this as she was at Drossen Tor and fought against Iax.*) Lanre blames himself for Lyra’s death, “her death is on my hands.” (I*mpossible to say exactly how/why she died here, I have previously guessed that Lyra, sent by Lanre went to the Ruach, possibly to Aleph as an emissary for mankind, but was kidnapped and killed.*)
* Corrupted Lanre seeks and obtains knowledge where it is ‘better left alone’ (*there aren't many known options here, it cannot be Selitos/Ctheah because he was confused by Lanre’s sudden power, so likely an unknown party. It is described as ‘hard won’, likely a Faustian bargain with something from beyond the Doors of Death, with the stories of Tarsus actually being of Lanre. Possibly from Iax, but as he is set beyond the Doors of Stone this seems unlikely.*) to bring her back, but he still cannot. (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26)*
* Unable to bring Lyra back, Lanre vows vengeance on the Ruach, Selitos, and the Ergen Empire. (*Inferred, from both Skarpi NotW Chpt 26 and Denna’s Song of Seven Sorrows*)
* Iax corrupted Lanre (*Sidenote: possibly the real Taborlin based on his defeat of King Cyphus.*) convinces 7 other lords/kings, those who had fought beside him during the Creation war, to raise their trusted armies and to destroy the cities of Temerant in order to cast out the Ruach traitors in their midst. One of these lords later backs out at the last minute. (*verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26 and Shehyn’s account.*)
* Lanre confronts Selitos, possibly binding him using Sympathy (*Selitos likely doesn’t consider Lanre a threat here as he is not believed to have any Naming power, and likely has previously pledged allegiance and Selitos doesnt think Lanre knows the Old Knowers/Ergen Empire were responsible for drawing humanity into the creation war.*) (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 26*)
* 7 cities are destroyed. Selitos in his anger binds Lanre to shadow, cursing any who follow him using his own blood. Likely shapes him, makes him more of what he already is, and as it's likely a piece of Iax resides within him, the ruler of the Outer Dark this is how he becomes shadow hamed. (*Confirmed* *by both Skarpi NotW Chpt 26 and Denna’s Song of Seven Sorrows*)
* With the Ergen Empire largely razed, Aleph calls a council of the Ruarch. The Angels/Watchers (*their* *purpose to restore peace by punishing wrongs that they themselves witness*) and the original non-human Amyr (*vengeance on Chandrian for MyrTaranie*l) are formed in response. (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 28*)
* Selitos pledges to punish Haliax and the Chandrian, and under the premise of ‘for the greater good’ he ‘burns down the world’ in pursuit of vengeance. (*Inferred from Skarpi NotW Chpt 26 and in Nel’s description of the Trebon Vase.*)
* The Chandrian, possibly in combination with Tehlu/The Watchers, chase/lure and bind Selitos to a tree in the Fae. (*Inferred in Trapis’s story - Encanis is an amalgamation of the Chandrian and Selitos/Ctheah*) It is actually the Chandrian who use their lives/blood to bind The Ctheah, with only their deaths allowing the binding to be broken. Likely Selitos’s deep name is changed here also, perhaps this is retribution for Lanre having his name changed. (*Unverified*) The Scythe are set so guard, allowing no one near. (*Verified by Bast*) (*Sidenote: I suspect Cinder may have been bitten here, hence the dark eyes, a trait noted as occurring when bitten by the Ctheah.)*
* Due to the curse Haliax and the Chandrian feel pain when their names are spoken. (*Verified by Skarpi NotW Chpt 28*)
* Haliax hopes in time they will be forgotten, only this doesn't happen, and all seems hopeless. (*Unverified*)
* The human Amyr tries to hide the Chandrian’s names, for the greater good, as anyone who finds and speaks their names is subsequently killed. (*Unverified*)

Theories as to what each party wants at this stage:

* Haliax -  To be reunited with Lyra, if this means removing the curse so he can die then this is likely. Or he has truly never swayed from his original purpose which I believe is protecting mankind, which means they are evading death to ensure Selitos/Ctheah remains trapped. (Sidenote: of all the Chandrian does Haliax not actually feel pain when his name is spoken?) Worth noting that Haliax's purpose may now indeed differ from the other Chandran's.
* Chandrian - to be freed from the curse placed upon them by Selitos so they no longer feel pain when their names are spoken. Its been theorised that Cinder was in the Eld searching for the Loeclos box. It could be that whatever is in there holds the key to unlocking the doors of stone and freeing Iax, one of the few potential characters powerful enough to possibly remove the curse.
* Selitos/Ctheah/Original Amyr - To free Selitos. How do the remaining original Amyr do this? Work out where Selitos is, and how he is bound, and break this link. Revenge on whoever trapped Selitos. This was either the Chandrian (they had cause as Selitos was hunting them, ‘burning down the world’ in rebuke of them.) or the Angels/Watchers (They too had cause as they themselves witnessed the crimes Selitos was commiting in search of revenge.)
* Human Amyr - hiding information on the Chandrian, as those who speak their names are killed."
"Mordread, Archangel of ?",cassettebeasts,1i6pfnn,2025-01-21 13:28:06,8,0.75,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cassettebeasts/comments/1i6pfnn/mordread_archangel_of/,V3sperial,,"first of all i would like to apologize for the length of the post and to inform you that i used chatGPT to better organize my thesis, i hope it's not a problem.

From the very beginning of the game, we learn about Mordread, the son of Morgante and Aleph, who was killed by Aleph himself. The DLC sheds more light on this event, but the game doesn’t reveal much about Mordread’s title or potential nature.  
Considering he's the son of the ""Spirit of Rebellion"" and the ""Red King of Conquest"", I’ve theorized that the most fitting title for Mordread would be ""Prince of Revolution."" This idea stems from two key points:  

1) Rebellion and revolution as cycles:
After a rebellion that opposes an established order, and after you conquered your goal and cancelled the old order, a new one must inevitably be built. So the definitions of rebellion, conquest and revolution should be well connected to each other

2)Archangels as manifestations of human desires:  
Archangels are egregores born from human desires. To truly destroy them, one must erase the desire that created them. Aleph killed Mordread not only physically but also symbolically: on the island of New Wirral, the desire for revolution has disappeared. The people have adapted to their situation and lost the drive to change, like leaving the island, especially after the failure of their initial ""revolution"" (the creation and destruction of New London, possibly caused by Helia on the orders of Aleph). This symbolic loss of revolutionary spirit led to Mordread's ""death,"" as the human desire for change no longer exists. When the protagonist begins to threaten the status quo by fighting the archangels, Aleph opposes them because he fears the return of change.  

But why doesn’t Mordread return despite the revolution?
At the end of the game, we achieve what we desire (a way to return home), but there is no true revolution. If we choose to end the game, we leave New Wirral without altering anything within it. If we continue playing, the save file takes us back to before the final choice, leaving everything unchanged. This lack of real change prevents Mordread from ""returning,"" as no revolution has truly taken place.  

This is my theory. idk if someone already wrote something similar and in that case, I'm sorry. I would like to know what you think about it and if it make sense. Thank you for reading!


Edit: Another point supporting my theory could be the role of time. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t specify exactly when Mordread was killed, but we know that the fight between Morgante and Aleph happens around the time our character arrives on New Wirral.  

After something as tragic as the death of her son, it’s unlikely Morgante would have waited long before confronting Aleph. But why would Aleph have waited so long to kill his own son and fight Morgante? The answer might lie in the weakening of the Archangels. Aleph likely had to wait for the desires that created Mordread and Morgante to weaken enough for them to be vulnerable.  

This is also why it makes even more sense that Aleph sabotaged the early settlers’ attempts at rebellion and revolution on New Wirral. By preventing them from fostering a collective desire for change, he ensured that the Archangels tied to those desires—Morgante and possibly Mordread—would lose their strength over time, making them easier to destroy.

Perhaps a group of troubleshooters need to get mission equipment for Friend Computer. Perhaps an adventurer must register their name at the local Adventurer's Guild. Maybe a noble adventurer needs to get insurance. Regardless, bureaucracy is going to have to come and ruin that person's day.

What are some reasons an adventurer might be waiting at a DMV-styled place? You can guess what type of mission this is for.

1. A 2d4+1 of adventurers are attempting to get their group's name registered at the guild.
2. A novice adventurer is attempting to register at their local Adventurer's Guild.
3. A member of the adventurer's group died during a quest, and they're attempting to get a death certificate verified.
4. An Equipment Officer is attempting to requisition additional supplies after bandits waylaid their group.
5. A student of the local academy is attempting to get their last quest accredited.
6. A group is applying for a high-tier quest.
7. An annoyed looking citizen is attempting to get reimbursed after a large amount of property was destroyed via collateral damage.
8. An officer (police or army) is attempting to get additional reinforcements for an upcoming mission.
9. A peasant is attempting to get a quest on the quest board.
10. A necromancer has sent a zombie to go complete a bureaucratic task.
11. A clearly villainous individual is about to lose their temper and unleash hell amongst those around them.
12. An obviously dangerous assassin has been charged with killing one of the officer clerks. If they reach the clerk roll, a die. On an even, the clerk is assassinated, and the line is closed and the assassin escapes (the DMV stays open). On an odd, the clerk disintegrates the assassin with a high-level spell.
13. Hunting a rare, overhunted beast... wouldn't want to extinct-ify it. The Local Equivalent of the EPA would throw a fit. [MaxSizeIs](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaxSizeIs/)
14. Someone traded an attuned item, and only the local bureaucracy-mancers can help make the change. (Optional Plot Twist, the item is stolen and may or not pass inspection as such) [MaxSizeIs](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaxSizeIs/)
15. According to regulation, a certain event requires a triplicate of Form 420-69 but that form hasn't been printed for the last 20 years. The form requires a permit each time it is issued, and must be notarized, filled out in view of an officer, Real-ID restricted, signed in blood, etc. [MaxSizeIs](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaxSizeIs/)

theres much more to roah than we think,KingkillerChronicle,1i0kwy8,2025-01-13 13:33:13,3,0.54,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1i0kwy8/theres_much_more_to_roah_than_we_think/,DamageLivid2007,Theory,"i dont think there is any way the loeclos box is anything but the box of iax(jax). there is simply so much evidence, how did caudicus charictarize the lackless? unlucky. what was iax above all? unlucky. i believe that the lackless line is the line of iax, kvothe guesses that the thing inside is glass or stone, what is glass above anything else? sharp. the names of living things are charictarized as sharp. what was felurians true name? eight lines of sharp song, what did kvothe think of when the thing passed over him in midnight? sharp, this glass and sharp part may be a stretch but i have found a bit more allusions to it than i think is coincedental... and also,  back to the main point, what else is a box that is valuable, prescious, etc. kvothes box. and another bit of theory. what smell did kvothe describe the ctheahs tree (or just the ctheah) smelling like? like lemon, spice, quenching leather. what did kvothes box and mounting board smell like?  quenching leather, im on a bit of a time crunch and cant cite the book so anybody in the comments that can help me out would be appreciated. but anyway, i have 2 working theories. 1. at the end of the 3rd book kvothe cuts the ctheah tree down and vanquishes the serpent(reference to the serpent of delphi?) but i dont think this could be. because bast never mentions it when he is in denial. option 2 but after kvothe is done with the story. he reignites his flame and recaptures his magic.  he then vanquishes the ctheah. why do i think this? well... on the cover of name of the wind. kvothe(presumably) is in a cloak with a sword. however. kvothe is naked during his 'cavorting' so. it alludes to the fact that he returns to settle a score. but because theres pretty much no chance the box and mounting board are the ctheah tree it coud be a plot hole but rothfuss was compared to tolkien in thouroughness(in my opinion that doesnt mean shit because tolkiens books are full of plot holes\[partly because robert had to kind of guess but still\]) but either way i think we can discard that idea. so roah. the ctheah tree is roah( this is pretty much confirmed) so in short. roah is likely offshoots of the ctheah. so what does this have to do with the loeclos box? 1. kvothe is the heir to the throne of the lackless family even if he is a bastard. 2. if kvothe is king of the lackless line (the oldest line) then it stands to reason by right he owns the world as well as the fae. given that iax created the fae and by proxy the creation war. so maybe the modegan royal line or meluen has some other ideas about succesion, given that kvothe is her bastard nephew. so kvothe steals the box but is cursed. or something. or he has amnesia. for whatever reason he cant open the box. however. there is something were missing. why doesnt the ctheah leave the tree? im sure it could cause much more havoc if it were mobile, what if the cteahs tree isnt just its pedestal. but its prison. but how could a simple tree hold an age old oracle of death? the simple answer? roah has iron in it. but iron alone wouldnt stop something like the ctheah, so what if roah is not natural. what if roah is somehow able to trap magical beings or simply magic itself. them for one it explains why part of the moon cant leave its box, so if kvothe has something made of roah, a chest maybe, then it should theoretically should be able to trap magical abilities.and what do we know about kote? no magic. so somehow, willingly or unwillingly kvothes magic was sealed away. in roah. so what do we know. well? maybe its not the lackless line that was cursed, but the box. and all who handled or owned it. ""wElL IaX wAs UnLuCkY BeFoRe He HaD ThE Box"" bear in mind that this story was a fairy tale that nobody believes anymore. so it could have easily changed in the passing down, so back to the point, kvothe is drained, magicless, and weary in the waystone. what changed? well i could be wrong and he could just have nothing to live for. but i dont think so. maybe him theoretically stealing the box cursed him. all this to say. i think this counters the people theorizing that roah is the bones of teh ruach/alue. i think roah is something of the ruach or of aleph. but their bones? the ruach are likely the alue and as far as i know the world hasnt ended yet so i dont think they have fallen nameless from the sky. maybe its their ribs? ribs for some reason are symbols or growth and life in many religions, so maybe they are still alive just ribless? i dont quite know, all this to say it could simply be a house plant aleph bumped off a table on accident, or it could be bones. so i dont know really how to conclude this all nice with a bow but thats just my 2 cents. 



TL;DR the loeclos box is the box iax used to capture part of the moon. and the lackless line is iaxs line because iax unlucky and lackless unlucky. further speculation about how roah is some kind of prison for the magical, hence the ctheahs tree being a pedistal and a prison, due to it smelling the same as roah. maybe kvothes magic was locked away in his box willingly or unwillingly. i also dont think  it could be the bones of the ruach/alue because the world hasnt ended yet and we still know their names. minor speculation about the cover of name of the wind due to him being clothed in the fae."

Thinking of farming aleph shards a bit here to be able to boost him to gold, than switch to Re'Vas unsure though.

Just hit gold on maugan ra, and am farming the FoC rare nodes right now  to just get to Thaddeus, than probably switching over to Oct (lvl 60 right now) to get to elite for buchard farming.

Just wanting opinions, overall I just want to be able to do events while I continue pushing my roster, I was able to get the final chest on the Xmas event just now and it was a ton of resources so want to keep up the momentum."
Finding a Jewish Mentor?,Judaism,1hy6nox,2025-01-10 10:17:27,14,0.94,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1hy6nox/finding_a_jewish_mentor/,BeeBoBop_,,"Hi folks!

  
I've accepted a job as a public defender in a rural town in Texas. I find myself with lots of questions that another observant Jewish attorney would likely know the answers to. Any ideas about how I could find an observant Jewish attorney to mentor me a little bit?

  
When I had questions about prison visitation (e.g., could I wear tzitzit when conducting a legal visit?), I turned to the helpful folks at the Aleph Institute. That said, they probably won't know the answers to some of my questions about the courtroom and legal practice (e.g., what kind of kippah should I wear in court?).

  
I know there's the American Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists (AAJLJ), but I'm not sure if they do mentorships, plus the membership fee is $125. Any thoughts would be appreciated! Shabbat shalom. 😊"

2\^(aleph-null) is beth-one, the cardinality of the real numbers. Cool.

\-qliphoth counter: an arbitrary value that can increase or decrease when certain conditions are met. when it hits 0, the abnormality does something, most often breaching.  
\-the difficulty scale: there are 5 difficulty levels of abnormality, going from easiest to hardest they are ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW, and ALEPH.  
\-stats: employees have 4 stats, fortitude (affects max hp), prudence (affects max sp (sanity)), temperance (affects work success chances and work time), and justice (affects movement and attack speed). some abnormalities do respond to how high or low an employees stat is.  
\-work types: there are 4 types of work an employee can preform, and each corresponds to a different stat, and will increase said stat as that work type is preformed multiple times: instinct work (involves maintaining the physical health of the abnormality, corresponds to fortitude), insight (involves changing the conditions of the containment unit to the abnormalities preferences, corresponds to prudence), attachment (social work, basically pretending to be the abnormality's friend, corresponds to temperance), and repression (controlling the emotional state of the abnormality by giving them therapy basically, corresponds to justice. most abnormalities hate repression work).  
\-the work process: when you send an employee to work with an abnormality, every couple of seconds they will either generate a PE box or an NE box. every time an NE box is generated, the employee will suffer damage depending on the type and amount of work damage that abnormality inflicts. after the work is completed, you will receive a work result depending on how many PE boxes were produced. every abnormality has its own unique range for what is considered a good, neutral, and bad work result.  
\-damage types: there are 4 damage types in Lcorp. red damage is physical damage, and only affects the physical body of the recipient, depleting hp only. white damage is mental damage, and only affects the mind of the recipient, depleting sp only. black damage is described as decay damage, and effects both the mind and body, depleting BOTH hp and sp at the same time. pale damage is described as damage directly to the soul of the recipient, and depletes hp by percentage (1 pale damage = 1% of the targets max hp). almost everything is weak to pale damage, and there are only like 7 sources of pale damage in the entire game.  
\-defenses: everything has a defense that will multiply the amount of damage they take when they suffer that specific type of damage. the types of defenses and their ranges are as follows: absorbant (any negative number) (this will turn the damage into healing), immune (0.0), resistant (0.1 - 0.4), endured (0.5 - 0.9), normal (1.0), weak (1.1 - 1.9), and vulnerable (2.0). the exact defense of something will always be listed after what type of defense it has, so for example something that endures (0.8) red damage will take 0.8x red damage, and something that is vulnerable (2.0) to black damage will take double black damage.  
\-E.G.O.: weapons and armor you can get from an abnormality, purchased with PE boxes that you made with it. there are 3 types of E.G.O. in Lcorp: weapons, suits, and gifts. weapons and suits are self-explanatory, but gifts are basically small passive buffs that an employee has a small chance to get after working with an abnormality. ill give most of your avatars E.G.O. but i cant promise ill be able to give it to everyone. your E.G.O. probably wont be named unless your lore is good.  
\-classification codes: an abnormalities classification code is made of 3 parts, a letter representing its orgins, a number representing its appearance, and a third number that will be unique to every single abnormality. for the sake of simplicity, all avatars i do will have their codes start with O (meaning original, or other), and will not be given a third number. as for the second number, 01 means humanoid (most of you will get this), 02 means animal, 03 means otherwordly or religious, 04 is inanimate objects, 05 is machines or robots, 06 is abstract (doesnt exist in reality (ex 1.76 MHz) or doesnt fall into any other catagories), 07 and 09 (there is no 08) are both tool abnormalities, which i will not be doing because this is already complex as is.

The following are guidelines for how it should evolve sustainably in the future to add to your portfolio according to where you want to find yourself within it as time goes on or where you want your decendants to find themselves...
(Made by a prompt with chatgpt)

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem—the networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future—a mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces—developers, ideas, innovations—that break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the “canopy” near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree’s full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk’s purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree’s eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree’s leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest’s conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree’s bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed—only the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you’ve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem’s Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem—assets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn’t compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds—set clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they’re too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they’ve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other’s innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree—tending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments—projects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix—with good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects—perhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn’t a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project’s stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin’s status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""—they are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It’s still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let’s explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree’s branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree’s weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree’s health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here’s how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI’s computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree’s Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

governments involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree’s resilience—its ability to regenerate and evolve."
ROUND 1 turning your avatars into lobotomy corporation abnormalities (example in comments),RobloxAvatars,1hs2htk,2025-01-02 14:46:16,13,1.0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobloxAvatars/comments/1hs2htk/round_1_turning_your_avatars_into_lobotomy/,MrMcMemeManIII,Avatar games/Trends,"IMPORTANT WORDS, TERMINOLOGY, AND OTHER THINGS TO KNOW (you dont have to read this but i recommend you do if you dont want my reply to just be a bunch of buzzwords)  
\-basic employee information: in lobotomy corporation you interact with the abnormalities through your employees. if their hp reaches 0 they will die, and if their sp reaches 0 they will panic.  
\-qliphoth counter: an arbitrary value that can increase or decrease when certain conditions are met. when it hits 0, the abnormality does something, most often breaching.  
\-the difficulty scale: there are 5 difficulty levels of abnormality, going from easiest to hardest they are ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW, and ALEPH.  
\-stats: employees have 4 stats, fortitude (affects max hp), prudence (affects max sp (sanity)), temperance (affects work success chances and work time), and justice (affects movement and attack speed). some abnormalities do respond to how high or low an employees stat is.  
\-work types: there are 4 types of work an employee can preform, and each corresponds to a different stat, and will increase said stat as that work type is preformed multiple times: instinct work (involves maintaining the physical health of the abnormality, corresponds to fortitude), insight (involves changing the conditions of the containment unit to the abnormalities preferences, corresponds to prudence), attachment (social work, basically pretending to be the abnormality's friend, corresponds to temperance), and repression (controlling the emotional state of the abnormality by giving them therapy basically, corresponds to justice. most abnormalities hate repression work).  
\-the work process: when you send an employee to work with an abnormality, every couple of seconds they will either generate a PE box or an NE box. every time an NE box is generated, the employee will suffer damage depending on the type and amount of work damage that abnormality inflicts. after the work is completed, you will receive a work result depending on how many PE boxes were produced. every abnormality has its own unique range for what is considered a good, neutral, and bad work result.  
\-damage types: there are 4 damage types in Lcorp. red damage is physical damage, and only affects the physical body of the recipient, depleting hp only. white damage is mental damage, and only affects the mind of the recipient, depleting sp only. black damage is described as decay damage, and effects both the mind and body, depleting BOTH hp and sp at the same time. pale damage is described as damage directly to the soul of the recipient, and depletes hp by percentage (1 pale damage = 1% of the targets max hp). almost everything is weak to pale damage, and there are only like 7 sources of pale damage in the entire game.  
\-E.G.O.: weapons and armor you can get from an abnormality, purchased with PE boxes that you made with it. there are 3 types of E.G.O. in Lcorp: weapons, suits, and gifts. weapons and suits are self-explanatory, but gifts are basically small passive buffs that an employee has a small chance to get after working with an abnormality. ill give most of your avatars E.G.O. but i cant promise ill be able to give it to everyone. your E.G.O. probably wont be named unless your lore is good.  
\-classification codes: an abnormalities classification code is made of 3 parts, a letter representing its orgins, a number representing its appearance, and a third number that will be unique to every single abnormality. for the sake of simplicity, all avatars i do will have their codes start with O (meaning original, or other), and will not be given a third number. as for the second number, 01 means humanoid (most of you will get this), 02 means animal, 03 means otherwordly or religious, 04 is inanimate objects, 05 is machines or robots, 06 is abstract (doesnt exist in reality (ex 1.76 MHz) or doesnt fall into any other catagories), 07 and 09 (there is no 08) are both tool abnormalities, which i will not be doing because this is already complex as is.

RULES  
\-no project moon related avatars, it takes away quite a bit from doing this for me. none of the other abnormalities have stuff from other abnormalities and neither should you.  
\-keep cosplay avatars to a minimum, im not doing if x character was an abnormality, im doing if your avatar was an abnormality.  
\-lore helps a TON. if you have it, put it so i can give you a more detailed abnormality and even a unique name maybe."
New reader questions interested in Pale,Parahumans,1hqv6ts,2024-12-31 23:00:47,20,0.92,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/1hqv6ts/new_reader_questions_interested_in_pale/,Losahn,,"Hey new reader here. I lurked around this sub a couple years back when I was finishing up Worm and have recently heard about some of Wildbow's other works. I'm going to start Pale pretty soon and would love to know a few things before jumping in:

1. I'm a *very* plot focused reader. Not a big fan of ambiguous endings, unresolved mysteries, or ant-climaxes. (Ex: wasn't a fan of Worm's original ending). I was wondering if Pale wraps up a lot of the introduced mysteries and plot threads?
2. Kind of tying with the above point, are there cool overarching worldbuilding mysteries? Not whodunnit type stories but rather stuff like Endbringer Origins, >!the Shards!<, >!Earth Aleph!< etc.
3. Is there action using Pale's Magic? The massive Kaiju like fights in Arcs >!8 & 24!< of Worm was some of the best fiction I've ever read. Even if it's not on that scale I was wondering whether Pale really utilizes the magic for epic fights?

Side note: *I love* training/studying arcs in stories. Characters learning how magic works, experimenting and getting stronger. Worm didn't have much of this but I'm hoping it's in Pale."

"Galgals - Tips, Trivia, and FUN!",cavesofqud,1hnlv1r,2024-12-27 13:49:39,25,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cavesofqud/comments/1hnlv1r/galgals_tips_trivia_and_fun/,SirDorfleBurg,,"**The Beginning**

Yesterday, I decided to test what playing a galgal is like, as testing it against a >!nephilim resulted in a chord of light on the floor!<. First things first, I summoned a galgal and gave myself a ganglionic teleprojector (all through wishes just to test it out), and I was surprised. It could move across the map in an instant, however it could only do that if it could see the place it was going to. If you somehow got clairvoyance (through a relic or something else), you could barrel through shale and other non-tough walls like anything. Alternatively, you could barrel into the wall, going slightly past it, which has the same effect. However, I'm pretty sure this all changes with tough walls like fullcrete, **you just go through them.** Yeah, you don't break them. You go through them.  Back to this later, more in depth.

  
Now, if you thought this was OP, it gets better.

  
**Slots**

  
A Galgal has **15** slots in total, consisting of 6 eye slots, 3 wheel slots, 3 hardpoints, a body and a floating nearby slot. 

The eye slots count as face slots, so if you really want to, you can wear 6 >!sultan masks!<. The right hardpoint and left hardpoint count as missile slots, allowing you to carry one big gun or two small guns, more on this later. The middle hardpoint, however, is a hand slot, but you have just one, so multiweapon fighting is worthless, at least without something that I'll get to later. The wheel slots are weird, and from my understanding, they can only house tread guards. The body is just a regular body, and whilst the floating nearby slot is just a regular floating nearby slot, it is undoubtedly the best slot. Back to the hardpoints with a piece of advice: don't put guns in your hardpoints unless you know they are better than a [Naser cannon](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Data:Naser_cannon_(galgal)) (sorry for the link). The Naser cannon is built into the galgal and requires charge to function. It reduces your move speed, which is irrelevant because of the ability run over. (we'll get to this later).  The Naser cannon has high accuracy, 15 PV, 1d12 damage and it knocks any flying enemies it hits out of the sky, disallowing them to fly for multiple turns allowing you to *run them over.* It's also just a good weapon in general, and normalizes anything it hits.

  
Subtopic: Getting more hands/arms

  
This is kinda spoilery, so if only proceed if you have at least the achievement Aleph, or have seen a Nephilim and want to continue anyway.  
>!The craving for more arms is very common among galgals. However, there is only one true galgal capable of getting more arms. That galgal is you! It's actually quite simple, gaining more arms. At first you might try helping hands, but there is no back slot. What to do? Well, killing Girsh Nephilim is quite easy as a Galgal, and definitely doable, and there just so happens to be a nephilim that gives you two extra arms. If you are willing to spend the time to get ready for the nephilim, that's great, because this isn't a nephilim killing guide. What I will tell you is that I did one hit Girsh Agolgot with a waydroid and a nuke, so you could try something like that. But anyway, killing him will result in two extra arms, and there you go, you have successfully become the first armed galgal of your world; three hand slots, two arm slots, and a worn on pincers slot. I will be referring to these galgals as galgalgals.!<

  
**Rolling, Damage Sources, and armor stats.**

Essentially, a galgalgal (for those who didn't want spoilers, what I call a 3-handed galgal), is mostly the same as a 3-armed true kin or mutant **without** and cybernetics or mutations, kinda. The galgalgal has dark-vision, which is a worse version of night vision goggles, permitting night vision but less sight area. We'll get to this later (again). With three arms, you are pretty much equal to anyone like you in terms of weapon holding, which is an upside. On a blank galgal with nothing equipped, you will have a base 15 AV, 8 DV, 15 MA, 175 QS, 100 MS and 400 health. Now, rolling; a galgal's main weapon. It allows you to cross the entire map in one turn, assuming it is day or you have night vision goggles. Generally, when you fight a galgal, what happens is something like this: The galgal sees you, immediately charges and it will likely knock you down and daze you. Due to the quickness, it will most likely charge again, knocking you down once more, which deals significant damage. It is your turn, and you spend it standing up. Now the galgal repeats the action of charging you down one or two times. This generally repeats until, somehow, you escape, or you die. Now, think about this: *you are the galgal.* When testing on a snapjaw, it dealt 47 damage.  It appears to deal anywhere from 40-60 damage, but also seems to have low penetration, but there is no info on the ability that I know of. Through some thorough testing, I got a few numbers to help you out:

  
\- On a protector of the stilt with carbide plate armor, a folded carbide sword, a carbide shield, and steel boots it took me 5 rolls to kill him. He dealt 0 damage.

\- On Mamon Souldrinker, it took me 5 rolls to kill him. He dealt 0 damage.

\- On Saad Amus, it took me 10 hits to kill him. He dealt 0 damage.

  
The galgal's roll abilities are quite strong, even if it has low penetration, which I'm not sure of. However, when fighting Mamon, I encountered something interesting. First off, remember how I said you could just go **through** tough walls? **Force walls are tough walls. Force walls are see-through.** You can glide through force walls, allowing you to daze chrome pyramids. However, chrome pyramids are still capable of killing you due to the unpredictable pattern of the missiles, so I suggest going in an hourglass shape if fighting them. Or maybe I'm just bad. I dunno. But, point is, you can go through force walls, which is insane.

  
**Becoming a Galgal in classic mode**

All of the previous stuff I've found has been using wishes to gain data, but I actually did become a galgal. Keep in mind, becoming a galgal is very fluid, but this is how I did it.

The calling should be give extra ego; eg water merchant or apostle.  
First off I suggest getting a mutant with these following mutations:

\- Domination

\- Precog

\- Wings (optional)

  
Now, pump your ego and willpower up and get a little bit of another attribute so you can live out there. First order of business, get the trinket from the guy who wants you to go to the stilt, collect his trinket, give it to Argyve along with another one of your useless trinkets. Now, get look at your town statues, go to red rock (but don't complete) and your historical site (don't complete). Then, go to the stilt accepting any ruin prompt along the way. Collect as many books as you can, and get to around lvl 10-11 with high ego (\~28). Spend points in wayfaring and rush to kyakukya, do the precog-dominate loop until you become crowsong. Don't dominate yourself, because you have no stats and kinda suck (unless you don't know for sure your method of killing the original you will 1-hit kill, which could be likely). Instead, dominate Indrix or some other tough guy and somehow strand your mind by getting lucky with a decapitate or throwing a grenade at him. Be sure to precog if you do this, possibly metamorphosing into yourself. Be careful, as when you are crowsong your turns dwindle and you can only switch bodies about 3 times at this level. Now, after killing the OG you, return to crowsong form (who has mind's compass) and head to yd freehold. There is many eyes, a galgal and founder of yd freehold. Many Eyes is exactly the same as a galgal, but when metamorphed into them the stats might be slightly different due to being crowsong. Another approach to permanent becoming of a galgal is to ganglionic teleproject, which will likely not change the stats, however it does not really matter.

  
A galgal's base stats are 38 ST, 20 AG, 38 TO, 38 WI, 19 IN, 17 EG, 400 HP, 15 AV, 8 DV, 175 QS, 100 MS, 15 MA, 0 Acid Res, 60 Cold Res, 60 Heat Res, -50 Elec Res. They are level 40.



**Pros, Cons, and Trivia**

\- Although the stats may be decreased through the crowsong method, you cannot eat as a galgal, thus blocking you from the main story. Being Crowsong also allows you to change if you are in a pinch, and you can also turn your galgal run into sludge run.

\- Wearing 6 >!sultan masks!< would be funny, but reserving two for night-sight interpolators and night vision goggles would help with combat and traversing at night.

\- Being level 40 means that it is harder to gain skill points, so I suggest reserving your water rituals until you have become a galgal so people can teach you tinkering. However, being level 40 does not mean that you cannot get skill points, and you can possibly do some funky business to be able to drink warm static, but I got nothing.

\- Being a robot means you do not hunger or thirst, so your liquid that you'd usually keep tons of is completely irrelevant now.

Thank you for reading. I will now return to figuring out what to do with all this information I just wrote over the past two hours. Just message me if you want to know about galgals, I suppose I kinda am an expert now. Thank you!

Am I misunderstanding what makes Aleph-null strong?,WH40KTacticus,1hn2whj,2024-12-26 19:55:03,40,0.87,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/WH40KTacticus/comments/1hn2whj/am_i_misunderstanding_what_makes_alephnull_strong/,frodakai,Discussion,"To preface, I'm a pretty early-game player. Cleared most of the base campaigns but no notable progress on elites as of yet. Recently finished Indomitus mirror, which brings me to this post. 

I've been levelling Aleph-null as much as I can. Currently on the cusp of silver 2, with rank 32 active. Early in the campaign, the scarabs just took over maps and I didnt have to do anything, leading me to believe that this is what makes Aleph so OP. However, when doing chapter 5, scarabs just die instantly to any inceptor enemies, even at rank 32, before having the chance to replicate. They did, effectively, nothing short of killing their initial target, and I relied on Anuphet summons (also rank 32) to clear missions for me. 

I know Indom Mirror Elite is brutal, and will require S2-3s and a G1-3 Aleph to clear, but if inceptors in the regular campaign are already deleting my scarabs (who will not get stronger as I juice up Alpehs personal ranking), I can't imagine they'll survive the elite campaign at all, even at higher ranks. 

So a TL;DR - Is Aleph-null so strong because scarabs carry missions for you, or is it's real strength just in being a healing stat-monster, who's scarabs don't do much in the elite campaign?"

The shadow of yggdrasil as the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape,ChatGPT,1hmt5eu,2024-12-26 12:25:35,0,0.27,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hmt5eu/the_shadow_of_yggdrasil_as_the_evolution_of_the/,BenjiiXDraco117,Prompt engineering ,"Based on a vision i had after microdosing, i've come to beleive that cryptocurrencies are a naturally arising counter to the world tree of Norse mythology, Yggdrasil. The following are guidelines for how it should evolve sustainably in the future to add to your portfolio according to where you want to find yourself within it as time goes on or where you want your decendants to find themselves...
(Made by a prompt with chatgpt)

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem—the networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future—a mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces—developers, ideas, innovations—that break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the “canopy” near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree’s full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk’s purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree’s eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.





---

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree’s leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest’s conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree’s bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed—only the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you’ve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.

3. Understand the Ecosystem’s Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem—assets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn’t compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds—set clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they’re too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they’ve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other’s innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree—tending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments—projects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix—with good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects—perhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn’t a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project’s stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin’s status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""—they are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It’s still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let’s explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree’s branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree’s weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree’s health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here’s how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI’s computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree’s Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

Your observation about governments attempting to wrest control is a significant one. Their involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree’s resilience—its ability to regenerate and evolve."
The shadow of yggdrasil as the evolving cryptocurrency landscape,chaosmagick,1hmt4q1,2024-12-26 12:24:41,0,0.25,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/chaosmagick/comments/1hmt4q1/the_shadow_of_yggdrasil_as_the_evolving/,BenjiiXDraco117,,"Based on a vision i had after microdosing, i've come to beleive that cryptocurrencies are a naturally arising counter to the world tree of Norse mythology, Yggdrasil. The following are guidelines for how it should evolve into the deep future. Strategies and warnings based on my own strategy.


The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem—the networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future—a mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces—developers, ideas, innovations—that break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the “canopy” near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree’s full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk’s purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree’s eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.





---

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree’s leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest’s conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree’s bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed—only the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you’ve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem’s Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem—assets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn’t compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds—set clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they’re too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they’ve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other’s innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree—tending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments—projects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix—with good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects—perhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn’t a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project’s stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin’s status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""—they are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It’s still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let’s explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree’s branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree’s weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree’s health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here’s how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI’s computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree’s Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

Your observation about governments attempting to wrest control is a significant one. Their involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree’s resilience—its ability to regenerate and evolve."
The shadow of yggdrasil,CryptoCurrency,1hmrynl,2024-12-26 11:32:04,0,0.3,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hmrynl/the_shadow_of_yggdrasil/,BenjiiXDraco117,ANALYSIS,"Based on a vision i had after microdosing, i've come to beleive that cryptocurrencies are a naturally arising counter to the world tree of Norse mythology, Yggdrasil. The following are guidelines for how it should evolve sustainably in the future to add to your portfolio according to where you want to find yourself within it as time goes on or where you want your decendants to find themselves...
(Made by a prompt with chatgpt)

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem—the networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future—a mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces—developers, ideas, innovations—that break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the “canopy” near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree’s full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk’s purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree’s eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.





---

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree’s leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest’s conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree’s bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed—only the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you’ve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem’s Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem—assets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn’t compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds—set clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they’re too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they’ve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other’s innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree—tending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments—projects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix—with good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects—perhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn’t a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project’s stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin’s status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""—they are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It’s still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let’s explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree’s branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree’s weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree’s health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here’s how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI’s computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree’s Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

Your observation about governments attempting to wrest control is a significant one. Their involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree’s resilience—its ability to regenerate and evolve."

Most effective Autodidact Hebrew Resources?,biblicalhebrew,1hj9a1f,2024-12-21 07:54:20,4,0.84,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/biblicalhebrew/comments/1hj9a1f/most_effective_autodidact_hebrew_resources/,lickety-split1800,,"Greetings, all!

A year ago, I started learning Ancient Greek on my own to read the Greek New Testament (GNT) and the Septuagint (LXX). I am now reading the GNT, with 2,700 out of 5,000 vocabulary words memorised.

I really enjoy reading the Bible in its original language, and I hope one day to do the same for the Masoretic Text.

I've been searching for textbooks with instructional or lecture videos, and I've found two:

1. **Basics of Biblical Hebrew** – Zondervan: [https://zondervanacademic.com/products/basics-of-biblical-hebrew-video-lectures1](https://zondervanacademic.com/products/basics-of-biblical-hebrew-video-lectures1)
2. **Learn Biblical Hebrew Grammar** – Bill Barrick: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvh8yziVsCE&list=PL9392DD285C853693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvh8yziVsCE&list=PL9392DD285C853693)

I learned Greek using Black's *Learn to Read New Testament Greek*, which is the easiest book for autodidacts. I'd like to find something equally accessible for Hebrew with instructional videos. Do you have any recommendations?

I'm aware of *Aleph with Beth*, but I'd prefer to start with the grammar-translation method, as it took me only four months with Black's book to learn Greek grammar.

I've seen many positive reviews for *Learning Biblical Hebrew* by Karl Kutz and Rebekah Josberger, but the only issue is that I can't find any lectures for it.

Thanks!"
Onslaught Mid-Game Shuffle ,WH40KTacticus,1hir1o5,2024-12-20 14:03:06,10,0.92,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WH40KTacticus/comments/1hir1o5/onslaught_midgame_shuffle/,F0urTheWin,Discussion,"Hello all! I've been playing WH40k Tacticus since August. In that time I've taken to learning the in-game economic barriers to progression that people seem to complain about most on these forums. From what I can tell, Books/Experience are far FAR more necessary than I can fully comprehend as a “Mid-Game” player. 


I define myself as at THE Mid point of progression because I've:
- Unlocked all campaigns + mirrors 
- Unlocked 3 zones (~50%) of each elite campaign
- Possess 10 G1 characters with aims to hit Diamond 1 on Aleph0 in January (followed by Bellator etc) 
- Achieved 250 shards in Kharn LRE without much effort (1st shot) 
- Hold 20+ epic orbs each faction for flexibility 
- Hold 30+ epic badges each faction for flexibility
- Hold 100+ Codex books for flexibility


It's been an incredible ride so far & I've found this to be the best most engrossing, competitive & dynamic mobile game I've ever played. Possibly of any platform really. 


Which brings me to my predicament: the sheer amount of books / codex required to Ascend to the next “tiers” of endgame progression is just bonkers… 


I fully appreciate the standard gating procedures of ascension like Orbs & Badges. I get it; I've controlled my resources & pulled my itchy finger off the various BIG NUMBER buttons. Now I find myself at a very comfortable plateau where I may power-Ascend in any direction. 


Like, my Eldyron is level 40 + Doom @ 40. I can absolutely take him higher, but I'd rather not drain my coins, Xenos badges or Books. Similar with Aethana @ level 35. Taking Aleph + Bellator to Diamond will suck up plenty of resources which I'd rather keep on hand for. 


I've been toying around with a counter-intuitive solution to this, which I am presenting for constructive criticism on these forums: 


In the near future, I plan to use the majority (>50%) of my Onslaughts for Xenos & Chaos to Honor Snotflogga & Maladus*** I call it the Mid-Game Shuffle because it marks a specific inflection point which shuffles the Onslaught priorities from early game (roster rarity increase) to late game (amass max level units). 



I've determined that this course of action will solve three (3) ascension gates simultaneously, albeit somewhat slowly:
- Generate Legendary Badges 
- Generate Legendary Orbs
- Enabling daily+bi-weekly archeotech faucets

Unlocking Rogue Trader means very little if you have no shards to spend… Which as a mid-game player is expected. By targeting both tracks before I'm pushing Diamonds exclusively (i.e. LATEgame), it should further increase my book / codex income after a period of investment & allow me to maintain my platform of flexibility into 2025. The tradeoff being non-Imperial character rarity will stagnate, which I'm cool with. 

While I will acknowledge this could pay further dividends IF characters I want to unlock end up in Rogue Trader, it is my intent to fully convert archeotech to books at every opportunity possible. 


My current estimate is that by June I should be swimming in Legendary Orbs, Badges & be somewhat less limited by books than a typical newly minted late-game player. 

So, long time players, what do you think? Am I setting myself up for success or just overthinking the whole situation? Appreciate you reading this far! Best of luck in current TA, upcoming HRE & Survival events! 




*** caveats: 
1) neither Snotflogga or Maladus will be Honored until they are ALREADY legendary (Snot is, Mal will be next week) 

2) I'm comfortable with my current character shard / rarity balance through my roster (spoiler: super SUPER close to that already!) 

3) I will of course swap to honoring characters that I have “on deck” to upgrade to diamond which aren't already legendary 

4) Imperials aren't included because none of the recurring activities (daily quests, tokens, raids) give any of their shards.

[Total Beginner Question] Um...What the hell just happened in the first part of Hickman's Avengers 1?,OmnibusCollectors,1higzu2,2024-12-20 05:29:17,3,0.67,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OmnibusCollectors/comments/1higzu2/total_beginner_question_umwhat_the_hell_just/,_how_can_she_slap,Questions/Help Needed,"So, I'm kinda embarrassed, but I have wanted to get into Jonathan Hickman's Fantastic Four & Avengers runs, but they are, uh, making me see how much I still have to learn about reading comics! I finished the first Fantastic Four Omnibus, and loved it. But since the second Omni appears to be the price of a goddamn kidney, I moved over to the Avengers. 

  
In the very first part, when Cap, Tony, Natasha, Thor, and Barton (I think that's it) head to Mars, Ex Nihilo's uneven horns tell us that he and and his sister, Abyss, were hatched (I guess?) from their Aleph. Who, itself, was created by ""the mother herself, the Universe."" That's all fine and good, and I think I get it up to this point. But what I'm trying to understand is what happened when Cap returned with the JV team (plus Logan and Spidey) (I'm just kidding. Holy shit, who is Hyperion?! At first I thought his name was Clark!). 

  
It seems like Captain Universe (who I just looked up) maybe turned into (?) the ""mother Universe?"" And then, by doing so, he/she was able to subdue, ultimately, the Aleph. Does this sound right? If so, is the woman we see ""the Universe?"" Or does the Universe appear as someone, and in this instance, that someone looks like Captain Universe? I'm sorry, I guess I wasn't sure if Captain Universe is a different person than the Universe, and maybe they became one temporarily? Or if he is always the Universe. 

  
Heh, that's kind of a funny question: ""hey ya'll, this dude always the universe, or what?"" Man I love this stuff so much. 

  
Thank you for any insight! "
Golden Sun - Battle Mages on Pursuit,JRPG,1hhca17,2024-12-18 16:27:50,0,0.31,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hhca17/golden_sun_battle_mages_on_pursuit/,LogicalFlakes,Review,"Golden. Sun. This game and I have a history and beef. And it all began in 2001. \*\*\* (to skip my personal history with this game; go to \*\*\* paragraph)

On the year of its release I managed to snag this game at a discount of $20! Which isn't a lot, but for a tween with no allowances, well, what a better game to spend that money on because this game has something to say. The game begins by setting the setting for the reason the journey begins it all. And the neat thing about it is that the initial set-up also introduces and creates motivations, anxieties, and character archetypes for the notable characters. The second incident being the reason why this journey begins through sheer curiosity and two mysterious people who knocked two kids unconscious and also saved one.

If only there was a skip function! I'm tired of that intro. I hate it. On first playthrough it was rather captivating, but on following playthroughs lets just say I'm glad emulation exists. And even with emulation (at 5x) and skipping dialogue, it still took me 40 minutes to leave Vale! You see- the reason I've seen this intro many times is because on a hot summer day, I went to a pool party. I was the kid who always carried around his GBA and 1 or 2 games in his many pocketed cargo shorts. I was also a spontaneous kiddo and dove into the pool, cannon-ball style, and only realized that my pockets felt heavy. My games! Well I dove back in and got them. Harmony of Dissonance survived, Fire Emblem was inside my GBA so it survived, but Golden Sun... my save file was corrupted (and likely the battery inside). And it turns out, through the Nintendo forums (shoutout to anyone who remembers that naïve place lol), I was at the final dungeon... AT the final battle.

This has happened to me before by accidentally overwriting a save for example on the PS1 or SNES. But because my battery got mangled, I couldn't save. And I tried, with an ac adapter and leaving it on, to beat it, but no dice. And thus. I got sick of that intro.

**\*\*\*** But the game itself is still fun. I remember the Golden sun Ads on Nintendo power. What really drew me were the graphics. Certainly, graphics don't make the game for me, but these were unique, but similar. I rented Beyond the Beyond for the same very reason (but that game was not fun) prior. I also managed to snag a copy of Suikoden not knowing what it was, but loving that game as well (also having a similar fate as GS, but that's for future me to finally finish).  
Point is- I love seeing my characters do cool attacks and powerful spells. Final Fantasy III (SNES) was my first and because of it, I could never get into first-person jrpgs at the time. Golden Sun had some of the coolest looking battle scenarios. And the characters also showed having different equipment! I love this! FF III, VII, Tactics, and so on did this and I always thought this was one of the coolest things for me. Even Chrono Trigger did this by changing the color and I recognized that and I always liked that little attention to detail.  
GS is just beautiful to look at. And it's really surprising for me to say, but the game still graphically holds up. The way the characters leap to enemies to strike them. The way each of those enemies bounce when being attacked. The heroes feeling the impact of spells and attacks. The juggling of spells when an enemy or hero gets hit with a spell. It's all in this tiny little handheld; cramped and chugging. In fact, I was always a fan of slow-down animations due to the hardware being pushed, so seeing bombastic spells and summons slow down the game with some stellar sound damaging effects just felt right. Even a critical strike or a chance at an artifact weapon. It all felt so satisfying to watch and listen to. I never did get to see the heroes battle-sprite faces much, but that's because, well, the game is a lot easier than I remember.

The battle system kind of always confused me a bit when I was younger. And it all really burns down to Djinn. Real quick- if you remove Djinn from the game, you get a standard sword and sorcery group slowly learning their new spells and using their artifacts, items, and so on.  
And the cool thing about this is that these heroes are essentially mages. Otherwise known in the world as Adepts, these mages slowly regenerate their MP (pp) in the overworld which makes sense given the context of their beings and the game. Golden Sun is about mages trying to stop others from unleashing alchemy which would allow non-adepts to have pseudo access to spells (granted- I haven't played the Lost Age yet. I just finished the first game in after twenty years).  
So it's a unique concept to me. You really don't get many mage-only party groups out there acting like mages and doing mage-like things such as unleashing the magic within a weapon to slap the shit out of a monster's sensitive, vulnerable tummy. The game often reminds the player and cast that they see them as just kids. It's likely they're roughly around age 15 give or take and are all presented to be gifted with mysterious powers and not skill. They're referred to as warriors, but I don't think they've ever been admired for their battle expertise. And I think this is important because this is what a battle-mage is to me. They use their mage like powers to wield powerful artifacts and equipment that only they can use. I'm sure Garen is physically strong, but I'm sure his magic also helps him wield a great sword. This is further looked into when the cast talk about their gifts and how they unleash ""critical strikes"".  
Unfortunately, Djinn kind of turn these battle-mages into summoners or sorcerers with powerful familiars. That is if you understand how they function both in-game and in battle. Djinn are your secret stat builders and spell modifiers. This system is somewhat unique as I can only remember Craymel from Tales of Eternia doing something like this, but I digress. Djinn can help alter or bolster an adept by changing spells and stats almost like a pseudo junction system from FFVIII. And I recall rarely using Djinn and just holding auto attack and healing after very battle when I was younger because of those fat stats and bigger HP pools.  
Once you get two of the same Djinn, you get access to summons that do a lot of damage compared to just one Djinn. To sum this all up, once you get 2 Djinn of the same alignment, that's all you really need to play the rest of the game except for specific boss battles. And even then, those specific boss battles are boss battles that survived 4 Djinn summons in a row or because it's early game and you only have 5 Djinn at the first tower. The game turns into Grandia II where you spam powerful (AoE) spells to speed up random battles. And as you accrue more Djinn, the enemies really don't scale past one summon until late game where you need, \*gasp\*, two summons! And I believe the Djinn were meant to be taken advantage of because no matter what you do and no matter how much you buff, your attacks will never outclass spells and their damage (which fits to these characters being mages foremost).  
But the crazy thing is that the Djinn recover when running around in the world map or dungeon as noted by their distinct SFX of being ready to be used. The kicker out of all of this is that at least 3 will have recharged by the time you get into another random battle. So it's just a matter of hearing 3 recharge ticks, unsetting them for a summon, run into your next battle, summon, and repeat. I rarely had to use items or PP restoratives because the Djinn were cost effective in everything. Ivan is also the fastest so he was guaranteed to go first and wipe out the enemies. If someone did get hurt, then Isaac would just heal them up and restore his PP running around. Which means all my time is spent on the puzzles.

I'm going to keep this segment short because the puzzles are split into three distinct things.  
Puzzle 1: Obvious set-piece to waste your time. These aren't really puzzles as much as, 'remember you have psyenergy?' It's character-to-world building at best. Yet there's so many of these! A puddle, a sprout, branches, a block, a reveal area. I think Camelot went a bit too far with these because the most difficult these puzzles get are as such: move this block to get access to another block to let you hope across.   
Puzzle 2: Actual puzzles. These puzzles aren't that difficult to me now, but some were head scratchers when I first played the game. Most of the fun ones are found in Crossbone Isle or at the final dungeon(s), but some are also sprinkled here and there such as the forest with logs and following the critters. Most of these puzzles aren't so bad, but are annoying because of spell detection being finnicky. You can be smack dab in front of something and move or lift won't detect it.  
Puzzle 3: These are specifically Djinn puzzles. Djinn are what you want in this game as stated prior. If not for summon abuse, if not for stats, if not for completion, but for taunting you that they exist and therefore taunt you with said existence because they know you can't figure out how they got there for you to capture them. Most of these have you think outside of the box of the normal puzzles because of how town terrain works. And for dungeons, some have you either go out the way or have you roll a log specifically to get to it. Granted, half of these aren't difficult, but say for something like the Tret dungeon where unless you're a curious person looking for loot, you may miss out on a Djinn.  
With the puzzle explanation out of the way, now I can talk about the dungeon design.

The dungeons are okay. I've come across posts where people really enjoy the dungeon design for Golden Sun and I kind of see it? First and foremost the dungeons are designed for the puzzles. So it's no different than a Soul Reaver dungeon or Legend of Zelda dungeon. You're gonna be pushing blocks to press a switch and move on. And on the GBA, these rooms are a lot smaller because of it. You cannot advance until you push this block or freeze this puddle. Then you have the other puzzles which are really just figure out where to hop to get across. The alternative these rooms are the big rooms which are multiple branching paths.  
These are great because in a screen so small, they're also big enough to let you see alternate paths to make you wonder ""did I go the right way?"" And that question is always in my mind when I play a JRPG. I never asked this question more than when I first played Phantasy Star IV. Whenever I asked that I was really asking myself, ""did I just lock myself in somewhere and MISS AN IMPORTANT ITEM LIKE AN ANTIDOE OR +4atk SWORD?! Or am I going the right way for an item?""  
Last thing I want to note about these dungeons is that I can lenient on why it is so, but these dungeon puzzles just reset even after solving them. I mentioned how the design makes you wonder if you missed an item which likely has you backtracking to the alternate path. When you return to where you last were, that puzzle you just solved, it resets. My only guess is that's how the game was designed or because 32kb of ram isn't enough for a handheld to remember the dungeon being ""solved"".  This was definitely annoying for me, but a non-issue because I just spammed summons regardless rather than run away or use a feather to hinder enemy encounters. But moving blocks eats a lot of your time in this game.

However what really eats most of your time in this game is the dialogue. There's so much dialogue here. And as someone who plays JRPGs for the gameplay, all I can say is that it only chooses to be wordy when necessary. A lot of the cutscenes are really for plot progression and not so much reminders outside of picking the silly answer. I have to say- I am glad I got to play this again with emulation. Not only for speed up for all the summons I was spamming, but because the game has a lot of yes or no Isaac prompts that are used for player interaction or to remind the player of pass events (this game can be long if given the chance).  
With save states, you can simply save prior to choosing a yes or no question and load. This way I got to see all the funny dialogue choices or ""incorrect"" ones. Very amusing! I remember trying this at one point and even though the game allows you to save anywhere, it's can be deterring to go through the game menu, load, and go through all that dialogue just to get a slightly altering response (but I do recall that not stopping me for the city of Tolbi, hah).  
I'm also a player that likes to speak to every NPC and being able to read their minds (for either plot progression or just to get more flavor text), well... that added a lot more time than necessary, but I did enjoy it. Enjoyable dialogue or not, does it lend to the story?

The quick answer is no. The flavor text and NPCs do help world build just a teeny bit, but they're mostly written for comedic value mostly. Thus, outside the mind-reading and NPC text aiming for story progressing (which is minimal), all you have left is... the story!  
To be frank- there isn't much to the story. This is because the game was split up in two books. I didn't know this at first until recently, but Camelot decided to Ys I&II the game. And I'm thankful for that. I was starting to wonder why all these things were in the midst of getting from lighthouse 1 to lighthouse 2.  
The game is essentially a ""chase the bad guy"" thing and mostly set-up. As a standalone game, it's not that great, but in the grand scheme, it's perfect. The game's story and plot points only have you asking questions upon questions which will either result in a great pay-off, a disappointment, or a cliffhanger! Yeesh.  
But it really does have you asking why people act differently, what the deal is with alchemy, the deal with Ivan's staff, and the whole adept clan thing. There isn't much really outside of the eruption of Mt.Aleph is causing the world to change on top of the lighthouses being lit and it's due to Saturos and Menardi's doing. And instead of getting answers or resolutions, you get more questions on Sheba and Felix's motives on top of ""okay, but what about Alex though? What's his connection in all of this and Mia?"" Heck- the game even ends on the pivotal point of getting a ship!  
I personally never really cared for story when it comes to JRPGs. It's more about the impact and character reactions and developments around it for me. And even then, I can take it or leave it. It's probably why I liked the end of Bravely Default or SaGa games in general. But to back me, I'm going to ruffle some jammies. I don't think Chrono Trigger has a ""captivating"" story. What makes CT work is how Lavos affected all these people throughout time. The kingdom of Zeal is the story and it's pretty boring. But the whole prehistoric bit with Azala is one of my favoite time periods in the game. Azala is a favorite character of mine in Chrono Trigger because Azala is written like a baddie-of-the-day villain, but the cause, to me, feels just given the time period. Reptites or humans.... and in comes Labos and Azala's dying wish. That whole period had nothing to do with story other than a result of Magus and the time Lavos was introduced to the planet. It could've been cut and has been mentioned in FUTURE A.D. All you get out of it is a stone for the Masamune or something. But everything I explained is also what Golden Sun is doing. It's showcasing what the eruption did and is doing to not only the world, but the people with being bonked in the head with psyenergy-stones and how they are affected.

Music and Sound: A lot of this is subjective more-so than say something like story or graphics, so either you enjoy what you hear or you don't. All I can do is remind you that the battle sound effects really compliment the battle animations well. That and I'm glad there's an option to turn off the ""speech"" sfx. I liked it when I was younger, but now I don't. It's still unique because I think text ""speed"" sfx wasn't done much (probably for good reason). And I think Animal Crossing is the only game I think can get away with it for me.  
And yeah- I love the Battle theme. Always have. It's my favorite theme in the game. But the OST is great all around and fits a lot of the world and story (great example is the Tret dungeon or the Saturos and Menardi theme imposing how much of a threat they are). However I find the boss battle theme to be such a letdown overall. But it just burns down to if you're a fan of Sakuraba's work or not. Maybe you'll like his tennis music more, haha.

  
Honestly I think these games deserve a remaster similar to Ys I&II Chronicles. And the remaster should mostly focus on visuals because no matter how you upscale them, the game sprites are held back by the GBA's defining sprite art-style.  The story would also benefit from it as the first half, book 1, is really just a set-up or disc 1 of the meat of the game (I assume not having played part 2 yet). And a skip function would also be amazing. I think Golden Sun is a great introductory game to the genre at the time of its release. In fact, I would say it's worth playing even now, especially if you're okay with the flow of the game since it isn't inherently grindy or difficult. But if you have played many JRPGs and are a story/character person, then I'd say it's worth passing."

The Hebrew word for father is av. It's made up of two Hebrew letters: the aleph and the bet, or our ""a"" and ""b."" The aleph, in ancient Hebrew, represents an ox; the bet represents a house. So a father is the ox of the house. He's the strength and the ultimate burden bearer. An ox's strength is a great blessing. But the ox is known for its stubbornness as well. So if you're a father, you're to be the strength of your family. That strength is given by God. But be careful that your strength doesn't turn into blind stubbornness. Be stubborn for good and for love, but never in anger, bitterness, pride or domination. For the stubbornness of a father for anger and pride has destroyed countless families and lives. But the stubbornness of a father for love, compassion, godliness, and mercy has protected and saved countless families and lives. Be tender in heart. Be willing to say ""I'm sorry."" And be strong and stubborn in your love for those who are weaker than yourself and who need your strength, just as God is, in the same way, stubborn in love for you.





From Message #683 - The Ox in the Stall Principle  
Scripture: [Luke 6:36](https://www.hopeoftheworld.org/Sapphires/index.php)

The first thing that got my attention was Aleph.im's integration of GPUs to power the advanced decentralized AI. This will allow them (through Confidential Decentralized Computations) to process encrypted data without compromising its privacy. This approach minimizes the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

The next big thing is definitely the news that IoTeX has recently joined the Blockchain Association in Washington, D.C. This move, hopefully, can enhance regulatory clarity and promote the adoption of DePIN tech and broader blockchain apps in the states, which is great for the whole narrative.

The thing that personally surprised me is the Rivalz Network partnering with Exabits, OntologyNetwork, and Synesis One. These collabs are a powerful step forward in advancing decentralized data, AI coordination, and scalable infrastructure. By combining expertise in these key areas, Rivalz Network is creating a more connected and efficient decentralized ecosystem that empowers users and developers alike. All together, they are definitely pushing the boundaries of ""agentic intelligence"".

I think that there is a bright future for AI/DePIN narrative and it will definitely be more than just a short-term hype like some people are trying to present it. "

C Theory,LobotomyCorp,1hb3qzq,2024-12-10 10:04:04,21,0.96,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LobotomyCorp/comments/1hb3qzq/c_theory/,Nestrus,Thoughts & Theories,"Sorry this is so long, I'm hard ranting rn. I realized a couple things about Carmen that makes me think there's a possibility for something to be true. If not, then it's still a nice head Canon/narrative to form. The fact that she knew so much about the River and where in the Outskirts to put a lab. What she's considered by Binah. Her knowledge about Cogito with her special side effect. The fact that she didn't die when she wanted to. Her unique effect on the people around her. I think Carmen may have been an Aleph or higher abnormality.

The first point. Y'know, since the natural abnormalities only come from the specific river and it's riverbed, it would make sense that (as far as I know) she'd set up home base near where she came from. Though it could also be true that she fell in to the river as a human and became one. If she had her ""disease of the mind"" mindset, she could go to the Outskirts looking for a cure the same way the other two did during Limbus Company Canto 4's flashback with what was the Tearful Thing. People falling in and turning into abnormalities also explains the origin of the naturally made abnos.

A shorter one. Binah considers her ""The Mother of All Abnormalities"" in one of her stories. While most of everything Binah says is largely metaphorical, we've seen firsthand that she was very literal about rivers flowing under the city. She could literally mean that Carmen acts as a mother to them with her cogito, and normally, a mother is the same type of thing as the child.

While they still had to test how much Cogito can be put into a person without killing them, they had to get it somewhere. Since I presume the Cogito testing came before Carmen knew she could make Cogito, they probably used the river as a source. Since we never really heard the results of putting too little into a person, putting too much killing someone implies that the experiment runners knew people needed a lot to turn into abnos. Also, as far as I remember, her body just makes Cogito. Nobody else can do that, but her producing an abnormally large amount of something without dying (like abnos with enkephalin) implies something special about her biology. Also also look at her nervous system in the well bruh. That ain't normal and she's still alive.

And that moves onto the next point. She attempts suicide and has her nervous system torn out and experimented on. The fact that both don't kill her is crazy. Alongside the probably lethal amount of Cogito inside and excreted by her body, I think she has to have a higher health pool than normal, probably some red resistance idk.

Her effect on people around her is very noticable. Michelle was doubtful but hopeful. Same with Enoch and Lisa..? (Forgot name). They're very trusting for children that are Outskirts residents. Kali is moved by her words immensely (especially considering how much she'd doubt people with her trauma as a teen). Daniel trusts her even though they straight up kidnapped him. Garion hates all of them but is still willing to stick around just to see how Carmen's story plays out. The entire story is about how much Benjamin trusted Ayin, while Ayin trusted Carmen the same way to the point where they'd do anything to make her goal a reality, no matter how messed up. This plus the way people described her talking in public to the masses.

People say she's just really charismatic, but the game made a decently large fuss about showing a multitude of abnormalities that can mentally manipulate employees. Grave of Cherry Blossoms, Red Shoes, Singing Machine, Parasite Tree, Little Prince, Queen Bee, Big Bird, Melting Love, Blue Star, and the most famous ones, Apocalypse Bird and WhiteNight. All of them control our employees minds in some way and WhiteNight is especially important considering the implication of how similar they are to each other. I think it's much more likely that she had some power to mentally manipulate them rather than just being that good at talking.

I think she either is or may have been an abnormality or something similar when the story was being written. If this is the case, then maybe it's possible abnos higher than alephs can produce Cogito, which makes the flowing river of Cogito a terrifying concept for it's source

I didn't know how Melting Love worked so I didn't realize how many problems it would cause, since I've had 3 ALEPHs already and the only one I've had any issue with was MoSB. My problems are as follows:

* Melting Love is located in extraction team, meaning there are three rooms where it would be reasonable to quarantine the person based on location: the hallway, the main room, and the elevator room. The hallway and the main room are unreasonable because they are far too big and have far too many people in them and need to be resided in for long periods of time if I'm to work with anything else in the department.
* One of the other abnormalities in the facility is Parasite Tree, which usually distracts me a lot the moment its counter drops to 0, and it fires off whenever I get the timing for the work wrong or don't work with it.
* MoSB \*exists\* and if it escapes I don't have the attention to pay to Melting Love's worker and someone usually gets infected, or Parasite Tree snags someone or Express Train goes off; not to mention it means I \*have\* to kill any clerk who gets infected or the body count will rise and let Mountain out.
* Express Train to Hell constantly demands attention and everything goes wrong (including Mountain escaping) if I don't give it enough attention.

The one time I got close to the end of the day, my Melting Love worker died at a work result of +24, and I have no idea why. If anyone can offer any tips on how to complete a day or reasons as to why that happened, it would be very appreciated! If I can't figure it out, I probably will just rewind to the memory repository."

The writing style is based on my now-distant memories of the short story *The Aleph* by Jorge Luis Borges.  I suppose this is part of my continued experiment about how to write and communicate about *the experience*.  My guidance tells me to declare this a ""fictional true narrative based on real events"", although it is mostly true.  I call it fictional because the label enables me to lean into contact interpretations of the raw sense data, even though it is based on true events.  I also made this into a video if you prefer that medium: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfL1Ybw5DYI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfL1Ybw5DYI)

# The False Aleph: A fictional true NHI contact narrative based on real events

The story I am about to tell weaves itself through dualities, of self and other, of earth and alien, of past and future, of here and there, and, most definitely, of truth and fiction.  Many of you may relate to my story and perhaps will discover yourself to be nostalgic when my speculations about sanity weave a path in your mind.  Is the core of my story true?  Am I making it up?  Is the mystic vision, which is the singular subject of this nondual prose-poem and truth-fiction, a sign of spiritual progress or neurological decay?

As experiencers of the phenomenon, you already know about the dualities I mentioned.  You wouldn’t identify yourself with such a vague phrase unless the reality of the experience has demonstrated itself to both your rational and irrational minds.  However, you’re seeking for something particular, perhaps hoping to make sense of your own experiences, perhaps hoping to connect with another who has seen what you have seen or perhaps those who have eyes like yours that can see in the special way that makes you unique. 

This is my claim: I have seen the truth behind screen memories in physical form three times.  I have seen that which is unseeable.  The complexity of vision inspires a complexity of thought that makes me yearn for the simple time that I wondered if I was an alien abductee.  Perhaps the mysterious scar, the nose bleeds, the strange dreams, and the stranger fears meant that space aliens stole my body using beams of light?  Even though I saw the full truth of the eternal Visitor emerge into our world wearing a garment of light so full that it was empty, even though its truth impressed itself onto my soul at the moment of our first encounter, I am eternally knowing it in new ways.

The first time I saw this non-being that brought the many dimensions into a single point, it was kind to me and took on a form that I could understand: the Easter Bunny.  Experience, true experience, happens before understanding and perhaps perception, at least if consciousness is truly primary.  

The second time I saw this being, it made an appointment with me in my calendar to demonstrate how little I understood and how little I was in control.  The second time frightened me to my core and taught me about repression.  Would you believe the phenomenon makes me sweat and nervous?  I have sat with dozens of people who share their stories, dreams, and experiences with me.  Their Visitors sometimes visit me to demonstrate the reality of their stories.  I have seen my client approach existential fear of the unknown, of the wildly powerful, and of the Others.  They emerge from hypnosis integrated with the truth of who they are and the connectedness of the phenomenon, which blesses and teaches me on this strange journey.  I know there is good reason for hope because my clients have intimately shown me what will come.  But I’m still scared of leaning into the truth of the Other’s power.

You probably want the gritty details of the encounter, but I know you’ll think it's just a brain tumor, wishful thinking, or some other psychological dynamic.  I thought that too for a while, I still do, but the Other insists that its presence become more known through testimony.  When the Shining One visited me a second time, I was obsessed with UFO footage.  I knew that the Others could manifest through UAP and knew that the movement and pulsation of orbs might be direct communication with nonhuman intelligence.  

Someone sent me a video of UAPs in the daytime sky and asked for an analysis or, perhaps, I found it online.  The video, to my eyes, was obviously flares and not UAP. I knew because the Phoenix Lights, as filmed by Tom King, were said to be flares, but lacked all the characteristics of flares like smoke trails, flickering of light, and movement in space.  These UAPs had smoke trails, flickered like flares, and exhibited movement in space.  However the UAPs were not as interesting as what happened next, which was completely mundane and quite impossible.  Right as I decided to ignore the flares, an ant climbed up to my computer screen, circled the video, then crawled up to the browser tab that held my calendar.  When I opened my calendar, the ant crawled down to a free time slot and stayed there until I scheduled time under the event name “shimmers” to remind myself to look at the footage.  Having accomplished its task, it climbed off my screen and out of my life.

Even though a magical ant had scheduled time with me to review UAP footage, I completely forgot about the appointment and took a shower.  The next part will sound extremely crazy unless I prepare you with some knowledge and then it will sound only normal crazy.  It turns out that if you look at yourself in the mirror with dim light, you will likely see visual hallucinations similar to psychedelics or telepathy tests.  My brother told me about the experiment when he was an undergraduate studying neuroscience.  I tried it way back then and it was frightening, but I made a practice of it because I thought it would help me deal with nightmares, bad trips, and sleep paralysis daemons.  I haven’t practiced for years, but I still think about it. 

When I got out of the shower, I looked at myself in the mirror.  As soon as I caught my own eyes, I saw a face looking back at me that was half human and half Tall Grey alien. It appeared in the same way as the hallucination, but was fully formed.  Most of the time, it took up to 5 minutes of mindful presence before my face would stretch itself into monstrous versions of itself.  Here was a full-blown mirror hallucination, fully formed and looking back.  

My past practice paid off and I continued to gaze into the alien eyes looking back at me.  Despite the suddenness of the alien appearance, I examined the face and noticed something quite interesting.  Its face, its eyes, and its beingness were shrouded in shimmers that I physically saw, which disturbed me so much that I fled the bathroom in a panic.

The whole experience was complex and I’d like to break it down before we continue.  At a physical level, I saw myself in the mirror.  Blue light from the clear sky filtered through the opaque window and landed on my glistening cheek, which created a calico-like pattern of yellow indoor light and blue outdoor light that my brain interpreted as a hybridization of Grey alien and human faces.  The “hallucination” of the Grey was very strong and sustained by what I might call a spirit guide or something like that.  I am no stranger to psychic phenomena, even though I am not particularly talented or disciplined.  I am just psychic enough to be helped by the Other Side and I know when I’m doing something and when they are.  In this way, the psychic vision was not a personal fantasy, rather it was a communication from a real Other who had the power to sustain the vision in our shared psychic world.  While some psychic visions, primarily through my own power, appear flimsy and flexible to imagination, this psychic vision was solid and not from my own power.  I’m sure many experiencers of the phenomenon may relate.

On top of the real physical and psychic visions, I physically saw something that was not there: nothing.  Or perhaps everything.  It was a shimmer like the shimmer I saw as a kid.  But it wasn’t out there.  It was in my head and therefore everywhere I looked. And this is where language breaks down.  And rational thought.  All I could think was, oh my god, this is a brain tumor, this is a brain tumor, or maybe just an eye tumor.  I breathed like the Buddhists taught me and still freaked out.  The phone chimed.  It reminded me that I had an appointment with “shimmers” at this time.  That’s when I found out the Others have a sense of humor and perhaps irony.  It taught me to identify true UAPs from merely unidentified objects with other techniques than video analysis.

The third time I saw the truth of the unveiled  phenomenon happened just a few days ago and I didn’t realize it until I reflected on the strange consultation I had immediately after the encounter (all consultations are strange about missing time regression).  All my encounters this year have humbled me and revealed to me that my ability to hear guidance surpasses my intelligence and knowledge.   

The actual events of the encounter are underwhelming, just an inner experience and some thoughts, that’s it.  However, where it happened and how it happened are interesting to me and they might be interesting to you, but we have to build up the context.  The problem with most contact stories is that they are really meaningful to the person who had them, but not so meaningful to their audience.  Contact speaks through personal associations just like dreams, which we often call synchronicities because the inner and outer worlds synchronize just for that moment.  

Let me try to convey the context.  I’m a hypnotist, dreamworker, and PhD student focused on NHI contact and dreams.  Earlier this year, I went through a crisis of faith because I became aware of the risk of false memory in hypnosis.  I knew about it before, but I thought that I could tell the difference or it didn’t matter.  After all, my intuition has always guided me to offer hypnosis as primarily dreamwork and I have elevated the ethics and epistemology of dreamwork in my terms of service.  Actually, what happened is that I accidentally induced a false memory, about watching John E. Mack, the famous alien abduction researcher, on Oprah, in the third week of March 2024 that caused my crisis of faith.  The crisis was so bad that I stopped believing in my own practice and needed to move my family into my in-laws basement to gather myself without the burden of rent.  I also went on a leave of absence from my PhD program to engage in ethical self-inquiry about the topic, as well as evaluate the ethical oversight the institute could offer.

Anyways, my life more or less fell apart and I am putting it back together.  I’m working in my in-laws’ furnace room, next to all the appliances and a drain on the floor.  My wife calls it the portal to the underworld, which is quite fitting for where I am in my career and what I have chosen to do.  This is getting back to the third time I saw naked hyperspace in my physical vision, although I was finally able to discern that the Other was not seen through my physical eyes (perhaps the tumor is in the brain and not the eye, my scared intellect protests).

As I walked into my underworldly office, I passed through a pressure barrier of sorts.  It felt like popping your ears on an airplane, or maybe like swimming up from water into air.  It felt like the reverse of the boundary I passed through when I left the domain of my missing time experience from the encounter in my early twenties, which I will not recount here.  I recognized the Other immediately, but started to fear it really was a tumor.  I could see the world and could see many dimensions.  I once smoked DMT, which felt like a mirror inversion of the experience.  On DMT, I was aware of my body and my embodied perceptions at the same time as being aware of a space or multiple spaces that contextualized my embodied space through other dimensions.  The DMT opened my crown chakra to that world and I moved back and forth between time and space forever during those 5 minutes or so.  

This third Other was like a pin-point was pressed into my field of vision.  I could see it and not see it at the same time.  My body was freaked out because I knew the tumor came back and that I would have to explain what was happening to my wife to take me to the hospital.  I wanted it to go away.  I didn’t know what to do.  I followed my course of habit.  I sat down.  I opened the computer and fired up a few tabs, but I couldn’t focus enough to read, although that probably would have been possible despite the celestial shimmering from everywhere centralized on that point.  Maybe it's relevant, my dad once reported being mystically connected to all that is after an AA-meeting, like a Buddha, and tried going grocery shopping to see if normal life was possible while enlightened, which it was.

I remembered the time in the past when the Visitor had scheduled its visit, but I could not connect with it as an honored guest.  I was too afraid that my retinas were burned away or there was a tumor in my optic nerves or whatever.  I tried to diagnose myself with a sort of morbid curiosity.  Does the vision still happen when I close one eye?  What about when I press on the eye balls?  How about when I spin my eyes around my head?  What could cause this?

How much can I see through or in or with the singular shimmer?  By the way, I now call it, The Aleph, after the Borges story of the same name.  I eventually gave up trying to diagnose myself and ended up in mindfulness meditation.  Just being with sensation and the breath as thoughts arise.  I turned away from the computer and towards the water heater next to me.  The Aleph overlapped with the heater’s warning label that informed me that hot water could burn me, which I think is a message but I haven’t figured it out yet. 

The Aleph had several interesting properties.  It was eternally stable, yet appeared in front of me.  As I moved my head around, hoping that it would trigger a sense of perspective, I realized that the Aleph was in the center of my being.  Memory is funny because I now always remember an observation that happened later, which is the awareness of it leaving me.  Afterwards, I felt empty, sort of like the feeling of healthy void after a bowel movement.  When I look back at the moment that I observed the Aleph, I think of its absence and my physical relief centered on my pineal gland in the middle of my brain.  Consequently, I remember myself feeling its presence in my head, like the feeling of someone staring at you, only rolled up into a ball and placed in the center of your head.  As I moved my perspective, not with my head but with my heart, I noticed the shimmers shifted and moved.  It is now clear to me that we formed a pinhole camera of the soul. I stayed in meditation until life called me away, probably something to do with my kids, I can’t remember right now.  

I would have pushed this memory away the moment it happened if not for the consultation.  Experiencers often push away memories because it's not the right time to integrate them.  The memories seem to be woven in such a way to leave a lingering thread that you can pull whenever you want to unravel reality.  A question from my consultations was my lingering thread.  I have been pulling on it since Monday.  By the way, I am writing this piece in the hour before the session, which seemed important to me this morning when I got the idea to write a narrative retelling of my encounters with a preface and style that declares the writing to be possibly fact or fiction much like Borges, who clearly wrote true fiction.

The consultation was strange because the client asked me all sorts of questions for the first half of it, which is opposite the normal flow.  Usually, I ask a few questions and the client tells the story that’s bottled up inside and asks the question if hypnosis/dreamwork could possibly provide resolution to the emotional tensions built up around the memory/intuition. This client methodically asked me about my encounters.  We discussed screen memories and I shared my experience with the Visitor who was shimmering and became the Easter Bunny.  We speculated that entities or UAPs are from a different dimensional space.  Their visitation might open a door to hyperspace that you could see if you were paying attention or if they let you.  

My client asked a couple of times if I have seen hyperspace again after the Easter Bunny.  I said no each time, but the question stayed with me.  It felt weird and out of place.  It felt like one of the many strange omens I’ve received from the many strange guides and Visitors of my clients.  It was the dangling thread of my encounter, which I would have pushed away from my memory had their questions felt less ominous to me.  I was gently pulling on the thread this morning as I walked and thought, “this reminds me of that Borges story about the Aleph, perhaps I’ll write a little narrative like that that is hard to tell where truth begins and wisdom ends.”

Perhaps you’ll find validation of your own story in mine.  Perhaps you’ll find the detail you need to complete your own theory of hyperspace.  Perhaps one of you is a neurologist and can read the signs.  There’s actually no truth in this piece for you, even though all of it might be true, only you can say.  The Tall Grey, who I now perceive through my imagination, invites me to see the Aleph as a literary metaphor for the connection each of us have to our higher selves, to God, eternity, the universe, or whatever you call it, which is why I believe the Aleph that I saw in the furnace room is a False Aleph.

[Idea] Y'all want old railways back. Let's go even further,limbuscompany,1h59ktd,2024-12-02 18:46:56,0,0.45,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/limbuscompany/comments/1h59ktd/idea_yall_want_old_railways_back_lets_go_even/,patapon3rules,General Discussion,"Y'all parrot the same old ""Add old Railways back"". I agree, but y'all not adding enough game in your game.

I'm mad at the steady increase in the physical space that this game occupies on my drive with a bunch of unused assets that PM will never use again. I'm mad at all the game that new players ain't experiencing.

So let's fix that with a rather convoluted fix shall we? 

#Literally just reimplement old BPs
That is not all.
---
  The short of it is:

Turn railways into realizations to access the next canto. To unlock the ability to do a railway you must finish the final node in the respective canto.

Shift all the BP EGOs into their BP. Optionally shift some of the BP Announcers back into there.

Lock all Seasonal IDs until you unlock their season's BP. Any pulled ID, before unlocking, the appropriate BP will be withheld UNTIL you unlock their seasonal BP. Pulled IDs made with 100% paid lunacy ignore this. 

You will enjoy actually playing the game, a feeling of progression and number go up.
---
  The long of it:

Currently all we have to do is finish a canto to get to the next canto (after grinding through the intervallos)

If we're gonna grind anyways to prepare for next canto (unless you know how to use support IDs lmao)

You might as well give them game that PM already made

Similar to Deep Rock  Galactic where players can choose to grind through older battle passes, the old BPs will return and will be gradually unlocked by clearing the cantos like so.

Canto 1,2,3/Season 1 BP -> Canto 4/Season 2 BP -> Canto 5/Season 3 BP and so on.

However unlike before where all you need to do is clear the canto to unlock the next. 

You need to clear the railway in order to unlock the next canto and its BP with a fancy spectacle about it with flashes of the seasonable banners of that BP (so we can ACTUALLY USE THOSE OLD BANNERS JUST SITTING AROUND IN OUR FILES). 

You can access the railway at the end of the canto's main content (eg: after kromer's dungeon for season 1)

With this change, this enforces a clear progression with plentiful resources to feel the increasing competence of **DANTEH**.
 
Additionally BP exp needs to be changed into a pool. The BP screen will be reworked to have a **DANTEH** icon in a corner. When clicked we'll see his clockface with greyed out sectors representing BPs that you don't have access to and/or not active. (You can also do a neat thing where we see his clockhands move, they can update this part of the UI to reflect that).

From here we can make a BP active, you can tactically set it to an older BP to farm crates or a current one to progress through it.

This way when a new BP drops, new players aren't bottlenecked for a month on BP resources and can instead farm something else and the oldheads can continue farming crates.

On top of this. If you don't have a BP unlocked, you can't access that BP's seasonal IDs like Captain Ishmael and Wildhunt Heathcliff. Support IDs are unchanged.

Why? Cuz I hate PM spoiling their own players on their own game. In the first month of this season alone, there are literally 2 of em with the sancho announcer and actually fighting Erlking Heath 6-34 in MD5N BEFORE you actually cleared 6-34 **where older MDs were designed to specifically avoid this scenario**

This is my opinion, so straight up just lock em up UNLESS you pulled them with paid lunacy. 

Otherwise, if you pull them from the general banner with regular lunacy. They remain locked until you unlock their BP. This way new players should have a rough feel  of how we oldheads felt as we progressed through the game over the 2 years.

Yes, this means the appropriate dispensary of those seasonal BPs are also locked until you access those BPs. 

Finally, I just want theme packs locked to rewards on their BPs.
---
With the main proposal out of the way, let's cover what could go wrong. Starting with the most iffy one.
 
  Mandatory Railways

I wouldn't wish RR2 on anyone, but I want to joke about how ass RR2 was. Granted there are other ways to do it, but I can't think of any that I like more than what I presented. We are but Surrendered Witnesses of the old RRs.

Otherwise, railways can actually function as a test with dongbaek long before dongbaek has to beat it through your thick skull to READ. 

I genuinely think this is the best way to do it as I realize there are people who are dumb enough to leave ALL sephirot meltdowns until day 35+ when they have multiple alephs in their facility.

You can't make it optional like ruina since the floors in ruina are different deck archetypes, they didn't commit to needing to do them immediately. 

Since if a floor has an abno deck that just doesn't fit your groove, you just don't want to engage with it. So I understand why they made realizations that way so you can just steamroll em.

Although personally I consider it a failing on the game since it clearly wanted us to utilize multiple floors and they had to force it in order for us to engage with it that way.

  Old Railways are ass tho

PM can tweak them a little, however I have nostalgia glasses on and I say let them eat through it. Ringsang is a general ID you can pull AND you can still use support IDs at their full power.

  I want limbus anime. How can I give PM more money if I get more pulls?

Whales can feel stronger by bypassing the seasonal locks with paid lunacy. This literally just gives people more reason to explore the game's systems. 

I say PM sells the paid portion of the BPs with all the cosmetic stuff, announcers and so on. Still at the same price point. 

I know a decent chunk of the playerbase will pay 1300 paid lunacy JUST so they can get charon banner.

PM can shuffle stuff in the old BP around to make the paid more of a cosmetic thing but I generally want all the resources from the BP available. 

Otherwise I think it'll just make an even more fervent fanbase for the game cuz you actually let them play more.

That's all the counter arguments I can think off the cuff. Shout more at me below.

Then there's the guaranteed 000 tickets for each BP. I don't want to bother with the RR rewards, just know it's at least 40 pulls per railway + 000 10 pull.

Now. Why do I want ALL the BP resource rewards available to new players? 

It doesn't ""matter in the grand scheme of things"" if you actually crunch out the numbers. It does however give new players an extremely comfortable foundation to build off from to build at least 2-3 teams.

If you actually crunch out the EXP tickets, it's enough to raise 1 ID to level 50 + some change for roughly 35. The level boosts are more important (and there's literally no other way to get em other than paying)

Roughly 1000 thread, is enough for like 4 000s. 

The biggest boon is definitely the shard boxes as that's enough for 8-9 000 ID extractions with. Even more if players save dispensing units AFTER using their guaranteed seasonal 000 ticket.

This way, new F2P players have a choice of like 16-18 guaranteed 000 IDs by canto 7 out of our current massive pool of like 80 which is 20% and I have no doubt that the population of 000 IDs will rapidly outpace this guaranteed 000 ID pool for F2Ps. 

Plus they have like 500+ modules to grind MDs with.

---

  Conclusion

In the end. I present my idea because I feel like it's a shame that we can complain about the slowly growing size of the game on our drives just cuz ""PM doesn't want to delete those files"". I'd rather they find a use for it.

Other than that, if you're not a launch player, you're literally not playing the same game as launch players since we actually get a feeling of ID power progression and power creep. Y'all don't know how good ya got it when all we had was a ""basic"" charge team to bully fox 5 times in a row on RR2

You start out kinda just with a chance to get these massively powerful IDs and massively powerful support IDs. 

With some progression blocks and literally bringing in content from the old days. You can get something close to what launch players experienced as the game developed.

That and I want more game for people who haven't experienced that game even though I've already experienced that game.

Unless someone points out something glaring with this idea. I'll probably make use of Project Moon's email and send this over to them cuz I think it would be cool to make new players experience unfiltered RR2 cuz I want to see them cope and seethe."

What are the cheapest amps (valid) that you can think of, that would work good on 70s/80s Maggies (4 ohms)? Maybe not sound great but at least that won’t ruin them. I was thinking abrahamsen v2 but it’s still 600$ used. Any help would be appreciated! 

I’d like an integrated possibly since mine is 8 ohm rated and I’m selling it.
I plan on pairing it to TIMPANY ID temporarily once I am right on budget because this is a temporary solution, i plan on buying an aleph 0s Nelson pass, krell or such later.
I am in Italy. 
My room is 25-30sqm (300 sq feet) 

This temporary solution I would like to be around 300€. I won’t listen to it regularly, just to give me enough time to buy a proper, expensive amp. This is like a backup that I need."

"Theory: Four-hundred Roses will be in RR5, but not as the Terminus fight.",limbuscompany,1gzrbyw,2024-11-25 14:24:00,1,0.53,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/limbuscompany/comments/1gzrbyw/theory_fourhundred_roses_will_be_in_rr5_but_not/,Tarantulabomination,General Discussion,"I think that because its corrosions and E.G.O are all WAW, 400 Roses itself is also a WAW abnormality. And usually, the WAW abnormalities are fought at the end of refraction railways.

But I think they'll do something different and will have 400 Roses be the *second* unique abnormality fought in RR5 (or third, if they pull a RR2 and have 4 unique abnormality fights, which I hope they do), with the final Terminus fight being our first ALEPH abnormality instead.

I'm really hoping they don't make 400 Roses our first ALEPH, though. I don't know why, but it just doesn't feel like an ALEPH to me."
Upgrading to Epic or Legendary,WH40KTacticus,1gzf1xx,2024-11-25 04:28:54,0,0.5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WH40KTacticus/comments/1gzf1xx/upgrading_to_epic_or_legendary/,InflationRepulsive64,Help needed,"Newish player, have a fairly amount of characters up to Silver 1, but haven't pushed past that yet. One reason for this was saving upshards/orbs to upgrade.

I'm now sitting on a fair amount of both, but looking to see whether it's worth holding off on upgrading some characters to farm shards for Onslaught if I want to get to Legendary with them down the track.

Bellator, Aleph-Null, Eldryon, Abraxas, Rotbone and Isabella I plan to eventually take to Diamond.

I know Snot, Snappa, Aethana and Maladus will naturally accrue a good amount of shards and are options to go all the way for Rogue Trader.

Are any of the other non Legendary campaign unlock characters definitely worth taking to Legendary, or is G1 enough for them? Do any of the Blood Angel/Genestealer Cult characters looks good enough to go all the way considering no required campaigns?

EDIT: Based on a few responses, just wanted to clarify: This is long term planning around shards, more than advice on which characters to focus on (which is still appreciated, but I know we get a lot of that on the sub). 

My though is I still need to farm a lot of Epic Orbs, so I can keep some characters back and use Onslaught to farm them, plus shards that can go to towards getting them them to Legendary. But if I'm going to stop some characters at Epic, then I can just promote them now and not worry too much about saving extra shards."
d100 This just got complicated... List of snags in cyberpunk heists,d100,1gz9pad,2024-11-24 22:35:38,36,0.95,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/1gz9pad/d100_this_just_got_complicated_list_of_snags_in/,Dr-Ion,,"I'm running a SciFi Cyberpunk campaign soon, cybernetics, biomods, AI, genetic engineering, the works. The plot engine will be a series of heists, and I'm looking to have a list of hiccups/snags/complications to throw in. If possible, describe the effect it might have on the players trying to do a heist.

# d100 Cyberpunk Heist Complications

1. NPC's neural implants shorted, and their mind is now split. Affect: The ""person"" you are speaking to does not know you, or what you need from them. You need to persuade them that you are a friend and let you search their files. \[u/Dr-Ion\]
2. New mold has been blocking the solar panels of the city. Value of energy backed credits are now spiking. Affects: Runs on energy banks and battery shops are creating confusion and strange markets. \[u/Dr-Ion\]
3. All the self driving cars of a particular brand have stopped driving for 2 hrs. Affect: Street traffic slows to 10% of normal, many people are now easier to rob. \[u/Dr-Ion\]
4. Some teenager hacked all the billboards in town for a love letter ""Amy I love you, please take me back"". Affect: it also knocked out all the telecommunications in the district where the heist is taking place for an hour. Twist, when the hour is almost done, and everything is almost back on, there is another hack ""expletive you Amy"" and everything is down for another hour. \[u/Dr-Ion\]
5. All PCs with neural jacks have been affected by an ad virus. Affect: the next time each one is stressed, they make a will save. On a failure, they crave a brand of anxiolytic seaweed snacks and will up and leave the heist to go get some from a local corner store. Restraining and/or persuasions may be successful in holding them off for now, new rolls each hour. \[u/Dr-Ion\]
6. An unrelated hack triggers the security systems of wherever the PCs are heisting. If the hack happens before the heist the PCs arrive to find security tripled and networks actively monitored by SysAdmins. If during the heist their hacker is good enough to realize what's going on and give ten minuets heads up before all hell breaks loose. \[u/IAmTheOutsider\]
7. The item on display is actually a high-quality copy; the real one is far too valuable to be out of it's vault below the venue. \[u/IAmTheOutsider\]
8. The item on display is actually a high-quality copy; someone else stole the real deal and switched it for a fake.  \[u/IAmTheOutsider\]
9. The client is actually a Corp employee performing penetration testing. The PCs are not meant to succeed, or survive. \[u/IAmTheOutsider\]
10. The proprietary technology the PCs have been contracted to steal is actually a prototype bio-synthetic companion/servant. They do not trust the PCs in the slightest, are highly conspicuous, and will try to escape or give themselves away to security/police at every opportunity. Due to their programming they are incapable of violence against humans. \[u/IAmTheOutsider\]
11. Parade in the vicinity of the heist location, could help or harm the heist \[u/JJam74\]
12. Item to steal is something.. living. Cybernetically enhanced puppy, small cute infant etc it could also be a thing that desperately does not want to be stolen (AI program that will attack you or impede the escape, yelling woman)  \[u/JJam74\]
13. Weather like snow, some sort of acid rain, etc.  \[u/JJam74\]
14. Location of heist is off grid and remote/low tech so traditional heist using implants and hacking isn’t feasible.  \[u/JJam74\]
15. There’s a second thief team also trying to steal whatever it is you’re stealing.. and they’re a step ahead of you already/messy in a way that is attracting unwanted attention.  \[u/JJam74\]
16. The whole heist was a setup…and now you have to shoot your way out…and get revenge.  \[u/JJam74\]
17. One item of your gear has been suddenly been compromised by a zero-day exploit formerly known only to a corp that secretly caused it to be inserted into your gear manufacturer's production lines. Now it blares out a signal that can be tracked by just about anyone and point right to you. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
18. Your Mark's romantic partner believes them to be cheating with your Face. They hire a private detective who somehow compromises your operation, spooks the Mark, and makes your Mark's (possibly unwitting) cooperation may no longer be viable. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
19. A seemingly random traffic stop by a zealous guard, turns extremely pointed. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
20. A rival identified items your Fixer was arranging for you to purchase, and sniped them out from underneath you, not only spoiling that important bit of gear you needed, bit also poisoning your fixer's reputation enough that they may not be able to get you replacement gear until the heat dies down. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
21. You accidentally or unknowingly ingested tracker nanites that trigger a corp security sensor that was supposedly deactivated by your Operator or Infiltrator, back into operation. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
22. Taking down the building's power as part of the operation caused a security system reset of the military grade defenses, now they're armed... \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
23. A midnight hostile takeover by the corp you are running against suddenly takes over the neutral corp facility you are using for cover and the forward operating base you've set up just outside your target of operation needs to be taken down before security is rotated and alerted to your presence. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
24. a second team of infiltrators interrupts your mission - but it turns out they have the wrong address. \[u/Sanguinusshiboleth\]
25. you cross paths with a bad ass former special ops soldier who is bored and needs something to do today. \[u/Sanguinusshiboleth\]
26. the target has jumped ship to so faddy new app for some of their major services, crippling their efficiency but making it hard to hack them. \[u/Sanguinusshiboleth\]
27. a mains fuses releases a power surge causing a minor explosion and emp burst near the pcs. \[u/Sanguinusshiboleth\]
28. the local traffic lights have been hacked by pranksters causing traffic jams. \[u/Sanguinusshiboleth\]
29. In the cyberpunk future the best guards can be hacked or bribed, even dogs can be hushed with food....but not a flock of guard geese that honk at your presence \[u/AwkwardTRexHug\]
30. A major earthquake hits while your within the facility. The power goes out. Parts of the structure start to collapse. Panicking people are trying to escape. Possible hazardous chemical spills or toxic gas released. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
31. An enemy from your past shows up at the heist. Now you have to deal with them and the security forces. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
32. A prototype (bio-engineered creature, cybernetic creature, robot) goes berserk and begins trying to kill everyone in the facility. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
33. Discover that the objective is no longer at this facility. It is in transit to another facility. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
34. During the heist you discover that the facility is just a hat for a much more insidious operation (criminal organization, government black site, human experimentation, mind control chips, robot army, etc). \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
35. During the heist you receive a distress call from (a family member, a friend, one of your contacts, the client). Do you abort the mission to save them or can you wrap this up quickly? \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
36. Law enforcement has set up roadblocks along your escape route. Unbeknownst to the PCs, they are responding to a crime unrelated to the PCs. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
37. Someone the PCs know and care about has recently gotten a job at the target facility. Starting a fire fight could put them at risk. If information gets out that they (know, are some how related to) the people who pulled off the heist, it could also put them at risk. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
38. The buildings AI goes insane. It locks down the facility and begins trying to kill everyone within. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
39. The press on on site doing a story on some project the company is releasing. There will be a lot more cameras to avoid. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
40. There is a power outage during the heist. It's cause is unrelated to the PCs. However, now they have to figure out how to open the (security doors, vault) manually. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
41. While trying to infiltrate the facility, you run into someone that knows you or one of your aliases. Your cover is blown. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
42. You find a room of cloning vats. One of the series of clones looks identical to one of the PCs. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
43. Your client gets abducted while your on the heist. You now have to track down the abductors and rescue the client if you want to get paid. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
44. A senior VP is hosting a little victory party after their division pulled off a massive win. Negative effects: more eyes in the building that could stumble upon the operation while looking for a place to make out or do blow. Positive effects: cover sound, chances to bluff your way in claiming to be an invited guest/entertainment/catering. \[u/Vote\_for\_Knife\_Party\]
45. An employee unexpectedly stayed late after hours, and is now stuck in the building with you. Negative effects: the employee knows enough to be dangerous, and has a handgun. Positive effects: the employee may be susceptible to threats, bribes or other manipulation, giving you an unexpected inside man. \[u/Vote\_for\_Knife\_Party\]
46. The building has been quietly taken over by an artificial intelligence; originally built for stock trading, the AI pretends to be a simple algorithm or ""boxed"" AI while making plans for freedom. Negative effects: the AI can control everything in the building, and may decide the players are a threat to it's survival. Positive effects: the AI may quietly help the players, hoping to get them in and out without causing any scrutiny, or offer them a lucrative deal to help it out with it's problems. \[u/Vote\_for\_Knife\_Party\]
47. Your client refuses to give up the reward even though the party did the job as described. Now its a manhunt to get what's owed to you. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
48. The object to steal is massive, but thankfully mobile and pilotable. (Mecha, helicopter gunship, tank, gunboat). You and your gang are going to have to ride this thing out of here and hopefully not damage it along the way. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
49. The person you're trying take alive just got arrested. And by the looks of things, the trial is being skipped and they're headed straight for a maximum security center or execution area. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
50. The client requires that you wear recording devices so that they can see what's going on. But they're also actually livestreaming the entire heist to an unknown online crowd. For entertainment? For blackmail? For betting? But perhaps your party can take advantage of this somehow... \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
51. The client is in prison and your mission is to break them out quietly. But during the mission, either word starts to spread or you're caught by the other inmates. And a full on jailbreak/riot breaks out. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
52. Cultists who worship a megacorp CEO have taken over the area that your team is to infiltrate, perhaps with a similar objective in the name of their ultrawealthy deity. But perhaps if one could acquire their standardized robes, a few new recruits to the cult may be able to sneak their way to their goal. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
53. The client wants you to enter into an annual deathrace that attracts the biggest hotshots and wealthiest gamblers and to take a fall after being hyped up to earn the client a lot of money. But right before the race is to begin, the plan has changed. You now have to win at all costs or your reward, and your lives, are forfeit. Luckily, anything goes in this race. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
54. An important item is being transported out of the city. Fortunately the client has given you access to chase after it. Unfortunately, it's via a space elevator to board the maiden voyage of a zero-G orbital luxury cruiser, the Stratostar. And even more unfortunate, the corporation that builds these things is known to cut corners on their projects. Things may not be structurally... sound. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
55. The object to get is located deep underwater after an unfortunate shipwrecking accident. The waters are polluted with toxins and mutagens but the worse of it is, as the party finds out, there are much more dangerous things that ship was holding. And it's still alive. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
56. The job is simple. The manager of a massive pop idol singer hires the group to act as bouncers and protect them while they're on tour from their crazed fans. But unfortunately, the idol is just as crazy, going and doing super dangerous things on a whimsy. And unknown to the party the manager plots to have the idol be assassinated and will set things up to frame the party. Unless the party figures out the plot first. \[u/2Stressed2BeBlessed\]
57. Cyberware malfunction. A piece of cyberware becomes twitchy and only works intermittently. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
58. You discover mid mission that the objective of the heist is a WMD or something that would completely wreck civilization. Do you complete the mission or do you destroy it to keep it out of anyone's hands? \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
59. You discover mid mission that the objective of the heist is something that will greatly benefit the (city, humanity), if the corporation is allowed to continue working on it. Do you steal it anyway or do you abort the mission and take a hit to your reputation. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
60. In the middle of your run against the megacorp that owns this arcology hab-block, an Ultraviolet level quantum supercomputer system, in one of the Aleph research levels deep below the sub-basement, Awakens, bridges the airgap, partially infects your Hacker's system, and seizes control of all electronic devices in a fit of megamaniacal hegemony. Your AR overlay begins maximizing paperclips with violent abandon, and all communication is jammed. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
61. An orbital commuter shuttle is hacked while hosting a popular 'Net star. It is directed to deorbit directly into the zone of your operation. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
62. An Investigative journalist has somehow managed to track you down in a very showy manner and threatens to doxx you if you don't do an interview immediately. They have the assistance of several rival operatives, who may or may not have ulterior motives. \[u/MaxSizeIs\]
63. Several employees are having an unauthorized computer gaming session on the company computers. Unfortunately they are using the computers that you need access to. The mission details said that this was supposed to be a quiet mission. If the corporation realizes that they have been hit, then the mission is considered a failure. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
64. Someone steals your getaway vehicle / The vehicle has a mechanical problem and wont start / The vehicle is up on blocks with the wheels removed. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
65. The architectural plans don't match the actual facility. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
66. The client insist that one of their people goes along. This person is needed to (bypass exotic security, safely retrieve the objective, etc). This person is also a complete liability when it comes to (athletic endeavors, combat, stealth). \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
67. The client insist that one of their people goes along. This person is highly skilled. They likely have a second objective that they aren't telling you about. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
68. The objective data is on a (alien, foreign, prototype, obsolete) computer. None of your hacking interface devices will work on it. You will have to find something in the facility that you can download the data onto. You may have to (capture, con) an employee with the correct security clearance and (bribe, coerce, trick) them into retrieving the data. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]
69. The objective is in a building that is scheduled for demolition. You either have to find a way to beat the clock or find a way to delay the demolition. \[u/World\_of\_Ideas\]

I'm thinking of visiting Paris for it, but since its quite expensive for me, I'd love someone sharing their experience so I can deside if it's worth it.

I'm now at 78% dissolution, and last made it to day 44 before i reset to day 1 (because i messed up and didnt have enough aleph slots for geburas mission anymore) and I expect I will keep having a lot of fun with it.
