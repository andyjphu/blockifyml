Working with a kitsune as a American.,witchcraft,1i9xgxq,2025-01-25 16:24:58,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1i9xgxq/working_with_a_kitsune_as_a_american/,The_13th_Moon_,Help | Experience - Insight,"This will be controversial I'm sure. Recently I have been having dreams of foxes, I have been wanting to work with a spirit animal for some time and foxes started popping up randomly in my life in a number of ways. I adventually did some divination and found that the fox spirit or a fox spirit was wanting to work with me. 

Now, at frist I thought it was just a fox spirit I was making contact with. But recently I had a dream about a fox with multiple tails and a mask covering its face. I feel so strongly that this was a spirit, so I did more divination and basicly came down to it being a kitsune. 

I do not want to appropriate the Japanese/Chinese traditions, nor do I want to appropriate any culture I am not a part of. But I would be lying if I said this didn't feel incredibly important. So I bring the question to you. Can I as a American work with this spirit or should call it something else? Reguardless I will be working with the fox spirit, but perhaps calling it a kitsune will change. 

What are your thoughts? "

My Botox doesn’t last like it used to…,45PlusSkincare,1i9xc7m,2025-01-25 16:19:12,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/45PlusSkincare/comments/1i9xc7m/my_botox_doesnt_last_like_it_used_to/,Ok_Branch_127,,"At 45 my Botox just doesn’t last like it used to. I’ve been doing it regularly for a decade and while I’ve never gotten the longevity many have, I feel like 10 weeks in and I’m seeing the effects fade. 

I see a lot of advice to ride out Botox as long as I can before switching to an alternate, but I don’t know how much truth there is in that. I’m trying to wait as long as I can between appointments - usually 5+ months at this point.

I use retinol a couple times a week (tret was too drying) and started using a Solawave red light mask back in November which has fortunately given me that post-Botox glow I’m chasing. Other than that, my regular moisturizer and sunscreen. I try to drink a lot of water and stay out of the sun. And not frown too much haha.

Anything I can do to prolong the life of Botox or is this just what happens over time?"
How To Be Loud at the Game,KansasCityChiefs,1i9xb3s,2025-01-25 16:17:50,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/1i9xb3s/how_to_be_loud_at_the_game/,wolphcore,DISCUSSION,"
[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/s/ZwArjJHl34)

As I mentioned yesterday, **our crowd truly does impact the game like an invisible 12th man on defense, and there is no reason why we shouldn't perform just as well at our 12th man duties as the other 11 players on the field**, and so I decided to start a daily post to put out some advice to other crowd-goers to make sure the 12th man is humming like thirty seven monster trucks in the Sprint Center.

Yesterday I wrote about the ""When"" of **Being as Loud as Possible**. Read more about it in yesterday's post, but in summary, be loud during:

1. Offensive Play-calling (QB with his hands over his ears)
2. Offensive Huddle
3. QB Cadence (Offense lined up)

Today, I will be writing about the ""How"" of being loud. I just popped my sleeping pills, so this post will be a little more brief and serious than yesterday's because I have to get through this one before I start thinking its a good idea to write posts on reddit.

  
So with that, let's get started.

# How to Be Loud

Just like yesterday, I'm going to break this down into parts. How to be loud can be summarized in:

1. Prepare & Warm up
2. This is a Marathon
3. Don't be Muffled

**Prepare & Warm up**

It is a good idea to get and stay hydrated. Don't lose your voice the night before.

As for right before the game, do you see what the athletes do about 90 minutes before they game out on the field? That's called *warming up*, and as the 12th man it is your responsibility to do the same for your voice.

I'll be honest, I'm not a pro at this particular skill, so I'm not going to give a precise routine. But what I will say is, in every sport, warmups involve very light activity (so talking or humming in this case) to get the muscles warm. So talk lightly and humm lightly to get and keep the vocal chords warm.

**This is a Marathon**

Imagine the Chiefs are up by 2 in the 4th quarter with 5 minutes left, but the Bills have the ball on their 27. Josh Allen has put his hands over his helmet to hear the play (part 1 of WHEN to be loud), and you start yelling... oh wait, what's that, you lost your voice, and nobody can hear you? ""The twelfth man is in the tent with the trainers, and I don't think he will becoming back in."" announces Jim Nantz. ""Oh I don't knowwww, Jim."" Chimes Romo.

Morgan Freeman: Romo really didn't know.

...

Let's be real, you don't want to find yourself in the above situation. You are a marathoner in this event, or maybe a mountaineer. You want to selectively choose times to be the most intense, but just like a marathoner falling over the finish line, you want to lose your voice when that red and yellow confetti blasts into the air.

You may be tempted to use your ""head voice"" but you can probably use your ""chest voice"" for longer.

**Don't be Muffled**

""Everybody is going to be wearing a ski mask. People aren't going to be standing and cheering. They're going to be huddled. Wearing wool. Trying to stay warm. Wearing something over their mouths. Home-field advantage via the crowd... DONE."" - Colin Cowherd, about Chiefs fans in the playoffs (thanks to some commenters who pointed this out yesterday - [Different-Package200](https://www.reddit.com/user/Different-Package200/)  
 and [Ka-Is-A-Wheelie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ka-Is-A-Wheelie/)).

Please stay warm, but remember this quote if you decide to keep your mouth covered by a ski mask while yelling at the Bills from 80 yards away.

# Closing Remarks

To summarize, the three parts of HOW to be loud are:

1. Prepare & Warm up
2. This is a Marathon
3. Don't be Muffled

That's all I got for the main topic of today. As I put out these posts, some of the ideas are evolving a bit. One of the commenters yesterday ([pornokitsch](https://www.reddit.com/user/pornokitsch/)) pointed out that there have been Chiefs home games where the crowd went silent during the huddle, and that this felt like a missed opportunity. I don't know about you, but I don't want that to be the case this coming Sunday. The fewer people who know the three parts of WHEN to be loud ([Day 1 Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/1i72ajn/day_1_of_posting_12th_man_strategy/)) the greater risk there is of missing this opportunity (hint: share that post, or heck, repost it. I don't care).

Luckily I got through this post before the sleeping pills kicked in too hard. Talk to you loons tomorrow."

Star Rail + Fate: light discussion and a little imagination...,HonkaiStarRail,1i9x9cz,2025-01-25 16:15:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1i9x9cz/star_rail_fate_light_discussion_and_a_little/,Ok-Respect4472,Discussion,"Well, as we all know, around the last quarter, we will have a Honkai Star Rail Collab with Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, I and everyone hope that this Collab will be very successful and that we will have other interactions between Moon Type and Hoyoverse, I decided to release this article to do 2 things: 

1- Speculate on the future of Fate + Star Rail;

2- make a little joke...



1-) Future Collabs:



I imagine that, if this 1st Collab is successful, I think it's almost certain that we'll have Collabs with the other Fate games animated by Ufotable, that is, Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel and Fate/Zero.



As for Heaven's Feel, I imagine that first we would have a "" Rerun "" of the characters from the first Collab ( possibly Artoria and EMIYA ), in addition to new characters, which I believe could be Shirou, Rin, Sakura and Illya on the path of Remembrance, which could even be cool ( I don't know about you, but I would throw in a Sakura banner that summons Medusa ).



In the case of Fate/Zero, I think the best bet would be: Gilgamesh, Kiritsugu and Iri with a Lancelot Skin for Firefly.





2-) A collab of Honkai Star Rail with Fate/Grand Order:



We got to where I wanted, I don't know about you, but in this Collab, I would like the plot to involve a Grail war in the style of "" Fate/Apocrypha "", that is, 14 masters, 2 Sabers, 2 Archers, 2 Lancers, 2 Riders, 2 Casters, 2 Assassins, 2 Berserkers and 2 Rulers, being a confrontation of Fate x Star Rail, however, with masters and servants all mixed together, the original reason for this post is to make a "" lineup "" of masters with their potential servants + some alternative options:



Masters ( SR ):



1-) Trailblazer ( The reasons are obvious );

Servants (Fate): Astolfo, Oda Nobunaga, Elizabeth Báthory and any Servant with "" Chaotic "" alignment.

Servants (SR): Firefly, Guinaifen, Hook, Sushang and any "" eccentric "" character.



2-) March 7th;

Servants (Fate): Osakabehime, Paris, Illya (Fate Prisma Illya), Sei Shōnagon.

Servants (SR): Fugue/Tingyun, Guinaifen, Misha.



3-) Dan Heng;

Servants (Fate): Bedivere, Nagao Kagetora, Georgios and Leonidas I.

Servants (SR): Bailu, Hanya, Xueyi.



4-) Sparkle ( The moment the ""Masked Fools"" or ""Aha"" knew about the Grail War, they would enter to cause chaos );

Servants (Fate): Medea, Gilles de Rais, Mephistopheles, Lancelot, Heracles, Mori Nagayoshi, Barghest, Baobhan Sith.

Servants (SR): Jingliu, Mydei, Blade.



5-) Kafka;

Servants (Fate): Hassan of the Serenity, Jack the Ripper, Mordred and Asterios.

Servants (SR): Silver Wolf, Firefly, Blade.



6-) Aventurine;

Servants (Fate): Gilgamesh, James Moriarty and Shuten Dōji.

Servants (SR): Dr. Ratio and Jade.

 

7-) Phantylia;

Servants (Fate): Cú Chulainn (Alter), Morgan, Artoria (Alter).

Servants (SR): Cocolia, Fugue/Tingyun, Blade, Jingliu.





Others:

Robin ( Only if her servant is Nero Claudius ), Gallagher ( Only if Kiritsugu participated ), Black Swan.





Masters ( Fate ):



1-) Shirou;

Servants (SR): Acheron, Fugue/Tingyun, Xueyi and Yukong.



2-) Rin;

Servants (SR): Jing Yuan, Seele and Yunli.



3-) Kirei;

Servants (SR): Blade and Mydei.



4-) Ritsuka Fujimaru;

Servants (SR): Gepard, The Herta and Sampo.



5-) Emiya Kiritsugu;

Servants (SR): Acheron, Boothill, Gallagher, Moze and Xueyi.



6-) Ayaka Sajyou ( Fate/SF );

Servants (SR): Fugue/Tingyun, Rappa, Hanya, Xueyi and Tribbie.



7-) Sieg;

Servants (SR): Clara, Lingsha and Aglaea."

The twin suns of Tatooine dipped low on the horizon, painting the desert town of Mos Espa in hues of orange and crimson. Watto, the winged Toydarian merchant, locked up his shop after another successful day of haggling and bartering. His pouch of credits jingled pleasantly as he floated back to his small home behind the storefront, ready to enjoy a quiet night.

As he settled into his chair with a mug of ale, the oppressive silence of the evening struck him. Usually, the distant hum of podracers or the chatter of locals filled the air. Tonight, there was nothing. The stillness felt unnatural, like the desert itself was holding its breath.

Watto’s wings twitched uneasily. “Eh, must be the heat messing with me,” he muttered, taking a long sip.

Then came the noise—a faint clattering from the back of his shop. His wings buzzed as he leapt into the air, heart racing.

“Who’s there?!” he barked, his voice echoing in the quiet. “I ain’t got time for thieves!”

No answer.

Grabbing a rusted hydrospanner from the counter, Watto cautiously hovered toward the back room. The crates of spare parts seemed untouched, but the dim light cast long, unsettling shadows over the cluttered space. One of the crates had fallen over, its contents scattered across the floor.

“Hmph, just the wind,” Watto grumbled, trying to convince himself.

He began picking up the parts when the room grew colder—unnaturally so. The air seemed to thicken, pressing down on him like an invisible weight. Then came the sound: a deep, guttural breathing, slow and deliberate.

Watto froze. His eyes darted around the room, searching for the source, but the shadows seemed to shift and dance, playing tricks on his mind.

“Who’s there?” he called out, his voice trembling now. “I’ll…I’ll call the authorities, you hear?”

The breathing grew louder, closer, until it seemed to echo inside his head. A shadow detached itself from the corner of the room, looming taller and darker than anything Watto had ever seen. His wings flapped wildly as he backed into a pile of junk, his hydrospanner slipping from his grasp.

“Stay back! Stay away from me!”

The figure stepped into the faint light. It was clad in black armor, its face hidden behind a gleaming, featureless mask. A crimson blade hissed to life in its hand, casting the room in an eerie red glow.

Watto’s mouth went dry. He had seen strange beings in his time, but this…this was something else entirely. The figure’s very presence radiated malice, a suffocating aura that crushed any thought of resistance.

“A demon,” Watto whispered, his voice barely audible. “You’re a demon, come to punish me.”

The figure tilted its head, as if considering his words. Then it raised a gloved hand, and Watto felt an invisible force seize him by the throat. He gasped and flailed, his wings beating uselessly as he was lifted off the ground.

“Please!” Watto croaked. “I don’t know what I did, but—”

“You exploited the weak,” the figure intoned, its voice deep and mechanical, like the sound of a thousand souls crying out in unison. “You enslaved the innocent.”

Watto’s eyes bulged as the grip tightened. “No! No, I just…it’s business! Just business!”

The demon-like figure stepped closer, its crimson blade humming ominously. “Your sins have caught up to you, Toydarian.”

Watto’s vision blurred as the pressure on his throat grew unbearable. In his final moments, he clawed at the air, staring into the faceless mask of his executioner. The last thing he heard was the slow, rhythmic breathing, like the desert wind carrying whispers of death.

When the suns rose the next day, the shop was silent, its doors left ajar. The locals whispered about the strange noises in the night and the cold wind that swept through Mos Espa. No one dared to enter.

Deep in the shadows of the desert, Darth Vader disappeared into the dunes, his mechanical breathing fading into the endless sands."

As I found an eth 5 sox Decapitator and the runes are no issue, I want to make a Fury Druid, especially since the only other melee char I play is a Trav Horker, so I do not feel like making another caster.

Coincidentally, I found a Charm rune and a superior (12% ED) Totemic Mask with +3 Fury, +2 Shock Wave and +2 Fissure. While the other skills are irrelevant, Furry seems nice. So I was thinking about making a Metamorphose helm.

I did some IAS calculation, and my initial plan before finding the Cham was using a Hustle GT on swap to proc BOS. This way I would need 50 IAS for 3 frame Fury, which I could achieve with LOH, Highlor's and Nosferatu's Coil. If using Meta over Jalals, I could use the IAS from the Werebear Swap instead.

My questions would be: Is the Meta setup really better than Hustle on Swap? It feels more inconvenient to constantly change forms than just doing a couple hits on swap weapon every few minutes. If I use Meta, what am I using on swap? Harmony Bow? I do not want to use CTA. I only have the one Cham currently, and if I go with Hustle I would probably either use it for my Barbs Arreats or maybe make a Plague sword for an A5 merc.

Which setup would you use?"
Memory Recall: The Depths of Lumon,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1i9x5yx,2025-01-25 16:11:28,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1i9x5yx/memory_recall_the_depths_of_lumon/,Mysterious-Monkey-72,Theory ,"# Sensory Cues for Memory Recall

In S1, Harmony was experimenting with various sensory cues to try and trigger Mark’s and Irv’s memory.

## SIGHT

 - **Artwork** - Burt was hanging Irv’s favorite artwork.

 - **Tree** - I suspect the tree in the Wellness Center was intended for Mark. 

 - **Blueprints** - We didn’t get to see them, but she showed Mark a set of blueprints.

## SMELL

 - **Gemma’s candle** - self-explanatory. 

## SOUND

 - **Birds chirping** - I think the birds chirping in the Wellness Center were intended for Mark since it seems he used to be outdoorsy (his outie can set up a tent in under three minutes and knows a beautiful rock from a plain one). 

 - **Music** - I suspect the music in the Wellness Center was intended for Irv (his outie is fond of music, owns many records, likes films, owns a machine that can play them, etc.). I’ve included a video with music overlaid that it reminded me of, and I’m curious if anyone else recognizes it. 

## TOUCH

 - **Alexa** - I know this theory might not sit well with everyone, but I believe Alexa was the Waffle Party dancer in the bride mask. I think Harmony hoped her presence might trigger Mark’s memory. However, Mark ultimately gave the Waffle Party to Dylan, despite Harmony encouraging him to take it himself. And of course, Natalie fired Harmony before she had a chance to tell Alexa about the change of plans — but fortunately, Dylan left before anything happened.

**ICYMI:** In S1E6, Alexa is the one who recommended Selvig as a lactation consultant …

**M** = Mark **A** = Alexa\
22:42

 > **M:** Have you seen the princess?\
**A:** No, not since her birth. But I did talk on the phone with your sister. I don’t know how much she tells you about her …\
**M:** Latching difficulties?\
**A:** Yes.\
**M:** I-I’m aware. Maybe too aware. I don’t know.\
**A:** Well, she just wanted the names of some lactation consultants.

**R** = Ricken **D** = Devon **S** = Selvig\
25:43

 > **R:** She’s here.\
**D:** Yeah.\
**R:** Careful. Watch your step. Right this way.\
**S:** Love it.\
**D:** Okay. My girl. There’s my girl. Okay.\
**S:** You must be Devon.\
**R:** Devon, this is Mrs. Selvig.\
**D:** Hi. Yeah, and you’re Mark’s neighbor. Thanks so much for meeting with us.\
**S:** Oh, it’s a privilege. I went giddy when Mark mentioned you were looking for someone.\
**R:** So *serendipitous*.\
**S:** I know.\
**R:** The kelp worked, huh?

**NOTE:** It’s highly unlikely that Devon would hire *her brother’s neighbor* to be her lactation consultant *over* someone her midwife recommends *unless they happen to be the same person* — which, of course, would be *serendipitous*.

### So what’s her end game?

Is Harmony trying to find someone trapped inside Lumon? Her mom? Or perhaps Mr. Selvig?

Is that why she had Petey draw the map? (Petey’s map [includes several direct references to Harmony’s shrine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/s/AWPihfEY50), which means he must have been in her basement to see it.)

Could this be why she’s trying to trigger Irv’s memory? (Perhaps Irv knows the location she’s looking for — hence the elevator painting. Plus, in one of the previews for S2, we saw Harmony holding a lantern and exploring, what appeared to be, the depths of Lumon).

Is that why she showed Mark the blueprints and made him cookies infused with mugwort? (She claimed the cookies were made with chamomile, but judging from the look on Mark’s face, I think she probably used mugwort). As she’s leaving she says, “Well come by the shop, okay? I’ll give you a *mugwort* bath bomb that’ll make you sleep like a rag doll.”

**FYI:** Mugwort is an herb known for its ability to cause lucid dreams. It can be used in various forms, including tea, food, incense, essential oil, or adding it to a steam pot for aromatherapy — which I’m guessing is what’s in the steam pot we see during Irv’s wellness session, which you can see right after Ms. Casey turns up the sound.

You make me write,UnsentLetters,1i9x2f8,2025-01-25 16:06:58,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i9x2f8/you_make_me_write/,Visible-Pipe-9281,Crushes,"I have never been much of a writer. I could never keep a diary, at least not consistently. I would write a few entries in the beginning, and then completely forget about it. I was never very good at writing down what I was feeling, especially if it felt like an obligation, instead of a way to vent. I wouldn’t say I’m good with words, but I don’t think I’m terrible either. I do love to talk, and I do talk a lot. But you make me want to write. You make me want to write about how you make me feel. All these feelings that overflow out of me and fill pages upon pages. Some are newer and less familiar, and so I try to explain them to my blank pages, to see if I can make better sense of them. It helps. I sit down and I let the words appear on the pages of my notebook. I write paragraphs about you, sentences about me and questions about us.

The first time you made me write, I wrote about how I always feel as if I’m on the side lines, watching you be with someone else, watching you being happy with her while I was crumbing inside. It was an unusual feeling. I was proud of what I wrote, but at the same time sad that I was feeling like that. That first time I told my friends how you made me write. They wanted to read it, and another weird thing happened. I wanted to show them, I was so proud of how well it was written, but it also meant bearing a part of my soul, perhaps too big of a part, but I let them read it. The reaction was not what I expected. They were crying, as if the words on the paper reflected their feelings instead of my own. It was comforting to know that they could relate, or that I wrote in such a way, my feeling shone through the paper.

The second time you made me write, I wrote about how I felt like I was too much, how I constantly feel as if I bother you, because I talk too much. This one came from quite a deeper place. A place of self-doubt, and self-awareness. One that holds me in its claws and anchors me to those thoughts. Again, I felt so proud by the end of my writing that I told my friends about it. Not as many though. I shared it only with a few people, but the reactions were the same. Tears and hugs, as if I was consoling them, when I was the one who bared their soul. Still, it felt nice that they liked it.

Recently you have made me write a lot, even this one. I have written about how much I remember you, how having to leave you in another country destroyed me, but mostly you make me write about all the things I wish I could say to you, but don’t have the chance to.

I know these things will never get to you, these letters and pages that I write will never be read by your eyes. So, I started writing them here. Maybe in hopes that I could get some clarity on what to do with all these feelings I write about. Maybe in hopes that you could see them, somehow recognize that they are meant for your eyes, and that they are coming from me. But who am I kidding? You will not see these letters, you will not recognize they are for you, and you will not know they are from me.

Maybe I should keep these private, maybe keep them for your eyes only, but what good would that serve me? You would still not see them. I am too much of a coward to send them to you. Maybe one day, after a few drinks, I will have some liquid courage, and I’ll send one over. Maybe you’ll read them then and learn all about my secret, the one I’ve carried for a few years now. And maybe you’ll do something about it. The unpredictability scares me too much, though. So, I keep these pages hidden from you, yet very public, behind the mask of anonymity, to keep my heart safe.

Maybe one day you won’t make me write anymore, or maybe one day I will write just for you. But for now, I’ll use all the words I need, to write as much as you make me."

I can't keep up with work or daily life without a cocktail of ADHD and anxiety meds, and I still need to hire help to maintain a clean apartment. I don't have close, in-person friends because social interactions often leave me stressed or overstimulated.

Despite this, I feel so deeply lonely. I have a lot of love to give and dream of having a partner, but being a lesbian makes the dating pool smaller, and my low self-esteem has led me to stay in unhealthy relationships in the past. I associate dating with being negged, used, and having my struggles with executive dysfunction dismissed as laziness. When I meet someone amazing, my first thought is often, ""They deserve someone easier.""

Honestly, I’m not sure I even want a relationship right now. I probably need more time to focus on myself, my space, and my healing. I’ve recently started therapy and am coming to terms with being both autistic and ADHD. Radical self-acceptance is something I’m trying to practice, and I hope it’ll help me get to a better place—like hiring a cleaning service without shame and finally buying proper furniture!

I’d also love to find a remote job that pays well enough to replace my current one. Cutting out the commute and masking would free up so much energy for life tasks.

Dating feels overwhelming. When it doesn’t work out, I get extremely depressed for weeks. I’m working on this in therapy, but I still wonder if I’ll ever be ready for a ""traditional"" partnership. Maybe I’ll need to consider less conventional setups, like living apart or even polyamory—though sharing someone romantically doesn’t feel ideal for me.

I know no one owes me anything, but I do hope I can make things work with someone someday. I think I’m cute, and looks aren’t usually an issue. Even when I wasn’t in the best shape, I could still get dates with beautiful women. But nothing ever seemed to last. With dates I've been on in the last year, if and when I do feel chemistry, either I get scared and push the person away or I am rejected. After the last rejection, I went back to not dating. I am reflecting a lot on how to be a healthier partner and my part of the equation all my past romantic dynamics. In my relationships that have lasted, it's usually been because I've overlooked massive red flags. I don't want to do that anymore, either. In some ways, I think my executive dysfunction actually does make me kind of self-absorbed or even a jerk sometimes, but I'm in therapy, on medication, and working on strategies to cope better with executive dysfunction and moments of emotional dysregulation.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. I’m curious: How do you navigate relationships or build close friendships while dealing with neurodivergence? Any tips or stories would be appreciated."

But the following text just doesnt sound good. Do you have any idea or tips? (btw english is not my first lanuage so please excuse the gramatic).

Theater
I started to believe life is just a theater, where everyone is the viewer, that sits in the audience and looks at you and the reality you live in. But at the exact same time these are also actors that play their own roles by their own script that was written on knowledge, education history, society and religion and experience in in their own reality.

This script is a reaction on all actions. Just like the butterfly effect. So each action brings at the same time a reaction. Even if it feels insignificant. There will come a reaction.

Each actor thinks that they have the main role. The one everyone’s looking at. That everyone’s admires or despises. But that’s a falsehood,an illusion.The script is written and it doesn’t havea main character. Because each actor is also the viewer. So why should a viewer in an audience get the main role.Why should a person sitting and watching between many have the right and power to be better.Only the once that understandthis concept can achieve the true serenity of the spectator.

Every character has a script but they don’t read it.Because they cant. They could search all there life looking for it but in the end it would bring them nothing except of two things.

Frustration inthemselves and everybody surrounding them, because they are the reason that they fell down the spiral of suffering.They are the ones which lost themselves in a storm they cant control.This thoughtsslowlybuildup. Intensifyin the mind of the Fool's Errander, until they end up in the eye of the storm.

Its a mix of hate that builds up with in and guids there emotions.

Egoism which try’s to calm them down by telling themselves lies, to forget the own concept of morality just not to be wrong. Arrogance against the ones that once were the peers your family following their side and the one which tried to safe the last bit of your slowly rotting soul. And the slowly creeping feeling that you wasted so much time for NOTHING.

Or they willdiscover the world outside the storm. Theglow. Perhaps not in glory, but in a kind of knowledge that no one else can teach you.In calmness.

And stillether waytheywillact perfectly and accurate identical to the script. It is written for each individual actor. Even if they tried to, even if they gave everything up and became the thing that they fear, it would still be written down.

On the same stage jokes, humor and fun are only real if the actor or the clown is in front of the audience. Because no actor or clown, at least not the majority would laugh as hard over their, or the jokes of others, when their are not in front of an audience. Because that’s the reasons jokes exist. To find a way to amuse other by making them happy. And all this just that they like your performance. It’s a play that’s only based on egoism and nothing more or less.

Society give each actor a mask, a costume they need to wear. It’s there own choice to wear it, to change it, to add Color or to sew it tighter. But to have the will and the courrage to do so. To realize the vision of the truest self of the costume. There is sometimes needed more than just courage. Perhabs other will change it so much that its to model themself into a picture the audience want. At the end all of these will turn into clowns. Some are for the audience and others for themself. But there is one thing that unites allf of them and it is that this type of clowns don’t tell jokes."

Achi from Sin & Punishment. She groomed Saki Amamiya to be a super-soldier after she healed him with some of her power (+ getting him and Airan Jo to join her ""Savior Group""), leading him to turn into a Ruffian (Kaiju) when she floods Tokyo with blood, and helps destroys Tokyo in his fight with Kachua. He then goes into a comatose state. Achi then tells Airan to shoot Saki in this form, and sends her into a dream state with her future son when she refuses. After Airan shoots Saki, Achi sends her into his Kaiju body to make Saki human again.

Once that is done, she goes mask off by sending them to a beach as to keep them away from her. But they both get up, so Achi kidnaps Airan. After Saki gets past her goons, she just starts hurling meteors to the Earth (which Saki has to destroy in Ruffian form), yet that fails so she disappears.

After all of that trauma, Saki still occasionally turns into a Ruffian, which his son (Isa Amamiya) sees, terrifies him, and changes his last name to his mothers maiden name after she tries to comfort him (so now he is Isa Jo). Saki and Airan are presumed dead in Star Successor, and Isa is now in the military of Earth 4. After an outsider that the gods of the universe want dead enters into Earth 4 (and threatens to destroy the Earth), Isa is sent to kill it.

>!Her name is Achi, and she lost her memory. Isa feels bad, so he protects her against his old friends, discovers and uses his ruffian form, and uses that to end his old friend Deko and save Achi. After they both touch down to Earth, Achi reveals to Isa she has regained her memory, including her name. When Isa asks for her name out of curiosity, she states her name is Kachi. With her enemies defeated and the twist revealed, the game ends there.!<

Kachi is essentially a master manipulator, that destroyed countless lives on Earth (and perhaps on many Earths) just to get her way for petty power."

Webbers Falls Public Schools moves to distance learning because of mass illness,oklahoma,1i9wv15,2025-01-25 15:58:01,13,1.0,2,https://www.fox23.com/news/webbers-falls-public-schools-moves-to-distance-learning-because-of-mass-illness/article_ea964702-d93d-11ef-a6ec-0f352a22f8c0.html,MaebyFunke42,News,"WEBBERS FALLS, Okla. — Webbers Falls Public Schools has moved to distance learning for Thursday and Friday due to the number of students and teachers out sick with the flu and strep throat.

On Wednesday, the district posted to Facebook that 107 students and 9 staff members were out sick. This makes up almost half their student body.

To help stop the spread of illness, the district chose to go virtual for the next two days.

Ali Sanders is the elementary school principal. She said having this many students out is a big deal for them and staff is being affected too. At last check nine staff members were out sick.

“We’re a small school we might have a staff member that’s out they may teach a class and drive a bus route so it hits us in multiple areas if we have somebody that goes out,” Sanders said.

This isn’t just affecting Webbers Falls as Porum public schools posted on Facebook saying they will be distance learning until Monday due to sickness.

Walgreens has Oklahoma listed in the top ten states with flu activity.

Sanders wants to make it clear that distance learning does not mean it’s a couple days off school. Students are expected to still check in to class and complete assignments.

All staff who are not sick will be disinfecting the building and their classrooms while also helping students with their virtual learning from 8:30 a.m. until 3:00 p.m.

“We’re wiping everything down desk chairs pencil sharpeners were gonna give it a deep clean,” said Sanders.

---FYI, disinfecting is helpful in containing infectious disease, but both flu and strep are spread by droplets in the air AND contaminated surfaces. The best way to reduce spread while ill is to stay home (if able) and mask (if willing). The best way to keep yourself well is to keep your hands away from your face and stop breathing in other people's infectious breath droplets through masking.

"""The Elephant Man"" (1980): 8 Oscar Nominations. 0 Oscar wins.",oscarrace,1i9wpix,2025-01-25 15:51:20,8,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1i9wpix/the_elephant_man_1980_8_oscar_nominations_0_oscar/,Laurie_Barrynox,Discussion,"It's such a gem and quite unconventional for David Lynch whose movies tended to verge into the surreal and bizarre and this movie was as close to a studio film as I've ever seen from Lynch. 

Filmed in B&W, produced by Mel Brooks, The Elephant Man is about John Merrick, a man who was extremely disfigured and treated like a circus freak but when he's taken in by Frederick Treves, a surgeon, it's quickly discovered he's a intelligent and sensitive man who is able to finally find some kind of happiness through the Medical College he's placed in. 

John Hurt is just uncanny in the part. He brought so much emotion and tenderness through the mask and prosthetics, I don't know how he managed to pull that off.

The Elephant Man was a movie I watched many years ago and I never forgot about it. I was so invested in John Merrick and I wanted him to have a happy ending. When he gets kidnapped by his old boss and experiences some shattering indignities, the moment John screams ""I am a human being! I am a man!"", it's hard not to feel a lump on your throat. 

This is probably my 2nd favorite David Lynch movie after Fire Walk With Me."

DM and BF should be in jail,BryanKohbergerMoscow,1i9wldc,2025-01-25 15:46:23,4,0.6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BryanKohbergerMoscow/comments/1i9wldc/dm_and_bf_should_be_in_jail/,thisDiff,,"The most shocking detail from the hearing was Ashley Jennings’ statement that the perpetrator DM saw was wearing a ninja mask, and this confirmed detail raises serious questions about DM’s response. 

If someone encounters a figure in black wearing a ninja mask, it’s implausible they’d simply shut the door, text someone, and go to sleep. For eight hours. Then call friends over to call 911. 

The timeline also raises concerns. If the crime began at 4:17 AM and lasted 25 minutes, the length that Murphy was barking for, how does DM’s inaction make sense? The noise level during that 25 minutes would have been enough to rouse suspicion and a 911 call.

The Judge Hipler let the cat out of the bag at the trial too when Anne Taylor was discussing the DNA.

Then judge alluded to BF’s claim that she witnessed a man changing clothes, bagging them, and leaving. The naked man running rumours that are now all but certain.

She witnessed this, made a statement to police about it (which was discussed at the close portion of the hearing) but she too did not call 911. 

Her behavior—texting but not seeking immediate help—doesn’t align with common reactions to such an event. 

Then there’s the stools jammed in the frame of the back sliding door, almost like someone inside tried to lock it after they saw the perpetrators leave. If that’s the case, how did they not see their dead roomies through their open doors? The doors being open is another thing we also found out at this hearing. 

The judge must have grappled with these contradictions during the hearing. The facts demand closer scrutiny, as the presented narrative continues to defy logic. Their omission from the PCA is reckless. 

I sincerely hope that there’s an acquittal soon.  "

Snake wolf 3 (my new megadungeon) is finally up for sale!,osr,1i9wjxr,2025-01-25 15:44:40,2,0.75,2,https://legacy.drivethrurpg.com/product/463933/Terror-of-the-Stratosfiend--Cycle-of-the-SnakeWolf-3--The-Scales-of-HyperVisor-God-or-The-Final-Voyage-of-the-Crab-King-MEGADUNGEON,HypatiasAngst,,"A paranoid, conspiracy laden, 296-page adventure for Levels 1-6+ for Dungeon Crawl Classics. A Town with Problems, a trek through the Woods, a crawl across The Capitol, and an endless dive into a Mega-Dungeon—chasing a man who dared to touch a God. All tied together with a [Conspiracy Die] that shrinks and grows as the world becomes more and less rational; unable to explain itself. 

It all started in the Shattered Woods—an agent, a family man, the Crab-King, was sent to visit a god. He touched He, setting off a chain reaction of events, the foretold death of a god, and his own mutagenesis.  

Enter Mercy of Angels, the haven in the Shattered Woods that housed the dying god and the government man gone mad. Here is the base of operations, where this adventure could start—but doesn’t need to. 

Everyone wants to find the Crab-King and just bring him home. To his family? To Washington? Rumours say he needs to be brought back to Washington, so maybe there?

Maybe you find him? Maybe you just wandered over the Covered Bridge, but you make it to Washington, a place much more paranoid than you think it would be. You can’t trust anyone, but the food is good, and the drinks are even better. Supposedly the Salons (House Parties) are good too. 

Also, the Witch-Phase have emerged from the earth… I should have mentioned that earlier on the page. They’re elves with shark lineage from the pits of the earth. 

Dodge the People-in-Black, or don’t—they’ll just send Black Helicopters to bring you back. 

Don’t say alien.

And, most importantly, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVER ENTER THE FACILITY. THERE IS NOTHING THERE AND IT IS DEFINITELY NOT JUST AN OFFICE BUILDING ON TOP OF A BLACK SITE ON TOP OF AN ALIEN CRASH SITE ON TOP OF A SET OF INTERDIMENSIONAL PORTALS. 

It is in fact a mega-dungeon. 

Mercy of Angels, the starting town that once housed a god. 
- The Shattered Woods, a point crawl investigating what’s really going on in the woods.   
- Washington, a city crawl searching for “the facility”: A mega-dungeon with 360 rooms, spanning 12 levels, with 13 factions vying for power, 6 layers of history, and at least 2 dragons. 
- 270+ encounters — a lot of things are wandering about, eating people, firing lasers, the usual. 
- 210+ NPCS — from healers, card game players, town mayors, bounty hunters, to a walking brain. 
- 100+ Bestiary Entries — people-in-black, black helicopters, black cars, mutant shock troopers, holographic alien ghosts... the usual 
- 90+ new pieces of gear — from Trinidadian food to shock rifles to all matter of reverse engineered alien technology. 
- 40+ Vehicles — tanks, catamarans, hang gliders. 
- 24 Mercenaries — including a strange man in a mask and a were-jackalope. 
- 30 adventure hooks — there’s UFOs in Washington you know. 
- 30 occupations and new character Desires to go with them. — you can be a noise musician! 
- 1 new playable species. 
- not including the Metal-Faced Giantess, the Giant Robot, or the SpellOS Drives scattered all about; as well as procedures for Oracle Cards,Trading Cards, and Collectible Card Games.  "

Advice regarding greasy hair shampoos,Hair,1i9wfyt,2025-01-25 15:39:45,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/1i9wfyt/advice_regarding_greasy_hair_shampoos/,TigercatX,Help,"Hello everyone,

Since my hair tends to get greasy and I have to wash it about every three days (also because it takes on a horrible look) I used to try out different shampoos with no results at all. Now I was trying to use [this shampoo](https://www.amazon.it/Fisiologico-Sebonormalizzante-Olio-Shampoo-Schiumogeni-Aggressivi/dp/B00S18VH8M/ref=asc_df_B00S18VH8M?mcid=93bf253e37e83ab7ab61db0e202991d9&tag=googshopit-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=700814882380&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15827843117907409623&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9208866&hvtargid=pla-466817913576&gad_source=1&th=1&language=en_GB).

Actually, if I use it, my scalp is cleaner, but the hair tends not to be soft or vibrant like with common shampoos. Especially after drying them, they seem to be ""sticky"" when touching them.

It's not the first time I've tried specific shampoos and had this problem, which is why I've often stopped using them. This doesn't happen if I use regular shampoos. If I use the shampoo from the supermarket, my hair is perfect, but then I have the problem that they become oily quickly.



I don't know if it can be useful to find out a solution, but here's how I wash my hair:

I wet hair, then I add shampoo and wait a minute (as the instructions say) before washing it away  (I do this procedure two times).

Then I use a hair conditioner (last time I used a hair mask).

In the end, after drying the excess water with a towel, I stand upside down to dry them, then I stand upright to comb them and continue drying them.



I hope someone can help me and give me some suggestions. Thank you. :)"

AITA for not joining her?,AITA_Relationships,1i9we7k,2025-01-25 15:37:32,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1i9we7k/aita_for_not_joining_her/,iAmKilSmil,,"About a Week ago my girlfriend invited me to dinner on Saturday with some of her family members. I told her I would think about it. There was also a babtism she wanted to go to Today as well, where I would have been invited too, where again, once she asked me about a Week ago, I told her I would think about it. But Today morning I finally decided against it. This type of ordeal happens regularly.


We've been together for about half a year now, and I haven't met her family, except her brother. When we spend time together, it's usually just us two. She told me she was upset Today because she'd rather experience those events with me instead of her going on her own.


The reason I keep postponing these decisions and usually don't end up going, is because sometimes meetings with lots of people I don't know in loud and crowded places are almost unbearable for me. I don't want to immediately decline any requests though because I am dreadfully scared of confrontation and I also genuinely don't usually know yet if I definitely won't go. I would have to think about what kind of environment it would be, what kind of people, my mental state on that day etc. before I can decide such a thing.


I don't know if I am just self pitying myself. I think I might have autism, I will get tested for that in a few months, and I am diagnosed with social anxiety, but I don't know if that's really an excuse to not partake in her life that much. Her family and friends are very important to her and I don't think she knew from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to be a part of that, because I was masking quite a bit back then.


TL;DR
I don't go to social events with my girlfriend and she's upset about it."
Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,selfhelp,1i9we0j,2025-01-25 15:37:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1i9we0j/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,EERMA,,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.


So, ask yourself: What is one thing from this article that resonates most with you? What small action can you take today to start navigating your life in a healthier way?
And what are your own go to strategies?"

I’m not sure how to deal with so much grief.,grief,1i9wc1t,2025-01-25 15:34:51,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/grief/comments/1i9wc1t/im_not_sure_how_to_deal_with_so_much_grief/,ThrowRA-pickle4,,"Just to preface before, this is mostly about pets. I haven’t experienced any deaths of close family members (thank god), only great grand parents and a step grandfather. I also just want to say this post will most likely be very long. I think I may just need to rant, but I am also looking for advice. 

When I was 10/11 years old, my first ever pet passed traumatically. He was a hamster; 2.5 years old. When he died, he was gasping in my hands for hours. I remember being so upset (obviously) and tried everything in the moment I could think of to save him. I even put him on a heating blanket, but to no avail. That was already very traumatic for me and I swore I wouldn’t get another hamster. 

In 2023 I had three ferrets, two males and one female. I got the female first, around 2021, and I loved her soooooo much. I wanted ferrets since I was a child and she was my very first one. She was so sassy, small, and a sable (dark brown with a white mask) while the males are white and much larger. In December 2023 I noticed her tail was getting bald so I took her to the vet. She said it was most likely seasonal, but to come back if it doesn’t grow back in 2 or 3 months. Long story short, she was diagnosed cancer in May 2024, her birth month. We were doing treatments and got 3 months of life. In those 3 months, she became soooooo skinny. I could see her ribcage, she was eating less, had very thin hair, and had no energy to play with her brothers. In the last month of her life, she lost the ability to use her back legs. She eventually starting using the bathroom on her self due to her being unable to bring herself to the potty pads. She couldn’t get up to eat so I spoon fed her in bed. Her legs turned purple and I had to witness her last days. It made me feel so useless and depressed, I didn’t feel comfortable putting her down because she would still eat and drink if I brought it to her and in my eyes still looked like she had the want to live, like she hadn’t given up so I couldn’t either. Even in her last seconds of life she had that same look, she even ate a treat an hour before she died.

Currently, I have a hamster that I have had for 3 years. He was surrendered and was fully grown, so I don’t know his true age but it’s old (lol). He currently is in his last phase of life, and once again I can do nothing except watch him pass. His skin is extremely flaky, and maybe flaky isn’t even the right word. It looks similar to when a lizard gets stuck is its shed, like an entire layer of white dead skin sitting on top. He has a massive tumor on the side of his face that throws off his balance. Over the last 2 days he has not been interested in his regular food but still drink and will eat fruit. He moves extremely slow and has noticeably been getting up less. This has brought up a lot of emotions about watching so many animals die slowly. I feel extremely guilty, useless, like I need to be doing more to help. Im not sure how to end all of this off, I really just needed to share. I feel as though the universe keeps torturing me, making me watch all of these slow deaths to “teach me something”. I’m not sure how make sense of everything that has happened. "

I went to a salon I have used for over a year and asked for an extreme bleaching, platinum hair. I typically get partial or full highlights, my natural hair is a mousy brown but I’ve been very blonde for years and never had any issues. I use the same stylist and he didn’t say anything concerning when I made my out of the ordinary request. I realize that with a more extreme bleaching damage comes with it but my hair has thinned out A LOT in the week since I had that service- even with gentle care and moisturizing routine which I cranked up to manage the excess damage. Not only did he damage the hell out of my hair he put a root shadow on that left a distinct skunk line on my natural part. I had to move the part to hide the lines. It looks awful, my hair is very damaged and I’m extremely upset over this. He could have told me he wasn’t comfortable with this request instead of damaging my hair this much. I paid a lot of money to have my hair come out a certain way and certain quality but here I am very disappointed. What I can I do heal my hair? I have the bonding treatments, proteins, leave ins and deep moisturizing masks, I brush it only when it is dry and handle it with the utmost care. Please I’ll take any advice. Should I request he fix it? Should I ask for a keratin treatment? What do I do? "

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (次男)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

“All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.”

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble (ギャンブル, Gyanburu) Fortune (財産, Zaisan) Luck (運, Un) Wish (願い, Negai) Value (価値, Kachi) Increase (増加, Zōka) Probability (確率, Kakuritsu) Jackpot (ジャックポット, Jakkupōtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakutō. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakutō like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Zōka (賭け金の増加, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head. The first card that is created is the Number Ace card, representing duality and balance, As i can absorb energy from every sources, whether it be spiritual energy, reishi particles, or even the force of attacks directed towards me. Each attack absorbed contributes to the creation of a new card. However, to create each subsequent card, I must first either absorb energy which is equal to double the amount of attacks as compared to the previous card, Or i Charge my own Zanpakuto With my own power, Which allows me to cut the full charging time in half. For example, to create the first card the Ace, I must first absorb the amount of energy equal to that of two attacks. To create the second card, I must absorb energy which is equal to the amount of four attacks, and so on. This pattern continues, with each new card requiring double the amount of energy as compared to the previous card.
With the cards allowing me a multitude of abilities, such as the ability to use different card games to my advantage, the ability to Is seal away outside attacks, and even ""cut through"" other attacks. 
Now as more cards are created and exist on the battlefield, My own strength, speed, healing, and defense are enhanced. The presence of the cards acts as a catalyst, amplifying My physical attributes and granting them heightened capabilities, As I am able to draw on them like a battery. This boost is proportional to the number of cards in play.
Additionally, i gain control over the four elements - Water, Earth, Eind, and Fire, By using the power of my Zanpakuto (energy conversion) i can Convert the original energy into elemental energy. With them I can summon and manipulate these elemental forces to launch long-range attacks, create defensive barriers, or further augment My own abilities. The elemental control further adds further to my versatility in battle, allowing for strategic offensive and defensive maneuvers.
It also has one final passive ability which can be initiated at any time and it is called Gisei Dekki (犠牲 デッキ, Sacrificial Deck) it is an ability that when activated absorbs all of the cards belonging to whichever suit chosen and element they are affiliated with, this then transforms the Zanpakuto from its normal State of spiritual energy conversion, into a state which embodies said element.


Supēdo (スペード, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.  


Shinzō (心臓, Heart): Now the hearts cards If have the unique ability to heal My physical body, and are powerful as The Hearts card can create overly powerful water-based attacks and healing waves that wash over allies, cleansing and revitalizing them. strength and healing. 
When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to Generate a Large flood that churns and spins itself into a Whirlpool which Breaks apart everything in its domain, As it spins, All of the debris caught within turns it muddy and murky , but it continues to spin anyways as everything that collapses into It turns it poisonous and acidic to anything spiritual in nature the healing waters now turned deadly as it in dragged into the depths of the ""oceans floor"".
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu (クラブ部, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo (ダイヤモンド, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to shatter and create mountains, control fault lines and the very crust and tectonic plates, cause earthquakes and can then use the broken rock to form and create asteroids, and More. 
Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


Jōkā (ジョーカー, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


—————————(Techniques)—————————


Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te (エレメンタル ルーレット: 運命の手, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called Kādo Genshō Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


—————————(weaknesses)—————————

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

My mom just gave me permission to buy noise canceling headphones and I told her I would do some research to find the best ones. We both agree that it would help me tremendously.

For some context, I’ve always been good at masking and it’s taking some time for my mom to adjust to the things I need now, such as noise canceling headphones. But she’s trying really hard to understand. 

Therefore, I’m wondering if anyone has some good noise canceling headphones to recommend, preferably bluetooth. I also wear glasses if that means anything.

I wanted to start by asking people directly before Googling. 

Thanks everyone!

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (次男)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

“All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.”

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble (ギャンブル, Gyanburu) Fortune (財産, Zaisan) Luck (運, Un) Wish (願い, Negai) Value (価値, Kachi) Increase (増加, Zōka) Probability (確率, Kakuritsu) Jackpot (ジャックポット, Jakkupōtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakutō. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakutō like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Zōka (賭け金の増加, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head. The first card that is created is the Number Ace card, representing duality and balance, As i can absorb energy from every sources, whether it be spiritual energy, reishi particles, or even the force of attacks directed towards me. Each attack absorbed contributes to the creation of a new card. However, to create each subsequent card, I must first either absorb energy which is equal to double the amount of attacks as compared to the previous card, Or i Charge my own Zanpakuto With my own power, Which allows me to cut the full charging time in half. For example, to create the first card the Ace, I must first absorb the amount of energy equal to that of two attacks. To create the second card, I must absorb energy which is equal to the amount of four attacks, and so on. This pattern continues, with each new card requiring double the amount of energy as compared to the previous card.
With the cards allowing me a multitude of abilities, such as the ability to use different card games to my advantage, the ability to Is seal away outside attacks, and even ""cut through"" other attacks. 
Now as more cards are created and exist on the battlefield, My own strength, speed, healing, and defense are enhanced. The presence of the cards acts as a catalyst, amplifying My physical attributes and granting them heightened capabilities, As I am able to draw on them like a battery. This boost is proportional to the number of cards in play.
Additionally, i gain control over the four elements - Water, Earth, Eind, and Fire, By using the power of my Zanpakuto (energy conversion) i can Convert the original energy into elemental energy. With them I can summon and manipulate these elemental forces to launch long-range attacks, create defensive barriers, or further augment My own abilities. The elemental control further adds further to my versatility in battle, allowing for strategic offensive and defensive maneuvers.
It also has one final passive ability which can be initiated at any time and it is called Gisei Dekki (犠牲 デッキ, Sacrificial Deck) it is an ability that when activated absorbs all of the cards belonging to whichever suit chosen and element they are affiliated with, this then transforms the Zanpakuto from its normal State of spiritual energy conversion, into a state which embodies said element.


Supēdo (スペード, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.  


Shinzō (心臓, Heart): Now the hearts cards If have the unique ability to heal My physical body, and are powerful as The Hearts card can create overly powerful water-based attacks and healing waves that wash over allies, cleansing and revitalizing them. strength and healing. 
When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to Generate a Large flood that churns and spins itself into a Whirlpool which Breaks apart everything in its domain, As it spins, All of the debris caught within turns it muddy and murky , but it continues to spin anyways as everything that collapses into It turns it poisonous and acidic to anything spiritual in nature the healing waters now turned deadly as it in dragged into the depths of the ""oceans floor"".
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu (クラブ部, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo (ダイヤモンド, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to shatter and create mountains, control fault lines and the very crust and tectonic plates, cause earthquakes and can then use the broken rock to form and create asteroids, and More. 
Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


Jōkā (ジョーカー, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


—————————(Techniques)—————————


Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te (エレメンタル ルーレット: 運命の手, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called Kādo Genshō Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


—————————(weaknesses)—————————

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

Lord of Nothing difficulty question,Pathfinder_Kingmaker,1i9w1n7,2025-01-25 15:21:51,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/1i9w1n7/lord_of_nothing_difficulty_question/,Warezhki,Righteous : Game,"So, after 12 hours I've finally finished Through the Ashes DLC on Core(doing ""The Unbreakable Trio"" achievement on my first run definitely was a questionable choice) and ported the save to the Lord of Nothing. I've heard that this DLC is easier than TtA and is more focused on epic adventure, like the main campaign, but from my first experience this is far from truth. First battle with masked stalker was already difficult enough, after a few reloads and three characters downed and last one barely alive I've managed to get him with good grease rng. And after that the game just expects you to beat those zombies in the cave? Besides the fact that you're outnumbered and can't rest before the fight, if you manage to survive long enough their spellcaster will just shut all your characters down with stinking cloud. And if you decide to focus him first, barbarians will eventually make their web saves and put you into the ground fast. I only managed to beat this encounter by triggering the cutscene with my dog, running all the way to the entrance, disengaging and sending Rekarth in to perform a good old hit-and-run tactic(RTwP on, shoot an enemy from afar, run away and disengage from the fight, repeat until everyone is dead). I tolerated this in TtA because it made sense there and most of the encounters weren't like this, but considering the fact that this campaign is designed closer to the main one, something tells me that more of this bullshit is to come. Will it get easier later on or will I have to turn down the difficulty?

(Mostly for your eyes) - Any lux skincare packaging design you love?,SkincareAddictionLux,1i9vzsa,2025-01-25 15:19:36,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/1i9vzsa/mostly_for_your_eyes_any_lux_skincare_packaging/,CommandOk6118,Let's Chat,"Want to start a fun thread appreciating beautiful designs, so I'm leaving function and effectiveness aside for this post :) although I'd love to hear your thoughts for function and effectiveness if you can share! 

I'll start. The most beautiful design I found all time is Shiseido Eudermine 200 ml bottle the previous version. It's been discontinued maybe a year or two ago. the 125 ml bottle looks similar but the bottleneck is too thin for my liking and not looking balanced. 

As for the product itself, it's not a magic juice but does well for basic hydration. The scent is light and elegant. To match the sumptuous red hue, even the wrapper for the outer box is red tinted. 

[this is the 200 ml bottle](https://preview.redd.it/adx7kcjh37fe1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=310764cfc2509b7a0fd5ac16e1566a3be6c17400)

  
guerlain abeille royale collection - Hexagon and honey/sunflower yellow colored bottles and jars throughout. matches well with the 'bee essence' concept that the brand is advertising. I have the double R serum, eye serum, lotion and night cream sitting on my vanity to be finished this winter. as for the effect itself, I don't see much for the price and I don't think I'll repurchase. but the design is very cohesive in this collection and look luxurious and comforting

Dior prestige - this is another example which I prefer the previous version. The new version with a stra on the lid is overdoing imo. unfortunately the cream breaks me out bad, but the exfoliator mask is divine, and $125 for 5oz with a heavy, expensive looking jar isn't so bad. 

[exfoliator is bottom left. Comes with a spatula not filmsy or plastic \(la mer, I'm looking at you lol\). I use this spatula to scoop my body creme](https://preview.redd.it/9v9b59et57fe1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=50f5f557612cef6ffdf7725626466205d9015c45)

  
Clé de Peau -  La Creme limited editions. I don't own any of them though. Most of the limited edition jars are 1 oz so not long lasting, and I would thinking so hard on how to repurpose them. I used to pair this cream + the serum, and works perfect for my combo skin in winter. it's not too heavy and makes your skin soft and radiant, but idk about the anti-aging, lifting effect they offer since I'm younger. 

[2021 LE is my favourite. Jade\/Emerald + Pink diamond! ](https://preview.redd.it/7nueirjc77fe1.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=586ecf3736ac0c593ce8909619a9ec941bc40d22)

I enjoy the cool feeling of the clay. After 10 or 15 minutes the clay dries and starts to feel a bit uncomfortable so there's a natural time limit. I don't like washing the face mask off in the sink, so I'm happy to hop in the shower to get it off.

Just a little trick I've learned about myself :)"

In both his ferality and his hunger, he is no different from his kin, but what sets him apart is an unusual cyclical behavior. It is little known fact that there are actually two men that bear the name and mask of Strigicks. This is likely due to the fact that, for the most part, only one of the two is ever alive. When Strigicks is resurrected by the powers of Anzenmezzeron, he will seek out his flock, which the other Strigicks will have assumed leadership of. The resurrected Strigicks will then attempt to murder his other. Regardless of which one survives, the victor will take both mask and leadership of the flock, and feed the other Strigick's carcass to the Owls.
