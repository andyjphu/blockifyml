Possible theory?,XRP,1i9wzqa,2025-01-25 16:03:36,1,0.67,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRP/comments/1i9wzqa/possible_theory/,Beautiful-Branch7018,Fluff,"So, over the last while I've noticed the price going up and down by a relatively small amount. Loads of support around the 3- 3.10 area however not much to take and keep us over 3.2 which is strange given the forward momentum and also the increased hype. 

Given that xrp is likely to be included in the US reserve to help clear their national debt. Does it not benefit them significantly to buy at this price and not let it climb? Or is this irrelevant? Example, they will buy it at a reduced rate, or have a portion donated to offset average cost? (surely this would reduce the price of holders bags?). 

Could this be unravelling at a planned pace? Get the stars in the sky before allowing them to aline to maximise profit? 

This would clearly lead to a massive price increase for us, and the US. This would then surely lead to a massive rug pull if they sell to pay off the aforementioned debt. 

Thoughts? 

If this does happen, then surely we are waiting for the US to essentially rug pull, by selling the XRP to pay off said debt? "

I am newer to crypto, and have been buying XRP for about a year now. When I first got into it I was using Webull Pay to buy XRP. After following crypto more I learned that it‚Äôs not the best exchange because I technically don‚Äôt own my coins and I can‚Äôt move them to a cold storage wallet if I wanted to and ultimately that‚Äôs the best option when keeping your assets safe.

So I started buying on Coinbase as well. As of now I have most of my crypto on Webull and some on Coinbase. I want to get it all over to Coinbase eventually so I can move it to a cold storage wallet - but that‚Äôs where my question comes in. 

Is Coinbase exchange like Webull where I don‚Äôt own my coins and can‚Äôt transfer them? From what I understand there‚Äôs a difference between Coinbase wallet and Coinbase Exchange. If I buy a ledger device, am I able to move everything from Coinbase exchange to a cold wallet? Or is Coinbase exchange the same as Webull pay essentially?

Ozak AI Joins DOGE and XRP in Rally as Key Metrics Surge and Trump Presidency Sparks Momentum,draqai,1i9wtus,2025-01-25 15:56:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i9wtus/ozak_ai_joins_doge_and_xrp_in_rally_as_key/,MammothBattle33,,"üîÆ Ozak AI Lights Up the Crypto Scene with $OZ Token Presale Success  

Hey there, crypto cuties! It looks like Ozak AI is turning heads in all the right ways. With its presale campaign smashing expectations, raising a dazzling $350,000 (that‚Äôs 81% of its $1M target), the buzz is getting real. Investors are vibing with the project‚Äôs delicious blend of AI and blockchain tech, making it one of the hottest names to watch RN! 

Currently priced at just $0.002 in its second presale phase, $OZ is teasing a listing price of $0.05. Imagine locking in that potential 5x return, baby! Ozak‚Äôs ecosystem flexes advanced tech with its Ozak Stream Network and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, giving users spicy real-time market data and predictive insights. Talk about making power moves! 

üí• Ripple Effects of Trump-Era Hype  
ICYMI, whispers of pro-crypto vibes from a potential Trump presidency are fueling market ‚Äúoomph.‚Äù Rumors about a national reserve for U.S.-backed tokens like $XRP and $SOL are pushing interest through the roof. If regulatory clarity and innovation-focused policies roll in, Ozak AI could ride that wave straight into crypto royalty.  

üê∂ $DOGE FOMO Turns Eyes Toward Future-Proof Tokens  
Let‚Äôs spill some tea on $DOGE: Sure, our favorite meme king saw a 320% glow-up last year thanks to Musk mania. But whispers of limited utility are shifting attention to serious contenders like Ozak AI. With its snazzy AI-driven solutions and real-time data tools, Ozak is the full-on snack that keeps you coming back.  

üåä $XRP Riding High, Living Its Best Life  
Your fave $XRP just broke records, flirted with $3, and sparked more optimism than a double-shot espresso. Speculation of an XRP-focused ETF and potential regulatory love is setting the scene for bigger moves. Ozak AI‚Äôs timing here might just be perfection, aligning with a market hungry for disruption.  

With the $OZ token‚Äôs long-term potential and a possible future $1 price tag by 2025, could this be the glow-up you‚Äôve been waiting for? Yep, innovation is sexy.

Jasmy is primarily focused on empowering individuals with control over their data, especially in the context of IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It seeks to create a decentralized system where data generated by personal IoT devices (smartphones, wearables, connected cars, etc.) is controlled by the users rather than large corporations.

Current and Future Use Cases:
	‚Ä¢	Decentralized Data Storage: Jasmy aims to give people ownership of the data generated by their IoT devices. This is especially relevant in today‚Äôs digital landscape, where personal data is often controlled by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Jasmy‚Äôs blockchain provides a secure and private way to store and manage that data.
	‚Ä¢	IoT Ecosystem: As IoT devices become more ubiquitous (smart homes, smart cities, connected healthcare, etc.), Jasmy could serve as the underlying platform for data storage and transfer between devices. For example, your wearable fitness tracker or smart home devices could send and store data securely on Jasmy‚Äôs blockchain.
	‚Ä¢	Data Sovereignty: With concerns over privacy and surveillance, data sovereignty (giving users control of their data) is a growing concern. Jasmy is positioned to tap into this by allowing individuals to choose how their data is used, without it being exploited by centralized platforms.
	‚Ä¢	Tokenized Data Economy: Jasmy could help create a tokenized data economy, where users can earn tokens for sharing their data in ways that benefit them, rather than large corporations profiting off it.
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise Applications: Jasmy could eventually be used by companies to securely store and manage vast amounts of IoT data for applications in sectors like logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and smart cities.

Technological Development:
	‚Ä¢	Partnerships: Jasmy has already partnered with SoftBank, one of Japan‚Äôs leading tech firms, which could help accelerate adoption of its IoT solutions. SoftBank‚Äôs involvement in the telecom and tech space could enable broader access to Jasmy‚Äôs technology, particularly in the deployment of 5G networks and connected devices.
	‚Ä¢	Future Integration: As IoT adoption grows and blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Jasmy could see further integration into global IoT networks. This could position Jasmy as a leading platform for secure, decentralized data management in the rapidly expanding IoT sector.

2. XRP (Ripple): Evolution and Use Cases

XRP, created by Ripple Labs, is one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the financial space. It is designed to solve issues related to cross-border payments and financial transactions‚Äîspecifically the inefficiencies and high costs of traditional international remittances.

Current and Future Use Cases:
	‚Ä¢	Cross-Border Payments: XRP‚Äôs primary use case is to facilitate cross-border payments. Traditional international money transfers (via banks or remittance services) are slow, costly, and inefficient. Ripple uses XRP to allow for near-instant and low-cost transactions between banks and financial institutions across borders. RippleNet is already being used by major financial institutions and banks globally, such as Santander, PNC, and Standard Chartered.
	‚Ä¢	Liquidity and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Ripple‚Äôs ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) service uses XRP as a bridge currency to facilitate instant payments between different fiat currencies. For example, an individual or business can send USD to a recipient in Mexico, where XRP is used to convert the USD into Mexican Pesos instantly and at a low cost. This can save banks and financial institutions millions in liquidity costs.
	‚Ä¢	Smart Contracts and Enterprise Solutions: Ripple has also been exploring smart contracts to enhance its payment solutions, potentially enabling programmable money and more efficient, automated financial transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Ripple is working on CBDC projects, collaborating with governments to integrate XRP into central bank digital currencies. This could be a significant long-term use case for XRP, as governments around the world explore creating their own digital currencies.

Technological Development:
	‚Ä¢	RippleNet and Ripple‚Äôs Network: RippleNet, Ripple‚Äôs global network, connects financial institutions and enables fast, low-cost international transfers. Over 300+ financial institutions are already part of the network, and this number is expected to grow as adoption of blockchain-based payment systems increases.
	‚Ä¢	Regulatory Challenges: Ripple has faced regulatory challenges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has raised concerns about whether XRP is a security. However, Ripple has continued to fight the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit, and a favorable resolution for Ripple could unlock even greater growth and adoption.
	‚Ä¢	Expansion into New Markets: As the global financial landscape continues to shift towards digital solutions, Ripple‚Äôs XRP is well-positioned to play a key role in the future of digital payments, especially as traditional banking infrastructure adopts more efficient blockchain solutions.

Potential Synergies Between Jasmy and XRP:

Though Jasmy and XRP serve different primary functions (data management for Jasmy and payments for XRP), there are potential synergies between the two technologies:
	‚Ä¢	Decentralized Payments in IoT: Jasmy‚Äôs IoT devices could use XRP for instant micropayments or for transferring value when interacting with different connected devices. For instance, Jasmy could enable a system where IoT devices like smart cars or smart homes could use XRP for transactional exchanges (e.g., paying for energy, services, or data usage in real-time).
	‚Ä¢	Cross-Border Data and Payment Solutions: If Jasmy gains traction in international markets, XRP could facilitate cross-border payments related to the IoT data economy. For example, data shared via Jasmy‚Äôs platform could have associated value, and XRP could be used to handle transactions across borders with minimal fees.
	‚Ä¢	Blockchain Integration: Both projects use blockchain technology to create decentralized ecosystems, and as both ecosystems mature, there could be future integrations or collaborations to support global decentralized data and payment solutions.

Conclusion:

Both Jasmy and XRP have distinct but potentially complementary roles in the future of blockchain adoption. Jasmy focuses on decentralizing data ownership and empowering individuals in the IoT space, while XRP is revolutionizing cross-border payments and financial transactions.

As blockchain adoption expands in both the IoT and financial sectors, there‚Äôs potential for these two projects to complement each other, particularly as the global digital economy grows and requires efficient solutions for data management and value transfer.

Would you like to explore more specific developments within each project or look into potential future collaborations between such blockchain technologies?"

"Analyst Says This Is Your Last Chance To Sell XRP Above $3, Here‚Äôs Why",Blockviews,1i9n3od,2025-01-25 08:37:53,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i9n3od/analyst_says_this_is_your_last_chance_to_sell_xrp/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Analyst sounds alarm on last-minute $XRP sell-off as correction looms  

$XRP traders, heads up! A TradingView analyst has pinpointed the $3.33 mark as a golden last-minute selling opportunity before a significant market downturn. According to his analysis based on the Elliott Wave Theory, XRP‚Äôs Wave 4 correction could drag the price to as low as $2.50 ‚Äì a steep 20% drop from its current value near $3.12.  

The projections, which forecast the downtrend to likely extend until March 2025, warn investors to prepare for volatility. However, it‚Äôs not all grim. While the expected correction unfolds, the analyst identifies a ""sweet spot"" buy zone between $2.00 and $2.50, hinting at a promising recovery in Wave 5 of the Elliott cycle.  

Beyond the charts, several bullish undercurrents could power $XRP in the long term. From Ripple's potential U.S. relocation to favorable pro-crypto policies on the horizon, the doors to adoption milestones remain wide open. Long-term investors considering this price correction might see opportunities amid uncertainty.

3 Realistic Assumptions About XRP‚Äôs Potential Value,XRPcharts,1i9lndn,2025-01-25 07:11:23,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRPcharts/comments/1i9lndn/3_realistic_assumptions_about_xrps_potential_value/,Cryptos4you,,"If money makes the world go round, XRP might just be the oil that keeps it spinning smoothly‚Äîexcept this oil is measured in drops.

1. Gradual Banking Adoption
XRP won‚Äôt take over the financial system overnight. It‚Äôs more realistic to expect it to start with niche use cases, like cross-border remittances, handling just a slice of the trillions of dollars moved daily.
 
2. Liquidity Drives Value
For XRP to process $1 trillion in daily transactions, its price could rise to $19.60 per token, and for $5 trillion, it might need to hit $98. With a finite supply of 100 billion XRP (51 billion circulating), higher demand would naturally drive its price upward.

3. Divisibility Offers Flexibility
Thanks to its design, XRP can scale‚Äîeach token is divisible into 1,000,000 drops, making it practical for both large-scale and tiny transactions:

‚Ä¢ Small-scale use: $100 billion daily could push XRP to $1.96/token.

‚Ä¢ Moderate use: $1 trillion daily might set XRP at $19.60/token.

‚Ä¢ Widespread adoption: $5 trillion daily could raise its value to $98/token.

This flexibility ensures XRP can handle everything from settling massive bank payments to buying a cup of coffee (well, a drop of coffee).

Insight: XRP‚Äôs future value isn‚Äôt just about moving money; it‚Äôs about whether it can make the global financial system faster, cheaper, and more efficient. If the world‚Äôs banks start trusting it, the sky‚Äôs the limit‚Äîor should we say, the drops keep falling.

I don't mind changing things around from time to time as the crypto world changes, but I'm not looking to make frequent trades. I know there's no guarantees and this isn't intended at all to be yet another ""do u think xxx coin is worth it"" but rather is a lot of diversification worth the stress of keeping an eye on 10-20+ coins versus just putting most into BTC and some other reasonably promising coins?

I saw someone else post a while back to just put 50-100% into BTC and forget about it for the next decade or two, similar to how SPY in stocks may not go 100x overnight but it's proven good returns and you can just leave it (yes I know that's an ETF and not a currency, speaking more about their usability as investments)."

Market signals show promising signs for $ETH despite lagging behind $BTC, $SOL, and $XRP, all of which have recently hit fresh all-time highs.  

Investors appear undeterred by Ethereum‚Äôs slow rally. In fact, accumulation is on the rise, with both whales and retail wallets scooping up $ETH over the past two weeks. Analysts attribute this confidence to Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi and NFT sectors, signaling strong long-term potential. 

Technical expert Kyle Doops believes Ethereum‚Äôs next big move could be on the horizon. His analysis reveals a consistent uptick in wallet activity and a rising Estimated Leverage Ratio, pointing to increased risk-taking in the market. However, he cautions that high leverage might lead to heightened volatility. Consolidated between $3,200 and $3,500, $ETH could be primed for a bullish breakout with traders closely watching these levels.  

Crypto analyst Milkybull has gone a step further, projecting $ETH could reach an ambitious $12,000 milestone. Bolstered by a Rising Wedge pattern, the formation hints at a potential spike that has traders buzzing.  

Currently trading at $3,381, Ethereum has seen a 5% rise in the last 24 hours, accompanied by a 60% surge in trading volume. Will $ETH finally break free and dominate the charts? Investors are certainly betting on it.

I had a golden goose and didn't know it,Ripple,1i9i0y3,2025-01-25 02:45:30,23,0.83,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/1i9i0y3/i_had_a_golden_goose_and_didnt_know_it/,Business_Accident576,,"I bought $XRP at $1.28 (AVG cost) in Q3-2021 having only started dabbling in the CryptoVerse back a few months earlier.

At that time, I didn't know jack about how different crypto was to traditional investments like shares etc.

After the market crapped itself, between Harmony ($ONE), Terra Luna ($LUNC), and Solana ($SOL), I was down by 92%.

Not a pleasant feeling, I must admit - let's call it COVID-madness.

NOW, with all the hoo-ha about XRP, I've done a bit of reading to find out what is the big deal, and why all you guys are so excited. 

At first, I was dumbfounded as to how it was any different to any other coin. Then I came across [this](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/16767579477001).

I noticed, all the major Australian banks were listed here. Sceptical as I was, I did more digging until I found [this](https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-12/c2023-403207-ripple.pdf) from the Australian Department of Treasury & Finance.

I'm now thinking, maybe it's time to get rid of the ETH/BTC and add more XRP and/or SOL. Now I can't decide which one (or both), I like them both.

What are your thoughts on my journey and buying more XRP?

Thanks in advance"
