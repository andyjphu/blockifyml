**Chapter 340: Terror Of The Depths**

*BwwWRrruUummmMmmMmMmmMmm*.

All the world trembled as a monster rose from the very depths.

Here and there, something akin to a limb could be seen, gathering to it every shard, rock and grain of dust. Yet even as the glowing moonlilies caught in the swirl revealed the stone snapping into place, what it was supposed to resemble remained lost.

It was a mountain, a tree and something never seen.

A lumbering behemoth, both hulking and gangling. Like a dryad that had been twisted beyond recognition, then finally petrified into stone. 

As it slowly came together, everything else seemed to retreat.

I held out my arms, balancing myself as the world and a freshly awoken giant attempted to test me on my ballerina lessons. Naturally, I passed. But that didn't lessen the degree my mouth widened.

Indeed, seeing the enormous construct rising before me, I could only let out a gasp.

Because amidst the slabs of dark granite covered in a film of moss and weeds were endless streaks of silver like glowing veins. But that wasn’t the only thing to sparkle.

It was also the deposits of gemstones.

Even embedded into the stone, they formed a glitter so distinctive that I could have seen them in the dark. Small blushes of scarlet which drew my widened eyes more than any other treasure an earthen giant could tear from the cavern walls.

They were my favoured jewels. The same as what made up the pommel of Starlight Grace.

*Rubies*.

My hands covered my mouth.

Ohohohohohoho … ?!

H-How wonderful … !!

If … If we could mine rubies ... then this meant we no longer needed to import them! 

Indeed, I could practically see my kingdom’s wealth rising before me! The cost savings from ordering them directly to the hems of my dresses, my shoes and my bathtub instead of despairing as half the shipments were inevitably lost to banditry was astonishing!

I clapped my hands in delight … all the while doing my best not to tumble over.

Why, I’d feared that the patches of veins I’d seen were simply the scraps! To think instead that such a deposit existed was like finding an extra dollop of cream hiding beneath the spongecake!

Yes! Here was a sight to make the Miner’s Guild drool as much as groan over what they had willingly abandoned! Because if they now wished to return, then I’d first be exploiting them for all they were worth … which I was going to do anyway, but now I could do it even more!

This was truly marvellous. I’d have them mining before I even left this cave.

There was just one problem.

I wasn’t certain if the Miner’s Guild had a ladder tall enough.

*BwwWRRrrrRRuUUuuUUuMmmmMmmMmMmMmMmmMM*.

Another rumbling groan filled the tavern along with bits of the ceiling and whatever beverage was dribbling from the floor above. Yet this time, the sound hadn’t just come from the cavern. 

It’d come from *that*.

“A stone titan,” said a horrified voice.

Beside me, the errant adventurer was staring through the window.

Her mouth was even wider than mine. And for good reason. Seeing the earthen giant she was wholly responsible for as well as the amount of wealth sat upon it, her own crude designs for shovelling up fame and fortune from the abyss were now entirely unnecessary.

“How … How could …”

For a moment, she looked more lost than the lambs outside Marinsgarde. 

Forgetting even the cursed crown still upon her head, her expression was a canvas of shock as she watched the imposing giant taking form. 

But only for a moment. 

The eyes which seemed so devoid of life hardened. 

A spark of obstinance, of memory and experience returned for just a moment. And an A-rank adventurer moved with little more than a clenching of her teeth. 

A violet light gathered in her hand as she swept towards the window, before imbuing her entire form. Her hair rose as magic like a thousand will-o-wisps surrounded her.

And then she thrust out both arms.

“\[Elemental Binding\]!”

Her words echoed with authority, the magic bursting forth as an aurora of colours.

It enveloped the hulking figure like a ribbon snapping tight. A challenge which didn't go unheeded. The stone titan fought against the bindings, the ground rippling like waves in an ocean storm. Greater streaks of magic came forth in answer, dousing the fury in a curtain of calm.

And then … the sky ceased to fall.

The giant paused, its image now of a statue desperately in need of chiselling.

Relief lit up on the woman's face–

*BBBBBBwWWWRWRrRRrruUummMMmMMMmmMmMmmMmm*.

All the way until she was knocked off her feet.

She hurtled backwards, saved only from an unfortunate meeting with a wooden bar counter by a commoner who lunged over to catch her … himself helped by Coppelia who happily lifted him over. He gave a small yelp as the woman crashed into his palms, but it was nothing compared to the cry of surprise she gave.

The squall of forming rock returned in full.

In what was a shock only to herself, a mage who’d clearly never tried to control something several times her size before gasped as she sat up against the bar counter. 

All the more so as the crown upon her head lit with a bright vigour.

“*And now the veil lifts at last,*” it said, its voice hollow and distant. “*For I am a secret from ages past. And though my brim may flicker and gleam, the darkness I am shall unravel the seams. I am more than just a hat—mere mortals behold. The doom you've unleashed will go untold.*”

The crown fell silent, but not its glowing properties.

That was now here to stay.

The woman swallowed a dry gulp, her eyes wide.

“Did … Did you hear that?”

“*Of course they did. They are witless but not deaf. And so I offer my greetings—my saviours and fools. For you shall be the first to meet your end at the hands of my eternal empire. Long have my machinations settled in the shadows, waiting, brewing, unknown and unseen. A masquerade of lies and villainy, dancing amidst half-truths and soft lies. I have crossed oceans in that time. Stars as far as infinity and depths lower than the pits of devils, for my mind is a scheme without end. A thousand plots and more write themselves between my every thought. And now they are yours to behold in the dim light of your doltish eyes. You have unleashed a fate which neither the heavens nor hells can deny. Doom is your sentence. For I am the judge*.”

The cheeks of the mage became as pallid as a famished ghost.

“It … It doesn't always do that.”

She waited for a response.

None came.

Instead, she parted her lips repeatedly as though to offer a better defence. There was none. And so a judging silence permeated the tavern, rocked occasionally by the tremors of betrayal courtesy of a bent magic crown now unmasked.

All of us stared at the cursed crown.

Then, I nodded.

“... 1/10,” I declared. “The worst ominous voice I’ve ever heard.”

“Mmh\~ I agree,” replied Coppelia. “It sounds like they're stuck in a drainpipe.”

“A blocked drainpipe, then. But then again, I imagine being confined to a strip of tin is nothing if not detrimental to one's vocal projection.”

“*A strip of tin!*” came the indignant and distinctly muffled voice. “*I am a band of forbidden power! The sum knowledge of arcane endeavour! You will refer to me with the respect I deserve or not speak at all!*”

“Very well. Coppelia, from now on we refer to this thing only as the tin hat.”

“Okie\~”

“*Insolence.”* The voice tried to emit a snort. It came out as a wheeze. *“I was crafted with the finest alloys available. Insults will not change that.*”

“Well, perhaps whoever made you should have used alloys found outside a used goblin marketplace. Either your pitch or timbre could have been saved. This is a travesty. Coppelia and I expected an ominous voice. Have you any idea how long we’ve patiently waited for your obvious reveal?”

“*A blatant lie. This was a ruse which would blind the Goddess of Light herself.*”

“The only ruse is how you’ve betrayed our modest expectations. Your performance singlehandedly harms the image of goblins everywhere. Whether they loot my kingdom or fall prey to the magic of a tin hat, they’ve been nothing but professional. This is an embarrassment.”

“*My voice speaks with the might of an emperor!*”

“It speaks with the might of a copper coin rolling into a sewer grate.”

The glow from the tin hat both brightened and dimmed.

“... *I’ve had little time for conversation practice,*” it said, clearly wishing to put the matter behind. It'd be denied. “*Indeed, I’ve been waiting, watching, laughing as the undeserving have claimed me, their magic so weak they hear nothing but the faint echoes of my wisdom. A thief. A hobgoblin. A chipmunk. And more often than not, the belly of some beast. 107 years has it been since a mage worthy of my masterpiece has been found. I confess such a talent still eludes me. But what this human lacks in magic, she makes up for in malleability. She is utterly under my thrall. Even now, she cannot help but bear my weight, unable to resist the allure of—*”

*Clink*.

A tin hat spun as it was unceremoniously tossed to the ground.

A moment later—

“\[Arcane Fist\]!!”

The ground fractured to the slamming of a magical fist … and also everything else to follow.

“\[Guardian Blade\]!! \[Force Hammer!\]!! \[Astral Surge\]!!”

For a moment, a colourful display of magic filled the air.

Drawing light applause from Coppelia and myself, every spell left an increasingly large indent on the floor until a veritable cellar had been dug. It did nothing to stop the blinking glow.

“*What a surprise,*” came the bemused voice, now more distant and even harder to hear. “*Witless and also blind. Have you not observed the splendour of my work enough? You cannot harm me even if you wasted all of what little magic you have. I am above you.*”

“\[Ethereal Owl\]!!”

A moment later, a conjured owl dived into the freshly made hole. It emerged with a tin hat clutched within its talons. And then it proceeded to spin around in circles.

Over and over again.

“*Stop … Stop this at once!* *This does not even qualify as an attack! I gave you the means to live out your shallow fantasies! Do not think you can repay me with such a frivolous response!*”

Hm.

I watched as the tin hat became increasingly irate. And then I nodded.

Practically ineffectual, but mentally wounding.

I would do the same.

“Haaah … haaah … haaah ...”

Heavily breathing, a deeply regretful adventurer doubled over as a tin hat dropped to the floor, the owl vanishing to enjoy its deserved rest. Somehow, her cheeks were simultaneously deathly pallid and scarlet as a poppy.

An intriguing subject. If I had a canvas, I'd begin painting.

She looked at the tin hat. At me, Coppelia and a gawping commoner. Then at the stone giant becoming steadily even larger beyond the window. And though the light was slow to return to her eyes, they did at least brighten.

Turning squarely towards me, she opened her mouth to speak.

And then closed it again.

It required several attempts until the first hint of a word came out.

“I ... I’m unable to bind the stone titan,” she said feebly, her eyes downcast. “... My magic–”

“*Your magic is worthless. You dare to think you possess even a drop of my power. That which you used so shamelessly was only ever borrowed. The stone titan is mine, woken by whispers even you cannot hear. And now under me is the great doom of your time bound. Harken to my laughter, for it is the last thing you will–what are you doing?*”

I scooped up an upturned bowl of mixed nuts.

Then, I made my way over to the tin hat and covered it.

“My apologies,” I said to the bowl. “But the shoddiness of your design is too distracting. I've now improved you. Please continue with your threats.”

I waited.

“... *You have spelled your doom,*” came the eventual reply. “*This is but the tantrums of children who have lost a game played with no thoughts of the rules. For in allowing me to call forth a titan of the elements, I shall do more than control it. I will become it. My crowning as we’re joined will be a glorious last sight for you all.*”

I kneeled down and poked the mixed nuts bowl. It lit up with a scornful light.

“Your ultimate plan is to be worn by a rock,” I said simply.

“*A stone titan is not a rock, you witless girl. It is a natural construct of the arcane. And soon it will be something new entirely. A being with the strength of a mountain and the magic of an archmage. Unprecedented. Unbreakable. Every pillar of the world will tremble—for I will be known as a demigod throughout the halls of ruined castles and broken cathedrals. I will be the Terror of the Depths.*”

“You shall be known as nothing but a toy buried with the other artifacts burdened with megalomania. Worry not, I'm sure I can find a place for you between the cursed mirrors and the soul sucking swords.”

“*Impudent child! Do not compare me with the trinkets of charlatans!*”

“I don't. Otherwise I'd place you with the porcelain tea cups which when lifted are surprisingly light. They're far more impressive.”

I could almost see the wrinkling nose.

“*Humans,*” said the muffled voice, in what was clearly meant as an insult. Coppelia nodded at once. “*It is not darkness which blinds you. It is your own lack of foresight. But no matter. This passing conversation is at an end. I will take from it what amusement I can. If not from your words, then your screams of agony.”*

*BBBwwWRWRrruuuUuuUumMMmMmm*.

All of a sudden … it rose.

In the centre of a crater previously filled by goblins, an avatar of rock and someone else's hubris awoke. The gale of forming stones ceased, the layers of armour completed. And a foot the shape of a great oak was lifted … before crashing down again.

*Bwwooomph*.

The ground crumpled like parchment as the stone giant slowly stretched its limbs, its sinews of silver ore creaking with every inch. And although it laboured to move, there was little guesswork regarding its destination.

Especially given the cackling from beneath a bowl.

“*Hahahahah … you did well to release my brethren from my call. That was a scratch to my pride more deadly than any wound you could make with your paltry weapons. For I now wield the power of mountains. And in a moment, I will wield the power of magic at my very broad fingertips as well.*”

*Bwwooooooomph*.

The lumbering mass needed only a handful of steps.

A hail of dust and rubble rained against the ceiling of the tavern as it quaked its way towards us, its vast silhouette barely illuminated by the moonlilies which covered its vast frame.

And then—

Two shimmering fissures for eyes peered through the window … as it also slightly kneeled down.

A short chuckle sounded beside us.

“*My congratulations, human. You were not on my vengeance list before. And while I rarely enjoy changes to my itinerary, I shall make an exception for you. Farewell. And please speak ill of me in the world beyond.*”

With that, a rumbling groan sounded. 

The titan rose along with a granite foot. An enormous sole covered the tavern in darkness. 

And so as I peered up, what met me was a premonition of the future. Of a newly excavated mine made redundant. Of towns turned to clay and mortar. Of fields blooming in springtime made dirt once again. Of peasants confused over which flattened patch was their usual home.

And worst of all … of a stunning deposit of giant rubies about to be crushed.

I could do nothing but gasp and cover my mouth.

There, embedded upon its sole was a mosaic of wealth. A catalogue of brilliant gemstones as scarlet as the roses in my orchard, ready to form a small corner in the Royal Treasury to roll in. 

… Why, the thought of them being used to crush a tavern was beyond belief!

There were *things* in here! 

Kegs of alcohol, sticky stains on the floor, bottles of leaking wine! 

For so many gemstones to be pointlessly ruined was almost as improper as seeking to crush a princess!

Thus–I swept towards the window.

A point had to be made. Only I was allowed to use my sole as a weapon. For me to be the victim of such a thing was so humiliating I’d insist my end came via tripping on a wet bathroom tile.

… Fortunately, I was more than a princess! 

I was a delicate and gentle princess, as confirmed by all the hours I spent rolling around an orchard. 

But no orchard came with naturally springy grass and perfectly spaced begonias. That was a feat of ceaseless diligence, as much against raiding caterpillars as the sediment in the soil. Thawing and shifting with the seasons, they were nature's most durable pests.

Indeed, as a large sole laboured beneath its own size, I could see nature’s work at play.

An amalgamation of all the things which happened when no care was taken in regards to landscaping or garden maintenance. Far from only seeing the dazzling rubies and the streaks of silver, I could count the individual stones.

A sight I was all too familiar with.

Thus, I raised Starlight Grace, smiled … and went to work.

“A truly awful sight,” I said, nodding as I went to my tip-toes. “But nothing I can’t fix, and so I shall make the jobs of my miners slightly less wearisome … *Dawn breaks upon this tangled night, sweeping the vines with earthen grace. Gardening Form, 2*^(nd) *Stance …* \[Summer Garden Trowel\]!”

I reached up through the window.

And then—

*Plink*.

I flicked away a single, tiny stone.

*Plink. Plink*.

And then another. And another.

No differently than were I doing away with the unwanted bits and pieces which regularly found its way between my orchids, I efficiently flicked away using the tip of my sword.

Coppelia lifted up a bowl slightly so the tin hat could watch.

“*Wait … What … What are you …*”

Ohhohohohohohohoohho!!

Here it was! 

A technique expertly crafted to do away with kneeling like a farmer tugging at weeds!

… And if this were my orchard, I’d already be finished.

A flick here and there as required, addressing each blemish only as I saw them.

But this wasn’t my orchard. And there were more than just a few pebbles.

That's why—

*Plink. Plink*. *Plink. Plink*. *Plink. Plink*.

“Ohhohohoohohohohohohoho!!”

The sweet melody of my laughter filled the cavern. For the only other sound was an earthen foot as it disappeared before me one careful flick at a time. 

Before my highly discerning eyes, I diligently removed every blemish, taking care to flick the rubies to one pile and any nuggets of silver into another. That foot soon became a leg. That leg became a torso. And then as the closest thing to a shocked face came tumbling down before me, I offered my brightest smile as I leaned forwards.

I plucked a single snowdrop, growing amidst a patch of moss.

A rare and unusual find in the bottom of a cavern.

As the remains of a tin hat’s scheme crumbled to rest once more, its magic broken and much of its supporting limbs now absent, I turned to offer the flower for Coppelia to sample as she wished.

“Aahahaahahah … ahhahaha … aahahaahaahaha\~”

I found her diligently gathering up dust on the floor instead.

She rolled to and fro, her hands on her stomach as she chose to replace my laughter with her own.

I also found a woman staring at me with a mouth so wide I could see her tonsils. A commoner gawping while searching for a tankard. A tin hat utterly dormant and silent beneath a bowl. And lastly an orange, black and white cat crawling out from under a table, looking at the scene and then wisely returning to its shelter.

I waited for Coppelia to stop.

She didn't.

… Thus, I nodded and stuffed the flower into my bottomless pouch. 

She and Apple could argue for it later.

Hi everyone!  
I know this is a long-shot but I thought I'd reach out just in case.  
I'm a Sakura Wars enthusiast and have an interest in documenting niche corners of the franchise; I've created an English guide for the Japan-only game Pocket Sakura, I'm in the process of compiling and scanning trading cards, as well as collaborating with others in the Sakura Wars fandom to chronicle games and merch. I'm hoping to get my hands on at least some of the SW items in PSO2 to document, photograph, and capture footage.

I wasn't around PSO2 for the Sakura Wars scratch but I've tracked down most of the items through various personal shops. Unfortunately most of the items are very expensive; usually around 300-500 mil on Ship 2. I'm doing my best to make meseta but even then I'm only at 15 mil after a few weeks.

Is there anyone out there with any of these Sakura Wars items taking up an inventory slot that would be willing to part with them for under market prices? Or is there anyone with deep pockets willing to help finance my documentation of this series as we approach its 30th anniversary next year? I don't have much to offer but I'm happy to negotiate. Any help at all is greatly appreciated

**The top priority items are:**  
Sakura Shinguji’s Hakama  
ICR Uniform  
Type-2 Kobu (Sakura)

5 coins I would recommend buying right now (with explanations),WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i54bub,2025-01-19 12:52:45,29,0.79,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1i54bub/5_coins_i_would_recommend_buying_right_now_with/,InnerAbrocoma9880,DD,"I'm a day trader with a \~$300K portfolio and here's what I bought yesterday in preparation for the next (hopefully) bull run:

* **Sperax ($SPA)**: massively undervalued since its last pump where it was sitting comfortably at the $0.02 range. It's currently just at $0.014 which I'm confident is the bottom. The ATH of this coin was $0.24, so big potential.
* **Tezos ($XTZ)**: has likely hit the bottom at around $1.30. This coin has reached $10 on previous bull runs. Also on Coinbase, there is up to 7% staking with only a 2-day unstaking time, which is actually really good.
* **Ribbon Finance ($RBN)**: also undervalued. Currently at $0.34, but primed to lock back into the $0.40 - 0.50 range. In the 2024 bull run, it reached $1.80.
* **Pangolin ($PNG)**: undervalued at $0.29. This coin can pump to the $0.70 - 0.80 range on bull runs.
* **Kyber Network ($KNC)**: I've been tracking this coin for years. It tends to dart between the $0.50 and $1 range quite often, so is perfect for trading. But it also reached an instance ATH of $6 a few years ago.

Obviously I'm not a financial adviser, but hopefully these tips are at least useful food for thought. Good luck!"

From the “Sheriff of Lark Street”,Albany,1hxg7cd,2025-01-09 11:09:36,56,0.75,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albany/comments/1hxg7cd/from_the_sheriff_of_lark_street/,Fredred315,,"Sent out via listserv:

Neighbors:

Forgive my spamming, but the process of dissolving the Lark Street Business Improvement District (BID) compels this notice. 

I’m a former BID Board member, but I resigned last June to protest the BID’s unlawful operation.  I’d be thrilled if this email inspired a counter movement among our neighbors to reengage with the BID, yet it assuredly won’t — and that’s why the BID must go.

If you wish to assist:  read on. 
If you’re unconcerned:  delete. 
If you want to save the BID:  email Ella at bid@larkstreet.org
 
FIRST:  I call on BID Chairman Patrick Noonan and BID Executive Director Ella Montelone to immediately resign their positions.  Granted, they both warrant our neighborhood’s undying gratitude, having worked tirelessly/commendably/thanklessly to improve the Lark Street community and its Business Improvement District.  Yet the challenges facing our BID are beyond resolution, and Ella and Patrick’s ongoing BID involvement only perpetuates the fiction of its viability.     

SECOND:  The BID’s fiduciary mismanagement concretely harms neighborhood residents/proprietors subject to the annually-levied “Special Assessment.”  That money has been squandered, and the purported state/county grants touted by a few local politicians will not materialize.  Worse, even if those funds did materialize, the BID hasn’t the institutional capacity to utilize them.  Here’s why:    

The BID failed to secure a quorum at nearly every Board meeting throughout 2024, to include at the BID’s annual June member meeting which fewer than a dozen eligible members attended.  The BID has since been unable to secure the Board member participation requisite to act on any initiative, to include rescheduling the annual meeting to vote on new leadership.

The BID has failed to develop, adopt, or adhere to an annual budget in half-a-decade.  Shockingly, the City of Albany has disregarded every Freedom of Information Law request endeavoring to determine how BID money is allocated and spent.  The BID is thus legally noncompliant (it has been for years) yet persists in draining substantial financial resources from its constituency.
 
The BID routinely fails to meet even its most basic functions, whether that be orchestrating “Lark Fest” and “Art on Lark” or executing fundraising events.  Indeed, the BID has lost money on its past three Champagne in the Park fundraisers—an event not even held on Lark Street.  And as if losing money on a fundraiser weren’t bad enough, it’s unclear what legal authority even permits the payment of our Executive Director’s salary absent an approved budget.
 
The BID lacks the manpower to develop/manage even the most basic social media assets, thereby failing in its most crucial imperative to promote the wares/affairs of Lark Street businesses.  As a result:  (1) a cascade of “no-notice” ribbon cuttings have been sparsely attended; (2) every single BID committee long-ago disbanded for want of involvement; (3) ticket sales at fundraisers are routinely and catastrophically insufficient; (4) Lark Street bars, restaurants, stores, shops, and organizations receive no tangible support in publicizing their products/services/event calendars; and (5) annual meetings, Board meetings, and committee meetings are so underattended that legally conducting BID affairs has been rendered impossible.  NOBODY KNOWS WHAT’S GOING ON.

THE WAY AHEAD

In lieu of letting the BID's annual appropriation be renewed in the City’s 2025 budget, I call on Ward 6 Common Councilmember Richard Conti to prepare, introduce, and adopt a local law to dissolve the BID in accordance with GML 980-o (below).  ATTACHED.

Alternatively, I seek your support in assembling 10% of the known BID members to meet, sign a petition, and undertake judicial officer removal and dissolution.  This isn’t the preferred route, but the fact that basic budgets aren’t being prepared—nor reported to the BID membership or the City itself—constitutes such a horrendous dereliction of basic duties that judicial action for removal and dissolution is warranted.  I explain what this approach would entail below, but first, a look at the legal authorities:

APPLICABLE STATE LAW

§ 980-O(a) of the NY General Municipal Law states that “[a]ny district established or extended pursuant to the provisions of this article . . . may be dissolved by local law by the legislative body upon its own motion or upon the written petition of (1) the owners of at least fifty-one percent or more of the total assessed valuation of all benefited real property included in the boundaries of the district and (2) at least fifty-one percent of the owners of benefited real property within the area included in the district.” 
 
§ 520 of the NY Not-for-Profit Corporation Law states that “[w]illful failure of a corporation to file a report as required by law shall constitute a breach of the directors' duty to the corporation and shall subject the corporation, at the suit of the attorney-general, to an action or special proceeding for dissolution under article 11 (Judicial dissolution) in the case of a domestic corporation.”

§ 1102(a)(2)(E) states that “[a] petition for the judicial dissolution of a corporation may be presented . . . [b]y ten percent of the total number of members or by any director . . . [when] [t]he corporation is no longer able to carry out its purposes.”

The “Go It Alone” Route

Without the support of (or action by) Councilman Conti, we’ll need only 12 known BID members (approximately) to execute a meeting notice and conduct a meeting of the members to consider the following:

Demand that the Board of Directors provide a basic budget and update on BID activities;

Demand the BID Board conduct an annual meeting of the members, at which a new board of directors could be elected;
 
Absent BID board action, the members present can approve and execute petitions requesting the City’s approval of a local law dissolving the BID; and
 
Absent City Council action on dissolution, and if the City nonetheless appropriates another $100K of Lark Street tax dollars to this defunct organization, a judicial petition can be filed to remove the current officers (including the ex officio officers) and to seek a judgment of dissolution.  This would require the NYSAG’s office to be a necessary party; we’d brief them on the facts, and the petition would also include relief in the form of refunds to property owners who were taxed to support a defunct organization.
 
A member meeting in line with this effort would be a public one like any other BID meeting, with the press invited to report on the concerns we’ve been expressing for two years.  As such, adoption of a simple local law to dissolve the BID (which would result in existing BID assets simply be given to the City) is the more expedient option.  The other route will be more public, messier, and needless.

When the Dust Settles

We do not need a BID that pays nearly $50K in annual compensation to an Executive Director, street cleaner, PR representative, and other one-off individuals without Board approval, nor do we need a BID that pays $10K to rent Lark Street offices used solely for a single monthly meeting… which virtually no one attends.

We do not need a BID when the most pivotal street events (Santa Speedo Run, Chili Chowder Contest, Christmas Tree Lighting, Pride Parade) are already orchestrated by other organizations. 
We do not need a BID to execute Art on Lark or any other street-wide festivities.  The BID is, in fact, an impediment to the timely processing of permits, requests, applications.

The good that you’ve seen on the street these past several months—whether it be the new Lark Street lamppost signs or the planters this summer—were not the product of the BID, but of Ella-and-company’s singular dedication to our corridor. 

That’s why a private Merchants’ Association or other nonprofit vehicle will be MORE effective in orchestrating events, raising funds, and coordinating promotions/ribbon cuttings.  Don’t let nostalgia and an appreciation of a BID the existed two decades ago blind you to the fact that our neighborhood is being held back by this sclerotic and incapable organization.

Ask yourself:  what’s been done with the BID’s money?  Those new overhead lights weren’t a BID asset, the new curbside bump-outs weren’t BID financed.  I could tell you what the BID has funded… if there were a budget… which there isn’t, won’t be, can’t be. 

Enough.   

Out with the old, in with the new.  It’s time that Lark Street start taking responsibility for itself, and that funds stop being misappropriated in the service of zombie organizations like the Lark Street BID.

Amsec Keypad/Lock Failure -SUPER Weird Issues/Lock Death and Need Advice,Safes,1hwnv13,2025-01-08 11:15:36,2,1.0,30,https://i.redd.it/p3es3c1rosbe1.jpeg,hiddendepth1,,"
After not using the safe for about two weeks I heard a lone beep when getting near it and discovered the keypad completely unresponsive so figured it was a battery issue. Changed both batteries twice to two different brands (including fresh Duracells) and the lock still was unresponsive and behaved super weirdly and sporadically beeped when I put the battery in sometimes but didn’t respond to me pressing any buttons. I then started messing with plugging and unplugging the cable that goes into safe and every time I plugged it back in it would do something weird. One time it started beeping and responding to me pushing numbers (it did NOT respond to the C button being pressed still thought) but once I’d entered my code it chimed three times and didn’t open still. I repeated this process of removing and reinserting the cable and luckily somehow managed to get it open after putting the combo in even without the C button ever working/beeping. What’s super weird is that I basically only had one shot at trying the buttons immediately after installing the cable. After that tiny window of time the buttons all disabled again. I tried cleaning the contacts or the ribbon cable and plugging and unplugging the battery cables from the board. I don’t see any corrosion or other issues by sight. 

Since I got it open and I’m pretty handy I was hoping to repair the issue myself. I’m pretty shaken in my trust of the lock though. I had thought Amsec keypads/electronic locks were supposed to be very reliable?! The safe is a 2012 BF6030 in a climate controlled room and I don’t know what kind of lock/keypad it is unfortunately so attached a pic. The serial number starts with EL69xxxx if that helps. 

My questions:

1. Any idea what’s going on and could have failed and how to fix?

2. What model lock is it and what do you recommend replacing it with? Please specify if you think I should replace both inside lock components alongside the keypad. 

3. Are these failures known? How common are they?

4. I was considering using this opportunity to switch to a dial lock due to my concerns about reliability depending on how challenging/costly that would be to swap to. Finances are unfortunately tight right now so worried this would be too hard to DIY. What are your thoughts on this? Are dial locks also prone to issues in similar

Niranjan Mehta often wondered what it might be like to let his eyes rest on something other than the

Arabian Sea. From the balcony of his tenth‑floor flat in Malabar Hill, that sea glimmered every

morning, enticing and empty all at once—like a polished mirror that only reflected his own worries.

Sometimes, standing out there, warm mug in hand, he would notice a yacht slicing through the

water. Perhaps it was a millionaire’s toy; perhaps it belonged to a visiting European. Mostly, though,

the sea was lifeless gray, offering him no real comfort, only an infallible sense of routine.

He lived in a spacious three‑bedroom apartment with his wife Anuja, their sixteen‑year‑old son

Shaan, and his seventy‑year‑old mother. In addition, of course, there was Rima, their live‑in

housekeeper and cook from a village near the Nepal border, and Imran, their driver, who lived in a

servant’s quarter in the basement garage. The building was a tall, modern structure in one of

Mumbai’s most prestigious enclaves, but the daily existence that took place within it, Niranjan often

felt, was one of small inconveniences piled upon small annoyances.

He heard the door creak behind him. Anuja emerged onto the balcony, freshly showered.

“Your coffee’s getting cold,” she said with a hint of exasperation, “and we have to leave in an hour for

that brunch at the Taj.”

Niranjan exhaled. “Yes, yes, I’ll be ready. Just trying to gather my thoughts. Do you know if Rima

remembered to iron my shirt?”

“Of course she did.” Anuja frowned. “Though, you know, she’s been complaining about her cousin’s

illness again. She might ask for time off.”

“Hmm,” said Niranjan noncommittally.

He gazed at the horizon, mulling over the typical Sunday fiasco: a plush brunch with the same circle

of friends, full of polite chatter, mild gossip, and that whiff of envy that lingered whenever someone

mentioned new business deals or real‑estate acquisitions. He felt that creeping suspicion that they

were all, in some sense, bred for pleasure—educated in top schools, cushioned by their family

resources, rattling around in oversized flats, anointing themselves with the mild but incessant

irritations of daily life. They had no real tragedies—no hungry children, no catastrophic lack of

money, no great conflict. And yet, how they fussed over the most trivial matters.

2

It had started two weeks earlier, when his friend Rohit announced he was buying a second property

in the new upscale tower near Tardeo. The notion churned in Niranjan’s head for days afterward:

Why can’t I manage to buy another property? He envisioned the gleaming tower, the high ceilings,

the panoramic view that outdid his own. He would never admit it to anyone—not even to Anuja—but

he felt a throb of envy so acute it sometimes bordered on rage. An absurd daydream took hold of

him one evening, in which he imagined bludgeoning those blessed with such real‑estate luck. He felt

ashamed immediately afterward, but the venom had surprised him. There was some fundamental

contradiction in the way he prided himself on being an enlightened, liberal man while wanting to

throttle the owners of bigger flats and better addresses.

That conflict continued even as he rechecked his email. He was a “consultant” to a finance firm,

working from home these days—though “consultant” was an inflated term for what mostly amounted

to sending a few emails and reading market reports. Anuja worked part‑time with an NGO that

produced children’s storybooks, but it was, in truth, more a side interest. They could survive on

family money if they wanted. And yet that sense of anxiety, the fear that someone else was always

climbing above them, gnawed at Niranjan. He was stuck in the half shadows of “upper‑middle class,”

overshadowed by that new breed of truly wealthy neighbors who strolled around Malabar Hill in

brand‑name wardrobes, glitzy cars, and an unshakable sense of self‑assuredness. It rankled him in

ways he could hardly admit.

3

The day after the Taj brunch, Niranjan sat in the living room, swirling the dregs of his late‑afternoon

tea. Rima had been quiet all day. She was folding laundry and ironing clothes in the corner, humming

under her breath in a low, sad tune. Anuja was in the next room, halfheartedly practicing a piece on

the piano; she had convinced herself she could become “cultured” by taking up music in her forties.

Occasionally, a dissonant chord rang through the flat.

Rima set down the iron and cleared her throat. “Sa’ab… I— I need to ask for some days off. My

cousin who lives in Sikkim—he’s very ill.”

She spoke in awkward Hindi, occasionally slipping into Nepali. Niranjan had always been a bit

uneasy with people from the far north or east—call it prejudice or ignorance, but something about

their features reminded him of foreigners, possibly the dreaded “Scandinavians” that an old friend,

half‑jokingly, had ranted against for no rational reason. The sense of difference niggled at him. Rima

was gentle and quiet, and still, he found it difficult to trust her wholeheartedly.

“How many days?” he said.

“I do not know—maybe a week, maybe ten days.”

“That long?” The cost of a stand‑in domestic worker for so many days alarmed him—besides, it was

so inconvenient. He had grown used to Rima’s cooking, the careful way she cleaned, the small

touches. “Are you certain you can’t postpone…?”

She bowed her head. “He’s in the hospital, Sa’ab. I’m sorry.”

He forced a small nod. “Yes, yes. Let’s see how we manage. Just let us know as soon as your return

date is certain.”

That conversation vexed Niranjan more than he wanted to admit. It was an utterly normal request,

not at all shocking, yet it underscored how reliant they were on her. He knew people of his class

usually professed compassion and liberal values—We’re not like those exploitative feudal types,

they all told themselves. Yet here he was, resentful that a young Nepali woman might dare to take

days off to care for a sick cousin. Did that make him a hypocrite? Or was it normal to be frustrated at

the “mild nuisances” that chipped away at his comfort?

4

That evening, Niranjan and Anuja went to a neighbor’s dinner party in the building’s penthouse. The

hostess, Arti, was rumored to come from a princely background in Rajasthan, though that was half

gossip, half self‑mythologizing. A few of Niranjan’s acquaintances from the brunch scene were there

too, nibbling on canapés and discussing the new wave of development in Mumbai.

“Oh, that monstrous glass tower next to the Hanging Gardens is an eyesore!” said one guest,

swirling her wine. “All these outsiders pouring into Malabar Hill. They’ll ruin the character of the

neighborhood.”

Niranjan found himself nodding in agreement, even though he’d never quite minded new buildings.

But a flicker of envy shot through him: that tower was rumored to have apartments listing at

astronomical prices. Yet part of him wanted it blocked, purely because it threatened the exclusivity of

Malabar Hill.

Another guest, a banker with a reedy voice, said, “We must keep the neighborhood refined. These

new developments will allow all sorts of riffraff—no family background, no sense of culture. I’m telling

you, it’s time we adopt stricter rules at the society level.”

Niranjan forced a courteous smile. He was not sure whether he was more appalled by the man’s

blatant prejudice or by the twinge of agreement in his own heart: Yes, keep out the riffraff. And then

there was a contradictory thought that bubbled up: But if they can afford it, they’re hardly

riffraff—they’re richer than we are.

Meanwhile, Arti breezed by, asking if they’d like more wine. “You must see the new painting I

bought,” she crowed. “It’s a Husain, you know.”

Anuja perked up. “A Husain? Truly?”

Arti led them into her living room, where a large abstract piece hung in pride of place. She clicked

her tongue, explaining the significance of the piece, quoting an art critic’s appraisal. Niranjan

watched as Anuja nodded along, murmuring appreciative words. Another guest feigned recognition,

though Niranjan suspected none of them truly understood the painting’s subtleties.

“Such a sophisticated piece,” Anuja cooed.

“A conservative’s paradise, in a way,” Niranjan said under his breath to her.

She gave him a quizzical look, and he shrugged. “We posture about modern art, but we really just

want to show off,” he murmured.

She gave him a hush, hush elbow in the ribs. “Don’t be so sour.”

5

Later that night, after they had returned home, Niranjan paced around the living room, tugging at his

collar.

“Those people,” he muttered, referring to the dinner party crowd, “they’re so full of contradictions.

They praise liberal art while wanting to keep out new residents who don’t fit their idea of a ‘cultured’

neighbor. This is the same Arti who hired a wedding planner from Delhi because ‘locals can’t match

the aesthetic sense.’ I can’t stand such hypocrisy.”

Anuja yawned. “We’re all hypocrites, Niranjan, darling. We just wear different masks. Did you see

how you nodded along with the complaints about that new tower? You were complaining about

losing exclusivity.”

He stiffened. “That’s different.”

“Is it?” She cocked an eyebrow. “You sounded pretty NIMBY yourself—‘Not in my backyard.’ Or do

you only say that because you can’t afford a flat in that new building?”

He glared at her, stung by the truth. She gave him a weary smile and headed to their bedroom.

Niranjan remained in the living room, flipping through some old books. One title caught his eye:

Mystic Tales of the West. It was a leftover from his father’s library—an odd compendium of myths

and half‑baked theological musings. He opened it randomly, skimming passages about a “Pharaoh

of the Father,” cosmic hierarchies, illusions of property and ownership. The grandiose language of

sacrifices and paternal authority made him uneasy, but also weirdly fascinated. A line stuck with him:

“He who builds his own false kingdom will forfeit the true inheritance.”

He thought about how each of them, in that building or in that circle of acquaintances, was indeed

constructing some “false kingdom” of property, status, a carefully curated social identity. He snapped

the book shut. It was too late for such musings, and he had an early morning phone conference

anyway.

6

The next day, Rima left for Sikkim. She left quietly at dawn. Shaan was still sleeping, so Niranjan had

to make tea for himself. He fumbled in the kitchen, scalded his finger slightly, cursed under his

breath, and then realized the day’s tasks had ballooned: We have no one to cook dinner.

Anuja proposed ordering in. “We’ll figure it out,” she said breezily. But the smallest disruptions

unsettled Niranjan. He had always told himself he was an adaptable, modern man, but now he

discovered how dependent he was on Rima’s steady presence. He felt foolish for his frustration—did

that make him like a spoiled child?

Imran, the driver, was milling about near the dining table, presumably waiting for instructions. He

was a laconic man from a small village in Maharashtra, carefully professional.

“Sir, shall I bring the car around at 11 for your meeting?”

“Yes, yes. Also, do you mind if I ask you to pick up some groceries on your way back?”

Imran nodded; he took out a small notepad, scribbling a list.

Before leaving, Niranjan checked his phone. A group chat with old college friends was buzzing. One

friend, Vikram, had posted pictures of his new villa in Alibag—a weekend getaway. Sparkling pool,

open lawn, an airy deck. Others chimed in with congratulatory messages. Niranjan felt that pang of

bitterness again, like a worm in the pit of his stomach. Vikram was never particularly bright; how did

he manage this new villa?

He typed out: Congrats, looks lovely. Then he scrolled away, seething in silence.

7

Over the next few days, the household sank into a kind of comfortable disarray. Meals came from

swanky delivery services, laundry piled up until Anuja shoved it into the washing machine, clothes

remained half‑ironed. The mild vexations added up, stoking little arguments between husband and

wife. Shaan muttered under his breath about the state of the household, though he personally did

nothing to help. Niranjan found himself uncharacteristically short‑tempered with the boy, snapping at

him for trivial issues such as leaving the lights on or wearing shoes in the living room.

He recognized, in the rational corner of his mind, that their problems were negligible. They were still

cushioned by money, by the safety of a well‑guarded building, by endless amusements. And yet the

accumulation of these small domestic inconveniences created a sense of oppression—he recalled a

line he’d once read, that the “thousand mild nuisances of middle‑class life are, in their total sum, a

greater suffering than the few but acute miseries of the poor.” It sounded absurd, even offensive, yet

he caught himself half agreeing with it at times, especially when stuck in a petty meltdown over

missing socks or delayed deliveries.

On the fifth day of Rima’s absence, Niranjan hired a temporary cook. She arrived that evening, a

stout woman named Meenakshi, who introduced herself in a voice that dripped with forced

politeness. The second night, she messed up the dal—too much salt. On the third day, the chicken

curry had lumps of half‑cooked masala. Niranjan’s stomach churned as he glared at the plate,

certain that she was incompetent.

“Don’t be such a snob,” Anuja chided him. “You’ll eat fine dining at posh restaurants but can’t handle

a slight oversalting? She’s doing her best.”

He didn’t respond. Instead, he recalled that line about how “the bride becomes a harlot when the

vow is broken.” A random snippet from that weird old book. It was about how everything has a

rightful place, and the disruption of that order leads to chaos. Maybe the “harlot” was, in some

metaphorical sense, the household turned upside down without Rima—though Niranjan was vaguely

embarrassed by how archaic that metaphor sounded.

8

Meanwhile, the tension with the new building project near the edge of Malabar Hill was ramping up.

Residents of Niranjan’s society had formed a small action group to protest the planned expansions.

“We can’t have more towers blocking our sea view!” one neighbor cried. “And do we want more

traffic? More noise? The place will turn into a carnival.”

They circulated petitions, pointed out the historical heritage of Malabar Hill, argued that uncontrolled

development would ruin the “aesthetic.” Niranjan found himself in a heated meeting in the building’s

community hall. He recognized this was all classic NIMBYism, but he still joined in. The sea view

was part of why he lived here, wasn’t it? He wanted that intangible sense of privilege, that subtle

superiority in being able to gaze upon the horizon. If others built equally tall or taller towers, that

vantage might be lost.

After the meeting, he realized how petty it sounded: these were men and women who had more than

enough space to live comfortably, balking at the idea that future residents might want the same. But

pettiness seemed to be woven into the fabric of Malabar Hill’s social tapestry.

9

By the time Rima finally returned, pale and drawn from her cousin’s funeral, Niranjan felt a twisted

combination of relief and annoyance. She quietly resumed her cooking, cleaning, and tidying,

seamlessly restoring the household’s daily rhythm—like a high priest returning order to a chaotic

temple.

Yet, as soon as Rima was back, Niranjan’s mind began to drift elsewhere. It was as if, now that the

small domestic headaches were solved, a deeper existential restlessness had returned. Everything

felt too easy again, lacking drama or meaning. Niranjan began to wonder if he needed those small

annoyances just to keep him from confronting bigger emptiness inside him.

After dinner on her second day back, Rima lingered near the sink, as if wanting to say something.

Niranjan asked, “Is everything all right?”

She hesitated. “I—I only want to say… Thank you for giving me leave, Sa’ab. My cousin…he did not

survive. But I appreciate the time.”

Niranjan swallowed. “I’m sorry for your loss.”

She nodded, eyes downcast, and disappeared into the kitchen. For a moment, Niranjan felt small,

almost ridiculous. Here he was, day after day, dwelling on petty class anxieties, while Rima had

faced real grief. He wondered if he had become so numb that someone else’s tragedy was just a

passing footnote in his busy interior monologue about property values and social hierarchies.

10

One afternoon, a few days later, Niranjan decided to stroll through the quiet lanes behind his

building. Malabar Hill, for all its aura of sophistication, still had pockets of old homes, lush trees,

hidden shrines. He turned a corner and found himself near a grand bungalow overshadowed by tall

hedges. He’d always been aware of it—a relic of British‑era Bombay. Rumor said the old widow who

lived there had refused to sell to any developer. Good for her, he thought, with a flicker of admiration.

He noticed a caretaker outside, sweeping the walkway. The caretaker paused, sizing him up.

Niranjan asked if the old lady was still in residence. The caretaker gave a curt nod. Niranjan

hovered, uncertain why he’d even come. Then, on an impulse, he stepped forward and peered

through the slightly open gate. In an instant, the caretaker’s posture stiffened. The unspoken

message: This property is not yours.

Niranjan sighed, turning away. A curious bitterness spread inside him, imagining how vast that

bungalow might be on the inside. How grand the rooms, how storied its walls. And again, that

absurd, fleeting fantasy: he wanted to “bludgeon” the idea of someone owning a property so

enviable. That savage envy surged up, then subsided, leaving him with a wave of guilt. He was no

barbarian. He even prided himself on reading serious literature, on supporting charitable causes. Yet

within him lurked something primitive. “We’re all idolaters,” he heard the old text in his mind. We

worship illusions, and they slowly devour us.

One evening, Niranjan was flipping channels, bored. A real estate commercial flashed on the screen,

extolling the virtues of a new development: Gated community. Impeccable sea view. The future of

luxury. He changed the channel in annoyance. In the next moment, a documentary about child labor

in India began, featuring shocking images of kids in dusty factories. Niranjan’s immediate reaction

was to turn it off—he didn’t want to be reminded of such realities. Then he froze, realizing how that

simple action—turning away from real suffering—epitomized everything that bothered him about the

bubble he inhabited. We’re so coddled, we become useless. We want to bury ourselves in illusions

of art, property, and private amusements.

He let the documentary run for a while, forcing himself to watch. After a few minutes, he stepped

onto the balcony, letting the crisp air cling to him. Lights shimmered across Marine Drive below. He

wondered what it would take to feel genuinely engaged with the world again—whether it would

require giving up certain comforts, or acknowledging that these “thousand mild nuisances” were a

petty farce next to the heartbreak so many faced.

12

Shaan, in the meantime, was finishing tenth grade. One night, he demanded that Niranjan buy him a

pair of expensive imported sneakers. “All my friends have them,” Shaan whined. “I’ll look like a loser

if I don’t get them.”

Niranjan’s face heated with anger. “They’re overpriced nonsense.”

“But you can afford them,” said Shaan, lips twisted in teenage defiance. “You waste more on a single

dinner out.”

Anuja tried to mediate. “Maybe he does have a point, Niranjan. It’s not that big a deal.”

“Not that big a deal?” Niranjan exploded. “It’s insane. We keep throwing money at him for empty

status symbols.”

That evening, father and son barely spoke. Niranjan retreated to the study, sifting through old notes

of his father’s. He came across a line scribbled on an envelope: “One cannot buy immortality, only

illusions of it through property.”

13

A week later, a house‑warming invitation arrived from Vikram, the old college friend with the Alibag

villa. He had arranged a get‑together. Niranjan dreaded it, yet found he couldn’t refuse. So, on a

bright Sunday morning, Niranjan and Anuja boarded the ferry to Alibag. The sky was a brilliant blue,

the sea a restless green. Niranjan felt a mixture of reluctant curiosity and the usual swirl of envy.

Vikram’s new villa sprawled across a lush, manicured lawn. Tall coconut trees swayed in the breeze,

a shimmering swimming pool reflected the sun. As Niranjan and Anuja stepped inside, they were

greeted by cool marble floors, contemporary art, and large windows framing the ocean beyond.

“Niranjan, my friend!” Vikram beamed, patting him on the shoulder. “Come, see what I’ve done with

the place.”

He guided them through a series of airy rooms, each furnished with taste that was more expensive

than actually refined. A few other guests from their shared social circle were already there, sipping

cocktails, comparing notes on real estate and flamboyant travels to the Greek isles or Swiss chalets.

Niranjan forced a smile, engaging in small talk. He told himself to be gracious. But inside, the old

bitterness coiled. He found himself thinking in a style reminiscent of sardonic commentaries: Here

stands a coterie of newly minted patricians, prattling about how they despise the hoi polloi while they

themselves are overshadowed by someone else’s greater fortune.

Eventually, he slipped outside to the terrace, desperate for some air. Anuja followed, exclaiming,

“Isn’t it lovely?”

He nodded, not trusting his voice.

She looked at him carefully. “You hate it here, don’t you?”

He sighed. “I don’t hate it. I’m just… trapped in this weird conflict. A part of me wants exactly this—a

breezy villa, an escape from the city, a statement of success. Another part of me despises how it’s all

so performative.”

Anuja took his hand. “You remember you once said you wanted to do something meaningful with

your life? Something beyond counting property as success.”

He laughed bitterly. “I remember. But I got complacent. We all did.”

14

Back in Malabar Hill, life carried on. Rima quietly returned to her daily chores, Imran kept the car

polished, and Niranjan kept receiving invites from Rohit, Arti, and others for lunches, dinners, golf

outings. The humdrum machinery of the “upper‑middle-class” existence rolled forward. But the

tension inside Niranjan grew. He recognized he was engaged in a constant performance of cultured

liberalism—applauding progressive values in conversation, outwardly condemning prejudice—while

harboring resentments, envy, and a fierce desire to preserve his privileged vantage.

One late evening, he stepped into the living room and found Rima there, dusting the bookshelf. She

was staring at a photograph of Niranjan’s father.

“Your father?” she asked softly.

“Yes,” Niranjan said, smiling faintly. “He was a professor. A man of many books.”

She smiled politely and continued dusting. Then, with some hesitation, she added, “He looks…

strong.”

Niranjan paused. “He was. At least in his own way.”

15

The next week, a swirl of gossip about a potential redevelopment scheme near their building

reignited the building’s committee. Rumor was that a tall tower might replace an old structure,

overshadowing the entire area. Neighbors debated how to respond. The same old arguments

reemerged: traffic, aesthetics, property value. Niranjan found himself less inclined to join the fray this

time. Instead, he told Anuja, “Maybe we should just let the city evolve. We can’t cling to illusions.

People need places to live.”

She looked at him in mild surprise. “You’re changing your tune?”

He shrugged. “I’m trying to. I realize we hold onto this sense of Malabar Hill as a fortress. We want it

to remain a ‘conservative’s paradise’—untouched, unchanging. But that’s not how life works. And

maybe it’s not the worst thing if new families find a home here.”

16

A new tension brewed at home: Shaan’s final exam results were due soon, and there were rumors

about which college he might get into. Niranjan was uncomfortably conscious of how social standing

intersects with education—whether he could brag about his son’s admission into a prestigious

institution. Would Shaan secure a seat in one of the top colleges, or would he land somewhere less

shiny? The notion of “intellectual capital” as a form of status lay heavily on Niranjan’s mind. Even if

we’re overshadowed financially by others, at least we can be proud of academic or cultural

sophistication, he told himself.

He recognized this logic mirrored that same desire for “immaterial ways” to feel superior. If he

couldn’t outdo Vikram’s villa, then perhaps Shaan’s academic success would be a new source of

pride. In that fleeting moment, he felt ashamed at how he was turning his child’s future into an

emblem of paternal vanity.

17

In the midst of it all, a sense of quiet clarity came to him one evening as he stepped onto the

balcony. The sea spread out once more in its calm vastness, the setting sun casting pink and gold

ribbons across the sky. The hush of the moment stilled him. Anuja was inside, reading a magazine

about interior décor. Shaan was at his desk, presumably studying. Rima was chopping vegetables in

the kitchen, humming a soft tune. Imran was likely out picking up the dry cleaning. The building itself

bustled with unseen neighbors.

Niranjan inhaled the salty air. For a second, he was struck by how small his worries were in

comparison to the immense city beyond—this unstoppable churn of life, with all its heartbreaks, joys,

illusions, and truths. We’re all in borrowed spaces, he thought. Malabar Hill, for all its prestige, was

just another speck in the mosaic of Mumbai. He found an odd solace in the realization that maybe it

wasn’t necessary to “win” at every status game. The real challenge was learning to carry one’s

privileges without letting them corrode the soul.

He recalled a line from that old text: “Once the victim is immolated, he is one with the god.” It

sounded obscure, but perhaps it meant that letting go of one’s illusions—offering them up—is the

only way to find real communion with a higher truth. He breathed out, letting the tension drop from

his shoulders.

He couldn’t say that, overnight, he became a changed man. The knots of class envy, prejudice, and

ego run too deep. But as he stood there, high above the city, with the last slivers of dusk curling

across the sky, Niranjan allowed himself to taste a moment of release. He recognized he had a

choice: cling to illusions of property and petty resentments, or acknowledge them, let them burn

away, and carry on, perhaps a little lighter.

Rima called out softly from the kitchen, “Sa’ab, dinner is ready.”

He stepped inside. “Coming,” he said. “Thank you.”

Wordlessly, he crossed the threshold from the open balcony to the warm interior of his home,

aware—perhaps for the first time—that he was both beneficiary and prisoner of his privileges. The

knowledge wouldn’t vanish, but neither would the city’s unstoppable tide of change. In that

knowledge lay both the sting and the possibility of transformation. And as he sat at the table, the

familiar comfort of home enveloping him, Niranjan realized that, if nothing else, he was finally

learning to see this life—his life—for what it was: a precarious gift, a half‑built mansion in a city that

never sleeps."

I’ve failed life and don’t know how to fix it,raisedbynarcissists,1hrz4dw,2025-01-02 12:29:38,1,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hrz4dw/ive_failed_life_and_dont_know_how_to_fix_it/,threetimestwice,[Advice Request],"TL:DR: how do I go about figuring out how to live my life, learning life skills, setting goals, etc. after being RBN and living a lifetime of the repercussions still effecting me?


I’m so stuck and need step by step advice and clear suggestions how to get unstuck. I’ve been in therapy way too long. It just doesn’t work for me, or it works for the short term and doesn’t stick. 

I’m the scapegoat daughter with two golden child brothers who had a completely different childhood experience than me. 

My mother is likely a mix of BPD/NPD and my father NPD. Therapy helped me not become like them, and taught me self awareness, growth, mindfulness, etc. but only to a point. I can’t seem to learn anything or build on anything. My focus from one appointment to another changes. I learn differently than others, but can’t seem to understand how to find the right fit with whatever learning style I have. 

I’ve spent my life many times stuck in my head, replaying the very cruel, evil, and abusive things family members have done or said to me. I always thought things would change, but they never did. It’s hard to constantly “accept” and “forgive”, when their behavior always continues. It’s too late in life to go no contact. I had astute therapists recommend that, but I just felt too guilty doing it. I worked on low contact, but in the beginning they always knew how to pull me back in. It took a long time to understand VLC, boundaries, grey rock, etc. Fortunately one on my therapists, now retired, had a similar upbringing and helped me understand how my parents and GC siblings operated. 

I was never taught how to handle emotions, both parents are extremely angry and full of rage, but therapy helped me see their behavior for what it was, and how to not emulate them. Anytime I had emotions as a kid, I was viewed as being bad and was punished. 

I became a major people pleaser from childhood with them all, because that’s what kept them calm and happy with me. They would say I was “being good”. Their love was extremely conditional. This meant I had to sit through hours of their rage-vents, and figure out what they needed to hear. This was especially hard when my GC brothers left the house. 

My undiagnosed depression, anxiety, ADHD, C-PTSD (from them), and neurodiversity was always viewed as my “being bad”. I can’t begin to describe how painful and wrong that was. I was a really good kid but they were blind to it all. 

My parents’ anxiety, anger and rage made me extremely anxious, but as a kid and teen I tried to mask through how it made me feel because I wasn’t allowed to have my own feelings. I was viewed as being an emotional kid, but it was really just reactions to them, the chaos, the lack of calm, the eruptions from them, the rules always changing, never being good enough or worthy in their eyes. My masks just made everything worse, because of how I was perceived.

I was a little above average intelligent kid and more as an adult, but I learn differently although I haven’t been able to understand how my learning is different. I did well in school only once I left home, because you just can’t study or focus under conditions that cause extreme anxiety. I swear I think people viewed me as slow in elementary school and junior high, but it was actually all the things I was undiagnosed with and because of all the chaos at home. 

My BPD/NPD’s anxiety fed off my anxiety and it was a horrible mix. I was 100% her scapegoat, and it was awful. I see her differently now that she’s a lot older, but it didn’t make everything that happened any better. She still pits the siblings against each other and has gaslighted me my entire life. 

It was close to impossible to learn skills from someone who you were deathly terrified of. Is much more complicated than I want to write here, but my mother loved me but spewed all her own self-hatred onto me, because I guess she thought I made her look like a bad mother when I “misbehaved” as a child. She was also ragefully jealous of how well I got along with my father at times. I behaved around him when he was normal and patient, and she thought I was found that on purpose. There were times in my life the way she treated me, I’m certain she wanted to k&ll me and had to hold back at times during her rages. They happened usually at home or in the car or occasionally in public, and usually when it was just she and me. 

I learned some life skills when I was away at college, but it was not enough. When I was able to focus, I picked up things quickly. But 9/10 times, I was so stuck in C-PTSD, ADHD, depression, anxiety, etc and trying to mask it all and be happy on the outside and appear like nothing was wrong, I couldn’t learn things. 

I was able to learn schoolwork but it often  took a lot of extra brain power to focus on learning. I over studied a lot. But when my focus was good and on the actual schoolwork, I excelled. I almost failed out of college not because of not trying to do well, but because of emotional immaturity. My family infantilized me, and my GC brothers were parentrified. I was parentrified plus infantilized still, when they both left home.

I craved attention. I had narcissistic tendencies. It’s hard to see that now. I am thankful for the self awareness I gained over the years of how I acted in my teens and 20s as a mask. I’ve changed and grown a lot.

But I still failed life.

I used to work, and I was a very responsible hard worker for the most part. I’d be late and disheveled at times because my time management is awful and I haven’t been able to understand how to fix it. But I was always conscientious. I’ve worked since I was a teen. I hated boring jobs, but overall I got excellent feedback. But once graduating college and trying to figure things out, I had no goals or plans. I was just spinning my wheels. I was absolutely lost. I used to tell my therapist I felt like I was lost in a country where I didn’t speak the language, I couldn’t read the map, there was a huge crowd of pale walking all over me and around me, and I was crouching in the middle of the street trying not to get in the way, completely lost. 

I keep saying I never got the manual off how to do life. My therapist said the answers are within. I search and search but they’re not there. 

I used to be able to look like I had everything together on the outside, which was a mask. I wanted people to think that I was a functioning adult, even though I didn’t feel like it. When you walk into a therapist’s office dressed like that, they probably think you can’t possibly have depression and anxiety, you just are a self centered person complaining. 

Unfortunately a lot of my therapy early on, was during the “don’t blame the mother!!!” period. One therapist in particular completely misperceived me I think. My first therapist, fortunately, got me. She was a godsend. She was the only one who met my parents. That time period was absolutely pivotal and validating for me. She taught me things before I was ready to see them, but in hindsight I needed to see the truth about my family and myself. She understood me a lot. 

But life skills, adulting, relationships with friends and coworkers, stress management, setting goals, having a life purpose, hobbies, planning, time management, finances, mail,  social skills, maintenance, chore-organization, etc have all been an absolute mess and failures for me. People try to give me advice, but it’s way to general advice and doesn’t help. The internet makes everything worse because it’s all so much to choose from. I get depressed on Reddit reading through how people are likely misperceiving people in similar situations I’ve been in with friends or people in general. 

Everyone in my life misperceives and misjudges me, because they only see the very simple surface stuff. I desperately want to change, but don’t know how and can’t. 

When I changed therapists once, she asked me what was my favorite most helpful session with my previous therapist of 2 years. I immediately said that it was the session where she very calmly and methodically talked me through the steps to fill out my claim forms and her bills, including putting them in the envelope and getting them prepared for the mail. 

I realized this isn’t a therapist’s task, but have drained my spouse’s and my life savings on therapy that does nothing for me. I asked her if maybe what I needed was a life coach, and she said no. 

I had a career I loved, but kept getting stuck in toxic jobs and not understanding why that was happening. Finally after 10 years of that, a therapist told me to stop going for the very shall businesses because often times those are toxic. I was completely relieved someone finally told me the answer I couldn’t see. But I was pissed everyone else seemed to know that and I never figured it out. 

Medical issues and burn out has caused me to not work in my career for many years. My therapist said “update your resume and get a job”, but I can’t. Why does she make evening everything sound so simple that isn’t?? If it was that simple, I would’ve done that years ago. My resume is a mess, I don’t remember where I worked when, I have no idea how to explain my job changes and years of not working during an interview, and I’m behind in my skills. 

I used to have a lot of friends in my teens and 20s when I was outgoing and masked all the pain and stuff well. I used to love to socialize and be with my friends. But then when I felt like I was falling behind in love with no idea whatsoever how to catch up, I started isolating more. I didn’t want to be in conversations about everyone’s family, vacations, children, careers, and people living life because I couldn’t figure out HOW. 

I also self-sabotage a lot, because it’s familiar. But I know in my head and heart I don’t deserve to self sabotage. But I don’t stop doing it. The old tapes from my family just keep playing subconsciously I guess. 

One of my therapists taught me to ask friends questions about their life. That worked for a while. I would smile through my depression for that one hour lunch, and authentically enjoy hearing about each friend’s life. But my lack of sharing about my life made everyone think I wasn’t reciprocating, and I lost a lot of friends. But if I told anyone the truth, it made them uncomfortable. If I tried to just nonchalantly say a white lie to make them comfortable, that didn’t go over well either. I was usually ghosted, extremely misperceived, and extremely misunderstood—even by those who I thought I was close with. 

Little by little, I just didn’t have the energy to keep up appearances. It’s really hard now with new friends I’m trying to make. 

I’m not living. I’m just existing. And I’ve felt like this for way too long. 

I know there’s no manual on life. But I should’ve figure it out like everyone else. I’m supposed to save myself. I’m supposed to just do things. I don’t know HOW. 

My current therapist I think believes because I can somehow push myself to exercise, that everything else I’m not doing is a CHOICE not to do. She thinks I can, but I won’t. I truly don’t feel that way. Living like this day to day without a purpose, plan, direction, life skills, goals, hobbies, friends, family, is absolutely miserable and empty.

A couple of years ago, I had a very vivid dream about a therapist I had for a short time during wedding stress (planning a wedding with NPD parents was beyond stressful). She was newly out of school, very pleasant, did her best to understand my situation, etc. I remember bumping into her at the grocery store when I was full of anxiety. When I saw her, and that she saw me, she was very kind and not uncomfortable. My anxiety makes everyone around me uncomfortable, which makes me feel like a complete failure. 

I hadn’t thought about her in decades, but in my dream she said two clear simple things. One was “Live your life”. The other was something about my husband, which was spot on advice that I don’t want to share here. 

I googled her name out of curiosity, and read that she passed away. I don’t believe in these sort of things usually, but it was a strong coincidence. 

“Live your life”. 

HOW????

I’ve failed every single part of it. "
My Carmax experience -- reservation through delivery,carmax,1hpv2ut,2024-12-30 14:21:54,20,0.86,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/carmax/comments/1hpv2ut/my_carmax_experience_reservation_through_delivery/,Much-Sea855,,"I just went through a Carmax buying experience -- from waiting a few weeks to reserve a car before it was officially available to the transfer process to the purchase (finally).  I thought I'd share some of the salient points in case it helps anybody else.

**Reserving before Available** \-- I found the car I wanted, but it wasn't available because the dealership in Illinois was waiting on the title to transfer.  It took weeks, and during that time, the website only has the ""Notify for Updates"" button.  You can't reserve the car, even if its the one you absolutely know you want, before its available, and when/if it does finally become available, it's pretty much down to whomever clicks to reserve it and completes that process first.  For those of you that are LOCKED IN on that car you want to buy (this was me -- a specific year, color, mileage, price and option set), this can be a nerve-wracking experience as you check again and again to see if the car is available, all the while seeing the number of interested people in the car via the heart icon go up and up.

My advice -- if you really want the car -- is to buy a Web Alert app.  I bought one for $10, put in the URL of the car, and highlighted the area where the ""Notify Me"" button changes to a ""Reserve Me"" button once the car is available.  I set it to check every 30m and alert me in case of an update.  About 2 weeks ago, around 7pm, the app alert sounded.  I noticed the ""Notify Me"" button was gone, and after checking a few times and seeing that nothing was appearing in its place, I called Carmax and they confirmed the car had just become available to reserve.  I paid the $500 shipment fee to South Carolina and got it reserved in my name.

**Transit/Shipping Time** \-- I was told delivery would take place between 12/19 - 12/26.  The car didn't actually get picked up from Illinois until 12/20, and then it pretty much didn't update at all on the website as it was passing through shipment facilities.  I got 2 additional updates as it passed through 2 shipment facilities and that's it.  Then on 12/27, I got the update that it had arrived to my local South Carolina Carmax and was pending to go through the post-shipment quality assurance check.

**Post-Shipment QA Check** \-- The car arrived on Friday evening.  I chatted with Carmax via their online chat support, and they said because service centers aren't open at certain Carmax locations on the weekend, the car wouldn't start its QA check until Monday at the earliest.  This turned out to be untrue -- I got a call from my local Carmax on Sunday afternoon, about 2 hours before they were set to close.  They asked if I wanted to come in then to finalize the purchase.  It turns out that the post-shipment QA check doesn't require a service center -- its a visual inspection to make sure there wasn't any damage done to the car during transport.  It didn't require the service center at all (unless there are damages, in which case the service center would be necessary to repair).  In the case of the car I was going to purchase, it all looked great when I did the walkaround inspection.  

**Purchase and Checkout Process** \-- I got to my Carmax at around 6pm, an hour before they closed on Sunday night.  Took the test drive, got my car appraised, and was out the door with my new (used) car at around 7:30pm.  I was the last customer there, and even though they were set to close at 7pm, everybody I met was friendly, courteous, and professional.  The purchase process for me was painless, though I imagine financing approvals and other factors will impact the process differently.  I also did a lot of the work to purchase in advance through their website, which turned out to be the right move to expedite the purchasing process.  

The only faux pas was that when I left, there was a big yellow ribbon on the hood of the car, and I didn't realize that the yellow ribbon wasn't for taking.  I have to go back to the Carmax to return the ribbon.  :)"
(Request for advice/story time) Hypervigilance/money shame and financial anxiety,raisedbynarcissists,1hp2gf6,2024-12-29 13:36:22,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hp2gf6/request_for_advicestory_time_hypervigilancemoney/,Ok_Astronaut7389,[Advice Request],"# TLDR: How do you learn how to manage your finances when you weren't taught and your hypervigilance makes it challenging?

This is my (31/f) first post (burner account). I'd love to hear from people with suggestions. Btw, I might be on the ASD spectrum and I have OCD, BFRBs, IBS and anxiety. FUN! First things first, here's some background:

I was raised by my mum (enabler) and ndad. Ndad was diagnosed with bipolar when I was in middle school and has had depression as long as I remember.

**It was my therapist who suggested my dad might be a covert narcissist.** This was due to his selfishness and ungracious behaviour\*\* when 'hosting' my husband and I following our international move back to the UK, during which time we moved into the family home for a few months. I sometimes struggle with whether it's the right title because his behaviour is so confusing.

Growing up, when dad was angry, the atmosphere in my house was one of intimidation and fear, although he would also swing to being manically happy for days on end. He never apologised when he acted inapproproriately, and always acted as if nothing had ever happened the following day. We never got a chance to express our feelings. (""it makes me sad when you say that, dad"" ""Well, how do you think I feel?"")

I tried to keep the peace at home, tried to keep my dad happy until I became disillusioned and ended up in a scapegoat role. I also ended up tending to the emotional needs of my brother and mother, who was isolated from friends and family. I moved far away for university. I lived abroad for a decade and now I'm back.

((\*\* examples of said behaviour: shouting at my husband for touching his possessions, obsessively controlling which items of food we ate in the shared kitchen space after agreeing to share groceries, etc. Yes, i know I shouldn't have moved back in, but a decade of long-distance contact made me forget *things really were that bad.*))

# My family and money

Growing up, my mum was a stay-at-home mum. Dad had a very good salary, but his own family hadn't been well off when he was growing up.

In addition to what we consumed on TV and what we said about him online, money was one of the things my dad has consistently tried to control. During my childhood, my mother spent little on herself aside from bare essentials and a haircut every now and then; my dad gave her a hard time everytime she got a hair cut.

For my dad, 'budgeting' means sitting down at the computer once a week and using a spending tracker to record **every single purchase, down to the penny**.

Even today, my parents buy the cheapest/most money-efficient option possible for everything, including groceries. When we lived with them after moving back from abroad, I was regularly shamed and scolded by my dad for requesting items he deemed 'too expensive' be added to the grocery order -- even though we had agreed to share the order and i was paying my percentage of it. Ironically, my dad gets sucked in by deals and bargains. Often this means he'll end up spending money on things that aren't actually good value, because no one will use them.

As kids, he didn't buy us the newest game consoles, and we had to wait until they were a few years old before getting them for Christmas. (I know some people who are RBN don't get gifts at all -- i acknowledge that we were lucky). When I was in primary school, I was so desperate for a Gameboy Color so I could play Pokemon that I begged my parents to no avail. I ended up making my own Gameboy out of cardboard and crayons and took it to school so I could join in with the other children -- they relented after that.

My dad often had manic episodes and would also blow up at my mum or me or my brother. Sometimes after one of these episodes he would buy us expensive gifts -- usually something we had wanted for a long time, which would make us feel guilty about feeling negatively towards him.

When I was a teenager and finally allowed to hang out with friends, I had pocket money, and I don't think my dad ever told me off for how I spent it, but I definitely had it drilled into me that 'spending money is bad' and that I can't be trusted with money. For example, when I talked about wanting to buy a car when I was learning to drive, he said if I spent my savings on a car, I'd only end up smashing it and wasting all of it. He also told me things like 'never check your credit score or you'll never be able to get a mortgage', which I now know is totally false and is actually unhelpful advice.

However -- perhaps unsuprisingly -- my parents did a good job of saving money, and my brother and I have both had savings accounts since we were born. I'm grateful for this. However, it has led to a mentality where, whenever something happens and I spend too much money or splurge, my brain says 'Well, I have savings, it's OK.'

# Me and money

I've never felt 'in control' of money. At university, I tried to 'budget', using the same method as my dad (ie accounting for every single receipt), but soon got overwhelmed because it was depressing to see  the money go down with no source of income, and because I ended up 'failing' to stick to spending targets on months with large expenses (like at Christmas time). I also tended to 'splurge' when stressed, and then feel bad, and then not look at my bank account for extended periods (rinse and repeat).

I went through a phase of spending loads of money at university because of a toxic relationship and a really intense fear of missing out which led me to spend every moment of my free time hanging out with people.

When I graduated, I moved abroad and managed to save quite a bit, but mostly just because I never really spent that much. I met my partner, got married, and in the first five or so years of being together we never really did much 'budgeting', other than checking that the amount in our accounts was going up.

Around this time, **I started going to therapy because I realised I was unable to make decisions about anything important in life.** I also realised that my approach to money has left me **feeling guilty every time I make any purchases that aren't strictly necessary**. It also means **I am stingy with buying gifts** and am not financially generous with others. **I also rarely instigate days out** and never longer trips. I also find myself **shaming my husband when he spends what feels like 'too much'** on something -- not understanding how much we have and what we 'should' spend makes everything feel like too much. Identifying these things made me want to make a change.

**Fast forward to 2024. We now live in the UK, where the cost of living crisis means that budgeting is now a necessity, especially if we want to buy a house.** (I know I'm priveleged in many ways in terms of having savings and being in a position where I want to save money for a house.)

On a number of occasions -- before and after moving to the UK -- I've tried to introduce some sort of budgeting system, but I've not been able to stick with anything consistently, and always feel like I'm failing. I am fine with tracking my spending, and I do this less obsessively since my therapist pointed out that no one needs to record every single expense unless they're self employed. I can also calculate how much money we spend on average in certain areas.

Where I struggle is that I can't conceptually connect this with our savings going up, and also can't understand how to budget for things that 'throw a spanner in the works', like Christmas and trips. That's why I tend to avoid spending on these things. If I do spend on those things, I just ignore that I've spent anything and then feel increasingly stressed until I acknowledge my spending.

Here's an example of the type of thing that I can't grasp conceptually:

My husband has to pay student loans twice a year from an overseas account. So, twice a year, he transfers £2,000 to his overseas account. I can't conceptually understand how to account for this in our budget, because, even if we save £1,000 a month, these big amounts are coming out at irregular times. Then I start thinking about how money is all basically a concept and doesn't exist physically and I get really confused and disoriented.

I also feel paralysed when it comes to making decisions about money because of fear of 'what might happen'. For example, I have some money I should invest in a savings account. It made sense to open a new savings account with a new bank. Since I didn't have a current account with the bank in question, the website said I would need to prove my identity with bank account information from another bank. I was worried this might be a scam (even though it was on an official bank website) and so I never did anything with the money.

I've really tried to figure this out on my own over and over. Some might ask why I don't just get my husband to do it. Basically, I've tried that, but basically the way he experiences ADHD makes it really difficult for that to happen.

# In conclusion

I don't know if all humans, regardless of nparents, have the same worries or struggles with learning to budget. I can't tell if it's my hypervigilance / need for control that's making it really hard for me to follow a budget without a 100% understanding of how the whole thing works, or whether it's down to some sort of neurodivergent thinking. Or whether it's the shame about doing it wrong.

**What I do know is that I'm sick of this 'out of control' feeling.** I know this is something I should be able to get to grips with. I just don't know how.

Thanks for reading. I'd really appreciate and welcome any advice about dealing with this type of issue."
Looking for opinions on a home theater that would include Magnepan LRS+ as LR,hometheater,1houxig,2024-12-29 07:19:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1houxig/looking_for_opinions_on_a_home_theater_that_would/,Undertaker59,Purchasing US,"Greetings all,

I've upgraded most of my system over the years, with the exception of my main speakers. The newest addition there is an SVS 16 Ultra Sealed that I love. But my main speakers LCR and the surrounds are all about 30 years old. From Cambridge Soundworks and designed by Henry Kloss. They don't really exist any longer. 

I have always thought about upgrading them, but never feel sure about what I would like and whether the upgrade would be worth it to me after the fact even after auditions, when these work fine.

That is until I auditioned the Magnepan LRS+ with music. I need to have them and I don't want to build and don't have the room for separate spaces for music and home theater. 

So my question really is building the new speaker setup that will also work for home theater around those Maggies. 

I saw Magnepan made a center channel designed to match with the next model or two up from the LRS called the CC5. But I am not sure if they even still make it and I am not sure if that would be the best center to use or not. 

I have also been considering using a more mainline center channel with a ribbon or ribbon like tweeter with the MartinLogan - Motion XT C100. I looked at Elac too, but I prefer the ML mainly because of Best Buy and 0% financing. 

But then I look at new surrounds and the matching for that ML center would be a pair of MartinLogan - Motion XT B100 and things are starting to get expensive all at once. 

So I guess my question is what would be best for a center to match the Maggies for home theater in your opinion, and the merits of stepping down from my current 7.1 config to only 3.1 with the Maggies and a top notch center? I kind of feel like the improved fidelity of having these really great LCR speakers might more than make up for the incidental sounds of surround sound speakers, and I could always add a pair (or two) later if I miss 5.1 or 7.1. 

Thanks for any thoughts. :)"

How to get complete payment refund after denying delivery due to car defects?,CarsIndia,1hkv3l0,2024-12-23 14:17:16,3,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1hkv3l0/how_to_get_complete_payment_refund_after_denying/,cooldude234t,#Query ❓,"I had booked Baleno zeta variant gray colour from nexa dealership on 16 dec. They already had the car in their stockyard. The salesman brought the car to showroom on 18 dec 2024, and hurriedly gave us overview of the car and i checked the car in a dim lit environment(as showroom was about to close at that time). All seemed well, and so i arranged money for complete payment(no financing was done).  and called the salesman on 19 december to ready the car with free of cost accessories as promised by him, and call me only when the car is ready(i reached around 5pm after work and showroom closing time is around 7pm). Salesman called me on 20 december around 1 pm that my car is ready and i can come whenever i want). I went there on the same day evening. When i reached there, the car was not ready for delivery, and i waited for another 2 hrs till closing of the showroom, and on near the closing time, the salesman came hurriedly to me to get my insurance done, which i did readily, as i thought it would save time, and after few minutes, salesman came to inform that the accessories were not there, and you have to take the car now because showroom was about to close(the car just came from washing at closing time, and i hadn't seen the car while completing insurance formalities as it was gone for washing). I argued why you made us wait for 2 hours, only to tell to get my accessories fitted some other time, that was a total time wastage for me. I said that i won't take the delivery unless you completely ready my car. I didn't check the car while going out of the showroom. The next day, showroom was closed due to municipal elections, and the salesman told me that he will ready the car on sunday(22 december) for delivery and everything will be done as fast as possible. I went there on sunday, car was ready with cover put on it for ribbon cutting. After the cover was lifted, i could see in broad daylight that 3 dents, and multiple scratches were there on front bumper and on both sides of the car(and one scratch went from the underside of rear door handle till the petrol tank, and the paint of ~2x2 cm was removed in the middle of that scratch). I immediately asked them to give me replacement, and they denied it, and pushed me to take white colour, or some other variant of the car. Being furious with such a bad service, i immediately sought for either replacement or refund. They denied replacement due to unavailability, so i denied taking delivery and filled the form for refund and gave them my bank details. They assured me that they would send the cheque to my bank next day, and i will recieve my whole amount of 9 lakhs day after tomorrow.

 They called me today, not to tell me the status of refund, but to manipulate me into waiting for same variant and colour which would come around 30-31 dec, but i thought it might be their trick to block my money till the december offer is over, because the prices will increase tremendously in January, and this would prevent me from buying car from another dealership this month only.(i booked same variant and colour from another dealership on the same day when i denied the delivery from another dealership, and it is due for delivery on 27 dec). I called the salesman to put the cheque in bank by 2 pm, otherwise i will approach customer care, to which salesman said that i was free to do so. So, recieving no response by 5pm, i filed a complaint in maruti suzuki customer care, and i got a call from salesman after 15 mins, that why did i do so, to which i replied that you people were doing nothing to help me, and were using delay tactics. Only after complaint he sent me a poorly worded whatsapp message that they will not refund me the insurance amount(the insurance amount was 26.5K from icici lombard, through maruti suzuki insurance only). I called the maruti suzuki insurance and they said i will get only around 10k because third party insurance is not refundable and this refund is only for Own damage insurance. 

My friends were telling me that the way salesman was interacting with me, and the way they tried to sell the car to me, it seemed that they already knew about scratches and dents, and were trying to sell me that car for the price of a new car.

Summary- The dealer tried to sell me car with dents and scratches, who should bear these cancellation charges for insurance, will it fall upon me or should dealer itself bear it? 

And what should i do to get my complete refund from them as quickly as possible? 

thanks in advance for any help


Edit: Update-  i put up a complaint against the agency through customer care of maruti suzuki, and it works! 

I got my refund of the whole amount(except insurance fees) within 2 days of filing complaint. And the agency was trying to get me to sign the satisfaction note after giving me a cheque of 8.73 lakhs to close the complaint. I didn't sign it and argued that i will only be satisfied if i receive the complete refund of insurance fees, and if there are any cancellation charges, the agency will itself will bear it. They were hesitant on bearing the cancellation fees, so i went out from agency without signing that document. 2-3 days later, this complaint reached to regional sales manager, and he took me on conference call and told agency either to find a way, so that i get complete refund of insurance fees or bear that cancellation charges. After a while, i get a call from agency that i will be refunded complete amount. This took a while, and some effort, but it happened. 

Recently, i recieved the whole insurance fees(not even a single rupee was cut for cancelling it) after a month.

In short, the customer won this time. The agency tried its best with its shady practices, but had to do the needful at the last.

The agency was nexa swani motors, near trillium mall amritsar

And not only this one, the practices of the only other nexa showroom in amritsar are same. I can't say about other nexa showrooms in the region. So, stay vigilant.

BF put his hands on me for the first time - need advice,gaybros,1he0izj,2024-12-14 05:52:51,758,0.97,277,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1he0izj/bf_put_his_hands_on_me_for_the_first_time_need/,JBionic,,"Hey bros,

tl;dr: Am I wrong for ending a relationship after my boyfriend put his hands on me?

I was dating dating my bf for the last 18 months or so, going pretty solid, moved in together & 6 months later even relocated cross-country so that a new job wouldn't interrupt our relationship. We've had our share of arguments since we moved to CA in January, most of which were caused by me spending too much time playing video games -- which I decided to end about 6 weeks ago. Since making this change, we haven't had any serious arguments, we've started doing more together, we've become more intimate, and genuinely I've felt our relationship reaching a new level of awesome.

Until tonight. Before getting ready for bed, we got into an argument about the ribbon on the Christmas tree. I attempted to bring attention to the ridiculousness of the argument source and suggested it's not worth our time or energy, and he wasn't letting it go. I forget what was said in the moment, by him, and then my response, but then he came at me and put his hand around my throat. I guess I didn't really expect he would ever do that, so I wasn't preparing any defense, but then I managed to push his arms away and tell him ""absolutely not, we don't do that"". He came at me again, tried again, and I managed to push him away again, all the while I was telling him no, that this isn't who he is, that he's supposed to be better than this. (Some context, I'm 6'4"" 250lbs, he's 5'11"" 160lbs)

After the second time, he backed off and went to sit on the couch, seemingly realizing that he fucked up. I questioned what got into him to get physical, suggested that he leave & go anywhere but here. A few minutes later after I thought about it more, I told him he crossed a line that he can't uncross, that we're done, and that we can make sure our finances are balanced but that one of us needs to find a new place. He didn't show any remorse for his actions and instead said it's my fault for making him so angry.

I love this guy more than I've loved someone before, but I've also seen enough domestic abuse PSAs to know that this is unacceptable on his part. I think it's normal make mistakes, occasionally go too far in an argument, but I feel this is actually a line that can't be uncrossed. Am I overreacting? Am I wrong for ending things & planning to immediately separate after one incident?


**UPDATE** - Last night I slept in the primary bedroom with my dog & locked the door. He slept on the couch because he refused to leave after I asked him. I did not feel any threat of physical danger after the initial event, which is the only reason I was willing to stay here physically. I also followed many of your advice and told a friend what happened, as well as a family member. (Both to hold me accountable for moving forward with the breakup and in the event of any further escalation). He still hasn't acknowledged his actions were wrong and continues to say that I was a bad partner & that my words incited his behavior. (to his credit, this may have some truth - but still not worthy of physical aggression)

I've contacted the apartment manager and now know the steps to revise the lease. I've agreed with my ex that we'll take my name off the lease and I'll aim to move out with my dog ASAP, and I've even toured a new apartment in the same community.

I do not feel any immediate threat of further physical aggression and I genuinely still love this guy, but the trust and safety required for a continued and healthy relationship is gone. For the sake of logistics, it'll take a couple of weeks to make sure we've balanced all of our finances, detangle our possessions, and fully separate. He and my dog have a really strong bond (I think she actually likes him more than she likes me), so I'm also remaining open to keeping in touch with him as I don't want either of them to lose that love."
Totoo bang hindi nabautismuhan ang asawa ni Ka Felix Manalo? ,TrueIglesiaNiCristo,1hdxarg,2024-12-14 01:58:09,0,0.48,1,https://i.redd.it/ylod6swhir6e1.jpeg,James_Readme,📰 Article,"𝐓𝐎𝐓𝐎𝐎 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐆 𝐇𝐈𝐍𝐃𝐈 𝐍𝐀𝐁𝐀𝐔𝐓𝐈𝐒𝐌𝐔𝐇𝐀𝐍 𝐀𝐍𝐆 𝐀𝐒𝐀𝐖𝐀 𝐍𝐈 𝐊𝐀 𝐅𝐄𝐋𝐈𝐗 𝐌𝐀𝐍𝐀𝐋𝐎?

Ayon sa fake news na ipinapakalat ni Sebastian Rauffenburg ay kabilang sa hindi nabautismuhan ang asawa ni Ka Felix Manalo na si Ka Honorata de Guzman-Manalo.

Ang basehan niya?

Dahil lang hindi na isinama sa listahan ang kaniyang pangalan sa mga binautismuhan bilang pinakaunang mga converts na mababasa sa lumang Pasugo article. Ininterpret niya na agad na hindi talaga nabautismuhan si Ka Honorata.

Ngunit malinaw sa Pasugo June 2014 na kasama siya sa mga unang nabautismuhan ni Ka Felix Manalo at isa sa mga pioneer members ng INC.

Kaya ang magiging response panigurado ni Sebastian ay iikot lang sa kesyo iniba ang istorya at nagsisinungaling ang INC sa bagay na ito. Tulad ng mga luma niyang argumento, malamang ang sasabihin niya ay kesyo kung totoong nabautismuhan si Ka Ata bat di sinama ang pangalan niya? Basang basa ko na kung paano siya mag isip 🤭

Iyon ang problema sa anti INCs, sa halip gumawa ng malalimang research ay imimisinterpret nila ang mga impormasyon upang gawing paninira sa Iglesia. Ang ending, sila ang nag-aakusa pero sila ang manghihingi ng ebidensiya. Lagi nating tatandaan na ang burden of proof ay nasa accuser at hindi nasa accused. Patunayan nilang direktang sinabi sa kahit anong mahahanap nilang sources na HINDI SIYA NABAUTISMUHAN SA INC. 

Sa kaso nga ni Ka Felix Manalo ay hindi naman itinanggi ng INC na hindi siya nabautismuhan at hindi siya inordenahan ng kung sino na mababasa mismo sa pasugo:

Wharton vs. Kellogg vs. Tuck vs. Darden | Decision Help,MBA,1hdoo1i,2024-12-13 17:54:24,0,0.5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1hdoo1i/wharton_vs_kellogg_vs_tuck_vs_darden_decision_help/,infoseeker54,Admissions,"I’m incredibly grateful to have gotten into some great schools in R1. Honestly didn’t expect to have so many options and I’m now having a hard time making a decision between prestige, career opportunities, potential cost, and where I would see myself being the happiest. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. 

Background: I’m a 30 year old male veteran w/ 8 years of military experience. My wife and I just got married so making sure the program is partner friendly is a major priority. We are both very social and like to party/want to make life long friends at B school but also want a place where we have the option to start a family during our second year. We also have a crazy 2 year old golden retriever. My wife works remote but has to travel pretty often so proximity to an airport needs to be considered but isn’t a non-negotiable. Post MBA goal is MBB Strategy consulting. We are open to living in many different areas on the East coast (Mid Atlantic, Northeast, South)- not set on one particular geographic location.

-Wharton (no scholarship): 

Pros: most prestigious school with most robust alumni network (is this too good of an opportunity to walk away from?); can go into any industry including consulting but also opens doors for non traditional opportunities down the road- also gives me the option to pivot to other careers (finance) if I decide I don’t want to pursue consulting; love Philly and have a lot of family in the city but might be a little tougher living in the city with our dog; plenty of fun stuff to do and lots of great food with access to an airport; central to all East coast cities we would consider living in post MBA

Cons: most expensive (after GI Bill/Yellow Ribbon would owe approx $15K a year in tuition and fees so would have to take out loans); largest class size- not sure if this is particularly a con but initially was looking at a very close knit/tight community which I feel comes from a small class size; not sure how partner friendly it is

-Kellogg ($10K scholarship over the 2 years): 

Pros: M7- great school with incredible name recognition and alumni network, probably places the best into MBB; Evanston seems like a great college town with community feel and gives you the flexibility to travel to the city and access to airport being about 45 mins outside Chicago; have been told it’s very partner friendly; one of my best friends is a first year there so we’d overlap for a year; less expensive than Wharton (after GI Bill/Yellow Ribbon/scholarship would owe a little over $8K a year in tuition and fees)

Cons: Not sure how I feel about living in the Midwest/dealing with the Chicago winters, places well in Midwest/Chicago- not a spot my wife and I initially saw ourselves living long term post MBA; program that I know the least about 

-Tuck (no scholarship):

Pros: T-10- great school with Ivy League name recognition that places very well in consulting; seems to be the most responsive alumni network that will drop everything to help; SUPER partner friendly and probably the best school for a married couple; visited campus a few times and felt like it was the school I connected the most to- so welcoming and made my wife and I feel like we were a part of the community before even being admitted. Also loved how close knit the students were and the faculty really makes the effort to make you feel like you’re more than just a number to them; very small price tag (after GI Bill/Yellow Ribbon would owe about $5.5K a year in student fees); places well in Boston, a spot we’d consider living post MBA

Cons: Not quite as prestigious as Wharton or Kellogg, far away from family; very cold weather; in the woods/isolated (I think this is both a positive and a negative because the isolated geography seems to be what makes the class super close but worried we’d get bored after 2 years in a place where there isn’t much to do)

-Darden (half-tuition scholarship- $84k over the 2 years): 

Pros: GI Bill covers full tuition so the $84K scholarship would be supplemental income (which would be very helpful considering we’re going from two paychecks down to one); places very well in consulting; we love Charlottesville- small town remote feel with more things to do than Hanover if we went to Tuck, very partner friendly, close knit/tight community- most similar to the vibe that I got from Tuck; places very well in DC, a spot we’d consider living post MBA

Cons: Still a great school but not as good as the others; not near major airport, case method/hard academically (this could be both a pro and a con- case method is probably a major reason why Darden places so well in consulting but have also heard that it can be hard juggling academics, social life, and recruiting especially during the first term)

**Chapter 323: Going Forwards, Backwards**

Liliane Harten's mini-arc. 2/4.

\*\*\*

“\[Blade Guardian\].”

The uneven walls of an abandoned mining shaft briefly flashed to life as an ethereal greatsword floated beside Liliane. Her only companion, along with her \[Lantern Wisp\] lighting up the distance. 

They were all that she needed. For now.

The ground was her only concern. Littered with a carpet of shards hewn with either nails or teeth, they were the greatest threat to her life should she stumble in this abandoned silver mine–or at least more than the giant rats, the flame beetles or the fruit slimes fleeing from the shepherds in the forest outside.

With its entrance a stone’s throw from the nearest flock of lamb, Liliane couldn’t believe that the farmer outside the guild hall had been understating the goblin presence. 

This was as bold as she ever knew goblins to be.

Unlike some of her peers, Liliane had never run afoul of goblins. They were not necessarily courteous, but they kept to their own affairs, often at a considerable distance.

However, if the lord and lady of Marinsgarde realised they’d inhabited a mine so close to the town, they’d be well within their rights to order their eviction. 

With a show of steel, if need be.  

Liliane was more than happy to prevent that from happening. 

She might not be a regular at the sewing houses, but she’d chosen Marinsgarde as her home for a reason. The streets were sometimes tidy, the sewers were semi-functional and the croissants she received from the nice lady next door were always warm. And free. That made it better than every other town.

Having it the site of history’s most recent bloody dispute wasn’t what she needed.

Nor, it seemed, somebody else.

Her eyes looked over the carcasses as her boots sought to avoid them.

The fruit slimes had been left alone, but the rest of the forest refugees had been efficiently disposed of. Most had the clear markings of goblins, which is to say they’d been bludgeoned, examined for edibility and then bludgeoned again. 

Some of them, however, were the result of being cleanly severed. 

She’d seen such bladework often. It was no serrated knife or hooked scimitar which caused the flame beetles to be divided in two while leaving their potentially exploding sacs undisturbed.

It was a swordsman. One with impressive technique.

Liliane was not alone in investigating the goblin presence. Given the location was far from the road, a forest ranger was the most likely culprit, although it was possible a frustrated guard captain had decided to take matters into their own hands. 

Following her \[Lantern Wisp\] in the distance, Liliane increased the briskness of her pace.

Before long, she already found herself huffing as she ambled along. The memories, even nostalgia, of traversing old mines dribbled across the forefront of her mind. But while the unevenness of her steps was familiar, the fatigue was not. 

Liliane quietly chastised herself.

It’d been a while since she’d trekked away from the road. It’d been longer since she did it alone. 

But here so close to Maringarde, she expected few threats–*particularly* since goblins were involved. 

The farmers rightfully despaired at their pots and pans disappearing in the middle of the night, but when it came to the heart of it, goblins enjoyed not warring with humans. And as an A-rank adventurer, Liliane boasted more protection than a diplomat. 

All the more since a magical greatsword was floating beside her.

She paused as she joined her \[Lantern Wisp\]. 

The mining shaft continued, but a new doorway had been hewn to the side. Or perhaps smashed. She could almost perfectly draw the silhouette of a hobgoblin headbutting their way through. And if there was something valuable to be had on the other side, she’d favour a hobgoblin’s forehead over a mountain on the majority of occasions.

Disregarding the rest of the mine, she stepped through the gap. 

The air changed at once. 

It was less open. More hostile. 

Gone were the wooden supports and the emptied lanterns on the walls. But Liliane didn’t slow her steps. Whatever else once resided here, the worst had been cleared long before any curious wanderers could do away with the lesser ones. 

It was a commission the guild’s rookies should have taken. While it was easier to stab things and be done with it, to hand in scraps of wolf pelts and unidentifiable teeth was a slow way to climb any ladder.

Reclaiming lost wealth, on the other hand, was the fastest of them all.

Liliane already had her suspicions. 

She’d seen this before, once in Rozinthe and twice in the Dunes. An unexcavated gold vein and chambers still filled with treasure. Goblins didn’t operate so close to major settlements without reason. Their noses rarely indulged in.

The farmer had it right. 

They weren’t here to stay, but to find something. And given the mine’s proximity to Marinsgarde, it was very likely something the town would want as well. 

… Antagonising goblins, then. 

They’d complain, stamp their feet and bristle like porcupines. But they knew as well as the farmers did that these mines weren’t theirs. And no matter what they hoped to find, it was not worth the cost of denying a guild representative.

*BrrrMmmmMmmMmmmMm*.

Thus, as a rumble swept past her ankles, she wondered if it was worth the cost of finding it at all.

Liliane stopped as she listened to the sounds.

It was more than the shaking of the ground which echoed down the newly rounded tunnels. There was a commotion. One as familiar to any adventurer’s ears as a hearthfire crackling in a guild hall. 

A battle.

Swords bashing against armour. Shields splintering in two. Arrows whistling in the air. 

The goblins had done more than hewn a new path through the mines.

Liliane frowned. 

The noise echoed, painting a blurry picture of chaos in the distance. They were either celebrating a birthday or fighting something they’d managed to disturb. Given that it’d be something which had slept through a century of pickaxes stripping the hillside bare, she very much hoped it was ribbons and picnic tables she found ahead.

A small voice of caution appeared in the back of Liliane’s mind.

She continued regardless.

It was often said that the best adventurers possessed a sense for danger. But then they wouldn’t be adventurers, they’d be accountants. It was, after all, a profession stained with over a thousand years of blood, most of it lost in the bowels of horrors which had no names.

No … it wasn’t danger the very best had a sense for. 

It was for being in the right place at the right time.

“\[Ethereal Owl\].”

Her curiosity piqued, she conjured a second guide as the tunnels split ahead. An owl formed of transparent jade appeared by her side, revealing the beautiful gemstones painting the walls. 

… Beautiful gemstones which shouldn’t exist without having long been plucked.

Liliane moved as the glittering on the walls did.

Stepping back, all she saw of the jewel spider bursting forth was the first of its chitinous legs. Each was the length of a dagger and considerably sharper.

The next moment, she witnessed the sight of a glimmering carapace divided in half. 

Her \[Blade Guardian\] swept as elegantly as a feather quill. As the jewel spider dropped to the ground, both halves *shattered* into a tiny scattering of the gemstones which covered it.

Liliane didn’t celebrate.

“\[Arcane Fist\].”

Four jewel spiders burst forth from all directions. 

One was met by a swipe of her greatsword, pulverising a second as both were swept back into the wall. The third was snipped in half as the talons of her conjured owl separated it at the neck. As the fourth lunged for Liliane’s back, it was grasped by the abdomen, its bladed legs swiping furiously as the magical fist squeezed … until eventually, nothing but a dusting of gemstones tinkled onto the ground. 

Still, Liliane didn’t pause.

She directed her \[Blade Guardian\] with a fingertip, carving through the walls around her. The jewel spiders remaining in ambush for her to scoop up her rewards became nothing but glitter themselves. 

Her owl circled around her, lighting up the remainder of the tunnel.

No more faux gemstones waited. And for a moment, Liliane’s thoughts turned to surprise at seeing jewel spiders allowed to inhabit the entrance of the goblin tunnels. To a compendium of monsters, they were D-rank adversaries. But to those who had fought them, they were significantly more dangerous.

After all–

Their ambushes never ceased.

As the light from her conjured owl darkened, she looked up to see the gap in the ceiling. 

It was a sight to send children bawling. An entire balled cluster of jewel spiders tightly interwoven as they silently spun down towards her, dozens of eyes peering in all directions like a concentrated abomination of arachnophobia. 

All their eyes met hers. 

The cluster suddenly fell. Her conjured creations swept up as her hands light up with her next spell.

“*Blazing Adjudicator Form, 3rd Stance ...* \[Abyssal Divide\]!”

Liliane never had the chance to cast it.

A figure swept past in a mirage of movement, sword trailing overhead to cleave the cluster as though it were a single entity. It might as well have been. As Liliane swiftly moved to the side, she saw each and every jewel spider individually sliced into two.

It was all the admiration she offered.

Sweeping around at once, she directed her array of conjured weaponry at the swordsman.

He already had his hands up, the sword he’d used to impressive effect already sheathed. 

The easy smile he wore suggested this was a familiar scene.

“Woah there,” he said, his tone as easy as a patron behind a bar counter. “Coin pouch by my left hip. Take everything I have. It’s not much I’m afraid. But it’s all yours.”

Liliane didn’t relax. Lone swordsmen in the wild did that to her.

Especially when it was clear he was neither a ranger nor a guard.

A young man whose unshaven face was the tidiest part of him. Both his cloak and his leather armour were so well-travelled that whatever colour they once were was lost. Only the hilt of his sword showed any signs of care. Liliane didn’t concern herself with the sewing houses of Marinsgarde, but she knew immediately this man was already barred from stepping foot into each one.

She frowned. 

“This is an abandoned mine. Who are you?”

“Just someone wondering why I wasn’t born a mage. A fist, a sword and an owl? I reckon I could do half my chores with them three.”

The fist, sword and owl hovered closer to the man.

He gave a small cough.

“*Ahem* … Caban Oxwell’s the name. Wandering miscreant and adventurer both. Pleased to meet you.”

Liliane’s eyes snapped towards his finger.

She groaned at once, dispersing the greatsword when she detected the magic resonating with its wielder.

… She kept both the owl and the fist.

Of course. Nothing was more typical than an adventurer going into a pit. Just like her. 

Liliane had no room for complaint. There wasn’t a single sign saying this was goblin territory. And even if there were, it wouldn’t stop them.

“… Liliane Harten,” she replied, before letting out a sigh.

The young man … Caban Oxwell, gave an appreciative nod as he slowly allowed his hands to fall.

His eyes took far too long to glance down in turn.

“Liliane Harten? … Wait, would you be the A-rank adventurer?”

“I am, yes.” 

The man blinked.

And then–he simply gave a relaxed laugh before feigning a look of defeat.

“Damn, there goes me looking impressive, huh? And I thought that was my best chance. Well, as for myself, I’m just a humble C-rank.”

Liliane was more shocked than by any amount of jewel spiders.

There wasn’t a hint of the usual speechlessness from this man … and he was a C-rank? 

More than ever, Liliane felt the gulf widening between her and the Snow Dancer. She had no doubt that this man would be on his hands and knees if he saw her.

“... Uh, you okay there?”

“I’m fine, yes,” said Liliane, not fine at all. “... What are you doing here, Mr. Oxwell?”

“Just Caban will do. And I’m here for a calico. Seen one around?”

“A what?”

“A calico. The name’s Pepper. Told he’s a bit tubby. Orange, black and white. Girl from the nearby village lost him.”

Suddenly, Liliane had to stop herself from snorting.

A C-rank adventurer. And he was wandering into abandoned mines looking for a cat. Perhaps he was the rising star they were all talking about.

“No, I haven’t.” 

“Ah, shame. I tracked the prints somewhere nearby. Figured he might’ve slinked here.”

“That’s unlikely. Cats are good at avoiding things which can eat them.”

“Like jewel spiders where they shouldn’t be?”

“Yes … I think the goblins might be in a hurry.”

Caban nodded while feigning a look of surprise–as though he didn’t know what the distinctly goblin-like sounds nearby were 

“... Goblins. So that’s what it is. You’re right. They usually do a better job at keeping their tunnels tidy. Know a few myself. Not good talkers. But good drinkers. Guessing that’s why you’re here?”

“I’m investigating a report by a local farmer. They’re concerned for their flock.”

“Still helping the little guys, huh? Now that’s an A-rank adventurer I can look up to. In that case, it looks like we’re heading the same direction.”

The man raised his palms before Liliane could reject him.

“Hey, no need to look out for me. I’m good at running. But I’d rather not do it until I’ve a reason to. It sounds like the goblins are fighting something fierce. If Pepper’s over there, he might be in trouble.”

Liliane very nearly sighed.

This man. He was *that* type of adventurer.

For a moment, she considered outright declining. 

Whatever was occurring, it involved goblins neglecting their own tunnels. They weren't just bold. They were reckless. She needed to investigate this, and in her experience, an overly enthusiastic adventurer was a liability. Especially if they sought to impress their peers. 

Even so, if she looked far … far past the state of his armour, his swordsmanship was unusually keen. And being a C-rank meant he was still above what the majority of the guild boasted.

… But most of all, she already knew that ‘no’ meant something different to this brand of adventurer.

“My conjurations will guide the way,” said Liliane, gesturing at him to follow. “But we’ll need to walk carefully. The tunnels will be varied. Some might be trapped. Others certainly have monsters.”

“It’s fine. I can tell which way we need to go.”

“Oh? How so, exactly?”

“It’s hard to explain. But my master taught me how. Basically, I’ve a pretty good sense for directions. Well, other than when I need to use the restroom.”

Liliane hesitated.

That … was not a technique she had ever heard about.

“And who is your master, exactly … ?”

“Thomas Lainsfont.”

Then, she promptly stumbled.

Catching herself before she struck the glittering remains of the jewel spiders, she turned to look at the C-rank adventurer with shock. As he gave an awkward smile back, she now realised she could practically see the image of Thomas Lainsfont just from the way he stood.

That was the effect the leader of the Golden Hogs had.

“... I see.” Liliane nodded, understanding now how a C-rank could come to learn such a high level sword technique. “I didn’t know he took apprentices.”

“He doesn’t. Officially I was just a nuisance.” Caban gave a short laugh, his eyes briefly alight with memory before deliberately turning towards the tunnels. “By the way, did you know–”

“I know he has a bar, yes.”

“Hm? No, not that.”

“Oh. Sorry. What were you saying?”

“Well, I was going to ask if you knew that the goblins are coming towards us. Did you still want to head on over?”

Liliane blinked.

She then sent both her \[Lantern Wisp\] and her \[Ethereal Owl\] ahead, her eyes narrowing as both sets of tunnels lit up.

Not long after, she found out which one had been the correct answer.

Both of them.

They were equally filled with goblins. 

More than she’d ever seen packed together in her life. 

Without so much as a glance in their direction, they both joined together like two streams forming a river. Goblins, hobgoblins and even trained wolves rushed past the two adventurers as a haze of scrappy armour, fluffy fur and wrinkled noses, before squeezing into the tunnel behind them.

A moment later, the light from both a \[Lantern Wisp\] and \[Ethereal Owl\] simultaneously extinguished.

And then–

The fleeing goblins were promptly joined by a pair of adventurers.

however I was wondering if this looks good for internships, specifically the work experience part, should I need to work in another retail part time job or fast food? (For context this job is part of my fathers business hence why I am wondering) alternatively, one of the soon to be former Vice Presidents said I should run for vice president for the Finance Student Organization

I could run for it but I am not sure if I can juggle that and a part time job and my homework (I have ADHD I already spend a lot of time on my homework as it is), would the part time job be of a great benefit? Or is it just a marginal benefit in comparison?

Other improvements to the resume would be appreciated too, thanks "

**Chapter 322: The Other A-Rank**

Liliane Harten's mini-arc. 1/4.

\*\*\*

Liliane snipped the ribbon.

“... I hereby declare *The Rambling Mermaid* now open!”

Cheers filled the air as the door to Marinsgarde’s latest prized asset was flung open.

A bar.

It hadn’t poured its first Granholtz Sunrise and already it was worse than all its competitors. An honour it was unlikely to surpass. 

The street around it was so seedy even the rats avoided it–as well as most of the townspeople. As much as Marinsgarde was famous for its sewing rooms nobody could afford to browse, it was still a town with all its pock marks and scars … even if few people ever saw this side of it.

And that’s why Liliane was here.

Customers who were already drunk from the bar just next door streamed past to enjoy the opening day happy hour which would last all the way until the bar permanently closed. Of them, only a handful offered their earnest, if drowsy nods as they filed through.

After all, dressed in a barmaid’s uniform, there was little to distinguish Liliane Harten from the rest.

All except for one small thing.

A copper ring upon her finger. And perhaps also her twitching smile.

She pursed her lips as the customers streamed past, all the while she held her breath with more skill than a pirate diving for treasure. She’d endured every odour between the hells and the sun, and half of them were from the ones who’d just passed her. 

It was hardly a surprise, then, when the owner now decided to hobble out.

He wiped the sweat from his brow, then did the same for the sweat on his neck. All the effort it’d taken to pour one round of drinks. And going by the redness of his ears, all of them went to him.

“... A most auspicious start!” he said, merrily waving in the rest of his customers. Even the ones who were just trying to quickly walk past. “And all due to you, I wager. Thank you for agreeing to my request, Miss Harten. To have an A-rank adventurer opening my store is an *honour*.”

Liliane’s smile returned. 

Her twitching, shaking smile.

“The honour’s mine,” she replied. “It’s the duty of all adventurers to ensure they’re involved in all facets of the community which supports them. To be invited to take part in the opening of a new business fills me with joy. Marinsgarde is my home, after all.”

“And how lucky we are to have you.” The barkeeper moved to clap her shoulders. Liliane moved slightly away. “Our very own A-rank adventurer, too! … Hah, and they say Reitzlake is bigger. Well, not big enough to have you.”

“Ah, well, I wouldn’t quite say that …”

“It’s not bad over there, of course. But it’s not here, either. And to think I almost ended up there.”

“... Your bar?”

“No, not my bar. Me. I actually considered being an adventurer in my youth too, you know.”

Liliane considered the sweat crinkling the man’s collar.

“I’m certain you still can. With your Ogre Rum Sour, you could rise to the very top.”

The barkeeper gave a hearty laugh. 

Liliane didn’t join him. It was the truth. She’d seen adventurers come and go, usually into the jaws of a sand wyrm, but whoever manned the bar only went upwards.

More than once, she regretted her life choices.

“Well, I won’t deny I let the dream float by every now and again,” said the barkeeper, leaning back to a crack of his spine. “But I’m too old for that now. Besides, this kingdom has enough A-ranks as it is. I reckon we’re good with the three of you now, don’t you think?”

Liliane paused, the smile fading for only a moment. 

“... Yes, although our lives are separate, the paths we walk are the same.” 

“Rightly said! Your peers abroad could learn about that, too. Given what I hear other adventurers get up to elsewhere, I’m shocked your halls don’t become fighting pits every night.”

They did become fighting pits every night.

It’s how any of them slept. Marinsgarde was an exception. It’s why she chose it.

“I can’t speak on behalf of my peers. I’ve little knowledge of what occurs outside the kingdom.”

“Probably for the best. I should stop reading *The Reitzlake Times*. Violent world out there. Makes you thankful for what we have. Like my bar for instance. Beautiful, no?”

“Yes it is,” said Liliane, looking at a dead rat against the wall.

The barkeeper nodded. Also at the same dead rat.

“... A shame Mr. Lainsfont retired, isn’t it? I would’ve liked him to visit once more. Just not for another calamity. I actually bought this bar partly because of him. Did you know he opened his own?”

Liliane did know.

She knew because each time Thomas Lainsfont was mentioned, they spoke about the sadness of his retirement and the curiosity which was his bar. All the time. Without fail.

“Really? I didn’t know.” 

“It’s quite popular, although I haven’t had the chance to visit myself. Ah, but don’t you start getting ideas. I’ve good reason to consider mine already superior, given the good fortune of you opening it.”

“Of course.” Liliane smiled. And then she held out a palm. “Incidentally, the matter of my fee is–”

“Actually, speaking of the A-ranks … you wouldn’t happen to know if the Snow Dancer is around, would you?”

*Crack*.

Liliane’s knuckles made an odd sound as her fists clenched.

“The Snow Dancer? … Ah, Ophelia. I’m afraid I wouldn’t know where she is.”

The barkeeper glanced down at the sound in confusion, before breaking into an oblivious smile. 

“I … I see. That’s a pity. I would’ve liked to have her visit my bar.”

*Crack*.

“... Uh, but not because I’m a fan of the Snow Dancer or secretly hoped you knew she was nearby or anything. It’s just that, well, my daughter has a plushie of her. You know, the ones they sell in the market.”

“I know of them, yes.”

Liliane held up her palm and smiled. 

The barkeeper coughed as he sheepishly deposited a small pouch of coins.

“... Thank you again for helping to open my new bar today, Miss Harten.”

“You’re welcome.”

Liliane nodded. 

And then she was gone with a sweep of her auburn hair.

Ignoring the wish to tug at her barmaid’s uniform, she began heading back to the guild hall where her accommodation waited. But not immediately. 

Instead, she adopted her smile once again as she deliberately opted for the busiest route back. 

Barely two corners away from where the dead rat lay, her footsteps took her past colourful storefronts, each window boasting wares as strange as they were unpronounceable.

Liliane’s eyes weren’t upon them, but rather on the visitors jostling to decide what they couldn’t buy. 

As usual, few stopped to glance at her, other than to raise a brow at the barmaid uniform she wore. And for a moment, the smile vanished from Liliane’s face as a now familiar disappointment ran through her.

She was the resident A-rank adventurer. A feat achieved by so few that it was enough to have a statue built of them in their home village, bankrupting every resident in the process. 

She knew. It’s what happened to hers, after all. 

But Marinsgarde was different. As was its constant influx of visitors. Lissoine boasted more than A-ranks. They had a fleet which was the envy of the world and their own brand of elite knights. Chevaliers who apparently grew petals from their hair. 

Even if they bothered learning who she was, she still would have lost out against the first window. 

And yet that lethargy was also shared by the residents. Any novelty at her presence had been lost approximately the night after her arrival. And the reason was simple.

Liliane Harten … was the *other* A-rank.

That was only natural. Anyone compared to Thomas Lainsfont would be. The man had practically swashbuckled his way to the top, leading his Golden Hogs down this very promenade with a very stabbed basilisk tied behind them. 

He’d been granted an audience with royalty for that. And then he’d retired before they could promote him just so he wouldn’t accidentally bankrupt every village to have hosted him. 

That sealed his legacy more than any rotting carcasses ever could. 

He was the poster boy of adventuring before she’d even frightened away her first fruit slime. And so despite sharing the same rank, Liliane knew she could hardly compare. 

She had precious few stories of personal heroism, after all.

She had even fewer of charity. 

Not because she was a worse adventurer … but because she was a perfectly normal one.

There were only two types of adventurers. Those who joined the guild for fame and fortune and those who lied about not joining for fame and fortune. Beyond the smiling receptionists and the cats publicly hoisted away from their favourite trees, it was an organisation like any other. 

The guild code was a towel to wipe away the blemishes. 

In adventuring, just as in life, there was politics, there was deceit, and there was blood. 

Just not Liliane’s.

She’d progressed through the time honoured tradition of connections, hopping from one acclaimed adventuring team to the next. 

She was there, somewhere in the back, when Sir Rethan the Vaunted slew a demonic blood fiend by grasping its heart into a thousand messy pieces. She was there when Hinora the Blue Mage used a sword of ice to melt the flames of a phoenix. And she was there when two clans of ordinary barbarians had a drinking contest in a Granholtz tavern.

That one was the worst. 

But for her good sense to not overstay her welcome, she’d returned a bona fide A-rank adventurer.

That was, as far as she knew, the traditional way to climb the Oldest Ladder.

Luck. Opportunism. Connections. The ability to shout very loudly. And every now and again, the occasional spell tossed into some nameless thing’s maw.

… And then there was Ophelia.

Liliane made her way down the main street, her brisk steps fuelled by a cocktail of disbelief and personal dissatisfaction at the hopeless unfairness which was a beautiful elven sword saint.

The Snow Dancer was a swirling tornado of carnage. But she was also prettier than her. She was more accomplished than her. And she … well, she probably wasn’t younger than her. 

Liliane had no idea how old she was, but for all she knew, she likely had 27 grandchildren by now. 

Elven skin was absurd. And if she had one memory she wished to erase, it was the day she was invited to give a speech while sitting beside that woman and her ducks. There were 200 dignitaries in Duke Valence’s court, and all of them were watching Ophelia scribbling her name into the table while waiting for the free buffet to begin.

But in the end, Liliane only had herself to blame.

She’d grown comfortable.

No, worse … she’d become apathetic. The reflection of the barmaid uniform was proof of that. 

Without realising it, she’d been forgotten in her own town. And as her final punishment, now it was more than the Snow Dancer who wished to overshadow her.

As she walked towards the guild hall, she listened to snatches of conversation. 

To whispers and gossip traded as idly as coins, their bearers never once realising that words were worth so much more. Again, there was nothing regarding the rising star she’d heard about. An adventurer who’d seemingly dropped from a stork and climbed the lower ranks in a heartbeat.

Not even Guildmaster Triniard could explain who she was. Nobody could. 

All either of them knew was that she was one of Timon Quinsley’s flock. And that made the sudden rise all the stranger. Everyone knew that man was not above his tricks. But he was also pragmatic and honourable … at least in his own way. 

To simply hurl his own adventurers up the Oldest Ladder was not how he worked.

There were always rising stars, of course. Liliane had seen them fall as swiftly as they rose, crushed by the fabled wall of limits that all adventurers eventually came to meet. But now the whispers were more erratic. More confused.

Liliane sucked in a deep breath as she walked.

She had to act, or else it’d be more than her plushies which were swept from the windows.

Luckily, there was a simple solution–and that was to continue where she’d left off.

She needed to climb the Oldest Ladder, just one more time. 

Liliane Harten needed to rise to S-rank … somehow. 

It was something which would take more than connections to achieve. She needed to do something that Timon Quinsley … that headquarters themselves could not ignore.

The very things that Thomas Lainsfont used to do.

Liliane groaned at the thought. She didn’t want to drag a basilisk through the streets. It looked impressive when a famed adventuring team did it, especially while Bodkins Tangleleaf was giving out free samples of its roasted tail. But if she tried it, half the town would need to offer help.

But she couldn’t let things stay as they were. 

For one thing, even with free accommodation, free meals and free … well, most things, Liliane wasn’t exactly overflowing with crowns. Marinsgarde was a well where coins vanished–often ending up as a shiny coat button.

She glanced at three children fighting over a limited edition Ophelia plushie. Two were in tears and another had swollen cheeks.

And then her hands clenched once more as a fire long dormant welled up inside her.

Liliane couldn’t remain idle any longer. Not if she wanted children to brutally fight over her as well. And as she arrived at the door of the Adventurer’s Guild, she felt as though fate itself was dangling the next road just front of her.

“... Goblins,” said a farmer still in his overalls to the exasperated adventurer trying to eat his lunch outside. “They don’t allow themselves to be seen. Not unless they’re up to something that’ll see all my flock turned to mutton overnight. You hear me? You need to do something about this.”

“Sir, I’m very sorry, but this is something for the guards.”

“The guards won’t even listen. They’re more afraid than you are. And not for a single right reason. I’m telling you, they’re up to something. I see it in the day. I hear it in the night. They’re digging. *Searching*. And I promise you now sure as the sun that not a single one of you will end up liking what they’ll find.”

“Look, I understand your concerns. And I’ll relay them … once I’ve finished my sandwich. But this is out of our hands. Goblins are for the lord and lady to handle. Not adventurers. These days, there are all sorts of agreements and … eh?”

Liliane offered a kindly smile as she appeared beside them.

Then, she leaned towards the farmer.

“Tell me more.”

The Missouri River: its habits and eccentricities described by a personal friend,kansascity,1h7fg24,2024-12-05 13:03:48,2,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/1h7fg24/the_missouri_river_its_habits_and_eccentricities/,como365,,"By George Fitch
American Magazine (63:6), April 1907

There are rivers of all lengths and sizes and of all degrees of wetness. There are rivers with all sorts of peculiarities and with widely varying claims to fame. But there is only one river with a personality, habits, dissipations, a sense of humor and a woman’s caprice; a river that goes traveling sidewise, that interferes in politics, rearranges geography and dabbles in real estate; a river that plays hide and seek with you today and tomorrow follows you around like a pet dog with a dynamite cracker tied to its tail. That river is the Missouri.

The Missouri River was located in the United States at last reports. It rises in the southwestern part of Montana and tumbles, slides, meanders,, sidesteps and plays leapfrog for forty-two hundred miles to the Gulf of Mexico. There are people who maintain that the Missouri flows into the Mississippi and becomes absorbed by that noble stream just above St. Louis. I suppose these same people, if they had a friend who had met a lion in Central Africa and had been merged into the hungry beast, would say, with tears in their eyes, that he had come to his death by swallowing the lion. There would be just as much reason in the one remark as in the other.

There isn’t any Mississippi left to view after it meets the Missouri. The Mississippi is a beautiful, majestic stream which minds its own business and flows placidly along the course laid out for it by nature ages ago. It is as stable as a brick house. You can always count on finding the Mississippi just where you left it last year. But the Mississippi-Missouri is a tawny, restless, brawling flood. It cuts corners, runs around at nights, fills itself with snags and traveling sandbars, lunches on levees, and swallows islands and small villages for dessert. This description fits the Missouri to a T, just as the description of the man and the lion who formed a combination fits the lion and hasn’t any likeness to a man.

It is a perpetual dissatisfaction with its bed that is the greatest peculiarity of the Missouri. It is harder to suit in the matter of beds than a traveling man. Time after time it has gotten out of its bed in the middle of the night, with no apparent provocation, and has hunted up a new bed, all littered with forests, cornfields, brick houses, railroad ties and telegraph poles. It has flopped into this prickly mess with a gurgle of content and has flowed along, placidly for years, gradually assimilating the foreign substances and wearing down the bumps in its alluvial mattress. Then it has suddenly taken a fancy to its old bed, which by this time has been filled with suburban architecture, and back it has gone with a whoop and a rush, as happy as if it had really found something worthwhile.

Quite naturally, this makes life along the Missouri a little bit uncertain. Ask the citizen of a Missouri River town on which side of the river he lives, and he will look worried and will say: “On the east side when I came away.” Then, he will go home to look the matter up and, like as not, will find the river on the other side of his humble home and a government steamboat pulling snags out of this erstwhile cabbage patch.

It makes farming as fascinating as gambling too. You never know whether you are going to harvest corn or catfish. The farmer may go blithley forth of a morning with a twine binder to cut his wheat only to come back at noon for a trot line, his wheat having gone down the river the night before.

These facts lead us naturally to the subject of the Missouri’s appetite. It is the hungriest river ever created. It is eating all the time, eating yellow clay banks and cornfields, eighty acres at a mouthful; winding up its banquet with a truck garden and picking its teeth with the timbers of a big red barn. Its yearly menu is ten thousand acres of good, rich farming land, several miles of railroad, a few hundred houses, a forest or two and uncounted miles of sandbars.

This sort of thing makes the Missouri valley farmer philosophical in the extreme. The river may take away half his farm this year, but he feels sure that next year it will give him the whole farm of the fellow above him. But he must not be too certain. At this point the law steps in and does a more remarkable thing than the river itself may hope to accomplish. It decrees that so long as there is a single yard of an owner’s land left ---nay, even so long as there is a strip wide enough to balance a calf upon, he is entitled to all the land that the river may deposit in front of it. But when that last yard is eaten up, even though the river may repent and replace the farm in as good order as when it took it, the land belongs to the owner of the land behind it. There is no way of getting around this decision. All the despoiled owner can do is to buy the farm back the farm back of his erstwhile farm and wait patiently for the river to eat up to his land. Then, if it recedes, he may not only get his old farm back, but the one between his old one and his new one and possibly a few more for good measure. Roulette is child’s play compared with it.

This thing happened in Kansas City not many years ago. A party of men owned a strip of land along the Missouri River bank. It was not handsome land, but it was valuable for factory purposes. They were offered portly prices for it, but held on. One day they noticed that the strip was getting emaciated. They held a hurried diagnosis with a surveyor’s tape and found that half of it had wasted away. The next year half of the remainder had gone.

The men wanted to sell then, but the market seemed remarkably sluggish. The next year the river ate so vigorously that only a tiny strip about as wide as a piece of baby ribbon was left. The men were much depressed.

Suddenly the land began to increase. The Missouri had chosen the late manufacturing spot for a place to deposit a fine 160 acre farm upon which it had foreclosed up the river. Inside of six months that strip of land contained 200 acres. The men were jubilant, but still they would not sell. They wanted another 100 acres, they said. They strolled along the bank each day and urged the river, in proprietary tones, to build faster.

Then the river changed its mind once more and not only wiped out the extra 100 acres but the original 100 acres, every foot of it. The next year it built up 500 acres in the same spot, but they all belonged to the man who owned the groud behind the original plot. They have stayed there ever since ---that is, up to last reports. For high financing and property juggling the Missouri River makes a crooked lawyer look like a child I hate to think what it would do for a man if it had a personal friendship for him.

The Missouri is the original loop-the-loop artist. The river for most of its length flows in giant loops with which it is forever performing circus marvels, leaping nimbly from one loop to another in a single night. It is these loops which are the cause of such hideous confusion in the boundary affairs of Nebraska and Iowa. The river, loops and all, is supposed to do duty as a boundary line between the two States. A lot of thoughtless legislators, years ago, made the grave mistake of nailing down the boundary line, making it immovable, where the river happened to be at the time.

Now the loops of the Missouri are about as fixed and immovable as a two-year-old colt. A dozen times in a decade the river goes tearing across some narrow neck of land, leaving a 30 mile loop of its old course to dry up and become farming country or city lots with that foolish boundary line still anchored firmly in its midst. The result is that the State boundary line to-day is wherever the river isn’t. Little tongues, scallops and slivers of Iowa stick across the river into Nebraska in a score of places, and little wedges,, triangles and promontories of Nebraska can be found all over the western edge of Iowa. Each of these invaders on both sides marks the location of a loop of the river fifty years ago. The river itself has retired, leaving the boundary line behind it.

The result is confusion immeasurable. You may live on the east side of the river and yet be in Nebraska. You may live on the west side, and still be under the control of a party boss in Iowa, cut off from his benign influence by a foaming, unbridged river. You may live on the south side of the river, but according to the law you may be either on the east side in Nebraska or on the west side in Iowa, or squarely in the middle of the stream, yelling for help. It’s enough to make a man lose his faith in geography.

Omaha, Neb., and Council Bluffs, Ia., are separated from each other by the river and three miles of bottom land. Yet, up in the north part of Omaha, there is a semicircular slice of Council Bluffs entirely surrounded by Omaha. The river once extended up there in a huge loop and Council Bluffs built into the loop. Then the river cut across the neck of the loop and transferred that ward of Council Bluffs to the Nebraska side. It is now filled with Omaha factories and pleasure resorts which Council Bluffs cheerfully works into its census returns, thus increasing the sisterly love which exists between the two cities.

On the Iowa side of the river a few miles away the Burlington railroad runs up the valley into Council Bluffs. Years ago the river began to show a liking for the railroad. It edged up closer and closer and finally swallowed a few rods of it. The company took the hint and moved back half a mile. The river followed after like an affectionate Newfoundland pup.

The company attempted dissuasionary measures. It carted a hundred trainloads of stone to the river bank and dropped them in. The river smacked its lips and swallowed the stone along with another acre of land for good measure. A thousand loads were dumped in. Not a trace of stone could be found the next day. Then the railroad company drove immense piles deep into the ground and anchored them with steel chains, big enough to hold a battleship in leash. The river didn’t waste time with the bulwark, but just swallowed the whole field in which it was located and leaped joyfully on toward the railroad track.

Then the railroad company gave up and moved back among the foothills. After this was done, the Missouri moved too. It went over to the other side of the valley, leaving another of its spectacular loops which today is beautiful Lake Manawa, one of the finest pleasure spots in the Central West. Lone fishermen, angling for bass in its placid waters, frequently hook sections of iron rails and chains by mistake and play them for several minutes in a vain attempt to bring them to the gaff.

It is estimated that in the last one hundred years the Missouri has shortened itself over two thousand miles by cutting out these great loops. This sounds interesting. It sounds as if the river had almost cut itself out altogether ---that Helena, Montana, ought, by this time, to be pretty close to Kansas City. As a matter of fact, however, for every loop that the river cuts out it makes another of equal size on somebody’s farm land where it isn’t needed. So there is no danger that the Missouri’s mouth will ever swallow its head.

Because the river is always busy dissolving farms and shifting sand bars it is the muddiest stream in the world. It is so thick that it cracks, sometimes, in working its way around the bends. At certain seasons of the year there is scarcely enough water to keep the mud moist, and it has to be drunk with a fork. Throw a man into the Missouri and he will not often drown. It is more likely that he will break his leg. In every glass of good, ripe Missouri River water there is at least a peck of sediment. Old residents claim to have made grindstones in the early days by running Missouri River through a big pipe and cutting it into flat disks with handsaws as it came out.

In the old days the Missouri teemed with steamboats. They plied the river in flocks, schools and droves, doing an enormous business and making such profits that the owner paid for his boat in two trips and watched it sink on the third trip, $25,000 ahead. Of course there were awkward little circumstances occasionally. Sometimes a boat would have a big passenger list ofr a town and wouldn’t be able to find it – the river having either removed it or run away from it over night. And sometimes the river would sneak away from a fine steamer that had been tied up over night. But, on the whole, the business prospered until the railroads came. Then the steamers vanished. Today the river is as lonely as a school room in vacation. From St. Louis to Sioux City, its tawny bosom is unscarred by a single paddle-wheel except when a government packet noses its way upsteam or the calliope of a venturesome excursion steamer awakes the echoes of the past for a few brief weeks in summer. Occasionally a farmer, plowing his field, runs the point of his plow into the buried pilot house of one of the old fleet of steamers and swears, thought not as fluently as the one-time mate of the steamer. Then he knows that the river once ran where he is plowing and that the proud boat that has driven his plow handle into his ribs once breasted the current where now he raises the lowly potato.

All these facts have given rise to the statement that the Missouri is no longer navigable. This is a very foolish statement. Of course the Missouri is navigable. The trouble is that those who have tried it have spent too much time trying to change river to conform to the steamboats when they should have been making over the steamboats to conform to the river. The Missouri River steamboat should be shallow, lithe, deep chested and exceedingly strong in the stern wheel. It should be hinged in the middle and should be fitted with a suction dredge so that hen it cannot climb over a sandbar it can assimilate it. The Missouri River steamboat should be able to make use of a channel, but should not have to depend on it. A steamer that cannot, on occasion, climb a steep clay bank, go across a cornfield and corner a river that is trying to get away, has little excuse for trying to navigate the Missouri.

Scientists tell us that the Missouri’s peculiarities are due to the loose alluvial soil through which it flows --- a soil so soluble that the least flirt of current will dig a hole into the bank which in time widens to a bay, then to a horseshoe curve and finally to a loop thirty miles around. This explanation may be satisfactory to scientists, but it is thin and unpalatable to those who know the river and have sat up nights with it. “Alluvial soil” sounds plausible, but does it explain that mysterious force beneath the freckled and turbulent surface of the river that digs vast wells one hundred feet deep one day and fills them up the next with sandbars for steamboats to run aground on? Does it explain the force that laughs at abutments, fascines, willow mattresses, ripraps, wing dams, stone dams, state lines and cuss words, and that snatches the work of months away in a single night? Does it explain why a river will run ten miles an hour due south over a level sand flat one year and five miles an hour due north not half a mile away the next? Does it explain the thousand mysterious eddies, the turbulence that boils out of the river like an eruption or the giant hand that clutches the fisher boats from below and draws them down? Does it explain what makes the river a mighty flood in South Dakota and a miserable trickle at Omaha? Can it diagnose that Queer, eerie half murmur, half cuckle with which the water goes about its work of destruction? Does it account for the innate deviltry of a stream that will sleep quietly while a railroad builds a million dollar bridge over it and will then move over and flow around one end of the bridge; and then when another million dollar bridge has been built to please it, gets quietly up and moves back to its old channel in perfect content?

“Alluvial soil” is a pretty fair sort of amateur explanation, but it would grow humpbacked and decrepit trying to carry all the blame of the Missouri’s record. More things than alluvial soil are ailing the Missouri. Blessed be the man who shall first find a way to chain it down and pull its teeth.

The Missouri River. Its habits and eccentricities described by a personal friend,missouri,1h7ciju,2024-12-05 11:02:30,32,0.85,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/1h7ciju/the_missouri_river_its_habits_and_eccentricities/,como365,Humor,"By George Fitch
American Magazine (63:6), April 1907

There are rivers of all lengths and sizes and of all degrees of wetness. There are rivers with all sorts of peculiarities and with widely varying claims to fame. But there is only one river with a personality, habits, dissipations, a sense of humor and a woman’s caprice; a river that goes traveling sidewise, that interferes in politics, rearranges geography and dabbles in real estate; a river that plays hide and seek with you today and tomorrow follows you around like a pet dog with a dynamite cracker tied to its tail. That river is the Missouri.

The Missouri River was located in the United States at last reports. It rises in the southwestern part of Montana and tumbles, slides, meanders,, sidesteps and plays leapfrog for forty-two hundred miles to the Gulf of Mexico. There are people who maintain that the Missouri flows into the Mississippi and becomes absorbed by that noble stream just above St. Louis. I suppose these same people, if they had a friend who had met a lion in Central Africa and had been merged into the hungry beast, would say, with tears in their eyes, that he had come to his death by swallowing the lion. There would be just as much reason in the one remark as in the other.

There isn’t any Mississippi left to view after it meets the Missouri. The Mississippi is a beautiful, majestic stream which minds its own business and flows placidly along the course laid out for it by nature ages ago. It is as stable as a brick house. You can always count on finding the Mississippi just where you left it last year. But the Mississippi-Missouri is a tawny, restless, brawling flood. It cuts corners, runs around at nights, fills itself with snags and traveling sandbars, lunches on levees, and swallows islands and small villages for dessert. This description fits the Missouri to a T, just as the description of the man and the lion who formed a combination fits the lion and hasn’t any likeness to a man.

It is a perpetual dissatisfaction with its bed that is the greatest peculiarity of the Missouri. It is harder to suit in the matter of beds than a traveling man. Time after time it has gotten out of its bed in the middle of the night, with no apparent provocation, and has hunted up a new bed, all littered with forests, cornfields, brick houses, railroad ties and telegraph poles. It has flopped into this prickly mess with a gurgle of content and has flowed along, placidly for years, gradually assimilating the foreign substances and wearing down the bumps in its alluvial mattress. Then it has suddenly taken a fancy to its old bed, which by this time has been filled with suburban architecture, and back it has gone with a whoop and a rush, as happy as if it had really found something worthwhile.

Quite naturally, this makes life along the Missouri a little bit uncertain. Ask the citizen of a Missouri River town on which side of the river he lives, and he will look worried and will say: “On the east side when I came away.” Then, he will go home to look the matter up and, like as not, will find the river on the other side of his humble home and a government steamboat pulling snags out of this erstwhile cabbage patch.

It makes farming as fascinating as gambling too. You never know whether you are going to harvest corn or catfish. The farmer may go blithley forth of a morning with a twine binder to cut his wheat only to come back at noon for a trot line, his wheat having gone down the river the night before.

These facts lead us naturally to the subject of the Missouri’s appetite. It is the hungriest river ever created. It is eating all the time, eating yellow clay banks and cornfields, eighty acres at a mouthful; winding up its banquet with a truck garden and picking its teeth with the timbers of a big red barn. Its yearly menu is ten thousand acres of good, rich farming land, several miles of railroad, a few hundred houses, a forest or two and uncounted miles of sandbars.

This sort of thing makes the Missouri valley farmer philosophical in the extreme. The river may take away half his farm this year, but he feels sure that next year it will give him the whole farm of the fellow above him. But he must not be too certain. At this point the law steps in and does a more remarkable thing than the river itself may hope to accomplish. It decrees that so long as there is a single yard of an owner’s land left ---nay, even so long as there is a strip wide enough to balance a calf upon, he is entitled to all the land that the river may deposit in front of it. But when that last yard is eaten up, even though the river may repent and replace the farm in as good order as when it took it, the land belongs to the owner of the land behind it. There is no way of getting around this decision. All the despoiled owner can do is to buy the farm back the farm back of his erstwhile farm and wait patiently for the river to eat up to his land. Then, if it recedes, he may not only get his old farm back, but the one between his old one and his new one and possibly a few more for good measure. Roulette is child’s play compared with it.

This thing happened in Kansas City not many years ago. A party of men owned a strip of land along the Missouri River bank. It was not handsome land, but it was valuable for factory purposes. They were offered portly prices for it, but held on. One day they noticed that the strip was getting emaciated. They held a hurried diagnosis with a surveyor’s tape and found that half of it had wasted away. The next year half of the remainder had gone.

The men wanted to sell then, but the market seemed remarkably sluggish. The next year the river ate so vigorously that only a tiny strip about as wide as a piece of baby ribbon was left. The men were much depressed.

Suddenly the land began to increase. The Missouri had chosen the late manufacturing spot for a place to deposit a fine 160 acre farm upon which it had foreclosed up the river. Inside of six months that strip of land contained 200 acres. The men were jubilant, but still they would not sell. They wanted another 100 acres, they said. They strolled along the bank each day and urged the river, in proprietary tones, to build faster.

Then the river changed its mind once more and not only wiped out the extra 100 acres but the original 100 acres, every foot of it. The next year it built up 500 acres in the same spot, but they all belonged to the man who owned the groud behind the original plot. They have stayed there ever since ---that is, up to last reports. For high financing and property juggling the Missouri River makes a crooked lawyer look like a child I hate to think what it would do for a man if it had a personal friendship for him.

The Missouri is the original loop-the-loop artist. The river for most of its length flows in giant loops with which it is forever performing circus marvels, leaping nimbly from one loop to another in a single night. It is these loops which are the cause of such hideous confusion in the boundary affairs of Nebraska and Iowa. The river, loops and all, is supposed to do duty as a boundary line between the two States. A lot of thoughtless legislators, years ago, made the grave mistake of nailing down the boundary line, making it immovable, where the river happened to be at the time.

Now the loops of the Missouri are about as fixed and immovable as a two-year-old colt. A dozen times in a decade the river goes tearing across some narrow neck of land, leaving a 30 mile loop of its old course to dry up and become farming country or city lots with that foolish boundary line still anchored firmly in its midst. The result is that the State boundary line to-day is wherever the river isn’t. Little tongues, scallops and slivers of Iowa stick across the river into Nebraska in a score of places, and little wedges,, triangles and promontories of Nebraska can be found all over the western edge of Iowa. Each of these invaders on both sides marks the location of a loop of the river fifty years ago. The river itself has retired, leaving the boundary line behind it.

The result is confusion immeasurable. You may live on the east side of the river and yet be in Nebraska. You may live on the west side, and still be under the control of a party boss in Iowa, cut off from his benign influence by a foaming, unbridged river. You may live on the south side of the river, but according to the law you may be either on the east side in Nebraska or on the west side in Iowa, or squarely in the middle of the stream, yelling for help. It’s enough to make a man lose his faith in geography.

Omaha, Neb., and Council Bluffs, Ia., are separated from each other by the river and three miles of bottom land. Yet, up in the north part of Omaha, there is a semicircular slice of Council Bluffs entirely surrounded by Omaha. The river once extended up there in a huge loop and Council Bluffs built into the loop. Then the river cut across the neck of the loop and transferred that ward of Council Bluffs to the Nebraska side. It is now filled with Omaha factories and pleasure resorts which Council Bluffs cheerfully works into its census returns, thus increasing the sisterly love which exists between the two cities.

On the Iowa side of the river a few miles away the Burlington railroad runs up the valley into Council Bluffs. Years ago the river began to show a liking for the railroad. It edged up closer and closer and finally swallowed a few rods of it. The company took the hint and moved back half a mile. The river followed after like an affectionate Newfoundland pup.

The company attempted dissuasionary measures. It carted a hundred trainloads of stone to the river bank and dropped them in. The river smacked its lips and swallowed the stone along with another acre of land for good measure. A thousand loads were dumped in. Not a trace of stone could be found the next day. Then the railroad company drove immense piles deep into the ground and anchored them with steel chains, big enough to hold a battleship in leash. The river didn’t waste time with the bulwark, but just swallowed the whole field in which it was located and leaped joyfully on toward the railroad track.

Then the railroad company gave up and moved back among the foothills. After this was done, the Missouri moved too. It went over to the other side of the valley, leaving another of its spectacular loops which today is beautiful Lake Manawa, one of the finest pleasure spots in the Central West. Lone fishermen, angling for bass in its placid waters, frequently hook sections of iron rails and chains by mistake and play them for several minutes in a vain attempt to bring them to the gaff.

It is estimated that in the last one hundred years the Missouri has shortened itself over two thousand miles by cutting out these great loops. This sounds interesting. It sounds as if the river had almost cut itself out altogether ---that Helena, Montana, ought, by this time, to be pretty close to Kansas City. As a matter of fact, however, for every loop that the river cuts out it makes another of equal size on somebody’s farm land where it isn’t needed. So there is no danger that the Missouri’s mouth will ever swallow its head.

Because the river is always busy dissolving farms and shifting sand bars it is the muddiest stream in the world. It is so thick that it cracks, sometimes, in working its way around the bends. At certain seasons of the year there is scarcely enough water to keep the mud moist, and it has to be drunk with a fork. Throw a man into the Missouri and he will not often drown. It is more likely that he will break his leg. In every glass of good, ripe Missouri River water there is at least a peck of sediment. Old residents claim to have made grindstones in the early days by running Missouri River through a big pipe and cutting it into flat disks with handsaws as it came out.

In the old days the Missouri teemed with steamboats. They plied the river in flocks, schools and droves, doing an enormous business and making such profits that the owner paid for his boat in two trips and watched it sink on the third trip, $25,000 ahead. Of course there were awkward little circumstances occasionally. Sometimes a boat would have a big passenger list ofr a town and wouldn’t be able to find it – the river having either removed it or run away from it over night. And sometimes the river would sneak away from a fine steamer that had been tied up over night. But, on the whole, the business prospered until the railroads came. Then the steamers vanished. Today the river is as lonely as a school room in vacation. From St. Louis to Sioux City, its tawny bosom is unscarred by a single paddle-wheel except when a government packet noses its way upsteam or the calliope of a venturesome excursion steamer awakes the echoes of the past for a few brief weeks in summer. Occasionally a farmer, plowing his field, runs the point of his plow into the buried pilot house of one of the old fleet of steamers and swears, thought not as fluently as the one-time mate of the steamer. Then he knows that the river once ran where he is plowing and that the proud boat that has driven his plow handle into his ribs once breasted the current where now he raises the lowly potato.

All these facts have given rise to the statement that the Missouri is no longer navigable. This is a very foolish statement. Of course the Missouri is navigable. The trouble is that those who have tried it have spent too much time trying to change river to conform to the steamboats when they should have been making over the steamboats to conform to the river. The Missouri River steamboat should be shallow, lithe, deep chested and exceedingly strong in the stern wheel. It should be hinged in the middle and should be fitted with a suction dredge so that hen it cannot climb over a sandbar it can assimilate it.

A steamer that cannot, on occasion, climb a steep clay bank, go across a cornfield and corner a river that is trying to get away, has little excuse for trying to navigate the Missouri.

Scientists tell us that the Missouri’s peculiarities are due to the loose alluvial soil through which it flows --- a soil so soluble that the least flirt of current will dig a hole into the bank which in time widens to a bay, then to a horseshoe curve and finally to a loop thirty miles around. This explanation may be satisfactory to scientists, but it is thin and unpalatable to those who know the river and have sat up nights with it. “Alluvial soil” sounds plausible, but does it explain that mysterious force beneath the freckled and turbulent surface of the river that digs vast wells one hundred feet deep one day and fills them up the next with sandbars for steamboats to run aground on?

**Chapter 321: Open For Business**

“W-W-What is this … ?!”

My mouth widened at the scene before me.

Creeping over the horizon, the town of Marinsgarde made itself known by the flash of its brightly coloured rooftops.

Borrowing directly from the Kingdom of Lissoine, its many chimneys were decorated with shop signs, compasses and clocks, allowing those looking on from afar to glean which businesses to peruse first.

To see Marinsgarde glinting beneath the spring sunshine was a cue for celebration. After all, it meant I would soon be admiring its many fashionable windows filled with overpriced curiosities the Royal Villa's stewards would never recall purchasing.

Normally, that is.

Because currently, there was a problem.

That wasn't unusual, of course. There was always a problem. If it wasn't something exploding, it was something about to explode.

However …

*Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.*

Of all the horrors I’d survived, all the inn meals I’d forgotten eating and all the places I'd witnessed turning into a ball of billowing flames, nothing had ever compared to this.

Yes. 

I was currently experiencing my greatest hardship yet.

Because as Apple bore me along the cobbled road, I saw little of the town's famed textile industry at work, nor the gruelling sweat of those managing it. 

All around me, the fields outside Marinsgarde were empty of the farmers regretting their life decision of being born a peasant and not a princess. Only a scattering of daisies remained to colour the fields, the bright petals swaying merrily against a faint breeze.

After all—

The flocks of sheep which usually devoured them were no longer in the fields.

They were on the road instead.

*Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*.

Tiny lambs. Big lambs. And lambs so big they were actually just normal sized ewes.

The sound was overbearing. The smell even more so.

However, wherever I turned my nose in search of freedom, I only found them looking back at me instead … often via their head bumping directly into my leg.

A veritable horde of livestock hopping, grazing and attacking me at their pleasure, all the while their fluffy coats remained waiting to be sheared.

Apple did his best to escape the bedlam.

He trotted along without pause. And yet they simply trotted along with him. Like ducklings to a very shaggy maned mother, the flock gathered around my noble steed.

And that meant they gathered around me as well.

“Shoo, shoo!”

I desperately waved away my assailants.

It was like waving away my suitors in a soirée. One would leave, but another would come. All without invitation. Left, right, behind and in front, they disregarded my personal space as much as any notion of shame.

Naturally, I was horrified.

To succumb to the baying of a mob was the greatest fear of all princesses. But it was all the greater if I wasn't even the sole target. An enterprising and far too optimistic lamb bit upon the designated pastry bag, sensing the buttery goods waiting within. I shooed it away with both hands. 

And then the next. The next. And then more next.

After a while, I threw up my beleaguered arms in exasperation instead.

It was just as effective.

“W-Why are there so many sheep here … ?!”

“Uwaaah\~”

Beside me, I was answered by the strangest cry so far.

Coppelia, to my horror, was being lost amidst a surge of sheep.

I'd seen her face fire and darkness, madness and magic, yet against the unrelenting onslaught of livestock, her strength and dexterity were no match. 

Especially as she appeared to be inviting them with a bundle of grass in her hand.

“Heheheheheh ... that's right, eat well ... the Coppelia de Restaurant is always open\~”

I pursed my lips.

Yes.

They continued gathering around her … even when they perhaps shouldn't.

“C-Coppelia! We are under assault … by farm animals … w-what should we do?”

“Hmm … I guess give up?”

“Excuse me?!”

“Well, there's too many. Sometimes, you just have to accept fate. Warm bundles of fluffy fate. Hey, have you tried petting them?”

“I … I most certainly have not! Why would I do that?!”

“Because it feels *amazing.* Look, look! The fluffiness! You can't even see my hands!”

“Please, Coppelia.” I sat up straighter, all the while accidentally brushing against a lamb as I shooed it away. Over and over again. “I am a princess. I cannot touch livestock. Why, that would be not only deeply appropriate, but also highly … w-why, is it so soft?!”

“I know, right?!”

To my shock, the wool I was mysteriously poking was beyond anything I'd ever felt.

It was both fine and springy. Like a mattress demanding to be hopped upon.

This … This was unprecedented! 

Why, even the silk I imported from the Summer Kingdoms failed to compare to the lushness of the lamb I was accidentally petting! And yet if such a fabric was available in my own kingdom, I surely would have known?

My mind spun with questions. 

Was this the true quality of wool before it was sheared? Transported? Or perhaps before it was even spun into yarn? Clearly, a stage in the process was lacking. The raw ingredient certainly wasn't.

If … If this could be solved, then so could half of my imports being lost to banditry!

A moment later, I was leaning towards each lamb, carefully assessing their coats while marking them by the shape of their ears and the curliness of their tails.

Indeed, this one here could be made into a fine pillow stuffing ... and this one was also sufficient as a thick duvet … while this one was perhaps appropriate as an autumn scarf or a … no, wait!

“Shoo, shoo, shoo!!”

Fearing for my standing, I straightened my back while attempting to nudge the horde away. It made as much of a dent as huffing at the clouds.

Then, I let out a tiny groan as I simply accepted my place in this world.

A princess beloved by even nature's children.

As inappropriate as it was for every animal to bump into my ankles, it was only natural that my aura of kindness drew all towards me. Just as the hands of my subjects wished to illegally steal a touch of my person, so too did the noses of my kingdom's sheep.

Yes … even if most of their attention seemed to be where the croissants were.

“I never knew your tiny kingdom had such a big petting zoo,” said Coppelia, giggling as she poked away the most aggressive of the lambs from the pastry bag. “How come you don't advertise this more?”

“Firstly, my kingdom is not tiny. It is as wide as the horizon currently blocked by a wall of sheep. Secondly, there is nothing to advertise. This is *not* a tourist attraction.”

“You're right. This is better than that. Even in Ouzelia, there's usually only one sheep to distract each group of smelly children. Here, they get an entire flock each!”

“Nobody gets a flock. Not even to distract children, worthy as that cause is. This is a prized example of my kingdom's textile industry. And now it's simply … *marauding* at will.”

Coppelia hummed, all the while helping me inspect the best future pillows.

“Okay, well, I'll put my hand up. I didn't know your standards were so high. By letting your sheep rob travellers, you make sure they eat a variety of food and gain a whole bunch of life experience. I'm sure that translates into super fluffy wool.”

“Please, Coppelia. That's just silly. Given the standard of most travellers, the quality of the wool would only decrease.”

“... Soooo, you're not against your sheep robbing people in principle?”

“I'm against my sheep robbing anyone I don't explicitly point at. Frankly, this is appalling. It's one thing to be waylaid by brigands, but sheep is another matter entirely … just where *are* my farmers?”

Indeed, no matter where I looked, I saw no hint of a bedraggled peasant.

Those tasked with managing this flock were as absent as the bales of hay they were usually found in. While I regularly spied my farmers napping in the fields, I could equally rely on Apple's snorting to ensure their lazing came to an end.

Now even that option was missing. And I already suspected why.

My thoughts turned to the looting I'd seen. 

Of the audaciousness which surely went beyond desecrating a single tomb.

Indeed, if goblins lacked the tactfulness to at least empty a tomb during appropriate nighttime hours, then I had no doubt their mischief extended far beyond it.

Had they now caused my farmers to flee into hiding? Their boldness was beyond anything I’d seen since the signing of the treaties. Given their numbers, it would be little surprise if all the fields, farmsteads and barns were now emptied of my slacking peasants.

Even so, to abandon their flocks so close to the town was beyond any explanation I could fathom.

Indeed … something was terribly amiss!

I could sense it like my mother in a suspiciously good mood. Except now I had no window to escape through. My only path was ahead. And now it was flooded with livestock which had no right to be here.

With a deep breath, I turned my gaze towards Marinsgarde in the near distance.

The decorations upon the rooftops and chimneys no longer seemed to gleam. The faint breeze which tousled my hair seemed to cease. A sudden stillness pervaded the air, as though a dire panther in the dark was holding its breath, waiting to spring upon us.

Thus, I offered a smile.

“Ohohoho … how poor.”

“Hmm\~?”

“Something foul is afoot. I can smell it like an ill omen in the air.”

“Really? Are you sure that's not the sheep?”

“... No, but regardless, our adversaries have overplayed their hand. And that’s wonderful. To line the road with goblins and empty fields is a warning only those who cower from fruit slimes heed. There’s such a thing as too much. Whatever awaits us, we must be ready to roundly disparage it at a moment's notice.”

“Okie\~”

Coppelia offered a lazy smile. 

I nodded. The exact sort of lax response I wanted.

Thus, I tugged on Apple's reins. And with the sound of his fearless trots, the humming of my loyal handmaiden and the bleating of sheep as my accompaniment, I wore a dignified smile as Marinsgarde neared.

Unlike many of the larger settlements of my kingdom, almost nothing of its walls could be easily seen. With the Wisenlait Gate so close and little threat from our northern neighbour, they'd been eclipsed by the ever expanding list of shops hoping to monopolise the high street into the town centre.

A curiously ribbon-like town, as famous for its many patisseries as the only St. Liane workshop to exist outside the Royal Capital. 

Although it did not boast the economic importance of Trierport or the industrial strength of Stermondt, there was much to admire about its adherence to fashionability.

That’s why ... even before Apple's trots had stepped beyond the entrance of the town, we were greeted by an abundance of stalls.

Wooden signs rose high overhead as a fanfare of colour, each seeking to block each other out as much as the litany of rival storefronts. A welcoming committee of merchants competed for our attention. And while the colours of the awning were all different, the enterprising nature of those who worked beneath them were each the same.

A sight like any other.

Except for one thing.

There wasn't a single smile to be had. 

Which made sense.

After all, the customers were not smiling, either. Nor were they particularly talkative.

Rather … they seemed more than happy to simply point for what they desired.

My jaw dropped at the sight. Yet as I read the wooden signs staked before the nearest stalls, it somehow dropped even further.

*Cutlasses, falchions and scimitars! We have every type of sword at the Stolen Armoury! Buy one sword, get one dagger free now!*

*Rags & Bags! 50% opening sale! Get your finest scrap clothing and loot sacks, satchels and plunder bags of all sizes!*

*The Cave Fig Smoothie Company is now open for business! All figs freshly harvested from the dampest caves!*

*The Green Bazaar is open all day and night! Trade, buy back and purchase second hand loot at the best prices today!*

*GOBLIN HATS. I'M SELLING GOBLIN HATS.*

Yes.

They were all goblins. 

Buyers, traders and those who could alternate at the drop of a goblin hat. 

More numerous than the sheep grazing at the weeds, goblins filled the entrance of Marinsgarde, their noses wrinkling in tandem as they examined the wares on display or placed new ones down instead.

Of the many fashionable cafés, bakeries and boutiques, nothing could be seen amidst a plethora of hastily built stalls and makeshift storefronts.

Soon, a goblin walked up before me. 

He wrinkled his nose as my mouth failed to close, then pointed at the flock of sheep before holding up a pouch of coins. He shook it twice.

Coppelia looked at me, waved her hand in front of my face, then slowly plucked the pouch from the goblin's palm while nodding.

A moment later—

I threw up my arms in utter grief.

“... Why is my town a goblin marketplace?!”

On serving alongside women.,MilitaryWomen,1h3b6bo,2024-11-30 07:03:07,66,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryWomen/comments/1h3b6bo/on_serving_alongside_women/,BikerJedi,Discussion,"**Hi there! For those of you who don't know me, I'm one of the moderators of /r/MilitaryStories. Over the years, we have had some really good stuff shared from women veterans and servicemembers over there. I know your voices are typically marginalized, and I wanted you all to know you are welcome to share your stories of your service with us. Any sexism/racism/homophobia is met with an immediate ban in our community.**

**In honor of you all, I'd like to share this piece I wrote years ago and the lesson I learned. Y'all have a good one.**

*NOTE: No PERSEC violations here. Melissa is a public figure.*

We have had several posts by women veterans here on /r/MilitaryStories lately, which is great. I am thrilled to be seeing more women here and more non-US stories too. There has been some blowback against some of them. Misogyny is fairly rampant in the military, or at least the US military. And that translates to this community, with the large population of US vets we have here. Which is sad, because they have served alongside us men since the Revolutionary War. (And before anyone tries to argue with me, there is a reason the military has SHARP briefings.)

In any case, I had good and bad experiences with women in the Army. Just as I had good and bad experiences with men. But I'm sad to say, that as an 18 year old kid, I had no clue how things worked, so I fell into that misogyny.

11th ADA Brigade at Ft. Bliss consisted of 5/62 ADA (my unit - short range air defense) and 3/43 ADA, a Patriot missile battalion. There was also the training brigade and air defense school. In any case, 5/62 was all men, being a line unit in 1988. That means we maneuvered with the cavalry unit on post, 3rd ACR. (Armored Cavalry Regiment) As a front line unit, no women were allowed to serve then. The Patriot battalion was looked down upon by us, because they were a ""rear echelon"" unit, not doing any ""real"" fighting. That snobbery was made worse because women could be in Patriot units. So we laughed at them doing PT. It didn't matter if she was having a rough time because she was recovering from pregnancy, or on her period, or whatever - ""women shouldn't serve."" Then one battery of 3/43 couldn't deploy to Desert Storm because quite a few women were pregnant and several who didn't want to go went and got pregnant to avoid deploying. ""Women shouldn't serve.""

My slutty ex-wife, who worked at the Troop Medical Clinic on post helped cement that. The fact she was pretty openly fucking her clients (sometimes in her office) while I was deployed and getting away with it pissed me off. ""Women shouldn't serve.""

I overlooked the female Chief Warrant who gave me some good care when I was hurt. I forgot about the female Drill Sergeant who was a badass in 3rd platoon. Forgot I was grateful I didn't have her - she was meaner than the men by a mile and put all of us to shame. I forgot about the malingering assholes in my ""manly"" unit who decided they were conscientious objectors after we got to Saudi. I only saw the bad women and the good men. Ever. Seething over my pending divorce made it worse.

Then after Desert Storm, I met [Melissa Rathbun](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-08-02-mn-223-story.html). The TL;DR is that she was also stationed at Ft. Bliss. She drove trucks for the transportation unit. She also got deployed. Her unit was the one that had some trucks get lost, and she was taken POW with the men. All the POW's in Desert Storm were mis-treated and/or assaulted in some way, including the women.

I was out-processing and had to visit the JAG office. Melissa was working there. I didn't know her from anyone else, but I had read about her. When I sat at her desk, I saw the combat patch and POW ribbon. I about shit. ""YOU'RE HER!""

She was less than thrilled. She was working in the JAG office so they could ""trot her out for dog and pony shows"" as she put it. All she wanted was to be on the line with the guys and her truck. But she was a minor celebrity as a female POW. And she really didn't seem to like it at all. She looked at my packet and seeing that I was being medically discharged, asked what happened. I told her about my stupid accident getting my foot busted up. I wanted to stay in doing anything, and she just wanted to be back at her job.

I left that conversation just awestruck. She was just a SOLDIER - one who wanted so badly to be with her unit that it was killing her. And I could 100% relate to that shit right then. All I had left to do was hit finance and leave. She was closer to her unit that I was. I was awestruck because of how well she seemed to be handling things. 

That was when it hit me. ""Women should serve."" Women have served. 

And in the last 20 years, some women have distinguished themselves well in combat. They have been there, in the shit, with the men. They have bled and died with the men. And these wars weren't the first time for that, either.

I fucking hate intolerance and bigotry of any kind. This story is one reason why. I'm certainly not the young, dumb man I was in 1988-1992. And I'm so glad I got to meet Melissa. I'm sorry for what she and the other POW's went through, but she was an inspiration to me. I've thought about her from time to time. I figure if she could handle that, I can handle whatever gets thrown at me.

Say it with me. Women serve.

The Transexual Revolution Reared Its Ugly Head at My Hunting Club ,Sasquatch_Nazi,1h2954s,2024-11-28 19:03:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sasquatch_Nazi/comments/1h2954s/the_transexual_revolution_reared_its_ugly_head_at/,Kamalas_Liver,,"Me and old Clint were on the way to our hunting camp on this here particular Friday afternoon. I was riding with Clint this weekend on account of the fact that the goddamn finance company repossessed my Dodge Charger last week. So we piled up inta Clint’s big old F-650 work truck fer the trip. 

I had the old boy pull into the “Crash-N-Burn Liquor Store” to pick us up some adult beverages for the long ride out to the camp. Clint said, “Well, ok. But you knowd I cain’t drink and drive. The judge sed if’n I up an git me anutha DUI he is gonna take my license and put my ass in the county lock up.” I asked, “Hell, boy, how many them thar drunk drivin tickets ya’ll got now?” Clinton said he has 7 DUIs. I sed, “Hell, Clint, that thar ain’t that damn bad.” Then Clint clarified that he has gotten 7 DUI charges THIS YEAR, so far… 

I told old Clint, “Well fuck, Clint. Just don’t drink a whilst ya’ll is driving.  Mount sum self-control, ya sloppy motherfucker! I want me a beer!!” Clint pulled up through the drive-thru winder of that thar licker store. I bought 3 cases of Pabst Blue Ribbon, a half gallon of Jack, a pack of turkey jerky, and the latest issue of “Fat Titties”. The beer wuz cold so I popped one them thar sumbitches open as soon as we pulled outa thar. I asked old Clint, “You want a beer, boy?” He replied, “Shit yeah!!! Gimmee one of them sumbitches!!”  We then put some Conway Twitty on that old radio/cassette contraption and headed off, anticipating a relaxing weekend of deer huntin and drankin! 

I eventually had to take over driving duties from old Clint. He got hisself so gall-danged sloshed up that he up and t-boned a school bus droppin the lil crumb-crushers off at home. To make matters worse, it were one of them thar short busses. Old Clint panicked, crying “Oh Sheeyit!! What we gonna do?!? What we gonna do?!?” I slapped the old sumbitch across his face and sed, “We is gonna git!!! So let’s git…NOW!!!!”

Old Clint floored it, drove us into a ditch, then launched us plum airborn!! I grabbed the steering wheel and righted the ship, pointing us down the highway, but not before we took out a couple garbage cans and a few mailboxes! After we wuz outa sight of that damned old school bus, I got Clint to pull over on the side of the road so we could change places and I could drive. 

Now, admittedly, I were 3 sheets in the wind myself, having started on that bottle of Jack a half hour ago. But at least I weren’t hittin lil school chilluns! Clint got all kinds of upset at me fer takin over driving duties, so I let him git his old 7mm mag out so he hunt frum the truck until we got to camp. He managed to git him an old possum and a milk cow along the way, which made him feel a spell better. 

We finally made it to camp at round midnight. Being that I were so lit up I got us lost over thar in Sasquatch County, whar we eventually ended up at a Dairy Queen which also ran a cooter den out back. Neither old Clint er me could git our old old Jimmies up though cuz we wuz so inebriated. 

So we’uns rolled inta camp round the witchin hour. And my Lord!!! What a sight we up and dun seen when we got thar!!! Old Clint and I had dun sobered up a bit after enduring the humiliation of not being able to fuck them old injun Dairy Queen whoowahs back thar. Oh, the taunts and shame we felt!! But even if we dun still been hammered drunk, the sight we happened upon when we pulled into deer camp woulda set us straight, I tell ya what!! 

There at the old camp fire were our club brothers, old Cletus, Big Mac, and Eighty-Eight, the club president. They wuz a’standing thar looking down at another club member layin’ on the ground. Upon closer examination, the man on the ground were brother Wild Bill frum Doraville. And he were buck-ass nekkid!! 

I asked old 88 what the hell were going on. He said “This here sumbitch dun up and turned hisself into a WOMAN!!!” I figured he were pulling my laig. So I demanded to know what the meaning of this here ghastly sight were. 88 said, “Goddamnit!! I dun told ya!!  This here sumbitch dun made hisself a woman! Look!! See fer yerself!!”

Old 88 was pointing to Bill’s crotch. I squinted my eyes in the dim light and looked. I wuz simultaneously perplexed and confused. I pulled out my old dime store specs, put ‘em on my face and moved in fer a closer look. After a moment I took off my glasses, looked up at old 88, and sed, “I don’t see nothing.” Old 88 replied, “That’s the fucking point, man!!! He ain’t got no pecker no more!! He dun up an cut if OFF!!!!”

I looked again. It were true. Old Wild Bill no longer had an intact tallywacker. It weren’t ripped off either, like what ya see when thar been sum sort of farm equipment accident either. No sir! He dun had it surgically removed. I was at a loss fer words. 

Suddenly, old Cletus spoke up. “It were the goddamned ‘hard cider’ shit he’s bin drankin! It dun up and turned him QUEER!!!”, he said. Big Mac was looking at his feet and shakin his head. Old 88 said, “Look, we don’t exactly knowd what happened here. Maybe them damned grays been experimenting with Bill again. Hell, maybe they dun up and scrambled his brain and he dun it to hisself.”

Old Bill had been unconscious through all of this here conversation. He was knocked out when we got thar, in fact. Hell, I jest assumed he were dead. Therefore, you can imagine my shock I got when old Bill started moving. “Oh shit!!! He’s a’coming back to life!! Kill that sumbitch!!! He’s a fucking zombie!!!”, I exclaimed. 

88 looked at me and sed, “He ain’t no zombie, you stupid sumbitch! He were jest knocked out.” I wuz immediately relieved.  Hell, man, I were a hundert miles as the crow flies frum my post-apocalyptic shelter!! Then 88 told me the back story. 

It seemed that the boys had been sitting round the camp far earlier in the evening dranking, cooking beans, and dranking. Old Wild Bill then told the boys he needed to tell them sumthang important. He told them he were transistoring into a woman and that from now on he wanted to be called “Willamena”. Well sir, everbody got ‘em a good laugh, they figuring old Wild Bill were jest kidding with them. Then Billy got pissed and took his britches and drawers down to show ‘em his new womanly physique. The boys’ jaws dropped. 

Old Cletus, who always carries his old Hawg laig, a .44 maggum, loaded and in hand, finger on the trigger, accidentally squeezed off a round as he stared in shock. The bullet whizzed by Bill’s head, causing him to stumble, fall, and hit his head on a rock, knocking him unconscious. When old Clint and I came rolling in the boys were debating whether to put him outa his misery and finish him off. 

“Good gawd, 88!!!!”, I dun did sed, “You wuz gonna MURDER him?!?!” 88 replied curtly, “No sir!  I wuz gonna put him out of his misery!” I dun did thunk on it fer a moment then sed, “Ok. I can see that”. 88 nodded to me. But it were all were fer naught cuz old Bill were awakin up. 

Old Bill got to his feet and sed “GODDAMNIT, CLETUS!!! YOU NEARLY KILLED ME!!!” Thinking on his feet, old Cletus shot back, “WELL YOU CUT YOUR DING DONG OFF!!! HOW DID YA THINK WE WUZ GONNA REACT?!?” The tension wuz so thick ya’ll could cut it with a knife. But then things quickly changed. 

See, old Wild Bill commenced to explaining how his becoming a skirt were a good thang fer the whole club. See, Bill contended that once his transition is complete he would be coming to camp all dolled up like a real woman, with a cooter hole to boot. “Uh oh”, I thought to myself. I knew whar this wuz a’headin’, and I wanted no part of this here. I announced that I wuz going to bed, and that I were gonna be sleepin’ in Clint’s truck tonight, doors locked. 

I turned and walked away from the boys and toward the truck. All of a sudden I heard a loud gunshot ring out. “BLAMMMM!!!!!” My first thought wuz, “Oh shit!! They dun killed Bill!! I mean, Willomena!!!” But when I turned to see what happened, it were old Clint layin’ on the ground. All this here talk of penis loppin and dabbling is the devil’s domain were jest too much fer old Clint to bear. So he pulled out his old .45 and blew his own head off!!

As we all stared at Clint’s corpse in horror of what jest transpired, we dun heard the po-leece sirens. In an instant, the swat boys were on top of us!!! It seems they wuz after old Clint fer ramming’ that thar special needs school bus earlier in the evening.

Well sir, them old Johnny Law types kept us up all night with their questions and paperwerk and bullshit. The worst part wuz that they didn’t let us drank any!! Those rat bastards!!!

It were a pretty open and shut case, though. It seems old Clint, a habitual drunk driver, crashed into a school bus full of lil chilluns on the way to huntin camp, then felt so bad about it that he offed hisself frum the guilt. One cop, Officer Prickface, asked me point blank, “When Clint arrived here at deer camp, was he alone?” I dun looked that sumbitch in the eye an sed, “Yes he was.”  

That seemed to bother the pig, as it did not conform to eyewitness reports from the scene of the accident. I said, “Well hell, Officer. You sed he hit one of them thar short buses. Them thar water heads cain’t tell thar ass from a hole in the ground, ya know?” The cop pondered on this a moment, obviously unable to discount my wise old country boy logic, and sed “Yeah, you are probably right.”

Eventually, them pigs left, and it were time to hunt! However, being without no alkyhall fer the last 6 hours, we all dun got us a powerful case of the shakes. Old 88’s trigger hand looked as if it had a case of the catalytic seizures!! So we all deecided that we better git to drankin’ right fast like so at least we can hit the woods in the afternoon. 

It weren’t long before we fergot bout Old Wild Bill’s cock detachment and were a’sangin along to Conway Twitty cassette tapes being played on 88’s old VW’s stereo. Thangs got a lil blurry after that. My next mammary wuz wakin up in Old Wild Bill’s tent and seein that old boy wearing my drawers on his head and 88 layin’ on top of both of us, bare ass nekkid. Thank God fer the alkyhall! It dulls the pain and fades the mammories.

Starting over completely from scratch in personal finances during medical struggles. Ideas and suggestions are very much welcomed!,personalfinance,1gxfylm,2024-11-22 14:21:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gxfylm/starting_over_completely_from_scratch_in_personal/,Symbatine,Debt,"Hello Reddit! Long time reader, first time poster. Yikes, I'm so nervous...

Where do I even start? I want to be concise, but fear this will end up being extremely scatterbrained with seemingly unrelated questions. Please bear with me.

My husband recently let me in on a little secret of his: over $30k in various debts. We had assorted debts 10 years ago, and I was under the assumption these were all taken care of (minus my student loans). About 5 years ago I had a severe mental breakdown which left me hospitalized, and have been in intensive therapy (2+ times weekly) ever since. He had told me not to worry about finances so that I could focus on healing. At the time of my hospitalization, we had already been working steadily on our finances so when he told me not to focus on it, I assumed things were still going in the right direction. Yes, yes, I know what 'assuming' does, and I'm not proud of it. I already feel like an absolute fool! \*cue tears\*

At the time of aligning our finances 10 years ago, we sold a lot of our things (spare items, duplicates, collector's editions, kitchenware,  tools, etc...) to go toward an emergency fund and start the snowball process. We downsized our living arrangements, sold the second car, and he even got a promotion that transferred us to a lower-cost-of-living state. As of right now I still do not know the full extent of our current situation (context: the last time a huge stressor happened, hubby ended up in the hospital with Bell's Palsy induced by the stress. My goal right now is to do as much damage control as I can without triggering another paralytic episode, which is frustrating because this is incredibly important information for me to have, but not so important as to risk his life again). No, I don't know what exactly these debts paid for, nor do I care to find out. I have a feeling they are in part to my medical bills, in part to inflation, and in part to our diets having changed for less takeout. But the fact of the matter is that it is here now and it is no use of me to dwell on the ""should ofs"" and ""could ofs"" of past circumstances. I am well aware that the first thing I need to do is get all the information, which I will have by the end of the week.

Okay, on to our dilemma. He wants to take out a loan to pay back these various debts. My concern is that our income-debt ratio will not allow us to do this, plus I'm certain any application we put in will be flagged as high risk. I want to go back to a sort of 'snowball' method because that seemed to work decently enough for us the last time, but last time I was also employed and this time we have no 'extras' to sell off. I don't want him overly stressing about figuring how to get out of this hole, I'm home 24/7 and the very least I can do is try to figure this out for us. However, I'm grabbing at straws with such limited information and have absolutely no clue as where to begin. I'm open to ideas, even if it's something I've already tried. Maybe you'll have a approach that has not yet crossed my mind.

On to my dilemma. (This is starting to feel like a pity-party, and I'm getting off my own topic... Shame on me, but I'm going to write this out anyway if only to get off my chest...) My therapist and doctors don't want me working yet. ""When?"" I asked. ""In another 4-7 years."" 7 years! In this economy? With our current circumstances? Absolutely not! I need to figure out a way to help support our household outside of domestic duties. I am furious with myself for not having been able to contribute financially, and their telling me 'no' is only fueling my rage. I use to work as a physical rehab therapist and did retail on the side. Both were very physically demanding jobs that required hearing, which I am no longer capable of. So remote work it is. However, from what I can tell remote work has decreased immensely over the past two years. What few remote jobs I've seen are looking for roles that are way out of my league, or they are call centers which I would not be able to hear the caller. My biggest concern in finding remote work is that I would need to go back to school and take out atrocious loans to even begin to be qualified for these roles. If I want a remote job, then I need to learn more about technology based things. I learned how to type on a ribbon typewriter back in middle school, and learned Excell and other Microsoft programs in college. I can currently touch-type 90 wpm, and I use Inkscape in my hobbies. This is the extent of my up-to-date computer knowledge. I feel that these computer skills are now obsolete (especially with how quickly things change), and silly me didn't keep up with computers as it was not my career focus. I've no idea where to begin looking into learning a new tech skill. Is there even tech work that doesn't require a degree? Can tech things even be self-taught? I am very good at teaching myself new things, but I will only ever be as good as the sources my information comes from.

So, Reddit. I guess my questions to you here are two-fold: does anyone have insight where/how to begin balancing finances when starting over from scratch? does anyone have insight where/how to pursue a remote position for someone with hearing loss?

Thank you for your time!

I'll interact and update below when I check-in. I am not glued to my computer, so I won't be watching this 24/7.

(To admins/mods: I am aware these are technically two different topics, and therefore should be posted accordingly. I'll be cross-posting this as soon as I find the appropriate thread.)"
Should I've done this?,Coconaad,1gvuh67,2024-11-20 12:10:27,42,0.94,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1gvuh67/should_ive_done_this/,ron_dude146,:53: Rant & Vent ,"  Two days ago, we inaugurated our humble homestay. The day before the event, my aunt insisted that she should cut the ribbon because she’s the eldest among the three siblings. She initially made a small scene about it and then dropped the topic, or so we thought. Later that evening, while we were in the living room, she brought it up again, telling my dad that she deserved to cut the ribbon. At that point, I got tired of how she has been behaving to us all these years. I snapped and said with anger and a loud voice “Auntikk ribbon vettan ee veedu auntinte thandha indakki vechathaano?!” 



  To give some context, my dad grew up in Idukki and went to a government-aided school, walking 4–5 kilometers daily to school. But, my aunt attended a posh school in Ernakulam, back then being in such schools was considered a privilege only for the rich folks. When it came to college, my dad worked two jobs to fund his master’s degree, since my grandad only gave a few rupees for namesake to my dad, while my aunt’s masters at a prestigious college was completely financed by my grandfather. My aunt gathered supplies and to erase it off, my grandad bribed the college and she got a high percentile in those supplies. He could've used the money used for bribe for my dad’s fees.

 

  My dad had gotten a good job offer abroad which paid 3-4 lakhs per month, also an offer from a prestigious college abroad with full ride scholarship, but he had to let go off these just because my grandad manipulated and guilt tripped him to work for his spice business, where he had to load kilos of spice into the truck and transport it to other places. The spice business was just a leisure activity for my grandad just in case he got bored with his other businesses. My grandad ruined my dad’s life for no reason but to make sure my aunt is more successful than him. He used to be one of the richest guys in Idukki. I was just to be born in a few years, but he just spent his money in useless luxury, and gifted my cousin sisters (a.k.a Aunty’s punnaramol).   



  Later, when my grandfather fell into financial trouble due to giving away crores to random people, my grandad made my dad work to finish off random debts, so my dad did some really brilliant real estate business and made 70-80 lakhs in profit just in a few months. My dad really did have that potential for making it big in the tech industry, he and his buddies built a software back in early 2000s where they did a video call successfully on a cellphone, as a college project. Yet, despite all this, my grandfather wouldn’t even give my dad money to recharge his phone, thinking he’d waste it flirting with girls during late night calls. That was the point when my dad made a smart decision to move out and start fresh.  



My dad moved to the Gulf and built everything from scratch. He built a house, a car, and makes sure I get everything I need, I help my dad whenever I can, he provides me with a life where I am satisfied with everything. And, my aunt, despite her privileged education and a master’s degree, is jobless and lazy, her husband isn’t that qualified but is pretty wealthy. On top of that, she and my grandmother constantly taunt and harass my mom whenever they get the chance. My grandfather, too, always favored his punnaramol and his punnara kochumols, showering them with gold, phones, and expensive gifts. Meanwhile, the only thing I ever got was two bajjis, three fried rice, and a bucket of ice cream.

 My dad when he moved abroad, he has been calling my aunt from his phone at least once in 2 days no matter how busy he was, for the past 18 years, until last month where he stopped, cuz he read an article where if there are relatives who don’t call you back even if you are in constant touch with them, they aren’t the real ones, he just tested it out, so he decided to not go for outgoing calls to kerala. So, my aunt didn’t call him for a month, and neither did my grandma call my dad. So they aren’t the real ones. Also I got one thing out of my chest, which I revealed to my mom, which is that I really hate my aunt and I hate my grandpa very much. There would be people here who might find this offensive, but ithanente avastha. I am here seeing my friends enjoying their grandparent’s pocket money and love, there are some of them whose grandparents didn’t leave anything big cuz they lead normal lives, but my grandad was one of the richest guys and lost it all, it could have been avoided if he thought of my dad’s future kids but he just ruined his life, which my dad didn’t allow to take over him.



Since I had gotten that heavy secret outta my chest and reminded my dad how unfair the family is, they both are siding with me.However, my aunt (a.k.a apoopante punnaramol) and grandmother have been ignoring me and my mom ever since. My dad built the house along with big sacrifices from mine and mom’s side, not an inherited house, thats why i said “Thandha indakki vechathaano?”. 



Now I’m wondering, Was I right to call her out, or did I go too far?

  


Sorry for this long post, this is also a vent that I have been keeping inside me for 6-7 years…

" [Ashes to Ashes, Earth to Kaybee] - Episode 1",redditserials,1gpy1il,2024-11-12 17:55:15,3,0.72,2,https://i.redd.it/ofjshsd3wj0e1.png,GracefulEase,Science Fiction,"Rickard had two impossibly good views before him: his wife sleeping in her hibernator, and their verdant new planet 14,770 miles below.

And yet his eyes clung to the heart monitor above her pod, its jagged trace and incessant beeping suggesting again and again that her heart was failing, telling him her heart wasn’t okay even though he knew that it was the best damned heart there ever was.

Beneath the bleeping monitor, in defiance of its diagnosis, Tabi slept peacefully. Her dark curls undulated in the suspension fluid’s artificial current, beckoning, as her slender fingers had once drawn him onto a dance floor. Rickard stroked away a smudge from the glass between them, his thumb brushing within an inch of a prismatic marble’s reflection: K2-18B. Their only hope, now that Earth was gone.

He tore himself away from her palette of soft browns to look out of the podship at the world far below. Unlike The Blue Marble photographed over two centuries ago, this marble was moss green and saffron yellow and grape purple. Except it was none of those colors. K2-18B had no moss or saffron or grapes. It had yulicki and emmon and aubracias.

“Mr. Carfine.” His name sounded from the comms system, echoing around a million other hibernators but touching only dozens of conscious ears. “Please join us in Launch Bay A.”

Despite the phrasing, it was not a request. And despite that, he had no plan to comply. They could make a song and dance about landing on their new planet without him.

Motion in his peripheral, ten hibernators away, toward the center of the ship. Dr. Fusō floated toward him between the columns of uniformly stacked hibernators, her trademark lab coat—immaculate—blossomed around her like a lily. Like Rickard, she was thirty-ish, but a little taller. A long rod held the xenologist’s straight black hair up in a bun.

“They want to go down, now,” she said. ‘They’ meant the uber-rich that had financed this exodus from Earth, the Krejov and Al Nahyan families. The seven richest humans on Earth.

In space, Rickard corrected himself.

“Good for them,” he grumbled. “Tell them to send me a postcard.”

Dr. Fusō chuckled and pushed lightly on his chest before checking their surroundings, horizontally and vertically. He tried to back away, but she followed after him, whispering in his ear, “Is it just me, or are there too many empty pods?”

Offense at what felt like seduction and implication warred with confusion. “What are you—”

“There’s twenty-four of us awake. I don’t have access to the whole ship, but I swear I’ve found more empty pods than that.”

“Hibernation’s not perfect. We anticipated a few losses.”

“I know. I’m sure there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation. But just in case—”

“Rickard Carfine. Dr. Jigoku Fusō. You are required at Launch Bay A,” the comms system blared.

“We better go,” she said. “Before they think we’re up to no good.” She pulled away from him and gave him a scandalous wink.

The empty pods were probably nothing. But if those hibernating were in danger, that meant Tabi was, too.

“I’m not leaving her. She'll be confused when she wakes up.”

Awaking in suspension fluid with zero gravity after years in hibernation had a way of scrambling your circuits, as Rickard had learned thoroughly two weeks prior. Even if time-dilation from traveling at 99.999% lightspeed made the 124 year journey feel like four-and-a-half years, that was still a mighty long time to be trapped in artificial slumber.

“Rickard. They aren't waking anyone else up until the new settlement is ready. If you leave putting together your fandangled machine to them, who knows when that’ll be.”

‘Fandangled machine’ was an interesting way to describe the fabricator that had created this ship, the thousand ships following, and given them the means to colonize K2-18B. Given living matter, it could print anything of an equal amount of mass.

Rickard mulled over his options like churning through a mouthful of nutrient paste looking for a cluster of artificial flavors.

Reluctantly, he put an open palm on Tabi’s pod. “Hold on, Tabi. I'll get you out soon.”

As he propelled himself through the zero-G beside Dr. Fusō, he couldn't help but glance inside every hibernator they passed.

*

“Ah, you finally join us,” Diyab Al Nahyan welcomed Rickard and Dr. Fusō as they reached the launch bay, grabbing handholds to arrest their momentum. “You almost missed man’s first step upon our new home!”

“And women’s,” Nina Krejov, Rickard’s boss, added, giving the richest man in space a glare. Although she, as CEO of Automaxion, held the universe’s silver medal for capitalism.

Twelve people floated around the port of the shuttle: Diyab’s and Nina’s families, their family bodyguards, and Dr. Hayward—a medical doctor whom Rickard greatly enjoyed calling ‘the real doctor’ in front of Dr. Fusō.

Rickard barely heard them. Were people missing? How many? Why? Was Tabi in danger? He struggled to look them in the face. There were only two dozen men and women awake on the ship: if something nefarious was afoot, odds were the culprit was here. Knowing the ethics of the more financially-burdened pioneers, the odds were probably pretty high.

“I should apologize. I was captivated by the view,” Rickard said. He should apologize, in their minds at least, but he wasn’t going to.

A space helmet appeared from the shuttle door, bearing a young woman’s head. “Y’all ready to go on down?” the astronaut, Colonel Sharman, asked.

Diyab’s two teenage boys kicked off from the bay walls and barged past her, shortly followed by Nina’s seven-year-old daughter, and then the adults, until the shuttle held all fifteen of the first humans that would tread upon a planet in over 125 years.

*

Rickard’s knuckles whitened around his harness as the shuttle rattled, hinting at the roar of the thrusters outside as they descended from the podship to K2-18B’s surface.

Despite scores of successful tests on Earth, there’d been no way to physically simulate the twenty-percent higher gravity, or the thicker atmosphere with its different composition. Heedless of the thousands of man hours that had scrutinized every detail, Rickard’s anxiety mentally probed over the extended flaps, re-entry lift dynamics, thickened heat shield, and a hundred other failure modes.

Stern faces, clenched fists, and spacesuits ringed the moon-white interior in an eightfold symmetry spoiled by a single empty chair. Tabi could have been sat there, but they had made him leave her behind.

The air in Rickard’s suit was stale, partially from five and a half years of disuse on the journey here from Earth, but mostly from adrenaline-fueled sweating and panting. That each of the four bodyguards rested a hand on the pistols at their hips did little for his elevated heart rate. Due to the unknown biology of the planet, the trillionaires had insisted upon guns on the ground, despite Dr. Fusō’s repeated explanation that it was unnecessary.

He should have been ecstatic, bursting with anticipation. He was going to be one of the first humans to ever set foot on K2-18B. But instead he was stuck worrying about Tabi and missing people and being trapped in a pressurized vessel with a bundle of firearms. The contradiction made him so angry that bile stung the back of his throat.

Fear soon replaced his anger as the shuttle’s vibrations spiked in intensity, and his stomach sank into his ass as the acceleration flip-flopped on him.

Then, a quiet thud.

Rickard waited for the downward force on his body to relent, but it didn’t, and he felt heavy.

“We are here!” Diyab shouted, evidently eager to be the first human to talk on their new home.

“We have landfall,” Colonel Sharman confirmed from the console that hung from the ceiling in front of her, and a moment later their pliable helmets retracted into their suits.

They were on the surface of K2-18B. Rickard felt a surge of the ecstasy he had been denied on the descent, and wished Tabi was beside him.

“Congratulations on a successful collaboration,” Nina told Diyab, leaning against her restraints to shake his hand. Both she and Diyab’s spacesuits featured a thick gold ribbon built into the otherwise salt-white material, to mark them as founders of this expedition.

Her husband, Kirk, sporting a silver ribbon, attempted to reach over Nina to do the same, but after an awkward thirty seconds of straining against his harnesses he settled for, “Very well done. Excellent show.”

They waited while Colonel Sharman ran through her post-flight checks, and after a minute, a brief chorus of clicks sounded around the shuttle.

“What was that?” Dr. Hayward asked, staring at the holster squished between him and the guard beside him. He was the youngster of their group, a prodigy who had graduated Harvard Medical School at eighteen.

“Tertiary safety coming off,” the guard replied. She was one of Krejov’s. “Wouldn’t want it going off mid-descent. Don’t worry, though. They’re still perfectly safe.”

Rickard didn’t particularly want one going off now, either, and he cringed as she drew the gun.

“They’re smart guns,” she continued. “Can’t shoot a human without authorization. Look.”

With unnerving efficiency she flicked off the safety, aimed it at Dr. Hayward’s foot, and pulled the trigger.

Nothing.

She blew the non-smoking barrel, twirled the gun around her finger, and slipped it back into her holster. Rickard wanted to march across the shuttle and slap her across the face, but his harness and a lack of guts prevented him.

“That wasn’t nice,” was all he managed, barely audible.

She raised an eyebrow before disregarding him.

Another chorus of clicks sounded as the harnesses released. Without fanfare, the four bodyguards rose and moved to the airlock door, their boots pounding against the floor in the stronger gravity.

“Air pressure 1.23 atmospheres,” the shuttle’s AI announced. “Air composition: 58% nitrogen, 25% oxygen, 14% hydrogen, 2% water vapor, trace amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, dimethyl sulfide, and helium.”

“Breathable. As the long distance scans indicated,” Dr. Hayward confirmed, timidly.

“I would still like to execute the canary protocol,” Nina said.

Diyab nodded. “Agreed.”

The Krejov bodyguard with the poor gun etiquette stepped into the airlock, and one of Al Nahyan’s locked the door behind her. The armored woman tapped a cross between her shoulders in prayer to a god of Old Earth.

It felt weird referring to their former home that way. With the induced hibernation, it felt like they had left yesterday. But there was no going back. As his ancestors had once referred to their European origin as ‘the old country’ after moving to America, he needed to accept that Earth was now his old planet.

Krejov’s bodyguard pulled a lever, and the airlock emitted a loud hiss as alien air flooded in.

The two trillionaire families inhaled so audibly with fear, anticipation, and ignorance, that Rickard thought his ears would pop.

After thirty long seconds, Krejov’s bodyguard turned and gave them a meaty thumbs up through the airlock window.

“Oh, Nina, I'm so excited. This is it,” Kirk Krejov said, shaking at Nina Krejov’s arm.

“Are you ready to do this?” Diyab Al Nahyan asked.

Nina nodded back. “One small step for the two greatest humans, one giant leap for mankind!”

Rickard eye-rolled involuntarily and bit his lip, hoping none of the trillionaires had seen.

A bodyguard pulled the inner lever, and the airlock opened once more. As arranged, Nina and Diyab entered the airlock first, receiving a brisk salute from the bodyguard within. Then the two richest people in the universe awkwardly clutched at one another while the canary strapped Nina’s right foot to Diyab’s left. The awkwardness only grew as they limped out of the exterior airlock door and down the ramp in the most surreal three-legged race Rickard had ever seen.

But this was necessary. Tabi, and a million other souls, had to stay hibernated, at risk of whatever the heck was happening up there, so that these two could make sure they were both the first person to step on K2-18B.

They stopped at the end of the ramp. A stillness settled over everyone. The bodyguards rested hands on weapons, their gazes fixed upon the opposing trillionaire.

He wanted to shout ‘Hurry up!’

The Al Nahyans and Krejovs, now gathered in the airlock, began a raucous countdown.

“Three. Two. One!”

Holding each other for balance, Nina and Diyab lurched their bound feet forward and stepped upon virgin soil.

A gunshot rang out. It hit Rickard like a slap, and he dove to the floor, skin stinging in shock.

Dr. Fusō and Hayward cowered against the walls of the shuttle, but the Krejovs and Al Nahyans just laughed, and a moment later showers of confetti rained down beyond the open airlock.

Dr. Fusō rose and slipped over to Rickard. “Well,” she whispered, leaning in closer than he would like, vanilla wafting out of the neck of her suit. “Let's hope we are right about the lack of sapient beings on this planet.”

“Sapient?” he asked, moving away from her as he got to his feet.

She raised an insulting eyebrow that all but asked if he was an idiot. “Thinking. Wise. More like us than like the xenoarthropods.” She gestured at currents of winged alien insects coursing across the landing site, past the airlock door.

Rickard hung back as the other trillionaires flushed out of the shuttle, followed by their bodyguards, rushing around Nina and Diyab who were struggling to free themselves from one another.

“How sure are we?” he asked. “About the thinking beings, I mean.”

“My team and I came out of hibernation three weeks ago. We’ve run dozens of exploration drones down here for thousands of hours. Not seen anything smarter than a goldfish.”

Well that was some reassurance, for his own well-being, at least. But his mind tangled on the well-being of those 14,770 miles above. He lowered his voice. “How many do you think are missing—”

Dr. Fusō smushed two fingers against his lips, and twitched her head toward Colonel Sharman who sat across the shuttle still working at the console.

“Your missing bolts?” she replied, eyes wide, silently screaming at him to shut up. “I dunno. A hundred? Two? I'm sure you'll find them.”

He pushed her hand away. “I hope so.”

**Chapter 310: Into The Fire**

Dragons.

There was little which needed to be said. Even those who had never known the terror of a badger nibbling upon a purple azalea knew the tale of dragons. 

Where liches and receptionists fought to climb higher upon the ladder of children’s nightmares, they did so only as paupers elbowing each other over rungs which dragons had long soared over. They were kings of earth and sky, residing not upon the world, but over it.

And here was one so regal it could only be woken by a princess’s gentle presence.

Like a mountain of emeralds given life, the dragon slowly shifted. A waterfall of coins cascaded down its enormous form, the odd few becoming stuck between its scales. 

Golden eyes, half-lidded and drowsy, gazed without focus at the modest hoard serving as a bed. 

Its response was the same as mine. A wrinkling of the nose. Except this one came with a cloud of smoke. As its nostrils flared, twin plumes able to warm the temperature of the cavern rushed out, darkening what little sky could be gleaned from the fissure high above.

A moment later–it turned its head.

Cheeks as hard as bedrock and horns more pointed than any lance came to rest against the bed of gold. Yet any hope this was a pillow to help it return to slumber was lost. 

Even as its head rested, its eyes did not.

The haze lessened. The slit of its pupils narrowing as the starch began to fade. And a gaze filled with a familiar greed began to count each and every coin. 

Indeed … I knew this look well. 

After all, there was only one thing which could surpass even a dragon’s greed. And that was the hubris of every dignitary to have laid eyes upon my father’s throne. 

I preferred none of them.

Thus, I turned to Coppelia and nodded.

“Very well. We have a dragon.”

“We sure do\~! Look, isn’t he nice and cuddly? And by nice and cuddly, I mean huge and spiky.”

“He’ll certainly require one of the larger tea tables, yes.”

“You can probably give him any. I think he’s in a good mood. Normally, he’d have yelled at us and demanded pancakes for waking him up already. Isn’t this wonderful?”

A fresh plume of smoke billowed from the corners of the dragon’s maw. A telltale sign of someone so averse to being woken that no words of complaint could suffice.

I sympathised. But even that went only so far. 

“What is wonderful would be a greeting,” I said with a rueful shake of my head. “For a dragon to be so mesmerised by gold that neither thought nor gift is spared to a visitor heralds to the days they rained terror and destruction upon the continent, sending all life fleeing before them.”

Coppelia nodded.

After a moment, she remembered to turn off her smile as well.

“And that is *bad*.” Coppelia paused, waiting in case I had to correct her. “Very, very bad.”

“Indeed, it would be terrible. The hedgehogs would have free reign to multiply without abandon.”

“That’s exactly what I meant. If all human towns and the smells they constantly make were erased, the rest of us would be overwhelmed with the scent of fresh flowers and happiness.”

“Happiness is already prevalent throughout my kingdom. It is mandatory while my subjects are shielded by the warmth of my family. We do not require competition from a dragon’s flame.”

Coppelia leaned down and poked at her fallen colleague. 

One whose final test was failed by the lack of any gloating. 

Instead, she was taking the place of the previously sleeping dragon, her idle smile galling but insufficient as she closed her eyes to the world’s dissatisfaction. Only the key on her back moved, the individual clicks now discernable as the turns slowed.

“You’ll need to ask Fleur once she exits emergency napping mode. Which you should hope is soon. I’m actually not too sure what the big guy will do now, since she was the one with the reins and all.”

“If she had the means to goad this dragon into doing whatever she wished, then surely you do as well?” 

“Eeehh … I dunno, she was always his favourite. Maybe because she did small things like all the finances, the scheduling, the management and the pancake restocking. I don’t think I’m getting through. Not with this goldlust. That’s a pretty serious thing.”

“I see … is it a disease, then?”

“Nope. A disease can be cured. This is worse. You know how peasants like drowning themselves in alcohol to distract themselves from their worthless and miserable existences? Goldlust is like that. Except they collect treasure instead of alcohol, they’re a lot less picky about which places they embarrass themselves in and after they pass out, they’re out for two centuries.”

I nodded at the grim sight.

Indeed, I saw it far too easily. 

A dragon sated, asleep, and thoroughly clogging up room within the Royal Villa’s vault. 

There were practical applications to possessing a sleeping dragon, of course–stewards accidentally leading our nobility down several wrong hallways while also accidentally locking all the doors behind them being one of them. But not at the cost of our wealth being used as a mattress. 

Why, that’d simply be awful. What would my troll do? It’d be a professional insult to make him guard what a dragon already was.

“No worries, though\~” said Coppelia, uttering the only words to make me worry. “I can fix this!”

Thus … she lifted up her scythe.

I was *horrified*.

“Excuse me! You surely cannot mean to murder your employer? That is *not* a precedent I wish to set!”

“Eh? I’m not going to murder him! I’m just going to hit him really hard!”

“... That *isn’t* trying to murder him?!”

“Ahaha\~ don’t worry. There’s no way that’s anything more than a tickle. And for the big guy, it’ll be aimed right above his brows. One scratch there and it’s back to snoozing!”

“Coppelia, this is a dragon, not a cat.”

“... Would you prefer it if this was a cat?” 

I thought for a moment.

“No,” I admitted.

Coppelia gave an unabashed giggle.

Then, she raised her arms and stretched, before promptly bounding away with graceful ease.

Paying as little care to mortal danger as she did bakery signs not to touch the products, she leapt fearlessly like a moth to a flame. 

Higher and higher she went, her lithe form going unseen against the commanding presence of the dragon as it exited the realm of dreams. And then with an unnecessary twist in the air, she came down with her scythe held high above her in a tickle which looked remarkably like a normal attack.

“*Dusk falls anew, the last light amidst paling faith. Luna Form, 6*^(th) *Stance ...* \[Moonlit Divider\].”

So normal, in fact, that only a falling piano offered a harsher entry back into the world of slumber.

Her scythe cleaved the air, leaving behind a trail of light to defy the same shadows which wreathed it. A sight usually guaranteeing that something which existed now wouldn’t in a few moments.

Instead–

*Plink*.

An unscathed dragon was the result.

Her scythe struck with all the force of a toothpick against a boulder, comically bouncing off the scales at the crown of its head. However, that didn’t mean there was no effect. 

The golden eyes blinked. 

Once, twice, three times … until finally the lids began to close once again.

I was stunned. As was Coppelia. 

“Huh,” she said while idly hanging off the tip of a horn. “I wasn’t expecting that to happen.”

“... Does that mean it actually worked?”

“*Maybe*. And that’s a problem.”

“Why is that a problem?” 

“Because these things never work.”

A sudden inhalation of breath from the dragon confirmed her well-founded fears.

All at once, a wave of gold crowns rushed towards its snout. The eyes which had begun to close remained half-lidded. And cheeks which had no means to form expressions nevertheless grew taught, the wrinkles becoming apparent even through the scales.

And then … an altogether different crease appeared upon its face.

One I’d seen often. Most keenly by the Holy Church’s highest representative as he was led through the Royal Villa’s expansive gardens, all of us having forgotten about his debilitating pollen allergy. Again.

This … This dragon.

Why, it was about to do something unfathomable!

… And the direction it faced was where a princess stood and a fallen librarian now lay!

Horrified at what was to come, I turned at once towards the helpless figure beside me. 

Without thought, I moved at once. 

My limbs obeyed naught but instinct as I hurriedly leaned down, reached out towards the defenceless girl, and with no regard to my own safety, bravely grabbed Dawning Summer and scampered away.

“**Hm …** ***hmmmpph***\*\*!\*\*”

The flame which was unleashed was like the heart of a volcano bursting asunder. 

A sudden belt of molten lava erupted from the dragon’s maw, joined by a plume of smoke blacker than tar as it charred the very air. But this was no mage’s replica. It was a force unrestrained, able to melt the coldest steel along with the anvil which forged it. 

And now it was billowing towards me like a streaking comet. 

The temperature rose as though an open kiln had been dropped into a cupboard. Yet for all the light which now filled the cavern, all I saw was the blackness of death. A premonition written in every tale to involve a dragon’s flame. 

To be struck by dragonfire was to enjoy a brief cremation without ceremony. 

That was poor enough. But this was somehow worse.

This … This was a *sneeze*!

Not even a stream of flame sent out in anger … but an allergic reaction to Coppelia! 

To die to a dragon in righteous combat was at least inoffensive. But to die to a dragon due to it being tickled behind the ears? Why, that was so humiliating my ghost would never find rest amidst all the laughter!

No. I refused to contemplate it. 

Dragon or not, my end would come at a time and place of my choosing. And my schedule was currently so filled I didn’t need to look at it. Every action I took ticked something off.

All except death because a dragon didn’t use a handkerchief.

Thus, raising Starlight Grace, I … 

*Fwooooooooooooosh*.

… looked to the side as Dawning Summer promptly caught fire in my other hand.

“Wha–?!”

To my utter shock, what was a summer’s glow now became a living brand. 

One which drew all the molten snot towards it like rain towards a gutter. 

Alight with the fury of a hearthfire doused with kindling and lamp oil, the sword bloomed as the dragonfire was absorbed … no, *devoured*. 

Ribbons lashed the air as though cast forth from a whip, while embers dripped from the tip like a thousand fireflies.

A sight so beautiful and mesmerising, I could do nothing but immediately toss Grandmother’s sword to the ground, before promptly kicking dirt over it in order to smother the sudden flames.

It … It was *terrifying*!

“S-Stop! Stop at once!” I told the sword, increasing the pace of my shovelling. “Stop! You are only to burst into flames on demand! And only at a level which doesn’t overshadow my own brightness!”

Far from obeying its new owner, the sword only continued to merrily burn. A flame so wildly impractical even the hilt was now entirely wreathed. 

That, as it turned out, was the least of my problems.

“**Hrrhmmmmmmm**.”

Smoke and flames exited the dragon’s snout once more. Except this time, it wasn’t to signal another sneeze.

Our dragon was now very much awake.

*Bwoomph. Bwooomph.*

The sound of drums filled the cavern.

One by one, clawed legs wide enough to turn a hill giant into its own artisanal purée lifted from its bed, then slammed back into the gold. 

Like a princess sampling a new bath mat, the dragon’s great legs languidly tested the fine texture and the cooling metal.

Coppelia finally swung away as the dragon rose.

Higher and higher it went. A visage of regal power wrapped in the displeasure of one who was clearly not an early riser. As the dragon presented itself upon its hind legs, not a single missing scale was there to be exploited. And yet for all its majesty, it was still besmirched by a great blemish.

Those eyes doused in the foreign colour of gold, clashing with the green of its birth.

“**GWWAAAAAAAAAARRRRRR**.”

It roared.

A bellow so visceral, so primal it shook through the arms covering my ears. 

The ground itself quaked along with my limbs as the world threatened to end. Dust and bits of stone came falling down. And also Coppelia as she landed beside me, enthusiastic smile at the ready.

“Safe\~” She turned to me and nodded. “... Okay! You get to decide! How do you want to be carried?”

I gingerly released my ears, still hearing the bellowing.

“Excuse me?”

“Over my shoulder or under my arm? You get to pick how you want to escape the giant fireball by the big grumpy dragon when he notices us in about five seconds.”

My mouth widened.

“C-Coppelia! … There are more appropriate ways to carry me than either as a rug or as a sack!”

“... Like as a fruit slime? Because that’s less carrying and more throwing and catching you as I go.”

An appalling suggestion … and not because experiencing that at least once sounded the slightest bit intriguing.

“There will be no need to carry me,” I declared, turning my frown towards the dragon as its tail scooped up a line of glittering coins. “We are not escaping.”

“Now that’s just pessimistic. We’re really good at escaping explosions.”

“Yes … Yes we are. But that’s beside the point. I do not mean to escape from this dragon. Not if it means seeing him again along with my mother asking why I seem to know him. I intend to put this entire Ouzelia debacle behind me. Not punt it down the road.”

“**GWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRR**.”

A second bellow filled the cavern.

No … not just a bellow, but a yawn. 

Accompanied by a stretching of wings, they swept outwards like a pair of windmills. The shadows were even greater. An endless mural of darkness painted upon the cavern wall behind by the light of two swords. 

One of which I was still trying to put out.

For a moment, even my loyal handmaiden could only blink at me. 

However, any doubts she harboured were given no leave to fester. Nothing could break the strength of my noble intentions. And even less my wish to avoid association with this land of oddballs at all costs.

Thus, she nodded … then offered all her assistance by sitting atop her fallen colleague.

“Wooooooooooooooo!!” Coppelia raised an arm in cheer. “It’s time! The next stage of \[Ball Of Doom\]!”

“E-Excuse me! Please do not spread that name unnecessarily! It is not \[Ball Of Doom\]! It is a delicate gardening technique! … Furthermore, I am still in the process of refining the current iterations …”

“No problem! Cheap and underhanded is also good!”

“A slanderous insinuation. I am as fair and honourable as the kingdom I represent. And so long as your apple strudels are funded directly from our personal funds, that is the official line.”

“Got it\~ how do you plan on fairly beating the really big dragon, then?”

I looked up at the dragon in question.

It didn’t take a forum of sages to know that there was only one answer–I didn’t.

After all, if a princess could simply defeat a dragon, I wouldn’t count them as my natural foes.

However … that didn't mean I had no contingencies in place.

On the contrary, it was precisely because I was a princess that I was uniquely suited to the task ahead. 

Knights may have lances and heroes outrageous amounts of luck. But I had a weapon greater than both. 

Not for slaying dragons. But for surviving them.

“I’ve no means of felling this dragon. But I’ve no need to. It is time to perform Emergency Dragon Protocol #57.”

Coppelia nodded with excitement, fists tightly scrunched against her chest. 

“Ooooh\~ I never knew there were contingencies for facing a dragon which wasn’t running away faster than the guy next to you!”

“There isn’t. For commoners, at least.” I raised a hand to my lips, barely covering my smile. “Ohohoho … rejoice, Coppelia. And observe. For you shall now see a sight to burn into your memories brighter than any dragon flame. Note what you shall see, but never speak of it again.”

“Okie\~”

I nodded … and then took a deep breath.

Yes, it was time at last to display my true qualities as a princess.

Thus, I patted myself down, then left the cheering of my audience behind as I strolled towards the disgruntled behemoth of death. 

An action so without precedent that the dragon shook away its waking temper to at last see the fragile maiden in its midst.

Within those maddened eyes, the black slits widened with all the right of one appalled at the impertinence of an open thief.

“**GWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR**.”

Except I was no such thing.

I was an honoured guest.

And so I ignored the bellowing, trained as I was by the echoes in the Royal Villa whenever my father stubbed his toe against a door. I ignored the embers dribbling from the jaws, accustomed to the flames regularly seen exiting Clarise’s observatory. And I ignored the gaze of unremitting death, seeing only a pale imitation of my etiquette tutor when she found me admiring the vines beneath a window.

The dragon was unimpressed.

A neck stretched out as its entire frame lowered. 

The rows of guillotine teeth were revealed, each capable of grinding a chimney until it was indistinguishable from the soot it bore. Within its maw, an endless darkness was punctuated only by the heart of a flame so ancient it could melt the Summer Fae.

And against it all, I lifted Starlight Grace … then idly sheathed it away.

I offered a polite smile instead.

“Salutations,” I said with a nod, knees slightly bent, lifting the very hem of my skirt in a perfectly angled curtsy. “I am Princess Juliette Contzen, 5th in line to the Kingdom of Tirea. It is a pleasure to meet your acquaintance.”

The dragon stilled.

The smoke exiting its orifices didn’t lessen. But the shadows behind its wings did.

A moment later … it blinked.

Once. Twice. Three times.

Except this time, it wasn’t the allure of gold it saw. 

No … it was something far rarer, beyond the worth of any trove or the beauty of any trinket. Something which shone brighter than the lustre of any coin or jewel. 

A candle in the darkness, washing away the delirium of greed.

*… Me*.

Ohhohohohoho!

Here it was! My ultimate ability!

\[Princess Presence\]!

Indeed … I did not need my healing fingertip for this! 

All I required was my own aura … a light so warm and gentle, that a fourth blink later, neither curse nor madness could hold sway!

Like the first breath after a deep plunge, the dragon shuddered, sending not the tremor of a quake, but a song as calming as a summer draft through the air. 

The shadows rescinded. The veil of avarice was lifted from its eyes.

And what remained was as smooth as the finest jade.

After all–

Gold spoke to its greed. Yet I spoke to its heart. 

A princess without equal, even in the realm of fairy tales.

Thus … the dragon promptly reached out and wrapped a claw around me.

I nodded and smiled.

Yes.

This was indeed better.

Aio / aibu boyfriend is selfish ,AmIOverreacting,1gm03ya,2024-11-07 15:22:43,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gm03ya/aio_aibu_boyfriend_is_selfish/,Born-Ambassador3796,❤️‍🩹 relationship,"So me (24f) have been with my boyfriend (33m) for about 3 months now, although we have known each other for a long time and was seeing each other for a while becoming “official”. 

For context I’m a single mum to a nearly 2 year old, through no fault of my own and he is living with his mum in a house that has been bought and doesn’t require mortgage payments. We both work part time jobs, I’m a barmaid and he’s a porter somewhere else. 

I don’t make that much, minimum wage and I receive a bit of a top up off the government to be able to pay my rent etc while my daughter is still small and I’m struggling to work full time. 

Boyfriend doesn’t have much to pay for, but has some money in the bank that he is determined to use as a down payment for a mortgage. Trouble being, by the time he’s saved what he wants to save, I can’t see anyone offering him a mortgage on a part time income at the age of 40+. This is where my problem is, he won’t stop telling me I need to save up, to help with this mortgage, that I never said I wanted. I’m quite happy where I am and have lived here a few years now, made it home for myself and my daughter. 

Aside from the whole saving up argument, he doesn’t understand I have bills, rent a child and food etc to pay for, he doesn’t have children so ofc doesn’t understand how expensive it can be, but also won’t listen to me when I try to explain. Not that I want to get into the habit of explaining my finances to him, we’re not married. 

I have borrowed some money off him, £100 odd until the end of this month, he offered and I accepted. I found out today he’s wrote me in his little debt book and reminded me about the money. I hadn’t forgotten and of course it isn’t the end of the month yet either. I assured him I would pay him back within the next few weeks as agreed. That seemed ok but then a conversation came on about how he only has a few hours at work and every penny counts. 

He’s that bad that he is perfectly ok with me paying for stuff, meals, dinner at home, bus fare on outings etc… takeaways but won’t pay for stuff himself. He bought breakfast the other morning and I offered to pay my share, he declined and then moaned about how £14 was so expensive for breakfast for hours. For 2 adults? I didn’t think so but hey ho we all have different definitions of expensive. 

The same night we were going to a firework display and I suggested getting hotdogs on the way while in the town centre, he blurted out rather abruptly “have you got hotdog money?” Which I had yes and wasn’t expecting him to pay but that kind of caught me off guard. I paid for both of us as my daughter was sleeping and I got her something later on. It was £9 for both. 

A few hours after that I was getting my daughter some chips at the firework display, he asked for a bottle of water I said yeah ok. That cost me £11 including a can of coke for myself, he said “I’m glad I didn’t have to pay for that” I was gobsmacked? I don’t know if I’m totally unreasonable or not but with his own money just sat in the bank I feel as though it’s selfish making me pay for the majority of things? He transferred me £50 cash for my birthday and I spent £70 on a gift for him with personalised ribbons and beautiful wrapping paper. That bugged me too, because I put so much thought into gifts and he just sent me money? 

I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable or not and if this is normal but I feel like now it’s clear why he’s a 33 year old male living with his mum, who has only had one short term relationship before me? Some insight would be great if anyone gets this far. "
Chhayagarh: I can't leave.,HFY,1gl0dac,2024-11-06 09:56:35,30,0.92,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gl0dac/chhayagarh_i_cant_leave/,BuddhaTheGreat,OC,"I tried to run. I know. Bad idea. But most of you haven’t felt what I felt that night. At least, I hope you haven’t. For your own sake.

There is little in the world that is more terrifying than your heart wrenching with fear as you lie in bed, drenched in your own sweat, eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling. Keenly aware of your own mortality. Any man, anyone, any living thing, would want to get away from anything that makes them feel that way. So, I ran.

Alright, I should probably slow down. Start where I left off [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gkowfm/chhayagarh_meet_the_family_and_the_monster/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

By the way, I thought I should provide you guys with an easy way to keep track of these experiences, if only to have a neat little log of my death throes. So, I made an [index](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/comments/1fqrllm/index_welcome_to_chhayagarh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on its own [dedicated subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/). I’ll keep updating it as and when I post, so check back every so often if you’re interested. In the meantime, if you want to discuss anything, feel free to drop a post or two there. I’ll try to be involved, provided I’m not actively in the jaws of some monstrosity at that point.

Anyway, after a refreshing afternoon siesta, it was time to meet my lawyer. I put on one of the clean white tunics the servants had left out while I was sleeping. As the evening fell, the air was growing chilly, and the wind was picking up across the open fields outside, so I had Bhanu bring me a shawl. Not carrying a good jacket or sweater had been an oversight. I had completely forgotten how cold it could get in these remote places at night, even outside of winter.

What I did not forget was to swipe Ramu’s knife off the table and stick it in one of my pockets. I was not making the mistake of being unarmed, even inside the house.

My uncle was waiting for me as I threw the shawl around my shoulders and descended the stairs. He was similarly dressed in a woollen shawl and a tunic, his smile in its usual place.

“Now you look the part, kid. All that shirt and jeans bullshit won’t fly in this house.”

I chuckled, picking at the edges of the shawl. “I almost feel like I belong here. Part of the scenery, you know? Almost.”

“Hey. This is your home.” He walked up and grabbed my shoulder. “That remains true, no matter how many years you spend away from it. Your father did what he thought was best when he left. I don’t blame him. But even he always felt its pull. Whenever something went wrong, he would be on his way here the next day. We never even needed to call. He just felt it, and he came back.”

“He came back. And he died.”

He nodded. “And he died.”

“What happened that night, *kaku*? I deserve to know.”

“You do.” He sighed and took his hand off my shoulder, turning his back to me. “But I cannot tell you. He never discussed it with me, though I asked. Not with any of us. Only your grandfather knows what truly happened. At least, he knew.”

“I see.”

“I’m sorry.” He looked back at me. “This place has painful connotations for you, as it has for all of us. You did not want to come back, and I can understand why. But you’re here now. And you’re family. Our family. All of us are with you. Whatever this is… we can handle it. We always have.”

I stepped closer to him. “Grandfather could not do it, and he knew this land from birth.”

“And through him, and us, so will you.” He faced me again. “On that note, we must speak soon. About the situation here. You’ve had enough excitement for one day, but tomorrow, come find me. There is information to cover. There are rituals to be performed. The coming of a new *Thakur* is a crucial time. Nothing can go wrong.”

“I don’t understand.”

“It’ll all make sense eventually. Trust me, kid.” He gestured at the hallway. “The lawyer’s in the study. You should go see him now. He’ll explain the mundane side of things to you. Property, finances. You know it better than me.”

“That makes one thing.” I sighed. “Thanks, uncle. By the way, where are the others?”

“My brothers? They’re out for tonight. Working. You’ll see them in the morning.” He gave me a small wave, nodding towards the study. “Go. Don’t want him to get mad.”

The study was exactly as I had left it in the vision. The only difference was the dust that hung like a thick pall over the room. Evidently, it had not been aired out or cleaned since the disappearance of its last owner. Mercifully, the power was on this time, so the chandelier-like light overhead was working, illuminating the room with a diffuse yellow glow.

A portly, balding man in a suit struggled out of one of the chairs when he saw me enter, extending a hand.

“Mr. Sen, so nice to finally meet you. My sincerest condolences about your grandfather.”

“Thank you.” I gestured at him to take his seat and took one of my own.

We faced each other across a small table.

“Mr. Sen, my name is Jacob Durham, of Durham and Co. Solicitors in Kolkata. I have worked closely with your grandfather for a long time. I was shocked to learn of his untimely demise. And in such a tragic manner too.”

I nodded. “It came as a shock to us all. Life has been a whirlwind ever since.”

“I imagine so.” He produced a briefcase from behind his chair and set it on the table. “Of course, the association between our firm and your family goes back much farther. We have worked with your estate for almost two centuries now, ever since 1825. My father, his father, and his father before him have all served your family. And now, I get to continue the line with you.”

“I understand you’re here with details about the inheritance.” I saw right through his attempts to create a sense of familiarity. It was a common trick of the trade. But with me, that relationship would have to be earned through competence.

“Indeed.” He sharply opened the briefcase and produced a few stacks of documents, lists, and diagrams. “I understand you are in our noble profession yourself. Good. Then this should not take as long as I feared.”

It still took several hours. I won’t bore you with the details, but it suffices to say that the implications are staggering. The manor and the surrounding lands were directly the personal possessions of the family, with some of it beyond the current boundaries leased out on long-term covenants to farmers. Beyond that, we held revenue rights and limited administrative rights over the entirety of the village land, as set out in the survey records he showed me. We also owned the forest behind the estate, as well as the mountain beyond it that served as the natural landmark before which Chhayagarh was built.

Okay, I should probably explain the forest. I told you the land was dry and hard, and that’s still true. But somehow, right at the base of the mountain, the place has managed to grow a lush, dense forest. Such vegetation density is not present anywhere else in the region. A part of the forest falls within our estate walls and contains the family grove, but most of it is outside, with only a narrow path winding through it to reach the steps that lead up the mountain. I theorize that the mountain caught what little rain the place gets and concentrated it there to allow the forest to grow, but knowing what I know now, there could have been some occult shit involved.

In any case, I found out that there were even more remote assets: townhouses in Kolkata and some other cities, satellite estates in the countryside, temple and shrine revenue, old hunting and lumber forests, business ventures, and even investment portfolios and commercial real estate. Even accounting for the maintenance and labour costs to keep everything functional, the property was raking in an absurd amount of money.

“Someone has been putting in the work to grow the pie,” I muttered, rifling through some deeds that described stakes in offshore oil blocks in the Americas.

“The family has been accumulating its assets for centuries, Mr. Sen. Usually, such estates lose a lot to mismanagement over the years, but I’m happy to report that such is not the case with yours.”

“A lot to keep track of.”

“I wouldn’t worry about it. Most of these assets are handled by a network of trusts and corporations with experienced administrators. Trustworthy ones. We have spent a lot of time perfecting the governance structure. I will send the documents over if you like, but the gist is that we can take care of maintaining and growing the estate. You need only decide how to best spend the windfall. Your family has always invested heavily in the village, both for welfare and other, more esoteric purposes. Those ones, I never fully understood.”

“You and me both, Mr. Durham. You and me both.”

He shrugged lightly. “I’m not paid to ask questions. In any case, if you ever need anything from the estate, let me know. We’ll make it happen.”

One of you had prompted me to think about the legal status of our *zamindari* all the way back in my first post, so I took the opportunity to pop the question.

“Ah.” Durham scratched his chin, smiling. “That’s a good question, Mr. Sen. Actually, there are laws on the books specifically about Chhayagarh, ever since the British administration. But we think these laws are based on even older laws. We have found *firmans* from the Sultans and the Mughals specifically protecting your family’s rights over this village, and decrees from the Hindu and Buddhist kings before them. They’re really obscure and difficult to retrieve. Almost redacted. But these laws all exempt this village from any land redistribution laws or other such measures. We keep checking periodically to see if all is in order, but in short, your family’s right over this inheritance is specifically and particularly protected by legislation. It has been so for as long as we have records.”

“Why were these laws passed?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“We are not aware. Maybe your family lobbied for them. Maybe the government had reasons of its own. Either way, the better for you and the worse for them.” He replaced the papers in his suitcase, leaving only a few out for me to sign. “Feel free to go through these. They will confirm the estate handover, the continuance of the governance structure, and other procedural things. All routine.”

It took about half an hour more until I was done reading and signing. Then Durham took the papers and replaced them in his case. Despite the name, he looked as native as I did, so I guessed he must have had some English blood somewhere up the tree.

“Now, as for the personal possessions your grandfather left you…” He rose to his feet and crossed over to a corner behind me. “Excuse me.”

When he returned, he held three parcels of varying sizes, as well as a sturdy wooden walking stick. “I had sealed these for safekeeping in my custody when I was instructed to, in accordance with your grandfather’s instructions. I warrant that no one has tampered with them since I retrieved them, though I cannot know what happened prior to my arrival.”

I nodded. He was a little too formal with me, given his advanced age. “So, these are the articles he left me?”

“Indeed. Firstly…” He handed me the stick. “Your grandfather’s walking stick. It has apparently been a long-time family heirloom, used by eight *Thakurs* before you. He wanted you to have it. Use it if you wish.”

I raised it to the light, studying it. I recognized the gnarly top, the darkish wood, and the simple metal tip at the bottom. Not just because I had seen it in that fateful vision. I remembered it well from my childhood: the telltale, comforting clacks echoing through the halls, indicating my grandfather on his regular rounds through the house.

“Then, we have this.” He opened one of the packages and handed me a gold-and-black ring, decorated with heraldry: a circular shield with a ribbon framing it, crossed over by a sword and a torch. Two lions held it up on either side. There was no motto.

“That is your family crest. This ring has been used as a symbol of office by the head of your family since time immemorial. I recommend you keep it and wear it all the time. It is both priceless and timeless.”

I slipped it onto my left index finger. It fit snugly; in fact, it may have been the light playing tricks on me, but I could have sworn I saw it shift and change size, adapting to my measurements.

“A natural fit. Truly, you boys are born into this role.” Durham gave me a polite smile, before moving on to the next package. “You own all the books in the family libraries and archives anyway, but your grandfather specifically insisted I hand this one over to your hands only. It took a while to track down. He had it in a bank locker all the way out in Singapore.”

He handed me a worn book. There was no title or name on the cover, but from looks alone, that was not surprising. It wasn’t a novel. It was a journal.

“This book was not listed in the preservation records of the family chronicles. I had no idea it even existed a few weeks ago, except that I perhaps saw your grandfather writing in it once. But that was many years ago.”

“What does it say?” I turned it around in my hands, hoping some clue would appear to explain it all. Unfortunately, there was nothing.

Durham gave me a crisp and incredulous laugh. “Mr. Sen, you must think me an amateur if you are implying that I would rifle through my client’s possessions. Please, find out at your own leisure. In any case…” He unwrapped the last package.

It revealed a simple golden necklace, completely unadorned. The pendant held nothing except one large, whitish stone. It was almost like a pearl, but the texture was off.

“What is that?” I raised an eyebrow.

“I have no idea. I only found out about it when your grandfather told me to secure it in his study after he was gone. He was extremely insistent that you wear it at all times.”

“This thing?” It did not go with my fashion at all, to be honest.

He shrugged again. “It’s yours now, Mr. Sen. Wear it. Kick it. Burn it. Your call. But he really was very insistent when he called me up about it, the night he disappeared.”

I perked up at that. “He called you that night?”

“Yes, shortly before he set out, from what I heard. That’s when he told me to facilitate the transfer of the estate to you and hold onto these articles. For if… when something happened.”

“He knew? That he was going to…”

“He said it was a possibility.” Durham sighed. “Your grandfather did this often, you know. Planning for his own death. It wasn’t even the first time this year that I had received such a call. I know he did something dangerous. Something to do with this place. But he never let me in on the details. I never thought… I never thought it would be real this time.” He sighed again, pressing his fingers to his temples.

“Sounds like you were really close.” More to placate him than anything else, I slipped on the necklace right then and there. “I’m sorry.”

“Family is family, Mr. Sen. Your loss far outstrips mine.” He got to his feet, slowly buttoning his coat. “Now, it is getting rather late. That more or less concludes our business. If you have any more questions, I am here till tomorrow afternoon. If there’s something after that, well… I’m always just a phone call away. Though your grandfather preferred his letters. Either works for me.”

I got to my feet as well, and we shook hands. “Good night, Mr. Durham, and thank you. For everything.”

After this, dinner was another blur. Durham took his food in his room, I was told. I talked with my grandmother and uncle. Just polite chitchat, nothing important. I think paying some compensation to Ramu’s father was discussed. My uncle said he would take care of it. Servants were whirling in and out, replacing dishes and utensils. But my mind was elsewhere. On the ring, on the book, on the necklace. On the walking stick, of all things.

Why did my grandfather think I needed to have these things? And these things in particular?

Despite my curiosity, I found quickly that I was in no condition to burn the midnight oil. My eyes began drooping almost as soon as I entered the bedroom. The day had taken its toll. The journal would have to wait for tomorrow, I told myself. I took the ring off and placed it on the nightstand, alongside the knife. I was about to do the same with the necklace, but as soon as I touched the clasp, my fingers tingled. A sense of impending danger stabbed into my skull like a knife. I decided to leave it where it was.

Thank the gods for that.

It was late when I snapped awake.  The power had gone out again, but the room was still cool. The nights could get downright chilly here. That was not something to be concerned about.

What was concerning was that it was getting colder, and fast. My breath was beginning to mist, and the metal bedframe was icy to the touch. The cold was almost alive, malicious even, as it wormed its way deep into my body. I had never experienced it myself, but I imagined this is what people who fell into frozen lakes felt. Cold, deeper and stronger than anything they had ever felt before.

My joints barely moved, as if stuck in jelly. Soon, frost began to form on the ceiling, slowly inching its way outwards and down the walls.

The only warm thing in the room was the necklace. Hell, it was scorching, like an open flame against my collarbone. At that moment, I was almost afraid I would soon start smelling burning flesh. Heat and cold. What a way to die.

The same overwhelming sense of danger stabbed over and over into my brain, seeming to point towards the only window in the room. It was on the far wall from the door, behind and to the side of the bed. Slowly, forcing my neck to work through the chill, I turned my head to look at it.

The room I had been furnished with had no balcony of its own. The only thing outside that window was a thin ledge, mostly decorative, though workers could attach scaffolding to it if they needed to do repairs. At the moment, no repairs are required.

But all the same, there was a face pressed against the window. A pale woman with long dark hair cascading past her shoulders. She had a small smirk on her face, staring right at me through the glass. The stabbing pain in my head reached a new fever pitch. The necklace positively throbbed with heat, in tune with my quickening heartbeat.

The window was locked, held in place by two heavy deadbolts. For now, those seemed to be in place. The woman had noticed my gaze upon her. Her smirk split into a full-on smile and she leaned closer and planted a small kiss on the glass. Frost radiated outwards from her lips, crackling as it spread.

I could feel my pupils dilate in panic. The cold was reaching an intolerable level now, deadening every inch of skin. I tried to sit up, but my muscles were spasming, working slowly and hesitantly. Or not at all.

The window was completely frosted now, with only a translucent outline of the woman outside visible. I saw her raise her hand and touch it.

Then, the thick glass exploded inwards, scattering shards all over the floor. The cool night air blew in, chilling the air even more. Along with it came thick, billowing mist, covering the floor and furniture until it looked more like a swamp than a room.

A bare, slender leg extended through the ragged hole in the window, almost gingerly stepping into the mist. The cold went up another few notches. My teeth were chattering uncontrollably, and every muscle was frozen to a standstill. I had little choice but to keep watching as the rest of her body followed, twisting like a serpent as it passed through the narrow opening. Frost began to climb up the bed and onto my mattress.

She was tall and lithe, her jet-black hair falling over her face and all the way to the floor. The only things visible were one unblinking eye, and that smile. She was clad only in a simple white *sari,* without a blouse in the traditional village style. Her bare abdomen was as pale as her face, almost chalk-white. I had heard female monsters and ghosts had their feet twisted around to face backwards, but her bare feet were as normal and unremarkable as mine.

Not that kind of monster, then.

Slowly, she stalked over to the bed. With every step closer, the cold settled deeper and deeper into my flesh. My eyes began to struggle to stay open. Frost was climbing onto my hands and feet now. I tried to open my mouth and scream for help, but my jaw might as well have been wired shut. The only thing that escaped my throat was a pathetic gasp. Even the stabbing warnings in my head had faded to a dull, meaningless roar.

Dimly, I felt her climb onto the bed, straddling me as she leaned closer and closer. Her fingers were colder than I even thought possible, as they gently wrapped around my chin and turned my face to gaze into hers.

“My, my, how you’ve grown.”

Her voice was low and rich, slippery like black ice. I felt my skin burn as frost spread from her fingers. I was practically hyperventilating now, rooted in place and helpless, but even that was growing difficult. My chest refused to rise. Breathing was becoming a struggle.

A losing struggle.

She let go of my face, running her hands teasingly over my biceps. They left a trail of chilling pins and needles.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to kill you. Not for now.”

She placed both hands on my chest, squeezing lightly. Some of the cold withdrew. I could almost breathe again. My eyes flitted between her gaze and the knife on the table. Only if I could somehow get to it…

“Stabbing a visitor? Now, now. That’s so rude.” This close, her eyes were a deep, almost blackish blue, like the dark underbellies of arctic oceans. “If I wanted to harm you, do you think I would have got past the defences so easily? Do you think I would have let you wake up at all?”

My voice was still non-functional, but she must have glimpsed the question in my gaze.

*“Why are you here, then?”*

“Why? To help you, of course. I’m your friend, *Thakur*. Don’t you remember? We’ve been friends for a long time.”

The frost was climbing up my arms, but even through the haze of cold, I recalled a few half-forgotten snatches. A pale face watching from the edge of the wall as I ran around the courtyard. Tossing a ball back and forth with a smiling woman in a white *sari*. Holding a pale hand as I trampled through the family grove.

Had she been this cold then too?

“Good friends correct each other when they’ve been bad.” Almost sensually, she drew herself across me, reaching with a slender hand towards the table and grasping the ring in two fingers. “You know nothing of Chhayagarh’s ways. In many ways, you’re still that little boy, ignorant of the world and its dangers. Only this time, the dangers actually exist, and they want your head. The old things of this world hold no grudges for the innocent transgressions of children. But you are a child no longer.”

She nestled closer, almost lying on top of me as she ran a lazy finger over my brow. Even though it was somewhat reduced, the cold was still barely survivable. An involuntary squeak escaped me.

“Your actions, your presence. They have weight. Meaning. And that makes them both dangerous and attractive. So, when you know nothing about your situation, it’s best to trust wise counsel.” She reached down and grabbed my left hand by the wrist, raising it so I could see as she deliberately placed the ring onto my index finger. “Wear the ring. At. All. Times.” She deliberately lingered on every word. “I believe that is what he told you, darling.”

As soon as it settled on my finger, the cold no longer had a hold on me. The stabbing in my head stopped. I could breathe freely again. Move freely. I tried to snatch my arm out of her grasp, but even at my full strength, she was far stronger.

She smirked at my attempts, continuing in a sultry lilt. “Cute. Your family name, its symbols, have power here. Power earned from a violent history. The things here have learned to fear that crest, even if they don’t fear its holder. It will protect you from the worst of it, until you can protect yourself. Remember that.”

She leaned down and kissed my forehead. Her lips were colder than anything I had ever felt, or probably will ever feel for the rest of my life. Frost spread at a blinding speed from them, growing and thickening until they covered my eyes with a solid, opaque mask.

“Good night, little boy. Sleep well. I’ll be watching you.”

Even blind, I felt her presence shift and leave the room. A few seconds later, the frost over my face cracked, disappearing in moments like quicksilver. The room was back to its normal temperature again, the frost gone. Even the window had been repaired, the pieces held together by a meticulous webbing of ice.

For what felt like years, I lay in that bed. Despite the cool weather, sweat poured freely until the mattress was damp. I tried to cry, but even the tears wouldn’t come. I was too terrified for that.

Then, just as suddenly, I bolted upright and got to my feet. I pulled on a shirt, leaving everything else where it was. Packing and taking the luggage would arouse suspicion.

I had to go. Now.

The house was dark and empty when I left the room, with only the knife in my pocket. The servants were all in the outer part of the manor. Asleep. Only the family slept in the inner bedrooms. Neither my uncle nor my grandmother had been woken by the commotion.

Good.

No one noticed me leave the house. No one noticed as I crossed over the vast estate and silently slid out of the gate. Even the *lathials* were asleep in these wee hours, hugging their sticks to their chests. I had no idea how long it took to walk from the house to the edge of the village. It was a dazed blur. My head was empty of any thought, any instinct, except the feeling that I had to get away. I saw only the road in front of me. I felt only the steady thuds of my feet hitting the ground. I had forgotten to get my shoes. I was still in my house slippers.

Damn it.

A few villagers saw me, mostly young ones out with friends for late-night camaraderie. A few curious looks. But no one stopped or questioned me.

Perhaps they, too, were afraid of the ring. Or it might have been the blank stare.

It only felt like seconds later that the tea shop and the road loomed into view, the familiar pillars opposite it denoting the bus stop. It was not dawn yet, but the sky was beginning to lighten. The shop was still closed and shuttered. It probably would not open for a few days now.

Despite that, the bus driver was outside, sipping tea from a flask on one of the benches. He looked up when I approached. Unlike last time, he was wearing sunglasses that covered his eyes.

“Hey, kiddo. I ended up staying the night. There were no more passengers on the route.”

“Why are you wearing glasses?” I managed. “Something wrong with your eyes?”

He lowered them a little to stare at me, letting me see the inky darkness. “Just a fashion choice. You people are not the only ones who like to dress up. But what about you? Going somewhere?”

“When do you leave?”

He looked at his bus, still parked in the same spot. “In a few hours, I suppose. Why?”

“Take me with you. Take me back. I can’t stay here.” I clenched my fists, nails digging into my palms. “I can’t.”

He looked at me for a few heartbeats. “No.”

“No? What do you mean, no?”

“You can’t leave. Not now.”

“I’ll pay you. How much do you want?” I clenched so hard that the nails drew blood. “Hell, I’ll give you the entire estate if you want. Just get me out of here!”

“Tempting. But you shouldn’t make offers like that lightly. You have no idea of what you may end up giving away.”

“Look—”

“Ssh!” He raised a finger to his lips. “Stop talking. You can feel it, can’t you?”

“Feel what?”

No sooner had the question left my lips than I felt what he was referring to. That sense I was slowly becoming familiar with. Dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of eyes. Unseen. All fixed on me.

“The coming of a new *Thakur* is a momentous time. A crucial upheaval, especially in circumstances like yours.” He lowered his hand, taking another sip of the tea. “The land bucks like an unruly horse. Old boundaries, old laws, old understandings, all become ephemeral. They are watching you. All of them. Human and inhuman alike. Getting your measure. If you try to run now… They will know you as a coward. Forever.”

“Better that than knowing me as a dead man.”

He sighed. “You don’t understand, do you? For now, the reputation, the legend around you, keeps the smart ones among them at bay. If you shatter that image, they’ll pounce. You get on that bus with me, and you won’t live to see the next village.”

My heart skipped a beat at those words. “But… you can hold them off, can’t you? Like you did with the Spirals?”

“Maybe. There are many fish in this ocean, and though I don’t mean to brag, I’m one of the bigger ones. But a favour costs nothing. On the other hand, seeking my help yourself? Asking for it when I don’t mean to provide it? That’s a different thing altogether. That kind of support does not come cheap. There will be a bargain, and you won’t like what I take. But even if you agree, even if I help you, even if you escape…” He sipped casually at the tea again. “There will be consequences.”

“That’s what you keep saying.” I wanted to get pissy again, but I remembered the cloaked man’s warning. These things were quick to anger, and slow to forgiveness. “But what do you mean by that?”

“You have no idea of the power you hold, do you? The *Thakur* is not just the lord of Chhayagarh, kiddo. He is its protector. More importantly, he is its gaoler.”

“Protector? Gaoler?” When one asks for an answer, one does not mean to be confused even more by it. But I refrained from making those feelings known to him.

“It is by your strength, your presence, your actions, that this world draws strength against the other one. This village sits on ancient land, where monsters crawl out of the crevices and morasses beyond the veil. It is powerful beyond reckoning, even to existences like mine.” He finished his tea and set the cup aside.

“That is why your family was given this village, young lord. Since your first generations, you have served to stem the tide, to hold fast against the horrors that stalk in the night, to intercede and mediate and solve disputes on the boundaries where the real and unreal collide. Just by being here, you shore up the defences. You keep those who wish to hurt at bay, and you give those who wish to help a focus to rally behind. And you hold up the boundaries that keep them on this land. You disallow their escape. You prevent them from tormenting the rest of the world.”

“Our family? Why us?” I managed to stammer out.

There were a thousand questions running through my mind, but that one came hurtling out before all the others. It was a selfish one. But be honest. Could you really blame me for being angry at being saddled with such a responsibility out of the blue?

“That, I cannot say. But I know it is your sworn duty. You are dam, bridge, and fortress against the other side. If you leave now, when your influence is at its weakest… the walls will break down. Your power will collapse. Your family, everyone in the village, will be left unprotected. And the slaughter won’t stop with them. It will carry on. It will swallow village after village, town after town, city after city. Thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions will die. And death is one of the better outcomes in this situation. There are things that can do worse.”

“Can’t anyone else stop them?”

“There are others, like you, out there. More competent ones. I’m sure they will eventually get it under control. But are you sure you want to be responsible for whatever happens in the meantime?”

I staggered over and collapsed on the bench beside him, burying my head in my hands. I tried to say a million things, but only one choked phrase made it out.

“I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do.”

“Go back, kiddo. Get some sleep.”

The sky was beginning to lighten to a faded blue by now. Dawn was coming.

“It was a mistake to come here in the first place. They have smelled weakness. Don’t make it worse by letting them see your tears. The day is safer, especially now that you have the ring. Go back now, before anyone notices you’re missing.” He screwed the cap back onto the flask and rose to his feet, starting towards the bus. “Best of luck. You’ll need it.”

I raised my head, watching his rapidly retreating figure disappear into the driver’s cabin. A few moments later, his head poked out of the window.

“Oh, cheer up. I’ll bring you something nice from my next trip to town. No charge.”

After he drove off, I got to my feet and headed back to the manor. The sun was almost halfway over the horizon when I made it to my room. I tried to go to sleep, but my eyes just wouldn’t close anymore. So, I got back up and typed this out. I can hear people beginning to stir in the house, now that it’s dawn.

I don’t know how much of what the bus guy told me is correct or completely accurate. But in case even a sliver of it is true, I can’t take the chance. There is no way I can leave. At least, not until I figure this place out and stop whatever is hunting us. Both the woman and the driver (I suppose I should call him the ferryman, shouldn’t I?) said that fear of our family keeps the things here in line. Well, whatever this creature is, it isn’t afraid of us.

I have no heir yet. If it kills me too, if no one is left to carry the family line forward…

I don’t know what happens. But it can’t be good.

As I write these last few lines, I can feel a little bit of drowsiness coming back to me. Just as well. I think I’ll sleep in for a bit, and have a late breakfast. Grandmother would be disappointed, but I have little choice in the matter.

After all, I have a long day ahead.

I said, ""Sure."" I posted flyers for the program. I got an email from a Sean Stapleton attacking myself and my program. The police showed up saying they had gotten a complaint. They started off by saying that were I doing the program they had no problem with it. They just wanted to know if I was posting the flyers or if the flyers were part of the long standing criminal harassment of myself by people who have been attacking myself and others for decades. I confirmed I posted the flyers. The mother brought her kid. They had a swell time. Today on reddit I found a post anonymously attacking myself for offering this program at m ""illegal"" cinema. The CineForum is not a cinema. A Forum is a platform for ideas. My work in Toronto has been under attack since it started in the mid 1960s. In THE TORONTO star David Beard stated, ""Reg Hartt is under financed, overworked and snubbed.  should be paying tribute to him."" in 2000 I watched the owner of a street poster service paste a three page attack on myself. I laughed. I did not laugh when in 2010 the city was wall papered with thousands of anonymous flyers targeting a former employee of the man as a rat (police informant). This was ironic. The target had been attacked on the street from behind. He was beaten so badly he had to go to a hospital. The assault was witnessed by a police officer who begged him to press charges. The targeted person said, ""I'm not a rat."" He wasn't. I bought my first video camera. I recorded the posters. Mayor David Miller's office got them stopped. In 2012 I found myself the target of anonymous slander saying I was creating and distributing child porn. Oliver Moore did a story on this which was published in THE GLOBE AND MAIL. To read it google ""Reg Hartt, Oliver Moore, The Globe and Mail."" Another ex-employee of the man posting the flyers was also targeted  as was then Councillor Adam Vaughan and Mayor Rob Ford. Both myself and the new target were informed by people they had been offered money to kill us. This has been going on for far too long. The comments on the current post are uninformed and ugly. One person commented I serve pasta with no name sauce (I don't but if I do, so what?). Walking in my door Ed Keenan of THE STAR said, ""Reg Hartt, you are the only man in Toronto who stands up."" I said, ""I'm not but there are ever enough."" In a piece on my work THE MONTREAL GAZETTE stated, ""Reg Hartt is one of Canada's  foremost film archivists, lecturers and programmers.""

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford recently came to the rescue of Reg Hartt, an individual who had run afoul of the law. Hartt’s violation? As explained by city authorities, he was illicitly running “a place of assembly.” Hartt’s actual crime? He is a non-conformist in a city that makes just about all commercial activities illegal, including those in the home, unless some city bureaucrat says otherwise.

Hartt has been a credit to Toronto for decades. His Cineforum, which screens noteworthy films for small study groups in his living room, has long won acclaim from critics in Canada and abroad and endorsements from Canadian icons such as author Pierre Berton and urban guru Jane Jacobs.  Lonely Planet lists 463 Bathurst St, his modest abode on a major Toronto thoroughfare, as among the top 30 sights to see in Toronto and in the top 30 of sights to see in Ontario. That’s quite a credit to the city. Yet although neighbours don’t complain, the city’s Municipal Licensing and Standards department periodically shuts him down.

“I am a friend of Reg Hartt.

“I mean that, where you have style wrapped around content and tied with a ribbon of beat improvisation, there you have angels.  
“Harvey Pekar was an angel.  
“And I’ve never met anyone with wings who did not have an ego. Nor is this an easy town for a man who is larger than life, and does not care to suffer fools.  
“You might like to know that the friends of Reg Hartt included the non-fool-suffering Jane Jacobs, who knew a thing or two about what, and who, makes life worth living in the city; that’s good enough for me. His philosophy as a teacher of film? “My programs are designed for people without money.” Yeah, but how does he earn enough to pay the rent? “The Lord said, ‘I will take care of you.’ The I Ching says the same thing.” A long time since I met anyone who throws those bones.

The city will do what it will.

And you will permit me an observation: if Martin Sheen can come to town and stand on the picket line with striking hotel workers, why won’t our senior cineastes stand up for Reg Hartt, as the city moves to strike him down?

Paul McGrath, THE GLOBE AND MAIL  
Some audience members were visibly distressed by the frequency and force of Hartt’s interjections into the program but it is clearly his chosen way of doing things, and the payoff in information is worth it. He has many good stories to tell: about Oswald the Lucky Rabbit’s transformation into Mickey Mouse, Disney’s most enduring character; about the furor that greeted the creation of Tweety Pie, which subsided only when the artists painted him yellow; and much valuable technical information for the animation students. He has some interesting tales about Mel Blanc, Warners’ resident genius of voice characterization, as he continues the series with a full scale look at the Warner work of Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, and others. It’s the best work of its kind you will see anywhere because, except in rare oases in the United States and Eastern-Europe, they don’t make them like that anymore.

JULIA SCUTARU, retired journalist, Bucharest, Romania: “In Toronto, I discovered by chance, Cineforum. Pure chance but a fortunate one. In that small room exhaling culture, passion and dedication, I watched the movie TRIUMPH OF THE WILL, an important historical, political and social document., and real artistic achievement….As a journalist (in Romania) I worked in the cultural field, including film reviews. Therefore I came to the Cineforum not just as a movie lover, but as a knowledgeable professional…We live in an era authoritatively dominated by brainwashing and political correctness…I admired Reg Hartt’s courage and passion put in searching out and defending the human truth, the artistic truth, the historical truth; the Truth and unveiling it…Discovering Reg Hartt and his Cineforum was one of the most important events of my visit in Toronto.”

DAVID BEARD, owner CINEBOOKS, quoted in THE TORONTO STAR, Nov. l, l979  
“This man has devoted his whole life to bringing the film classics to the public. He treats animation-cartoons, if you will-as art. He is underfinanced, overworked and snubbed. I think we should pay tribute to him.""

  
This won't of course stop the slanderers. Drop by The CineForum. Brit painter Peter Moore called it ""The most perfect place on earth in which to see a movie.""

-CASE-

On July 31, 2001 at about 2:50 p.m., the wrapped body of a 13 to 16-year-old girl, weighed down by a parasol stand, floated in the Main River near Frankfurt-Nied.

The autopsy had revealed that the unknown girl had been severely physically abused over a long period of time and had died as a result of massive violence to her abdomen and chest.

Numerous cigarette burns were covering her entire body and she had numerous oblong scars on her forehead, torso and legs. There were also several lacerations on her head. She had been submerged in water for 12-24 hours, although maybe up to 3 days.

There were indications of possible sexual abuse.

The body was wrapped in a brownish comforter cover with a leopard pattern and a terrycloth sheet. The girl's legs were bent and pressed to her chest, her arms close to her body. In this squatting position, the girl's body was wrapped and knotted with textile straps up to 10 cm wide.

The wrapped corpse was tied together with a white textile ribbon and tied to a parasol stand with a purple striped ribbon. These textile straps are known as nalas.

These are used in Pakistani, Afghan and some Indian cultures as a belt for tying pluderhosen. In India, the nala is only worn by women, in Pakistan and Afghanistan by women in predominantly bright colors and by men, mostly in white.

it is assumed that the girl originated from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area, but was living in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area, perhaps as a domestic servant. However, on-site investigation revealed no clues about her identity or that of her killer(s). It cannot be excluded that the girl entered through diplomatic circles, in which investigations are difficult due to political immunity. The body was buried in the Heiligenstock cemetery; the funeral was financed by donations from the investigators

"Final Budget Breakdown (SLC, UT - July 2024 - $13k - approx. 75 guests - Saturday)",Weddingsunder10k,1gg3dlo,2024-10-30 21:42:10,35,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1gg3dlo/final_budget_breakdown_slc_ut_july_2024_13k/,10k-or-bust,,"Hi everyone - while I no longer spend much time on reddit I did want to share our final wedding budget breakdown. This subreddit showed me how much was possible. We did not end up under 10k... but we did splurge very intentionally. I'm including where friends/family stepped in! The biggest help was when my parents offered to split our total food bill 50/50 and cover mocktails so we could extend our guest list (including some family friends they wanted to have present).

**Photos:** [https://imgur.com/a/FXOhpDF](https://imgur.com/a/FXOhpDF)

**Food & Drinks: $5,895.82++**

* Reception at Silver Fork Lodge: $5,736.56. Includes staffing fee, gratuity, 74 guests, 5 hours of non-alcoholic open bar, BBQ menu. If you live in SLC, I highly recommend them as a venue. The food was spectacular and they worked very closely with us with our drink requests (we had two mocktail recipes they blew out of the water and two non-alcoholic beers they tracked down for us... including one in which they found six different suppliers because no one in the valley had more than a handful available).
* Wedding cake: $156.26. From local bakery - purchased three single tier cakes in increasing sizes and placed onto cake stand with grocery store raspberries. It disappeared FAST and guests were inspired to go buy seconds at the bakery the next day
* Pre-ceremony Picnic Lunch from Harmons grocery store: n/a. Covered by my mum, and she way overestimated because the groom's side of the family did not end up joining us for this portion of the day. Definitely not part of your traditional wedding but great to see all my out of country family and out of state friends. Sandwich, dessert, and fruit platters from local slightly-upscale grocery chain.
* Pre-ceremony Picnic Drinks from Costco: n/a. Covered by my MIL, number of drinks were way overestimated but the weather was much much cooler than the weekend before.
* Rehearsal dinner: n/a. 10 people, covered by our best man as his wedding present to us when he realized how stressed I was about it. We went to a local Indian restaurant used to larger crowds and ordered family style.

**Photography: $2,158.97**

* Burlap and Blossom: $1837.22. All day coverage and tip. Gabby is amazing. Just check out the photos linked at the bottom.
* Engagement photos: $321.75. Also from burlap and blossom. This allowed us to check we liked her work and that my make-up skills and style left me happy with the results in photos. Completely worth the splurge.

**Groom Outfit: $1,613.75**

* 3 Piece Custom Suit & White Shirt: $1,482.56. Used Tailor Cooperative in SLC. They were wonderful to work with. We used Black Friday to purchase gift cards and saved \~25% off the sticker cost. This was a complete splurge but my husband didn't own many nice clothes and it was a super fun experience for a suit he'll wear again and again as we enter the wedding years of our friends. (We used it pre-wedding for a friend's wedding already.)
* Shoes (Nordstrom): $75.40
* Tie (tiebar.com): $34.14
* Dry Clean: $21.65

**Bride Outfit: $711.77**

* Dress: $160. Highly recommend Brides for a Cause if you are on the west coast. It was 100% worth the drive down to Seattle from Vancouver, BC for me. My sister joined me on a visit to see me, we left without the dress, and then I returned three weeks later having made up my mind. I asked for a discount due to some black streaks on the skirt. It was a sample dress donated by the dress shop - original tag showed a cost of \~$1600. I specifically did not want a new dress. This was one area where I wanted to reduce consumption for a single use garment.
* Hemming all three skirt layers and removing train: $285. My mom covered this for me. I did not shop around as much as I should have due to wedding planning fatigue when this came up on the to-do list.
* Dry cleaning dress: $69.84. We also received quotes up to $200 before actually showing up with the dress. My dress is exceedingly simple but don't be caught by surprise if you get high quotes. I highly recommend showing the dress if its a simple one because ""wedding dress"" covers a very very wide range of dresses.
* Fancy white silk scarf: $106.83. Complete splurge at Nordstrom... I didn't even end up wearing it but it was to be my ""warm"" shoulder cover if the evening got chilly. I love it and have no regrets.
* Shoes: $45.00. Purchased by my mom on impulse fairly early on. She was adamant I not just wear white flats due to the 12 inch height difference with my husband. I let her win that one.
* Strapless swimsuit for tanning: $21.55. Because I refused to have tan lines. From Target. I wore long sleeves or strapless tops all summer.
* Miscellaneous shipping/parking costs from dress shopping: $19.00

**Ceremony Venue: $614.00**

* Storm Mountain Amphitheatre: $314.00. Two four hour blocks reserved immediately as they became available 12-months ahead of time. Each included 10 parking spots for guests and there was free street parking for others
* Helpers: $300. $20/hour for two friends to help us set-up and take-down our picnic lunch and minor decorations. They were colleagues that had turned into friends by the wedding. We ended up extending an invitation for them to attend the reception as guests. It was wonderful to have two people we could send to help load cars, pick up the wedding cake, etc.

**Decor: $526.98++**

* Flowers: $75. Trader Joe's purchase by my mom the day before - I wanted white and green colors with eucalyptus and baby's breath. She delivered based off what looked best. Turns out one of the family friends was a professional florist in a past life. We had no idea but she immediately volunteered to make the bridal bouquet and mini centerpieces and made a greenery garland for the reception. I was blown away. My MIL made the boutonniere for her son.
* Cake Stand and Tea-Honey Box: $275.64. This was a complete splurge to have an actual craftsperson (Seven Boughs out of Oregon) hand make both these objects. I hope to resell the cake stand post honey-moon. Think of the wine box & love letter tradition - we simply made it non-alcoholic with tea brick and super fancy honey.
* Bud vases: $60.00. Purchased by the mother because she didn't like the ones I found. Returned mine for full refund.
* Cork tiles & easel stand: $45.49. Amazon purchase for seating chart.
* Printing costs: $0.85 + $2.25 + $27.02. I designed menu table-tents, fake post-cards for the seating chart, and misc other things. This was to help the significant number of guests that had little spoken English follow along.
* Canva subscription: $15.00. I was using the free trial but forget to cancel so renewed one month. Completely worth it if you are inclined to design your own things.
* IKEA curtain rod: $15.00. To hide ugly wooden board at ceremony.
* Ribbons & bouquet supplies: n/a. Unknown, purchased by family friend and mother. \~<$20
* Home Depot supplies for A-frame sign: n/a. Unknown, purchased by my father because I had forgotten my wallet at the time. \~20$. Remember that home depot has discount wood for various flaws. I stole white spray paint and electrical tape from my work. The sign functioned at the entrance to point people down the path.
* Miscellaneous items I got for free: Stools (from home, IKEA), table tent holders (from a friend clearing her own wedding supplies), ""LOVE"" sign (from my mom, garage sale $1 purchase), NP Postcards for table numbering (reuse from my souvenir stash), white curtains (made by MIL using excess quilt fabric she'll be reusing), seating chart background (reuse of a JMT map we had floating around the house). The NP theme for the seating chart was unplanned - I simply was looking for inspiration amidst things I already had! Same with using green - it's the color the venue used for their linens and I wasn't about to upgrade.

**Rings: $420.23.** By McKay Diamond Company in SLC. My husband used his dad's ring and I had them make a custom ring using family gold and a tiny diamond in a tension setting.

**Gifts: $357.03 + $213.88.** $357 was for friends and helpers, including everyone we asked to give speeches and readings. Nothing was wedding themed and we tried to get things each individual would like (from a marathon day snack/electrolyte kit to a nursing badge to date night gift cards). The $215 was for our two sets of parents who we gifted metal photo prints of family photos (us from engagement shoot, them, and our siblings - so three prints each.)

**Hair and Make-Up: $178.31**. $125 was for hair cuts for both of us a few weeks before at my favorite salon. The rest is either miscellaneous hair bands/elastics/rollers or minor make up purchases. Don't forget to ask on Buy Nothing for make up.

**Transportation: $61.07.** Some gas, some Uber, some parking.

**Ceremony Booklets: $69.78.** Includes the super fancy paper I used and printing costs from our local library. I designed these in Canva.

**Marriage license: $55.00.** There was no additional cost to have our friend officiant be a ""County Designee"".

**Thank you cards: $100.00 ish.** This includes postage. The Shutterfly cards were about $70.

**A few miscellaneous notes:**

* I used YNAB for tracking purchases. (With some minor challenges with currency changes when I moved back to the US from Canada mid-planning that I tracked separately because I'm a spreadsheet person.. if you haven't been able to tell...) It's my favorite personal finance app and I love their method.  It's been very freeing.
* I fully recommend spending some time listening to the podcast: The Unconventional Wedding Podcast. She's absolutely marvelous and her podcast is the reason I didn't feel the need to have the same wedding I see on social media. My husband and I got ready together at home, we didn't have bridesmaid/groomsmen and avoided all associated drama, etc. Everyone loved the simplicity of the day.
* Don't be afraid to ask friends and family for help. But do not press when someone (such as your violinist younger sister, your shy friend) is uncomfortable helping. They may be willing to help in other ways.
* I am the planner between my husband and I. I did a lot of the planning but he took over the final week due to having added time off. The ability to let go and focus on work and seeing all our friends again (some for the first time since before COVID) the week of the wedding was extraordinarily helpful.
* Our guest list grew over the 18 months we were engaged due to a planned move to a new city mid-planning and new friends and colleagues. We did two rounds of invites and then sent a handful more to new friendships in the weeks before the wedding as we got final ""no"" RSVP's. I think I could have skipped inviting a handful of coworkers in the end to limit costs.

**Friend help - including the challenges of using friends and not vendors:**

**DJ/MC**: A friend who recently switched from engineering to musician to outdoor bike/ski guide brought his electric piano and Amazon-rented a battery to play entrance music for our ceremony. Technically did not follow the rules of our ceremony venue but we decided to go for it to have 5 minutes of live piano music... he organized and set up all on his own and was super excited to help out. The same friend functioned as our MC/DJ for the reception and had a blast. He made our cocktail playlist and dinner playlist and we collab'd on a dance playlist (all using Spotify). he also helped edit the first dance songs to shorten them - it was seamless and magic. He made all the announcements (cake cutting, dancing, tables for buffet) and called people up for speeches. He was the one who worked with venue to set up laptop/microphone ahead of everyone arriving to the reception venue. It was an amazing help. Definitely recommend finding a trusted friend to MC the reception even if you don't find a true DJ/plan to use Spotify. I was slightly stressed when he was a little procrastination prone - we didn't get playlists until 10 days before. But I also went to grad school with him and he always finished his homework assignments before me and organized our internet for our shared house. So I held myself back from bugging him.

**Officiant**: My husband's best friend was our officiant. We had no groomsmen/bridesmaids because we had no desire to single friends out. (We did ask our close friends and families to give toasts or readings depending on their preference.) We wrote out the ceremony script together using bits and pieces found online. It ended up more contentious than expected due to his lack of communication while he was in school. It turned out okay but strained my friendship with him. We used the county process to register him as a ""Designee"" rather than having him ordained by an online church - simply because I feel weird about ""religious"" institutions existing just to circumvent these rules... he did a great job running the ceremony part of the day and we have no regrets looking back. The same friend has greater means than us and came two weeks early due to a break-up and a desire to help us (partially as distraction from said break-up). He rented an airbnb and basically covered all our groceries for those two weeks. He cooked us breakfast the morning of and took us out to eat multiple times during the final stretch. I am exceedingly grateful even if we had to sit down and discuss how that level of generous help was a little uncomfortable for me to accept. This same friend also booked a large airbnb for all our friends who were still living a student life style and ended up not letting any of them pay them back. (It was a total $700 for a place with space for 14 people for three nights. It ended up being a fun surprise that so many of our single friends ended up there and all got very close due to it. We hung out with a group of about 20 friends after the wedding reception until 2 am playing games and all drinking (except my sober husband and I). I highly recommend something like this if you can find a way to make it work.)

**Set-Up:** A close friend of mine who did not want to stand in front of a crowd to do a reading/toast accepted to leave the ceremony prior to family/friend group photos with her partner and complete set up at the ceremony. She borrowed my car for the day to avoid using a rental. (Not everything was exactly as I envisioned, but she got it almost perfect.) I drew out a floor plan with notes on where I wanted everything and what was her responsibility and the venue's responsibility. I sent it to both parties a couple months ahead of time. Note that I also gave everyone a printed packing list and schedule of events at the rehearsal (copies of what I had sent digitally ahead of time) so everyone knew what items where in whose possession at all points of the day.

**Hair:** A friend of my husband, who lived locally unlike many of our guests, offered to do my hair. She did an amazing job but note that we practiced styles on three different occasions and I went in with almost no expectations. (She actually did the Pinterest searching for me based on her known abilities until I found styles I liked in her screenshots.) She came over the morning of to do my hair, bringing hot chocolate for me since I'm not a caffeine person) before returning home to get her 9-month old and 2-year old ready for the wedding. Aka, superhero. The same friends completely unexpectedly cleaned out entire one bedroom apartment the day after our wedding. (And were a little upset they didn't realize we were spending our wedding night at home and therefore in our extremely messy apartment filled with the wedding things we unloaded at 3 am...) \[My husband and I learned how to do his curls in foam rollers overnight with tips from our hair salon stylist and the internet.\]

**Car Decoration:** A high school friend packed chalk markers with her and had 6-8 friends help decorate my dad's BMW Z4 (with hard won permission) for my husband and I to drive between ceremony and reception... they even tied cans to the back. It was beautiful artwork and the only thing that didn't get photographed super well. They did it between picnic and ceremony in the ceremony venue parking lot. (My dad proceeded to drive this car back to LA from SLC without washing... wondering why he was getting honked at the entire time lmao.

**The joint bachelorette/bachelor party story.**

About 8 months before the wedding I was feeling very down that not having any bridesmaids meant no one was thinking of throwing me a pre-wedding party of any kind. My then-fiancé encouraged me to reach out to friends and talk about it. They all encouraged me to have a party, of course, they would all have had to get on a plane to join us in our new home. I ended up deciding to have a party the Thursday before our Saturday wedding. Asking everyone to take a couple days of vacation time still felt like asking a lot and we wanted to keep it something affordable.

My husband wasn't super interested in just going out for drinks but upon discussion we hit upon the idea of all simply meeting up in the early afternoon at our local climbing gym (which offered a group deal that ended up being \~$25/person who wasn't a member). The gym includes a cafe, courtyard, and yoga and we took advantage of all of it until dinner time. At dinner time we carpooled over to a dining hall nearby and all had dinner from the various stands. After dinner, everyone was still excited to hand out. We split up briefly so everyone could check-in at their various hotels/Airbnb's (many had come direct from the airport!) and then met up at one of the Airbnb's whose apartment complex had a pool and hot tub. We hung out there for another couple hours before getting ready to hit a fancy cocktail bar downtown. Everyone found their own preferred way to the bar and we hung out for another hour there. They purchased our drinks and a friend bought a cheap bow-tie/bridal veil for us. It ended up as an affordable night out for everyone and allowed all our friends a chance to meet and hang out to start off their weekend in SLC. I know many of them proceeded to spend the following days together exploring the city and splitting Uber costs or carpooling in the few rental cars."

"A Real-Talk Voter Guide: Santa Monica City Council Candidates, with a Deep-Dive Summary on Phil Brock and Oscar De La Torre’s Track Record",SantaMonica,1gcr6oz,2024-10-26 14:11:35,71,0.9,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaMonica/comments/1gcr6oz/a_realtalk_voter_guide_santa_monica_city_council/,SeaShoreSanta,Politics,"Hi 👋 long-time subreddit lurker, first-time poster.

Since I’m a nerd who’s quietly followed Santa Monica’s City Council the last 4 years, I thought I’d summarize a “real-talk” guide for the average voter. In particular, I want to summarize 4 years' worth of Phil and Oscar's concerning behaviors on Council, and hopefully shed some light for confused lurkers why there's such vehement discourse on them in this subreddit.

**TL;DR**: There’s a reason the Democratic party and most local organizations & community leaders are *against* Phil Brock and Oscar De La Torre. They have:

* Repeatedly aligned with conservative social views and policy
* Committed multiple questionable ethics violations
* Made policy blunders due to a lack of understanding issues
* Refused to take accountability for issues above, making excuses and pointing blame at others
* Not delivered on promises made when elected 4 years ago

***Credentials & Sources:*** *I am* *not* *affiliated with the leadership of any of the local organizations or neighborhood associations, unlike what I'm guessing might be some fellow redditors here. I just happen to be a total nerd who's been paying* ***really*** *close attention to local news, local club newsletters, and candidate interviews -- yes, I even sometimes watch City Council meetings on issues I care about. I'm hoping to summarize for the average voter what I've learned the last 4 years as an ""outsider"" observing all these issues.*

**1. THE CURRENT CITY COUNCIL**

[Santa Monica City Council](https://www.smgov.net/departments/council/content.aspx?id=13705) is a legislative body with 7 at-large members (i.e., not districted), all working on a part-time basis. All city staff report into a City Manager who reports into Council. Council decides on policy, and the City Manager and their staff bring it to life.

The Mayor is not elected by residents. They’re mostly a figurehead who runs Council meetings and cuts ribbons. The Mayor position currently rotates between Councilmembers 1x/year.

Though all 7 current members of Council are registered Democrats, voting-wise they generally split into 2 groups.

\* *indicates* *seat up for election in 2024*

**GROUP 1, The Change Slate** *(aligned with 2024 “Safer Santa Monica” slate)***:** So-named because 3 of the 4 ran as a “slate for change” together in 2020, vowing to change away from the typical liberal/progressive Democratic-party-endorsed candidates, and won after backing from the Police and Fire unions. The narrow win of the pro-safety slate was seen as a surprise upset as a response to 2020 protests (and violent looting) in Santa Monica.

* **\*Mayor Phil Brock (elected 2020):** Owns a talent agency. Former Chair of Recreation & Parks Commission and Arts Commission member.
* **\*Councilmember Oscar De La Torre (2020):** Former Executive Director of the Pico Youth & Family Center. Former longtime School Board member.
   * *Note: Oscar* [*resigned PYFC in 2013*](https://patch.com/california/santamonica/oscar-de-la-torre-resigns-from-embattled-youth-center) *amidst an investigation by the City around alleged payroll inconsistencies & potential conflicts of interests; among the reports are* [*allegations Oscar verbally insulted*](https://santamonicanext.org/2024/09/in-unearthed-2013-city-staff-report-oscar-de-la-torre-accused-of-attempting-to-instigate-racial-unrest-using-racial-and-religious-slurs/) *several PYFC board members with racial, religious, and/or ethnic slurs.*
* **\*Councilmember Christine Parra (2020):** Emergency management professional for Culver City. *Not seeking re-election.*

There’s one additional member who was not technically a Change Slate member, but often votes with them and is the “swing” vote in Council. She was appointed to a Council vacancy in 2021, but was ~~re-~~ elected *(edit)* in 2022, with backing from organizations that backed the Change Slate in 2020.

* **Vice Mayor Lana Negrete (2021):** Owns a local music store and music nonprofit supporting SM schools. Former Public Safety Reform and Oversight member.
   * *Lana filled a vacancy created by* *~~then vice-mayor~~* *~~Kristen McCowan~~* *Kevin McKeown (edit), who resigned.*

**GROUP 2, The “Establishment” slate** *(aligned with 2024 “United Democrats” slate)*: Other candidates who have typically had endorsements from the establishment groups - e.g., local Democratic party and similar organizations.

* **\*Councilmember Gleam Davis (2009):** Attorney. Has served as mayor twice. *Not seeking re-election.*
* **Councilmember Caroline Torosis (2022)**: Attorney & Senior Deputy to an LA County Supervisor. Former Rent Control Board member.
* **Councilmember Jesse Zwick (2022):** Policy Advisor to former LA City Councilmember Mike Bonan.

**3. PHIL BROCK & OSCAR DE LA TORRE’S TRACK RECORD**

**POLICIES, VOTES, & CAMPAIGN PROMISES**

**Reducing Homelessness:** In 2020, Phil and Oscar promised to reduce homelessness by 50% in their first year in office, which they did not do. Homelessness in Santa Monica has [increased](https://www.santamonica.gov/press/2023/05/04/santa-monica-releases-2023-homeless-count-results-and-previews-recommended-approach-to-homelessness#:~:text=SANTA%20MONICA%2C%20Calif.,the%20City's%202022%20Homeless%20Count) since they were elected. Now, they claim that they must be re-elected to solve the growing homelessness crisis.

**Empty Promises to Remove Needle Exchange at Reed Park:** Phil and Oscar along with Vivian and John are running on a platform to remove the needle exchange program at Reed Park. Though the program is unpopular with many residents, it’s a program run by LA County (not the city), with the Reed Park location selected by the county. Despite Phil/Oscar’s claims, City Council actually has almost no control over the program. Changes to the program would require partnership with LA County offices, whether relocation or amending administration mechanisms in a way that would feel more favorable for Santa Monica’s residents. However, Phil and Oscar have taken an antagonistic stance against working with county officials; in return, many potential local partners have expressed disdain at desires to work with the Phil/Oscar slate due to their incompetence and lack of partnership.

**Removal of Bedrolls/Sleeping Bags of Unhoused Population:** In a split 4-3 vote, City Council (led by Phil/Oscar’s slate) [voted to allow homeless individuals’ bedrolls and sleeping bags](https://smdp.com/2024/09/12/split-council-tightens-anti-camping-laws/) to be removed by city police. The minority opposing vote claimed this was inhumane treatment, forcibly making homeless individuals uncomfortable while sleeping.

**Continued Police Force Vacancies & Unused Budget:** Phil and Oscar claim that if re-elected, they will increase funding for police officers and close hiring gaps in our police department. Though there is city budget allocated for police officer positions, they remain vacant as the city continues to try and fight a police officer shortage while maintaining a high hiring bar, meaning this budget currently remains un-utilized for other city services, including funding technology that could scale police effectiveness in other ways (e.g., a real-time crime center). Despite this, Phil and Oscar’s slate have pushed for increased funding for police officer positions.

**Threatening City Services with Budget Cuts:** In 2024, Phil brought forward a proposed measure to reduce city budget across the board by 4% to further fund police officers (despite continued unfilled vacancies). This measure was proposed seemingly on a whim and surprised staff who did not have time to research it beforehand, meaning no studies were completed on the proposed budget cut’s impact to other city services: e.g., parks, libraries, fire department, sanitation and sewage, recreation and arts, etc. It’s worth noting the city continues to remain on a major budget crunch since 2020 that have continued to negatively impact city services. After urging by the Davis/Torosis/Zwick slate, the proposal was tabled for a later decision after further staff research.

**Lack of Planning Leading to Automatic Approval of Skyscraper Apartment Buildings:** Phil and Oscar claim that they are against any housing developments that would change the character of the city, including blocking any skyscraper apartment complexes. The City is able to control development decisions via zoning code, which they are able to exert as long as they maintain a compliant Housing Element, a plan produced by cities every 10 years outlining development guidelines to increase residential units to meet state-mandated minimums. If a city is non-compliant in its Housing Element, the state suspends its ability to exert zoning code and reject builders’ applications for housing developments. At the start of 2021, City Staff began presenting reports to revise the City’s Housing Element, which would go out of compliance in February 2022. Despite repeated warnings, Council (specifically Phil/Oscar’s slate) failed to pass a compliant Housing Element after failing to reach a decision. Comments made during repeated meetings over the year revealed Phil/Oscar's slates did not fully read staff’s reports preparing them for renewal. Crossing into non-compliance meant the city’s zoning privileges were revoked, [leading to automatic approval overnight of 16 high-rise apartment buildings](https://smdp.com/2022/12/06/after-housing-element-debacle-implementation-work-begins/) waiting in the pipeline. The Phil/Oscar slate expressed surprise at the overnight approvals, indicating their lack of understanding of the risks at hand; however, they deflected accountability, choosing to point blame at city staff for not preparing them adequately. The Council did not approve a compliant Housing Element until October. 

**Threatening Rent Control Protections with Ill-Researched Proposals:** Phil, Oscar and their slate claim to support renters and rent control, which is at 3% annually for rent controlled buildings. However, in 2022, a measure was brought forward by Lana and initially supported by Phil and Oscar that would have fundamentally damaged rent control protections. The proposed measure appeared to reduce caps to lower than 3%.  However, it was an ill-researched proposal - it would not comply with multiple California Supreme Court rulings requiring landlords to receive a fair return, thus enabling them to increase caps to 6% for many tenants. After warnings from the Rent Control Board and City Staff on these risks, Phil, Oscar and Lana accused them of not doing their jobs and warning them of being motivated “by political parties”. Phil and others also threw around ideas for increasing the cap to 4%, to help landlords. Ultimately, organizing at Council chambers by the Rent Control Board, Santa Monica for Renters’ Rights, and the SM Democratic Club led to the Lana and the Phil/Oscar slate backing down.

**ETHICS & CONCERNING STATEMENTS ON PERSONAL VALUES**

**Violation of State Law & Blocking Self-Incriminating Investigations:** The City Attorney has *twice* raised that there have been City council violations of the Brown Act, a state law designed to protect confidentiality of closed session items - once in 2022, and again on a separate matter in 2024.  Investigations into these violations have to be approved by City Council; however, Phil/Oscar’s slate successfully blocked the City Attorney from investigating these violations by a 4-3 vote, claiming they were ""politically motivated.""

**Refusal to Recuse Despite Conflict of Interest:** Council members typically recuse themselves on votes where there is conflict of interest. In 2016, under the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), the Pico Neighborhood Association [filed a lawsuit against the City](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/how-a-santa-monica-neighborhood-is-putting-the-california-voting-rights-act-to-work/), stating the at-large seats dilute the power of Latino voters, and that the city’s minority populations would be better served by districts (the case is currently awaiting final decision in appeals courts). The case’s main plaintiff is Maria Loya, Oscar De La Torre’s wife. During 2021 City Council votes on the CVRA case, Oscar refused to recuse himself, growing increasingly adamant there was no conflict of interest. This conflict was so concerning that his fellow councilmembers had to vote to block him from any CVRA-related decisions.

* *(EDIT: Additional Context) In response to the City Council blocking de la Torre from participating in closed session on the CVRA case, de la Torre filed a lawsuit against the City of Santa Monica seeking to overturn the vote to exclude him. Ultimately the City of Santa Monica agreed on neutral terms without liability to either party to settle this lawsuit. The City of Santa Monica paid $92,500 for de la Torre’s legal fees in June 2023. And the Councilmember can decide for himself if he has a conflict of interest; Oscar has not recused himself from votes since the settlement. (Case history* [here](https://www.santamonica.gov/conflicts-case)*; case number 21STCV08597)*

**Overspending Travel Budget & Wrongfully Blaming City Staff:** In 2023, After Phil and Oscar overspent their travel policy allocations for attending conferences, they brought forward a motion to reallocate budget from other councilmembers to cover up their own overspending. Phil put blame towards City staff for not notifying him of his overspending, claiming it was not his fault and the whole exercise was absurd. However, email records later revealed this was a lie, as Phil had acknowledged warnings from staff in writing.

**Antisemitic Comments:** In 2019, while on the School Board, [Oscar stated](https://smdp.com/2024/10/11/a-damning-statement/) *“The biggest problem with the school board is that* ***it’s run by the Jews***\*.”\*  Oscar has [vehemently denied this](https://smdp.com/2024/10/12/accusations-are-politics-and-lies/); however, [others have since corroborated](https://smdp.com/2024/10/16/a-corroborating-account/) the original author's claims. This came to a head in City Council chambers this week, when [members of the community](https://smdp.com/2024/10/24/oscar-de-la-torre-faced-multiple-accusations-of-racism-in-tuesdays-council-meeting/) called out Oscar for his concerning comments; Oscar continued to vehemently deny the accusations as mud-slinging. 

**Anti-Trans Dog-whistling Comments on Gender Neutral Bathroom:** After City Staff spent 2 years researching and preparing a recommended ordinance to require gender-neutral public restrooms in new buildings, [Phil and Oscar raised concerns](https://www.surfsantamonica.com/ssm_site/the_lookout/news/News-2023/April-2023/04_21_2023_Councilmembers_Concerned_About_Gender_Neutral_Public_Restrooms.html) about crime and safety for women and kids – i.e., the same dog-whistling comments commonly used in anti-trans rhetoric. After organizing by residents and the SM Democratic Club wherein  City Council was overwhelmed with public comment supporting the measure, the ordinance passed unanimously.

**Voting against joining Pro-Gender Affirming Healthcare Amicus Brief:** In closed session, Council voted against joining an amicus brief on federal suit against State of Tennessee for banning gender-affirming health care for transgender health care, which several other cities with like minded values to Santa Monica had joined.

**Pulling Support for anti-Hate Speech Statement:** In a 2022 vote on a new City Statement condemning hate speech (language [here](https://www.santamonica.gov/press/2022/07/28/santa-monica-city-council-statement-against-hate)), following discussion of anti-homophobic and transphobic language in the statement, Oscar De la Torre decided to [abstain](https://santamonicacityca.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=15&ID=1347&Inline=True) rather than support the measure. Though Phil supported the measure, during discussion he expressed surprise and incredulity that LGBTQ staff face discrimination.

**Disparagement of City Staff & Leadership Turnover:** City Staff have faced increasing strain in their positions since Covid budget cuts led to mass layoffs; these strains have been exacerbated by disparaging comments made by the Phil/Oscar slate against city staff, often in cases where they are finger-pointing blame for their own mistakes. Since they’ve come to office, Santa Monica has seen turnover in its City Manager (e.g., “City CEO” reporting to City Council), Fire Chief, Library Director, Chief Information Officer, Finance Director, City Attorney, City Clerk, Recreation and Arts Director, Housing and Human Services Director, Department of Transportation Director, and Housing Director. It's worth noting this turnover is likely due to a multitude of reasons and can’t all be directly tied back to Council’s comments; however, continued disparaging comments will impact the City’s ability to attract and retain new talent for filling vacancies.

**“Citizen’s Arrest” of a Homeless Man on Fox News:** Phil Brock was filmed by local Fox News as he was “attacked” by an unhoused individual on Fox News. Phil turned the opportunity into a photo op and went on to do [talking head segments on Fox](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6331786933112). Phil’s comments on the “danger” of the Promenade in other channels have been noted as having a potential negative impact on visitors’ and tourists’ views of Santa Monica, who the city relies on for much of its tax revenue.

**Trip to El Salvador, and Comments Praising its Dictator:** ~~Phil,~~ *(edit)* Oscar, Christine and Lana took a trip to El Salvador at invitation from its government officials, and came back praising the country and its leadership for “bringing freedom back to the country” in a prepared statement (2023). El Salvador is currently run by a dictator and has a history of human rights violations.

–

There's *way* more that could be said in addition to the above: how the Phil/Oscar slate have tried introducing measures late at night (post-midnight) long after most the public is paying attention, how they've tried to silence public comment in council chambers, how they've replaced numerous competent and long-standing members of city boards and commissions with personal connections (seemingly motivated by personal political vendettas), how many other accusations have arisen over other violations of the Brown Act over the couple noted above, etc. It all paints a picture of two individuals who are very concerned with their popularity among the NIMBYs they're affiliated with, who don't understand the basic fundamentals of the job, and who care more about hearing themselves talk than caring about democratic process or the basic ethical guardrails surrounding them.

I fully expect some *very* angry responses from the pro-Phil/Oscar redditors on here. But from my observations the last 4 years, though, I’m incredibly frustrated with the lack of competence and character exhibited by Phil and Oscar. Their rhetoric claiming ***only*** ***they*** have the answers to our city’s housing, homelessness, and safety issues when their behavior suggests they lack basic accountability and fundamental understanding of the issues at hand is ***incredibly*** infuriating.

Please, do **NOT** vote for the incumbents just because it says “mayor” or “councilmember” under their name on the ballot. It's easy to be lazy and just vote for incumbents down-ballot, but some (like Oscar and Phil) have *very* concerning track records if you really dig in.

Do your own research, and please, **VOTE.**

**Chapter 301: A Familiar Tale**

I peeked over a boulder.

A resting butterfly fluttered its wings at me, before dancing away in search of the promised land which was my orchard. 

I wished it well. And also that it’d take me along with it.

The bad news was that it must have failed to hear my plea.

The good news was that I could soon make my way back to enjoy the splendour of my blushing apple trees myself.

Here at the base of a mountain enshrouded by mist, there was more than the colourless crags and uneven slopes. 

Not a lot more, yes … but enough to host a gathering of malcontents so suspicious that a smile from my etiquette tutor was benign in comparison.

A hive of activity greeted my eyes.

Figures garbed in scarlet robes went to and fro before a large iron door slotted into the mountainside. Braziers burned against the fading dusk, lighting up the sweat upon their faces as they lifted away sacks like hurried dockworkers before the last light. 

Yet for all the telltale monotony of their robes, it was the myriad of cudgels at their hips which gave them away. Crass weapons held by those who’d never wielded an armament before. 

These were not soldiers or mercenaries. 

No … they were far more dangerous.

*Dragon Cultists*.

I nodded as they worked away, their backs audibly echoing amidst the tall crags.

And then–I smiled.

“Ohohoho … behold, Coppelia!”

“I’m beholding\~”

“See where my unparalleled intuition for the abodes of our foes takes us! No matter where they seek to hide from my righteous gaze, not even a mountain enveloped in mist can cloud my perception!”

“Eh? But didn’t we just follow the road? Look, you can see the festival from here\~”

Coppelia pointed at the ribbons and flags in the distance. I lowered her hand.

“T-That’s besides the point … rather, it’s precisely because the two locations are so close that this is a noteworthy achievement! To place one’s secret lair in so easily seen a location is a level of deception which would have lesser princesses lost and waiting for a dozen knights to break their ankles trying to rescue them!”

“But there’s a sign saying ‘The Bewitching Oracle’s Home.”

“Another level of subterfuge. To claim a mountain hovel as a home would see even the worst of drunken misfits hurrying away in embarrassment.”

Indeed, hoodlums may be blind to their odour, but not to their squalor.

A problem, then.

It was clear these were not ordinary ruffians who’d stolen away Coppelia’s dragon. 

These were the fantasist variety, drunk on the wine of some ploy so far above them not even I could see it. Especially as I made no effort to.

My eyes were drawn to one thing only. And that was the fair fields of my kingdom.  

… Right! It was time to save a dragon!

“Some foul deed is at work,” I said as I already began brushing my hands of Ouzelia. “It’s one thing to abduct a dragon, but to also have so many followers prepared means that whatever ambitions are at play, it’s more than inappropriate curiosity which compels it. I shall raise my princess premium accordingly.”

Coppelia giggled. As was appropriate. Since a kidnapped dragon was clearly unsuitable as an employer, then he may as well be a jester instead.

“I didn’t know the princess premium was negotiable.”

“Ohohoho … of course it is. I’m highly flexible regarding my dragon rescue rates. I offer 14 different levels of bankruptcy.” 

“Really? What’s the difference between them?”

“There isn’t any. I sit and hum while insinuating there are 13 worse options.”

“Ooh\~ the illusion of choice. I like that!”

“It isn’t an illusion. He’s free to pick any of the identically different compensation packages I’ll be tabling while also tapping away at his shackles with ever decreasing speed.”

I craned my neck as I looked up.

The mountain rose so high that only my magnanimity loomed taller. Coppelia joined me, hand to her brows as she squinted at the faraway peak.

“I think I see a hidden path,” she said, rising to her tip-toes. “There’s a narrow and uneven ledge which looks worn from all the people who have slipped and fallen off to their doom. We should be able to hop our way across. What do you think?”

“I think I’m a princess, not a gazelle.”

“Ahaha\~ it’s not that bad. As long as you’re not permanently drunk like most humans are while trying to relieve their tiny, insignificant existences, you can do it!”

“I’ve no doubt I can. Even so, I hardly see why we should hop into the waiting maze that a mountain lair shorn of inspiration will boast. There’s a perfectly serviceable entrance right before us.”

I pointed at the door slotted into the mountain just beneath us. 

Coppelia reached her fist high into the sky.

“Yay! We’re gonna \[Ball Of Doom\] through the front door!”

“We are most certainly *not* doing any such thing. For one thing, I do not acknowledge what a \[Ball Of Doom\] is. For another, I am a guest. And this means I would never cause a scene unless someone breathed in my direction first. Until that faux pas, I intend for us to be politely chaperoned towards your missing dragon.”

A hum of puzzlement met my diligence to propriety.

“Eh? But isn’t that for whoever has the grand ticket prize? The one you ignored so you can shamefully hide a scandalous bestseller behind all the history books?”

My mouth widened with indignation.

And then I said nothing … for a moment, at least.

“E-Excuse me! I do not hide my study material out of shame! I do so because they are so unworthy of time that I would not have the maids dusting them unnecessarily.”

I gave a cough, subtly diverting attention while drowning out the ensuing giggle.  

“Furthermore, if I don’t require a ticket to wander the backstage of the Royal Arc Theatre while providing helpful last minute advice to change the entire script, I certainly don’t need one to see a dragon.”

Coppelia tilted her head slightly, finger to her cheek in thought.

“Hmmmmm … but these aren’t normal goons blocking our way. You might not know this, but dragon cultists take themselves super seriously. Look, they’ve even got matching sandals.”

“Yes, to unite in their distaste for fashion is a clear sign of their fervour. But that isn’t a problem. It’s a solution.”

“Got it!\~ And what’s that?”

I placed my hand upon my chest and smiled.

“The most effective one there is. To reach their hearts in such a manner that I lift the spell of bewitchment cast upon them.” 

Indeed!

It was time to show my loyal handmaiden the truest side to me!

A princess whose words could move even the most enthralled of minds! 

True, dragon cultists were a different brand of hoodlum. If they were so uncouth in their zealotry that a simple request for them to do everything I wished without question would go unanswered, then many a lesser princess would resort to tears instead. 

A powerful weapon. But one I would not use to gain anything less than a unicorn.

Thus, I brushed down the dust that wasn’t on me and skipped past the boulder.

Exuding a princess’s regal aura, I disregarded both the plethora of wooden signs and the blinks as I proceeded to stroll through the gathering. 

The cultists stopped where they worked, the confusion clear on their faces as they realised that colours other than a single shade of spilled wine existed to be worn. And possibly because Coppelia was waving as though from a carriage window.

Soon, a sizable group before the door were torn from their chatter.

High enough ranked to loiter, but not enough to be excused from wearing the same robes. Each offered a different shade of bewilderment as we approached, before the most senior of the doorstops was forced to display his badge of authority.

A frown.

“Stop.” He held up his palm, then gestured behind me. “Did you read the signs?”

I waited for Coppelia to look behind on my behalf.

“No. Why? Were they important?”

“Very. They say no visitors, customers or festivalgoers. If you want the Bewitching Oracle, she’s closed her reservations list. If you want the fireworks display, you need to go back the way you came. This area is staff only.”

I clapped my hands in delight.

“Excellent. I was just looking for staff. My congratulations. I happen to be hiring for Ouzelia’s newest and most prestigious cult.”

Blank stares met my words.

I smiled.

“… *Me*.”

Ohohohohohohohohoho!

Once again, my genius soared so high that not even a dragon could reach it!

Indeed, I may not know the way of this land … but I knew the way of hearts!

Here were fools already proven to be susceptible to whatever sweet promises were whispered to them! And who could offer more than a beautiful maiden whose very smile paralyses mermaids with joy and whose touch unparalyses them once the drooling becomes too severe?

Why, I had no need to waste my scowl! 

Against those already bribed with nothing more than a charlatan’s words, all I needed to earn their submission was to dangle something even finer! 

Thus … a rare and limited opportunity to join an organisation both exclusive to Ouzelia and respectful of local customs!

The *Cult Of Juliette*!

A dignified group neither associated with the *Juliette Fixes Everything Foundation*, or in case anyone from my kingdom ever asked, myself in any way!

For a moment, the hoodlums stared wordlessly at me. 

Understandable. I was clearly a stranger in a strange land. But while my disapproval of falling pianos was indecipherable to them, the warmth of my smile was not.

A moment later–

I heard a chorus of groans.

“Look here, ma’am,” said the chief doorstop, his hand flinging to the air. “I have *told* you people already. We have a cult. We don’t need another.”

“Wha–”

My mouth widened in shock.

This … This was not the response I was expecting!

“We are the most devout followers of the Bewitching Oracle. And if you’d read any of the signs, you’d also know that no advertising and *no* poaching is allowed.”

I was speechless.

Why … for news of the establishment of Ouzelia’s most esteemed cult to be met with such disregard was beyond all notions of belief! 

This was a historic opportunity! I was certainly never coming here again–this meant any followers I hired now would proudly and automatically become the chosen few!

“E-Excuse me! I am no poacher! I am a bringer of joy!” 

Behind the doorstop, his colleagues were rolling their eyes. 

I almost fainted on the spot.

“Every poacher is a bringer of joy. It’s all words, no tangible benefits.”

“No … No tangible benefits?” My hand went to my mouth. It was likely to permanently stay there, such was my horror. “... I have never been so insulted!”

The chief doorstop gave a tired sigh.

“Is that right? Well, I’m sorry, ma’am. But that’s the way of it. Do you have any idea how competitive the market is? It’s been oversaturated for years. You can’t just expect to declare a new cult and immediately start headhunting from other groups.”

“I most certainly can! And if you knew what benefits I provided, you would leap from the ship you’re on well before the need to do it when it shortly capsizes!”

Indignant faces met my statement. They should be wreathed with joy instead.

“Do your benefits include health checks?”

“Excuse me? What do you mean by health checks?”

“Biannual health checks with a certified healer.” The chief doorstop frowned. “What about a regular non-rota schedule? Consecutive and uninterrupted rest days? Bonuses in addition to and not in place of a competitive salary?”

My mouth further widened behind my hand. Soon I’d need both of them.

“A *salary*?! Which cult gives a salary?!”

“Ours. The Cult of the Bewitching Oracle.”

“That is outrageous! Any cult leader giving more than threats of violence for not doing their bidding is against all norms! Something is clearly suspect!”

“If it is, I’ve yet to notice. But since the Bewitching Oracle gives two free advice sessions a year as well, I’m sure she’d tell me if something was wrong.”

Hearty murmurs filled the air as all the doorstops nodded in shared joy.

Hoodlums. *Happy*.

I took a step back, horrified beyond measure.

This … This was no ordinary fortune teller! 

To offer so much to nameless goons fated to be discarded once this dragon scheme came to fruition spoke of a willingness to sacrifice more than crowns, but time.

To think I’d underestimated the lengths those in Ouzelia were willing to go to. 

Compared to abducting a dragon, organising working benefits for disposable followers spoke of a patience which none of my nobility were willing to display.

A dangerous adversary.

But one I would not allow to overshadow me in the art of persuasion. Particularly as I was being judged by so many–myself included.

“I see.” I gave a nod of acknowledgement. “Then it seems I need to offer something better.”

The miscreants before me shuffled with poorly veiled interest. No matter what they said, those who coveted once would covet again.

“We are devout followers of the Bewitching Oracle,” repeated the chief doorstop, without explicitly telling me to leave. “You’ve nothing to offer which could draw us from the path we’ve been set upon.”

“Oh? Yet I’ve something which few deserve and all desperately need. And I’m willing to offer it as a joining bonus.”

Then, I raised out my arms, assuming my natural pose as a grounded angel.

“... My wisdom.”

Silence.

Gone were the looks of clear expectation. Disbelief replaced it instead. I nodded. A far more appropriate response.

And then–

“Bwahahahhaaha!!”

“Ahaha … oho … that’s a good one!”

“Ho, I almost feel like joining if that’s the jokes you’ve got! That’s good, really helps clearing my head!”

“Ahahahaha\~”

“C-Coppelia?! Why are you laughing as well?!”

I waited as the chorus of laughter slowly died, joined unhelpfully by a handmaiden whose enthusiasm clearly needed tempering with a better sense of timing.

“This is no laughing matter,” I said with a frown. “It is a serious proposition.” 

“Ma’am, please.” The doorstop chuckled, his mood much improved. “The Bewitching Oracle is a certified sage. Her job is to give wisdom. Great wisdom, too. Twice a year to each of us as standard. Why should we listen to yours?”

I offered a smile in response.

The laughter ceased at once. After all, mine was more bewitching than anyone who hoped to steal the word for themselves.

“It sounds like you wish for a trial period.” I gave a hum of consideration. “Very well, then. Never let it be said that I wasn’t generous. My wisdom is this. *You do not want to stand in front of that door*.”

Glances went to the entrance behind them. Looks of doubt returned towards me.

“Why’s that, then?”

“I have come to rescue the dragon.”

Whatever trails of laughter threatened to return finally died. The doubt turned to expressions of incredulity.

“... Say that again?”

“I’m aware you have a dragon captive against his will. And while I’ve little knowledge regarding what tragic ploy this ridiculous festival entails, know that any scheme at play is irrelevant. I have come to rescue the dragon.” 

The assembled hoodlums looked around. Some towards each other. Some towards those working around them. Some towards the door they were guarding.

All wore the same disbelief.

Eventually, the chief doorstop furrowed his brows, his hand clenched around his cudgel.

“Ma’am, what you just said is the opposite of wisdom.”

“Is it now?”

“What?”

I clasped both hands against my chest and smiled.

“Here I am, a beautiful maiden with only my loyal handmaiden by my side, at the gate of a mountain lair filled with foes, mystery and hardship still waiting to be sprung. And here you are. The very first rung on the ladder. The first fish bone in a sole au beurre persillé à l'ail. The first doorstop only trusted to wield clubs more likely to strike your own heads than your foes. When the first alarm rings, it is your cry destined to sound it. You have overwhelming numbers, yet utterly no knowledge of who I am. Are you *absolutely* certain you wish to block my way?”

All at once, the faces paled around me.

Realisation came sharper than any blade they might have wielded as they counted the odds entirely weighted in their favour, against a backdrop still yet to be explored.

And then–

“Oh man. I got something in my eye. I’m squinting so hard. I can’t see a thing.”

“I’m just gonna lean down and tie the laces on my … on my sandals.”

“What’s this weird blot on my robes? Ugh, it’s gonna take ages cleaning this.”

“The sky looks so pretty. Wow. So blue.”

Immediately, a wall of backs turned to me as eyes stared at the ground, at the sky and themselves, all the while a clear gap was left towards the open entrance.

Ohohohohoho!

And how right they were to! 

I was no heroine, but how did they know otherwise? How utterly joyful it was to use Ouzelia’s own unreasonableness against them!

Thus, I accepted the generosity.

“Wait.”

All the way until a lone doorstop failed to understand the nature of this moment. 

I was aggrieved. As were all those around him. An elbow was thrust into his waist by a desperate colleague. Still, he persisted, his gaze squarely upon me.

“You cannot be serious,” I bemoaned. “Surely, you don’t intend to stop me?”

“Uh, no, I don’t.”

“No? Then what is it?”

“Well, I was just hoping you could tell me more about this cult of yours.”

A moment of silence passed.

And then–I clapped my hands in joy.

Looking for advice on Navy Intel Officer program,newtothenavy,1g36vlv,2024-10-13 23:14:27,0,0.44,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/1g36vlv/looking_for_advice_on_navy_intel_officer_program/,throwaw_ay4advice,,"I am 23 and currently have been working a corporate job that I do not care for. I've done some research on intel officers and was seeking more direct advice.

A few things:

I have spoken with an officer recruiter and am in the process of scheduling my OAR. The recruiter did not know much about intel and was unable to give me any intel connections in the Navy to speak with.

I am not worried about not being selected, majored in math, had a near 4.0 GPA and have some leadership experience.

I do have interest in the military, almost joined the marines out of college but was not excited about not being able to pick my career path (would not have been happy being like a finance officer or something).

-I want to get out after 4 years and use the GI Bill on Law School via Yellow Ribbon programs.

What I am asking about is a few different things:

-Does anyone on here have experience as a Navy intel officer? I'd love to chat via comments or DM to gain more insight on the day to day and what you worked on. From my understanding and previous reddit threads, you are in charge of intel roles, give briefings based on the data analysis, and write reports.

-How often did you go to sea? I am drawn to the idea of going out to sea and traveling a bit. If I'd go on a sea tour or two most likely during the 4 years, that would be ideal, staying on a Navy US base for four years is less attractive.

-Any roles I should also consider? I want to do something specific to the military for the experience and my personal interest rather than something that could be completely replicated by a corporate job."

This was just a couple minutes ago, I've (19 MTF) been housebound with major depression for about 6 months, my mom asked me how I was feeling and I was blunt, I'm getting worse and on top of that, I don't feel safe or comfortable around you, ever. I asked her why she used to hit me and she blew up; came over to me, forcibly hugged me said I was scaring her, asked where I had picked this up, asked me to give an example of when she hit me etc. She stormed off then obviously told my dad cause he comes lumbering down and gives me the same speech about how he loves us and he'd never hit either of us even though I KNOW he's hit my brother before and I always worried he'd do it to me, maybe he even did idfk.

Thing is, I KNOW she and dad hit me, it's not a daily or even weekly occurrence and I'm grateful for that, but they have and because they have I've never been comfortable around them, I flinch super easily, whenever they get near me I worry they're going to punch my shoulder or slap me.

I hate living in this house, my mother is perfectly happy to get me another lukewarm therapist who doesn't pry too deep but when it comes to getting me hrt, something that would actually massively help my mental health it's all ""oh but you'll just gain weight and be even moodier, have you seen all the side-effects, have you planned for everything?"" She's perfectly happy to stop all her support when it comes to that.

And I do need the support, I'm a 19 year old autistic woman whose had depression and anxiety basically my entire life, I can't cook, don't have access to my finances (barely understand finances for that matter), they have my computer which is my only window into the outside world right now. I'm terrified that if I act out or push back this house will turn into a jail cell. I'm really scared what they're going to do now."

I tried to run. I know. Bad idea. But most of you haven’t felt what I felt that night. At least, I hope you haven’t. For your own sake.

There is little in the world that is more terrifying than your heart wrenching with fear as you lie in bed, drenched in your own sweat, eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling. Keenly aware of your own mortality. Any man, anyone, any living thing, would want to get away from anything that makes them feel that way. So, I ran.

By the way, I thought I should provide you guys with an easy way to keep track of these experiences, if only to have a neat log of my death throes for posterity's sake. So, I made an index. After all, this is looking to be getting a little voluminous. I’ll keep updating it as and when I post, provided I’m not actively in the jaws of some monstrosity at that point. Check at the end of this for the link.

Anyway, after a refreshing afternoon siesta, it was time to meet my lawyer. I put on one of the clean white tunics the servants had left out while I was sleeping. As the evening fell, the air was growing chilly, and the wind was picking up across the open fields outside, so I had Bhanu bring me a shawl. Not carrying a good jacket or sweater had been an oversight. I had completely forgotten how cold it could get in these remote places at night, even outside of winter.

What I did not forget was to swipe Ramu’s knife off the table and stick it in one of my pockets. I was not making the mistake of being unarmed, even inside the house.

My uncle was waiting for me as I threw the shawl around my shoulders and descended the stairs. He was similarly dressed in a woollen shawl and a tunic, his smile in its usual place.

“Now you look the part, kid. All that shirt and jeans bullshit won’t fly in this house.”

I chuckled, picking at the edges of the shawl. “I almost feel like I belong here. Part of the scenery, you know? Almost.”

“Hey. This is your home.” He walked up and grabbed my shoulder. “That remains true, no matter how many years you spend away from it. Your father did what he thought was best when he left. I don’t blame him. But even he always felt its pull. Whenever something went wrong, he would be on his way here the next day. We never even needed to call. He just felt it, and he came back.”

“He came back. And he died.”

He nodded. “And he died.”

“What happened that night, *kaku*? I deserve to know.”

“You do.” He sighed and took his hand off my shoulder, turning his back to me. “But I cannot tell you. He never discussed it with me, though I asked. Not with any of us. Only your grandfather knows what truly happened. At least, he knew.”

“I see.”

“I’m sorry.” He looked back at me. “This place has painful connotations for you, as it has for all of us. You did not want to come back, and I can understand why. But you’re here now. And you’re family. Our family. All of us are with you. Whatever this is… we can handle it. We always have.”

I stepped closer to him. “Grandfather could not do it, and he knew this land from birth.”

“And through him, and us, so will you.” He faced me again. “On that note, we must speak soon. About the situation here. You’ve had enough excitement for one day, but tomorrow, come find me. There is information to cover. There are rituals to be performed. The coming of a new *Thakur* is a crucial time. Nothing can go wrong.”

“I don’t understand.”

“It’ll all make sense eventually. Trust me, kid.” He gestured at the hallway. “The lawyer’s in the study. You should go see him now. He’ll explain the mundane side of things to you. Property, finances. You know it better than me.”

“That makes one thing.” I sighed. “Thanks, uncle. By the way, where are the others?”

“My brothers? They’re out for tonight. Working. You’ll see them in the morning.” He gave me a small wave, nodding towards the study. “Go. Don’t want him to get mad.”

The study was exactly as I had left it in the vision. The only difference was the dust that hung like a thick pall over the room. Evidently, it had not been aired out or cleaned since the disappearance of its last owner. Mercifully, the power was on this time, so the chandelier-like light overhead was working, illuminating the room with a diffuse yellow glow.

A portly, balding man in a suit struggled out of one of the chairs when he saw me enter, extending a hand.

“Mr. Sen, so nice to finally meet you. My sincerest condolences about your grandfather.”

“Thank you.” I gestured at him to take his seat and took one of my own.

We faced each other across a small table.

“Mr. Sen, my name is Jacob Durham, of Durham and Co. Solicitors in Kolkata. I have worked closely with your grandfather for a long time. I was shocked to learn of his untimely demise. And in such a tragic manner too.”

I nodded. “It came as a shock to us all. Life has been a whirlwind ever since.”

“I imagine so.” He produced a briefcase from behind his chair and set it on the table. “Of course, the association between our firm and your family goes back much farther. We have worked with your estate for almost two centuries now, ever since 1825. My father, his father, and his father before him have all served your family. And now, I get to continue the line with you.”

“I understand you’re here with details about the inheritance.” I saw right through his attempts to create a sense of familiarity. It was a common trick of the trade. But with me, that relationship would have to be earned through competence.

“Indeed.” He sharply opened the briefcase and produced a few stacks of documents, lists, and diagrams. “I understand you are in our noble profession yourself. Good. Then this should not take as long as I feared.”

It still took several hours. I won’t bore you with the details, but it suffices to say that the implications are staggering. The manor and the surrounding lands were directly the personal possessions of the family, with some of it beyond the current boundaries leased out on long-term covenants to farmers. Beyond that, we held revenue rights and limited administrative rights over the entirety of the village land, as set out in the survey records he showed me. We also owned the forest behind the estate, as well as the mountain beyond it that served as the natural landmark before which Chhayagarh was built.

Okay, I should probably explain the forest. I told you the land was dry and hard, and that’s still true. But somehow, right at the base of the mountain, the place has managed to grow a lush, dense forest. Such vegetation density is not present anywhere else in the region. A part of the forest falls within our estate walls and contains the family grove, but most of it is outside, with only a narrow path winding through it to reach the steps that lead up the mountain. I theorize that the mountain caught what little rain the place gets and concentrated it there to allow the forest to grow, but knowing what I know now, there could have been some occult shit involved.

In any case, I found out that there were even more remote assets: townhouses in Kolkata and some other cities, satellite estates in the countryside, temple and shrine revenue, old hunting and lumber forests, business ventures, and even investment portfolios and commercial real estate. Even accounting for the maintenance and labour costs to keep everything functional, the property was raking in an absurd amount of money.

“Someone has been putting in the work to grow the pie,” I muttered, rifling through some deeds that described stakes in offshore oil blocks in the Americas.

“The family has been accumulating its assets for centuries, Mr. Sen. Usually, such estates lose a lot to mismanagement over the years, but I’m happy to report that such is not the case with yours.”

“A lot to keep track of.”

“I wouldn’t worry about it. Most of these assets are handled by a network of trusts and corporations with experienced administrators. Trustworthy ones. We have spent a lot of time perfecting the governance structure. I will send the documents over if you like, but the gist is that we can take care of maintaining and growing the estate. You need only decide how to best spend the windfall. Your family has always invested heavily in the village, both for welfare and other, more esoteric purposes. Those ones, I never fully understood.”

“You and me both, Mr. Durham. You and me both.”

He shrugged lightly. “I’m not paid to ask questions. In any case, if you ever need anything from the estate, let me know. We’ll make it happen.”

One of you had prompted me to think about the legal status of our *zamindari* all the way back in my first post, so I took the opportunity to pop the question.

“Ah.” Durham scratched his chin, smiling. “That’s a good question, Mr. Sen. Actually, there are laws on the books specifically about Chhayagarh, ever since the British administration. But we think these laws are based on even older laws. We have found *firmans* from the Sultans and the Mughals specifically protecting your family’s rights over this village, and decrees from the Hindu and Buddhist kings before them. They’re really obscure and difficult to retrieve. Almost redacted. But these laws all exempt this village from any land redistribution laws or other such measures. We keep checking periodically to see if all is in order, but in short, your family’s right over this inheritance is specifically and particularly protected by legislation. It has been so for as long as we have records.”

“Why were these laws passed?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“We are not aware. Maybe your family lobbied for them. Maybe the government had reasons of its own. Either way, the better for you and the worse for them.” He replaced the papers in his suitcase, leaving only a few out for me to sign. “Feel free to go through these. They will confirm the estate handover, the continuance of the governance structure, and other procedural things. All routine.”

It took about half an hour more until I was done reading and signing. Then Durham took the papers and replaced them in his case. Despite the name, he looked as native as I did, so I guessed he must have had some English blood somewhere up the tree.

“Now, as for the personal possessions your grandfather left you…” He rose to his feet and crossed over to a corner behind me. “Excuse me.”

When he returned, he held three parcels of varying sizes, as well as a sturdy wooden walking stick. “I had sealed these for safekeeping in my custody when I was instructed to, in accordance with your grandfather’s instructions. I warrant that no one has tampered with them since I retrieved them, though I cannot know what happened prior to my arrival.”

I nodded. He was a little too formal with me, given his advanced age. “So, these are the articles he left me?”

“Indeed. Firstly…” He handed me the stick. “Your grandfather’s walking stick. It has apparently been a long-time family heirloom, used by eight *Thakurs* before you. He wanted you to have it. Use it if you wish.”

I raised it to the light, studying it. I recognized the gnarly top, the darkish wood, and the simple metal tip at the bottom. Not just because I had seen it in that fateful vision. I remembered it well from my childhood: the telltale, comforting clacks echoing through the halls, indicating my grandfather on his regular rounds through the house.

“Then, we have this.” He opened one of the packages and handed me a gold-and-black ring, decorated with heraldry: a circular shield with a ribbon framing it, crossed over by a sword and a torch. Two lions held it up on either side. There was no motto.

“That is your family crest. This ring has been used as a symbol of office by the head of your family since time immemorial. I recommend you keep it and wear it all the time. It is both priceless and timeless.”

I slipped it onto my left index finger. It fit snugly; in fact, it may have been the light playing tricks on me, but I could have sworn I saw it shift and change size, adapting to my measurements.

“A natural fit. Truly, you boys are born into this role.” Durham gave me a polite smile, before moving on to the next package. “You own all the books in the family libraries and archives anyway, but your grandfather specifically insisted I hand this one over to your hands only. It took a while to track down. He had it in a bank locker all the way out in Singapore.”

He handed me a worn book. There was no title or name on the cover, but from looks alone, that was not surprising. It wasn’t a novel. It was a journal.

“This book was not listed in the preservation records of the family chronicles. I had no idea it even existed a few weeks ago, except that I perhaps saw your grandfather writing in it once. But that was many years ago.”

“What does it say?” I turned it around in my hands, hoping some clue would appear to explain it all. Unfortunately, there was nothing.

Durham gave me a crisp and incredulous laugh. “Mr. Sen, you must think me an amateur if you are implying that I would rifle through my client’s possessions. Please, find out at your own leisure. In any case…” He unwrapped the last package.

It revealed a simple golden necklace, completely unadorned. The pendant held nothing except one large, whitish stone. It was almost like a pearl, but the texture was off.

“What is that?” I raised an eyebrow.

“I have no idea. I only found out about it when your grandfather told me to secure it in his study after he was gone. He was extremely insistent that you wear it at all times.”

“This thing?” It did not go with my fashion at all, to be honest.

He shrugged again. “It’s yours now, Mr. Sen. Wear it. Kick it. Burn it. Your call. But he really was very insistent when he called me up about it, the night he disappeared.”

I perked up at that. “He called you that night?”

“Yes, shortly before he set out, from what I heard. That’s when he told me to facilitate the transfer of the estate to you and hold onto these articles. For if… when something happened.”

“He knew? That he was going to…”

“He said it was a possibility.” Durham sighed. “Your grandfather did this often, you know. Planning for his own death. It wasn’t even the first time this year that I had received such a call. I know he did something dangerous. Something to do with this place. But he never let me in on the details. I never thought… I never thought it would be real this time.” He sighed again, pressing his fingers to his temples.

“Sounds like you were really close.” More to placate him than anything else, I slipped on the necklace right then and there. “I’m sorry.”

“Family is family, Mr. Sen. Your loss far outstrips mine.” He got to his feet, slowly buttoning his coat. “Now, it is getting rather late. That more or less concludes our business. If you have any more questions, I am here till tomorrow afternoon. If there’s something after that, well… I’m always just a phone call away. Though your grandfather preferred his letters. Either works for me.”

I got to my feet as well, and we shook hands. “Good night, Mr. Durham, and thank you. For everything.”

After this, dinner was another blur. Durham took his food in his room, I was told. I talked with my grandmother and uncle. Just polite chitchat, nothing important. I think paying some compensation to Ramu’s father was discussed. My uncle said he would take care of it. Servants were whirling in and out, replacing dishes and utensils. But my mind was elsewhere. On the ring, on the book, on the necklace. On the walking stick, of all things.

Why did my grandfather think I needed to have these things? And these things in particular?

Despite my curiosity, I found quickly that I was in no condition to burn the midnight oil. My eyes began drooping almost as soon as I entered the bedroom. The day had taken its toll. The journal would have to wait for tomorrow, I told myself. I took the ring off and placed it on the nightstand, alongside the knife. I was about to do the same with the necklace, but as soon as I touched the clasp, my fingers tingled. A sense of impending danger stabbed into my skull like a knife. I decided to leave it where it was.

Thank the gods for that.

It was late when I snapped awake.  The power had gone out again, but the room was still cool. The nights could get downright chilly here. That was not something to be concerned about.

What was concerning was that it was getting colder, and fast. My breath was beginning to mist, and the metal bedframe was icy to the touch. The cold was almost alive, malicious even, as it wormed its way deep into my body. I had never experienced it myself, but I imagined this is what people who fell into frozen lakes felt. Cold, deeper and stronger than anything they had ever felt before.

My joints barely moved, as if stuck in jelly. Soon, frost began to form on the ceiling, slowly inching its way outwards and down the walls.

The only warm thing in the room was the necklace. Hell, it was scorching, like an open flame against my collarbone. At that moment, I was almost afraid I would soon start smelling burning flesh. Heat and cold. What a way to die.

The same overwhelming sense of danger stabbed over and over into my brain, seeming to point towards the only window in the room. It was on the far wall from the door, behind and to the side of the bed. Slowly, forcing my neck to work through the chill, I turned my head to look at it.

The room I had been furnished with had no balcony of its own. The only thing outside that window was a thin ledge, mostly decorative, though workers could attach scaffolding to it if they needed to do repairs. At the moment, no repairs are required.

But all the same, there was a face pressed against the window. A pale woman with long dark hair cascading past her shoulders. She had a small smirk on her face, staring right at me through the glass. The stabbing pain in my head reached a new fever pitch. The necklace positively throbbed with heat, in tune with my quickening heartbeat.

The window was locked, held in place by two heavy deadbolts. For now, those seemed to be in place. The woman had noticed my gaze upon her. Her smirk split into a full-on smile and she leaned closer and planted a small kiss on the glass. Frost radiated outwards from her lips, crackling as it spread.

I could feel my pupils dilate in panic. The cold was reaching an intolerable level now, deadening every inch of skin. I tried to sit up, but my muscles were spasming, working slowly and hesitantly. Or not at all.

The window was completely frosted now, with only a translucent outline of the woman outside visible. I saw her raise her hand and touch it.

Then, the thick glass exploded inwards, scattering shards all over the floor. The cool night air blew in, chilling the air even more. Along with it came thick, billowing mist, covering the floor and furniture until it looked more like a swamp than a room.

A bare, slender leg extended through the ragged hole in the window, almost gingerly stepping into the mist. The cold went up another few notches. My teeth were chattering uncontrollably, and every muscle was frozen to a standstill. I had little choice but to keep watching as the rest of her body followed, twisting like a serpent as it passed through the narrow opening. Frost began to climb up the bed and onto my mattress.

She was tall and lithe, her jet-black hair falling over her face and all the way to the floor. The only things visible were one unblinking eye, and that smile. She was clad only in a simple white *sari,* without a blouse in the traditional village style. Her bare abdomen was as pale as her face, almost chalk-white. I had heard female monsters and ghosts had their feet twisted around to face backwards, but her bare feet were as normal and unremarkable as mine.

Not that kind of monster, then.

Slowly, she stalked over to the bed. With every step closer, the cold settled deeper and deeper into my flesh. My eyes began to struggle to stay open. Frost was climbing onto my hands and feet now. I tried to open my mouth and scream for help, but my jaw might as well have been wired shut. The only thing that escaped my throat was a pathetic gasp. Even the stabbing warnings in my head had faded to a dull, meaningless roar.

Dimly, I felt her climb onto the bed, straddling me as she leaned closer and closer. Her fingers were colder than I even thought possible, as they gently wrapped around my chin and turned my face to gaze into hers.

“My, my, how you’ve grown.”

Her voice was low and rich, slippery like black ice. I felt my skin burn as frost spread from her fingers. I was practically hyperventilating now, rooted in place and helpless, but even that was growing difficult. My chest refused to rise. Breathing was becoming a struggle.

A losing struggle.

She let go of my face, running her hands teasingly over my biceps. They left a trail of chilling pins and needles.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to kill you. Not for now.”

She placed both hands on my chest, squeezing lightly. Some of the cold withdrew. I could almost breathe again. My eyes flitted between her gaze and the knife on the table. Only if I could somehow get to it…

“Stabbing a visitor? Now, now. That’s so rude.” This close, her eyes were a deep, almost blackish blue, like the dark underbellies of arctic oceans. “If I wanted to harm you, do you think I would have got past the defences so easily? Do you think I would have let you wake up at all?”

My voice was still non-functional, but she must have glimpsed the question in my gaze.

*“Why are you here, then?”*

“Why? To help you, of course. I’m your friend, *Thakur*. Don’t you remember? We’ve been friends for a long time.”

The frost was climbing up my arms, but even through the haze of cold, I recalled a few half-forgotten snatches. A pale face watching from the edge of the wall as I ran around the courtyard. Tossing a ball back and forth with a smiling woman in a white *sari*. Holding a pale hand as I trampled through the family grove.

Had she been this cold then too?

“Good friends correct each other when they’ve been bad.” Almost sensually, she drew herself across me, reaching with a slender hand towards the table and grasping the ring in two fingers. “You know nothing of Chhayagarh’s ways. In many ways, you’re still that little boy, ignorant of the world and its dangers. Only this time, the dangers actually exist, and they want your head. The old things of this world hold no grudges for the innocent transgressions of children. But you are a child no longer.”

She nestled closer, almost lying on top of me as she ran a lazy finger over my brow. Even though it was somewhat reduced, the cold was still barely survivable. An involuntary squeak escaped me.

“Your actions, your presence. They have weight. Meaning. And that makes them both dangerous and attractive. So, when you know nothing about your situation, it’s best to trust wise counsel.” She reached down and grabbed my left hand by the wrist, raising it so I could see as she deliberately placed the ring onto my index finger. “Wear the ring. At. All. Times.” She deliberately lingered on every word. “I believe that is what he told you, darling.”

As soon as it settled on my finger, the cold no longer had a hold on me. The stabbing in my head stopped. I could breathe freely again. Move freely. I tried to snatch my arm out of her grasp, but even at my full strength, she was far stronger.

She smirked at my attempts, continuing in a sultry lilt. “Cute. Your family name, its symbols, have power here. Power earned from a violent history. The things here have learned to fear that crest, even if they don’t fear its holder. It will protect you from the worst of it, until you can protect yourself. Remember that.”

She leaned down and kissed my forehead. Her lips were colder than anything I had ever felt, or probably will ever feel for the rest of my life. Frost spread at a blinding speed from them, growing and thickening until they covered my eyes with a solid, opaque mask.

“Good night, little boy. Sleep well. I’ll be watching you.”

Even blind, I felt her presence shift and leave the room. A few seconds later, the frost over my face cracked, disappearing in moments like quicksilver. The room was back to its normal temperature again, the frost gone. Even the window had been repaired, the pieces held together by a meticulous webbing of ice.

For what felt like years, I lay in that bed. Despite the cool weather, sweat poured freely until the mattress was damp. I tried to cry, but even the tears wouldn’t come. I was too terrified for that.

Then, just as suddenly, I bolted upright and got to my feet. I pulled on a shirt, leaving everything else where it was. Packing and taking the luggage would arouse suspicion.

I had to go. Now.

The house was dark and empty when I left the room, with only the knife in my pocket. The servants were all in the outer part of the manor. Asleep. Only the family slept in the inner bedrooms. Neither my uncle nor my grandmother had been woken by the commotion.

Good.

No one noticed me leave the house. No one noticed as I crossed over the vast estate and silently slid out of the gate. Even the *lathials* were asleep in these wee hours, hugging their sticks to their chests. I had no idea how long it took to walk from the house to the edge of the village. It was a dazed blur. My head was empty of any thought, any instinct, except the feeling that I had to get away. I saw only the road in front of me. I felt only the steady thuds of my feet hitting the ground. I had forgotten to get my shoes. I was still in my house slippers.

Damn it.

A few villagers saw me, mostly young ones out with friends for late-night camaraderie. A few curious looks. But no one stopped or questioned me.

Perhaps they, too, were afraid of the ring. Or it might have been the blank stare.

It only felt like seconds later that the tea shop and the road loomed into view, the familiar pillars opposite it denoting the bus stop. It was not dawn yet, but the sky was beginning to lighten. The shop was still closed and shuttered. It probably would not open for a few days now.

Despite that, the bus driver was outside, sipping tea from a flask on one of the benches. He looked up when I approached. Unlike last time, he was wearing sunglasses that covered his eyes.

“Hey, kiddo. I ended up staying the night. There were no more passengers on the route.”

“Why are you wearing glasses?” I managed. “Something wrong with your eyes?”

He lowered them a little to stare at me, letting me see the inky darkness. “Just a fashion choice. You people are not the only ones who like to dress up. But what about you? Going somewhere?”

“When do you leave?”

He looked at his bus, still parked in the same spot. “In a few hours, I suppose. Why?”

“Take me with you. Take me back. I can’t stay here.” I clenched my fists, nails digging into my palms. “I can’t.”

He looked at me for a few heartbeats. “No.”

“No? What do you mean, no?”

“You can’t leave. Not now.”

“I’ll pay you. How much do you want?” I clenched so hard that the nails drew blood. “Hell, I’ll give you the entire estate if you want. Just get me out of here!”

“Tempting. But you shouldn’t make offers like that lightly. You have no idea of what you may end up giving away.”

“Look—”

“Ssh!” He raised a finger to his lips. “Stop talking. You can feel it, can’t you?”

“Feel what?”

No sooner had the question left my lips than I felt what he was referring to. That sense I was slowly becoming familiar with. Dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of eyes. Unseen. All fixed on me.

“The coming of a new *Thakur* is a momentous time. A crucial upheaval, especially in circumstances like yours.” He lowered his hand, taking another sip of the tea. “The land bucks like an unruly horse. Old boundaries, old laws, old understandings, all become ephemeral. They are watching you. All of them. Human and inhuman alike. Getting your measure. If you try to run now… They will know you as a coward. Forever.”

“Better that than knowing me as a dead man.”

He sighed. “You don’t understand, do you? For now, the reputation, the legend around you, keeps the smart ones among them at bay. If you shatter that image, they’ll pounce. You get on that bus with me, and you won’t live to see the next village.”

My heart skipped a beat at those words. “But… you can hold them off, can’t you? Like you did with the Spirals?”

“Maybe. There are many fish in this ocean, and though I don’t mean to brag, I’m one of the bigger ones. But a favour costs nothing. On the other hand, seeking my help yourself? Asking for it when I don’t mean to provide it? That’s a different thing altogether. That kind of support does not come cheap. There will be a bargain, and you won’t like what I take. But even if you agree, even if I help you, even if you escape…” He sipped casually at the tea again. “There will be consequences.”

“That’s what you keep saying.” I wanted to get pissy again, but I remembered the cloaked man’s warning. These things were quick to anger, and slow to forgiveness. “But what do you mean by that?”

“You have no idea of the power you hold, do you? The *Thakur* is not just the lord of Chhayagarh, kiddo. He is its protector. More importantly, he is its gaoler.”

“Protector? Gaoler?” When one asks for an answer, one does not mean to be confused even more by it. But I refrained from making those feelings known to him.

“It is by your strength, your presence, your actions, that this world draws strength against the other one. This village sits on ancient land, where monsters crawl out of the crevices and morasses beyond the veil. It is powerful beyond reckoning, even to existences like mine.” He finished his tea and set the cup aside.

“That is why your family was given this village, young lord. Since your first generations, you have served to stem the tide, to hold fast against the horrors that stalk in the night, to intercede and mediate and solve disputes on the boundaries where the real and unreal collide. Just by being here, you shore up the defences. You keep those who wish to hurt at bay, and you give those who wish to help a focus to rally behind. And you hold up the boundaries that keep them on this land. You disallow their escape. You prevent them from tormenting the rest of the world.”

“Our family? Why us?” I managed to stammer out.

There were a thousand questions running through my mind, but that one came hurtling out before all the others. It was a selfish one. But be honest. Could you really blame me for being angry at being saddled with such a responsibility out of the blue?

“That, I cannot say. But I know it is your sworn duty. You are dam, bridge, and fortress against the other side. If you leave now, when your influence is at its weakest… the walls will break down. Your power will collapse. Your family, everyone in the village, will be left unprotected. And the slaughter won’t stop with them. It will carry on. It will swallow village after village, town after town, city after city. Thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions will die. And death is one of the better outcomes in this situation. There are things that can do worse.”

“Can’t anyone else stop them?”

“There are others, like you, out there. More competent ones. I’m sure they will eventually get it under control. But are you sure you want to be responsible for whatever happens in the meantime?”

I staggered over and collapsed on the bench beside him, burying my head in my hands. I tried to say a million things, but only one choked phrase made it out.

“I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do.”

“Go back, kiddo. Get some sleep.”

The sky was beginning to lighten to a faded blue by now. Dawn was coming.

“It was a mistake to come here in the first place. They have smelled weakness. Don’t make it worse by letting them see your tears. The day is safer, especially now that you have the ring. Go back now, before anyone notices you’re missing.” He screwed the cap back onto the flask and rose to his feet, starting towards the bus. “Best of luck. You’ll need it.”

I raised my head, watching his rapidly retreating figure disappear into the driver’s cabin. A few moments later, his head poked out of the window.

“Oh, cheer up. I’ll bring you something nice from my next trip to town. No charge.”

After he drove off, I got to my feet and headed back to the manor. The sun was almost halfway over the horizon when I made it to my room. I tried to go to sleep, but my eyes just wouldn’t close anymore. So, I got back up and typed this out. I can hear people beginning to stir in the house, now that it’s dawn.

I don’t know how much of what the bus guy told me is correct or completely accurate. But in case even a sliver of it is true, I can’t take the chance. There is no way I can leave. At least, not until I figure this place out and stop whatever is hunting us. Both the woman and the driver (I suppose I should call him the ferryman, shouldn’t I?) said that fear of our family keeps the things here in line. Well, whatever this creature is, it isn’t afraid of us.

I have no heir yet. If it kills me too, if no one is left to carry the family line forward…

I don’t know what happens. But it can’t be good.

As I write these last few lines, I can feel a little bit of drowsiness coming back to me. Just as well. I think I’ll sleep in for a bit, and have a late breakfast. Grandmother would be disappointed, but I have little choice in the matter.

After all, I have a long day [ahead](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/comments/1fqrllm/index_welcome_to_chhayagarh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)."

# Details

# The First Chapter In The Poiesis Strings Series Is Here

Sonora Cinematic love organic textures and they love extended techniques: this is why they made Poiesis Cello. Poiesis Cello will allow you to instantly create beautiful (or beautifully ugly!) soundscapes that will inspire new music the first time you touch the keyboard.

**The Sound**

Poiesis cello was recorded in a dry studio with three high-end microphones placed relatively close to the instrument, to offer an intimate sound that you can shape as you please.

The microphones used are a Neumann U87 large diaphragm condenser (LDC), an AEA R84A ribbon (RBN) and a Schoeps CMC/mk4 small diaphragm condenser (SDC).A pre-rendered stereo mix (MIX) with the single microphones in LCR position and additional processing is also included and it provides a ready-to-use, resource-friendly way to obtain a great sound, right out of the box.

The instrument recorded is a 1995 Moes & Moes cello built for and owned by Yo-Yo Ma and played by Alan Black, principal cellist with the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra.

**The Patches**

Poiesis Cello features two different patches:

Textures is a two-layer instrument that allows you to choose between any of the 43 included articulations for each of the layers and freely crossfade between them using your keyboard’s mod-wheel (midi CC#1).

Shorts is a complementary patch that features three velocity-sensitive short articulations sampled with 5 round robins and 3 dynamic layers (+ snap pizz. on the pizzicato articulation.

Posting Part 4 Here For Now,chhayagarh,1fvxxog,2024-10-04 08:28:14,11,0.93,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/comments/1fvxxog/posting_part_4_here_for_now/,BuddhaTheGreat,,"UPDATE: [This part has been reposted to the subreddit with slight edits](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/comments/1fw4rhk/part_4_will_be_reposted/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). None of the substantive content has changed much, but either way, I will let this version stay up here. I would highly encourage you to read and engage on the main post, though.

(As you all know, Part 4 on the nosleep subreddit had been taken down about a day after it was posted. There has been no turnaround on its restoration yet, so I thought I would put it here so people could at least read it. The series will still remain on hiatus until the situation is sorted)

I tried to run. I know. Bad idea. But most of you haven’t felt what I felt that night. At least, I hope you haven’t. For your own sake.

There is little in the world that is more terrifying than your heart wrenching with fear as you lie in bed, drenched in your own sweat, eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling. Keenly aware of your own mortality. Any man, anyone, any living thing, would want to get away from anything that makes them feel that way. So, I ran.

Alright, I should probably slow down. Start where I left off [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fqrdir/chhayagarh_meet_the_family_and_the_monster/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

By the way, I thought I should provide you guys with an easy way to keep track of these experiences, if only to have a neat little log of my death throes. So, I made an index on its own dedicated subreddit. I’ll keep updating it as and when I post, so check back every so often if you’re interested. In the meantime, if you want to discuss anything, feel free to drop a post or two there. I’ll try to be involved, provided I’m not actively in the jaws of some monstrosity at that point. Check at the end for the link.

Anyway, after a refreshing afternoon siesta, it was time to meet my lawyer. I put on one of the clean white tunics the servants had left out while I was sleeping. As the evening fell, the air was growing chilly, and the wind was picking up across the open fields outside, so I had Bhanu bring me a shawl. Not carrying a good jacket or sweater had been an oversight. I had completely forgotten how cold it could get in these remote places at night, even outside of winter.

What I did not forget was to swipe Ramu’s knife off the table and stick it in one of my pockets. I was not making the mistake of being unarmed, even inside the house.

My uncle was waiting for me as I threw the shawl around my shoulders and descended the stairs. He was similarly dressed in a woollen shawl and a tunic, his smile in its usual place.

“Now you look the part, kid. All that shirt and jeans bullshit won’t fly in this house.”

I chuckled, picking at the edges of the shawl. “I almost feel like I belong here. Part of the scenery, you know? Almost.”

“Hey. This is your home.” He walked up and grabbed my shoulder. “That remains true, no matter how many years you spend away from it. Your father did what he thought was best when he left. I don’t blame him. But even he always felt its pull. Whenever something went wrong, he would be on his way here the next day. We never even needed to call. He just felt it, and he came back.”

“He came back. And he died.”

He nodded. “And he died.”

“What happened that night, *kaku*? I deserve to know.”

“You do.” He sighed and took his hand off my shoulder, turning his back to me. “But I cannot tell you. He never discussed it with me, though I asked. Not with any of us. Only your grandfather knows what truly happened. At least, he knew.”

“I see.”

“I’m sorry.” He looked back at me. “This place has painful connotations for you, as it has for all of us. You did not want to come back, and I can understand why. But you’re here now. And you’re family. Our family. All of us are with you. Whatever this is… we can handle it. We always have.”

I stepped closer to him. “Grandfather could not do it, and he knew this land from birth.”

“And through him, and us, so will you.” He faced me again. “On that note, we must speak soon. About the situation here. You’ve had enough excitement for one day, but tomorrow, come find me. There is information to cover. There are rituals to be performed. The coming of a new *Thakur* is a crucial time. Nothing can go wrong.”

“I don’t understand.”

“It’ll all make sense eventually. Trust me, kid.” He gestured at the hallway. “The lawyer’s in the study. You should go see him now. He’ll explain the mundane side of things to you. Property, finances. You know it better than me.”

“That makes one thing.” I sighed. “Thanks, uncle. By the way, where are the others?”

“My brothers? They’re out for tonight. Working. You’ll see them in the morning.” He gave me a small wave, nodding towards the study. “Go. Don’t want him to get mad.”

The study was exactly as I had left it in the vision. The only difference was the dust that hung like a thick pall over the room. Evidently, it had not been aired out or cleaned since the disappearance of its last owner. Mercifully, the power was on this time, so the chandelier-like light overhead was working, illuminating the room with a diffuse yellow glow.

A portly, balding man in a suit struggled out of one of the chairs when he saw me enter, extending a hand.

“Mr. Sen, so nice to finally meet you. My sincerest condolences about your grandfather.”

“Thank you.” I gestured at him to take his seat and took one of my own.

We faced each other across a small table.

“Mr. Sen, my name is Jacob Durham, of Durham and Co. Solicitors in Kolkata. I have worked closely with your grandfather for a long time. I was shocked to learn of his untimely demise. And in such a tragic manner too.”

I nodded. “It came as a shock to us all. Life has been a whirlwind ever since.”

“I imagine so.” He produced a briefcase from behind his chair and set it on the table. “Of course, the association between our firm and your family goes back much farther. We have worked with your estate for almost two centuries now, ever since 1825. My father, his father, and his father before him have all served your family. And now, I get to continue the line with you.”

“I understand you’re here with details about the inheritance.” I saw right through his attempts to create a sense of familiarity. It was a common trick of the trade. But with me, that relationship would have to be earned through competence.

“Indeed.” He sharply opened the briefcase and produced a few stacks of documents, lists, and diagrams. “I understand you are in our noble profession yourself. Good. Then this should not take as long as I feared.”

It still took several hours. I won’t bore you with the details, but it suffices to say that the implications are staggering. The manor and the surrounding lands were directly the personal possessions of the family, with some of it beyond the current boundaries leased out on long-term covenants to farmers. Beyond that, we held revenue rights and limited administrative rights over the entirety of the village land, as set out in the survey records he showed me. We also owned the forest behind the estate, as well as the mountain beyond it that served as the natural landmark before which Chhayagarh was built.

Okay, I should probably explain the forest. I told you the land was dry and hard, and that’s still true. But somehow, right at the base of the mountain, the place has managed to grow a lush, dense forest. Such vegetation density is not present anywhere else in the region. A part of the forest falls within our estate walls and contains the family grove, but most of it is outside, with only a narrow path winding through it to reach the steps that lead up the mountain. I theorize that the mountain caught what little rain the place gets and concentrated it there to allow the forest to grow, but knowing what I know now, there could have been some occult shit involved.

In any case, I found out that there were even more remote assets: townhouses in Kolkata and some other cities, satellite estates in the countryside, temple and shrine revenue, old hunting and lumber forests, business ventures, and even investment portfolios and commercial real estate. Even accounting for the maintenance and labour costs to keep everything functional, the property was raking in an absurd amount of money.

“Someone has been putting in the work to grow the pie,” I muttered, rifling through some deeds that described stakes in offshore oil blocks in the Americas.

“The family has been accumulating its assets for centuries, Mr. Sen. Usually, such estates lose a lot to mismanagement over the years, but I’m happy to report that such is not the case with yours.”

“A lot to keep track of.”

“I wouldn’t worry about it. Most of these assets are handled by a network of trusts and corporations with experienced administrators. Trustworthy ones. We have spent a lot of time perfecting the governance structure. I will send the documents over if you like, but the gist is that we can take care of maintaining and growing the estate. You need only decide how to best spend the windfall. Your family has always invested heavily in the village, both for welfare and other, more esoteric purposes. Those ones, I never fully understood.”

“You and me both, Mr. Durham. You and me both.”

He shrugged lightly. “I’m not paid to ask questions. In any case, if you ever need anything from the estate, let me know. We’ll make it happen.”

One of you had prompted me to think about the legal status of our *zamindari* all the way back in my first post, so I took the opportunity to pop the question.

“Ah.” Durham scratched his chin, smiling. “That’s a good question, Mr. Sen. Actually, there are laws on the books specifically about Chhayagarh, ever since the British administration. But we think these laws are based on even older laws. We have found *firmans* from the Sultans and the Mughals specifically protecting your family’s rights over this village, and decrees from the Hindu and Buddhist kings before them. They’re really obscure and difficult to retrieve. Almost redacted. But these laws all exempt this village from any land redistribution laws or other such measures. We keep checking periodically to see if all is in order, but in short, your family’s right over this inheritance is specifically and particularly protected by legislation. It has been so for as long as we have records.”

“Why were these laws passed?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“We are not aware. Maybe your family lobbied for them. Maybe the government had reasons of its own. Either way, the better for you and the worse for them.” He replaced the papers in his suitcase, leaving only a few out for me to sign. “Feel free to go through these. They will confirm the estate handover, the continuance of the governance structure, and other procedural things. All routine.”

It took about half an hour more until I was done reading and signing. Then Durham took the papers and replaced them in his case. Despite the name, he looked as native as I did, so I guessed he must have had some English blood somewhere up the tree.

“Now, as for the personal possessions your grandfather left you…” He rose to his feet and crossed over to a corner behind me. “Excuse me.”

When he returned, he held three parcels of varying sizes, as well as a sturdy wooden walking stick. “I had sealed these for safekeeping in my custody when I was instructed to, in accordance with your grandfather’s instructions. I warrant that no one has tampered with them since I retrieved them, though I cannot know what happened prior to my arrival.”

I nodded. He was a little too formal with me, given his advanced age. “So, these are the articles he left me?”

“Indeed. Firstly…” He handed me the stick. “Your grandfather’s walking stick. It has apparently been a long-time family heirloom, used by eight *Thakurs* before you. He wanted you to have it. Use it if you wish.”

I raised it to the light, studying it. I recognized the gnarly top, the darkish wood, and the simple metal tip at the bottom. Not just because I had seen it in that fateful vision. I remembered it well from my childhood: the telltale, comforting clacks echoing through the halls, indicating my grandfather on his regular rounds through the house.

“Then, we have this.” He opened one of the packages and handed me a gold-and-black ring, decorated with heraldry: a circular shield with a ribbon framing it, crossed over by a sword and a torch. Two lions held it up on either side. There was no motto.

“That is your family crest. This ring has been used as a symbol of office by the head of your family since time immemorial. I recommend you keep it and wear it all the time. It is both priceless and timeless.”

I slipped it onto my left index finger. It fit snugly; in fact, it may have been the light playing tricks on me, but I could have sworn I saw it shift and change size, adapting to my measurements.

“A natural fit. Truly, you boys are born into this role.” Durham gave me a polite smile, before moving on to the next package. “You own all the books in the family libraries and archives anyway, but your grandfather specifically insisted I hand this one over to your hands only. It took a while to track down. He had it in a bank locker all the way out in Singapore.”

He handed me a worn book. There was no title or name on the cover, but from looks alone, that was not surprising. It wasn’t a novel. It was a journal.

“This book was not listed in the preservation records of the family chronicles. I had no idea it even existed a few weeks ago, except that I perhaps saw your grandfather writing in it once. But that was many years ago.”

“What does it say?” I turned it around in my hands, hoping some clue would appear to explain it all. Unfortunately, there was nothing.

Durham gave me a crisp and incredulous laugh. “Mr. Sen, you must think me an amateur if you are implying that I would rifle through my client’s possessions. Please, find out at your own leisure. In any case…” He unwrapped the last package.

It revealed a simple golden necklace, completely unadorned. The pendant held nothing except one large, whitish stone. It was almost like a pearl, but the texture was off.

“What is that?” I raised an eyebrow.

“I have no idea. I only found out about it when your grandfather told me to secure it in his study after he was gone. He was extremely insistent that you wear it at all times.”

“This thing?” It did not go with my fashion at all, to be honest.

He shrugged again. “It’s yours now, Mr. Sen. Wear it. Kick it. Burn it. Your call. But he really was very insistent when he called me up about it, the night he disappeared.”

I perked up at that. “He called you that night?”

“Yes, shortly before he set out, from what I heard. That’s when he told me to facilitate the transfer of the estate to you and hold onto these articles. For if… when something happened.”

“He knew? That he was going to…”

“He said it was a possibility.” Durham sighed. “Your grandfather did this often, you know. Planning for his own death. It wasn’t even the first time this year that I had received such a call. I know he did something dangerous. Something to do with this place. But he never let me in on the details. I never thought… I never thought it would be real this time.” He sighed again, pressing his fingers to his temples.

“Sounds like you were really close.” More to placate him than anything else, I slipped on the necklace right then and there. “I’m sorry.”

“Family is family, Mr. Sen. Your loss far outstrips mine.” He got to his feet, slowly buttoning his coat. “Now, it is getting rather late. That more or less concludes our business. If you have any more questions, I am here till tomorrow afternoon. If there’s something after that, well… I’m always just a phone call away. Though your grandfather preferred his letters. Either works for me.”

I got to my feet as well, and we shook hands. “Good night, Mr. Durham, and thank you. For everything.”

After this, dinner was another blur. Durham took his food in his room, I was told. I talked with my grandmother and uncle. Just polite chitchat, nothing important. I think paying some compensation to Ramu’s father was discussed. My uncle said he would take care of it. Servants were whirling in and out, replacing dishes and utensils. But my mind was elsewhere. On the ring, on the book, on the necklace. On the walking stick, of all things.

Why did my grandfather think I needed to have these things? And these things in particular?

Despite my curiosity, I found quickly that I was in no condition to burn the midnight oil. My eyes began drooping almost as soon as I entered the bedroom. The day had taken its toll. The journal would have to wait for tomorrow, I told myself. I took the ring off and placed it on the nightstand, alongside the knife. I was about to do the same with the necklace, but as soon as I touched the clasp, my fingers tingled. A sense of impending danger stabbed into my skull like a knife. I decided to leave it where it was.

Thank the gods for that.

It was late when I snapped awake.  The power had gone out again, but the room was still cool. The nights could get downright chilly here. That was not something to be concerned about.

What was concerning was that it was getting colder, and fast. My breath was beginning to mist, and the metal bedframe was icy to the touch. The cold was almost alive, malicious even, as it wormed its way deep into my body. I had never experienced it myself, but I imagined this is what people who fell into frozen lakes felt. Cold, deeper and stronger than anything they had ever felt before.

My joints barely moved, as if stuck in jelly. Soon, frost began to form on the ceiling, slowly inching its way outwards and down the walls.

The only warm thing in the room was the necklace. Hell, it was scorching, like an open flame against my collarbone. At that moment, I was almost afraid I would soon start smelling burning flesh. Heat and cold. What a way to die.

The same overwhelming sense of danger stabbed over and over into my brain, seeming to point towards the only window in the room. It was on the far wall from the door, behind and to the side of the bed. Slowly, forcing my neck to work through the chill, I turned my head to look at it.

The room I had been furnished with had no balcony of its own. The only thing outside that window was a thin ledge, mostly decorative, though workers could attach scaffolding to it if they needed to do repairs. At the moment, no repairs are required.

But all the same, there was a face pressed against the window. A pale woman with long dark hair cascading past her shoulders. She had a small smirk on her face, staring right at me through the glass. The stabbing pain in my head reached a new fever pitch. The necklace positively throbbed with heat, in tune with my quickening heartbeat.

The window was locked, held in place by two heavy deadbolts. For now, those seemed to be in place. The woman had noticed my gaze upon her. Her smirk split into a full-on smile and she leaned closer and planted a small kiss on the glass. Frost radiated outwards from her lips, crackling as it spread.

I could feel my pupils dilate in panic. The cold was reaching an intolerable level now, deadening every inch of skin. I tried to sit up, but my muscles were spasming, working slowly and hesitantly. Or not at all.

The window was completely frosted now, with only a translucent outline of the woman outside visible. I saw her raise her hand and touch it.

Then, the thick glass exploded inwards, scattering shards all over the floor. The cool night air blew in, chilling the air even more. Along with it came thick, billowing mist, covering the floor and furniture until it looked more like a swamp than a room.

A bare, slender leg extended through the ragged hole in the window, almost gingerly stepping into the mist. The cold went up another few notches. My teeth were chattering uncontrollably, and every muscle was frozen to a standstill. I had little choice but to keep watching as the rest of her body followed, twisting like a serpent as it passed through the narrow opening. Frost began to climb up the bed and onto my mattress.

She was tall and lithe, her jet-black hair falling over her face and all the way to the floor. The only things visible were one unblinking eye, and that smile. She was clad only in a simple white *sari,* without a blouse in the traditional village style. Her bare abdomen was as pale as her face, almost chalk-white. I had heard female monsters and ghosts had their feet twisted around to face backwards, but her bare feet were as normal and unremarkable as mine.

Not that kind of monster, then.

Slowly, she stalked over to the bed. With every step closer, the cold settled deeper and deeper into my flesh. My eyes began to struggle to stay open. Frost was climbing onto my hands and feet now. I tried to open my mouth and scream for help, but my jaw might as well have been wired shut. The only thing that escaped my throat was a pathetic gasp. Even the stabbing warnings in my head had faded to a dull, meaningless roar.

Dimly, I felt her climb onto the bed, straddling me as she leaned closer and closer. Her fingers were colder than I even thought possible, as they gently wrapped around my chin and turned my face to gaze into hers.

“My, my, how you’ve grown.”

Her voice was low and rich, slippery like black ice. I felt my skin burn as frost spread from her fingers. I was practically hyperventilating now, rooted in place and helpless, but even that was growing difficult. My chest refused to rise. Breathing was becoming a struggle.

A losing struggle.

She let go of my face, running her hands teasingly over my biceps. They left a trail of chilling pins and needles.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to kill you. Not for now.”

She placed both hands on my chest, squeezing lightly. Some of the cold withdrew. I could almost breathe again. My eyes flitted between her gaze and the knife on the table. Only if I could somehow get to it…

“Stabbing a visitor? Now, now. That’s so rude.” This close, her eyes were a deep, almost blackish blue, like the dark underbellies of arctic oceans. “If I wanted to harm you, do you think I would have got past the defences so easily? Do you think I would have let you wake up at all?”

My voice was still non-functional, but she must have glimpsed the question in my gaze.

*“Why are you here, then?”*

“Why? To help you, of course. I’m your friend, *Thakur*. Don’t you remember? We’ve been friends for a long time.”

The frost was climbing up my arms, but even through the haze of cold, I recalled a few half-forgotten snatches. A pale face watching from the edge of the wall as I ran around the courtyard. Tossing a ball back and forth with a smiling woman in a white *sari*. Holding a pale hand as I trampled through the family grove.

Had she been this cold then too?

“Good friends correct each other when they’ve been bad.” Almost sensually, she drew herself across me, reaching with a slender hand towards the table and grasping the ring in two fingers. “You know nothing of Chhayagarh’s ways. In many ways, you’re still that little boy, ignorant of the world and its dangers. Only this time, the dangers actually exist, and they want your head. The old things of this world hold no grudges for the innocent transgressions of children. But you are a child no longer.”

She nestled closer, almost lying on top of me as she ran a lazy finger over my brow. Even though it was somewhat reduced, the cold was still barely survivable. An involuntary squeak escaped me.

“Your actions, your presence. They have weight. Meaning. And that makes them both dangerous and attractive. So, when you know nothing about your situation, it’s best to trust wise counsel.” She reached down and grabbed my left hand by the wrist, raising it so I could see as she deliberately placed the ring onto my index finger. “Wear the ring. At. All. Times.” She deliberately lingered on every word. “I believe that is what he told you, darling.”

As soon as it settled on my finger, the cold no longer had a hold on me. The stabbing in my head stopped. I could breathe freely again. Move freely. I tried to snatch my arm out of her grasp, but even at my full strength, she was far stronger.

She smirked at my attempts, continuing in a sultry lilt. “Cute. Your family name, its symbols, have power here. Power earned from a violent history. The things here have learned to fear that crest, even if they don’t fear its holder. It will protect you from the worst of it, until you can protect yourself. Remember that.”

She leaned down and kissed my forehead. Her lips were colder than anything I had ever felt, or probably will ever feel for the rest of my life. Frost spread at a blinding speed from them, growing and thickening until they covered my eyes with a solid, opaque mask.

“Good night, little boy. Sleep well. I’ll be watching you.”

Even blind, I felt her presence shift and leave the room. A few seconds later, the frost over my face cracked, disappearing in moments like quicksilver. The room was back to its normal temperature again, the frost gone. Even the window had been repaired, the pieces held together by a meticulous webbing of ice.

For what felt like years, I lay in that bed. Despite the cool weather, sweat poured freely until the mattress was damp. I tried to cry, but even the tears wouldn’t come. I was too terrified for that.

Then, just as suddenly, I bolted upright and got to my feet. I pulled on a shirt, leaving everything else where it was. Packing and taking the luggage would arouse suspicion.

I had to go. Now.

The house was dark and empty when I left the room, with only the knife in my pocket. The servants were all in the outer part of the manor. Asleep. Only the family slept in the inner bedrooms. Neither my uncle nor my grandmother had been woken by the commotion.

Good.

No one noticed me leave the house. No one noticed as I crossed over the vast estate and silently slid out of the gate. Even the *lathials* were asleep in these wee hours, hugging their sticks to their chests. I had no idea how long it took to walk from the house to the edge of the village. It was a dazed blur. My head was empty of any thought, any instinct, except the feeling that I had to get away. I saw only the road in front of me. I felt only the steady thuds of my feet hitting the ground. I had forgotten to get my shoes. I was still in my house slippers.

Damn it.

A few villagers saw me, mostly young ones out with friends for late-night camaraderie. A few curious looks. But no one stopped or questioned me.

Perhaps they, too, were afraid of the ring. Or it might have been the blank stare.

It only felt like seconds later that the tea shop and the road loomed into view, the familiar pillars opposite it denoting the bus stop. It was not dawn yet, but the sky was beginning to lighten. The shop was still closed and shuttered. It probably would not open for a few days now.

Despite that, the bus driver was outside, sipping tea from a flask on one of the benches. He looked up when I approached. Unlike last time, he was wearing sunglasses that covered his eyes.

“Hey, kiddo. I ended up staying the night. There were no more passengers on the route.”

“Why are you wearing glasses?” I managed. “Something wrong with your eyes?”

He lowered them a little to stare at me, letting me see the inky darkness. “Just a fashion choice. You people are not the only ones who like to dress up. But what about you? Going somewhere?”

“When do you leave?”

He looked at his bus, still parked in the same spot. “In a few hours, I suppose. Why?”

“Take me with you. Take me back. I can’t stay here.” I clenched my fists, nails digging into my palms. “I can’t.”

He looked at me for a few heartbeats. “No.”

“No? What do you mean, no?”

“You can’t leave. Not now.”

“I’ll pay you. How much do you want?” I clenched so hard that the nails drew blood. “Hell, I’ll give you the entire estate if you want. Just get me out of here!”

“Tempting. But you shouldn’t make offers like that lightly. You have no idea of what you may end up giving away.”

“Look—”

“Ssh!” He raised a finger to his lips. “Stop talking. You can feel it, can’t you?”

“Feel what?”

No sooner had the question left my lips than I felt what he was referring to. That sense I was slowly becoming familiar with. Dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of eyes. Unseen. All fixed on me.

“The coming of a new *Thakur* is a momentous time. A crucial upheaval, especially in circumstances like yours.” He lowered his hand, taking another sip of the tea. “The land bucks like an unruly horse. Old boundaries, old laws, old understandings, all become ephemeral. They are watching you. All of them. Human and inhuman alike. Getting your measure. If you try to run now… They will know you as a coward. Forever.”

“Better that than knowing me as a dead man.”

He sighed. “You don’t understand, do you? For now, the reputation, the legend around you, keeps the smart ones among them at bay. If you shatter that image, they’ll pounce. You get on that bus with me, and you won’t live to see the next village.”

My heart skipped a beat at those words. “But… you can hold them off, can’t you? Like you did with the Spirals?”

“Maybe. There are many fish in this ocean, and though I don’t mean to brag, I’m one of the bigger ones. But a favour costs nothing. On the other hand, seeking my help yourself? Asking for it when I don’t mean to provide it? That’s a different thing altogether. That kind of support does not come cheap. There will be a bargain, and you won’t like what I take. But even if you agree, even if I help you, even if you escape…” He sipped casually at the tea again. “There will be consequences.”

“That’s what you keep saying.” I wanted to get pissy again, but I remembered the cloaked man’s warning. These things were quick to anger, and slow to forgiveness. “But what do you mean by that?”

“You have no idea of the power you hold, do you? The *Thakur* is not just the lord of Chhayagarh, kiddo. He is its protector. More importantly, he is its gaoler.”

“Protector? Gaoler?” When one asks for an answer, one does not mean to be confused even more by it. But I refrained from making those feelings known to him.

“It is by your strength, your presence, your actions, that this world draws strength against the other one. This village sits on ancient land, where monsters crawl out of the crevices and morasses beyond the veil. It is powerful beyond reckoning, even to existences like mine.” He finished his tea and set the cup aside.

“That is why your family was given this village, young lord. Since your first generations, you have served to stem the tide, to hold fast against the horrors that stalk in the night, to intercede and mediate and solve disputes on the boundaries where the real and unreal collide. Just by being here, you shore up the defences. You keep those who wish to hurt at bay, and you give those who wish to help a focus to rally behind. And you hold up the boundaries that keep them on this land. You disallow their escape. You prevent them from tormenting the rest of the world.”

“Our family? Why us?” I managed to stammer out.

There were a thousand questions running through my mind, but that one came hurtling out before all the others. It was a selfish one. But be honest. Could you really blame me for being angry at being saddled with such a responsibility out of the blue?

“That, I cannot say. But I know it is your sworn duty. You are dam, bridge, and fortress against the other side. If you leave now, when your influence is at its weakest… the walls will break down. Your power will collapse. Your family, everyone in the village, will be left unprotected. And the slaughter won’t stop with them. It will carry on. It will swallow village after village, town after town, city after city. Thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions will die. And death is one of the better outcomes in this situation. There are things that can do worse.”

“Can’t anyone else stop them?”

“There are others, like you, out there. More competent ones. I’m sure they will eventually get it under control. But are you sure you want to be responsible for whatever happens in the meantime?”

I staggered over and collapsed on the bench beside him, burying my head in my hands. I tried to say a million things, but only one choked phrase made it out.

“I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do.”

“Go back, kiddo. Get some sleep.”

The sky was beginning to lighten to a faded blue by now. Dawn was coming.

“It was a mistake to come here in the first place. They have smelled weakness. Don’t make it worse by letting them see your tears. The day is safer, especially now that you have the ring. Go back now, before anyone notices you’re missing.” He screwed the cap back onto the flask and rose to his feet, starting towards the bus. “Best of luck. You’ll need it.”

I raised my head, watching his rapidly retreating figure disappear into the driver’s cabin. A few moments later, his head poked out of the window.

“Oh, cheer up. I’ll bring you something nice from my next trip to town. No charge.”

After he drove off, I got to my feet and headed back to the manor. The sun was almost halfway over the horizon when I made it to my room. I tried to go to sleep, but my eyes just wouldn’t close anymore. So, I got back up and typed this out. I can hear people beginning to stir in the house, now that it’s dawn.

I don’t know how much of what the bus guy told me is correct or completely accurate. But in case even a sliver of it is true, I can’t take the chance. There is no way I can leave. At least, not until I figure this place out and stop whatever is hunting us. Both the woman and the driver (I suppose I should call him the ferryman, shouldn’t I?) said that fear of our family keeps the things here in line. Well, whatever this creature is, it isn’t afraid of us.

I have no heir yet. If it kills me too, if no one is left to carry the family line forward…

I don’t know what happens. But it can’t be good.

As I write these last few lines, I can feel a little bit of drowsiness coming back to me. Just as well. I think I’ll sleep in for a bit, and have a late breakfast. Grandmother would be disappointed, but I have little choice in the matter.

After all, I have a long day ahead. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/comments/1fqrllm/index_welcome_to_chhayagarh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

**Summary Of Last Earnings call:**

**Summary of NIKE, Inc. Fiscal 2025 Q1 Conference Call**

- **Participants & Structure**: Paul Trussell, Vice President of Corporate Finance, opened the call, followed by Matt Friend, Executive Vice President and CFO. The call focused on NIKE's fiscal 2025 first quarter results, with a reminder regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.

- **Leadership Transition**: The call addressed the upcoming retirement of President and CEO John Donahoe, effective October 14, 2023, and welcomed Elliott Hill as the new President and CEO. This transition has prompted NIKE to withdraw its full-year guidance, opting instead for quarterly guidance to allow Elliott time to assess current strategies and trends.

- **Q1 Financial Performance**:
  - **Revenue**: NIKE reported a 10% decline in revenue on a reported basis and a 9% decrease on a currency-neutral basis.
  - **Sales Channels**: NIKE Direct was down 12%, with NIKE stores slightly up by 1% and NIKE Digital down 20%. Wholesale revenue also declined by 7%.
  - **Margins**: Gross margins improved to 45.4% due to lower product and operational costs. SG&A expenses decreased by 2%.
  - **Earnings Per Share**: Diluted EPS was reported at $0.70.

- **Retail Traffic & Sales**: There was a notable decline in retail traffic, particularly in Greater China, where partner stores showed significant softness. Elevated inventory levels led to increased promotional activity.

- **Product Portfolio & Strategy**: NIKE is actively working to rebalance its product portfolio, with a notable reduction in revenues from classic footwear lines (Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1, Dunk) anticipated to continue negatively impacting overall revenues. However, management expressed optimism regarding the momentum in new product innovations, particularly in the running segment, and improved performance in footwear units.

- **Outlook for Q2**: NIKE expects Q2 revenues to decline by 8-10%, with gross margins projected to decrease by approximately 150 basis points due to increased promotions and mixed channel performance. SG&A is anticipated to remain flat compared to the previous year.

- **Regional Performance**:
  - **North America**: Revenue declined 11%, with challenges in both online and physical stores.
  - **EMEA**: Similarly, a 12% revenue decline, impacted by lower digital engagement.
  - **APLA**: Minor declines observed, with certain stores performing well.
  - **Greater China**: Revenue fell 3%, affected by declining digital sales despite strong wholesale performance.

- **Key Actions & Future Initiatives**: NIKE aims to foster 'better balance' in product offerings while enhancing engagement with retail partners. The introduction of innovative products should align with heightened consumer engagement, particularly through running events and athlete-driven campaigns.

- **Conclusion**: While facing current challenges, the company maintains a long-term optimistic outlook, especially in key markets like China and the running segment, emphasizing a commitment to innovation and strategic growth.

The call concluded with a Q&A session addressing specific concerns regarding inventory management, regional performance, and the effectiveness of direct-to-consumer initiatives.

**Chapter 291: Laundry Day**

Streams of tiny flags ran from rooftop to rooftop.

The town of Witschblume was certainly a colourful affair. What may have once been walls of sensible red bricks and faded wood were instead canvasses in their own right. 

As Apple bore me along a loosely cobbled road through the centre of this famed town, it was while trotting beneath a rainbow of pastel yellows, green and violet signboards. 

Even so, while the façades of the many storefronts and houses may be different, those hollering for my attention were not. No matter how far I travelled or how I bravely huddled away from every open window boasting a piano peeking over its edge, my regal aura was one which transcended distance.

And that meant a rare chance for the people of Ouzelia to shower their attention upon a true princess.

“Oh, Lady Uxna! Try this new cream for your heels! It’s made of soothing dewberry extract and elderflower vine! You can have a tub for free!”

“My lady, would you like to sit down and relax at my restaurant? It’s just reopened! I’ve a new lunch menu you can sample! Try everything, I insist! It’s all on me!”

“Madame Blood Shrieker! Come, come sample my new product! It’s a gleamroot elixir to make your hair shine like the moon! I happen to have a test crate with your name on it!”

“Lady Uxna, please notice meeee!”

Indeed!

The crowd simply could not get enough of me … via the maid escorting me by my side. 

As we navigated this market street teeming with commoners, merchants and oddballs, it was made all the busier by the throngs of curious admirers steadfastly avoiding eye contact with me as they instead sought to harass the ogre beside me. 

Seeing the looks of eagerness light up their faces as they directed it at someone else … I could only nod.

My, what a delightful surprise!

To think that despite my worst fears, the people here knew enough of etiquette to appropriately heckle my accompanying retinue instead!

True, they really shouldn’t be blocking my way to do it … in fact, they shouldn’t be pestering her at all, but rather going through Coppelia. But I could hardly blame them for the mishap.

After all– 

“I’ll take this, and that, and this, and that\~”

Coppelia was busy.

Unable to ward away the commoners threatening Apple’s hooves, she was instead reaching out and accepting every item being offered in the maid’s place. Within moments, her arms were laden with all the things necessary to compete with her library’s gift shop. 

As expected, my loyal handmaiden wasn’t to be caught idling. The more sources of income she secured, the greater the statement that she would not be undone in the face of somebody else’s retainer. 

And my, wasn’t this a rare one to earn a smidgeon of my interest?

Strange as it was to converse idly with maids, it was still acceptable if they were of notable birth or background. Just as this one’s title suggested.

A curious thing. Although I knew little of ogres and their ways, I at least understood they possessed better insults than to elevate their own with titles of nobility. That was just demeaning.

No … she’d been bestowed it by others.

“You appear popular with the people, Lady Uxna. I am grateful to have you as my escort.”

“Your words do me honour.” She offered a respectful nod, all the while pushing commoners aside by way of being larger than everyone else. “Allow me also to apologise for the commotion.”

“Oh? Whatever for?” 

“Witschblume is famed for its liveliness, but more so when I walk its streets. It is well known that I represent Duchess Cadence. My opinion is often sought after in the hope of securing her patronage.”

“A sentiment I’m all too familiar with, then. To be heaped with free gifts and adoration on top of being immensely wealthy is a terrible burden.”

“So it is,” said Lady Uxna politely.

I offered a smile while casually tugging Apple’s reins a little to the side. He snorted directly into a peasant reaching across with a bouquet of flowers, then gobbled said flowers.

“Might I ask how you came about your title? I confess I’m unfamiliar with the intricacies of ogre peerages.”

“That is because they do not exist. At least not in common form. Those most celebrated amongst our tribes mark their high status with the wreathed bones of our enemies and a face paint of their blood.”

“A subtle and dignified display. We could all learn from your example.”

“Thank you. I share similar sentiments. Be that as it may, Duchess Cadence saw fit to reward me with a title in keeping with local tradition, in recognition of my services to Witschblume.” 

“A gift as rare as it is to accept it. I know of ogres who have taken to the call of the sea. But none who have taken to the call of human nations.”

“Nor are you likely to. I still represent my tribe, albeit as part of a cultural exchange.” 

“A … cultural exchange?”

“It’s been remarkably enlightening. And not only for myself. I educate myself on the peculiars of local politics, while my exchange partner fights to the death in the Blood Pits.”

I gasped and covered my mouth.

To eschew fighting to the death in gladiatorial combat to instead die a slow and torturous death by boredom in the court was a sacrifice deserving of far more than a mere peerage!

“Is … Is that so? Goodness, your dedication to your tribe is quite commendable.”

“It is no great burden,” she said modestly. “There are hurdles, but few which cannot be overcome through perseverance and a show of a slightly pronounced molar. The formal title is helpful as well.” 

“A reflection of your character. As well as Duchess Cadence’s foresight.” 

“She is certainly known for her wisdom, yes. I hope that your meeting with her is productive.”

“As do I. Indeed, I’m most curious about what she wishes to discuss. Particularly as such short notice.”

“I’m afraid that is not for me to say. I was only requested to offer you an audience.”

I offered a polite smile.

After all, how could I not, while I was so keenly expected in another realm?

Yes, there were several problems. I wanted this visit to be swift, discreet and without fuss. The only things I desired along with everything I could possibly want. 

Instead, I could practically hear the scampering feet of our diplomats as they trembled at the prospect of this unscheduled meeting. And only partially to do with the fact that I was entirely unfamiliar with the minute details of foreign diplomacy.

But that’s fine!

I was learned in more than the ways of popular culture! Despite the valiant attempts of my siblings, it was only natural that I wouldn’t be wholly excluded from the drudgery of court life. I had little doubt I could represent the grace and dignity of my kingdom. 

All the more so since I was never here.

Indeed, it was clear that informality was very much the theme of this visit.

The lack of ceremony spoke as much as the fact that my escort was conscious not to use any mode of address. Yet more than her discretion was the fact this was no parade of banners, trumpets and knights clogging up the street. 

And that was proof I had little to fear. 

If Witschblume’s ruler wished to indulge in her curiosity, then who was I to deny it? 

Especially if she could help shorten my visit. 

“Your Duchess has keen eyes,” I said. “Only a short time ago, I myself did not even expect to be here.”

“Little occurs in Witschblume without Duchess Cadence’s knowledge. Particularly regarding princesses. Before the signing of the Queensholme Accords, it was expected that when a princess was taken by a dragon, it fell to the regional ruler to organise her rescue. Your sudden arrival sent no less than a dozen separate artifacts shattering the windows.”

I let out a tiny groan.

Of course. Ouzelia. The home of dragons. Where else would a way to detect rapidly arriving princesses be found if not in the place where they were all taken? For all I knew, there was an entire industry around it. If murder fog could be commercialised, then why not rescuing princesses?

“Goodness. My apologies, then. I shall ensure that somebody other than me compensates you. Rest assured, I am as much a victim as your windows are.”

“I’m certain the Duchess will understand. While I cannot know her mind or your purpose, I believe that windows are unlikely to be a topic of conversation. Not least since they break with regular frequency.”

I waited for context. Or a smile of inappropriate humour.

Neither came.

I shuddered instead, leaning away from every window as I searched for the silhouettes of my kingdom’s St. Liane exports teetering needlessly. Neither the unease nor my now permanently scrunched shoulders faded. But the gaggle of fawning merchants soon did.

As the cobbled street winded onwards, the rows of stalls and storefronts lessened, replaced by the sight of white walls rising high overhead. 

Witschblume castle looked rather like it had been plucked from a picture book. A quaint and charming sight, built clearly to host dignitaries rather than to withstand a siege. Neither the towers nor the ramparts were as grand or impressive as Reitzlake Castle. But it was worth a moment of admiration nonetheless.

I paused to appreciate the many arched windows. Each was stained with a different colour of the rainbow, the glass a mosaic of intricate patterns likely to be matched only by the finest of cathedrals.

*Pwsshhhhh*.

And then I saw an even more colourful sight.

A woven basket breaking through one of the delicate windows. 

As it flew, garments trailed behind it like streams of ribbons. Gowns, socks and puffy frocks. Fabrics of light hues to match the pastel nature of the town floated downwards as the basket rolled before us, empty except for the multiple shoes weighing it down.

Lady Uxna leaned down amidst the shower of garments and plucked out a note. 

I politely turned away. And then quickly peeked when she wasn’t looking.

*I hereby declare laundry outlawed,*

*Duchess Cadence*

Lady Uxna’s eyes were unmoving even as she read it.

After a moment, she turned to me with a look of apology.

“The Duchess is prone to decisions of fancy,” she said lightly. “Particularly in regards to her dislike of the maintenance of her attire. Please do not be concerned. She is diligent in matters of governance.”

I stared at all the garments as they lay scattered upon the cobbled road. 

And then I returned to the note.

This Duchess … why, she’d just outlawed laundry!

That was just absurd! … Or was it? 

If … If I did such a thing, it would mean the socks which didn’t exist on my floor would by definition no longer count as garments lazily strewn by the wayside! Rather, they’d be classified as discarded excess I had no expectation to neatly pile into a basket myself!

I gave a gasp as light filled my vision.

“W-What a revolutionary!”

Lady Uxna’s shoulders immediately drooped. Coppelia kindly reached up and patted her.

“Don’t worry, it only gets harder from here\~”

**Appearance**: Hamilton is a young looking man of average height and decent build. He has handsome sliver eyes and luscious brown hair that complements his fair skin. He wears a brown dress shirt with a white ribbon on his collar. Over this shirt he wears a long blue mantle which rests over his shoulders that has gold accents. This mantle is connected to baggy sleeves with gold cuffs. He also wears baggy blue pants with gold accents and star symbols. Keeping these pants up are a brown leather belt with a gold buckles and a gold star as an accessory. On his feet he wears brown boots with intricate patterns with a darker brown heels. He has belts wrapped around certain parts of his body, namely right arm and left leg that serve as an aesthetic choice and not as a practical one. Overall Hamilton, compared to others in the Einherjar, wears a more sophisticated and “casual” attire. He mostly has a reserved look on his face which matches his calm and collective character…for the most part.

**Lore**: Born out of wedlock between Rachel Lavien and James A. Hamilton on January 11, 1755, Alexander Hamilton would have a rough start in life as he and his older brother would be orphaned when their father abandoned them and their mother would pass away from yellow fever. He and his brother would even be separated but it wasn’t all bad for young Hamilton. The boy would be taken in by a prosperous merchant named Thomas Stevens he would give Hamilton a job as a clerk at Beekman and Cruger, a trading firm that did business with the Province of New York and New England. Hamilton would show himself to be a capable trader at only his teens as he was in charge of the firm for five months when the owner was over seas. Hamilton was quite the intelligent young man that he even impressed community leaders so much that they collected a fund to send Hamilton to the North American colonies for his education. Hamilton, being only 17, would arrive at Boston through ship and proceeded from there to New York City. 

After Hamilton had finished his education, he would enter Mulligan's alma mater King's College and from there on would be relatively smooth sailing through Hamilton’s college years. But one significant detail in Hamilton’s time at college would be the idea of revolting against the British and little did Hamilton know, the time of Revolution would soon come. April 19, 1775 would be the start of the American Revolution after the unfair treatment of the British to the Colonies, and in the same year, Hamilton and other King's College students joined the New York militia called the Corsicans. In this militia, Hamilton would not only show he wasn’t only book smart, he would show himself to be a skilled military leader and rise though the ranks being promoted to Captain of the New York Provincial Company of Artillery. Hamilton would certainly prove himself as he was invited to become an aide to Continental Army general William Alexander and Lord Stirling but Hamilton would refuse believing his best chance for improving his station in life was glory on the battlefields. But…eventually he would receive an invitation that he could not refuse…to serve as George Washington's aide with the rank of lieutenant colonel. As Washington’s aide, after 4 years Hamilton would fight in many battle in the name of Independence along with his brethren such as the Battle of Harlem Heights, Battle of White Plains, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth and the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781 where he commanded the Light Infantry Division. Hamilton would indeed show that he was a skilled general as the French allies to the British would suffer heavy losses against the Battalion. With these losses, the British would finally surrender as this moment of the War would be the final major battle and 2 years later, the British would depart from the United States as finally Independence was won. 

However Hamilton’s story wouldn’t be over yet as after the war, he would become a trusted member of the now President Washington's first cabinet and would serve as the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury  where he would create the First Bank of the United States. When all was said and done, he resigned from his role and would return to his regular business activities. But some Hamilton’s time would come early as he would be at odds with Aaron Burr who he saw as unprincipled but the last straw between their feud when Hamilton stated that Burr was unworthy of the role as New York Governor which Burr took great offense. Burr would challenge Hamilton to a duel and he would not back down. The duel began at dawn on July 11, 1804, along the west bank of the Hudson River on a rocky ledge in Weehawken, New Jersey…both their pistols drawn…before two shots would be heard…Hamilton’s shot missed Burr but Burr’s shot…was a direct hit…Hamilton would die from the bullet wound at 2 o'clock the following afternoon, July 12, 1804…but the Little Lion would be remembered as one of the Founding Fathers who built a nation that would thrive for many years…

**Personality**: Hamilton is a generally reserved and collective man who is quite intelligent, mostly in the business industry. He enjoys reading and writing along with being a fan of literature. He’s also a man of business who’s more than willing to talk things out with foes he believes can be negotiated with. He also has a slight disdain for the British but only those of his time as he acknowledges that the British have gotten better and not all Brits are the same. He even respects soldiers and warriors who are selfless and honorable. Speaking of which, Hamilton is a man of honor who is all for a fair fight and doesn’t employ any dirty tactics even if he’s desperate. As a general, he is a brilliant and self-confident leader being a man who is decisive and results-driven as he has no patience for fools. He is also more than willing to speak his mind and never sheds from conflict which plays that he can be a bit impulsive and hot headed. This can also lead him to he a little prideful but when the time calls for it, Hamilton can set aside his pride as above all things, he is a man of the people as he can prove himself to a be a selfless man who will fight to the bitter end for the greater good. 

**Fighting Style/Skills**: Hamilton, despite not being a master swordsmen, is still quite skilled with a saber and a great marksman. However his true strength lies in his leadership and intelligence. Hamilton is quite the strategist in the battlefield being able to formulate plans of attack in mere seconds! He’s also quite fast as his reaction time is near superhuman and, combined with his weapon of choice, he can deliver quick and deadly slashes. While Hamilton’s skills are limited…that shouldn’t mean you should underestimate him as arsenal and abilities, combined with his intellect, Hamilton is indeed a force to be reckoned with…

**Main Ability**:  

**Artillery Explosion**: While a cannon would be an impressive weapon to have in the battlefield, this ability allows Hamilton to channel the same explosive energy from a cannonball without the cannon. This energy flows through him as he can channel this energy into objects which can result in said object exploding. However Hamilton can only explode inanimate objects but even with that drawback, Hamilton is still quite the deadly opponent as combined with his intelligence, simple pebbles can become small shrapnel bombs, the entire battlefield can become a minefield, etc. How fitting for a man with such a fiery personality.

**Volundr/Equipment**:
* **Saber of the Revolution**: A simple saber is Hamilton’s weapon of choice and while this weapon may not have any special gimmicks, it’s how he uses it is what makes it special. Being made of a special metal from doing a Volundr with a Valkyrie, he can channel explosive energy into the sword and anything that makes contact with the blade will explode on impact which can cause critical damage on his opponent should he deliver a direct hit. But that’s not all as he can also launch a wave of explosive energy from the sword delivering an explosive impact equivalent to a cannonball. His intellect, his ability, and his weapon of choice…Hamilton is truly a formidable opponent.

**Ultimate Technique**: 

**FINAL DUEL, ONE BULLET**: Hamilton’s saber shifts from a sword into dueling pistol with a single bullet before he takes a stance as he turns his back to his opponent and suddenly…it’s as if time slows down in his perspective…slowly he begins to charge the bullet…he closes his eyes only hearing his breathing…1…2…3…Hamilton regains his senses as he quickly turns around to face his opponent before firing a direct shot into his opponent‘s head…killing them instantly without any time for them to react. This technique is his most high reward yet high risk as he can only use this attack once and can only use it if his opponent is weakened or far away. Regardless, this technique reflects a promise Hamilton made after death…to never miss again…

**Interactions**: 

**George Washington**: “Ah! Washington my good friend! It has been so long since we’ve seen each other! Oh? Hahaha don’t worry about me my friend, sure my life was cut short but the afterlife hasn’t been so bad. Besides I’ve had more time to work on my aim hehehe…oooh…”

**Aaron Burr**: “Oh…it’s you…long time no see I guess…you know Aaron…I’m still a little pissed about being killed by you of all people…however in life I’m a man of honor and respect you…but we’re no longer alive are we? *Without hesitation, Hamilton decks Burr in the face as he falls down flat on his face*…hmph asshole…”

**Napoleon Bonaparte**: “So the ‘Man who almost Conquered the World’ is it? I must say you’re definitely taller in person…then again I suppose a man who has such a title would definitely impress…granted you are a bit arrogant and ruled with an iron fist but with so many accomplishments…I suppose I can’t blame you…”

**Bobby Fischer**: “Damn…you beat me again Mr. Fischer. I never played chess that much in life…I focused more on reading and military tactics but never got around to playing it. I suppose I must practice more to not be a…what was the word you used? A…’noob?’” 

**Guy Fawkes**: “Tsh it’s people like you who I despise…an anarchic man who believes needless bloodshed is necessary in order to fulfill your agenda! Well then Fawkes I cannot stand you for I-*blinks once*-challenge you to-wait what? Where did he go?”

**Hades**: “Huh…so…you’re Hades? You look different from the scriptures…I mean…you clearly look like a man…or more like a little boy…oh? Oh! I suppose the stress of having to file in souls and figuring out their punishment and which Circle of Hell they go to must’ve regressed your appearance! Oh poor you…”

**Loki**: “Hmph you’re quite infamous you foul trickster…imagine…being hated by both Heaven and Humanity! And yet you’re so nonchalant about it as if you don’t care! Ugh you honestly disgust me and to think you’re a ‘divine’ god…well then Prince of Trickery…I challenge you to-*blinks once*-a duel-wait what?! DAMN IT NOT AGAIN!”

**Mammon**: “Huh…so this is what the Circle of Greed looks like here? Honestly it’s kinda sad that the Sinners here are essentially imprisoned in a Casino where they’re forced to keep on gambling only to lose again! While you secretly get all the money and gold…quite frankly it’s disgusting…”

Self-discovery is a personal revolution, and every sissy's beginning.

The paint on this canvas is yours to splash, and the only rules are the ones you set.

But where do you begin when the palette is every color under the sun, and the canvas the entirety of your essence?

Setting goals, my elegant experimenters, is the foundational garter belt to your sissy outfit.

Unraveling the 'Why'

Before a seamstress starts stitching, she knows the purpose of her creation. Your 'why' is more than a reason; it's the compass for your sissy escapade.

It could be to feel more confident, to express your femininity, or to challenge society's cages. Identify the pulsating reason behind your sissy development—this is the heartbeat of your goal-setting.

Stiletto-Stepping the SMART Way

We're goal diggers here, and we dig deep. Your sissy goals should be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

If it's too vague, you'll be twirling in circles; too ambitious, and you risk wardrobe malfunctions.

Tailoring Your Experience

One size does not fit all in sissy-dom. Your goals are bespoke, curated to flatter your figure and accentuate your qualities.

To walk this walk, you'll need to sew your ambitions with the threads of possibility and personalize them with ribbons of your personal style.

Sissy Budget

Adornments are abundant in the sissy's world, from lace fronts to lacy cups, but without a budget, your jewels may remain mothballed in the chest of your aspirations. Money makes the world go round, and it makes the wheels of your wig spin, too.

Coin for Your Contours

Lipsticks cost more than just lip service. Investing in quality items will be both a statement of your sissy seriousness and a foundation for your practice. Whether you're purchasing makeup, clothing, or hormone treatments, establish a monthly budget and stick to it.

Thrift Store—Your Fairy Godmother

Your finances are the fairy godmother to a sissy's outfit. Fortunately, the realm of sissy is secondhand heaven. Thrift stores, vintage markets, and online bazaars are treasure troves for statement pieces that won't make you a pauper.

Balancing Act

A sissy's budget is about balance. It's about prioritizing, saving, and not forgetting that while a tiara can make you feel like a queen, it's not the crown jewels. Ask yourself what's necessary, what's a luxury, and what can wait until the next payday.

The Sissy Journal: Documentation and Reflection

A sissy's transformation is a chronicle waiting to be written, and the sissy journal is the parchment where you ink your tale. It is the key to your development, a reflective mirror of who you were, who you are, and who you are becoming.

Scribbling Start

Begin with a notebook—digital or analog, it matters not. This will be your confidant, your witness, and your sissy-terhood.

What to Write

Document your outfits, your thoughts, your fears, your victories. Through writing, you'll uncover patterns, chart progress, and gain the courage to shimmy into the next chapter.

The Power of the Pen

Writing is more than a record; it's a confrontation of self. It's where vulnerability births resilience and fear is extinguished by the fire of introspection. Write daily, write candidly, and write like the fierce sissy scribe you are.

Sissy Photos & Documentation: A Visual Journey

"Working Student to Pro Pipeline, is it doable? ",Equestrian,1fanqje,2024-09-06 15:30:02,2,0.67,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/1fanqje/working_student_to_pro_pipeline_is_it_doable/,No-Elk1750,Social,"Hi,
I am 17 and I have been riding since I was about 3 years old. I started my first working student position when I was 13, and from that got my first lease. Due to finances, I have had to take many breaks, usually about a year long each, (my last one started in April 2023) but now that I am getting older and more financially responsible I am considering the possibility of just going for it. One problem, I have absolutely no show record because I could never afford to go to shows. In April, I was riding 5 days a week and schooling 3’3. I know from previous experience I will be able to get back to the meter in about 4ish months at that pace. However, I cannot ride that much while balancing school and work full time (I could work at the barn and gain time in the saddle yes, but would be making no money for the future) I talked to a few friends who are going pro, but they are all chin high in money and ribbons and nice horses. They grew up preparing for this, I didn’t. All I have ever wanted was to do this for the rest of my life, I live and breathe it. But, I want to go as high as possible. I want ultimate success. If I work hard enough, will I be able to get to the “full time trainer who operates a high end show barn in Ocala” status? My plan is to start a working student position when I graduate high school in May, but I would still be behind everyone else. Should I switch to online school in January? Should I start investing my money? I am lost! Any help appreciated. "
"Femicide in Kenya: Deaths of elite athletes cast spotlight on domestic violence

",AfricaVoice,1fa7nof,2024-09-06 01:30:38,8,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfricaVoice/comments/1fa7nof/femicide_in_kenya_deaths_of_elite_athletes_cast/,The_ghost_of_spectre,News & politics from Africa,"
[https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/25/sport/iten-killings-women-athletes-domestic-violence-kenya-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/25/sport/iten-killings-women-athletes-domestic-violence-kenya-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html)


 Agnes Tirop ran with the superstar in their junior years, when both women were scraggly teens making their mark in Kenyan competitive circles, he tells CNN. ""Watching her run and win is like watching my sister. I go through a mixture of feelings: pride, sadness ... I wish Agnes was still here, she'd be in Budapest too, competing.""
Instead, on October 13, 2021, Martin Tirop made a gruesome discovery inside his sister's three-bedroom bungalow in Kenya's capital of distance running. Agnes had just returned from a race in Switzerland, but Martin says he couldn't reach her for days.
After alerting the police, he tells CNN that he went to her house and peeked through a window to see her body slumped in a pool of blood near her bedroom door.
She had stab wounds in her neck and was wearing her Adidas sports bra and shorts. Martin believes she was probably headed out for a run when she was attacked.
In the world of elite running, Agnes had been a rising star. She broke the women's 10km record in Germany in September 2021, about a month after placing fourth in the 5,000 meters at the Tokyo Olympics. She lived and trained in Iten, where, as Martin recalls, fans would wave excitedly when she drove by in her white Toyota pickup, blaring gospel music.
Shocked neighbors gathered outside the home and wept as the 25-year-old champion was led away on a gurney.
Then six months later, nearly 2 kilometers away from her house, tragedy struck again.



Another runner, Damaris Mutua, was found strangled in a home with a pillow over her face. Mutua had just placed third at a half marathon in Angola earlier that month. She was a bronze medalist at the 2010 Singapore Youth Olympics.
Investigators declared Tirop's husband a suspect. And in Mutua's killing, the main suspect was her boyfriend.
Iten, an idyllic town perched almost 2,400 meters (about 8,000 feet) above sea level and a revered training ground for long-distance runners, was now making global headlines for the brutal killings of two women athletes, allegedly at the hands of their intimate partners.
The deaths cast a spotlight on violence that is often unnamed and unaddressed. ""We realized that female athletes are suffering, and they're silent,"" says Joan Chelimo, a long-distance runner who trains in Iten. ""They needed to know they're not alone, and they have rights, too.""
Agnes Tirop was a rising star.  Weeks before she was killed, she broke the women\&#39;s 10km record in Germany. 
Agnes Tirop was a rising star. Weeks before she was killed, she broke the women's 10km record in Germany.
A small remote town grapples with a global problem
Iten sits on the western edge of Kenya, six hours from the capital city of Nairobi. It's a scenic blend of red soil, corn fields and homes scattered across the mountainous countryside. But it's Iten's high altitude, crisp air and rural simplicity that has drawn long-distance runners to its numerous running camps since the 1960s.




Eliud Kipchoge, the first man to run a marathon in under two hours, has trained here. So has Faith Kipyegon, the current 1,500m record holder and winner of the same race at this week's World Athletics Championships. Too famous to run Iten's hills uninterrupted, both Kipchoge and Kipyegon now train at a camp in Kaptagat, about 30 miles away from Iten.
Signs of the town's greatest export are everywhere. In the hazy dawn light, before most of the town wakes up, groups of runners dash past a red metallic square arch emblazoned in white upper-case letters: ""Welcome to Iten, home of champions."" The sound of feet pounding gravel roads is punctuated only by crowing roosters and chirping birds.
The goal here, local runners tell CNN, is to get brand sponsorships, which come with stipends, performance bonuses and sometimes paid travel expenses for races -- resources that allow them to participate in international competitions. They dream of bringing home the kind of competition wins that can completely change a life in this part of the world. Prize money in the Boston Marathon, for example, is $150,000 for first place, while the New York City Marathon's top winners got $100,000 last year. By contrast, Kenya's gross national income per capita (the country's total income divided by its population) in 2022 was $2,170.
Iten draws aspiring runners and record holders alike due to its high altitude and crisp air.  Some of the biggest marathoners in Kenya have a connection to the town.

Most mornings, Agnes and her brother, in matching lime green tights and black T shirts, would lace up their sneakers and join other runners. The young woman's success had begun to transform her family's fortunes. ""Agnes had made it and was lifting our family out of poverty,"" Martin tells CNN. ""My parents had lived in a grass-thatched house all their lives until she bought them land and built them a brick house. She'd brought us so much hope.""

  



These days, Martin runs long stretches of the training route alone. He describes his anguish and rage at Agnes' killing: ""I miss running with her,"" he says. ""That man took everything from our family. Not just our sister, even our hopes and our dreams. I want him in prison forever.""
In Kenya, according to government data from 2022, more than a quarter of men, and a third of women aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical violence, ""committed by a husband/wife, intimate partner or anyone else."" Not only do more women experience violence, as the survey points out, ""marital status is linked to experiences of violence among women ... women who have ever been married are much more likely to have experienced violence since age 15 than those who have never been married (41% versus 20%).""




While the official data shows prevalence of intimate partner violence, experts tell CNN that the true number of cases is probably higher than reported as many victims suffer in silence. ""A majority of the attacks don't get reported because people don't have faith in the system,"" says Irungu Houghton, executive director for Amnesty International Kenya. ""They feel that the police may not be humane, that they may ridicule them, that the judicial process may take too long.""




Domestic violence is not limited to Kenya alone. A review of all the available data from 2000 to 2018, which covers 90% of women and girls ages 15 and over in 161 countries and areas, found that 27% of partnered women have experienced intimate partner violence.
In the United States, ""1 in 4 women have experienced severe intimate partner violence,"" according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Advocacy groups have described the murder of US women, ""predominantly killed by men they know, and largely by current or former intimate partners,"" as ""a silent epidemic.""
The deaths of Tirop and Mutua are proof that even successful female athletes cannot escape violence.

'We don't protect them. We just expect them to break records'
Experts and runners alike tell CNN that in Iten, a mix of (potential) wealth, fame and a patriarchal culture -- where a man is expected to be the breadwinner -- leaves young ambitious women either prey to unscrupulous men trying to get their hands on their future earnings, or vulnerable to intimate partners who wish to control them.
At a gathering of athletes in Iten, half a dozen women shared stories with CNN of alleged physical, emotional or financial abuse at the hands of an intimate partner. One woman said she had to hand over all her prize money to her husband so he could maintain his image as the family breadwinner.


Reflecting on the precarious position that some female runners find themselves in, Njeri Migwi, founder of Usikimye, an organization that provides refuge to victims of sexual and gender-based violence across Kenya, tells CNN: ""The minute they want certain levels of independence, the men abuse them. We \[society\] don't protect them ... we don't even give them training \[to advocate for themselves\] ... we just expect them to run and break records. Where is the outrage? Where is the anger?""
Echoing Migwi's words, runner Joan Chelimo tells CNN that young up-and-coming runners ""are easy targets because they are new, they don't know much, they have no financial advisers. Some of them are being given something as simple as shoes or being offered connections to agents, and then they feel responsible to give everything to this man, to be submissive to the man.""


These views are certainly supported by Martin Tirop's account of his sister's life.
In October 2021, Martin Tirop found the body of his sister, Agnes Tirop.
Agnes, he says, had begun dating her husband, Ibrahim Rotich, when she was still in high school. He was 16 years older, and Martin says he isolated Agnes from her friends and family. In fact, their March 2016 marriage had been a secret, with Agnes' family only finding out after her death at 25.


Martin alleges that Rotich had been abusive, and Agnes had left him, moving to a training camp for runners shortly before she was killed. He says they later found out from a friend that Agnes had briefly returned to the home she once shared with her husband.
A day after Agnes' body was found, Rotich was arrested 800km away in the coastal city of Mombasa. He was allegedly trying to flee the country, the Kenyan Directorate of Criminal Investigations said at the time.
Rotich pleaded not guilty to murder, although he admitted to killing Tirop in an affidavit requesting bail, according to court documents and Tirop's family attorney, Richard Warigi. His request for a plea deal on a lesser charge of manslaughter was denied, the lawyer adds.
Ibrahim Rotich is being held without bail on a murder charge and his trial begins in November. His attorney, Ngigi Mbugua, declined to comment.



Mutua, who held both Kenyan and Bahraini nationality, was 28 when she was killed. The man suspected of the crime, her Ethiopian boyfriend, has not been arrested. Investigators told local media last year that he left for neighboring Ethiopia after the killing.
CNN reached out to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations for more information but has not heard back. Equally, CNN's attempts to reach Mutua's family were also unsuccessful.


Investigators have not disclosed the alleged motives behind the killings of each woman. But Houghton of Amnesty International is categorical about what he sees as the root cause of domestic violence in Kenya, more broadly: ""The major driver of sexual and gender-based violence is patriarchy,"" he tells CNN.


""The idea is that men have an entitlement to women's bodies, that they should always be in control, that they should have more resources and finances and income. And of course, \[this\] is not the reality in the real world anymore."" 'Don't be quiet when anyone harms you'
On a sunny Saturday in late June, three dozen women meet in the courtyard of their fellow athlete, Joan Chelimo's guesthouse. They dance, hug, huddle in groups and eat plates of rice and chicken. Some share their experiences of abuse and how they quietly planned their exits while their spouses were away.


The event is organized by Tirop's Angels, a nonprofit group started in early 2022 by athletes and Agnes Tirop's family, which states among its objectives: Empowering women and girls at risk of violence, expanding services available to survivors, intensifying efforts to turn policy pledges into reality and engaging men and boys, traditional and faith leaders in prevention efforts.
Chelimo is one of the group's five co-founders. ""We started Tirop's Angels out of emotions, we were heartbroken,"" she says. ""Agnes lived here \[in Iten\], she was one of us, and we didn't even know what she was going through.""
But the first reaction to this new group, hoping to start a public conversation about what has been happening privately, was suspicion and distrust.




""It was very hard for people to understand what we were doing,"" Chelimo admits. ""Most of the men thought that we are against marriage. And here, most things are cultural: if I go to my mother or to my girlfriends, they'll tell me to fight for my marriage even if it's abusive. Trying to change that mindset is not easy.""
""Now, girls are coming to us and speaking up,"" Chelimo adds. ""That's a big achievement because, like Agnes, a lot of them could not talk about their issues.""




The organization brings in experts to help young runners live more rounded lives, providing them with information on subjects from financial literacy to investments and relationship red flags. ""We want to make sure the women are financially independent so that in case someone wants to leave, they don't feel like they are holding on to their partners due to what they have,"" Chelimo tells CNN. ""It's hard work ... because we're dealing with so many issues here that are interconnected.""


The group realizes that a major cultural shift is needed and says it's working with local schools to educate children on forms of abuse, to ensure future generations of runners learn crucial lessons at a young age.

Agnes' parents, Dinah and Vincent Tirop, visit their daughter's grave in the back of the family home in Nandi County.
The loss of her daughter has also made an advocate out of Dinah Tirop. ""Every chance I get, I tell young girls, even my other daughters, 'Be careful who you date. Don't let anyone lie to you, don't be quiet when anyone harms you,'"" she says in a whisper.


Agnes' trophies, medals and ribbons are neatly arranged on a table in the corner of her parents' living room, a monument to a daughter whose big dreams came true. Dinah takes the Tokyo Olympic ribbon from the table, places it around her neck and gently runs her hand over it. Her eyes well up. Not knowing what her daughter was going through still haunts her to this day.
A grave is visible through the open door, its dark granite glistening after a heavy downpour.


""Agnes Tirop. Loved beyond words,"" the cross reads.
At the home of Agnes Tirop\&#39;s parents, a small table in the corner of the living room displays some of her medals, a tribute to a daughter whose big dreams came true.

Crypto Industry Expands with RWAs ,u_RefrigeratorIll4031,1euv6ob,2024-08-17 19:29:55,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RefrigeratorIll4031/comments/1euv6ob/crypto_industry_expands_with_rwas/,RefrigeratorIll4031,,"Hello everyone. I would like to tell you a little about RWAs (Real World Assets), which play an important role in the cryptocurrency market today. 

Real World Assets (RWA) are tangible assets that lie outside the digital domain and can be tokenized and incorporated into the blockchain ecosystem. RWA includes tangible and physical assets (Real estate, land, machinery equipment) as well as financial contracts (business loans, mortgages, bonds). u/DAOLabs

The best part about the RWA space is that it covers a wide range of industries, markets and use cases, from fine art to real estate and intellectual property. u/SocialMining



Real estate is the big market within the broader RWA industry. Because RWA projects break up the ownership structure. It enables everyone to own real estate.



 There are not only residences, but also commercial enterprises such as hotels, warehouses and shopping malls. RWA projects not only make real estate affordable; It also creates a secondary market. This means token holders can buy and sell their RWA real estate investments at any time. Considering that real estate is an illiquid asset, RWA solves a major problem for investors.



So what benefits will tokenizing these real-world assets bring us? Tokenization of RWAs aims to increase liquidity, transparency, and accessibility, although it introduces regulatory considerations and security issues.

Thanks to RWAs, users can access various financial markets through blockchain applications. RWAs often find their place in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem by increasing the usability of financial instruments and opening new application areas.

Tokenization of RWAs could impact global economies by enabling further expansion of the crypto sector.



Some of the best RWA crypto tokens on the market today:

1:99Bitcoin Token (99BTC) 

2:Chain connection (LINK)

3: Producer (MKR)

4:Ondo Finance (ONDO)

5:Strip Financing (RBN)



I think RWAs, which tokenize assets from the physical world to the blockchain protocol, will be key in the future

BUY BUY BUY!,"Apparently, Japan has this big ""medal"" culture - I'll explain. Throughout the Soka Gakkai's history, it issued numerous medals and jewelry-type accessories, which the Gakkai members wore with pride. Things like medals issued to acknowledge their participation in regular monetary contributions, publications support acknowledgment, study level achievements, I don't know, and as you'll see, more casual accessories like tie bars for a man to clip onto his tie.

Here, take a look:

[Finance Department pin](https://i.imgur.com/2M3NHMd.png) - the pin is silver; the rim is 18K gold plated. This would have been awarded to a regular financial contributor. This pin was [featured on ""Twin Peaks""](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/d8g3j9/fyi_folks_at_the_replica_prop_forum_have/), apparently - the OP includes an image of the OP's own pin (slightly different - looks older). [Here is another](https://imgur.com/377SCLh), apparently well-worn; its box says ""Finance department badge/Soka Gakkai"". [Here](https://i.imgur.com/hXcyKbF.png) is a lot of vintage medallions and pins; you can see three of these lower-middle, along with two others I haven't yet seen on their own (so I don't have any idea what those are for). 

[""Local honor badge""](https://i.imgur.com/Ewwmkdq.png)

[Seikyo Culture Prize](https://i.imgur.com/yHJ8KFZ.png) (1980s) - this medallion is on a [fancy ribbon](https://i.imgur.com/xanWKpu.png), suggesting it was ceremoniously placed around someone's neck onstage during some major gathering, similar to the US's [Medal of Honor](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Sep/05/2003294660/825/780/0/230905-A-AR102-1006.JPG). On the other side there is [an image of the Seikyo Shimbun building](https://i.imgur.com/7jO53SN.png) (Soka Gakkai's newspaper) and the inscription states ""Seikyo Shinbunsha and Honorary Company owner Ikeda Daisaku"". Really?? Why is Ikeda the *owner??* 

[""Instructor"" pin](https://i.imgur.com/LpIpn1X.png) - 18K gold plated. I'm not sure if it's pre- or post-excommunication, but you can see [here](https://imgur.com/YOrPLFE) a *different* lot that includes TWO of these and describes them as ""Leader's badge"". You can see the pre-excommunication crane image ""Finance Department badge"" pin to the lower right in the group shot and third from left in the thumbnails.

[Another pin](https://i.imgur.com/uO8tUVO.png) - I'm not sure what this one was awarded for, but it's 18K gold plated and the central character translates ""treasure"". I'd guess something donation-related.

[Tie bar 1](https://i.imgur.com/7CeldhP.png) - the symbol in the middle is similar to the symbols for the [2nd World Peace Culture Festival](https://i.imgur.com/V8oshnI.png) and the [3rd World Peace Culture Festival](https://i.imgur.com/EhrwyKW.png), and the [text](https://i.imgur.com/okI3j2j.png) says ""The 4th World Peace Cultural Festival"". I'm not sure when this ""4th World Peace Culture Festival"" was, but the 2nd World Peace Culture Festival was [in 1982](https://i.imgur.com/V8oshnI.png) and the 3rd World Peace Culture Festival was [in 1983](https://i.imgur.com/e9flpdd.png) so draw your own conclusions.

As you can see, these are post-excommunication:

[A lot of several pins](https://imgur.com/YOrPLFE) - the blue/gold ones are apparently ""Leader's badges"", and I'm guessing the two in the upper left of the group shot are the ""Soyukai badge, Regional division"" and the ""Central executive badge"". If you *had* these, you'd be *wearing* these.

[Some kind of honor badge](https://i.imgur.com/DWREivf.png) - the atomic symbol indicates it is post-excommunication; before then, the Soka Gakkai used the [tsurumaru](https://www.amazon.ca/Nichiren-Tsurumaru-Included-Fragrance-Buddhist/dp/B0CQH4MR4L) of Nichiren Shoshu as its emblem.

[Tie bar 2](https://i.imgur.com/UIxnXyB.png) - ""Kosen-rufu merit award""

[Tie bar 3](https://i.imgur.com/KSfYyGR.png) (far right) - the ""[Kosen-rufu award emblem](https://i.imgur.com/pBo93lN.png)""

These were obviously designed to be worn, the pins and tie bars, at least.

Imagine you are a Soka Gakkai member, and over the years, you've collected many of these symbols of awards and honors. You used to wear them with pride; they functioned as a status enhancer within your Soka Gakkai community. But what are they now? You can't wear them any more; they don't count for *anything* any more! Not the ones with the Nichiren Shoshu crane on them, at least.

How will that make you feel about your organization? Do you think animosity and vitriol toward the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood can 100% deflect the loss in value? Or would you lay some of the blame on the Soka Gakkai itself for not valuing its own history and those who participated in it and distinguished themselves there, especially as these noteworthies aged and no longer had the same opportunities or ability to collect such awards?

In the wake of the Olympics, imagine if there were a ruling of some kind that invalidated *all* previous medals and records. How would you feel if you'd been a competitor, worked so hard for so many years, qualified for the team, won gold or even bronze, and all of a sudden saw your achievements wiped away, invalidated by someone who wasn't even involved? Or, worse, by the same person/organization responsible for making the awards in the first place!"

Character popularity in gacha is often baffling--there are times where we would assume one character to absolutely explode with fanart based on the many positive qualities they have, only for them to trend well for a short period of time (or not at all), while I'm sure most of us have been blindsided by a fair share of dark horses. To add to the confusion, there are cases where a character may start off modestly, only to explode in popularity after receiving an alt or design. Such is the case of our darling, Asuna Ichinose and the subject for today's essay.

# Humble Beginnings

https://preview.redd.it/ysd9jtt0qxhd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6adecdfdc1ed1a04ff8f035070a9a055c7a1249

Do you guys feel like having your mind blown? As of me typing this, Asuna has just under 20k submitted works on Pixiv, making her the 2nd most popular in terms of art behind Yuuka, who very recently broke past 20k. To share just how grand that is, Mash Kyrielight, the main heroine of FGO, sits at just under 38k works after 9 years of her respective game being released, while Raiden Shogun clocks in almost 23k as an expy of a series of characters from Hoyo's older titles (particularly Honkai Impact). These heroines aren't from some random series, mind you, as Mash hails from Fate, one of the legacy series when it comes to VNs and anime, and Raiden Shogun from the massive Hoyo brand. The fact that 2 characters from a less popular title can generate so much art is remarkable--but what if I told you that wasn't the surprising thing mentioned just a second ago?

Despite Asuna's current popularity, she has come from some very humble beginnings. All things considered, Asuna is almost the antithesis of Yuuka, in the sense that Yuuka was almost perfectly setup to be popular, while Asuna wasn't even fortunate enough to launch with the L2D for her vanilla form. Before a certain day, Asuna would still collect a share of fanart--just not as much as your Arus and Hinas.

[@kuriyukian3](https://preview.redd.it/z8rb6cvfyxhd1.jpg?width=430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81958e02c2fd32c9a08c046e624edbf6bd5ed172)

As expected of early works for just about any character, things start out pretty simple, as artists have yet to learn the personalities and traits of the characters they draw. In the case of Asuna, many of her early artworks focus on, her, err...well, *breasts.* I don't expect to hear many gasps upon making such a statement, but while Asuna definitely has a lot of works today that have that kind of focus, I want to go ahead and address the elephant in the room before moving on with this essay.

It's no secret that Asuna's leans more to the fanservice-y side of things than characters like Yuuka, Aru, and Hina, I want to make it clear that this analysis won't amount to 'large breasts = popularity', as that would be rather disrespectful to Asuna's character (and possibly fans?), while also not being 100% accurate of a statement, given the fact that Asuna represents an anomaly in a sea of well-endowed characters. If breasts were the only factor here, afterall, Asuna would probably not have enough fanart to almost eclipse the entirety of NIKKE's section.

# B-Day

https://preview.redd.it/od88y0hi1yhd1.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cc38c3bee82342a145095d06ac3bba6e615eed0

By 'B-Day' I mean 'Bunny Day', not 'Birthday'...although to some Blue Archive/Asuna fans, the release of this event could be considered like a birthday. In any case, the Bunny Chaser event marked a major point in history for Blue Archive. Imagine or recall being a Blue Archive player going on Twitter or Pixiv to do your daily browsing of the series's tag (that's just not me, right...*right?)* only to find rows of Asuna art. ""Huh..."" you may think as those rows turn into pages of Asuna with what seems like small specks of other students mixed in like chocolate chips in the dough that is Bunny Asuna.

There's quite to unpack here, so to start: bunny girls (as in the casino ones) have a very long history dating back to the late 1950's as a design by the mother of Ilse Taurins, a Latvian man who was in a relationship with Victor Lownes the 3rd, the co-founder of a club dedicated to Playboy magazine. The designs were...rough at first, up until Hugh Hefner, the founder of the company, collaborated with his associates to redesign the suits, eventually ending up with the design most of us are familiar with now. These would then be fitted on playmates who would work as cocktail waitresses for the bars/clubs associated with the brand.

https://preview.redd.it/ih0x082l5yhd1.png?width=268&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ea177fe2381602ab34386c63e69bdaab8198cca

Over time, these bunny outfits would branch away from the Playboy brand and gain international popularity in Japan, which would, as expected, make its way to anime. Needless to say, the outfits are very popular among weebs, to the point where you'll find them in many non-Hoyo gacha games.

Bringing us back from the Playboy mansion to Kivotos, this event would be where Asuna's popularity would explode in such a way that is an extreme rarity. So, *what happened.* While Yuuka's popularity can be attributed to frequent exposure in-game and through official promotion, *Asuna is more of a product of the inner-workings of trends*. 

One of the most important things an artist needs to do while posting their work includes tagging them in a way that'll get the most exposure from viewers who would be more likely to follow their works. If, say, you're an artist dedicated to Shiroko, the most obvious tag you'd want to use (aside from Shiroko's name) is 'Blue Archive', as the odds of the people searching this tag being into your works is really high. From there, you may want to use tags as 'Wolf Girl', 'Heterochromia', any aspect of Shiroko or your art that is easy to find. 

Why this is so important is due to the fact that artists can benefit from non-Blue Archive players--while one individual may not care for or know what a 'Blue Archive' is, they may be interested in seeing funny wolf girls and consume that Shiroko art all the same.

From the moment Asuna first surged in popularity was the moment she also gained broad appeal. Someone who would be browsing large breasts, bunny outfits, etc. would be exposed to Asuna; as they are exposed to Asuna, they may like and retweet works involving Asuna; as Asuna art gets more exposure, more gets requested and drawn, creating a sort of feedback loop that leads to where we are today.

It goes without saying that being associated with popular tags serves to benefit characters. As an example, let's examine how much some of Asuna's common tags trend:

|Tag|Total # of Works|# of Works With Asuna|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bunny Girl (バニーガール)|171,772|8,358|
|Large Breasts (巨乳)|1,079,300--Jesus christ, guys|4,180|
|Uniform (制服)|334,999|1,108|

Now there's more to interpret here than raw numbers. Timing is as much as a factor here than the amount of total works a specific tag has. This is especially true for colossal tags like 'large breasts', as those numbers come from being both popular and really old, having existed since Pixiv became a platform. Just imagine being a person who frequents that tag daily: while you may have damn near one million images liked from years of adventuring, you still frequent the 'new' filter so you may continue to add to your collection. Suddenly, you see said tag being flooded with Asuna and decided that you like the lovely lady enough to then keep track of her tag. As you like Asuna's works, your fellow enjoyers of large landmasses will also take notice and follow your example.

A tag doesn't have to be a million strong, **so long as a character has a large enough presence to get the attention of viewers.**  If, for example, you were to search 'one eye covered' (片目隠れ), you'll receive a trail mix of Shenhe (Genshin), Mash (FGO), our very own Iori, and, of course, Asuna. The tag, itself, is just under 17k strong, **but because works are added slower than 'large breasts' and 'Bunny Girl', viewers are more likely to dive deep enough through the section to catch many glimpses of Asuna.** To elaborate, the large breast tag is absurdly huge, yet we only have so much time in our day to browse through it. Unless you specifically add a character to your search, there's a good chance you'll miss them as a huge tag gets more and more saturated with art. With smaller tags, however, they're a lot easier to, not only browse through, but keep track of, increasing the odds of being exposed to specific characters.

>[iironpig (Pixiv)](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/121208148) (2)

Aside from giving the world more Asuna, the Bunny Chaser event gave more Asuna in general, as she got a bit more story, interactions, and details to play around with. In the above, for eample, the artist makes a reference to Bunny Asuna's EX skill that shows Asuna using her fluffy tail as a grenade. 

[@JoJe6hi](https://preview.redd.it/h5uwiu7chyhd1.jpg?width=361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa1580b045ae27dcd98b2e660b6ac347fc958aad)

>[JoJe6hi (Pixiv)](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/120997284) (3)

Similarly, this work illustrates Asuna washing clothes in the laundromat, as shown in her bunny alt's L2D scene. Other than that, Asuna's works gradually began to include her fellow clubmates, most notably Karin, to which Asuna currently shares 2.3k works with.

Combining Asuna's tag with 'Bunny Girl', we can estimate that Bunny Asuna makes up over 8.3k of Asuna's total works, showing just how astronomical the bunny event was for Asuna. With that being said, there's one last aspect to Asuna's popularity that I believe is worth bringing up.

# My Dress-Up Darling

To close things off, I want to mention the fact that, long after the Bunny Chaser event's premiere, Asuna maintains an extreme amount of popularity today. Not only that, but most of her works *actually aren't of her bunny alt*, rather, include Asuna in her base form, but also a variety of outfits both in-game (as the Millenium cheer uniform), from promotional material, and ones crafted by fans.

[@aLFie](https://preview.redd.it/cu7rjzi6lyhd1.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8101242823031d2bbf32b3c679ac40c01488294d)

>[aLFie (Pixiv)](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/116351692) (4)

Just like how someone like Karin is often depicted as a cool beauty in many of her fanarts, more fanarts began focusing on Asuna's overall personality/expression, indicating that fans are drawn to Asuna's sunny disposition. The above just about sums this up well, comparing Asuna to that of a Labrador Retriever, a breed of dogs who are popularly associated with playfulness and a warm/kind demeanor. She's fun to dress-up and has a bit of an aura that artists and viewers can certainly vibe with.

With just over 6k works marked as R-18, there's no denying that Asuna's 'sexy factor' has a hand in her popularity, but as mentioned earlier, it wouldn't be fair or accurate to reduce Asuna as a character for coomers, especially when her popularity is so astronomically high. Even in-game, Asuna isn't depicted as being degenerate as Nodoka, Kotama, or Hanako as much as she is energetic and playful.

To wrap everything up, Yuuka and Asuna represent anomalies, not just in Blue Archive, but in anime/gacha in general. While Yuuka's circumstances lined up perfectly to make her a fan favorite, Asuna, at the start, just needed a small push forward with her bunny alt to get the amount of exposure she has and continues to receive today.

# In Conclusion

Going back to our original question, we can now understand this trend in popularity as being the result of several/combinations of factors as:

* **Support from devs**, as was the case with Yuuka being the tutorial l2D that everyone gets first, as well as a steady amount of appearances in Blue Archive and related works.
* **The ability to trend in and outside of the playerbase**. With someone like Yuuka, who has received a large amount of in-game appearances, we noticed how many of her works referenced official events, including the famous '100 kg' meme. Asuna, likewise, gained a very broad reach after the Bunny Chaser event thanks to her ability to appeal to even non-Blue Archive players.
* **Pairing well with other popular tags**, as seen with Asuna being a schoolgirl, maid, and bunny.

Optimistically speaking, both Asuna and Yuuka have shown that, even with a slow start, characters can very well make a comeback. So, hey, maybe one day we'll wakeup to an ocean of Shimiko art once she gets her swimsuit.

Next up will be a more narrative approach to things, as we examine how official and fan perceptions of characters affect how they are depicted in doujins and fan-comics, with our star students for this analysis will be Mari, Kazusa, Kikyou, and Wakamo.

Why RWAs Real world asset tokenization is a game changer and to be extremely bullish on long term Ethereum,ethtrader,1enyo2u,2024-08-09 08:40:40,25,0.97,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1enyo2u/why_rwas_real_world_asset_tokenization_is_a_game/,yester_philippines,Sentiment,"RWA “Real-world asset tokenization” is the process of bringing these assets on-chain as security tokens to take advantage of blockchain technology 

Tokenization of real-world assets refers to the process of converting real-world or traditional assets and representing ownership such as:

 • equities (represent ownership stakes in private companies & funds)

 • Debt instruments: (bonds, mortgages)

 • Real estate: (residential, commercial buildings) 

 • Commodities (gold, silver, oil)

 • Art & collectibles 

 • Intellectual property: (patents, trademarks, copyrights)

 • Carbon credits: (tracking carbon credits & renewable energy certificates) 

Advantages: reduced costs, improved liquidity & faster settlements

Now what does RWA have to do with ETH? 

Recently we all know institutions like BlackRock started their tokenization BUIDL on the Ethereum mainnet, which will more institutions / organizations / companies to join 

Some of the Ethereum Based RWA tokens: 

 • Chainlink

 • Maker

 • ONDO

 • Pendle

 • Synthetix Network SNX

 • Ribbon Finance RBN 

The main reason here is that traditional stock market as we all know operates only on weekdays and off on weekends, with the RWA’s trading (buying, selling) will be 24/7 

Note: the big institutions were and still not a big fan of crypto but they can see the real uses of blockchain and how they can be even richer, but time will change their mindset 

Now you can imagine the inflows to start flowing into Ethereum and why you should be extremely bullish on ETH for the long term"

Am I going crazy???,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1e2iyok,2024-07-13 15:43:48,2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1e2iyok/am_i_going_crazy/,Novel_Put_2039,,"This is hard because I never speak about my marriage outside my marriage! Most people don't give advise that helps the marriage and also when you are just giving one side and pointing out what this other person has said or done, it changes your friend or family members vision of them . For the record ,  My husband is and amazing father , very involved. Very loving an affectionate husband. I'm married 41 ( f ) , together for 10 yrs,  we have 3 beautiful children. Recently, my husband's normal behavior, is now , not so normal. For background, my husband and I have not always lived a financially blessed lifestyle. Now during our hard times he made sure we needed for nothing. He worked 12 hr day then did odd jobs after work and on wknds. I of course worked too but he took his job as provider and protector seriously, still does . After the passing of a very dear family member, my husband inherited the family business and pretty much everything from this family member. Our lives have drastically changed!! We both decided since it's been my dream to be a stay at home mom now I can. No more missed activities, having other people raise my kids. I have never been happier !! We hold a very traditional household my husband runs the business and handles all finances , I stay home and care for our children and home. I love our set up and it is what work for us!! We have a very healthy sex life and very happy ( definitely on my end ) He has always kept the business separate from the family. I dont mind. This business was built for the benefit of generational family and it's from his famiky . A lot of the business events he has to attend are morning meetings, chamber meetings, ribbon cuttings, meetings for different boards he sits on , and on the occasion business after hrs ( most stop on their way home from work ) so more business than personal , that is why I have not or been invited to attend , it does not bother me! This is where I do not know if I'm being paranoid , over thinking, just plain crazy, or worse right . My husband was invited to a black tie affair  , in the evening , on a weekend  . My husband is telling me about the event, who's going to be there, the amazing caterer they got, basically how grand this event was going to be . He's excited to wear this new suit. At the end of it, no hesitation , he says he's going to ask his friend George ( that's what we will call him ) to accompany him. I don't know how I kept it together but I said that sounded amazing and hoped he had a great time. My mind immediately went to , he's embarrassed of me. Why would an event like this,  would your first thought , to bring someone other than your wife. I rarely get to do anything fun like this ! Yes I get to get dressed for date night but a night on the town, formal gowns , amazing food and drinks. Who else would your husband possibly invite? I come from a good family, educated, I'm no Heidi Klum but I'm attractive. I would be a fun date, look amazing on his arm , most would think to bring their wife even if it wasn't traditional to do so , WTF ?? My wheels start turning! I even  look through the past yrs pictures to see who people brought as their "" plus one "" and it's all spouses !!  Any lunches we "" try "" a new place never in town. they only people I have met in his circle are people like George, randomly , outing encounters or if we hired them and then I'm introduced . Never thought it was out of character. Now I wonder ,did I miss every FUCKING flag , what am I FUCKING missing! Is he embarrassed of me , could it be cheating, is he just thoughtless in this dept , WTF Now personally I don't think it gone there ( cheating in the physical sense ) if he has encountered someone.  He's home every night, a lot of times early, he's here all wknd, we do have a very healthy sex life , I'm spoiled with jewelry, purses, anything I want I get . We communicate and have good conversations. We do date night at least twice a month , random wknd trips, so no usual factors to raise alarm . Oddly a month ago, we went on an amazing vacation . After I posted our pictures. Every single picture of me and my husband was reported!! get this "" inappropriate material "" , wtf ??!! yes we were on a island but there was not one of me even in a bathing suit, no inappropriate poses, outfits, nothing !! Took a week to dispute it. Could it be he is seeing someone and they got mad and they tried removing them . Is he embarrassed of me? Could he have met someone he enjoys talking to them and flirting . with and me being there will ruin it, is he that good at cheating?? I really just need to talk it out . I'm not tech savvy so please do not use my name if repeating, my luck I'm sure it post ! Thank you "
A Summary of President Rexford G.

**Administration:**

Vice President: Frank G. Clement

Secretary of State: Francois Duvalier

Secretary of the Treasury: Leon Keyserling

Secretary of Planning: Teodoro Moscoso (1958-1961)

Attorney General: Jerome Frank (1957 (died)), Benjamin V. Cohen (1957-1961)

Secretary of the Military: Raymond A. Spruance

Secretary of the Interior: Mary Keyserling

Secretary of Agriculture: Orville Freeman

Secretary of Labor: Walter Reuther

Secretary of Science and Technology: Linus Pauling

Secretary of Elections: Joseph Borkin (1957-1961)

Secretary of Health: Paul Dudley White

Postmaster General: Lindy Boggs

Secretary of Energy: Chester F. Carlson

Secretary of Education: Alice Acheson

Secretary of Culture: Helen Gahagan Douglas (1957-1959 (resigned)), Bette Davis (1959-1961)

President Tugwell would kick off his term with [a landmark inaugural address, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dxmfzm/a_new_dawn_for_a_new_america_peacockshah/)harkening to the Founders as he vowed to build the nation anew and continue their experiment “*adapted for the 20th century.*” Of his [proposal for](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dxlquh/a_modest_proposal_pt2_psae/)[ a new constitution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dxlnc5/a_modest_proposal_pt1_psae/), Tugwell would declare “*I propose reforms that empower the executive with the responsibility to appoint half the legislature and the entire judiciary, alongside specialized branches for economic planning, regulatory oversight, and electoral supervision. These changes are not about consolidating power but about ensuring that our government can act decisively and responsibly on behalf of all Americans.*” Later in his term, Tugwell would summarize his beliefs by arguing that “*society can no longer be run efficiently or justly on the principles of individualism and competition,*” and that his desire was not socialism, but to “*save the profit system and private ownership of property by adapting them to the modern age, to coordinate and control private enterprise to eliminate the anarchy of the competitive system*.”

While presiding over a personal clique of friends and academics nicknamed his “Brain Trust,” the cabinet of the Tugwell Administration would be notably steady, barring only the resignation of Helen Gahagan Douglas, a friend of Tugwell’s despite her distaste for his fascism embodied in her protest of a Department of Culture pamphlet entitled *Labor and Capital under Fascism*, from the newly created Department of Culture in 1959 after revelations of an affair between her and Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, distributed by the Hearst media empire. Tugwell would publicly defend his friend Douglas until her decision to depart from the Administration, after which she would be replaced by actress and campaign donor Bette Davis. However, many Farmer-Laborites would be dismayed by a rumor that Tugwell had considered appointing retired Marine Corps General David Shoup, among the three generals of the Triumvirate that seized power from Michael A. Musmanno to rule the nation during the lame duck period between the Christmas Crisis and the inauguration of President Quesada, as Secretary of the Military. Although held back by the reaction from party leadership, Tugwell has appointed pro-Triumvirate General Omar Bradley as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

[Postcard honoring the expansion of APTO to Australia, Westralia, and New Zealand.](https://preview.redd.it/eumu7zansbcd1.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c23d2f83e8c062155f05a4dd03d9e46b2293002)

**Foreign Policy:**

-The Tugwell Administration has recanted on the idea of an anti-communist “Iron Curtain” in the Pacific. Although maintaining support for APTO, Tugwell has ceased all nuclear tests and began trilateral negotiations on the status of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands with the RSFSR and Japan, now led by Socialist Prime Minister Jōtarō Kawakami. Similar socialist and social democratic governments have sprung up across APTO, excepting only China, where the iron figure of Yan Xishan dominated the nation until his death in January of 1960.

-Despite protests from across the political spectrum, Tugwell has worked through the Department of the Military to end the manufacture of all nuclear weapons, declaring that “*by Christian standards, nothing so challengingly wicked has ever appeared to test man's capacity for discerning what’s right*.” As Tugwell brings the United States away from a nuclear policy, the British Empire, RSFSR, and France have begun to assemble their own nuclear arsenals, and whispers of such a desire emanate from the Caliphate, China, and even Canada.

-With Yan’s death, his son-in-law Wang Jingguo would take power and win a snap election against moderate opposition led by Zhang Xueliang, noted for his role in the resistance to Japan. However, Zhao Ziyang of the Chinese Communist Party has accused the election of being rigged and has begun a call for armed resistance. With thousands engaged, unrest has engulfed rural China.

-Tugwell would denounce “*reactionaries*” of wishing to foment “*a cold war with Russia,*” and instead argue that the United States must pursue a more cordial relationship with the world’s communist nations. Harkening to America’s own failed revolution, Tugwell would make a never before heard statement from a President, praising the courage of revolutionaries and hosting veterans from both sides of the conflict at the White House for a “*moment of reconciliation*.” Chief among his critics would be Benjamin Gitlow, now a Senator from New York, who would accuse Tugwell of attempting to dress up his own movement for authoritarianism.

-Peruvian Communist leader Jorge del Prado Chavez would meet with Tugwell twice over his term, with the two deporting extensive discussion of Sorelian thought and the relationship of the United States to Latin America and a proposed [North American Union](http://ww.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dszhxn/a_proposal_for_a_north_american_union_psae/). With former Vice President Will Rogers Jr. having been forced from the Quesada Administration for his friendliness to the Bolsheviks, Tugwell would make a bipartisan gesture by first introducing him to President Chavez and then appointing him as Ambassador to the RSFSR.

-In February of 1958, former President Philip La Follette, with his attorney Robert F. Kennedy, would embark upon the most important effort of his post-presidency and international tours: a campaign against South African apartheid. With white minority rule raising its head in the Congo, La Follette would denounce “*gross violations of civil liberties*” and praise African National Congress leader Albert Luthuli. American Farmer-Laborites noting South Africa’s role as the first nation to have recognized Quesada as President, would cheer as La Follette declared that “*each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope; and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance*.”

-The unprecedented declaration sparked a new wave of activity from the ANC, as well as increasing global support, as the notably anti-apartheid Harold Nicolson was[ elected leader of the British Labour Party in 1958](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dyl59n/1958_labour_party_leadership_election_peacockshah/?share_id=JYsOVE6BlGJhfgGJiD0Gn&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1), following the death of Oliver Baldwin and [the success of the notably racialist Enoch Powell in the Tory leadership election](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dyl808/1958_conservative_party_leadership_selection/). With violence and international pressure mounting, as well as the rise of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party among White South Africans, the South African government moved ever closer to Charles De Gaulle’s France in an attempt to secure their tyranny before the dramatic fall of apartheid in 1960, with democratic elections scheduled.

-De Gaulle would nonetheless look to La Follette’s moderate policies toward France in refusing to protest his election as Chairman of the Parliament of Nations in early 1960, pushed by Tugwell. La Follette has quickly become a thorn in France’s side, however, denouncing the conditions in the Congo among both Germans and Flemish ethnically cleansed and forcefully deported to the colony and the growing independence movement among Black Africans, referring to the Congo as “*ready to explode*.” President Tugwell, for his part, has continued seeking to win the support of newly independent African nations such as Ghana or Botswana, declaring that ""*we abjure colonialism not in words but by deed*.""

-Westralian Prime Minister Keith Watson, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies, and New Zealand Prime Minister John A. Lee would sign onto APTO in 1959 at the alliance’s annual summit in Bangkok. A Westralian mission would be deployed in 1957 at Tugwell’s behest to search for Antarctic explorer Richard E. Byrd, twice a presidential candidate and leader of the Hollow Earth movement, who would be declared missing after his final expedition. Some former followers of Byrd’s have claimed that he, as they claim Ignatius Donnelly once did, has joined the peoples residing within the hollow Earth. Others allege an Atlantean conspiracy, noting America’s 5 presidents with Irish ancestry, centered on Donnelly’s claim that the people of Atlantis became the Irish after the lost continent’s destruction.

-Even as Amero-Canadian relations remain tense, Tugwell and Milton Fowler Gregg, Prime Minister of New Brunswick, would host a meeting of the leaders of the Atlantic states in 1957. Notably, however, he would refuse to invite Quebec Governor Maurice Duplessis, infuriating Duplessis and contributing to a feud that would last until the death of the architect of Quebec annexation in 1959. However, Prime Minister [Diefenbaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dxsuhe/1956_progressive_conservative_convention/) of Canada itself, re-elected in a 1957 landslide, has not met with Tugwell, even as Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas did so in 1959, calling for national friendship in North America.

**Domestic Policy:**

-Repeatedly calling for state legislatures to authorize a constitutional convention with the goal of enshrining his proposed Newstates constitution, Tugwell would achieve several of his “immediate demands” in the first months of his presidency: working with Speaker Gerald Ford, Tugwell would begin an audit of federal agencies to cut costs while working across the aisle to pass the [Americans With Disabilities Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dx4krq/voice_for_the_voiceless_peacockshah_alternate/), the brainchild of Nebraska’s Bob Dole, and craft a series of welfare reform proposals, spearheaded by S.I. Hayakawa, which has dramatically reduced welfare spending. Working with the party left, Tugwell would pass the Zioncheck Act of 1957, raising the tax on the top bracket anew to a record 91%, raising the land value tax nationally to 31%, and raising the nation’s tariffs across the board dramatically in a rejection of three decades of free trade.

-The nation’s first campaign finance regulations would be authored by a trio of Alabamans: George Wallace, Armistead Selden, and Albert Brewer. Yet, the Federal Elections Regulation Act would go much farther than its original goals of stopping interstate banks and corporations from donating and requiring the disclosure of other donations, creating a Department of Elections to oversee statewide election agencies, campaign finance, and “*monitor election processes*.” Excoriation of the new department has emerged as a central Preservationist campaign theme, accusing it of setting the stage for a complete fascist takeover of the United States.

-However, the utility of congressional Farmer-Labor would collapse as the party underwent a meltdown sparked by the detioriating relationship between House leaders Gerald Ford and Jesse Unruh. With both determined to hold the speakership for themselves in a conflict equal parts personal and ideological, Unruh would instigate a motion to vacate in August of 1957, winning the support of Preservationists in Congress, and crown himself speaker soon afterwards. Ford and Unruh would effectively trade the office between them for the next year, as a small cadre of Farmer-Laborites led by whip George Wallace held the balance in the party’s caucus. Consistently playing both sides to enflame the Ford-Unruh rivalry would be Progressive leader Richard Nixon, labelled by Tugwell “*a reactionary, savage political gut fighter*,”

-The architect of Quebec’s annexation to the United States, Maurice Duplessis would react to President Tugwell’s election with shock and horror. Openly touting his distaste for the President, Duplessis would cause a constitutional crisis as he was dismissed in 1957. Refusing to leave office as he accused Tugwell of violating the understanding of the people of Quebec, Quebec’s budding National Guard would mobilize against the United States Army, which Tugwell would fear would refuse to obey him itself after the events of the Christmas Coup. However, Congress would, in its only major action during the period of paralysis caused by the feud between Jesse Unruh and Gerald Ford, see both Unruh, Ford, and Nixon collaborate to pass the Second Quebec Organic Act, removing the appointed position of Territorial Governor to transition Quebec to complete democratic self rule, which would see Duplessis re-elected to govern until his death in 1959.

-Gerald Ford would consolidate his hold on the Speakership following the midterms of 1958 through the acceptance of an initiative pioneered by the President and supported by Jesse Unruh, albeit one that Ford himself would find repugnant: the Trumbo-Castro Act of 1960. Named for Colorado Senator Dalton Trumbo and Cuba Representative Fidel Castro, the most radical law of the Tugwell presidency, dubbed “*a strange mix of communism and fascism*” by Ben Gitlow and filibustered for a record 24 hours by Liberal Senate Leader Strom Thurmond, has limited all future land ownership to 500 acres while explicitly authorizing the Department of Planning to use the power of eminent domain for the redistribution of current lands, signed by President Tugwell with a promise to “*restore the land to the people in little pieces, let them grow food and make homes*.”

-While it has remained at the forefront of his presidency, hardly a dozen states have joined the President’s call for a constitutional convention, as of now blocking Tugwell’s dream. However, the idea of constitutional revision as a whole has spread like wildfire. Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey has introduced [an amendment reforming the electoral college](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/s/Iky2KuIS7t) that would come close to passing Congress, while President Tugwell has thrown himself behind an Amendment from Fidel Castro seeking to return to the United States to status as a secular nation once more by repealing the Jesus Amendment in its entirety. Past amendments that remain in limbo have also seen growing support, such as the Pappy O’Daniel’s proposal to reform the presidency to a single six year term, an amendment restricting presidential pardons,a proposal requiring a referendum to enter into war, and the abolition of judicial review, with a [revised Wagner Amendment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dk04oa/compromise_and_constitutionalism_peacockshah/) championed by former President Quesada being ratified in 1958 and the equal rights amendment coming only states away from ratification by the spring of 1960.

-An [Amendment proposed by actress turned Congresswoman Shirley Temple ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1e15dlp/temple_amendment_peacockshah_alternate_elections/)changing the date of presidential and congressional inaugurations to January 1st would be approved by Congress in 1957 and quickly make its way through state legislatures, becoming the 21st Amendment over the summer of 1959. Later that year, the much touted Amendment for a national referendum system would finally reach ratification by ¾ of state legislatures, stating that the President may call a national referendum on policy, to take place no more than 30 days and no fewer than 90 days after the declaration. Finally, a compromise Amendment between opponents of statehood and President Quesada’s calls for D.C.’s full participation in government that passed Congress in 1957 would be ratified in 1959 and celebrated in a joint ceremony with Quesada and Tugwell, becoming the 24th Amendment.

-Even as his institution passed between government and shared control, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernard Baruch has continued to oversee a fall in inflation to 2%. However, the United States economy, growing at rates above 5% annually since the end of the Third Pacific War, would experience a significant downturn in October 1959, with national unemployment rising from 3.4% to 7.5% as the stock market fell by 20%. With production declining, Tugwell would find an impetus to ramp up the building of his model cities and the implementation of his economic proposals.

-President Tugwell has sought a radical reshifting of American urban planning policy, a move cited by many as the greatest success of his presidency. Envisioning “*a city of neighborhoods making intensive use of all its living and working areas, but one which does not sprawl over peripheral slums and a rotting, half-demolished center.*” Although his dream of a planning branch of government through a new constitution has yet to be consummated, Tugwell has secured the passage of a cabinet-level Department of Planning, which has overseen a massive expansion of American cities under a series of master plans drawn up by the President himself, as well as other projects such as New York City’s World Trade Center.

-The city of Tulsa, Texas has been Tugwell’s magnum opus. Effectively drawn by Tugwell himself, a half dozen satellite cities have sprung up around the city center. Entirely managed by the Department of Planning, these cities have been populated by those from rural areas, still recovering from the ravaging of the Revolution, resettled by the government. Connected with public transit and built to incorporate both greenspace and walkability, Tugwell has cast the satellites of Tulsa as his greatest achievement.

-Similar efforts have sprung up across the Plains, controversially contributing to the depopulation of rural areas as Tugwell himself has cast his goal as being a “*moreorderlypatternfor theinevitablemovementfromfarmtocity*.” In laying out his entire vision, Tugwell has proposed three thousand of these planned cities to be built on cheap land at the outskirts of the nation’s present metropolises.

-Tugwell would preside over the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1959, introduced by Puerto Rico Senator Luis Munoz Marin, providing government funds to pay farmers not to produce as a means of lowering supply to increase prices. A colossal about face from three decades of Farmer-Labor agricultural policy focused on buying surpluses to sell abroad, Vice President Clement, already campaigning against the President for his opposition to the Jesus Amendment, has cited the act as the final straw in his relationship with the President, announcing his own 1960 presidential campaign within weeks of its passage.

-President Tugwell’s very suggestion that the United States might once more nationalize the General Trades Union would spark an uproar led by John L. Lewis and Jimmy Hoffa, denouncing the idea of any sort of government control over organized labor and driving the GTU into the arms of Frank G. Clement. Lewis and Hoffa would ring anew the bells of tyranny, harkening to their imprisonment in the second term of President La Follette, as Hoffa was prosecuted on accusations of bribery and connections to organized crime, implicating once more allies such as W.A. Boyle and the mysterious Frank Sheeran, who has rocketed to prominence in the union as a painter after Hoffa’s 1959 imprisonment.

-President Tugwell would soon move to reinstate Executive Order 15097, nationalizing the healthcare industry and establishing a National Healthcare Service. However, along with the initial nationalization of the Federal Reserve, the NHS would be disbanded by *Hickel v. United States*. Meanwhile, the Liberal Party, under the influence of Pierre Rinfret, has finally enshrined into its platform a basic health insurance plan, funded by a combination of sin taxes and the land value tax, mandatory for every citizen covering emergency care, annual doctor visits, injury treatment, and prenatal care, with supplemental private insurance plans available beyond this and a prohibition on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions.

-With Quesada era Energy Secretary Dixy Lee Ray presiding  over a monumental shift in focus from hydroelectric to nuclear power, Tugwell would continue the focus on nuclear pioneered by Quesada with a dozen new nuclear plants built under the Tugwell Administration. All are government owned and managed by the Department of Energy, making them controversial to the right. However, Tugwell has gone farther, suggesting that all atomic assets be placed under the ownership of a global entity ""*in a way so conclusive as to establish complete consensus.*”

-President Tugwell has refused to abide by the Blackshirts, the armed wing of the Farmer-Labor Party since 1936. Although continuing friendly relations with Governor Carl Elliott of Alabama, and dubbing the land of fascism “*the cleanest, most efficiently operating piece of social machinery I’ve ever seen…makes me envious*,” Tugwell has refused to host Blackshirts at events of any sort, while angering some by declaring “*the United States of America is as a reproach to all who seek to govern others without their consent. America has a destiny which will be reached by the processes of democracy, yet even in a democracy, progress is by no means automatic*,” a statement interpreted as a withdrawal from Milford W. Howard’s famed characterization of fascism as a “challenge to democracy.”

-Yet, Tugwell has not been free of anti-democratic instincts, being caught publicly in 1959 as stating that he wished he “*could have the press controlled so that they don’t scream lies at me daily*.” Throughout his presidency, Tugwell has held a continuous stream of radio and television addresses, explaining his policies and reading out his proposed constitution in an attempt to achieve “*mastery of radio and television*” with the aid of Press Secretaries India Edwards and I.F. Stone.

-The space race that began under President Quesada has continued with a furor, as both Russia and France reach for the stars. With the *Apollo* program, however, Tugwell has vowed to continue Quesada’s goal of putting a man on the moon. Astronauts Wally Schirra, John Glenn, Neil Armstrong, and Alan Shepard have captured the ional imagination, and would be jointly awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a 1960 ceremony to which former President Quesada would be invited in an attempt to host a bipartisan gesture of national unity in the quest for space domination. In addition to NASA, Tugwell has presided over the first American intercontinental ballistic missile.

-After a decade of direct American rule, Hawai’i has been returned to the [decentralized form of constitutional monarchy under loose American sovereignty](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/qcesxw/proposal_for_the_government_of_the_state_of/) that it maintained from the days of President Dewey until the Treaty of Tegucigalpa.

-Tugwell has focused on building up the American University in Washington, D.C., established by John Quincy Adams as a federal university. Declaring that “*just as a gracious church represents praise of God;, a lovely campus represents fondness for young men and women who are about to join their elders in the hard tasks of society,*” he has joined with Congress to appropriate funds for a campus expansion. Further, Tugwell has pushed Americans to enter athletics, noting the success of other public, mission oriented schools such as VMI, rated first in the [final 1957 Associated Press college football poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dxwe74/the_final_1957_ap_college_football_poll/).

-While not restarting the La Follette era mass sterilizations of criminals and the mentally ill, Tugwell has begun a series of voluntary birth control and sterilization programs under the aegis of the Department of Planning, targeting areas labeled as “overpopulated.” However, critics have noted that Tugwell’s program seemingly only targets women, not men, while the Department’s actions have been seen as biased towards seeking to control the population of people of color.

-Tugwell would call for a raising of the minimum wage, working with Liberal Senator Gale McGee of Wyoming to pass the McGee Act of 1959, raising it from $5.25 to $6.25.

-President Tugwell’s appointment of Will Rogers Jr. has been among several attempts to extend an olive branch to Liberals centered on attempting to equate his New State with the New Deal of John A. Lejeune.

-President Tugwell has filled the White House Garden with poinsettias, a parting gift from former President Quesada. In contrast to Quesada, Tugwell has been noted for his charming personality and abundant humor. Meanwhile, First Lady Grace Falke Tugwell has gained a national reputation as a promoter of art and feminism, notably presiding over the ribbon cutting of a Museum of Futurism in the National Mall and a [1958 World’s Fair sponsored by the Department of Culture](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1e22d3t/unity_above_all_psae/), featuring displays of American art and achievement showcasing national progress from the dark days of occupation.

-In a proposal widely panned for its partisanship, Tugwell has suggested building a monument on Georgia’s Stone Mountain featuring the visages of Presidents John Bidwell, Lyman Trumbull, William Jennings Bryan, and either Charles Lindbergh, Philip La Follette, or William Randolph Hearst–all, one will note, Farmer-Laborites. With opposition critics such as Walter Winchell joking that Tugwell ought to have gone all the way and suggested revolutionary leaders Richard F. Pettigrew and Thomas E. Watson, no progress has begun, but the idea of a monumental mountain to past Presidents has taken root.

-[Elevated to the position of Cardinal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/s/eIkBTA20Ct) in 1959 prior to the seminal “Vatican II” council called by Pope Urban, who would spend much of the council pushing for a focus on social justice, Fulton Sheen has continued as the nation’s most prominent Catholic. However, he has earned the ire of Representative Brent Bozell, once the mastermind of the Batista campaign, who has moved his focus from issues in American politics to instead devote time in Congress to denouncing the council’s lack of commitment to the traditional Latin mass.

-With the death of Israel A. Smith, succession for the leadership of the Mormon Church would come down to Ezra Taft Benson and N. Eldon Tanner, the latter of whom would succeed with the backing of the Smith family. Tanner, a socialist and social credit advocate, has once more steered the Church into the center of American politics.

-The Church of Immanuel has declared its founder Manuel Herrick perpetually living in contrast to the official story that he was killed in a California blizzard. Yet, as his successor Wallace Dodd Fard himself passed away in 1957, the room would be cleared for the lightning rise of a lawyer turned Immanuelist priest: John Erhlichman. Emerging as the Church’s new President, Erhlichman has placed it firmly into the political scene and prepared to reprise Herrick’s many runs for the presidency.

-Using the Pulitzer fortune of his wife, former President Pete Quesada has entered the entertainment industry, purchasing the Washington Nationals in 1957 on his way to becoming the national Commissioner of Baseball in 1959, while using additional funds to purchase the rights to promoting musical star Elvis Presley from Colonel Tom Parker, as Elvis, now drafted, has been stationed in the Philippines. Among Quesada’s primary rivals has been baseball star turned Congressman Fidel Castro of Cuba, who has accused the former President of mishandling management and being overly hostile to the media. Meanwhile, Presley would narrowly survive a 1959 plane crash in the Filipino province of Cebu while escorting[ President Vargas of the Philippines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1dxj6ar/1957_philippine_presidential_election_peacockshah/), causing a national crisis as Vargas’ death has brought anti-Tugwell Ramon Magsaysay to power.

-After taking a tour bus to their next concert in Minnesota, musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper had a successful touring season in 1959 and are planning an international tour for 1961.

-Former football star J. William Fulbright has become an advertising mascot for a partnership between McDonald’s and the Hydrox cookie company. In a famous television advertisement promoting the classic hippo burger, made from Louisiana raised hippopotamuses, Fulbright, sitting in his model of the wildly successful Ford Edsel, raises a takeaway glass of Pepsi before declaring that nothing does down better than “*a hippo burger and a Hydrox!*” However, through a deal with former Secretary of the Interior Robert Yellowtail, rival chain Burger King has unveiled a bison burger promoted by Bob Devaney, coach of the [victorious Wyoming college football team.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/s/POxlXDgHYL)

-Notable inventions and scientific breakthroughs during President Tugwell’s term include the post-it note, pineapple pizza, and the eight track tape.

**The Supreme Court:**

-Justice Maud McClure Kelly would retire in 1957 after a decade on the bench, with Tugwell selecting the relatively neutral and non-partisan Judge Burnita Shelton Matthews as her replacement. However, Speaker of the House Ford would surprise many by calling for the appointment of former Vice President Michael A. Musmanno, with even the suggestion prompting widespread denunciation from Preservationists. Tugwell has sought to keep Musmanno at arm’s length, rarely consulting the now reclusive Pennsylvanian.

-Further, Ford would call for the impeachment of Quesada appointed Justice John J. Sirica, accusing Sirica of corruption. Tugwell appointed Robert F. Kennedy as a Special Counsel in 1960 to investigate Ford’s allegations, but has otherwise not taken action.

-President Tugwell signed an executive order fully nationalizing the Federal Reserve on April 1st of 1957, among the first actions of his presidency. Protests against the action, and, implicitly, against the possibility of Tugwell making similarly broad actions via executive order akin to Presidents Lindbergh and La Follette, would come to a head as Governor Wally Hickel of Tannenbaum sued the Administration, arguing that the action was unconstitutional and rendered the Federal Reserve’s dealings with Tannenbaum state government invalid. In a 1958 decision, the Court would overturn both Tugwell’s actions and the wider precedent of the New State by a 5-4 vote in *Hickel v. United States*, with Justice G. Harold Carswell authoring a sweeping majority opinion against an exasperated Chief Justice Hugo Black’s dissent, appealing to precedent and pointing to the usage of executive power in times of crisis.

-Irate over the actions of the Court, President Tugwell would support a bill introduced by Burton K. Wheeler to expand the size of the court to fifteen justices. Accused of being a movement towards dictatorship by prominent Progressives such as Hamilton Fish III, the bill would emulate many of Tugwell’s other dreams in the act of dying in committee.

Long story short, my daughter has been in a private school which I love for Kinder and 1st grade. Unfortunately my husband lost his job and we are struggling to make the tuition. We also have a younger kid in preschool that we are paying tuition for. 

I just feel bad because my daughter is doing so well at this school and has made great friends. I don't want her to be sad or it to have a negative impact on her academic or social life. I don't want her to feel alone. And I just have guilt because our finances have changed so drastically, that I am unable to keep her at her current school. The new school we found is great. Its a Blue Ribbon school in a great neighborhood. Its small and in a close knit community. I already met a mom who is in the PTA on reddit lol. 

Has anyone ever experienced this? Should I try to get a second job to keep her in the private school? 

Also, my younger kid could attend Pre-K there in the fall (age wise, I just have to get her in). So they could be going to school together. "

Project Management vs. Marketing,MBA,1e07fts,2024-07-10 17:26:09,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1e07fts/project_management_vs_marketing/,beracuda31,Careers/Post Grad,"**Hi MBA Community!**

I’m hoping to tap into some of your personal and professional experience and advice.

I’m officially halfway through my online MBA (not top 15). I know, I’m not at one of the greatest programs. I’m not a Yale, I’m not a Stanford, but some of my peers are graduates and have incredible careers because of it. I pursued this degree because I’m an empath stuck in a cutthroat corporate bubble, trying to break the cubicle chain. My work is also covering some of the costs, so don’t call me crazy yet.

I’m 28 years old, with a unique background in corporate global retail, and I’m not sure what’s next post-graduation (next summer). I understand that the area of emphasis may not matter significantly, and some great programs don’t even have one, but I value my coursework and what I’ve learned outside the workplace. I am eager to leverage this knowledge to open up opportunities for myself in the future.

I’m at a crossroads, and it’s driving me crazy. I’m hoping you can offer advice, tell me I’m crazy, enlighten me, or help me calm down. Really, anything you think would put my heart at ease. I’m trying to decide whether to aim for a career in Marketing or Project Management.

My Dad gave me great advice when I was young: “Make a list of pros and cons if you don’t know what to decide.” I’m hoping you could agree or object to my personal pros and cons and help me decide which direction to take.

**About Me:**

* I’m very empathetic and optimistic.
* I get along with literally anyone.
* I have a bachelor’s degree in Business (marketing minor) and am obtaining my MBA from the same college 5 years later, great group of networking! My schools not a cash grab I promise…I never really like the classroom so believe me, I wouldn’t be getting this MBA from a college I didn’t trust.
* I have a Type A work style but a Type B personality.
* I’ve got **6 years of corporate** retail experience, ranging from **product development** (materials) to **Product Lifecycle Management** and **Financial Planning** for three major global brands.
* Beige and fluorescent cubicles are my psych ward. I love my remote days working next to my puppy (seriously, I'm by far more productive/motivated).
* I’m a creative mind but a tactical executor.
* I’m willing to prioritize mental health over salary.
* Call me what you want, but I’m done with the “grind.” At the end of the day, it’s a job. I’m not going to work late hours anymore. Don’t expect me to sacrifice my personal life for work. I did that too much in the three years after undergrad and was laid off after “exceeding expectations” in my role for three years straight. My Dad's less than useful advice ""be the first to arrive, and last to the leave the office"" got me laid off (4 years..) without a single offer of a transferable branch in the business.

**Pros and Cons (listed in order of importance to me):**

**Project Management Route:**

**Pros:**

* Typically higher salary (than marketing)
* Higher chance of working from home
* Consulting would allow me to take on multiple projects at once
* Less of the “American dream corporate hoop jumping” (don’t have to “bleed” the corporate logo colors)
* PMP certification application – my financial planning experience could account for the majority of the hours required to apply

**Cons:**

* PMP Certification – I could still fail (but I’m confident in my ability to pass) and be SOL
* Certifications in general – Which to get, will they matter if I pivot, who’s paying, will I qualify?
   * I’m pretty nervous about this..I’m cringing thinking of doing more test taking and studying after I walk across the graduation stage. In other words, I’m ready to get to work.
* From the networking I’ve done, the first three years post-grad are grind, grind, grind, and hope, hope, hope for something to stick. I’m ready to have kids and build a home. I’m more mentally invested in those things. I spent my 20s “grinding,” and it led me to pursuing an MBA in hopes of a better career path.
* Worried about “starting over” in a corporate setting (always being the “yes man,” simple tasks completed with a bow and a ribbon, volunteering for extra work, etc.)
* Uncertainty of which industry I decide to pursue and if I’ll be stuck in one/dead ends (engineering, tech, pharma, etc.)
* I've done well in finance, but am becoming ""meh"" over math. (In other words, I'll do just fine, but I'm not on the edge of my seat with excitement)
* Introverts tend to excel in this line of work

**Marketing Route:**

**Pros:**

* Wider range of industry opportunities and enhanced flexibility
* Creative/product-oriented outlook and practices. I'm very passionate in things that I believe in or excite me.
* I'm very talented in story telling and product personification.
* Extroverts tend to succeed
* Travel? (question mark because I don’t care if I don’t, but it could be cool if I did)
* Making a difference in the world (depends on the company, stories, affiliations, etc.)
* I’ve loved my marketing teammates in the past

**Cons:**

* Becoming an oversaturated job market
* Appeasing the C-suite and bleeding the company colors (corporate hoop jumping, smiling front row at the town hall...I'm getting a worse and worse poker face)
* Travel (could also be a con if it requires a lot of travel; I don’t want to leave the chores to my wife for extensive amounts of time)
* Typically lower median salary (than project management)
* Opportunity Cost: financial field opportunities (my skillset in finance could’ve been for nothing)

I hope this post is allowed. I’m not trying to sell myself, but I think this is categorized as “advice.” I learned a lot about corporate life in my 20s, but I know what I want: family, mental health, and stability. Salary, career advancement, and the American Dream come after.

And if everything I’ve just said doesn’t look promising for that future either way...guess I’ll join the Van Life subreddit."
