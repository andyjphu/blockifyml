5 coins I would recommend buying right now (with explanations),WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i54bub,2025-01-19 12:52:45,28,0.79,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1i54bub/5_coins_i_would_recommend_buying_right_now_with/,InnerAbrocoma9880,DD,"I'm a day trader with a \~$300K portfolio and here's what I bought yesterday in preparation for the next (hopefully) bull run:

* **Sperax ($SPA)**: massively undervalued since its last pump where it was sitting comfortably at the $0.02 range. It's currently just at $0.014 which I'm confident is the bottom. The ATH of this coin was $0.24, so big potential.
* **Tezos ($XTZ)**: has likely hit the bottom at around $1.30. This coin has reached $10 on previous bull runs. Also on Coinbase, there is up to 7% staking with only a 2-day unstaking time, which is actually really good.
* **Ribbon Finance ($RBN)**: also undervalued. Currently at $0.34, but primed to lock back into the $0.40 - 0.50 range. In the 2024 bull run, it reached $1.80.
* **Pangolin ($PNG)**: undervalued at $0.29. This coin can pump to the $0.70 - 0.80 range on bull runs.
* **Kyber Network ($KNC)**: I've been tracking this coin for years. It tends to dart between the $0.50 and $1 range quite often, so is perfect for trading. But it also reached an instance ATH of $6 a few years ago.

Obviously I'm not a financial adviser, but hopefully these tips are at least useful food for thought. Good luck!"

Ready for moonshot gains? Dive into my latest report on the ‚ÄòTop 3 100X Potential Gems for today, February 12, 2024. Explore the assets skyrocketing in this dynamic financial terrain.

1. **PacketCrypt $PKT 46.1%**

 PKT Network is a global VPN mesh, offering fast, secure connectivity. Users earn PKT Cash by sharing bandwidth, supported by Lightning Network for scalability. It‚Äôs a nonprofit, decentralized ISP, fostering a censorship-resistant wifi mesh for an inclusive digital future. $PKT was recently listed on MEXC and you can sign up to MEXC and [**start trading it now**](https://www.mexc.com/register?inviteCode=14mwG).   


 2. **Sperax $SPA 48.4%**   


https://preview.redd.it/bcfnx6ce06ic1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5a0702a636a0746807cf4912ad0e6eebcc834ea

 $SPA is soaring in value after distributing 400K tokens to veSPA holders in an airdrop. With ongoing buybacks, it‚Äôs steadily set to reclaim its previous all time high. Investing in $SPA now seems compelling, given its upward momentum and consistent growth. A return to all time high prices would be approximately 20X from its current price. The cheapest way to start trading $SPA is via [**MEXC**](http://start%20trading%20it%20now./).   


 3. **Nosana $NOS 1359% since launch**

 Nosana is part of the hot DePin narrative, and I am hyper bullish for it to easily go past $1 Billion marketcap for this bull cycle. This project has printed millionaires and will continue to do so. You can buy $NOS from Solana. If you need to get $Sol tokens to fund your Phantom wallet, you can get it [**here**](https://www.mexc.com/register?inviteCode=14mwG).

"List of degen crypto ""projects"" that scammer/rugpulled in the last months",CryptoCurrency,15h1ofs,2023-08-03 07:36:07,34,0.78,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15h1ofs/list_of_degen_crypto_projects_that/,Allions1,ANALYSIS,"Welcome to another episode of ""beware it's a scam""! The analysis of scam/ponzi/MLM crypto ""trading companies"" or tokens that are clearly a scam.

Here is an updated list of DEGEN crypto ""projects"" that rug pulled/scammed/failed in the last 6 months:

* **Alpha Capital . app**: see my detailed [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10eka9z/alpha_capital_claims_that_got_hacked_and_lost_90/) about this. They were giving  ‚âà 1,15% daily on BNB, BUSD, MATIC or USDC. Claimed to get gains from direct trading of team. Refunded 10% and asked investors if wanted to stay with the platform or be refunded totally. Sent some total refund but still a lot of others users are waiting to be completely refunded. See linked post for details of the ""hack"". Total money on the platform the 16/01/2023, at the time of the hack : around 2,100,000$ in crypto. Website still online, telegram channel still online but in ""read only mode"". After full refunding who asked, they claims that will keep trading for the other users but will not accept any more deposts (Note: still a lot of users claims that did not received any full refund, even if they asked).
* **Yield Robot . app**: 2% daily on BUSD pool. Founder was ""Maneesh Agrawala"", Co-Founder was ""Lia Adams"", with pictures of two bored apes on the official website, instead of real photographs. The team said that they were earning through ""AI Investing, algorithms and AI machine learning"".  Telegram channel disappeared, website unreachable. Total money on the platform when rug occured:  3,412,665$.
* **Circulate . money**:  from 2% to 5% daily in BNB, BUSD, AVAX or USDC. 12.01.2023 website unreachable and smart contract depleted. Total money on the platform when rug occured:   2,357,872$.
* **RelyFund**: 2% on BSC, ETH, AVAX, USDC via bot trading. After one of the co-founders and main trader claimed to being involved in a traffic accident, breaking one arm, they decided to pull the plug and leave the contract open to for withdrawals until depleted. Right know the website is unreachable, Discord and telegram were closed the 20.01.2023. Total money on the platform when closing occured: 4,236,104 $.
* **BNB Profites** **.cc**: different cryptocurrencies to deposit. 5 types of investment, from ***4,5% hourly*** to *400% after 7 days* (LOL!). Website now is unreachable.
* **Prosperity Gem Ventures .io**: 2% daily, deposits available in BSC, TRON, and Polygon. Team is earning through LP staking and bot trading. Deposits are unavailable for some pools but platform is still online.
* **BUSD Oracle**:  2,2% daily on BUSD via smart contract. Website still reachable but no information if they are still operating.
* **Titano. finance**:  102483% APY  (yes, 102k%!) holding the proprietary token (TITANO). Token was worth ‚âà0.15$ in April 2022, now is worth ‚âà0.000015. Website was taken down and up again, it now redirects to **swych.** **finance**, similar token SWYCH and similar offer. TITANO has no transaction today.
* r**obotics .online**: 465% APY,  deposit were available in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Tether.  They claimed to be around since 2018.  MR. ""Michael Stark"" was the CEO. Controversial reviews on trustpilot and website today gives an error.
* **Haru invest .com**: up to 25% APY on ETH, BTC, USDT, USDC. Platform halted withdrawals and operations some months ago. It was known in this subreddit (has also an officialsubreddit). Multiple news about the event can be found on main crypto websites.
* **Firefund .finance:** deposit BUSD via BSC, 0,5% daily. The smart contract cannot let devs withdraw more than 10% of contract amount per week. There is alo a whale fee of 50% for withdrawals of amounts bigger than 10% of contract.  The project suffered a ""bank run"" initiated by some whale and now contract are empty. The team has said that will refund investors in 6 months-1years, but no new money is accepted in smart contracts.
* **wolfcapital** **.app**: users can enter a ""wolfpack"" and earn up to 1,5% daily. Project suffered a bank run and team withdraw the contract, promising a new contract  to go live on August 14th.

There are also some ""projects""  (quotation marks are needed) that are still going on but some of them had multiple losses/problems. Please be extremely careful if you ever think to invest in those. Here they are:

* **optimus** **.money** : 1% for holder of OPT3, team earns from bot trading and pays out with proprietary token. Token lost 99% of value, from 0.01 to 0.001. Still operating today after more than 6 months.
* **Ark . finance:** deposit BUSD to get 2% APY on proprietary token ARKFI . Token lost 90% of value and is highly inflationatory.  Still operating today after more than 6 months.
* **Myst . fi**: from 0,5 % to 1,5% daily on BUSD and MXST (% depends on how much of proprietary token is held) through ""*proprietary algorithm-driven trading bot and dApp that uses deep technical indicators & on-chain data analysis to action trades & maximize your daily profits.*"". Project still going on. Unknown losses/problems.
* **Aperture . finance**: 0,3% daily on AVAX paired with others crypto currencies. Still operating. Unknown losses/problems.
* **flynt** **.finance**: BTC 30% APY, ETH 9% APY, USDC 12% APY.  BTC suffered huge losses during the last months (-30%, -10% of the capital a couple of times).
* **Margin Syndicate**: direct trading up to 30% monthly through trading via API, with own account on ByBit or Binance. BOT trading is available but less profitable (up to 8% monthly). Fees must be paid manually at EOM. Account suffered huge losses in may/june 2023 a couple of time, they are recovering little by little.
* **Sperax USD (USDs)**: stablecoin on arbitrium chian that let holders earn up to 12% APY. Just holding the USDs  in a cold wallet let you gain the earnings. There are also ""farms"" available were investors can stakes USDs and SPA for higher yield. Devs claims that Sperax USD is 100% collateralized by stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. They suffered an hack some months ago, but the white hat hacker returned funds and they fixed the hack. Now they are operating normally.
* **Kronos trading**: 3-8% monthly with algorithmic trading through API with own account on ByBit or Binance, on KRONOS or Bitcoin. BTC trading had huge losses reported also on the website. Kronos trading had minor losses.

"SperaxUSD on Arbitrum was exploited, hacker managed to liquidate around ~300k before it was stopped. Then, on Feb 6th, he returned the fund. Exploit will be patched tomorrow and ops will resume.",CryptoCurrency,10vw4ea,2023-02-07 02:44:54,12,0.83,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10vw4ea/speraxusd_on_arbitrum_was_exploited_hacker/,Allions1,DISCUSSION,"[https://sperax.io/](https://sperax.io/) Official website of the project

SperaxUSD is a stablecoin collateralized by other stablecoins, that gives \~11% APY just by holding in the wallet (even col wallet). Project is directly linked with ""Sperax"", the main token of the platform. For further info details can be found on the official website. 

[As stated in their official twitter account](https://twitter.com/SperaxUSD/status/1622003045776195587), on February 4th the SperaxUSD protocol on Arbitrum chain was exploited. The Sperax team claimed that an exploiter was able to increase the token balance for their address to 9.7bln tokens without providing matching collateral and was able to liquidate around \~300k USDs before he was stopped by joint actions of the Sperax team and Arbitrum ecosystem partners. 

Sperax team has identified the exploiter‚Äôs accounts on CEXs, and all USDs transactions and the smart contract were blocked on  Feb 4, 03:11 AM UTC. Team stated on that moment that liquidated amount will be recapitalized by the Sperax team before relaunching the protocol. 

It is important to note that SperaxUSD‚Äôs governance token SPA was not affected by the exploit. USDs was able to maintain its peg that fluctuated in a slightly broader range than usual - between 0.97 and 1.02 USDs/USD (as can be seen from CMC or others crypto monitoring website). Sperax lost around 10% during this situation but has already recovered.

The team then reached out to the exploiter to discuss options. The issue was figured out and will be resolved with a smart contract upgrade. Recapitalization will be implemented early next week, then transactions will restart. 

Team [stated](https://twitter.com/SperaxUSD/status/1622719484598386711) that on Februray 6th the hacker returned the funds, and tomorrow a patch will be implemented to fix this exploit. 

[Exploit details can be found here.](https://medium.com/sperax/usds-feb-3-exploit-report-from-engineering-team-9f0fd3cef00c)

"List of reckless DeFi crypto ""projects"" with high yield - very likely scams - that rugpulled recently + list of other projects still going on.",CryptoCurrency,10k7nrq,2023-01-24 10:11:58,12,0.72,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10k7nrq/list_of_reckless_defi_crypto_projects_with_high/,Allions1,DISCUSSION,"[Following my post regarding Alpha Capital being ""hacked""](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10eka9z/alpha_capital_claims_that_got_hacked_and_lost_90/) and losing investor's funds, here is an updated list about crypto ""projects"" with semi impossible high yields that rug pulled/scammed investors in the last month.

* **Alpha Capital . app**: see my detailed [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10eka9z/alpha_capital_claims_that_got_hacked_and_lost_90/) about this. They were giving  ‚âà 1,15% daily on BNB, BUSD, MATIC or USDC. Claimed to get gains from direct trading of team. Refunded 10% and asked investors if wanted to stay with the platform or be refunded totally. Sent some total refund but still a lot of others users are waiting to be completely refunded. See linked post for details of the ""hack"". Total money on the platform the 16/01/2023, at the time of the hack : around 2,100,000$ in crypto. Website still online, telegram channel still online but in ""read only mode"". After full refunding who asked, they claims that will keep trading for the other users but will not accept any more deposts (Note: still a lot of users claims that did not received any full refund, even if they asked).
* **Yield Robot . app**: 2% daily on BUSD pool. Founder was ""Maneesh Agrawala"", Co-Founder was ""Lia Adams"", with pictures of two bored apes on the official website, instead of real photographs. The team said that they were earning through ""AI Investing, algorithms and AI machine learning"". 17.01.2023 Telegram channel disappeared, website unreachable. Total money on the platform when rug occured:  3,412,665$ (as dune.com reports)
* **Circulate . money**:  from 2% to 5% daily in BNB, BUSD, AVAX or USDC. 12.01.2023 website unreachable and smart contract depleted. Total money on the platform when rug occured:   2,357,872$ (as dune.com reports)
* **RelyFund**: 2% on BSC, ETH, AVAX, USDC via bot trading. After one of the co-founders and main trader claimed to being involved in a traffic accident, breaking one arm, they decided to pull the plug and leave the contract open to for withdrawals until depleted. Right know the website is unreachable, Discord and telegram were closed the 20.01.2023. Total money on the platform when closing occured: 4,236,104 $ (as dune.com reports)
* **BNB Profites** **.cc**: different cryptocurrencies to deposit. 5 types of investment, from ***4,5% hourly*** to *400% after 7 days* (LOL!). Website still online.  After seeing the APY% didn't even bother in reading anything else on the website.
* **Prosperity Gem Ventures .io**: 2% daily, deposits available in BSC, TRON, and Polygon. Team is earning through LP staking and bot trading. Deposits are unavailable for some pools but platform is still online.
* **BUSD Oracle**:  2,2% daily on BUSD via smart contract. Website still reachable but no information if they are still operating.

There are also more ""legit"" projects  (quotation marks are needed) that are still going on, without being a blatant scam but that I consider sketchy. Here is a small list. Please be advised that being included or not included in the list does not means that they can/cannot be a scam.

* **optimus** **.money** : 1% for holder of OPT3, team earns from bot trading and pays out with proprietary token. Website online and operating.
* **Titano. finance**:  102483% APY  (yes, 102k%!) holding the proprietary token (TITANO). Token was worth ‚âà0.15$ in April 2022, now is worth ‚âà0.000015. Still operating, website reachable.
* **Ark . finance:** deposit BUSD to get 2% APY on proprietary token ARKFI . Still operating, website reachable.
* **Robotics .online**: 465% APY,   deposit available in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Tether.  They claims to be around since 2018.  Michael Stark is the CEO. Controversial reviews on trustpilot, but website still online and operating.

Now here is a list of other **high risk projects** that can be considered legit, just for comparison with the above.  While I cannot be completely sure about them and are commonly considered ""very high risk"", they are not blatant scams as others above (IN MY OPINION). I am posting this to show you the huge differences with the others platforms that I have analyzed above.

* **Myst . fi**: from 0,5 % to 1,5% daily on BUSD and MXST (% depends on how much of proprietary token is held) through ""*proprietary algorithm-driven trading bot and dApp that uses deep technical indicators & on-chain data analysis to action trades & maximize your daily profits.*"". Project still going on, website reachable. Telegram group still available with more than 19k people in it.
* **Firefund .finance:** deposit BUSD via BSC, 0,5% daily. Similar to others above but with the important difference that the smart contract cannot let devs withdraw more than 10% of contract amount per week. There is alo a whale fee of 50% for withdrawals of amounts bigger than 10% of contract.  Team claims to earns through trading.
* **Aperture . finance**: 20% APY on AVAX paired with others crypto currencies. Reported on some news website too.
* **Crypto4Winners .com**: 4-8% on ETH, USDT, BTC pool. Crypto hedge funds that earns through trading, staking, lending, bot trading. Already known in this subreddit (has also a unofficial subreddit).
* **Peccala .com**: 2 investment strategies (high risk around 120% APY, and medium risk around 60% APY), paid in proprietary PECC token.
* **Haru invest .com**: up to 25% APY on ETH, BTC, USDT, USDC. platform that earns through leverage and similar. Already known in this subreddit (has also an officialsubreddit).
* **flynt** **.finance**: BTC 30% APY, ETH 9% APY, USDC 12% APY. Teams earn through trading.
* **Kronos trading**: 3-8% monthly with algorithmic trading through APY with own account on ByBit or Binance.
* **Margin Syndicate**: direct trading up to 30% monthly through direct trading via APY, with own account on ByBit or Binance. BOT trading is available but less profitable (up to 8% monthly). Fees must be paid manually at EOM.
* **Sperax USD (USDs)**: stablecoin on arbitrium chian that let holders earn up to 12% APY. Just holding the USDs  in a cold wallet let you gain the earnings. There are also ""farms"" available were investors can stakes USDs and SPA for higher yield. Devs claims that Sperax USD is 100% collateralized by stablecoins such as USDT and USDC.

Ever wonder what makes the USDs peg so strong?!? Curious to hear a thoughtful discussion about stablecoin risk management?!?

**This is the AMA for you!**

Just as a reminder - USDs is a hybrid stablecoin that is collateralized with USDC and USDT between 90-95%. This produces a stable $1 peg along with the strong algorithmic component. See the recent peg defense post [here](https://medium.com/sperax/the-first-stress-test-for-the-sperax-design-43a3134210e5) for more details on how it holds up during stressful situations.

Not all stablecoins are the same. USDs peg is strong and produces an 11% auto-yield. What can be better than a stablecoin that forks out inflation?!?"

KuCoin remains committed to discovering the next hidden gems in the crypto  space and so we are actively adding new coins to our platform all the  time. Previously, we posted all listing-related info in the Subreddit to keep everyone informed. However, some users feel that method is a bit  spammy, so we are trying another way to deliver such info.

We  will now start summarizing all listing-related info within the week  into one post so that you can easily get the whole picture, as well as  find detailed information regarding each listing.

When you stake your SPA it will be converted into veSPA to earn rewards. Lock up your SPA for longer periods of time for even greater rewards!

The rewards come in the form of more SPA! Rewards are generated through multiple sources;

\-100% of protocol fees

\- 50% of yield generated

\- Sponsored SPA rewards

This will create various benefits for the SPA/USDs ecosystem and their holders. SPA stakers realize new revenue streams, massive SPA buybacks from the protocol, supply shock from lockups, and long term incentive alignment!

This team continues to deliver! Come be a part of the action!
