April 3rd 689

Another quiet morning during the blockading of port Lynch by Arrun. The crew Abord the Alliance Flag ship the Esmeralda prepares to continue its mission of bombarding the port into submission with the smaller Corvette class and Galley Class ships with it.

Thats when suddenly a war horn rings out in the silent morning air.

The ships lookout reports to Captain Aurthor Prat of the Esmeralda and Admiral of the Alliances Blockading fleet a force of 50 Saderan warships are closing in.

Aurthor Prat quickly orders his sailors and the fleet into battle formation as the stage is set for the first battle and Naval battle of the war. 23 Alliance ships vs 50 Saderan ships.

**Naval strategies by both sides leading up to the battle.**

Both sides wanted to maximize their advantages and minimize their weakness to successfully combat their enemies in battle.

On the Saderan side Admiral Fabian Florence sought to utilize the Saderan navies numerical superiority against what they saw as backwards barbarians and defeat them in one decisive naval battle however Admiral Grau Tiberius sought too instead have the Saderan navy perform raiding actions across the Eastern Alliance coastline and engage in smaller battles to slowly wear out the Eastern Alliances navy.

On the Eastern Alliance side General Juan Septimus sought to dive the alliance navy. One side would engage the Saderans in a series of naval battles to score one crushing blow after another utilizing superior ships while a smaller portion began blockading the Saderan cost to cut off Naval communications. 

[Admiral Juan Septimus of the Eastern Alliance.](https://preview.redd.it/vmboreo6n6fe1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b7b6047430c5a3ab003f0e9e456a5aa3257f66)

Another strategy Juan advocated was a fighting retreat tactic against Sadera in naval battles to preserve as many ships as possible. The loss of a Man of war class ship would be a devasting blow to the Alliance and the loss of such an expensive class of ship was to be avoided at all costs.



**Early Naval Campaign, the battle of port Lynch, and the battle of Cape Wannoa**

The Naval campaign of the war began that March as on March 6th the Alliance navy took off. The Navy was divided in 3 squadrons. The Leviathan Sea Squadron made up of 60 ships was tasked with Blockading Saderan Northeastern ports. The South Ocean Squadron made up of 27 ships and under the personal command of Juan Septimus was to attempt to snake up pass the Vassal state peninsula and blockade the ports of the Elbe and Mudwan as well as launch raids. The Final Squadron the Avion Sea Squadron made up of 23 ships and led by Vice Admiral Aurthor Prat a seasoned naval commander was ordered to blockade the Port city of Lynch which was the only port in the Saderan province of Avion. 

  
Aurthor Prats squadron was the first to go into action as it arrived at port Lynch on March the 15th with a speed so surprising the local Sadera naval force of 10 Galley's in the nearby area weren't able to get to the port in time to prevent the enviable. Instead of attempting to make battle with a numerical superior opponent the Saderan naval squadron alerted the Saderan naval command.

Saderan naval command was sluggish to respond to the rapid naval advance of an enemy they viewed as lowly barbarians so they kicked the can down the road for around 2 weeks trying to process what was happening. The only person in Saderan admiralty to respond properly was Admiral Grau who cobbled up a fleet of 50 Warships among them 3 Tribute Class and 7 Emperor Class and took off for Port Lynch on March 27th.

  
Meanwhile Admiral Juan Septimus changed the course of his South Ocean Squadron and headed directly for the major Saderan port of Deahis and Propter in an attempt to gain control of the blue sea, blockade the 2 ports and to threaten the Empires capital of Sadera from the sea. 

However, as the South Ocean Fleet made its way towards the 2 largest ports of Sadera the fleet of Admiral Grau or now renamed Fleet Molt headed forward to engage the fleet of Aurthor Prat at Port Lynch.

April 3rd 689

Another quiet morning during the blockading of port Lynch by Arrun. The crew Abord the Alliance Flag ship the Esmeralda prepares to continue its mission of bombarding the port into submission with the smaller Corvette class and Galley Class ships with it.

Thats when suddenly a war horn rings out in the silent morning air.

The ships lookout reports to Captain Aurthor Prat of the Esmeralda and Admiral of the Alliances Blockading fleet a force of 50 Saderan warships are closing in.

Aurthor Prat quickly orders his sailors and the fleet into battle formation. At an instant the sailors of the Esmerald head to their positions as well as the sailors in the rest of the ships.

Meanwhile on the Flagship of the Admiral Grau the Conquest, the order was given for the battle standard to be raised on the sails which is was causing all the other ships in his fleet to follow in suit.

As his fleet got into attack formation to punch into the Alliance fleet, he made a speech to encourage them for the upcoming battle. The speech was projected across the fleet using a listeners stone.

""Sailors and soldiers of Fleet molt, the time has come to punish the enemies of Sadera once more. The empire shall be counting on you to deliver us the heads of the enemies to be lain on the feet of the emperor as a testament to our great victory. Victory means sharing glory that will go down in history as the finest naval victory in our empire's history. Let this day become a great tale that shall go down in our history. Long live the empire! Long live the emperor!""-Admiral Grau Tiberius. 

  
At that very moment the population of port Lynch awakened to the sound of their savior's war horns as the Saderan fleet had arrived to put an end to the blockade.

The Garrasion and the people of the port crowded around the walls to watch the naval engagement about to take place. 

On his part Admiral Prat knowing that combat was inevitable organized the fleet into a tightly packed formation to provide support and also like Admiral Grau gave a speak to encourage the sailors under his command.

""Gentlemen battle and death is inevitable, but I expect valor and courage from you. Never has our flag fallen to the Saderans and it won't fall today. I assure you that as long as I live our battle standard shall never fall into the hands of the enemy. If I die my officers shall know how to fulfill their duties to the end. Long live the Alliance!""- Admiral Aurthor Prat.

It was 4:30 in the afternoon and as both fleets began to close in the fire shots were fired as a Saderan ballista with a fire arrows splashed into the water nearly hitting the Alliance corvette the Tempest. Author Prat at this moment ordered 2 Corvettes led by the Tempest to escort the 5 transport ships in the fleet away from combat to prevent any valuable supplies from being sunk.

  
The Esmerald the flag ship of the Avion sea fleet and a man of war class was the first alliance ship to open fire unleashing a full broadside of cannon fire at the Saderan Galley's. Having never encountered gun powdered weaponry before the Saderan Galley's were caught off guard. The Saderan Galley the August was sunk immediately as the cannon balls of the 6 guns on the right side of the Esmerald punched into the hull. The Galley went down and took with it its entire crew of 300 or so sailors and enslaved rowers.

Following their flag ships example the Alliance Galley classes also opened fired at full broadside sinking a further 1 Galley and damaging 3. Lacking the range of the Man of war class the Galley class ships in the Alliance fleet missed most of their targets. 

At 5 pm the Saderan fleet spilt in two at orders of Admiral Grau to cut off and corner the outnumbered Alliance vessels and get into ramming range. Several of the Saderan vessels were also responding to the broadsides of ballista and cannon projectiles of then Avion Sea fleet with their own Trebuchets and enchanted ballista projectiles.

Seeing that the Saderan fleet was intending to encircle his Aurthor Prat relayed orders for his fleet to sail Easter wards to avoid themselves from being cut off. While the withdrawal was in place Author Prat made his ship take the brunt of the Saderan attack personally covering the retreat while also damaging a further 2 Saderan Galleys.

However, things begin to go for the worst when a well-placed Saderan trebuchet projectile slammed into the deck of the Esmerald Damaging the ship.

Meanwhile Admiral Grau ordered his second in command Admiral Garvus to pursue the Corvettes and Transport ships fleeing the battle with his Galley's and Emperor Class ship the Glory while bulk of the Saderan fleet would confront of the Esmerald as it covered its fellow ships retreat.

Like that the bulk of the Saderan fleet began to cut the distance between them and the Esmerald as the Esmerald unleashed broadside after broadside of Cannon fire forcing several ships to retreat to avoid being damaged while also sinking another galley.

By 6 pm the Saderans fleets attempts to get into ramming distance of the Esmerald had failed as the lone Man of War Class ship and the Saderan fleet engaged in a ranged duel. Aurthor Prat had by this point succeeded in buying time for the rest of his fleets escape so he piloted his ship the Esmerald to begin to break off from the long-range duel and to join the rest of the retreating fleet. However, as the Esmerald retreated it was hit again this time by an enchanted ballista projectile which destroyed the mast of the ship and killed several sailors slowing down the ships retreat as the main Saderan fleet moved in for the kill.

Deciding that combat had gone on for too long Admiral Grau moved his Emperor class flag ship directly towards the Esmerald to ram it. Grau's ship the conquest launched itself at the Esmerald at full speed. Admiral Prat seeing the Conquest heading straight for it order his gunners to target the ship and tried to steer his ship out of the wall of the incoming conquest however the conquest got their first ramming its prow directly into the Esmerald's hull before firing its Ballistaes at point blank range slaughtering several of the Esmerald's gunners and crew. 

Seeing the situation unravel but determined to fight to the end Captain Aurthor Prat gave the order to bord the Conquest as he led 60 sailors over the deck and onto the Galley beginning a melee on board the deck of the conquest.

The outnumbered Alliance soldiers and their Admiral hacked their way through the Galley leaving behind 54 dead Saderans before being stopped before they could overtake the command deck and in a sharp Melee Aurthor Prat was killed and beheaded and the rest of the borders killed.

After the failed boarding attempt the Conquest pulled out of its ramming of the Esmerald and shot fire arrows into the Man of War class ship lighting it on fire and incinerating any remaining crew as the ship went down with all hands still firing its cannons even as it burned.

 

[The Esmerald going down in the distance.](https://preview.redd.it/lx3py9t7d7fe1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=919a296b209176c041eec77ac00394a61389bcca)

The battle of Port Lynch was over and ended in a Decisive Saderan victory. However, while the battle of Port Lynch was raging at the same time the second Naval battle of the war began.

The 16 Ships under Admiral Grau's second in command had caught up to the 3 corvettes and the 5 Transport ships fleeing the battle starting the battle of Cape Wonnoa. 

While outclassed and outnumbered the Alliance corvettes had 2 advantages over the Saderan ships. They were fasted and they could go in shallow water.

Captain Carlos Camell of the Tempest led his small fleet as close to the cost as possible while covering the transport vessels by unleashing salvos of Ballista bolts from the corvettes.

Grau's second in command attempted and failed to sink the tempest as every time it got into ramming distant the smaller ship was easily outmaneuvered it. This game of cat an mouse continued until the tides turned as the overconfident Sadera fleet fell right into Carlos's plan.

By the time the Sadera's realizes it, it was to late. 8 of the 16 Sadera ships including the Glory Crashed into the underwater costal rocks shattering the bottom of their hulls leading to extensive damage. 

With half the Saderan fleet stuck in the submerged rocks and sinking the tempest and the 2 other corvettes turned around and opened fired a full broad side at the Stuck and sinking Saderan ships. The Saderan ships that were still in safe waters could do nothing but watch from a distance as the Corvettes slowly picked off their comrades one by one unable to intervene out of fear of meeting the same fate. 

Seeing the emerging slaughter in an unexpected act Vice Admiral Garvus hosted a white flag surrendering his Emperor Class ship the Glory to Captain Carlos Camell of the tempest.

The Tempest and the other 2 corvettes stopped their attacks on the other stuck ships and accepted the surrender taking the entire crew of the glory prisoner before leaving with the Transports ending the battle in a humiliating Saderan defeat.

  
As night fell the two battles of Port Lynch and Cape Wannoa ended. The Saderans had won a strategic victory at Port Lynch while the Alliance a tactical victory at cape Wannoa. 

At the battle of port Lynch 456 Alliance sailors were killed and 1 ship sunk and 3 Damaged. Most of the dead coming from the Esmerald while the Saderans lost 578 sailors killed, 5 ships sunk, and 6 ships Damaged.

At Cape Wannoa the Saderans lost 389 sailors killed and 4 ships sunk and 5 damaged while the alliance only had 1 ship damaged and 23 Sailors killed. 

The actions on April the 3rd ended overall in a Strategic Saderan victory as the victory at Cape Wannoa didn't have a major effect on Saderan naval plans and any plans for extending the Alliance blockade past port lynch were destroyed. The Alliance however won a tactical victory on the actions of April the 3rd sinking more ships than Sadera at the cost of 1 Man of war Class ship the Esmerald sunk and 1 Admiral killed. Aurthor Prat would be the highest-Ranking Alliance personnel to be killed over the course of the war.

The battle of port lynch would launch Admiral Grau into stardom as he would begin his journey to become Sadera's best naval commander in history. The battle of Cape Wannoa's on the other part while it didn't undermine Saderan naval efforts in any way proved to be a public humiliation as 16 Galley's were defeated by just 3 small Corvettes. Vice Admiral Garvus would have been executed if he hadn't been captured during the battle for his failure. Meanwhile Captain Carlos Camell of the Tempest would arrive to a hero's welcome back in Alliance territory and would be promoted to Admiral due to his successful victory against Sadera and would replace the now dead Aurthor Prat as commander of the Avion sea fleet. Admiral Grau on his part would state the fault of the defeat at cape Wannoa was not on Garvus fault but rather the inexperience of the Saderan sailors and slave labor who had never seen any real naval combat. 

The Sacrifice of Aurthor Prat and the Esmerald at the battle of port Lynch would become forever engraved in the history of Falmart and the alliance as Aurthor Prat would become a national hero for his selfless efforts to save his fleet and fight to the end against a numerically superior enemy.

This will also be how I predict the game will start.

So I just got the game and started it for the first time. Bit of context; Jason WAS a cop, and got kicked out of the force for some reason. Now he is a junkie struggling to pay back his debts. Lucia is some kind of gangster / mercenary. They were previously together but are kinda just friends for now.

So the game starts with Lucia going to check up on Jason because she heard about him and his situation from someone in her circle. The game gives you control just outside of his house, so I took a look around in the small area I could. It was kinda like Franklin’s first house in a hood-like neighborhood. I admired the tall buildings in the distance and could kinda see the ocean. Side note, I found a drinking fountain and I was able to use it, and a hydration meeter appeared (hydration gameplay confirmed).

When you walk up to the house a cutscene starts. You go in, and Jason is sitting in the kitchen tweaking out. He panics, thinking you are someone here to get their money he owes. He pulls a gun on you, but Lucia calms him down and he recognizes you. They talk for a bit and catch up. After Jason explains his situation, Lucia decides to help him out. 

Lucia gets a tip from someone of a high payout job, although very risky. You go to this place, a fancy office building I think, and you need to break in and steal a specific high value item (it was a weird golden Buddhist statue. Idk, weird dream). There was very little resistance but you do kill a few guards along the way to learn some mechanics (real stealth gameplay and badass takedowns confirmed). When you go to make your escape, your car doesn’t start. Someone sneaks up on you and bashes the but of their rifle through the window, knocking you out.

When you wake up, you are cuffed in a chair, and so is Jason. Apparently the guy you stole from was the guy Jason owed money too. So now you’re both in the shit. He gets very angry and says he’s going to kill you both. He gets a phone call and leaves the room. Jason, with his previous law enforcement skills. Is able to get out of the cuffs, and help Lucia too. You fight the guards and steal their guns and shoot your way out of the warehouse they had you in. You steal a car and get away.

As you are driving, Lucia and Jason have a conversation on what went down, and how fucked they are. But they decide they are in it together, and there is only one way they’ll be able to survive, trust.

Pouring himself another glass of wine Jonos took a seat in an old leather seat he'd had hauled from Hearts Home for him, it was one of the few comforts of home he'd allowed himself on the campaign trail. *I deserve it* he thought to himself *after all I've done for this family, all I've lost.*


Another glass of wine. The pain in his skull was growing again, throbbing against his brain, dull aches mixed with strange shooting pains that spread through his entire body like spiders web. *Malignant growths* the maesters had called it, strange foreign bodies eating at the inside of his mind. They knew about them from dissecting corpses, cutting open men who'd complained of similar maladies and discovering strange growths inside. If they had been inside his arms or legs they could have just hacked them off at the base and called it a day but these ones grew inside of his skull, as was his luck.


They'd told him two years, that had been nearly a decade ago. It had given his work a sense of urgency, it had been why he'd sent Artys off to Aenar, *gods that was foolish.* The stepstones had been a step in the right direction for the boy, he needed to become a killer and the schoolyard cruelty Jonos had taught him wouldn't be enough. Jaime had salvaged that misstep though, his letters discussing Artys’ temperament had been crucial in stopping the boy from becoming just another summer knight of the capital.


Thinking of that brought a small smile to Jonos' lips, Jaime was a fool, as fickle and prone to outbursts as Artys though with none of his callousness. Being so instrumental in his father's plans weighed on him immensely, a fact that brought Jonos ceaseless amusement.


Jonos’ firstborn may have inherited his father's talent for deception but he had none of the ambition that made it worthwhile. He was like a dull knife, a rounded spear, a practice sword. It was embarrassing, embarrassing for him, embarrassing for Jonos. There had been a time when he thought that his son might be able to take up his mantle, to guide house Corbray to new heights from the shadows as Jonos had for most of his adult life but as the boy had grown older it had become apparent he lacked the stomach for it.


*SNAP*


A sudden noise grabbed Jonos’ attention from his drunken monologue. Something was off, something was wrong but in his drunken haze he couldn't quite place his finger on what…


It was the silence. Even with the levies off slaughtering the Manderlys he should have still been able to hear servants running around the camp, hear his guards idle chatter. All he could hear now was the distant shouting of soldiers in the city and the sound of the ocean wind against the walls of his tent.


*Where were his guards?*


Something was definitely not right, panic began to fill the old man as he stumbled to his feet snatching an old cheese knife from his table and hid it in his coat. At first he tried to stand and appear imposing but the liquor in his stomach began to make his head swim horribly so he was forced back to his seat, instead doing his best to look disinterest in the goings on around him.


*Jonos Corbray was terrified.*"
"Parents who throw their kids in water to “teach” them to swim, please stop doing that",stories,1i9wwqx,2025-01-25 16:00:06,10,0.81,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i9wwqx/parents_who_throw_their_kids_in_water_to_teach/,AngelWithAPencil,Venting,"During the summer I was in a public pool. This specific pool has a small section for kids that are just starting off swimming. I’m not entirely sure but I think this pool doesn’t allow floaties and other things to help you stay on the surface. They only allow goggles. So if you have kids, you’d bring them to that one kiddie section.

However being a public pool in a city, it gets very cramped very fast so some parents will hold their children as they go deeper in the pool. Which is allowed. However I see a father walking on the side of the pool holding his son who appears to be fighting him. Next thing I know, he tosses this poor kid into 7 feet water. No floaties. He looked no older than 6. Of course, the kid could not stay afloat and began to panic. Bystanders grabbed him to keep him afloat. Fortunately the lifeguards reacted very fast and got him out. The father was arrested and the child’s mother picked him up. 

I understand that it’s good to teach your child important life lessons at a young age and swimming is certainly one of those lessons in my opinion. Every child should learn how to swim. But putting them in a situation like that is the worst way to do it. You’re not in a movie. This is real life, and your child can die. And then you’ll be charged with manslaughter. 

Teach them step by step. Start out in shallow water. Just because it’s a pool doesn’t make it any less dangerous than an ocean. Don’t traumatize your children by putting them in danger. "

**Chapter 10: Blazing spear:**

As Kosma walked back to the courtyard, Jed saw a marker appear on one of the gunships,

 

""Hey Kosma... looks like you get to ride in that thing, sure beats walking!"" her face lit up as Jed said that. Kosma started to run excitedly towards the plane when she felt something pulling at her backpack.

 

""NO, YOU DON'T!"" said Kalax as Kosma stared back at him, flicking her ears back and giving the captain a glare.

 

""It's so damn cute when you do that..."", Jed admitted, which only made Kosma angrier,

 

""Shut up!"" she squirmed in Kalax's iron grip as he finally let go, causing Kosma to fall to the ground with a loud thud. It took restraint, but Jed made no comment.

 

""The enemy has set up anti-aircraft batteries around the pulse cannon, we have already lost three of our dropships to them,"" Kalax explained as he displayed a holographic map from a projector on his shoulder while the troopers gathered around it. There was a heavy anti-aircraft battery protected by small armor at each corner of the cannon's platform. Kalax pointed to a large road that rose above the jungle, connecting the control center to the position of the anti-orbital gun.

 

""We'll take this logistics highway all the way to their position, but if our scouts are right, we should expect very heavy resistance. We only need to take out one of those batteries and our transports can land... AM I CLEAR TROOPERS!"" the troopers quickly replied with a resounding ""YES SIR!"", with a metallic ""clank"" as their left hand slammed against their chest as they performed the Indaran salute.  Horror washed over Kosma's face at the thought of having to walk all the way to the pulse cannon, and Kalax only confirmed that the path would be littered with enemies. It would be a long slog.

 

""If you want, we can stop here. Doesn't look like any enemies are coming,"" Jed said, seeing how beaten Kosma looked,

 

""No, let's just do this... it would be incredibly annoying to try to sleep with the warzone atmosphere all around, I mean, blow up the enemy mothership with the cannon and we win, right?"" she asked with a nervous smile.

 

""I really hope this is the end of the level, this seems like a fun place to stay... you know, when there aren't murder-bots everywhere..."", Jed replied as Kosma nodded in agreement.

Kosma followed the group as the troopers chatted among themselves. They might only be simple AIs, but the fact that they were robots made it ironically a little easier for Kosma to pretend they were real. As they walked past a cargo bay full of containers and automated vehicles sitting idle at their stations. Kosma ran quickly to try to activate one of them, but to no avail,

""COME ON!... I really don't want to slog through this on foot. Jed, does a prompt appear to interact with any of these?"" asked Kosma as she hooked a cable from her wrist terminal into one of the trucks and randomly tapped things on the interface.

 

""At least you have the robots with you... what's left of them,"" Jed replied with a hint of sadness as Kosma resigned herself to walking to the enemy position. As the huge sliding doors leading to the highway opened with a loud hydraulic hiss, Kalax turned to look at Kosma,

 

""Trailblazer, I have some very distressing news,"" his tone was incredibly dark and made her fear what information he was about to give her,

 

""Y...yes?"" she asked out of pure reflex, though she knew he would continue his dialog anyway,

 

""I know how much it meant to you to walk over 8000 meters of bridge, but I ordered APCs to carry us as it will be safer,"" the Captain explained ironically, Kosma tilted her head to the side as she imagined the non-existent mocking grin on his mouthless face. His eyes, however, managed to express the joking tone as he pointed at a pair of incoming Sadurian defense force transports,

 

""Son of a..."" Kosma exclaimed, her face lighting up as she watched the transports descend before them, dropping a pair of six-wheeled APCs before flying away. The boxy vehicles were covered in angular armor, the logo of the 118th Battalion stamped on the side next to the vehicles' serial numbers. As the doors opened, she noticed that the transports had room for a gunner, a driver, and eight passengers.

They could see the battle raging throughout the facility, with the defense turrets on the control building shooting down enemy dropships and squadrons of defense drones fighting some kind of enemy equivalent. Still hopelessly outnumbered, the defenses would at least hold the line until they shot down the mothership. Deep down, however, Kosma and Jed knew that the battle was nothing more than a skybox, albeit a convincing one.

The APCs had been delivered with just enough troops to fill every seat, including hers and Kalax's. He turned to Kosma and pointed to the vehicle on the left,

""Get on the turret of the rampart,"" the captain ordered as Kosma boarded the vehicle, relief washing over her. She knew they would have to fight through a bunch of enemies to get to the other side, but at least it would not necessarily be easier. The rampart APCs would make it faster, especially if she didn't have to drive. The interior was a bit cramped, but that was to be expected from a military transport, Kosma was just glad to have a comfortable padded seat.

The moment she got into the vehicle, the camera zoomed in as Kosma got into the gunner's seat and stared at the controls, unsure what to do, when a popup appeared with the controls for Jed.

 

""Uhhh... yeah, because of course I can operate military hardware without training..."" as she spoke, Jed tested the controls, her hands automatically reaching for a joystick at her side and pressing a button that lowered a screen showing a camera view of the turret.

 

""It says... I can transform the weapon?"" Jed said a little confused as he pressed the middle mouse button. The APC's weapon rotated, transforming into something shorter but wider as Jed fired a large burst of blue energy bolts at it, which spread out in a cone pattern. Switching back to its original mode, the barrel lengthened and the weapon's struts retracted, making it appear thinner as ventilation slits opened on the sides. This mode fired a concentrated burst of energy, presumably designed to take out armored targets, while the other mode was designed to hit groups of smaller enemies.

 

""Now that's weird..."" said Jed, switching between modes, firing at lampposts and inactive driverless vehicles to test the weapon.

 

""Jed... get your hands off that keyboard. I always wanted to fire one of those things!"", Kosma excitedly fired the weapon, riddling a nearby car with holes from the dispersal mode, then firing a concentrated blast at the engine, causing it to erupt in a fiery explosion,

 

""YESSSH!"" Kosma exclaimed with a sadistic grin, feeling like she could take on anything with this turret,

 

""Hey psycho, when you are ready to go give the word,"" Jed playfully replied, making Kosma frown, she tried to look at the camera but could feel it was somehow outside the vehicle.

 

""Well, let's go... I want to see what this thing does to the robots!"" she made the turret face forward as Jed pressed the interaction button to close the tutorial popup. Shortly thereafter, a female robot voice exclaimed

 

""Next stop, anti-orbital cannon!"", the transports began to move forward, side by side. The APC was driven by a slightly smaller and thinner trooper with a less angular design and a vaguely feminine shape.

 

""What the hell? Who's driving?"" asked Jed, slightly confused.

 

""Another trooper?"" Kosma replied as she moved the turret from side to side, scanning for enemies.

 

""Why would they make female and male robots?"" wondered Jed aloud.

 

""Originally they all had the same voice, but the support troopers were made smaller and with lighter armor to fit better on vehicles and be more mobile, the soldiers kept calling them female troopers soo... on the next versions they just gave them a girly voice, pretty silly if you ask me,"" she explained while trying to adjust the turret seat to a comfortable position.

 

""It probably helps morale, she sounds kind of cute!"" said Jed, oblivious to the jealous look Kosma shot at the driver.

 

""JED! ARE YOU HORNY FOR A PIECE OF MILITARY HARDWARE?"" yelled Kosma as she poked her head out of the turret hatch.

 

""I just said she looks cute, I can't even see what she looks like from this angle... Get back inside, I see something approaching!"", Kosma grumbled as she got back inside and closed the hatch. Seeing that a group of heavy walkers and spider-bots had set up a roadblock, she quickly opened fire, Kalax's transports following shortly after.

 

""DON'T CHANGE SUBJECT ON ME, BOY!"" a very jealous Kosma shouted as she blasted the roadblock with the turret.

 

""Can we discuss this when we're not in combat!"", Jed replied, starting to raise his voice, he didn't want Kosma to get killed over such a stupid argument.

 

 ""Relax, this thing is bolt-proof, ironically it feels like playing a video game. I'm not really mad,"" she said in a cheerful tone, easing Jed's worries, although she was a bit jealous of this driver-trooper.

 

They spread out easily to take care of groups of small robots, adjusting their spread pattern based on the distance to the targets. Sending shards of metal everywhere as their power cores exploded violently on impact. One of the heavy walkers locked its weapons on Kosma's APC, firing large bolts of energy into the armor. The attack shook the transport, nearly knocking Kosma out of her seat and making her regret that she hadn't used her seatbelt, something she quickly set about correcting. However, the attack only managed to dent the plating and take a small portion of the vehicle's health bar.

She fired back using the turret's armor piercing mode, which didn't seem to be very effective against the machine's thick front plating, sending sparks and a burst of plasma on impact as the bolts dissipated against it.

 

""Aim for its ocular sensor to stun it, if you have bad aim, shoot for the legs,"" the captain advised over the comms as Kosma struggled to aim the weapon while taking enemy fire.

 

""Need help?"", Jed offered.

 

""No, no... otherwise I'll never learn"", after a few seconds of fiddling with the control joystick she managed to blow three legs off the walker, causing it to collapse to the ground and burst into flames shortly after.

 

""NICE SHOT!"" Jed and Kalax shouted simultaneously, making Kosma dizzy.

 

A Sadurian gunship, followed by a pair of enemy fighter drones, began to fly parallel to the transports,

 

""Get these things off me, sir!"" the pilot yelled over the comms as Kosma turned the turret and began guiding the targets and peppering them with disperse mode.

 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING P-26!? YOU ARE APPROACHING AN ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY!"" By the time the pilot heard Kalax's warning, it was too late as a missile hit the gunship in one of its engines. It spun out of control as it barreled toward the bridge, Kosma's APC narrowly avoiding it. The gunship's fuel tank exploded as it hit the pavement.

""Damn... no survivors, don't stop,"" Kalax said in his usual stern voice as the drones turned their attention to the transports and began to follow them.

The drones fired salvos of rockets at the APCs as Kosma swung the turret to face them. She heard one of the missiles explode right next to the vehicle, causing it to lurch sideways as the suspension did its best to absorb the shock.

 

""AAAHHH!"" Kosma exclaimed as the jolt made her head hit the screen hard, shattering the glass. Had she not been wearing her helmet, she probably would have broken her nose. At least the screen was still working.

She alternated between intercepting the missiles and firing at the drones themselves, with Jed helping her aim. One of the drones crashed into the jungle as she managed to inflict critical damage, while the other rammed in front of the transports and into a truck loaded with energy cells, causing it to explode in an azure blast of energy and electric arcs that temporarily disrupted the vehicles' electronics. The drivers stopped immediately,

 

""DAMN IT!"" yelled Kalax as he stared at the massive gap created by the explosion, as a voice came over a nearby PA speaker as a security camera stared at the APCs,

 

""I would appreciate it if you would stop damaging my facility more than the invaders! However, I know a way you can cross, let me angle the solar panels,"" the voice belonged to the Indaran technician monitoring their progress from the control facility. Soon gaps opened in the ground at the sides of the road and large photovoltaic panels appeared, angled toward the transports with one side raised toward the abyss.

 

""Do they want us to..."" said Kosma in a worried voice, noticing that the solar panels were wide enough to fit the entire APC,

 

""YOU HEARD THE MAN! PUNCH IT!"" shouted Kalax in a commanding voice, but the vehicles didn't move an inch. Meanwhile, Kosma saw more enemy drones approaching from the front and prepared herself,

 

""Sir... are you suffering from suicidal impulses?"" the driver of the captain's APC replied in a condescending tone.

 

""KOSMA! GET YOUR TROOPER OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND TAKE OVER!"", Kalax yelled as she heard shifting noises and troopers complaining over the comms,

 

""SIR! SEEK A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??!"", Kosma heard the driver protest as she got out of the turret seat and made her way to her driver,

 

""Uhh... can you please go to the turret?... why am I even talking to this thing..."" she said, staring at the round face of her driver, when to her surprise the trooper answered, mainly thanks to Jed pressing the ""change seat"" button prompt,

 

""Ooo, I get to shoot the bad guys now!"" the trooper exclaimed excitedly as she got to the turret. Meanwhile, Kalax was having trouble with his own driver,

""Hey Trailblazer, just for the record, I would never hit a real woman,"" Kalax said over the comms before she heard a loud ""CLANG"" as the captain promptly slapped the trooper to take her place. Kosma could hear Jed laughing audibly over her head,

""ALLRIGHT, YOU TAKE THE LEFT, I TAKE THE RIGHT!"" Kalax ordered as his APC barreled towards one of the solar panels, Kosma staring at the wheels and pedals a bit confused,

 

""Jed... do you mind? It's been a long time since I've driven anything with wheels..."" the nervousness in her voice was palpable as the enemy drones were already firing missiles at her vehicle. Fortunately, the soldier on the turret was doing a good job of intercepting most of them,

 

""Absolutely!"" said Jed after a quick glance at the popup for the driving controls before accelerating towards the improvised ramp,

 

""CAPTAIN YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER I'VE SERVED WITH!"" shouted Kalax's former driver as her APC flew over the cap, Kosma's soon to follow. She felt the suspension bounce violently on contact with the ground as Jed lost control of the vehicle and veered toward a gap in the bridge's walls.

She screamed in terror as the transport plunged into the jungle below, Jed watching in horror as the APC crashed into some jagged rocks. For a few seconds, the camera hovered over the wrecked vehicle, the last checkpoint loaded as she was about to jump the gap,

 

""Kosma... I..."", Jed said as Kosma was about to tear off the steering wheel from the sheer stress of hyperventilating,

 

""I know Jed, I know,"" Kosma said with a deep, long sigh, ""No matter how many times it happens, it's still horrible... let's... LET'S DO THIS!"" she exclaimed, trying to keep her brave face on. She knew Jed understood her pain and stress, but it was something she mostly did to trick herself into moving forward without having constant breakdowns.

 

""Are you sure you want me to drive?"" asked Jed hesitantly as a missile hit the back of the APC, knocking Kosma to the ground,

 

""YES, YOU IDIOT!"" she shouted as Jed regained control and heard Kala's ex-driver repeat her voice line as her vehicle jumped with him following through the left solar panel. This time he made the jump, this time maintaining control of the vehicle as they barreled down the highway. Dodging enemy attacks as the trooper in the gunner's seat did her best to keep enemy drones off their tail.

 

While Jed hadn't exactly kept the APC intact, it was still running, and Kosma herself remained in one piece. They were almost at the anti-orbital cannon. A gigantic piece of artillery with a rectangular barrel the size of a skyscraper, secured by three pairs of struts along its length. It stood on a square pyramid-like base surrounded by fortifications that had been taken over by the enemy.

Kosma saw a pair of vanguard units at the base of the pyramid's access ramp. Their gunner was busy targeting something behind them, so Jed simply accelerated toward one of them. As was probably scripted, Kalax ran for the other, and the vanguard eliminators were crushed under the weight of the armored vehicles,

""WOOOHOOOOO!!! That was cathartic, this thing is unstoppable!"" shouted Kosma as she felt the last pair of wheels crush the robot,

 

""You... really don't want to know how much health we have left..."", Jed said with a hint of concern in his voice as he stopped abruptly in front of a row of pylons along their path,

 

""EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE TRANSPOT, WE MUST FOLLOW ON FOOT!"", Kalax shouted as the troopers started to get out of both vehicles. Reluctantly, Kosma got out of the driver's seat as she stared in shock at the sorry state of her APC. The few pieces of armor that hadn't fallen off were riddled with holes and dents, blackened from the fire and explosions, one of the rear wheels was missing entirely, and the headlights had been shot out. On the other hand, Kala's vehicle was spotless, as if it had just rolled off the assembly line,

 

""JED YOU ARE A HORRIBLE DRIVER!"" exclaimed Kosma as she pointed with both hands at her barely functioning ride,

 

""Unlike us, his was probably indestructible... I got us here in one piece, didn't I?"" replied Jed,

 

""That's... technically correct, when you rammed a rock through the cabin, I was only crushed by it, but not split in half,"" Kosma replied cynically,

 

""Please don't joke about such things,"" Jed replied in a hurt voice, feeling extremely guilty about the accident,

 

""Look, it's either cynical humor or crying... these batteries aren't going to blow themselves up, let's just get this damn level over with... I need a very long shower,"" Kosma said, trying to summon up the courage for the coming battle, as one of the Troopers pointed to something in the sky,

 

""INCOMING!"" he shouted as Jed saw red bullet-shaped symbols appear below them, causing Kosma to immediately move out of the way while Kalax pushed one of his troopers out of one of the circles. A single large shell split into a few dozen fragments mid-flight, landing exactly where the circles had predicted, blowing up the APCs and taking out a couple of troopers,

 

""YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE AND DESTROYED MY VEHICLE! YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER EVER!"" one of the drivers yelled at Kalax as he ran for cover,

 

""HAD I LET YOU KEEP DRIVING WE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, NOW SHUT UP AND RUN TROOPER!"", Kalax replied,

 

""Can you see the icons too?"" asked Jed as Kosma froze in shock after a grenade exploded a few meters away from her,

 

""WHAT ICONS!?"" she yelled in confusion,

 

""The game will tell me where the shells will land, just give me full control, even if I make you stand still, okay?"" said Jed as he saw another set of circles appear, causing her to move slightly to the side. Kosma saw the grenades explode around her again, only a few meters away from turning her into red mist,

 

""Okay... that's not scary at all..."", Kosma said with a nervous laugh as Jed pushed her forward.

 

""Ma'am, I just wanted to let you know that I do not blame you for losing my vehicle..."", Kosma's former driver said in the sleepiest voice her voice modulator could produce. Kosma completely ignored her, having other priorities at the moment.

 

At the top of the pyramid, around the massive rotating base of the anti-orbital gun, the enemy had placed AA batteries at the four corners of the structure. The anti-aircraft weapons were large three-legged machines that bore a resemblance to heavy walkers, except they replaced the heavy repeating blasters with an array of missile tubes that fired at incoming security drones from the facility. Protected by dozens of spider-bots, the Heavy Walkers' vanguard units and battle drones, along with transports flying overhead, made Kosma wish she had stayed in the underwater facility.

Running from cover to cover, dodging mortar rounds, Kosma already felt defeated and braced herself for another long series of deaths,

 

""Jed... do you have a plan? because I doubt 16 troopers are going to do much against all of... THAT!"" she exclaimed as Jed made her dodge an incoming burst of enemy fire from a walker that took out a trooper behind her, ""15 troopers..."" she said amidst panting,

 

""I have a plan, but you won't like it, you've played your share of video games, right?"" asked Jed, struggling to concentrate on dodging the grenades and the conversation at the same time,

 

""Yeah..."" she nodded confused,

 

""You know when you get frustrated from dying too often and just run past the enemies to complete the objective?"" he asked as Kosma took a split second to give him an incredulous look,

 

""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DESTROY THE AA BATTERIES WITHOUT GETTING ANNIHILATED BY EVERYTHING IN THE SURROUNDING!"" she shouted as a piece of shrapnel clipped one of the tips of her tail, making her squeal,

 

""Those mortars are relentlessly targeting you, and if you don't stop to attack something and spam your dodge move, we can just trick them into bombing their own robots!"" shouted Jed as a stray shot hit Kosma in the chest, her armor managing to absorb most of the impact,

 

""Ouch... good, now focus!"" said Kosma, crushing her last vial of regen-gel and shaking her head at how rude that came out, ""I mean it sounds like a decent plan, but enough chatter... let's do this! 

 

With her thruster-assisted dodge and rocket boots, she quickly outpaced Kalax and the troopers. Running into the middle of the enemy formation, Jed had them running in circles for a moment that felt like an eternity to Kosma as energy bolts came at her from all directions. Once she was surrounded, Jed waited for the markers of the next mortar strike and let her boost jump out of the way, the explosions from the barrage pushing her further.

She landed awkwardly, belly up, with burning robot parts raining all around her. She used her back-mounted thrusters to immediately get back up and continue her mad dash for the AA tripod,

 

""JED, I HATE YOU SO MUCH!"" she shouted as she parried a blow from a vanguard unit's blade before lunging backwards to see it torn apart by a blast from a heavy walker meant for her. She threw herself into the air again, and in a clearing in the jungle below, she caught a glimpse of the machine responsible for the mortars. Like its AA cousin, it was clearly based on the Heavy Walker, but thicker to support the weight of its massive armament. It had ground anchors that pinned it to the ground, presumably to keep it from tipping over from the recoil of firing the weapon.

 

""TRUST THE PROCESS!"" he replied, letting her slide right under the AA battery as the enemies swarmed around her. She heard the mortar fire and, sword in hand, dashed out from under the tripod. Skewering a spider-bot through its optical sensor, and fueled by adrenaline, she lifted the blade with the inert robot still impaled. She planted one foot on the ground and used the thrusters on her other boot to spin herself. Kosma gained enough momentum to slam the spider-bot into a vanguard eliminator, completely destroying its upper body along with her blade.

 

""KOSMA, THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING I'VE SEEN YOU DO!"" cheered Jed as he carried her out of the blast zone. She couldn't help but look back at the clustered group of enemies before the cluster shell rained death upon them.  The charge from the mortar rounds combined with the rockets in the tubes of the AA battery to create an explosion so massive that the reflective visor of Kosma's suit lowered to protect her eyes,

 

""Yep, that's what I was going for,"" Kosma bluffed, not wanting to admit that her blade had gotten stuck in the spider-bot's eye and she was shaking it because she couldn't get it out, the same went for her missile boot, which accidentally went off and sent her spinning out of control. And Jed pretended to believe her.

 

""STELLAR JOB KOSMA!"" she heard Kalax say over the radio,

 

As she set off to clear the remaining enemies from the position, the troopers had already caught up to her and opened fire on a group of spiders as they rushed the position,

 

""I WANT THAT ARTILLERY PIECE CLEARED FROM THE FACE OF IRUX!"" the captain ordered, putting a pair of fingers to the side of his head as he took cover from an incoming mortar barrage. Soon after, a gunship fired a volley of missiles at the mortar-bot, causing it to explode in a blast that knocked down the surrounding trees with its shockwave.

A large group of gunships and air transports, escorted by security drones, approached. They unleashed a dizzying amount of bolt fire and missiles, utterly destroying the few enemy aircraft patrolling the area. Kosma felt relief wash over her as the small fleet landed around them,

 

""Cavalry's here, Captain!"" a female soldier's voice, probably the pilot of one of the transports, exclaimed excitedly as a platoon of robot soldiers disembarked from the dropships. As the transports unloaded two heavy tanks, the ground shook as they separated from the aircraft,

 

""85 TONS OF NAROKAN ENGINEERING WITH A MINIATURIZED INDARAN PULSE CANNON!"" said Kalax, his fists on his hips, staring proudly at the armored behemoths. Then he wrapped his arms around the shoulders of the troopers originally assigned to drive their APCS,

 

""Ladies, we weren't able to assign drivers to the bulwarks, so I guess it's you,"" he explained as the troopers' faces literally lit up, before giving the captain an Indaran salute and rushing to the tanks' hatches,

 

""I went out of my way to order them without drivers, I know how those things get attached to their vehicles... let the troopers know and I will skin you alive and turn you into a fur coat to remind me of my days among the organic..."" the captain said in a somber tone, poking his finger into Kosma's chest plate,

 

""Awwww.... has a sweet spot!"" said Kosma as she brought her palms to her chest,

 

""Hell, I'd have a hot spot for those things too....have you seen her hips!"" she snapped her head at the camera the moment he said that, going so far as to raise the visor on her helmet to make sure he saw her scowl,

 

""If I could reach through the screen, I'd knock those stupid glasses right off your face..."" she muttered angrily,

 

""Kosma... we both know something completely different would happen if you could reach through the screen,"" Jed replied with a grin that Kosma couldn't see but felt in his voice, making her laugh nervously as she lowered the reflective visor so he wouldn't see her blush,

 

A robot with bulkier armor and a distinctive pauldron with the insignia of a planet orbited by two moons, probably indicating his rank as a lieutenant, approached the captain and saluted,

 

""Sir, we'll take it from here!"" the lieutenant shouted before turning to bark orders to his platoon to storm the remaining enemy positions.

 

Kosma saw a pair of engineers enter the pyramidal structure, and Kalax stopped her from following by extending his arm in front of her,

 

""Yes, I know the control room is in there, but if you fire that thing from inside... you won't be able to see the fireworks,"" the captain calmly explained as a broad smile formed on Kosma's face,

""Ohhoho no way.... NO WAY!"" she exclaimed excitedly as the struts along the barrel of the weapon disengaged. The entire structure vibrated as the massive pulse cannon aimed itself at the enemy mothership with a mighty mechanical roar. An amber glow spread through the cannon, emitting a low hum as unfathomable amounts of energy flowed into it, filling the air with static.  The captain looked at Kosma, his face projecting a simplified smiling emoticon hologram as he removed his wrist-mounted terminal,

 

""Say, do you want to do the honors?"" he said in the friendliest tone she'd ever heard him use, while handing Kosma the wrist terminal, which showed the hologram of a large red button,

 

""I DO!"", Kosma grabbed the device and hovered her finger over the button. Climbing onto a wrecked heavy walker to make sure she had the best possible angle, she turned to face the camera and raised the visor,

 

""Hey, I couldn't have done this without you... would you like to do the honors?"" said Kosma as a prompt to press the interaction button flashed on the screen,

 

""No way, you heard the man, he wants you to do it,"" Jed replied, surprised by Kosma's gesture, knowing how much firing powerful weapons meant to her. He couldn't possibly deny her the chance to fire the mother of all directed energy weapons,

 

""We do it at once, when I say fire, we both press it,"" she took a deep breath and looked at the enemy mothership,

 

""THREE, TWO, ONE... FIRE!"" they shouted as she placed her finger on the button while Jed placed his on the interaction button. Rings of energy shot from the cannon's body as a sphere of pure energy formed at its tip for a second before unleashing its power. A golden beam of concentrated pulse energy shot from the mighty weapon as it tore through the skies of Irux at the speed of light. Causing a cataclysmic explosion of amber light that split the enemy ship in half and sent it plummeting to the oceans below.

The shockwave from the explosion took a few seconds to reach the island, shaking the leaves of every tree in the jungle and causing Kosma's ears to flap in the wind as she removed her helmet,

 

""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,"" Kosma cheered alongside the troopers as the enemy units began to shut down after losing the control signal from the battleship. While the vanguard eliminators were independent enough to function without the control signal, they had no choice but to surrender as they were outnumbered and outgunned by the Sadurian defense forces.

 

She took the liberty of stealing a working blade from one of the captured vanguard units and scavenging for some regen-gel to heal her tail before hopping on a gunship to take her back to the control center,

 

“That… was intense, I don’t know how it looked from the screen but… damn I felt that shockwave go through me”, she said while staring at the tropical landscape from the window of the gunship,

 

“I bet it was way cooler in person, you were incredible back there”, Jed complimented as he sighed in relief that Kosma was finally safe, when her intercom buzzed to life,

 

“Kosma, land on my carrier in orbit, we have to…”, Kalax was cut off as Kosma deactivated her intercom, and simply enjoyed the view as they flew her to the landing pad where she had parked her ship,

 

“Jed, if you don’t mind, I will put off adventures for a few days and relax here… its beautiful, and all to myself”, Kosma said as she gave Jed a tired smile,

 

“Absolutely, it will be nice to put off the madness for a few days… or weeks. Didn’t you say something about stealing food and candles? Maybe we could watch a movie together, I have to show you human science fiction”, said Jed excited about what she would think,

 

""It will be nice not to be torn to pieces for a change... when you get off I will take a looooong shower, raid the cafeteria and tomorrow I will steal a boat and go to the beach!"" she smiled excitedly as she laid out her plan,

 

""Sounds great, see you tomorrow Kosma, sorry about... all those deaths,"" Jed replied in a slightly sad tone as Kosma sat at the edge of the landing pad, just like when they came to the comms array,

 

""I'd still be having a nervous breakdown on Octanor Station if it wasn't for you, goodbye Jed"", Kosma said and waved at him before Jed closed the game and went on with the rest of his day, but not without taking some time to do some drawings of Kosma's journey in his sketchbook.

Kenya the place to visit atleast once in your life,KenyaOfficial,1i9wsma,2025-01-25 15:55:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenyaOfficial/comments/1i9wsma/kenya_the_place_to_visit_atleast_once_in_your_life/,OnlineCashDevil,,"I am a caucasian man from young mid age, and i went to kenya a few times and it was lovely. before i traveled to kenya i have been always like a  family man towards my parents since my father was very sick and so i had other duties than myself maybe, my father passed away and some time after that i made plans to come to kenya after i was invited, there i didn't know what to expect from Kenya because i had never been in africa, only seen from Tv and school when i was a kid, i thought about a country with wild animals, villages but woow Kenya is so much more and modern and evoulated.  It is really very beautiful and Nairobi is a big city with many beautiful buildings. It is really very beautiful and Nairobi is a big city with many beautiful buildings and lovely people who call out to you and are happy to see you, you immediately feel welcome as if you were at home.

The food, well that's a feast for the mouth, i enjoyed all the traditional dishes such as ugali, chapati (madondo), sukuma, nyama choma and so much more nice foods the kenyans have for you.

There are so many nice places you can visit, everything is there... Beautiful ocean, beautiful forest and wildlife, or going out and shopping in a few beautiful city's like Nairobi, Mombassa and nakuru for example, there is something to do for everyone and everyone will love kenya!

Kenyans have different tribes, for example the Maasai which you see often and recognize on their traditional clothes, i believe the biggest and most common tribe is kikuyu like the former president from kenya, the offical language which you will hear most is Swahili and next English or different tribe languages.

You should really visit Kenya but you have to understand, visting Kenya is falling in love with Kenya

I love kenya to be honest, definetely kenya count so much people who are so nice and welcoming, I have always loved kenya since i came very first day, would have loved to invest, open a bussines, buy or build a house and settle one day but i think i closed myself out and nobody in kenya takes guilt i am aware that i better don't come back and leave you people live your life without this white man who always complains (doesn't matter if it was with my good reason or not or what hapenned) i gues it's me. I am the problem and i am not that smart and not really grown up yet and i am pathetic, i don't know about life yet i guess. I guess we all have a different story and should understand each other and i appreciate how people understand me even when i am wrong, i will keep my stories for myself in the little ramaining future. So wherever i said something wrong or have tried to share some experiences or where i maybe tried to protect myself and i was wrong to do so, my aplogies for all this. I never meant to say anything bad about Kenya and honestly it won't realy make me happy, i thought i could maybe help but probably i wasn't aware from somethings in this life maybe. So with all this said once again my aplogies, i promise here that kenyans won't have a problem with me again and i think i go nowhere again, i really wish you people all the best in life from the bottom of my heart. Take care Rafikis"

The difference is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computer science most of the specs will go over a typical buyer's head. There's also Nintendo's Blue Ocean Strategy, which is deftly woven into their consolization - their corporate philosophy draws heavily from Satoru Iwata ramblings, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these changes, to realize that it's not just bigger- it says something deep about GAMES. As a consequence people who mix up Switch 1 and Switch 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mario's existencial catchphrase ""Itsa me, Mario,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Alfred Hitchcock's extensive library of cinema epics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Shigeru Miyamoto's genius unfolds itself on their LCD screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Nintendo Switch 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the gamers' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

When (in the narrative) should I start my story?,writing,1i9wnuw,2025-01-25 15:49:23,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1i9wnuw/when_in_the_narrative_should_i_start_my_story/,librarygal22,Advice,"Hey, everybody.

So I am writing a fantasy story about a woman who lives on a planet that banished its wizard population across the ocean and put up a magical barrier to ensure that they would never come back. The woman and her husband live in a steampunk dystopia run by the most powerful empire in the eastern hemisphere and they need to escape because the husband was accused of treason (which he did, but accidentally) and the young woman who ""conspired"" with him was about to be put to death. They eventually escape across the ocean and wind up in the land where the wizards settled, which, compared to their homeland, is pretty rad and utopian but has its own pesky flaws (which would be covered later in the narrative).

Anyway, I'm wondering whether I should start the story at the beginning and recount how they escaped their empire and got across the ocean or if I should start the story when they wake up in this new land (i.e. an ""in media res"" type deal). The latter point of the story is the part that I am most excited to write and it would get the reader to wonder all of these things about the characters and want to keep reading to get these questions answered. I could explain how they escaped from the empire at a later point, maybe in a flashback. But if I were to start it when they wake up in the new land, then I would have to find a way to incorporate the character and setting introductions into it.

What do you guys think?"

# Cost of Living in Bermuda: Is It Affordable for Remote Workers?

Living in Bermuda as a remote worker can feel like a dream come true. With its pink sand beaches, turquoise waters, and year-round sunshine, the island offers a lifestyle that many crave. However, before packing your bags and applying for the **Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa**, it’s essential to understand the cost of living. Is it affordable for remote workers? Let’s break it down.

# Housing: The Biggest Expense

Housing in Bermuda is notoriously expensive. Whether you’re renting or buying, prices are significantly higher than in most countries. A one-bedroom apartment in a central location can cost anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000 per month. If you’re looking for something more spacious or closer to the beach, expect to pay even more. For remote workers, this can be a major consideration, especially if your income isn’t adjusted to match the island’s high costs.

# Tips for Saving on Housing

* Consider sharing accommodations with other digital nomads to split costs.
* Look for rentals in less touristy areas, which are often more affordable.
* Negotiate long-term rental agreements for potential discounts.

# Groceries and Dining Out

Since most goods are imported, groceries in Bermuda can be pricey. A loaf of bread might cost $5, and a gallon of milk could set you back $10. Dining out is equally expensive, with a meal at a mid-range restaurant averaging $30-$50 per person. For remote workers who enjoy cooking at home, shopping at local markets and buying seasonal produce can help reduce costs.

# Budget-Friendly Food Options

* Shop at local markets for fresh, affordable produce.
* Limit dining out to special occasions.
* Cook meals at home to save money and enjoy healthier options.

# Transportation: Getting Around the Island

Bermuda is a small island, but getting around can still add up. Public transportation, including buses and ferries, is reliable and relatively affordable, with monthly passes costing around $70. However, owning a car is expensive due to high import taxes and limited space. Many residents opt for scooters, which are cheaper to maintain and easier to navigate on the island’s narrow roads.

# Transportation Tips for Remote Workers

* Use public transportation to save money and reduce your carbon footprint.
* Consider renting a scooter for short-term stays.
* Walk or bike whenever possible to enjoy the island’s scenic views.

# Utilities and Internet

Utilities, including electricity, water, and internet, are another significant expense. The average monthly cost for utilities in a small apartment can range from $200 to $400. Internet speeds are generally reliable, which is crucial for remote workers. However, plans can be costly, with prices starting at around $100 per month.

# Ways to Lower Utility Costs

* Use energy-efficient appliances to reduce electricity bills.
* Limit air conditioning usage and opt for fans or natural ventilation.
* Bundle internet and phone services for potential discounts.

# Healthcare and Insurance

Healthcare in Bermuda is of high quality but comes at a premium. Expats and digital nomads are required to have health insurance, which can cost several hundred dollars per month. While the island has excellent medical facilities, the cost of care can be steep without proper coverage.

# Healthcare Tips for Remote Workers

* Research international health insurance plans that cover Bermuda.
* Compare plans to find one that fits your budget and needs.
* Take advantage of preventative care to avoid costly medical expenses.

# Entertainment and Leisure

Bermuda offers plenty of activities, from snorkeling and hiking to exploring historic sites. While some activities are free, others, like boat tours or golfing, can be expensive. Remote workers should budget for leisure activities to fully enjoy the island’s offerings without breaking the bank.

# Affordable Ways to Enjoy Bermuda

* Explore public beaches and hiking trails for free outdoor fun.
* Attend local events and festivals, which often have low or no entry fees.
* Take advantage of happy hours and special deals at restaurants and bars.

# Is Bermuda Affordable for Remote Workers?

The answer depends on your income and lifestyle. While the cost of living in Bermuda is high, many remote workers find the island’s beauty and quality of life worth the expense. By budgeting carefully and making smart choices, you can make island living work for you. The **Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa** opens the door to this paradise, but it’s up to you to manage your finances wisely.

Ultimately, Bermuda offers a unique blend of work and play that’s hard to find elsewhere. If you’re ready to embrace the island lifestyle, start planning your budget today to ensure a smooth transition to this tropical haven.

# Exploring Bermuda’s Lifestyle: Beaches, Culture, and Connectivity for Nomads

Imagine waking up to the sound of waves gently crashing against pink sand beaches, stepping outside to feel the warm island breeze, and starting your workday with a view of turquoise waters. This is the reality for digital nomads who choose Bermuda as their temporary home. With its stunning landscapes, vibrant culture, and reliable connectivity, Bermuda offers a unique blend of island living and modern convenience.

Bermuda is more than just a tropical paradise. It’s a place where history and modernity coexist seamlessly. The island’s rich cultural heritage is evident in its colorful architecture, traditional music, and local festivals. As a digital nomad, you’ll have the opportunity to immerse yourself in this vibrant culture while enjoying the perks of a well-connected lifestyle.

# Why Bermuda Stands Out for Digital Nomads

Bermuda’s appeal lies in its ability to offer the best of both worlds. Here’s what makes it a top choice for remote workers:

* **Pristine Beaches:** The island is famous for its pink sand beaches, such as Horseshoe Bay and Elbow Beach. These spots are perfect for unwinding after a productive workday.
* **Cultural Richness:** From the historic town of St. George to the lively Gombeys dancers, Bermuda’s culture is both fascinating and welcoming.
* **Reliable Connectivity:** Bermuda boasts high-speed internet and coworking spaces, ensuring you stay connected and productive.
* **Safety and Stability:** The island is known for its low crime rate and political stability, making it a secure place to live and work.

# Beaches That Inspire

Bermuda’s beaches are unlike any other. The pink sand, created by tiny red organisms in the coral reefs, adds a unique touch to the island’s coastline. Whether you’re looking to relax, swim, or explore, there’s a beach for every mood. Horseshoe Bay is a favorite among locals and visitors alike, offering calm waters and stunning views. For a more secluded experience, head to Warwick Long Bay or Jobson’s Cove.

These beaches aren’t just for leisure—they’re also great places to work. Many digital nomads find inspiration in the natural beauty of the island, often setting up their laptops at beachside cafes or under the shade of a palm tree.

# Immersing Yourself in Bermudian Culture

Bermuda’s culture is a blend of British, African, and Caribbean influences. The island’s history is preserved in its UNESCO World Heritage Site, the town of St. George. Wander through its cobblestone streets, visit the historic forts, and learn about Bermuda’s role in the Atlantic trade routes.

Music and dance are integral parts of Bermudian life. The Gombeys, a traditional dance troupe, perform at festivals and events throughout the year. Their vibrant costumes and rhythmic drumming are a must-see for anyone looking to experience the island’s cultural heartbeat.

# Staying Connected in Paradise

One of the biggest concerns for digital nomads is staying connected. Bermuda addresses this with its robust infrastructure. High-speed internet is widely available, and coworking spaces like The Hub offer a professional environment for remote workers. Many cafes and restaurants also provide free Wi-Fi, making it easy to work from almost anywhere on the island.

For those who prefer a change of scenery, Bermuda’s compact size means you can work from a different location every day. From beachfront cafes to quiet parks, the options are endless.

# Exploring Beyond the Beaches

While the beaches are a major draw, Bermuda has much more to offer. The island is home to lush nature reserves, crystal-clear caves, and world-class golf courses. The Bermuda Railway Trail, a scenic path that spans the island, is perfect for hiking or biking. For history buffs, the Royal Naval Dockyard offers a glimpse into Bermuda’s maritime past.

Foodies will also love Bermuda’s culinary scene. From fresh seafood to traditional dishes like fish chowder and codfish breakfast, the island’s cuisine is a treat for the taste buds. Don’t forget to try the famous Dark ‘n Stormy cocktail, made with Bermuda’s own Gosling’s Black Seal rum.

# Making the Most of Your Stay

To fully enjoy Bermuda as a digital nomad, it’s important to plan ahead. The Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa allows remote workers to live and work on the island for up to a year. This visa is a game-changer for those looking to experience island life without sacrificing their careers.

When it comes to accommodation, options range from luxury resorts to cozy guesthouses. Many digital nomads opt for short-term rentals, which offer flexibility and a home-like feel. Public transportation is reliable, with buses and ferries connecting major areas of the island.

Bermuda’s lifestyle is a perfect blend of relaxation and productivity. Whether you’re working from a beachside cafe or exploring the island’s cultural landmarks, you’ll find that Bermuda offers a unique and inspiring environment for digital nomads. With its stunning beaches, rich culture, and reliable connectivity, it’s no wonder that Bermuda is becoming a top destination for remote workers.

# Conclusion

The Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa offers a unique opportunity to blend work and island life in one of the world’s most stunning destinations. From its straightforward application process to the chance to live and work in a tropical paradise, this visa is designed to make your remote work experience seamless and enjoyable.

There were no atoms, only free baryons and free electrons. Photons were trapped in this cloud because they were unable to move significant distances before being scattered in this plasma. It was a dark and chaotic ""ocean"".

As the Universe expanded, it cooled, until parts reached about 3000K. At these points, the energy was low enough that electrons and protons were able to combine to form atoms -- the first hydrogen -- thus allowing the free movement of light.

This did not happen everywhere in this cloud all at once. Rather it happened in points that grew in spherical pockets. What was once a completely opaque plasma became interspersed with floating, glowing bubbles of transparency ...

   ... an ever expanding Universe of Glowing Glass Beads.

The record of this first Game is recorded in the baryonic acoustic oscillations of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Zhuang complains that, ""All Is Glass Bead Game,"" and I agree, but I acknowledge that this ends words, and only allows Game Play in Silence. But beyond the Silence, this Game Is Always the First -- in every civilization, age, language and culture -- though They call it different things.

Jews and Christians call it Genesis, complete with Ocean separated into Light and Dark. Zhuang and His People of Ea have a story about a Turtle Egg.

I rephrase His question (for He is too stubborn to do it Himself) ...

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (次男)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

“All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.”

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble (ギャンブル, Gyanburu) Fortune (財産, Zaisan) Luck (運, Un) Wish (願い, Negai) Value (価値, Kachi) Increase (増加, Zōka) Probability (確率, Kakuritsu) Jackpot (ジャックポット, Jakkupōtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakutō. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakutō like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Zōka (賭け金の増加, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head. The first card that is created is the Number Ace card, representing duality and balance, As i can absorb energy from every sources, whether it be spiritual energy, reishi particles, or even the force of attacks directed towards me. Each attack absorbed contributes to the creation of a new card. However, to create each subsequent card, I must first either absorb energy which is equal to double the amount of attacks as compared to the previous card, Or i Charge my own Zanpakuto With my own power, Which allows me to cut the full charging time in half. For example, to create the first card the Ace, I must first absorb the amount of energy equal to that of two attacks. To create the second card, I must absorb energy which is equal to the amount of four attacks, and so on. This pattern continues, with each new card requiring double the amount of energy as compared to the previous card.
With the cards allowing me a multitude of abilities, such as the ability to use different card games to my advantage, the ability to Is seal away outside attacks, and even ""cut through"" other attacks. 
Now as more cards are created and exist on the battlefield, My own strength, speed, healing, and defense are enhanced. The presence of the cards acts as a catalyst, amplifying My physical attributes and granting them heightened capabilities, As I am able to draw on them like a battery. This boost is proportional to the number of cards in play.
Additionally, i gain control over the four elements - Water, Earth, Eind, and Fire, By using the power of my Zanpakuto (energy conversion) i can Convert the original energy into elemental energy. With them I can summon and manipulate these elemental forces to launch long-range attacks, create defensive barriers, or further augment My own abilities. The elemental control further adds further to my versatility in battle, allowing for strategic offensive and defensive maneuvers.
It also has one final passive ability which can be initiated at any time and it is called Gisei Dekki (犠牲 デッキ, Sacrificial Deck) it is an ability that when activated absorbs all of the cards belonging to whichever suit chosen and element they are affiliated with, this then transforms the Zanpakuto from its normal State of spiritual energy conversion, into a state which embodies said element.


Supēdo (スペード, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.

When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to Generate a Large flood that churns and spins itself into a Whirlpool which Breaks apart everything in its domain, As it spins, All of the debris caught within turns it muddy and murky , but it continues to spin anyways as everything that collapses into It turns it poisonous and acidic to anything spiritual in nature the healing waters now turned deadly as it in dragged into the depths of the ""oceans floor"".
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu (クラブ部, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo (ダイヤモンド, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble.

Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


Jōkā (ジョーカー, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


—————————(Techniques)—————————


Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te (エレメンタル ルーレット: 運命の手, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called Kādo Genshō Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


—————————(weaknesses)—————————

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (次男)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

“All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.”

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble (ギャンブル, Gyanburu) Fortune (財産, Zaisan) Luck (運, Un) Wish (願い, Negai) Value (価値, Kachi) Increase (増加, Zōka) Probability (確率, Kakuritsu) Jackpot (ジャックポット, Jakkupōtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakutō. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakutō like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Zōka (賭け金の増加, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head. The first card that is created is the Number Ace card, representing duality and balance, As i can absorb energy from every sources, whether it be spiritual energy, reishi particles, or even the force of attacks directed towards me. Each attack absorbed contributes to the creation of a new card. However, to create each subsequent card, I must first either absorb energy which is equal to double the amount of attacks as compared to the previous card, Or i Charge my own Zanpakuto With my own power, Which allows me to cut the full charging time in half. For example, to create the first card the Ace, I must first absorb the amount of energy equal to that of two attacks. To create the second card, I must absorb energy which is equal to the amount of four attacks, and so on. This pattern continues, with each new card requiring double the amount of energy as compared to the previous card.
With the cards allowing me a multitude of abilities, such as the ability to use different card games to my advantage, the ability to Is seal away outside attacks, and even ""cut through"" other attacks. 
Now as more cards are created and exist on the battlefield, My own strength, speed, healing, and defense are enhanced. The presence of the cards acts as a catalyst, amplifying My physical attributes and granting them heightened capabilities, As I am able to draw on them like a battery. This boost is proportional to the number of cards in play.
Additionally, i gain control over the four elements - Water, Earth, Eind, and Fire, By using the power of my Zanpakuto (energy conversion) i can Convert the original energy into elemental energy. With them I can summon and manipulate these elemental forces to launch long-range attacks, create defensive barriers, or further augment My own abilities. The elemental control further adds further to my versatility in battle, allowing for strategic offensive and defensive maneuvers.
It also has one final passive ability which can be initiated at any time and it is called Gisei Dekki (犠牲 デッキ, Sacrificial Deck) it is an ability that when activated absorbs all of the cards belonging to whichever suit chosen and element they are affiliated with, this then transforms the Zanpakuto from its normal State of spiritual energy conversion, into a state which embodies said element.


Supēdo (スペード, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.  


Shinzō (心臓, Heart): Now the hearts cards If have the unique ability to heal My physical body, and are powerful as The Hearts card can create overly powerful water-based attacks and healing waves that wash over allies, cleansing and revitalizing them. strength and healing. 
When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to Generate a Large flood that churns and spins itself into a Whirlpool which Breaks apart everything in its domain, As it spins, All of the debris caught within turns it muddy and murky , but it continues to spin anyways as everything that collapses into It turns it poisonous and acidic to anything spiritual in nature the healing waters now turned deadly as it in dragged into the depths of the ""oceans floor"".
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu (クラブ部, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo (ダイヤモンド, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to shatter and create mountains, control fault lines and the very crust and tectonic plates, cause earthquakes and can then use the broken rock to form and create asteroids, and More. 
Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


Jōkā (ジョーカー, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


—————————(Techniques)—————————


Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te (エレメンタル ルーレット: 運命の手, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called Kādo Genshō Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


—————————(weaknesses)—————————

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

El sector inmobiliario en Panamá está llegando a un punto incierto en cuanto a terrenos para seguir construyendo.,Panama,1i9w5hf,2025-01-25 15:26:36,5,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Panama/comments/1i9w5hf/el_sector_inmobiliario_en_panamá_está_llegando_a/,Top-Bed6440,,"Todos estamos de acuerdo en que la vivienda es una necesidad básica, pero va a llegar el día en que entre Panamá y Chorrera ya no habrá espacio para mas proyectos... al menos que nos quedemos sin áreas verdes como ocurre en otras capitales del mundo; Lima, Perú, por ejemplo, lo que ha traido sequía, enfermedades respiratorias por exceso de polvo y hacimiento urbano en dicha ciudad. 

 **¿Cuál es el plan de las inmobiliarias en Panamá a largo o mediano plazo ?**

**Creo sinceramente de que no hay ningún plan, y que los dueños de estas promotoras, que por lo general no son panameños, van a tratar de conseguir la mayor cantidad de permisos posibles, hasta que cesen operaciones y tengan que irse a otros países.**

El problema aquí es que solo tenemos a la ciudad de Panamá como centro comercial con buenos salarios, no somos como otros países (más grandes) que tienen otras ciudades en las que sus habitantes pueden vivir cerca de sus trabajos teniendo una vida cómoda. Además de todo esto, ya no hay lugar en la capital para proyectos de viviendas, al menos que se sigan haciendo proyectos como Ocean Reef (Bahía de Panamá), pero como todos sabemos que en Panamá ese tipo de proyecto es para casas o apartamentos que rondan el millón de dólares, y a simple vista se ve que son las primeras medidas desesperadas del sector inmobiliario por la falta de espacios disponibles para seguir construyendo dentro de la ciudad.

Los proyectos residenciales crecen, pero no al mismo ritmo que la economía fuera de la capital, y cada vez la gente tiene que vivir más lejos de donde trabajan si quieren tener una casa propia.

He is the sweetest little baby and well adjusted to his new life. He is not the bravest, doesn't like when we have guests over, hates the vacuum and tall people but he is getting better.

Since we got him we are having issues with the wind. We live in a windy city not far from the ocean and on the last floor of our building. At the moment there are quit a lot of storms and the wind makes a lot of noise. He is terrified of it. He cries a lot, makes himself the smallest possible (don't know out to express that correctly in English) and pees on the floor out of fear because he doesn't want to move to his litter box. 

He has a lot of hinding spots and we give him a new one in the farest place from the windows when the weather gets bad. We also put an emergency litter box in that safe spot because he won't go to his usual one because of the noise (he won't go near windows when the weather gets too bad, all rooms have windows here ....). We got him a diffuser to try and calm him down. We try to confort him the best we can but it doesn't seem to work.

Is there anything else we can do ? It is his only issue, he is otherwise a happy and healthy litter boy

My Experience Growing and Smoking Granddaddy Purple – Worth the Hype?,indicastrains,1i9voir,2025-01-25 15:05:49,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/indicastrains/comments/1i9voir/my_experience_growing_and_smoking_granddaddy/,Nervous_Passage6093,,"I recently finished my first grow of Granddaddy Purple (GDP), and I wanted to share my experience for anyone thinking about trying it. I’ve heard people rave about it for years, and honestly... it didn’t disappoint! 

**Growing Experience:**

* **Setup:** Indoor, 4x4 tent, 600W LED, soil (Fox Farm Ocean Forest).
* **Flowering Time:** About 9 weeks. It took a little longer than expected, but patience paid off.
* **Growth Pattern:** Super bushy and compact, great for small spaces. Had to defoliate a few times to keep airflow in check.
* **Challenges:** Humidity control was key—those dense buds can trap moisture easily. Ended up running a dehumidifier during late flower.
* **Yield:** Pretty solid! Got around 14 oz from 3 plants, and the buds came out super frosty.

**Smoking Experience:**

* **Appearance:** Deep purple hues with bright orange hairs and a thick coat of trichomes. Absolutely beautiful buds.
* **Smell:** Straight-up *grape candy* with earthy undertones. Opening the jar is like a trip to the candy shop.
* **Effects:** Immediate relaxation, full-body melt, and heavy couch-lock. Definitely a nighttime strain, perfect for unwinding or sleep.
* **Negatives:** Dry mouth was real with this one, and it *will* knock you out if you overdo it.

Overall, GDP totally lived up to the hype. It’s easy to grow with some basic care, and the end result is a super relaxing strain that’s perfect for pain relief and sleep.

Anyone else grown or smoked GDP? How was your experience? Would love to hear tips or tricks for my next run!"

Was This a Real-Time Astral Projection or Just Lucid Dreaming?,AstralProjection,1i9vgxi,2025-01-25 14:56:41,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1i9vgxi/was_this_a_realtime_astral_projection_or_just/,kaitsiecakesss,Was This AP?,"This experience began as a dream in a daycare setting. I was there with my partner Will, and I recall a little girl crying for frozen lemonade. The daycare had a circular window, similar to those seen in aquariums, allowing a view directly into the ocean. Suddenly, I found myself inside the ocean, swimming among sharks and massive, prehistoric creatures. One bird-like creature, which resembled a prehistoric version of an American white ibis, was huge and bit me gently..it didn’t hurt. I had fed ibises in my yard the morning before, so I believe this portion was still part of the dream state.

At some point, I realized I was dreaming and decided to astral project. When I looked up, I saw ethereal beings observing me..powerful, royal-like entities reminiscent of Neptune and other divine figures, along with a lion and a glowing underwater queen. Their presence felt welcoming and godly, as though they were there to guide and acknowledge my intention. They smiled at me as I set my focus to leave the ocean and project.

I felt my body shooting upward, carried by wind and rainbows. I passed through sliding doors, arriving at a space where a woman appeared on an LED screen or behind a desk. I believe I stated my intention to meet my spirit guide.

Next, I found myself in my bedroom, still uncertain if I was dreaming or in the real-time zone. I tried waking Will by slapping and jumping on the bed, but he didn’t react. His eyes eventually opened but stared blankly at me. The scene shifted to my kitchen, where Will appeared alongside my brothers, Zachary (lives in WV) and Austin (lives w me in FL). Austin was riding a small red tricycle and appeared distorted, which I interpreted as how he subconsciously perceives himself. This aligns with Robert Bruce’s teachings in Astral Dynamics about distorted appearances reflecting inner perceptions.

At this point, I noticed my hands melting..a clear sign of an OBE. I began demanding to see my spirit guide. Exiting the house, I arrived in a setting resembling Hopedale, Ohio, where I lived for part of 2nd grade. I moved frequently during my childhood, often staying in schools for only 1–2 years until my freshman year of high school. The hilly landscape and early-morning atmosphere felt symbolic, like the astral was pulling me back to a transitional period of my life. The setting had the vibe of an early morning after a 4th of July event, with people walking as if leaving a gathering.

As I walked, I continued demanding to see my guide. A man resembling Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson in Star Wars 🤓) with glowing purple eyes and a trench coat approached me. His energy was intense and felt powerful, but I was startled and don’t recall if he spoke to me. Upon waking, I realized this was the same man I have seen repeatedly during meditations over the past year..a black man with glowing purple eyes. During those meditations, I didn’t understand who he was at first, but months ago, while doing a card reading on myself, the Archangel Michael card fell out of my deck. The card depicted Archangel Michael as a black man with glowing purple eyes, and I pieced together at the time that he must be connected to Archangel Michael as a spiritual guide.

Now, after this experience, I strongly feel that he may actually be my spirit guide, and that the Archangel Michael card months ago was a way to guide me toward this realization. This experience feels like the final confirmation that he is not just a recurring figure in my meditations but an important presence guiding me spiritually.

I believe the daycare and underwater portions, including the giant ibis, were part of the dream state, while the ethereal beings and the moment I shot up mark the transition into astral projection. I’m trying to determine if I was in the real-time zone or another astral layer when I encountered my guide. This was my third intentional projection, and I’d appreciate insights from experienced projectors.

With never having clicked with CIV V and it looking so much like it, it passed me by. The lukewarm reception of the game didn't convince me to change my mind.

Due to circumstances I've had time on my hand and between having a general sci fi itch and the CIV VII hype I saw that beyond earth was in my family share library and decided to give it a go.

My first couple of attempts left me completely overwhelmed. Until I eventually disabled rising tide DLC and tried again. That game I finished and had a lot of fun but I remembered from my previous attempts that diplomacy was completely different with the DLC. So I started a new game with the DLC. This time it went well and I finished the game winning it at 7 in the morning. 

So here are my key take aways:

The affinity and technology system allows you to be creative in solving problems the game presents you. Much more then other CIV game where you tend to think of your strategy as you are picking your CIV. BE allows you to actually evolve your game as you see fit. The tech tree doesn't function as a gate keeper for just better yields/units. You are encouraged to set out a build for your tech tree like it is an RPG. 

I do wish the affinity system was more removed from tech. Something rising tide does try to address. But it feels a bit weird now with how later games handle culture that that isn't the major driving force behind affinity. 

Another point I really like, and which makes me excited for CIV II, is how all terrain is usable. Albeit sometimes locked behind a building. But the two normally bad tiles, dessert and tundra, both have a building which boost their yields. But in general the tech tree will push you towards more relying on buildings that on tile yields. Which is thematic for a sci fi game where you only got there because you could rely on specialists. Again pushing you to be creative in how you optimise the situation you start in. 

The influence based diplomacy from rising tide is interesting but very much gamey. It does a decent job at trying to balance the fact that you want the player to be able to interact diplomatically with the AI but at the same time the AI is competing against the player. 

Which is a bit of a gripe for me. I wished BE focussed more on colonising and taming the planet then on the classic CIV free for all to the victory objectives. It feels like it rushes through the early game. I would have liked it if the wildlife started off a lot weaker in most places and ramped up as you exploit more of the planet. With then in the late game having a crisis between the affinities.

Also I do not care for oceanic cities. They remove a dimension of the map which I like much more then anything they add. Luckily there is a mod for that.

    


Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

Overall playing BE with some of the info on CIV VII in mind has made me more excited for CIV VII then before. It also makes me wish they would revisit alpha centauri/beyond earth setting but more PvE style."
[New Course] Pa’ani Bay Beach Club,pga2k23,1i9v8z9,2025-01-25 14:46:40,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9v8z9,saucyjay91,New Course,"A labor love (what of these aren’t?) finally released after far too much tinkering and far too close to the release of the new game.

Alas, come relax on the shores of Pa’ani Bay. A par 71 resort course with 3 tees, stretching to nearly 7,400 yards. Don’t get too comfortable, though - missing the fairway requires thoughtful recovery shots.

The front nine plays away from the Golf Suites building, and towards the ocean, where many of the holes play along the inlet or along the beach itself, before returning to the clubhouse. #9 is an island green. 

The back 9 starts with a drivable par-4, before turning back up the hill into the jungle and in the slopes of the ancient volcanoes. The last few holes play down along the main beach-front hotel buildings. The 18th requires an accurate drive if you want to end your round without losing strokes.

Hope you all give it a play and let me know your thoughts!"
💎 3 Hidden Gems Set to Dominate 2025,AllCryptoBets,1i9v8fh,2025-01-25 14:45:55,42,0.96,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i9v8fh/3_hidden_gems_set_to_dominate_2025/,gamer_paradiser,Memecoin,"Hey everyone, Ark here!

The crypto market may be unpredictable, but that’s where some of the best opportunities lie. I’ve been tracking three standout projects - $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE. These projects are building serious momentum and offer unique value propositions for 2025. Here’s why you should keep them on your radar:

# $PLATH (SOL) – Conservation with a Twist

https://preview.redd.it/hoiv3fwrl6fe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f21ca407d2e24cb919017c7b5bb1b8a60ed2f9ab

**$PLATH** is bridging the gap between innovation and impact. Their charitable focus on adopting endangered platypuses (21 and counting) through the WWF sets them apart, while their commitment to environmental stability hints at a broader charity roadmap for 2025.

But it’s not all about giving back - $PLATH has fun, too. Their Telegram and Reddit bots (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?) and upcoming NFTs add a layer of engagement for the community. Combine that with a strong team of diamond-handed whales, constant token burns, top-holder airdrops, and this project has serious long-term potential.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.1M
* **Strengths:** Charitable initiatives, original art, strong community engagement.
* **Targets:** Potential for a 2x-3x short-term, with significant long-term promise.

**Contract Address:** 7wMutxpCdP3GbKaoMWoPVf2sFLCeV7a9ox25v1h2QsTp  
**Telegram:** @ PlathPortal  
**Reddit:** r/ plath\_sol

# $CATBAT (SOL) – The Crypto Space Protector

https://preview.redd.it/lg034ns4m6fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d121c7353831f6c5ad5e7eda7ca63ae1cf7ed003

**$CATBAT** is not just a token; it’s a mission-driven initiative to clean up the crypto space. From developing ScamScout, a tool to help users avoid scams, to offering a unique rugged coin redemption platform, they’re tackling real issues head-on.

Daily token burns, top-holder airdrops, and partnerships with other major projects add to its appeal. Plus, the dev has locked his token supply for a year, building trust and ensuring stability for the community.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.7M
* **Strengths:** Anti-scam tools, daily burns, strong roadmap.
* **Targets:** ATH at 4M, with fast growth as tools roll out.

**Contract Address:** mo7mapMrCsyci5w1td1wgrKPtNeCfjfkKi96DknWi5N  
**Telegram:** @ CATBATPORTAL  
**Reddit:** r/ CATBAT

# $PYRATE (SOL) – Charting New Waters in Crypto

https://preview.redd.it/8qet0zcdm6fe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e1df83aa91dd06066d593f5665b47a25a8b10c0

**$PYRATE** isn’t just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. From a rich storyline featuring characters and comics to a pfp builder web app and ocean-cleaning charity initiatives, this project is all about innovation and engagement.

With over 170K users of its Telegram bot, CEX listings on the way, and paid promotions kicking off soon, $PYRATE is positioning itself for explosive growth. Plus, their focus on community gaming (Minecraft and more) is a fun way to strengthen their loyal crew.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 790K
* **Strengths:** Expanding ecosystem, charity initiatives, engaged community.
* **Targets:** Near-term 1.5M, with potential for previous ATHs (3M) and beyond.

**Contract Address:** 5odbSFH3kKHFNcy6Kai7ykm7Da9B55Kk9wgy4Fh8GSfh  
**Telegram:** @ pyratefun  
**Reddit:** r/ pyratefun

**Final Thoughts**  
The crypto market may feel like a rollercoaster at times, but it’s these fast-moving, dynamic environments where big gains are made. Whether you’re here for the memes, the mission, or the innovation, $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE all bring something unique to the table.

Follow me on Reddit for more in-depth analysis, market updates, and the latest projects worth your attention. Let’s make 2025 one for the books!

Conquest Jan 20th-24th,CarnivalCruiseFans,1i9v7k4,2025-01-25 14:44:52,5,0.86,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1i9v7k4/conquest_jan_20th24th/,anxious_labturtle,📝 Trip Report,"This was my boyfriend and I’s first cruise! We honestly came out with 0 expectations. We read a lot of poor reviews online and we only paid $850 for a balcony room so if it was great we paid $850 and if it was bad, well we only paid $850 and we were still on a boat in the ocean. We did pay $200 for wifi and we bought the bubbles package but not the cheers. 

We had the best time! I’m a planner and I decided to just go with the flow this vacation. I did minimal research, like mostly what to bring, what to do on land and how to get on/off the boat. We did a lot of trivia, we won $605 at bingo, we won $30 at deal or no deal for free play at the casino, we went to all the talks from the cruise director who was Savannah, and she was amazing and fun! We went to all the shows, the comedy shows, the live shows, the dining room shows, every thing we could watch in the theatre we went to, even like the disembarkation talk. 

The good 
• the food - the only food we had that wasn’t great was the buffet. We ate at all the free restaurants. We ate at the dining room every night. We had breakfast and sea day brunch. We had guy’s burgers, bar b Que, and the blue iguana taco place. We had pizza pirate. We didn’t have Sushi, the deli, the seafood shack, or the steak place. Basically we only ate free food. Since we won bingo and we had free $600 to spend we drank more than we probably would have. 

•the entertainment - the 80s show is kind of cheesy but the performers are really good. Love and Marriage was so funny. We played a lot of trivia and I tied with someone on Harry Potter trivia and I’m still mad I didn’t get the plastic ship. We love bingo and it’s expensive. We probably wouldn’t have paid $350 for it like we did if we hadn’t of won money at the $5000 bingo but it was fun. Our comedians were also actually funny. They didn’t repeat shows either. We went 3 times and we laughed at all shows. Even the lame 80s party was fun on the deck and we danced and acted silly because why not? 

•Ports - half moon cay was amazing. If it was 10 degrees warmer it would’ve been better but we laid out for about 4 hours in the beach and then got back on the boat. At Nassau we had a swim with the turtle excursion planned but because it was cold we cancelled it and walked around to the Queen’s staircase, Señor Frogs, and the Pirate Museum. Yeah there was a lot of people selling stuff at us but we just said no thank you and they left us alone. 

•The people - everyone on the boat was so nice. Ricardo was our room steward and he was the sweetest. The fun squad people were also so fun. Our waiters in the dining room were amazing. We ate in both because of having our time dining and going to breakfast and everyone was so nice. We had a weird charge come up on our account and guest services just removed it in 12 hours. 

The bad 

• our room - we had a balcony in the middle of the ship on the 6th floor. It was 6279. I picked it because I get really car sick and I was so scared of being sea sick. It was clean and Ricardo took great care of the rooms and hallway but it was small and the bed was so hard. The towels are also small and not as soft. We fully expected this and understand we’re on a smaller and older of the cruise ships but the first thing we both did when we got home was take a shower in our shower. Also, everyone says it but the A/C. The balcony was also not very large which again is to be expected. It’s also kind of scary when you’re out at sea and you look down. 

•the midnight buffet - we were really excited for 24 hour pizza and instead we had buffet until 2 and pizza till midnight. The midnight buffet was very lacking. It was buffet food. 

Overall - I’m worried we’ve become cruisers. We had a 5 day vacation that was minimal planning. We got good entertainment and we feel like we got a lot of value for our money. We read online about how trashy carnival was and we didn’t experience this at all. There was no fighting, no drugs, and everyone just genuinely having a good time. Every time we went to something, even if we just went to people watch, we had fun. I also didn’t expect the food to be so good and it was very good. We’re trying to plan another one for next year and go on a longer cruise on one of the newer boats. We definitely didn’t expect this to be as good of a vacation as it was. "
A watcher on the bank.,Rathara,1i9v1s6,2025-01-25 14:37:48,9,1.0,14,https://i.redd.it/1ng1a4jb07fe1.png,PopularRutabaga6904,Lorepost,"/It wasn't a common thing, though sometimes, one has to stop and breathe.

Late at night, Arda sat there, floating on the waters of a small lake near the ocean. Sitting and trying to collect herself after however much effort of both actions and thought.

She opened her eyes to glance at the moon, slowly taking in the gloomy view of the wilds of the island at night.

Everyso often, she'd notice some grim, hunched creature walking and then stopping along the bank, watching her as she lay still upon the lake's surface.

She reached into the air and pulled a miniature pistol from it, letting loose a shot at the disgusting spectre. Catching in that instant, a look at its' faded humanity and worse still, the crimson stains on its' pale, rot stricken face and rancid cloak.

She rose to her feet, to walk across the water, pulling a lance of ice from the waters and pelting it at the corpsefaced monster. Slowly returning to her spot as it sank into it./

The Bingo challenge is always a highlight of April for me - it's fun, always surprising, and gives me an excuse to shake up my TBR. This is my eighth card, and I’m already looking forward to the next one.

# Bingo 2024: Difficulty

Okay, I know this is subjective, but I found this year’s Bingo to be the easiest one yet. Most of the squares ""slotted"" into my reading naturally, and only two (Bards, Published in 1990s) required some actual research. One of those books turned out to be amazing; the other… let’s just say it wasn’t.

# Favorite Squares

* ***Judge a Book by Its Cover***: Super fun square! Plus, I picked a brilliant book for it, but your mileage may vary and perhaps I was just lucky.
* ***Eldritch Creatures:*** I love horror, so this was right up my alley.
* ***Small Town***: Something about cozy (or creepy) small-town vibes always hooks me.
* **Survival:** Who doesn’t love a good survival story?

# Least Favorite Squares

* ***Book Club/Readalong:*** Ironically, I lead a book club, yet this square always feels like a chore. Why? It gives less room for personal choice, and yes, I know I'm being irrational. The database of eligible books is massive. But I can't help it - it makes me feel it's a closed set and I like to have freedom :P Irrational, as mentioned. Happily, the book I picked for it is one of my favorite books read in 2024.
* ***The Bard***: Surprisingly, bards aren't that easy to find nowadays. The book I picked for this square was the weakest thing I read all year, but that’s on me. I could’ve done a better research.
* ***Romantasy:*** Look, I’m not a romance reader, so this square was always going to be a slog for me. I prefer my books dark, gritty, and romance-free. Fortunately, the book that happens to meet the criteria of the square is excellent, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

# BOOKS & MINI-REVIEWS

Here are my mini-reviews for each square. Most of these are shortened versions of my Goodreads reviews. Ideally, my Bingo card would feature only books I rated 4 stars or higher, but some squares make that tricky. If you have any recommendations for the trickier squares, hit me up - I want my card to represent the *best* books (that fit bingo squares) I read during the Bingo period.

# Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey

**First in a Series (HM);** *also* *Criminals, Under the Surface, Dreams, Multi-POV. Space Opera*

**Rating**: ★★★★☆

Confession time: I liked the TV series more. But that aside, this was still a great read. It’s epic but with a tight focus on personal stakes and well-rounded characters. The story is immersive, the ideas are clever, and there’s a reason this one’s a modern sci-fi classic.

# The Book That Broke The World by Mark Lawrence

**Alliterative Title (HM)**; *also Romantasy (I think), Dark Academia (probably), Under The Surface*

**Rating**: ★★★★½

Mark Lawrence really knows how to keep you hooked. This sequel is darker, faster-paced, and full of surprises. The multiple POVs and time jumps were cool. Livira and Malar’s struggles hit hard, and the insectoid enemies are creepy af.

# Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi

**Under the Surface**; also  *First in a series, Dreams, Character with a Disability, Survival, Published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Political intrigue? Check. Deeply personal stakes? Double check. Scheming Machiavellian side characters? Oh, yes. Navola delivers all this and more. Bacigalupi shifts from heartfelt moments to bursts of calculated violence and an overwhelming sense of bleakness with ease and perfect timing, and I savored every second of it. My favorite book of 2024.

# Dig Two Graves by Craig Schaefer

**Criminals (HM)**; *also Self Published, published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★½

As a massive fan of the Daniel Faust series, I might be biased, but this was fantastic. Sharp writing, morally grey characters, and an addictive plot made it one of my favorites.

# The Dream Master by Roger Zelazny

**Dreams (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

The Dream Master holds well despite being almost 60 years old. It has an outstanding premise - Charles Render specializes in neuroparticipation. Basically, he creates and controls/constructs dreams of his patients to get an insight into their neuroses and problems. Render takes on a patient with congenital blindness and a hunger for visual stimuli.

[ROW 2](https://preview.redd.it/15qtrij7t6fe1.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=057cbb915dc3a63734e439c364052c960fc26504)

# Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boule

**Entitled Animals (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

I saw at least two *Planet of the Apes* movies and enjoyed them. The story itself is immersive and action-packed, but some of the social dynamics haven’t aged well. Still, it’s an entertaining classic that I’m glad I read.

# Bard Tidings by Paul Regnier

**Bards (HM)**, also self-published

**Rating:** ★★

Fully predictable and instantly forgettable. The weakest book on my Bingo card. I picked it on a whim from Kindle Unlimited, and, well… mistakes were made.

# The Empusium by Olga Tokarczuk

**Prologues/Epilogues;**

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Empusium is a strange, slow, and fascinating book. It’s part gothic horror, part social critique, and part... well, something that doesn’t really fit into any category. Call it Weirdlit, if you need to. Anyway, if you’re looking for fast-paced thrills and gruesome horrors, this isn’t it. But if you enjoy well-written and unsettling books with elegant and plastic prose you’re in for a treat.

# Thrill Switch by Tim Hawken

**Self Published**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A cyberpunk thriller that pulls no punches. Brutal but brilliant.

# Fool's Promise by Angela Boord

**Romantasy (HM)**; also Dreams, Self-Published, Disabled (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★½

Fool’s Promise is a brilliant sequel that not only lives up to the high expectations set by the Fortune’s Fool but surpasses them in many ways. The story picks up some time after where the previous installment left off, and gets more complex, more twisted, and more thrilling.

[ROW 3](https://preview.redd.it/g1ertdfmt6fe1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8e388e44e6fa07c161894a1c72e112913eb7e92)

# The Young Elites by Marie Lu

**Dark Academia (HM)**; also disabled, POC author

**Rating:** ★★★

The Young Elites follows Adelina Amouteru, a young girl who survived a blood plague that gave her superpowers and a rather grim outlook on life. It’s a dark story filled with magic, darkness, and more teenage angst than I’ve consumed in any form of media in recent months :) Anyway, if you’re into brooding anti-heroes and dramatic twists, it will probably be right up your alley.

# The Devil By Name by Keith Rosson

**Multi-POV (HM)**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Devil by Name picks up five years after *Fever House* with all the chaos, gore, and gripping drama you’d expect—and then some. The world is still reeling from “The Message,” a weaponized sound that turned much of humanity into bloodthirsty monsters called the fevered. With Terradyne Industries running the show and humanity clinging to survival, the stakes have never been higher.

# Saturation Point by Adrian Tchaikovsky

**Published in 2024 (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

Adrian Tchaikovsky functions at a level of productivity most of us can only envy. A good thing for us, readers. I always thought he excelled at a novella format and Saturation Point proves my point. Fans of a climate apocalypse and existential dread - here’s your next fix.

# Death of the Author by Nnedi Okorafor

**Disability (HM)**; also First in a Series

**Rating:** ★★★★

*Death of the Author* walks a fine line between literary fiction and Africanfuturism. It’s also a nice example of the book-within-a-book format; we follow the events through Zelu’s life and excerpts from her sci-fi book. I liked how Okorafor shifted between the two genres. And I loved the surprising ending that connected both parts extremely well. But, you know, spoilers.

# The Prestige by Christopher Priest

**Published in the 90s (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Now, I’ve seen The Prestige adaptation and loved it. I wasn’t sure if the novel could still surprise me. The outline of the two versions is similar, but the book has better characterization and sheds more light on Augier’s point of view. It also adds a present-day struggle of Borden and Augier’s descendants. Andrew, for example, feels he has a twin brother, but his birth certificate contradicts it. Is he wrong?

Anyway, if you’ve seen the movie first, you’ll know most big twists. Will it decrease your enjoyment? I can’t promise anything, but it didn’t spoil the fun for me.

Some readers might say The Prestige is a slow burn, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But trust me, every moment of buildup is worth it for the payoff you get in the end. Priest takes his time setting the stage, slowly ratcheting up the tension until it reaches a brilliant climax.

The characterization is simply extraordinary. The strength of the voice is unforgettable.

*The Prestige* is excellent. It tells an unputdownable story of obsession, deception, and blurred boundaries between reality and illusion.

# The Oathsworn Legacy by K.R. Gangi

**Orcs, Trolls, Goblins (HM)**; also First in a Series, Criminals, self-published (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I admit the page count of most SPFBO X’s finalists terrifies me. The Oathsworn Legacy is on the chunkier side, but it reads surprisingly fast. Why? It’s well-written and structured more like a mini-series than a typical novel with a linear progression of the plot.

It’s made of interconnected stories, so instead of a straight shot from start to finish, each “episode” builds on the previous one but focuses on different aspects of the bigger story. Chapters introduce new players (good and evil), deepen relationships and the world. This might throw some readers off, but for me, it worked well. Especially that the characters are one of the strongest parts of the story: well-rounded, memorable, and complex.

# Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh

**Space Opera (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

*Some Desperate Glory* by Emily Tesh is a fast-paced, character-driven space opera that won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Not too shabby. While its fans praise the book for its critique of militarism and patriarchy, the intensity of its political messaging felt somewhat heavy-handed to me. Tesh’s writing is sharp, and she delivers a strong commentary on systems of oppression, but the characters can feel more like vehicles for these ideas than fully fleshed-out individuals. That said, I understand those who appreciate Some Desperate Glory’s subversive edge and rather fresh take on classic space opera tropes.

Overall, Some Desperate Glory is a bold, energetic novel with plenty of thought-provoking ideas, but its flaws—unlikable characters, a somewhat repetitive middle, and a too-neat ending—decreased my enjoyment. Still, it’s a noteworthy entry in modern sci-fi that combines thrilling action with larger social critiques.

# The DEAT CAT TAIL ASSASSINS by

**POC Author (HM)**; also Bards, Space Opera, Entitled Animals

**Rating:** ★★★★

It was a wild ride with a breakneck pacing and high fun factor. It surpassed my expectations - I found the mix of action, humor, and some horror refreshing and entertaining. And since it’s a short book, I finished it in no time, really. Eveen the Eviscerator is skilled and discreet assassin who plays by the book. She’s also deadly, undead, and wiped off any memories. She accepts a contract but can’t carry it and mayhem ensues.

# Bury Your Gays by Chuck Tingle

**Survival (HM**); also Eldritch Creatures (HM), Small Town  
**Rating:** ★★★★

What happens when you say “no” to Hollywood execs, dodge AI’s soulless algorithms, and accidentally bring your nightmares to life? In Chuck Tingle’s Bury Your Gays, the answer is a gory, clever, and unexpectedly heartfelt horror romp. Tingle’s writing is tight and unpretentious, with just enough sly humor to offset the tension. The ending sticks the landing, ties up themes of creativity, defiance, and queer resilience with a flourish.

I’m surprised by how much I liked Bury Your Gays. If you like your horror smart, scary, and more than a little meta, it is a must-read.

Audiobook narration: absolutely brilliant.

# Playground by Richard Powers

**Book Cover (HM)**; also Multi-POV (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I wasn’t sure what to expect when I picked up Playground. I loved the cover and the premise, but recently I mostly read fast-paced books with lots of action. All easy to enjoy and digest. This one is dense and layered. But it pulled me in, kept me hooked, and left me thinking. Sure, it’s complex and occasionally a little too proud of its own cleverness, but it’s also heartfelt and packed with moments of wonder. Now, I won’t pretend it’s all a smooth reading experience. The novel is dense, sometimes to the point of being intimidating. Powers clashes environmental themes, AI ethics, and human relationships, and while it’s fascinating, it sometimes felt a bit, well, much.

# Diavola by Jennifer Marie Thorne

**Small Town (HM)**; also Dreams

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A haunted house story with a twist. Diavola takes the genre’s best elements and gives them a snarky, personality-packed makeover. Anna, the narrator, is sharp-tongued and divisive - if her narration clicks with you, you'll have fun. Otherwise, you'll probably DNF it.

# Your Utopia by Bora Chung

**Short Stories (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

Disappointing overall. Thin ideas, solid execution.

# There is No Antimemetics Division by Qntm

**Eldritch Creatures (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

Oh man, what a trip! I heard it was weird, but I didn’t expect this level of weirdness. The Antimemetics Division is one of the SCP departments that deals with ""antimemes."" Huh? Essentially, “antimemes” are information black holes that prevent any knowledge about them from being retained or communicated.

Getting the hang of it requires a lot of mental gymnastics, but once you get past the beginning, everything becomes... Nah. Who am I kidding? It’s dizzyingly complex but also kind of fascinating.

It reads like a unique blend of weird fiction, sci-fi, and cosmic horror, told in a non-linear and scattered way. I found the book fascinating because of its weirdness and cool take on a cosmic horror. Objectively speaking, though, the prose is rather subpar and the characters flat. If you're looking for a great literary experience, this isn't it. If you're here to dig into a very interesting mythos handled uniquely, then you will love this.

Read it for fun and only if you’re okay with being confused most of the time :). 

# The Hidden Guardian By J.D.L Rosell

**Reference Materials (HM);** also arguably Dreams  
Rating: ★★★½

The stakes are higher, the world is bigger, and the action is grander in this third entry of *The Ranger of the Titan Wilds*. Epic fantasy fans will eat this up, but at 711 pages, it’s a bit much for readers like me who prefer tighter narratives.

# The Storm beneath The World by Michael R. Fletcher

**Book Club (HM)**; also Reference Materials HM, First in a Series, Under the Surface, Criminals

Rating: ★★★★½

Fletcher strikes again with this wildly imaginative and entertaining story. It's one of my favorite books of 2024.

# STATS

**Male-authored books:** 18

**Female-authored books:** 7

**Books by POC authors:** 4

**Thoughts:** I could do better in balancing these stats, but ultimately, I chose books that deserved a spot on the card and that I genuinely enjoyed. There are a few obvious exceptions, so I'm all ears if you have recommendations for women-authored books featuring bards, a better Dark Academia (I’ve already read *Blood Over Bright Haven* by M.L. Wang, unfortunately, so I can’t use it) and an anthology (perhaps *Book of the Witches* by Jonathan Strahan, since I already have a copy).

**The book that fits the fewest squares**: The Prestige, I think

**The book that fits the most squares:** ***Navola & Fool's Promise***

# AWARDS

Just for fun, here are some totally made-up and meaningless awards:

* **Best Plot Twist:** *Dig Two Graves* by Craig Schaefer - we finally learn who Paladin is and it's a shocker. But to appreciate it, you need to read the whole series.
* **The ""Did I Just Learn Science"" Award** *Playground* by Richard Powers contains genuine science about oceans and AI.
* **The ""I Will Not Shut Up About This"" Award** *The Storm Beneath The World*, because I think it's criminally underread and not as dark as other books by this author. In other words, give it a chance, it's worth it even if you haven't vibed with his previous stories.
* **Most Confusing Book That Was Worth It**  *There is No Antimemetics Division*. I'm really curious how strongly will it be changed for its traditionally published re-release.
* **Top 5 from the card:** *Navola, The Storm Benath The World, The Prestige, The Empusium, Fool's Promise. With that said, I feel almost all books from this card deserve to be given a chance.*

# Questions

* How’s your bingo coming along?
* Which squares have been a blast to fill, and which ones felt like pulling teeth?
* Read any of these or have them on your list? Do you agree with my takes, or think I’m way off? Let me know!"

10 Essential WordPress SEO Tips to Boost Your Website’s Google Rankings in 2025,u_dcpwebdesigners,1i9usl4,2025-01-25 14:26:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dcpwebdesigners/comments/1i9usl4/10_essential_wordpress_seo_tips_to_boost_your/,dcpwebdesigners,,"In today’s competitive digital landscape, having a website is no longer enough. To stand out, your WordPress site must be optimised for search engines like Google.

SEO ([Search Engine Optimisation](https://dcpweb.co.uk/seo-agency-london)) is the practice of improving your site’s visibility to increase organic traffic, and WordPress is an excellent platform for implementing SEO strategies. 

Here are **10 essential WordPress SEO tips** to help your website climb the search engine rankings in **2025**.

[SEO Tips to Boost Your Website’s Google Rankings](https://preview.redd.it/ltuarwway6fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9a521d06db876f3e348995af93e7b1627bc1d68)

# 1. Choose an SEO-Friendly WordPress Theme

Your WordPress theme forms the foundation of your website. An SEO-friendly theme ensures your site loads quickly, has a clean codebase, and is mobile-responsive—all crucial ranking factors.

* **Key Features to Look For**: Lightweight design, fast loading speed, schema markup support, and responsiveness.
* **Recommended Themes**: [Astra](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/astra), [GeneratePress](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/generatepress), and [OceanWP](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/oceanwp) are popular choices optimised for SEO.

**Pro Tip**: Use Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test tool to ensure your theme is responsive across devices.

# 2. Optimise Your Permalinks

Permalinks are the URLs for your blog posts and pages. WordPress provides default URL structures, but not all of them are SEO-friendly.

* Go to **Settings > Permalinks** in your WordPress dashboard.
* Choose the “Post Name” structure to make URLs short, descriptive, and keyword-rich.

**Example**:  
Instead of yoursite.com/?p=123, use yoursite.com/essential-wordpress-seo-tips.

# 3. Use an SEO Plugin

SEO plugins make it easier to optimise your content and website settings without requiring advanced technical skills.

**Recommended Plugins:**

* [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/): Provides content analysis, meta tag optimisation, and XML sitemap generation.
* [RankMath](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/rank-math): Offers similar features with an intuitive interface and schema support.

These plugins guide you in optimising your content for focus keywords, improving readability, and setting up meta descriptions and titles.

# 4. Conduct Keyword Research

Keywords are the backbone of SEO. Identify the terms your audience is searching for and use them strategically in your content.

**Tools for Keyword Research**:

* [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/)
* [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)
* [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)

Focus on **long-tail keywords** that reflect user intent. For example, instead of targeting “WordPress plugins,” aim for “best WordPress SEO plugins for small businesses.”

**Pro Tip**: Incorporate keywords naturally into your content to avoid keyword stuffing, which can harm your rankings.

# 5. Optimise Titles and Meta Descriptions

Your title tag and meta description are the first things users see in search results. They play a significant role in improving click-through rates (CTR).

**Best Practices**:

* Include your primary keyword in the title.
* Keep titles under 60 characters and meta descriptions under 160 characters.
* Write compelling, action-driven descriptions.

**Example**:

* **Title**: “10 Essential WordPress SEO Tips to Boost Your Rankings in 2025”
* **Meta Description**: “Learn 10 proven WordPress SEO strategies to improve your Google rankings in 2025. Optimise your site and drive organic traffic!”

# 6. Optimise Images for SEO

Large, unoptimised images can slow down your website, negatively impacting your SEO. Optimising images improves loading times and enhances user experience.

**Steps to Optimise**:

* Compress images using tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or plugins like [Smush](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/wp-smush-pro).
* Use descriptive filenames (e.g., wordpress-seo-tips.jpg).
* Add **alt text** to images to help search engines understand their content.

**Pro Tip**: Use the **WebP format** for faster loading without sacrificing quality.

# 7. Create High-Quality, Engaging Content

[Content remains king in SEO](https://dcpweb.co.uk/blog/8-linkable-content-ideas-that-attract-backlinks). Google prioritises websites that provide value to users, so focus on creating in-depth, engaging, and original content.

**Tips for Better Content**:

* Solve specific problems your audience faces.
* Use a mix of text, images, and videos.
* Structure content with headings (H1, H2, H3) for better readability.

**Pro Tip**: Aim for long-form content (1,000+ words) when tackling complex topics, as it often performs better in search rankings.

# 8. Improve Your Site’s Speed

Page speed is a critical ranking factor. Slow-loading websites lead to higher bounce rates, which can hurt your SEO.

**How to Improve Speed**:

* Use a caching plugin like [WP Rocket](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/wp-rocket) or [NitroPack](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/nitropack).
* Optimise CSS, JavaScript, and HTML using tools like [Autoptimize](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/autoptimize).
* Enable browser caching and leverage a **Content Delivery Network (**[**CDN**](https://dcpweb.co.uk/blog/5-key-benefits-of-using-a-cdn-for-your-wordpress-website)**)** like Cloudflare.

**Pro Tip**: Test your site’s speed using [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) or [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) and follow their recommendations.

# 9. Build a Strong Internal Linking Structure

Internal links connect your content, making it easier for users to navigate your site and for search engines to crawl it.

**Benefits of Internal Linking**:

* Improves page authority.
* Enhances user experience by guiding readers to related content.
* Helps search engines understand your site’s structure.

**Example**: If you have a blog post about “WordPress Plugins,” link it to related posts like “Best SEO Plugins for WordPress” or “How to Install a WordPress Plugin.”

**Pro Tip**: Use descriptive anchor text with relevant keywords.

# 10. Regularly Update and Maintain Your Website

A well-maintained [WordPress website](https://dcpweb.co.uk/wordpress-website-design) signals to Google that your content is up-to-date and relevant.

**What to Update**:

* Refresh old blog posts with new information and statistics.
* Fix broken links using tools like [Broken Link Checker](https://ahrefs.com/broken-link-checker).
* Ensure all plugins, themes, and WordPress core files are updated.

**Pro Tip**: Set a reminder to audit your website every few months to identify areas for improvement.

# Bonus Tip: Leverage Schema Markup

Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better and enhances the way your site appears in search results.

* Use tools like **Schema Pro** or **Rank Math** to add structured data.
* Popular schema types: FAQs, recipes, and reviews.

**Pro Tip**: Test your schema using [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) tool.

# Conclusion

Implementing these 10 WordPress SEO tips can significantly improve your site’s visibility on Google in 2025. From choosing an SEO-friendly theme to optimising your content and improving site speed, every small step counts toward better rankings.

Remember, [SEO](https://dcpweb.co.uk/seo-agency-london) is an ongoing process. Stay updated on the latest algorithm changes and continue refining your strategies for long-term success. With consistent effort and these actionable tips, your WordPress site will be well-positioned to dominate the search engine results pages (SERPs).

Top Venues for a Memorable Princess Party in Las Vegas,u_theonlineforyou,1i9usap,2025-01-25 14:26:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1i9usap/top_venues_for_a_memorable_princess_party_in_las/,theonlineforyou,,"Las Vegas is known for its excitement, entertainment, and dazzling venues, making it the perfect city to host a magical princess party. Whether you’re looking for an elegant indoor setting or an outdoor wonderland, Las Vegas offers a variety of spaces to create an unforgettable experience for your little one. With the right venue, you can transform your event into a fairy tale come to life. Here’s a list of top venue ideas for hosting a truly memorable **Las Vegas princess party**.

# 1. Luxurious Banquet Halls

For a grand princess party, a banquet hall provides the perfect setting. These venues are spacious, allowing you to create a royal atmosphere with castle backdrops, chandeliers, and elegant décor.

You can set up areas for activities like a royal ball, interactive storytelling, or craft stations where kids can make their own crowns and wands. The flexibility of these spaces lets you design a party that’s both magical and sophisticated, making your child feel like true royalty.

# 2. Scenic Parks and Outdoor Spaces

If you’re looking to take advantage of Las Vegas’ warm weather and sunny skies, a local park or outdoor venue can serve as a picturesque backdrop for a princess party. Many parks feature open spaces perfect for setting up tents, decorations, and activity areas.

Decorate with floral garlands, pastel-colored drapes, and fairy lights to create a whimsical garden theme. Outdoor venues also work well for activities like treasure hunts or princess-themed relay races. The natural beauty of these locations adds an extra layer of charm to your celebration.

# 3. Indoor Play Centers

For a stress-free and weather-proof option, consider hosting your princess party at an indoor play center. These venues are perfect for kids, offering plenty of space for games, crafts, and dancing.

Many indoor centers are equipped with amenities like soft play areas or interactive games, which can be incorporated into your party. With the right decorations, you can turn these spaces into a magical princess kingdom where kids can play and explore to their hearts’ content.

# 4. Garden and Botanical Venues

If you’re seeking a serene and enchanting atmosphere, garden venues and botanical spaces in Las Vegas are ideal for a princess-themed celebration. These venues naturally evoke a fairy tale vibe, with lush greenery, colorful flowers, and elegant pathways.

Host a royal tea party in the garden or set up an outdoor photo booth with a castle backdrop. Add fairy lights and whimsical décor to enhance the magical feel, creating a setting that looks straight out of a storybook.

# 5. Private Event Rooms

For a more intimate celebration, private event rooms in restaurants or community centers offer a great option. These spaces can be customized to match your princess theme with ease, from table settings to wall decorations.

Private rooms allow for a cozy atmosphere where kids can enjoy activities like storytelling, face painting, or singing along to their favorite princess songs. They’re perfect for smaller parties or families who prefer a relaxed yet magical setting.

# 6. Pools and Water-Themed Venues

For a unique spin on the traditional princess party, consider hosting your event at a pool or water-themed venue in Las Vegas. This is a perfect choice for a summer celebration or for kids who love water activities.

Add an ocean princess or mermaid theme to tie the venue into the party, with decorations like seashells, aquatic props, and pastel-colored balloons. Organize water-based games or activities like a “royal swim” to keep the kids entertained while they splash and play.

# 7. Residential and Backyard Parties

Sometimes, the best venue is right in your own backyard. With the right decorations and a little creativity, you can transform your home into a magical castle for your princess party.

Backyard parties are especially great for incorporating outdoor elements like a royal garden, a mini dance floor, or a crafting station. Plus, hosting at home allows you to have full control over the schedule and setup, making it easy to create a personalized experience for your child.

# 8. Themed Event Spaces

Las Vegas is known for its one-of-a-kind themed venues, and some of them are perfect for a princess party. From castle-inspired locations to spaces designed for kids’ parties, these venues offer a ready-made atmosphere that requires minimal decorating.

Themed venues often come equipped with props, furniture, and décor that complement the party’s fairy tale vibe. This option saves time on setup while still delivering a magical experience for your little one.

# 9. Las Vegas’ Unique Entertainment Venues

Take your princess party to the next level by hosting it at one of Las Vegas’ entertainment-focused venues. Some spaces offer stages or performance areas, perfect for adding live entertainment like a princess performer or musical act.

These venues let you create a larger-than-life celebration that feels like a royal gala. With Las Vegas’ flair for showmanship, your party can truly stand out as a memorable event.

# 10. Hotel Party Suites

For an upscale experience, consider hosting your princess party in a hotel suite or event space. Many Las Vegas hotels offer spacious suites with luxurious amenities, making them a fantastic choice for a royal celebration.

You can decorate the suite with castle-themed elements, set up activity stations, and even use the hotel’s catering services for a feast fit for royalty. Hosting in a hotel suite adds a touch of luxury that makes the event feel extra special.

# Final Thoughts

Las Vegas offers a variety of venues that are perfect for hosting a magical and unforgettable princess party. Whether you choose a garden setting, a glamorous banquet hall, or a cozy backyard celebration, the key is finding a space that reflects your child’s dream and brings the fairy tale to life.

With its unique blend of charm and excitement, Las Vegas is the ultimate location for crafting a one-of-a-kind **Las Vegas princess party** that will leave your child and their guests enchanted."

It just amused me for some reason. And thankfully, it helped me when I turned that into a profession. No, I am not a stalker, I am a psychologist.

It always baffles me, seeing how the human psyche can push people into zones that they cannot get out of as easily as one would like to. Beneath and beyond the blanket of anxiety and depression, lie an ocean of several other worms that keep picking at the brain. 

My gift of understanding people has pulled people from different walks of life - junkies, broken hearts, widows, divorcees, survivors. There are two things common amongst all my patients. One, no matter how hard life has kicked them, these are people who want to stand up again, get better. The hopeful smile with which these people enter my office never fails to mesmerize me. The other thing being the fact that they have absolutely no one to look for or after them. And that works wonderfully in my favour.

Did you think I kill my patients? No, absolutely not. Not right away, at least. These people come to me with high hopes, of course, it's my duty as a psychologist to listen to them, to their stories, understand what pushed them down. I love doing that. 

And I truly do listen. Every word, every sob, every fractured thought - I soak it all in. Their secrets, their regrets, their fears - they hand them to me like offerings, unaware of how much I savor the control it gives me. You see, my goal isn’t to heal them. It’s to see just how far I can push them.

I guide them with care, unraveling their defenses one thread at a time, always pretending to be their savior. They trust me, rely on me. And why wouldn’t they? I offer solace, a lifeline, the illusion of understanding. But the truth is, I’m not pulling them back from the edge - I’m leading them closer.

Every session is a calculated game. I plant ideas in their minds, let their doubts fester, their insecurities grow. I watch as the cracks deepen, as their fragile hope starts to wither. And when they leave my office, they carry my whispers with them, unshakable thoughts that haunt their every waking moment.

No, I don’t kill them. I don’t have to. The mind is its own weapon, and I’ve mastered the art of arming it.
To study the human psyche isn’t just my passion. It’s my playground. And in the end, everyone breaks."
💎 3 Hidden Gems Set to Dominate 2025,memecoins,1i9up9c,2025-01-25 14:22:50,40,0.95,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i9up9c/3_hidden_gems_set_to_dominate_2025/,gamer_paradiser,,"Hey everyone, Ark here!

The crypto market may be unpredictable, but that’s where some of the best opportunities lie. I’ve been tracking three standout projects - $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE. These projects are building serious momentum and offer unique value propositions for 2025. Here’s why you should keep them on your radar:

# $PLATH (SOL) – Conservation with a Twist

**$PLATH** is bridging the gap between innovation and impact. Their charitable focus on adopting endangered platypuses (21 and counting) through the WWF sets them apart, while their commitment to environmental stability hints at a broader charity roadmap for 2025.

But it’s not all about giving back - $PLATH has fun, too. Their Telegram and Reddit bots (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?) and upcoming NFTs add a layer of engagement for the community. Combine that with a strong team of diamond-handed whales, constant token burns, top-holder airdrops, and this project has serious long-term potential.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.1M
* **Strengths:** Charitable initiatives, original art, strong community engagement.
* **Targets:** Potential for a 2x-3x short-term, with significant long-term promise.

**$CATBAT** is not just a token; it’s a mission-driven initiative to clean up the crypto space. From developing ScamScout, a tool to help users avoid scams, to offering a unique rugged coin redemption platform, they’re tackling real issues head-on.

Daily token burns, top-holder airdrops, and partnerships with other major projects add to its appeal. Plus, the dev has locked his token supply for a year, building trust and ensuring stability for the community.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.7M
* **Strengths:** Anti-scam tools, daily burns, strong roadmap.
* **Targets:** ATH at 4M, with fast growth as tools roll out.

**$PYRATE** isn’t just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. From a rich storyline featuring characters and comics to a pfp builder web app and ocean-cleaning charity initiatives, this project is all about innovation and engagement.

With over 170K users of its Telegram bot, CEX listings on the way, and paid promotions kicking off soon, $PYRATE is positioning itself for explosive growth. Plus, their focus on community gaming (Minecraft and more) is a fun way to strengthen their loyal crew.

🔍 **Ark Analysis**:

Top 5 Ideas for Hosting a Princess Party in Tampa,u_erepresent,1i9uo5w,2025-01-25 14:21:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i9uo5w/top_5_ideas_for_hosting_a_princess_party_in_tampa/,erepresent,,"Hosting a princess-themed party is a magical way to celebrate your child’s special day. In a beautiful city like Tampa, the options for creating an enchanting event are endless, thanks to its stunning venues, vibrant community, and sunny weather. Whether you’re planning an indoor or outdoor event, the right theme and activities can transform your celebration into a fairy-tale experience. To help you plan, here are the top five ideas for hosting a Tampa princess party that will make your child feel like royalty.

# 1. Transform Your Venue into a Royal Castle

One of the best ways to bring the magic of a princess party to life is by turning your venue into a regal castle. With some creativity and attention to detail, you can set the stage for an unforgettable celebration.

* **Decor:** Use pastel-colored balloons, shimmering curtains, and fairy lights to create a whimsical atmosphere. Add castle-shaped banners, royal thrones, and princess-themed table settings to enhance the theme.
* **Photo Backdrop:** Create a photo booth area with a castle backdrop, props like crowns and wands, and twinkling fairy lights for stunning pictures.
* **DIY Ideas:** Incorporate simple DIY projects, such as crafting paper crowns for the tables or decorating chairs with sparkly ribbons.

Whether you’re hosting the party at home or at a rented venue, the royal castle theme is guaranteed to captivate your guests.

# 2. Host a Garden Tea Party

Tampa’s sunny weather makes an outdoor princess tea party a fantastic choice. This idea combines elegance with fun, giving kids the chance to enjoy a royal afternoon in a beautiful garden setting.

* **Decor:** Arrange tables with lace tablecloths, floral centerpieces, and vintage tea sets. Add pastel umbrellas or canopies for shade and a touch of sophistication.
* **Activities:** Include crown decorating or flower crafting as pre-tea activities. Let the kids enjoy a “royal tea tasting” with pink lemonade or juice served in tea cups.
* **Menu:** Serve finger sandwiches, mini cupcakes, and cookies shaped like tiaras and stars.

This idea works wonderfully in Tampa’s parks or even your own backyard, creating a charming and memorable event.

# 3. Plan an Enchanted Under-the-Sea Adventure

If your child loves mermaids and ocean-themed adventures, an under-the-sea princess party is the perfect option. Tampa’s proximity to water makes this theme even more fitting.

* **Decor:** Use shades of blue, teal, and purple with touches of shimmering silver. Add seashells, starfish, and netting to create an underwater effect.
* **Activities:** Organize a treasure hunt for “pearls” and “gold coins,” set up a bubble-blowing station, or host a mermaid sing-along.
* **Menu:** Offer snacks like fish-shaped sandwiches, “seaweed” veggie sticks, and ocean-themed cupcakes.

Whether you host the event poolside or at a waterfront venue, an under-the-sea theme is sure to make a splash.

# 4. Create a Winter Wonderland Princess Party

Bring the magic of a snow queen to sunny Tampa by hosting a winter wonderland princess party. This frosty theme is perfect for kids who love all things icy and magical.

* **Decor:** Use icy blues, whites, and silvers for your color palette. Add snowflake cutouts, faux snow, and silver garlands to create a wintery atmosphere.
* **Activities:** Kids can decorate snowflake ornaments, enjoy a “snowball toss” game with white beanbags, or sing along to their favorite snow queen songs.
* **Menu:** Serve marshmallow “snowballs,” frosted cookies, and hot chocolate with whipped cream.

This theme works well for indoor parties or air-conditioned venues, offering a cool escape from Tampa’s warm climate.

# 5. Host a Princess-Inspired Dance Party

For a lively celebration full of movement and music, a royal dance party is an excellent choice. Kids can channel their inner princess while twirling and dancing the day away.

* **Decor:** Turn your venue into a royal ballroom with elegant drapes, chandeliers, and a dance floor. Hang a disco ball for extra sparkle.
* **Activities:** Hire a princess performer to teach the kids simple ballroom dance moves. Add a freeze dance game with princess-themed music for extra fun.
* **Entertainment:** Play classic princess movie songs or hire a DJ to keep the energy high.

A dance party is perfect for kids who love to move and is guaranteed to have everyone smiling from ear to ear.

# Tips for Enhancing Your Princess Party

No matter which theme you choose, there are a few additional touches that can make your Tampa princess party even more magical:

* **Hire a Professional Princess Performer:** A professional princess can lead activities, sing songs, and create a truly immersive experience for your child and their guests.
* **Capture the Memories:** Set up a dedicated photo area and take plenty of pictures to remember the special day. Consider hiring a photographer for high-quality photos.
* **Send Guests Home with Favors:** Party favors like mini crowns, wands, or princess-themed goodies make for great takeaways.

# Final Thoughts

Hosting a Tampa princess party is a wonderful way to create cherished memories for your child and their friends. Whether you’re planning a royal ball, a garden tea party, or an under-the-sea adventure, Tampa’s versatility and charm provide the perfect setting for a magical celebration.

"New book Concept and Intro (Untitled) topic: Custom Jets, Management Struggles, UAP, Orbs",LincolnGermanaAuthor,1i9umy9,2025-01-25 14:20:03,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LincolnGermanaAuthor/comments/1i9umy9/new_book_concept_and_intro_untitled_topic_custom/,Stunning-Block8991,,"It's a fiction book about the custom jet industry and the orbs that have been seen across the world. Here's the first section of chapter 1. 

  
The Florida sun was bright in the mild January air, streaming through the hangar doors and casting golden stripes on the concrete floor. A gentle breeze carried the ocean's salty scent, rustling the palm trees by the tarmac. It was the kind of perfect winter day that made the tourists flock to Fort Lauderdale, a welcome escape from the icy grip of the north. Alex leaned against the cool metal wall of the hangar, taking a moment to appreciate the warmth on his skin and the vibrant blue of the cloudless sky. He was early, as usual, drawn in by the siren song of jet fuel and the promise of another day spent crafting dreams out of metal and wire.



Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, FXE to those in the know, was a haven for the ultra-rich, a place where private jets outnumbered people most days. AetherJet, housed within the sprawling Banyan Air complex, catered to the most discerning of these clientele, transforming ordinary aircraft into bespoke palaces that defied both gravity and imagination. Alex had been a part of it all for five years, working his way up from wide-eyed apprentice to a key member of the design team, a far cry from the old Cessnas he'd helped maintain in his early days. He had the best job in the world, and if it weren't for the orbs, he wouldn't be questioning his sanity.



He took another deep breath, trying to shake off the lingering unease that had become his constant companion. It had started subtly, with fragmented dreams – swirling lights, disembodied voices, a sense of being watched. He'd dismissed them as stress, the byproduct of long hours and demanding clients. But they'd grown more intense, more real, bleeding into his waking hours like a half-remembered nightmare. Now, when he closed his eyes, he saw the orbs.



He pushed away from the hangar wall and walked towards the massive sliding doors, the rising sun casting his long, lanky shadow across the concrete. Inside, the hangar was a cathedral of industry, a cavernous space filled with the tools and technology needed to turn dreams into reality. But today, the familiar hum of machinery and the banter of the early crew did little to dispel the sense of quiet dread that had settled over everything.



It was the orbs, of course. They dominated every conversation, every news cycle, every fleeting thought. They hung suspended, impossibly large and luminous, like giant, iridescent pearls cast against the backdrop of the Florida sky. Nobody knew what they were, where they came from, or what they wanted. They'd first appeared a few months ago, a handful at first, then more, until they were a constant, unsettling presence in the heavens. Governments issued bland reassurances, scientists offered vague pronouncements, but the orbs remained, silent and enigmatic.



The news channels, of course, had a field day. Every day there was a new expert, a new theory. Were they weather balloons? Drones? Some new, classified military technology? Or were they something else entirely, something… alien? The speculation was endless, fueled by grainy footage and shaky eyewitness accounts that flooded social media. Husbands argued with their wives about going out after dark, kids had nightmares about monsters that came down from the orbs, and dogs barked incessantly at the sky, sensing something their human companions couldn't quite grasp.



Alex, however, felt something. A subtle shift in the air, a low-frequency hum that vibrated deep within his bones. It was a feeling of being watched, scrutinized, judged. And it was growing stronger every day, especially when he was working on this particular aircraft.



He turned his attention back to the jet. Its interior was a blank canvas, a cavernous space waiting to be transformed into a palace in the sky. The client, a new player on the global stage, had spared no expense, demanding the most advanced technology, the most luxurious materials, and a level of customization that bordered on the absurd. But lately, their requests had taken a strange turn. They wanted specialized shielding in certain sections of the fuselage, modifications to the communication systems that seemed unnecessary, even counterintuitive, and a reinforced panic room that could withstand a small nuclear blast.



He pulled up the latest set of blueprints on his tablet, his brow furrowing as he examined the intricate schematics. The modifications were unlike anything he'd seen before. They weren't just about luxury or comfort; they were about… protection. But protection from what?



A sudden, sharp clang echoed through the hangar, making him jump. He turned to see a young technician struggling with a heavy piece of equipment. Alex sighed. Even the most experienced hands were on edge these days. The orbs had that effect on people. They amplified anxieties, stoked fears, and eroded the sense of security that had once been taken for granted.



He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to center himself. He needed to focus, to push aside the unsettling thoughts that crowded his mind. He had a job to do, a deadline to meet. But as he opened his eyes and looked back at the blueprints, a single, chilling thought echoed in his mind: what if the client knew something that everyone else didn't? What if those modifications weren't just the whims of a paranoid billionaire, but a desperate attempt to prepare for something far worse than anyone could imagine? What if this plane was not meant to fly, but to flee? And what if the orbs were not just watching, but waiting? He thought for a moment that maybe, he should try that meth. He pushed the thought out of his mind. No. That wasn't him. He stared back at the blueprints, wondering what fresh hell was coming their way.

Should I play this game if I have a genuine fear of the ocean?,subnautica,1i9ui67,2025-01-25 14:14:15,16,0.84,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1i9ui67/should_i_play_this_game_if_i_have_a_genuine_fear/,ibedemfeels,Question - SN,"For context- I'm (38m) a grown man and I promise I'm not a total coward. I ride motorcycles, I'm a boxer, I have a bunch of tattoo's, etc. but I have been too scared to try and play this game.

I love aa indie games especially games with exploration, crafting, and reasonable survival elements.

I also have a real, legitimate fear of the open ocean and deep ocean. The thought of cruising through the deep, dark water and running into a leviathan is enough to give me a panic attack.

Honest question- are the intense parts of this game something someone can get passed or is it a genuinely rough go for anybody with a fear of the ocean?
