I am also less familiar with the way that the inverse trig functions work in this context. I always use arctan, but other function provide differing results, such as arccos(R/Z) and arcsin(X_T/Z).

i LOVE my king and when i retire him i would like to keep his appearance so i can continue working on him (unless i get a rlc first)

but what do you think would help me improve him? i don't get many studs, most i've done in a week is about half of the allowance, and i want to get more, but i realise that's difficult without a variety of breed only traits.

although i'll also think about different mutations to give him in his next life! i adore patches and piebalds but theyre just not worth it profit-wise so i'll certainly take suggestions. i prefer keeping it g1-g2 though so suggestions must be reasonably cheap and young within those generations (<50gb)

he produces beautiful cubs tbh and it would be a huge shame to lose that ability, but i'm happy to remove/replace his tier 0 markings if there are applicators that people like and would fit him

i take studs btw check the number in the top and send a request if you're interested, just let me know so i can deal with it as i don't check up on lioden all too often"

How to Fix Bad Microphones on Reolink Cameras,reolinkcam,1i8myyp,2025-01-23 23:10:02,6,0.88,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/reolinkcam/comments/1i8myyp/how_to_fix_bad_microphones_on_reolink_cameras/,First_Proposal_4635,Discussion,"Since I couldn't find anyone teaching how to fix the infamous low audio pickup issue that affects several Reolink models, I decided to speculate about the general cause of this problem and what solution worked on my cameras.

**In short: try replacing your camera's electret microphone. (Yes, this worked for me.)**

I'm not going to say that the cause of all problems with muffled or ""underwater"" audio pickup is always caused by a faulty microphone, but in the two cameras I tested, it was.

The cameras I replaced the microphone in were the RLC-510WA and the RLC-410W. They didn't have the ""underwater"" sound, but they did have extremely muffled sound. Of the two RLC-510WAs I own, the newer one had a useless microphone.  I could barely pick up voices from people 2m away, while the other 510WA unit, an older one that I already had, always had good audio capture, although not as good as an 810A or 811A.

One of the RLC-810A units that I bought last year also had a bad microphone, with the infamous ""underwater"" sound. And because of that, I ended up selling it, without even trying to fix the problem.

On the 510WA, initially, I just unplugged the native microphone and plugged in the new microphone, in an attempt to find out the cause of the problem. Immediately upon turning on the camera, the difference was huge. The replacement microphone could now capture sounds much further away and with a much higher level of detail than the original microphone, although it was producing a shrill background noise. Nothing that bothered me, it just wasn't a completely clean sound.

As soon as I did this initial test, I thought that it might be possible to save the microphone originally built into the camera. I believed that it was a factory assembly problem.  Maybe they had overdone the silicone sealant, closing the sound input hole. But that wasn't the case.

The microphone was really defective. Reolink apparently uses the most generic microphones produced in China in its cameras.

I immediately repeated the test on my old RLC-410W, although it had a slightly better audio capture than the RLC-510WA. I always believed that the low capture sensitivity of this camera was a characteristic of the product, since it was an entry-level model and not a defect.

The audio capture of the 410W was now as good or perhaps even better than that of the 510WA with the replaced microphone, although neither of them reached the same 10/10 quality as the RLC-810A or 811A, but they came close, let's say 8/10.

These microphones can be purchased with the universal connector for security cameras. Or you can just buy the electret microphone and solder it to the original wiring of the camera.

 In my case, I already had a few of these microphones at home, having bought them for another project. They were a bit too big for the small slot that the cameras had, so I had to wear down the metal to get them into position.

Make sure that there is a good seal to keep out any rain or moisture.

Let us know if this solved the problem for you.

It's lit up like an industrial park because that's what it is. After comparing the CX-810 to the CX-410 and the RLC-811, CX-810 seems to be the best choice for this application. Here's my logic, tell me if anything seems wrong:

- Lots of nighttime lighting will prevent the RLC-811 from going into IR mode, which defeats the point of having a camera designed for IR night vision in the first place

- The CX-410 is known to perform better in ultra low light than the CX-810, but the CX-810 does better in applications with more light thanks to its higher resolution 

- Will the light source being two really bright lights cause issues (versus having a lot of little lights)? The lights will be mounted higher up on the wall than the cameras to keep them out of the cameras' field of view, but there's still going to be a massive amount of light coming from two concentrated locations.

Wife doesn't like the look of cameras on the walls, so went with a plan for soffit installs.  Of course, I hadn't considered that the Duo 2 Floodlight isn't intended for soffit mount.  Additionally, home builder AV installer put rectangle gang boxes at each camera point. 

Will RLC-1224A mount to a rectangle gang box on the soffit?  I'm thinking the screw pattern won't be exact,.  Maybe put a blank plate over the gang box and screw the mount into the plate.

  
What about the Duo 2 Floodlights? I've seen some mount them to the soffit, and could potentially use a mount I found on Etsy to make it like a wall mount, or do I go with the B10?

Will the B10 Junction boxes from Reolink mount to an existing gang box or are they made to mount direct to surface, and I will end up in the same scenario of trying to figure out how to mount to the gang box?

Wife would prefer black cameras to match the soffits, so may need to find an alternative to Reolink as I don't think they have black options. "

First season I mostly dominated using a 4-3-3 Control Possession and got promoted to League One. This season I switched to a 5-3-2 like you see above. I was doing well this season too until December where it looks like I've been found out.

I've been trying to switch the roles of the L CB to BPD Stopper, Cover, and Defend with no luck. I even tried WCB Support roles on either side with only minimal success. The R BPD on Stopper does seem to work well with the CWB

As for midfielders, the CM generally stays on AP Attack or Support but the DMs can't find success with any role as one of them goes invisible during the game. I tried moving to one DM and 2 CM but then I have the same problem with the second CM's role.

I've left the forwards as they are, they seem to be the right roles as I'm finding it working well with the CWB on the right.

Any recommendations to improve midfield roles or any other instructions would be appreciated!"
Off grid surveillance setup using poe cameras,reolinkcam,1i6fivl,2025-01-21 05:17:04,2,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/reolinkcam/comments/1i6fivl/off_grid_surveillance_setup_using_poe_cameras/,tovanl,PoE Camera Question,"Hello,

I've been looking into getting a 3-4 camera system to monitor some scientific experiments that will happen off grid. Here is the expected conditions:

\- No router with internet connection, at best phone mobile network with limited data

\- Likely no electricity, but access to large-ish power banks with both AC and DC outs

\- Need to record for 4-5 hours at a time

\- Will have a laptop on site

The camera I think would work for us (based on fov, framerate and resolution) is the poe Reolink RLC-811A.

  
If I understand this correctly, I should be able to connect the 3-4 cameras to reolink's poe switch (RLA-PS1) using ethernet cables, and then connect the poe switch to my laptop with another ethernet cable (and it should automatically recognize that the laptop needs no power) and be able to control the cameras on the laptop using the reolink client. I would do all the data recording on individual sd cards, unless this system allows for recording from all camera to go directly on the laptop through the ethernet (would it?), both are fine with me. The only power I would need is for the poe switch, which should be able to run on a large power bank if only 3-4 cameras are connected, right?

Would this system work? Any issues I would encounter due to the lack of internet or having to work with a power bank with the switch? Would an NVR add anything to this particular application? Would a completely different setup be better for my situation? Thank you so much for your support!

Among them a couple of non-operational RLC-410s (one 4 megapixel 410W and a 410-5MP to be exact). 

And before I go salvaging parts from them for DIY CX-like full color low light cameras, I thought maybe there's a chance to repair them.

I've read that 410s are quite sensitive to power surge and that's why their sudden death is so widely discussed topic. I don't know the history of the ones I have, but if assumed they were killed by surge, is there some specific component(s) that are known to go bad or is the mainboard fried more widely and there's no hope to be saved by hobbyist. 

I mean, I'd be ready to try changing some SMD components, but I don't have the skills nor the equipment to test and diagnose the boards myself.

Only sign that I get from the boards is a faint buzz when I power them with a 12v adapter. I don't have any PoE device to use for powering 410-5MP that way.

Duo 3V PoE Install/Review,reolinkcam,1i5c003,2025-01-19 18:11:42,45,0.97,34,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i5c003,lev_9291,Trial  & Review,"I recently replaced my RLC-820A with the Duo 3V PoE and thought I‚Äôd share some install and comparison photos. Make sure to fully expand the pictures. 

So far, I‚Äôm really liking the Duo 3V. The night vision is noticeably better than the 820A, which is a big plus. The image quality feels about the same, if not slightly better. The horizontal FOV is quite an upgrade obviously, and even the vertical FOV is better, going from 44¬∞ on the 820A to 53¬∞ on the Duo 3V.

The only minor annoyance so far is the 5-second limit on the custom siren. I‚Äôd like to record a longer voice message, but the 5-second restriction is a bit limiting. I believe this is the same for all Reolink cameras with a speaker though.  

Note: I purchased this camera myself, it‚Äôs not a trial. I just couldn‚Äôt find a more applicable flair.

RLC-811WA - Does it need SD or NVR?,reolinkcam,1i5b78b,2025-01-19 17:36:02,2,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/reolinkcam/comments/1i5b78b/rlc811wa_does_it_need_sd_or_nvr/,the-jfontane,Wi-Fi Wired Camera Questions,"Hi all, new to the Reolink game so excuse ignorance.

  
I'm looking to get a camera to record from about 10 floor high (30 meters or so). I'm set on the [RLC-811WA](https://reolink.com/product/rlc-811wa/) because of the good reviews of its Zoom.

I just confused, will I be able to access footage of this camera in real time just like I do on my ring system? I don't want to be recording things on SD cards and would prefer to not buy an NVR... 

I like the simplicity of Ring but the image quality is very bad hence looking to upgrade. But I would prefer to not add the complexity cost of an NVR (and SD simply wouldn't do it for me).

Separately, would this camera have the functionality of recording 24/7 or will it be only with motion detection?

Thank you!"

PoE camera linked to Wifi NVR through bridge does not appear in NVR,reolinkcam,1i54s6b,2025-01-19 13:10:49,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/reolinkcam/comments/1i54s6b/poe_camera_linked_to_wifi_nvr_through_bridge_does/,HopefulMaximum0,Question,"I have a RLN12W wifi NVR and 2 wifi cameras which work well together.  I also got a third camera to cover a long alleyway:  the RLC-81MA PoE camera, which will be installed on a detached building that has power but not Ethernet.  

To connect it to the NVR, I bought an LG ETPFBTRP01 PoE wifi bridge, which is capable of supplying 320 mA at 48V, which is more than the 12 watts the camera needs.  It's used in LG Vivint installations, so it seemed appropriate.

I first tested the camera connected to an Ethernet port on the NVR with appropriate 12V power, and configured it without problems.  It appears in the main NVR viewing screen and I can use all it's functions.

I separately tested the bridge by connecting to my regular network and plugging a laptop in it.  I could pass through without a problem, and the laptop was seen by the router with it's own MAC address and network identification.  So the bridge is transparent.

I reset the bridge and connected it to the NVR's wifi, which seemed to work.   I then connected the camera to the PoE port of the bridge, and the bridge status lights gave the ""all clear"" for connections.   I see network activity but the camera is never recognized by the NVR.  I checked in the ""Device connections"" of the Wifi configuration screen, and only the two other cameras are there.  I also tried ""Add new camera"" with no success.

Is there some way to troubleshoot this?   Did anybody use this bridge with success?  Did anybody use this type of integrated PoE wifi bridge and has some tips?"

Everything has the latest software updates as of 1/19/25 


Nothing is plugged directly into the NVR.  


I'm reworking my network to add a Frigate server, and rather than directly connecting to the IP's of the cameras themselves, I'd like to instead pull the stream off of my NVR.  This works great for the primary feed from each camera, but I'm scratching my head about how (or if) I can do this with the zoom images from the  RLC-81MA's and the Trackmix tracking zoom images.    Is there a different name for these feeds that I just can't locate online?  Or am I going to have to direct connect to the cameras themselves to pull that zoom feed?"
