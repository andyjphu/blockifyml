How many players can you fit on a single paper server?,admincraft,1i9vrxu,2025-01-25 15:10:00,0,0.25,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/1i9vrxu/how_many_players_can_you_fit_on_a_single_paper/,BeautifulAd967,Discussion,"Been trying to push the limits lately and want to see what are people think is possible? Normally my server starts lagging when we have around 900-1,000 players online. Recently ended up dropping to 19 tps when we hit our record of 1,036 online.

Just wondering what other peoples experience in hosting a large server is.

For reference I only use a single paper server, and a single world so not able to be like hypixel and have a lot of minigames so not sure what I can optimize.

What is the best path forward for better performance and letting more players play at the same time?

(Sorry english is not my first language)

"This is bad, right?",castiron,1i9vc6f,2025-01-25 14:50:36,20,0.79,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vc6f,AtomicEdgy,Newbie,"Flagged this as “newbie” since I’ve never encountered this issue before. I’m also not super well-verses in every cast iron, but I have a 10” Calphalon round griddle that I’ve had for 15+ years. I maintain it and have only had rust-like issues on the back that were easily resolved. 

The current issue is with the two 6.5” skillets I purchased off Amazon (first mistake, I know). Each one has a rather harsh chunk missing from the edge opposite the handle. I received the second one as a result of returning (in process) the first one. 

Am I overthinking this or are these damaged? If not damaged, how would one “fix” this?"

*Hello everyone! I hope you all had a fantastic week filled with joy and good moments. My week has been quite pleasant despite the biting cold that makes me yearn for the warmth of spring. The chilly temperatures outside have me dreaming of blooming flowers and sunny days. To help lift my spirits during these frosty days, I turned to music, which played a pivotal role in warming my heart and soul. The melodies and lyrics provided a cozy escape, making the cold months more bearable. What about you? How did your week go? At the beginning of the week, Got7 made a highly anticipated return with a new project that quickly became a favorite on my playlist. Their fresh sound and engaging visuals showcase their growth as artists. In addition, I was thoroughly impressed by a debut from a new artist that left a lasting impression on me. Their unique style and strong vocals stand out in today's music scene. I also checked out Minnie's solo debut, which I found decent. While it may not have blown me away, it showcased her distinctive artistry and potential as a solo performer. Overall, it's been an exciting week for music! Now, let's delve into the music world and examine what the artists have created in detail. We'll explore their unique styles, lyrical themes, and the emotions they convey through their work. Let's discover the depth and artistry behind their performances.*

*Zerobaseone is back with a pre-release for their upcoming Korean mini album. Doctor! Doctor! has this chill R&B vibe with a killer baseline that has been stuck in my head. The smooth vocals blend wonderfully with the overall vibe. The hook has a bouncy vibe, keeping that chill vibe from the beginning of the tune. The rap in the second verse is decent, as it flows well with the overall vibe. I've been having this tune on repeat cause it's been popping up on my playlist. We get chanting vocals during the bridge that tie everything together before the final hook comes into the mix.*

[1,2,3,4 - Coogie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTD_Ryboxho&pp=ygUQMSwyLDMsNCAtIENvb2dpZQ%3D%3D)

*K-hip hop rapper Coogie is back with a new single, and Coogie is helping with the composition. The track goes for this synth-trap beat that works well with the rapper's smooth rap verses. It sounds like the rapper is going for a chiller vibe, then some of the songs we heard from him. Coogie still delivers some excellent rap flows that fit the overall vibe. The last time we heard Coogie, he got featured on the recent Kwon Eun bi track, but now he is back with a new tune that might be on repeat for me. However, only time will tell.*

Super☆Girls is back with a cute, bouncy synth-pop tune that has been smiling during my listens of this tune. The cute vocals are something that pulls me back to the tracks from the group. The hook has that bouncy flavor that helps the song get stuck in my head as I've replayed it like crazy. This new tune from the group isn't my favorite, but it still works well with the overall sound Super☆Girls delivers. I'm still glad the group is offering new music for us, as I always love what the group provides us.

"Close Reading Of ""Darkseid""",GrimesAE,1i9u6r1,2025-01-25 14:00:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9u6r1/close_reading_of_darkseid/,devastation-nation,,"Grimes’s “Darkseid” featuring Pan (formerly Aristophanes) is a haunting, surreal exploration of grief, existential anxiety, and the body as a site of emotional and cosmic unrest. The interplay between Grimes’s ethereal production, Pan’s cryptic, visceral lyrics in Mandarin, and the repeated refrain, “Unrest is in the soul, we don’t move our bodies anymore,” constructs a piece that is both intensely personal and disturbingly universal. This close reading examines the track through Æ’s framework of super-planetary affairs, emotional dynamics, and transformative engagement with grief, sacrifice, and survival.

The Soundscape: A Super-Planetary Aesthetic

The track’s sonic texture is minimalistic yet suffused with tension. The low, rumbling bass evokes a sense of weight and dread, while the ethereal, high-pitched tones create a sense of otherworldliness. These elements mirror the tension in the lyrics: between the body and the soul, the personal and the cosmic, survival and sacrifice.

For Æ, this soundscape reflects a “super-planetary” sensibility, where human emotions and narratives are framed within larger, cosmic contexts. The music evokes the vastness of space and the inexorable pull of planetary forces, grounding the deeply human experience of grief in a universe indifferent to individual suffering. This juxtaposition invites listeners to consider their place within a web of interrelated forces, both physical and emotional.

“Unrest is in the Soul, We Don’t Move Our Bodies Anymore”: The Chorus as a Lament for Stasis

The repeated chorus acts as a mantra, reinforcing the central theme of disconnection. The soul is restless, yet the body remains immobile—a paradox that captures the paralysis of grief and existential dread. The phrase can be interpreted as a critique of modernity, where the body, as a vessel for vitality and movement, is rendered inert by emotional and spiritual unrest.

For Æ, this speaks to the need for emotional flourishing and societal structures that nurture the soul’s dynamism. The paralysis described here is not just personal but systemic, pointing to the ways in which collective grief and disconnection can immobilize entire communities or societies. It’s an invocation to rediscover the body as a site of resilience and transformation.

Pan’s Verse: The Body as a Site of Cosmic Grief

Pan’s lyrics, delivered in Mandarin, are richly layered with visceral imagery that blurs the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical. The skin “secretes shadow,” and the body becomes a vessel for another’s death. Grief is embodied—transmuted into saliva, tears, and algae-like remnants within the self.
	1.	The Body as a Site of Absorption and Transformation:
The line “My skin opens an invisible wound / Takes your death in / To be part of my existence” portrays the body as a permeable boundary, absorbing external pain and making it intrinsic. This is not a passive process; it’s transformative, as grief and death become inextricably linked to identity. For Æ, this aligns with the idea of emotional labor as a generative force—one that redefines the self through engagement with pain and loss.
	2.	The Symbolism of the “Caves” in the Throat:
Pan describes the throat as containing “stiff and white caves,” a haunting image that suggests spaces within the body where grief and memory calcify. These caves, filled with saliva and transformed by tidal forces, represent a cyclical process of retention and release, mirroring the ebb and flow of emotion. Æ might interpret this as an allegory for the need to confront and process emotional wounds rather than letting them fossilize within.
	3.	Cosmic Grief and the Tide:
The imagery of tides responding to the moon connects the deeply personal experience of grief to celestial rhythms. This reflects a super-planetary perspective: the acknowledgment that human emotions are part of larger, universal patterns. Grief is not isolated but is woven into the fabric of existence.

Sacrifice and Survival: Existential Questions in the Second Verse

The second verse shifts focus to themes of sacrifice and survival. Pan questions the nature of life as “a long-lasting sacrifice” and the arbitrariness of who is chosen to survive and who is left behind. The imagery of “exploded stars” and “burned fire” situates these questions within a cosmic framework, suggesting that individual suffering is mirrored on a universal scale.

For Æ, this evokes the tension between agency and inevitability. The survivor’s guilt expressed here—“Why is it you to sacrifice this time?”—points to the arbitrary nature of existence, challenging listeners to find meaning in a universe that often seems devoid of it. This resonates with Æ’s vision of transformative engagement: embracing life’s uncertainties as opportunities for reflection, adaptation, and connection.

Collaboration Across Language and Culture

Grimes’s decision to collaborate with Pan, allowing her to deliver the verses in Mandarin, adds another layer of complexity to the track. The language barrier itself becomes a metaphor for the ineffability of grief and the universality of its expression. While many listeners may not understand the lyrics directly, the emotive delivery transcends linguistic boundaries, emphasizing the shared human experience of loss and survival.

For Æ, this collaboration exemplifies the potential of cross-cultural exchange to generate new forms of understanding and connection. By integrating Pan’s distinct voice and perspective, Grimes creates a track that is both deeply personal and expansively universal—a hallmark of Æ’s vision for super-planetary affairs.

Conclusion: Toward a New Vision of Survival

The final outro poses the question, “What does it take to be a survivor?” This is not a rhetorical question but an invitation to reflect on the physical, emotional, and cosmic toll of survival. The body retains the “eternal pain” of others’ deaths, making survival itself an act of endurance and transformation.

For Æ, this calls for a reimagining of survival as more than just persistence—it is a process of integration, where grief and loss become catalysts for growth and connection. The track’s layered exploration of these themes—through sound, language, and imagery—offers a powerful example of how art can illuminate the complexities of existence, bridging the personal and the super-planetary.

In “Darkseid,” Grimes and Pan create a work that resonates with Æ’s ethos of emotional dynamism, transformative grief, and the cosmic interconnectedness of all sentient beings. The track is a testament to the generative power of collaboration and the unyielding human capacity to find meaning, even in the face of darkness."
[Fully Lost] Sparkle and Aunt Grace YouTube Video - Ghetto Zombies From The Hood,lostmedia,1i9t66k,2025-01-25 13:16:43,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostmedia/comments/1i9t66k/fully_lost_sparkle_and_aunt_grace_youtube_video/,TheMucinexBooger,Internet Media,"There was a YouTube channel in the early days of YouTube called Sparkle and Aunt Grace. The channel at one point uploaded a video called Ghetto Zombies from the hood. I would be interested to find any of their old videos, but especially interested in this one

I believe the person behind the channel was an aspiring actor and would do many of the characters in the skits and videos they wrote and uploaded.

Makes sense why it has been taken down as it would be extremely problematic in today's time, but I have been trying periodically to dig up the video over the years as a gift to a friend who showed me the video a long long time ago. I haven't had much luck searching internet archival sites as I am not super versed in them so any advice there would be appreciated as well!"

"Just saw some post regarding K-K getting deleted, and being from that region has something to say!",Bengaluru,1i9m15f,2025-01-25 07:35:31,5,0.73,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bengaluru/comments/1i9m15f/just_saw_some_post_regarding_kk_getting_deleted/,OriginalPaper2130,Opinion | ಅನಿಸಿಕೆ ,"I kindly request mods to not delete the post as i'm telling you the reality of K-K region

first of all, Hyderabad Karnataka, antha Karibedi. We hate to associate with that word it is good to recognise us as Kalyana Karnataka.

yes all those points accept 5th one are true Barri paan navu matra tintidre bere kadde iroo pan masala angandi band agbek ittu

The situation of KK is mostly because of the nizam's exploitation during british rule, it wouldn't be the situation if we were under british or mysore region

Hopeless politicians who just use people for vote bank and some community people who just vote for them

Try walking into the cities of bidar, kalaburgi,raichur and Yadgir. You will notice mini-pakistan kinds of areas around all prominent cities. People just don't ask questions to politicians like those from bengaluru,mysore and hubli, even if anyone dares to do so, you will be silently finished or ignored. so, instead of that, people in these regions use their caste to please these casteist-minded politicians when they get elected. these politicians only visit the constituencies during K-K Liberation day, Independence Day, etc

current situation: half of the population of all the rural areas are working in bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad as construction workers , just see the crowd when any train from Gulbarga comes to Bengaluru. the rest half are involved in farming with no hope for the future, those who don't own the farms move to towns to work as daily labourers in market places. The only aim of these people is to get good education for their children and settle them in bengaluru!

The politicians are just opening hospitals after hospitals but not doing anything to solve the migration issues of the region. Adu yeno KKRDB antha madudru Adre, 80% of the positions are still vacant, and those who have jobs are just looting money from that board in the name of development.

monne yesto jana pregnant women sattru wrong medicine supply inda yardadru respond madudra, be it politicians or media, all were busy with DBOSS and BIGG BOSS

Just yesterday their was a protest in kalaburgi for a separate railway division because it was joined with the Solapur division. Just look at the revenue that comes from kalaburgi, Yadgir, and Raichur areas, it is more than Solapur, but still we are forced to be in that division.kalaburgi railway station earns more income than than hubli railway station but still were not getting included in SWR.

Even after so many years of hand -party rule, nothing good has happened in the region. People tried voting for the flower party, and after that, we just saw those mla's and mp's building their super deluxe, multi storied houses for them and their closer families. These mla's and mp's have local rowdies support who are associated with different castes they set up their businesses across the cities and help politicians during elections, and in return, politicians help them in return. People just want one half bottle of beer and a 500 rupee note to vote for the particular party. Yav party jasthi rokka kodutho avrige vote!

Those have already left the region and found the job elsewhere will rarely visit whenever yella - amavasi or some laxmi pooja comes avrdu voting ille idru use ila antha yarru bandu vote hakkala deserving people elections gellala and power alli iroru avr community janake ond 5% help madhanga madi mast asthi madkotarre ,aste!There is huge demograhic change that is happening the cities of these regions in the last 3-4 years recently u people might have heard some gang operating from bidar doing murders and smuggling etc because nobody cares about anything here and people are even afraid to go to some of the areas in the cities.

youth who stay here are mostly illiterate who just want to fight with youth of other communities and vise verse.On every festive celebration their will huge dolby speakers carried on trucks and tractors and do dances in thousands.and all these arrangements we will done by local polticians yestu jasthi rokka hakki grand agi celebrate madtarro the best the politician for the youths!

* Citra or fork version: Citra Nightly

I just spent the better part of an hour getting the rom to work on Citra Nightly, I have the latest version to have come out before the nuke. Right now I can play other games just fine, no real issue but DQM is a stutter fest, especially in open areas it just skips and lags.

 Looking into it I've seen a few people with the issue from 4ish years ago and they had to downgrade to other versions of Citra, but I dont think thats an option anymore.

 Im not super well versed in emulators and roms, so if people can help just explain it to me like Im a baby, please."

Communications career path: gov’t contractor vs bank?,careerguidance,1i9grqp,2025-01-25 01:14:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1i9grqp/communications_career_path_govt_contractor_vs_bank/,Odd_Nectarine_2779,Advice,"I have a degree in Mass Communications and am pretty well versed in several areas (public relations, writing, editing, photography, design, event planning, broadcast, etc.) 

I was a communications specialist for a large non-profit for several years in a severely understaffed department, so became pretty multi-functional and autonomous. I rose through the ranks quickly and was good at what I did. I really enjoyed it but kind of hit my ceiling with that organization. So I took another job in a management role for a similar org. That situation ended up being pretty toxic and I burnt out after a couple years. I took a few months off, considered a total career change, but ultimately took a position as a communications specialist for a government contractor. 

I like the work, the pay is good, the people are great. It’s been ideal for helping me recover from my professional burn out and I feel like I have great work/life balance. But there isn’t much room to grow here either. I’ve only been here for about a year and a half, but I guess I just don’t see myself here for the next decade. I don’t know if this is the wise choice for the long run. I don’t want to limit my options by letting some of my other skills get rusty. And the whole contractor gig feels unstable. 

There’s a Marketing and Communications opportunity at a local bank that would be similar to what I was doing before. While I’m not super crazy about returning to that kind of grind, I wonder if it’s the better path in the long run? Banking seems a little more prestigious and might help with future opportunities more than being a gov’t contractor, but I’d love some insight. 

Thanks for bearing with my 2am ramblings.

My first ever super perfect 😭,SuperStarWAKEONE,1i9fao7,2025-01-24 23:43:25,24,0.96,3,https://i.redd.it/62lm81xqk2fe1.jpeg,Responsible-Comb3182,Achievement,Since I'm such a noob at this game I haven't had any super perfect even on other superstar games since I started playing superstar games last year. Even the easy mode I can't get sp. I tried to do easy mode on this song and my goal originally was to just get 3 perfect notes I didn't expect to get sp. Even though it's on easy mode I'm just so happy 🥺

Seeing as time flows through these realities, it should add 1 temporal dimension, making it 4D to 5D.

Multiverse (4D to 5D): In Sonic Prime, Sonic universe turns into the Shatterverse ([which is officially confirmed not to be part of the grander multiverse](https://youtu.be/XqWYwD4BAPg?si=5QBUjkOsax2ZL8TG)), [multiple dimensions](https://imgur.com/a/Axeck59) that are within a void, these [dimensions’ time flowing differently](https://imgur.com/a/1x06-bvlTIgf). So the void has to be 1 spatial dimension to contain everything. There Are several parallel worlds in the sonic multiverse (Sol dimension, Arabian Nights, Camelot, Chaotic Inferno, etc). With there likely being [an infinite number of worlds](https://youtu.be/CnnqXIGA_UQ?si=CSF0eSOU7ELPV0H0&t=198), making the baseline multiverse infinite 4D to 5D. 

Maginary World (5D to 6D). [A reality that Illumina dreamt of, containing all dreams from every dimension](https://imgur.com/a/maginaryworld-shuffle-vYAqFwQ).  Described as an[ infinite 4th dimensional spaces](https://imgur.com/a/4th-dimension-space-is-infinite-4d-xJyJgSC) with [even Lumina stating so](https://youtu.be/G9kbysXDjSo?t=1902). [Wishes also count as Dreams](https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:ShakeResounding/2-B_Maginaryworld#:~:text=How%20Do%20We%20Know%20Wishes/Desires%20Become%20Dreams%3F), meaning the Egg maze that [Eggman wished to trap Sonic](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/3/3b/Dr.Eggman%27smaze.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220228214002) in counts, which also has [4D constructs inside](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZQT7UW-yayg/YhxT5-l23iI/AAAAAAACbfk/DnWHjo7dKGUJ8Arkk_GArIDEvawiCZ_WACNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Sonic%2BThe%2BHedgehog%2B039%2B%25282021%2529%2B%2528Digital%2529%2B%2528AnHeroGold-Empire%2529-011.jpg). Seeing as time flows through these realities, it should add 1 temporal dimension, making it 5D to 6D. [Considering infinite possibilities ](https://youtu.be/CnnqXIGA_UQ?si=CSF0eSOU7ELPV0H0&t=198)in the multiverse, there are likely an infinite amount of dreams dreamt by an infinite amount of beings. This means it should have a +1 spatial dimension to contain everything.

Exception (6D to 7D). This is the location of the final boss fight in Sonic Rush, where the Egg Salamander was gonna make an Eggman land that [transcends dimensions](https://imgur.com/a/dream-eggmanland-QFhEULA), making it +1 spatial dimension. This could be swapped around with the Maginaryworld since it could also be argued as a dream and the Maginaryworld is 7D but it doesn’t change the cosmology size either way.

White Space (7D to 8D). A realm that [exists between realities](https://imgur.com/a/qzvEDLO) and as such should contain everything below. +1 spatial dimension.

The End of Time (8D to 9D). Sonic’s Hyper Timeline,[ is an infinite tunnel dimension](https://imgur.com/YFvVfA4) that contains all previous dimensions. So +1 temporal dimension

possibly 9D to 10D if you think that solaris transcend cosmology. End of the World (9D to 10D). This is where Super Sonic, Shadow and Silver fight Solaris, who is described as a super dimensional [being](https://youtu.be/BbfteiFFYkY?si=0ulzIpNXLBBsTbmH) [multiple](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bnDFNUcu0/maxresdefault.jpg) [times](https://imgur.com/QSaHKna), meaning it should transcend the cosmology by +1D.

conclusion the game sonic cosmology should be scale 8D to 9D possibly 10D if you think that solaris transcend cosmology

now for the Archie sonic cosmology :

important information: first important information : Archie sonic's multiverse was established long before the games did it where universes are called ""zones"". sonic shuffle happened in the ""prime zone""while sonic generations in a zone called ""in another time, in another place"" and solaris, time eater and maginaryworld is mentioned in Archie comics

Here the evidence :

[time eater](https://preview.redd.it/35ckq46ewkce1.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f94b9d7f8031bac2d0d7f2506110676a10d2bca) and [sonic generation](https://preview.redd.it/archie-generations-v0-x5pam66agi9a1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c0f58faad7daae4448e932de7f39b359093ae0f2)

[solaris](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvsbattles.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FSolaris_%2528Archie_Comics%2529&psig=AOvVaw2VYRUTXmakvcho0xnW2VzY&ust=1737845531655000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCOiDqJ65j4sDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)

[maginaryworld](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/e/ec/Archie_Maginaryworld.jpeg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20231003223452)

Zones (4D): These worlds are [endless](https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:ShakeResounding/Archie_Sonic_the_Hedgehog%27s_Cosmology_(Pre-SGW)?file=Alien_Planets_Archie.jpeg) and [infinite](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B7RCGcLiiHg/VtpxisUY_SI/AAAAAAAAJ_g/TcL7QogBxdo/s0-Ic42/RCO023.jpg) in size with there being an [infinite number of them](https://pm1.aminoapps.com/6919/86425ce91f325a6661519ee6f5008737045e123cr1-1040-1600v2_hq.jpg). Meaning it's 2-A.

Maginaryworld Zone(5D): It [houses all dreams](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/1588c4b7-a0fe-4bf8-bf1c-dc120240b26d/scale-to-width/755) which are described as [extradimensional worlds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/601c2b16-e0e6-43fe-8d58-aecb39bac74d/scale-to-width/755), meaning there are 4D Dreams, considering that Dreams come[ from other zones](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/1588c4b7-a0fe-4bf8-bf1c-dc120240b26d/scale-to-width/755)) in the multiverse (which would include an infinite number of people dreaming), the Maginaryworld should be 5-d in order to contain an infinite amount of dreams. 

Exception (6D):  This is the location of the final boss fight in Sonic Rush, a space large enough for the Egg Salamander to make an Eggman land that [transcends dimensions](https://imgur.com/a/dream-eggmanland-QFhEULA), making it +1 spatial as it transcends the Maginaryworld Zone.

Cosmic Interstate (7D): Exists between [all Zones ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/4c6d0a2f-6eeb-4678-9e63-51fa158f0b0d/scale-to-width/755)and contains No Zone which[ runs perpendicular to other Zones](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/f4c66b63-3608-4887-9c87-e82bbaada070/scale-to-width/755), meaning it has another axis and thus is 7D.

White Space (8D). A realm that [exists between realities](https://imgur.com/a/qzvEDLO) and as such should contain everything below. +1 spatial dimension.

The End of Time (9D). Sonic’s Hypertimeline,[ is an infinite tunnel dimension](https://imgur.com/YFvVfA4) that contains everything below it. +1 temporal dimension

The Next Evolution (10D).[ A higher plane of existence](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/e58e8c88-ac94-4734-91ec-4366dedc14b6/scale-to-width/755) which is [above the Mortal plane and beneath the Chaos Force.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dc7ec73b-d1a9-40a7-be93-4a3450b47121/scale-to-width/755) This acts as an afterlife for the brotherhood of guardians.

The Chaos Force (11D). Source of all chaos energy. Encompasses all the lower Planes,  [exist everywhere](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/8/81/082CB5EB-44EF-4547-9E60-5AA915CA15A0.jpeg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20181106200240). It’s also [outside space-time entirely](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/0/04/66A77DD9-66BE-449D-921A-B99CEBD350C9.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20190219083058). 

The Source of All (12D) is essentially everything in existence, responsible for the[ creation of the Prime universe ](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/75/0c/0b/750c0b6f94adecf8c2d029bc3d793c67.jpg)and by extension [the infinite multiverse that comes from the Prime Universe](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/all-fiction-battles/images/a/a0/Zones_deviated_from_Mobius_Prime.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20210704152519). [Can manipulate the Chaos Force](https://imgur.com/kL3tJgf), meaning that “everything” should also apply to the Chaos Force.

Off Panel (13D) Views [everything below as fiction](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/b/bf/STH278OffPanel.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20161019135207), be it [the comics and game](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/archiesonic/images/3/38/Offpanelsonicadventure2.png/revision/latest?cb=20100413095623)

possibly 14D if you think that solaris transcend game cosmology

End of the World (10D). This is where Super Sonic, Shadow and Silver fight Solaris, who is described as a super dimensional [being](https://youtu.be/BbfteiFFYkY?si=0ulzIpNXLBBsTbmH) [multiple](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bnDFNUcu0/maxresdefault.jpg) [times](https://imgur.com/QSaHKna), meaning it should transcend the cosmology by +1D.

then it will be like End of the world 10D > next evolution 11D > chaos force 12D > source of all 13D > off panel 14D

if you don't believe then the Archie verse is 13D

high hyperversal argument :

[you can maybe scale Archie sonic cosmology to high hyperversal if you agree this argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerScaling/comments/18u6cmz/the_definitve_scale_for_archie_sonic_and_cosmology/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

then the Archie vers scale 13D to maybe 14D possibly high hyperversal

  
Conclusion :

game sonic scale complexe multi 6D in safe to complexe multi 7D in high ball possibly complexe multi 9D to high complexe multi 10D if you think that solaris transcend cosmology

game silver, game shadow, solaris, the end : scale complexe multi 6D in safe to complexe multi 7D in high ball possibly complexe multi 9D to high complexe multi 10D just like game sonic

I recently got notified that I achieved a norm at a tournament and was super excited (nothing crazy just for category 2) but still thrilled since I’ve only played for like a year! Anyways I decided I should try and keep going for norms and I was looking up the USCF norms and titles rules in their pdf:

http://www.glicko.net/ratings/titles.pdf

But I realized it didn’t address the case if you were to go up against an unrated player. Does anyone know how this would work with their system? Any TD’s or titled players know or have had something like this happen? I just wonder because there’s always a chance you can verse an unrated player in a tourney. Thank you all!!"

SFF books coming in February 2025,Fantasy,1i909ne,2025-01-24 12:05:29,71,0.96,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i909ne/sff_books_coming_in_february_2025/,EmmalynRenato,,"SFF here means all speculative fiction (fantasy, science fiction, horror, alternate history, magical realism etc).

The following SFF books will be published in the U.S. in February 2025. Other countries may differ.

If you know of others, please add them as comments below. If I've made any mistakes, just let me know, and I'll fix them up.

The published book formats are included with each entry (mostly hardcover and/or trade paperback with the occasional ebook). This information is obtained from the isfdb website which lists one format type for each entry but mostly omits ebook entries. If it's a new hardcover and/or trade paperback book, it's very likely that an ebook is also coming out at the same time.

If you are using the Chrome browser, you might find the [Goodreads Right Click](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodreads-right-click/fbicpmopjallgdpklipffmihodimmcbe?hl=en) extension useful, to find out more information on books that you are interested in.

If you use old Reddit via the Chrome or Firefox desktop browsers, then
there is also a [small script](https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/Bingo-UX-scripts/blob/main/sff-books-coming-in/user-script.js) (that can be installed with
the Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey extension), that will replace book titles in this post, with Goodreads links. See also the [script folder directory](https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/Bingo-UX-scripts/tree/main/sff-books-coming-in) and the overall [README](https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/Bingo-UX-scripts) for more details. (Many thanks u/RheingoldRiver.)

Wordgirl vs Brightburn Fight Script Opinion,DeathBattleMatchups,1i8ufbp,2025-01-24 07:38:17,5,0.73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathBattleMatchups/comments/1i8ufbp/wordgirl_vs_brightburn_fight_script_opinion/,Final_Dragonfruit331,Misc,"I recently read the fight script for Wordgirl vs Brightburn made by u/DarthStrangelove, I has been trying to contact with user so I can share my opinion, but he hasn´t read my messages, so I decided to make this review post so he, and anyone else ´cause it would be nice, to see it, so, without further ado, let´s go, althought first I should clarify that i´m not so critic, so don´t worry, I would be very nice with it

But first, Spoiler Alert

**The Analysis**

Ok, i´m gonna be honest, between these analysis, I liked Wordgirl´s way more, Brightburn´s wasn´t so bad, it was genuiely interesting how they analized and theorized about this guy´s species, pretty cool, and the way it ended would give anyone chills, but I think Wordgirl´s analysis was just a tiny bit better, and I confess, it was all because of Wiz, I just thought it was kinda cute when he started getting attached to her, she grew on him, oh, like Sage did with Eggman, funny when you think about it like that. I also liked the fact that he made awareness that Wordgirl is the nicest fourth-wall breaker he has met, understandable, but yeah, a very neat analysis from both side, now let´s go with

**The Fight**

Honestly, I think this is can´t really be called just a fight, no in a offensive way, but what I mean it´s the fact that it goes more like a story, no complaining, in fact, the opposite, when can say all the good things we want about the latest episode, but you can´t tell me you don´t miss the story element from the oldest Death Battles, and this performed it very well, it´s interesting the fight take place after Wordgirl´s lastest episode, because it´s there when she was more vulnerable so Brightburn could start convincing her about humans being and they should rule them, and the development across it was pretty cool, I´ll mention some moments I liked the most or I think are the most worthy to talk about

First, when they started talking with each others in their human identity, I don´t know why but, looking back at it it feeled kinda like Light and L from Death Note, maybe it´s just me, I also liked when Wordgirl was trying to find out what´s Brightburn gimmick, considering she´s the kind of superhero who´s villain always has some kind of theme around them, which I pretty much liked, and when Wordgirl was trying to break the ice while Brightburn was or just silent or like ""THIS IS NOT A GAME!!!!!!"" it was kinda funny and interesting, that´s why I like silent character vs talk a lot character, specially because Wordgirl seems like the kind of character that Brightburn could have a good lot of banter, two kids that has to live under the pressure, Encanto pun/reference intended, of basically having the power to be their verses gods, just that one decided to go for the evil way and the other for the good way, you know? That latest it´s pretty Cole vs Alex-like, when you think about it, also, I need to mention one thing, in a moment where she uses her ice breathing like if she was kiss blowing, which was actually pretty... interesting, I don´t know but, it feeled like a shipping moment, weird, I know, but, it´s what I feeled it like, next, it´s when Brightburn started to actually feeled fun it was a pretty good moment, because it´s something he never felt before, Wordgirl also felt something she never felt before, human fear, I don´t remenber exactly when it was, but i´m pretty it was at one moment, also, I like that, with time, Wordgirl started becoming inmune to Brightburn´s fear manipulation, she´s surely taking note from Jack Skellington, the moment where each one has the possesion on each others ""Kryptonites"" they ended up deciding just getting rid of it, Goku would be proud, back to when Brightburn it´s having a more positive point of view of their fight like, just having fun, like two normal kids of their ages would, he still thinking about the conquest thing, seeing Wordgirl as a future sparring partnert, pretty interesting, also, the moment where he tries to convince her about the conquest thing feeled very Omni-Man and Invincible-like, which I really liked, and it was pretty wholesome when Wordgirl was trying to convince him to not conquest Earth and leave humanity alone, also, I need to talk about the moment where he used his heat vision to destroy earth, and the feat, because, I personally don´t buy it that much, it was just a drawing, not something he really did, if Gumball make a draw where destroy the multiverse it counts like a feat? Anyway, the lastest part of the fight was the most impactful one, I always thought this was a match-up that deserved a tragic death, and it performed it very well

**The Post-Analysis**

Not too much to say, I never cared to much about post-analysis in any fight or Death Battle, but yeah, it explained that had to be explained in a good way... move on

**The Conclusion**

This was pretty cool, the fight definetely buy me on the match-up, of course, they can have some better, like Brightburn could fight Homelander, I guess, while Wordgirl could fight Super Why, Invincible, and even Captain Underpants, it´s pretty much a good fight script, not too much to say, but definetely it´s really great, go check it out, I hope you guys have a good day, see you guys, next time"

Long time backer and trader here.

I've been forced to condense the store to only the rarer items due to an ongoing bug with Reddit's new UI that now prevents me from editing store pages for regular updates. If you're looking for a CCU or something specific, please feel free to ask. If you're hesitant on a price also feel free to ask. Many items are being sold on someone else's behalf as consignments so flexibility may vary.

Keep an eye out for ""**SALE**"" tags where the seller has decided to sell at a loss, sub-market value or extremely rare / limited items listed for less than market value.

***----------------------------------------------- ORDER PROCESS*** ***-------------------------------------------------***

You will need to provide your **Paypal email** for the invoice as well as *BOTH* your **RSI email & RSI name** that the item/s get sent to.

[P](https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010056868-Gift-a-Ship-or-Game-Package-to-a-friend)lease familiarize yourself with CiG's **gifting rules** & **ToS** on their website.

Please understand that some of these items come from buyback lists and ***prices are subject to change without my knowledge***. If this happens, I'll let you know, and we can reevaluate the transaction.

**Abbreviations:**

OC = ""Original Concept""

LTI = ""Lifetime Insurance""

SC = Star Citizen (MMO game)

SQ42 = Squadron 42 (Single Player game)

OBO = ""or best offer.""

OST = ""Official Soundtrack""

(Some abbreviations not listed here are account identifiers for consignment sales.)

Please understand that this is ""not"" my job, but I will respond as quickly as possible, usually within a 24hr period. Please allow a minimum of 24hrs for a response. Thanks for understanding!

If you're interested in anything or have any questions about items, transfers, CCU chaining or Star Citizen in general, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message. **Happy to talk about anything SC related!**

"Therapy was a success, such a win!",stepparents,1i8qrtl,2025-01-24 03:20:06,14,0.82,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1i8qrtl/therapy_was_a_success_such_a_win/,SpareAltruistic6483,Win!,"André months ago we got a call from BM saying SS11 does not want to come to our house anymore. Dad was only angry at him, only gave attention to his gf and his gf changed all the rules.

We were very shocked. Because SS always seemed happy to be with us. I didn’t live with my SO yet and usually made myself scarce. I changed no rules other than I didn’t want him to sleep in bed with us and have the room off limits.

SO was completely broken. I had a very sneaky suspicion she had been asking leading questions to get SS to say what she wanted to hear, or plant these feelings in him that dad only cared about me. Combined with the actual nervousness of change and a past girlfriend who was the epitome of an evil stepparent ( played nice but said mean stuff behind SO’s back to SS.  Called him a liar if he told his dad, who believe his gf like an idiot) 

I only saw one way out and that was therapy. BM was very startled and fought SO on it. I helped him communicate with her because I am very versed in Narcisme ( grew up with one). Together with the therapist we got her to sign a waiver.

Therapy worked. SO and SS got along way better.  We saw a drawing from the therapist, he made. He said these dark feelings left him and he felt lighter. 

Now here is a little schadefreude from my side. Yesterday they had the parent talk together with BM. First off I personally think this therapist is not great. I think it is super unfair to have this convo like this with divorced parents. I think she should have had a one on one and then have a summary about the things both parents need to change.

However the feedback was all for BM. How she has to stop co-sleeping as SS doesn’t want it anymore but he doesn’t want to hurt his mom. How SS is constantly managing her feelings. How he is exhausted of that. That she has to model better behavior ( she lied to the therapist once about why they couldn’t go). 

I am not surprised about any of this. Because I know narcissists better than I know myself. I already noticed he was used to feed her ego. 
But I also know they usually don’t change.

I do feel good about SS and SO. My mom was codependent and we lived in this house of stress and keeping my dad happy. I had to figure out the effects on me, by myself. I married my own narcissist who cheated on me and broke me. 

I know divorce is hard on kids. But at least I can show him how love looks like. How someone cares and respects his dad for who he is. 
That one house let’s him be himself. I wish my parents did that and my mom stood up for herself. 

SO made a whole point about telling the therapist and BM that I convinced him to do this and he is so happy with the results he sees. The fact SS said he looked forward to us living together and is not scare anymore was really nice…. However! I don’t like to be put in the bullseye like this. I was happy to work in the shadows. 
I hope she won’t set her ire on me … but I know she will. 

I am reading some books. I have give SO some books to read. When we both understand narcissism we might be able to curb the effects and manage BM. 

SO is also going into therapy himself. Not letting his own codependency seep into SS.

Very happy with the progress. I do hope SS does better than the both of us and doesn’t end up raising a child with a narcissist.

The dilemma of leaving Art,islam,1i8q9qo,2025-01-24 02:41:28,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1i8q9qo/the_dilemma_of_leaving_art/,doner_shawerma,Seeking Support,"Hello,

This has been on my mind, ever since I learned about the controversy of art ( drawing, comics, people, animals life) in Islam. I knew about that in 2019-2020? and the waves of opinions and absence of civilized, clear, and understanding is frustrating me.

I have read previous reddit posts about this matter, it got me confused even more. As a desperate mortal, who doesn't want to extent her misery in afterlife too.

I do digital illustrations, I am into drawing comics and willing to learn animation. I did study computer science and know how to program, but this market haven't been working in my favor and there are many red flags from in Islamic perspective if i were to work in a company that feasts on users' data, questionable banks transactions, or work an agency i am obliged to code or build apps for any brands with questionable business. In Lebanon, there isn't an Islamic friendly standards in corporate.  On the other hand, TBH, i hate working in CS fields, its the new blue-collar jobs in misogynistic environments that are unislamic as well. it isn't for me, i am intrested in game dev, did couple of games but i know the headache coming with it islamicaly :)) (music, characters, animations..etc)  
  
Moreover, the Islamic NGOs that i work with are Islamic in every aspect, except in paying fair salaries, on time, and without gender discrimination. But that's just anywhere, right? but what confuse is, these Islamic NGOs, who invite for Following Allah and his Messenger (PBUH) ,they commissioned me to do ""Super Hijabi"" comics, or a comic panel for a gift shop that exchanges gifts for how much verses a child memorized, and a logo of hijabi girl. These projects has people in it, directed to people like you and me to relate and interact with. A teacher i take halqa with told me it is ok, as long as your intentions isn't to compete with Allah, and the drawings are cartoony not hyper realistic.

My riziq is coming through drawing, i have hard time finding a job even in Graphic Design, many nights i pray Qiyam and ask Allah to give my rizq in the ways he likes to be, in the ways he is ok with, not explicitly mentioning how, but deep down i don't want to work nasty, soul draining jobs, Can't a man work from something he likes?? do all jobs have to be miserable to stay in the halal lane. and after these nights i got 3 drawing projects ( the giftshop panel, stylized portrait, and game art for a steam banner ( a girl with a witch hat that cooks telepathically :3 , all modest tho! )) and here i am confused even more.   
  
 I am literally seeking Allah's Guidance, and i get these projects. Not even much of money due to the inflation and the economic crisis we live in. but it is pocket money that i am **\*desperate\***  for. Are these my tests? waving goodbye to projects commissioned by people who understands the value of art and communication?

The only Halal job i got (that checks what people say) was being a Design and ICT teacher, doesn't involve teaching arts. i worked in an a prestigious international school that claims to be islamic and fear Allah in their employees, spoiler alert: they don't. Underpaid salary, Health withdrawal, psychological issues still suffering from, toothaches, unpaid overtime, toxic management, **classism** in addition to be teaching over 10 classes as a junior teacher. Wallah it was too much, i was paid 700$ for 12 months, all that either went to debt, house management,  paying my medical bills, emergency, and upgrading my clothes to modest ones. I have nothing saved.

That being said, i needed to vent off... i am currently registering in a WordPress workshops with a secular NGO. hoping to gain connections to find a job that pays me well and give me peace of mind even if had to work in misogynic environments and quit being a human being, the norm . Keeping drawing comics a hobby for myself i don't benefit from, but it will always ache my soul the forms of arts, is impassively forbidden, with all grew up with ( animatic shows, comics, stop motion..etc)  perhaps even based our personalities on and  what a baby first do while picking the pencil and paper. l

PS: drawing backgrounds and objects are fun and have potential for storytelling, but it will be eventually used to insert people in it even if i don't draw them myself."

>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man is a really good Spidey story.

>This take on Peter Parker is authentic and a great combination of comic & MCU lore. Ending eps are AWESOME.

>It doesn't reach the depths of X-Men '97 but it's one of Marvel Animations better entries, for sure.

[Erik Goldman (Formerly Fandom and IGN)](https://bsky.app/profile/theericgoldman.bsky.social/post/3lgho5hkgdc2m)

>I’ve seen all of Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man and it’s a blast. It both is inspired by (and has nods to) many great versions of this story yet also is able to create its own vibe. Love the energy, the stories are fun and it’s another reminder of what a perfect creation Spidey is.

[BigScreenLeaks (One Take News)](https://x.com/bigscreenleaks/status/1882639750374330555)

>\#YourFriendlyNeighborhoodSpiderMan is the freshest take we’ve seen on the web-head in…forever? It benefits so much from being free from the constraints of the Sacred Timeline, giving us one of my new favourite adaptations of the character. The writing of @ MrJeffTrammel and the fantastic voice performance of @ colmandomingo, who steals the show, elevate this to a new level of greatness. It pays homage to everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) that came before it, all while giving us something new. It’s spectacular from start finish! I’m so mad the second season isn’t here yet because I need more ASAP!

[POC Culture](https://www.instagram.com/pocculture/p/DFMkp-NRZJA/)

Notes - The Season Finale - Return of the Rozzi Part 2,Delphitrial,1i8pjp4,2025-01-24 01:48:42,26,0.93,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delphitrial/comments/1i8pjp4/notes_the_season_finale_return_of_the_rozzi_part_2/,kvol69,,"Continued from [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delphitrial/comments/1i8nxtc/notes_the_continuing_saga_return_of_the_rozzi/)

\- Rozzi points out that they don’t have a rule about surprise testimony in Indiana because it is a deposition state, and you have adequate evidence for impeachment if they start making up shit while they’re on the stand.

\- Ali asks whether, if a witness tells the prosecution something—presumably under the assumption that the prosecution was also surprised and didn't know Dr. Kohr was going to say that—and if the prosecution later admits that Dr. Kohr had informed them of this last week, would they still be obligated to disclose it to the defense under your discovery rules?

\- Rozzi says it’s arguable whether they would’ve had to disclose that, but it’s not exculpatory evidence.

\- Bob looks really amused and beams at Ali.

Ali interjects, “In my mind it is. After – in light of your motion today. And we won’t go into it too deeply because I know you can’t talk about it but I’ll just give my opinion of it...it is exculpatory because it’s helpful given that a third party confessed to unaliving the girls with that very same device.”

\- Rozzi says he won’t disagree with her, but he returns to the previous point and says that he’s not aware of any obligation the State would have to offer up that information up under those circumstances.

\- Ali points out that in Illinois, they are not a deposition state and different rules apply.

\- Rozzi interrupts her, saying the rules are slightly different for expert opinions, but he does not believe it’s an issue with fact-based testimony about what type of instrument could have been used in the commission of the crime, as opposed to what definitely did. He says as a general rule while taking depositions and during cross examination he asks expert witnesses to report any changes to their opinions. He draws attention to the fact that Ali is talking about exclusionary rules and Rozzi is speaking about how to effectively conduct a cross-examination when surprised.

\- Bob reminds Rozzi about his comment to Dr. Kohr about suggesting that any epiphany regarding possible murder weapons should have been shared or the report updated.

\- Rozzi recalls making the statement, but he thought it was more important that Dr. Kohr admitted he had met with the Prosecution two or three times between his deposition and his testimony at trial.

\- Ali says she wants to circle back to the breach of the crime scene because the chat has questions. She asks if members of the public took crime scene photos.

\- Rozzi says his recollection there may have been some photos taken by non-LE affiliated members of the search party.

\- Ali asks if he raised the issue in court.

\- Rozzi ignores the question and says he is not sure who might have taken photos, and he’s unclear if anyone was ever identified who would’ve had possession of the photos. He knows that LE identified an issue, and said they handled it. He said during that time he hadn’t known there were vans driving around and integrity issues with the investigation at such an early stage.

\- Ali repeats her question, and asks if any crime scene photos made it into trial, which were not produced via discovery.

\- Rozzi pauses for a moment and thinks, and then says he doesn’t recall that being the case.

\- Bob says at some point “they” (unclear who) were trying to make the comparison between the stolen leaked photos and some photos which had graphics draw on them, which were not documents the defense had ever possessed.

\- Rozzi chimes in and says, he remembers those being documents that Westerman was accused of taking.

\- Ali says “you guys leaked what you never touched” and is cut off because Rozzi becomes upset.

\- Rozzi remembers being on the stand and looking at the altered photos with the graphics, and testifying they were not work product from the defense team and he had never seen the photos before.

\- Bob takes over and repeats what Rozzi said on the stand, and then says he would like to steer the conversation toward the bullet cartridge evidence.

\- Ali stops and says she has more questions in the same vein. She would like to know more about false narratives put out or facilitated by the State, or State actors, or “leaks” that were flowing through State actors.

\- Rozzi says that’s a broad question best answered by Baldwin. The two things that stood out in his mind regarding leaks. One involved a YouTube bit. He pauses and asks if it’s okay to name the other channel.

\- They say it is.

\- He mentions a Gray Hughes video with some type an incriminating statement he struggles to recall.

\- Ali suggests that it might be the video where he emphasizes the importance of the van, and expected it to be a key detail in the future.

\- Rozzi remembers it is the 8 minute YouTube “special” Ali suggests and it was produced before the defense team had any information about a van. And he says he cannot remember the second thing which stood out to him.

\- Ali brings up one which Baldwin told them about where podcasters (MS) reached out directly to RA, and asked him about his wife, and the rumor about his lawyers refusing to allow him to enter a plea before the defense team was aware of any rumors.

\- Rozzi states “Some of that was covered in a closed hearing and I don’t think I’m going to talk about that because it’s not really part of the record and I really have to be kind of careful with that.”

\- Ali replies okay, and Rozzi apologizes.

\- She addresses Baldwin’s complaints about harsh treatment by Jerry Holeman and his attempts to arrest him. She then inquires whether Rozzi experienced anything similar or if individuals connected to the defense team or potential defense witnesses were subjected to similar treatment.

\- Rozzi says there is no doubt Baldwin was in the crosshairs and the intention was to arrest him, which he finds very irritating. He thinks it is ludicrous for anyone to believe he should’ve been arrested over what is “at best – was negligence. And it wasn’t even that. It was just, you know, it was an unusual circumstance that Westerman put all of us in.” He says he never felt he was targeted by Holeman, he was more concerned about what would happen if they were charged with contempt. He points out he practices in civil courts, and he was well aware of the judiciary's power when it came to contempt findings. He believes that in the state of Indiana, you can be tossed in the Clank for 180 straight days. He cites family concerns, and he knows at least one of his children understood that there was a possibility he would be jailed. The situation began to negatively impact his family.

\- Ali asks if Todd Click’s arrest was tied to his involvement in this case.

\- Rozzi says he doesn’t have any information either way regarding those allegations. He seems to recall the arrest being during trial.

\- Ali and Bob remind him Click’s arrest was just before trial.

\- Rozzi saysthey were so inundated with work and preparation that they were unable unable to look into Click’s arrest, and the situation with Prosecutor James Luttrell. With Luttrell, the appellate court found him to have committed misconduct and dishonesty. He begins to explain that they would have explored those issues further if they had more time.

\- Ali says she was shocked that he was still on as Prosecutor when a federal court has already submitted their findings about his violations.

\- Rozzi counters by saying that in all fairness, it was not a challenge the defense team raised. He is cut off by Ali.

\- She suggests the Bar or Prosecutor’s Office could have self-imposed punishment on Luttrell.

\- Rozzi says he knows there are a lot of people who hold conspiratorial beliefs about some of the of the dynamics in the Delphi case, and that’s fine because a lot of aspects of the case warrants that. He says he had a good working relationship with Luttrell, he never heard anything bad about him from anyone, and he was shocked when he heard of even a hint of improper behavior by Luttrell. He has no opinion about the violations, and found Luttrell to be honest and forthright in his dealings with Rozzi. He doesn't believe they spent much time considering or focusing on the accusations.

\- Bob mentions DD spent time on it, and had a whole live episode for on the subject.

\- Rozzi says he won’t tell them they’re wrong about Luttrell, but he’s not going to appear on the podcast to talk about things he’s not well-versed in.

\- The hosts agree that it’s a reasonable position.

\- Ali inquires about the cross-examination of Brian Olehy, who testified that no trail cameras captured evidence. She requests a detailed explanation of the efforts to locate trail cam footage, discrepancies in statements about the existence of trail cameras, and the subsequent discovery of trail cam data showing individuals near the crime scene—contradicting law enforcement’s claim that no one was present in the area.

\- Rozzi doesn’t remember the cross-examination. To the best of his knowledge, there was one or two trail cams in the general area. They were examined, there were some photos, but they were not of any significance. He suspects the absence of anything was of more significant than the photos recovered, but he confirms that there were trail cams in the area.

\- Bob chimes in by saying they know now based on the motion that was filed. He wants to switch gears to speak about the bullet, but instead talks about the juror who was intimidated by Rozzi. According to her, Rozzi was effective at neutralizing the bullet evidence despite Oberg being an impressive witness. But there have been some criticisms of the defense’s ballistic witness not conducting his own physical evaluation.

\- Rozzi says it was a strategic decision. He begins by saying “it has nothing to do”, and then remarks that “I don’t want to say that, it’s not fair.” He rephrases and says, “it’s not entirely driven by the idea that we were afraid that we would learn something that would be detrimental to the client.” Once they had researched the issue, had deposed the witnesses, and knew the strength and weaknesses of those pieces of evidence, there was no need to take it any further. He assumes there are listeners that hoped the defense team would go out and prove RA to be innocent. But he goes on to say if the defense had that burden, they would only be able to work on one or two cases annually. However, part of being a defense attorney is to focus on neutralizing or destroying the State’s key pieces of evidence, and to use a more measured and economical approach.

\- Ali points out that according to the one juror, he was effective and made the right calls.

\- Rozzi says it was comforting to hear the unspent round did not carry the case, but they may be prematurely calling it favorable to the defense without more juror feedback.

\- Bob says he’s not a genius (true), and not a toolmark analyst (also true), but he had trouble following Oberg’s testimony since she was telling the jury to disregard the pictures used to compare pieces of the bullet and rely on her conclusion regarding significant agreement in toolmark characteristics on the unspent round.

\- In Rozzi’s self-evaluation regarding Oberg’s testimony, he thinks he was too broad and could have been more focused and precise in his approach. He acknowledges that even for the ballistics experts, they were doing an unusual comparison between a bullet casing from a fired cartridge versus an unspent cartridge, andthere is a very small data set for those types of comparisons. He thinks he was too general in his approach because it was a novel circumstance.

\- Ali points out, if the appeal is successful and there is a retrial, the defense knows they need to have the ballistics expert physically examine the evidence, and use microscope technology. She also suggests that they provide headphones for all the jurors, as the audio is being evaluated by experts using headphones.

\- Rozzi indicates he’s interested to hear what other jurors have to say. He described the recovered cartridge as a piece of evidence that was super sexy, and says it prompted RA’s arrest. He thinks LE put much more weight on the bullet evidence while knowing little about the available methods or technology to analyze it. Over time everyone learned the bullet evidence was not as powerful as they initially believed. He believes that LE didn’t know jack shit about the bullet either. He discusses with the hosts how incredibly rare it is to have either firearm identification evidence or unspent shell casing evidence.

\- Ali comments that usually ballistics experts are presenting established science, and she observes the changing dynamic with the field no longer being an established science.

\- Bob remarks that phones and DNA are pivotal in criminal investigations now.

\- Rozzi replies that the next frontier is digital forensics, and he wants no part in it because it’s boring. He briefly talks about the case of *Winfield v. Illinois*, in which the initial judge ruled to bar the use of ballistics matching testimony, which had been presented to link a firearm to the crime. This decision was part of a broader effort to scrutinize the reliability of forensic methods in criminal trials, particularly firearm identification. He said that the decision serves as a nice template for defense teams. But recently the ruling was overturned by Judge Hooks. The reversal allows for the continued use of firearms forensics analysis, including toolmark identification.

\- Bob says he would like Rozzi to further explore some of the topics that the defense team discussed on their appearance with Lawyer Lee, starting with calling Kathy Allen to testify. He asks whether there was an intense discussion about the topic.

\- Rozzi is shaking his head no before Bob finishes the question. Then he confirms that his answer is no, adding there was nothing to gain by having her testify. He continues by pointing out no challenge put forth by the State as to RA’s actions in the hours and days after the girls went missing.

\- Ali offers that it might have been more significant to have the mom and sister testify about his normal behavior before leaving to go to the bridge.

\- Rozzi thinks it’s a valid point. He says he spent a good deal of time prepping to call her. There was a plan in place, but it was abandoned. But as the presentation of evidence became streamlined, he says the court “trimmed the fat off their operation.” He describes how they had very little latitude in terms of the types of evidence they were able to put forth, and the types of witnesses they could present. He cites Dr. Stuart Grassian, the expert who testified about solitary confinement and false confessions. He provided substantive evidence about how situations like RA’s unfold, but they were only allowed to discuss a small portion of his expertise on the subject.

\- Bob calls Grassian a fascinating witness and said he was able to explain complex concepts about memory formation and meta-memory where you also recall previous times that you remembered the memory and make a new memory by remembering it (Pepperidge Farm remembers).

\- Ali tells an anecdote about several witnesses testifying about what occurred in a video where they were seen with their backs to the incident. She was denied a memory expert by the judge in this case.

\- Rozzi returns to the topic of KA, and says there was little she could add and they were already concerned about including other elements of the defense. He asks the hosts for their feedback, as he thinks they did a poor job of humanizing their client, and it bothers him. Typically, a spouse testifies about everyday life with the defendant, their relationship, activities, family trips, etc. Then he says, “how he’s a goofy guy and HOW HE LIKED TO PAINT HIS FACE AND ACT LIKE A CLOWN OR WHATEVER.” CLOWN EMOJI. (This being said on a podcast with the son of John Wayne Gacy’s trial attorney somehow made it funnier.)

\- I paused due to a laughing fit.

\- Rozzi says those types of witnesses work in theory for a trial institute, but in the middle of an actual trial, you can be hammered with objections on the scope of your witness, and you’re not able to effectively educate the jury about your client. In those moments the jury will interpret your response negatively, as a lack of preparation or a sign of deceit.

\- Ali notes that it's easier to ask Rozzi questions than Baldwin because Baldwin tends to react emotionally, internalizing and personalizing the questions. She points out that one of the most compelling pieces of evidence was the photo of Brad Weber’s garage with the sticks. She explains that the jury might not have found the crime scene significant because the judge prohibited the defense team from highlighting its unusual nature. If she were responsible for RA’s defense, she would have carefully guided the jurors to scrutinize the crime scene and notice its peculiarities, suggesting that the sticks from Weber’s garage could be linked to those found on the victims’ bodies. Ali also reflects on a case her law firm handled involving a murdered child. She admits she couldn’t bear to look at the gruesome photos and recognizes that, as an experienced defense attorney, if she found the images repulsive, others who are less accustomed to violent scenes would likely be even more disturbed.

\- Rozzi calls attention to the fact the crime scene photos were displayed on a 55” TV in front of the jury.

\- Ali interrupts, pointing out that they may never have considered that there is something unusual and more beneath the surface than they initially perceived.

\- Rozzi doesn’t know how anyone could look at those photos and think the crime scene is not bizarre, and one thing really jumps out looking at the photos...

\- Ali finishes his sentence by saying “the similarity of the sticks.”

\- Rozzi says he doesn’t remember what the question was, but they missed an opportunity to marry those two pieces of evidence expressly and explicitly. He says that was never something they intended to do, but in hindsight something they should have done.

\- Rozzi and Bob talk at the same time, and Rozzi apologizes and continues.

\- He explains the defense team was in a precarious position, he commiserates with the host, who has been through similar experiences, and clarifies he’s not a renegade lawyer.

\- Ali finishes his sentence by saying he’s not interested in overstepping the judge’s explicit pretrial rulings.

\- Rozzi agrees, but explains he’s willing to go back into the corner, point at the judge from close range, and tell them how wrong they are. He has a short conversation with an imaginary judge, telling them, “just because you wear a robe doesn’t mean you know more than I do or that you’re going to run the show here because we’re all part of this event.” But when you’re on a case with pretrial rulings and a judge who had previously removed them as counsel, he felt the defense team was in a position where any misstep could result in serious consequences. He gives full credit to the Prosecutor for executing a strategy which placed the defense attorneys in a vulnerable position, leaving them with little room for error. And “some of it has nothing to do with a van, or a bullet, or…”

\- Ali interjects “truth or justice” while rolling her eyes.

\- The hosts laugh.

\- Rozzi does not laugh, but replies, “Exactly.” He tells them he appreciates the sentiment but the truth is that situations like the one they were in happens to many defense attorneys.

\- Bob talks over him to say it happens all over the country all the time.

\- Rozzi indicates he is aware it’s not a unique circumstance, and it has happened to others.

\- Ali points out they’ve been abundantly clear with their audience about how the scope and attention this case has brought magnifies and compounds everything about the proceedings.

\- Rozzi agrees everything is magnified in a case like this.

\- Bob discusses McLeland's strategy in the case, noting that he won’t ask Rozzi to speak, so he will speak on his behalf. When it comes to excluding third-party culpability evidence, Bob insinuates Judge Gull was nearly overt in signaling to the prosecution, implying that they should file a motion to exclude.

\- Ali drops her jaw and opens her eyes wide like she’s stunned and then says “Obviously. Blatantly.”

\- Rozzi nods and agrees the timing is hard to ignore being a professional.

\- Ali says it was overt in her eyes. She also points out from the juror interview she learned the questionnaires which contained questions about Odinism were mailed out prior to the judge ruling to exclude the third-party defense. She asserts this compounds the prejudice of Judge Gull who also forbade mention of Odinism, and it limited how much the defense was able to attack the investigation. She goes to give an example, and Rozzi cuts her off.

\- He says the burden shifted. Ali agrees it did. He continues by explaining the biggest sin for anyone officiating a trial is to burden shift because it strips the defense of the ability to point to anybody else. So they were left with the high burden of trying to exonerate your own client, and they had to attempt to prove RA was not guilty. It is his opinion that the path the State chose to limit third-party evidence, although effective, is likely what the appellate courts will determine to be the primary issue.

\- Ali says she believes it too, and thinks the juror questionnaires compounded the prejudice.

\- Rozzi asks if his recollection of the juror’s transcript is correct, where she commented about knowing other information or suggested that she was aware of other suspects.

\- Bob repeats what Ali said about the mention of Odinism in the juror’s questionnaire.

\- Rozzi says he recalls putting it together.

\- Bob discusses the third-party culprit motion, noting the judge informed the team about the juror questionnaires being sent out—600 in total—before she made a ruling on the motion. He suggests that by sending the questionnaires out ahead of time, the judge may have set the stage for potential juror bias. Additionally, they point out that in Indiana, it’s almost impossible for jurors not to be aware of the Delphi, which could further influence their impartiality.

\- Rozzi adds the potential jurors were socializing and discussing the case before they are impaneled and sequestered.

\- Ali asks for his response about the juror interview, and is very theatrical and mocking as she lists off points she would like Rozzi to address. She claims the juror said she was so terrified of Richard Allen she was even afraid of being in the same courtroom as him. She underscored discussions surrounding the so-called 'staring contest,' the obsessive focus about the look in RA’s eyes, and the deliberate effort by some jurors to maintain eye contact until he broke it. She questions whether jurors were even allowed to discuss any of those subjects.

\- Rozzi clarifies if she means during the deliberations.

\- Both hosts reply they mean during the trial.

\- Rozzi points out the Indiana rules state they can discuss the case if they’re all together and they’re reminded of the rule every time they had a break, so they were probably permitted. Rozzi asks if that information was in the transcript from the juror.

\- Ali replies, “Yes.”

\- Rozzi remembers some of those details, and the juror addressing his eye-rolling or RA’s intense look. He doesn’t remember the juror talking about being scared, and he makes an expression that could be described as halfway between skepticism and outright doubt.

\- Ali says, “Yes.”

\- Bob says, “Oh, yeah.”

\- Rozzi continues with an intense, piercing glare.

\- Ali says she believes she’s remembering it correctly, recalling that the juror mentioned it was difficult to sit in a courtroom with RA. However, she hesitates and acknowledges she might be misusing the word 'scared,' that the juror may not have said. She mentions she might revisit that section of the transcript. Nonetheless, she insists that there was definitely something along those lines, and she is certain there was mention of some jurors staring down RA, which was openly discussed.

\- Rozzi keeps the same expression, says nothing, picks up a pen and writes something down.

\- Ali says listeners are asking about the legal ramifications of the jury breaking into groups, with the undecided jurors being outnumbered by those who believe in RA’s guilt. She explained earlier in the day she doesn’t believe it’s an issue, but wants his opinion.

\- Rozzi bites his pen and thinks for a moment, and then says he recalls reading that.

\- Ali asks if he sees any issue with the approach.

\- He says it’s permitted as long as they’re in the same room. It’s problematic if they empowered more than one foreman, but not if they break into subgroups while all confined in the same room. He says there are many scenarios where those subgroup dynamics occur during deliberations. What he says after this is inaudible because Ali interrupts.

\- She emphasizes the need to focus on the ratio of guilty voters to undecided jurors, suggesting the undecided jurors were treated differently, as they were placed in groups with the goal of convincing them of RA’s guilt.

\- Rozzi clarifies if he is being asked if there was some premeditation or manipulation in **how** the groups were divided up.

\- Ali confirms that this is what was indicated, reinforcing the implication.

\- Rozzi shrugs and says he doesn’t want to speculate because he doesn’t know anything about it. He suggests they should all talk to more jurors before drawing any conclusions.

\- Ali explains the post-trial process in Illinois, where defense attorneys are given jurors’ contact details in the event they would like to solicit feedback. She asks if Indiana has the same process.

\- Rozzi explains how this is the first case he’s ever been involved in where he didn’t know the jurors names. He usually refers to them by their last names. He says typically they have name and phone numbers, or he sees former jurors walk by his office because it’s located across the street from the courthouse.

\- Ali puts a viewer question up on the screen. It reads: “Does Rossi Know? Delphi Crime Scene VERY SIMILAR to UNSOLVED 2012 Iowa Murders lyric Cook (10) & Elizabeth Collins(8). Indiana obstruction of Iowa Case investigation by kicking out FBI & framing R.A.” (

\- Ali and Bob say they run after potential jurors, or occasionally bump into them in public.

\- Rozzi tells a story about his brother bringing a former juror to a date on a family outing, and she had to remind Rozzi she was juror the previous year.

\- Returning to the question, he says this case is the first time he was not offered up evidence of a juror’s name, which he finds strange. He says he practices in about 10/92 Indiana counties, so he has a limited sample size for drawing conclusions about jury practice. He contrasts this with Baldwin, who practices all over the state.

\- Ali says they’re ready to wrap up but a couple of listeners have asked about the Evansdale Murders being linked to Delphi. (Including the viewer question which has been up on the screen for the last two minutes) They’ve also been sent several messages about the case being linked to Delphi.

\- Rozzi writes something else down and says he’s making some notes. He recalls something about an Iowa case, but usually Matt Hoffman investigates those possible links and reports back.

\- Bob explains there was a documentary, about six months before the Delphi trial began, and Delphi is mentioned in the documentary. He goes on to say the Evansdale case is solved (IT’S NOT), the crime scene was similar to Delphi (UNTRUE. IT’S STILL AN ACTIVE UNSOLVED DOUBLE HOMICIDE CASE INVOLVING CHILDREN, THERE’S ALMOST NO DETAILS AVAILABLE), and the responsible party turned out to be a serial killer (F – F – S – S – T – I – L – L – A- N—U – N – S – O – L – V – E – D – C – A – S – E). He says he’ll send the details over to Rozzi.

\- Rozzi makes another note and says he’d be interested in looking at the documentary.

\- Bob notes they’ve reached the two hour mark, he compliments Rozzi, and thanks him for his time and fielding questions.

\- Bob hopes Rozzi has a chance to re-try the case, he thinks there are some strong issues on appeal.

\- Rozzi forms a cross with his index fingers and says “harmless error” twice.

\- They all laugh.

\- Rozzi asks them to tell the viewers there are two nasty words in their industry when it comes to appeals and they are “harmless error.” And they are always concerned about those determinations, and they’re certainly concerned about it in this case.

\- Ali begins to speak about limiting the entire ability of the defendant to present a defense, but Bob interrupts.

\- Bob refers to it as cutting the defense team’s legs out from under them.

\- Rozzi replies this is the reason he believes the third-party issue will be pivotal for a successful appeal. He then says, “One of the cool things about the case, to the extent it’s cool, I don’t know if that’s the right word anymore. Nothing’s cool about losing. One of the things that I’m appreciative of is that Mark Leeman was assigned to the appeal.” He explains how Leeman advocated for RA and the defense team in the Indiana Supreme Court, they’re friends, and his office is in close proximity to Rozzi’s. He goes on to explain the entire case file is at his office, so Leeman has ease of access to it, and he is pleased about the continuity moving into the next stage. He asks if they know Stacy Uliana.  
\- Bob nods his head to indicate he does.

\- Rozzi refers to her as one of the most highly respected appellate and trial lawyers that’s ever practiced in the state of Indiana.

\- Bob replies, “That’s who Cara Wieneke wanted.”

\- Rozzi says they’re very lucky to have had these two attorneys assigned to RA’s case. He jokes that if they can’t figure it out, then a successful appeal wasn’t meant to be.

\- Ali says then it will go the post-conviction route.

\- Rozzi says that in his mind, worst case scenario, it ends up in the Federal court system, where issues like the due process of RA’s detention and those circumstances, will likely have more traction than in Indiana. He compliments Leeman and Uliana for their understanding of the mentality of the justices and the environment in which they’ll litigate their case. He says he didn’t think any of those things mattered when he was in law school.

\- Ali says it’s good to hear RA is in such good hands.

\- Rozzi thanks them for all their support, and he’s grateful people are so interested, and particularly interested in fairness. He’s not interested in people who have rogue opinions because they hate the police or defense lawyers. But he is interested in people that are open-minded, interested in fairness, and understand people need to do their jobs to create outcomes to whatever side they’re on. “In this case, it’s Richard Allen, I believe in Richard’s innocence.” He reiterates how grateful he is for the support and how much it helps the defense team to work through challenging cases. He says, “It’s good to have a fanbase.” He thanks everyone again.

\- They exchange pleasantries and say goodbye.

\- Rozzi leaves.

\- Ali announces she will thank some viewers.

\- Bob says he’s going to argue with Gray Hughes on Court TV and departs.

\- Ali thanks new members, donors, and those gifting memberships. She reads off viewer comments.

\- She quickly skips one question about the defense having access to the vandalized camera on the south side of the bridge.

\- She reads a message from a viewer about RA’s in-processing at Westville.

\- Another viewer made a donation to say the Evansdale case is not solved, Ausbrook has the info, and the murdered girls were found in Indiana (not true).

\- The same viewer donates again to retract the statement, and says the victims in Evansdale were found in Iowa, not Indiana (true).

\- Closing remarks.

\- Ali tells everyone to go watch Bob and Hughes go at it on Court TV. She says she almost thinks Bob should have declined to appear at the same time as Hughes and rolls her eyes. But she explains she didn’t have time to think about it because she didn’t know it was happening and ends the episode.

My birthday is coming up soon and I’m thinking about buying 1 or 2 new colognes to treat myself. I’m not super well-versed in the fragrance department but I’ve started to dip my toes in this world more often. So, any recommendations?

I do enjoy somewhat sophisticated yet welcoming scents. I just want someone to smell me and smile haha. Some colognes that I’ve been looking into but haven’t smelled yet are:

- Tom Ford Ombré Leather
- Prada Black

I’m open to anything, thank you!!!"
I hate playing against my friends deck and don't know how to tell her,mtg,1i8mbjm,2025-01-23 22:33:57,0,0.48,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1i8mbjm/i_hate_playing_against_my_friends_deck_and_dont/,Iilmousey,I Need Help,"Me and a group of my friends play casual commander weekly. Recently one of my friends built a new deck which is a red white burn angels deck.

When she built it she said to me she was worried that it would be annoying to play against and hoped it wasn't. It's been a couple of weeks since then and tbh it's really annoying to play against.

It's so full of removal and targeted burn that it feels like everything I play just gets destroyed and I don't get to do anything. It's really anti fun. 
It's not that I think the deck is OP or anything, I just don't have fun versing it.

What makes it hard is she's a really good sport and super kind about everything. But I really just don't wanna play vs this deck anymore. I don't enjoy the games.
How do I break it to her that I don't like versing this deck and want her to play another one."

Cool and some impressive benchmark improvements (especially with the new frame gen if you are ok with it). But as someone looking to upgrade from a 2070ti on a budget, I’m feeling more unsure if it’s worth waiting for the drop of the 50 series or not.
It’s unlikely any of the MSRP will hold true and if any of it will honestly offer a better, worth it upgrade over something like a 4070ti super which I’m also considering.
Tech gurus of Reddit who are more opinionated and well versed than I, what advice do you have for a guy who just wants to improve his gaming setup for QHD gaming? (Especially Monster Hunter Wilds). Is it too early to know? Or is it looking like it won’t be worth the extra cash?"
The story of my hospital roommate: Mr. Chao (stick to the end it might be worth the read),stories,1i8l9lp,2025-01-23 21:39:12,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i8l9lp/the_story_of_my_hospital_roommate_mr_chao_stick/,throwaway23557718,Story-related,"For context, 25M on day 4 of being admitted into overnight care at my local hospital. I won’t go into what I’m here for but I’ll say that I was here for the exact same thing back in August so I’m pretty comfortable and familiar with everything going on and have had my fair share of roommates throughout my stay.

My first time around my roommates were great. I met this super cool older guy who I had some great conversations with. He’s honestly the only roommate I remember from that stay although I think I had 1 or 2 more after he was released. If I can’t remember them then that most likely means that they were fine. So first experience was good.

This time around, I was bachelor on my first night and had the whole room to myself which was actually really nice for a hospital visit. I had the bathroom to myself and didn’t need to be bothered by nurses coming in and turning on the lights at 3/4am unless it was to provide care for me. So I enjoyed that.

The next day I thought I might be solo again but they informed me at around 10pm that I’d be getting a roommate which didn’t really bother me because I get that they need space and I had assumed that it was going to happen earlier anyway so the extra time being solo was appreciated.

When my roomie got here, he was an Italian fella that I’ll refer to as Mario (I didn’t catch his name). I had no problems with Mario, he got the hiccups and apologized to me which I thought was pretty funny and he seemed like a good guy we just didn’t chat much. He would ask a ton of questions and would frequently call in the nurses to continue asking what seemed like meaningless questions. He would also then call in another nurse and ask her the same questions that he had just asked to see if they would give him the same answers. Most of these questions weren’t even really medical based. He was just a very anxious guy that couldn’t really make up his mind but hey so am I so no hate there. The only complaint, and I can’t even really say it was a complaint, that I had about Mario was that about 15 minutes into his stay, the nurses left and he had asked me if the table next to my bed was his table. Now the table was kind of in the middle of both beds so this could be understood to a sense, but it had all of my things on it and the curtain was literally blocking his view of the table. I’m not sure how he even knew it was there. I wasn’t sure if this was an attempt to assert dominance or not. I told him “well it was my table up until about 15 minutes ago but if you need to use it please feel free”. He almost tried to strike a conversation afterwards but I was saved but the timing of a nurse walking in. Again, I am 25 and he was probably in his to late 50’s with a thick Italian accent so I’d imagine we would not have much in common and I was not about to strike up a conversation and get caught in that for the duration of my stay. I am Italian as well so no hate there it was just late and I wasn’t really interested in getting to know Mario on a deeper level. He was released the following day and peaked his head around the curtain before leaving and told me that he hoped that I got better soon which was most appreciated and I reciprocated and we went our separate ways.

ATLAS, I was solo bunking again. Me and the girls (the nurses) were going about our daily routine when someone on the hospital staff stopped in and said that they would be admitting another patient into my room. Me, nor the girls, knew exactly what we were going to get into. This new patient and my new roomie was none other than Mr. Chao.

Where to start with Mr. Chao. He was a Chinese man in his 60s that was on the smaller side. He was accompanied by his lovely wife who was actually very good to Chao. She was doing things that most people wouldn’t for her Chao, but we will get to that later.

There was a major thing that immediately stuck out to me within the 1st hour of Chao’s stay and his attempt to assert dominance upon my sanctuary. Chao had no shame in farting obnoxiously loud in front of whoever came into the room. I found it funny and strange at first but, this is a hospital and just assumed maybe he was here for stomach issues of sorts. His wife, Ms. Chao, was also a gassy little bird. She was more keen on burping rather than letting out a fart like Chao. However, it was somewhat irritating me that I had to listen to this grown man playing 21 guns out of his asshole when I was on a no food/ no liquid diet. I was already irritated due to being nutrient deprived and his farts began to piss me off. If only I knew what would happen next.

Some time went by and Chao continued to assert his dominance over me by farting and speaking super loud mandarin with his wife at all times of day. The first night was somewhat smooth because I had requested sleeping medication and slept thru the noise. However, I don’t remember what time of day it was but I had heard a noise I hadn’t heard Chao make before. This noise was similar to his farts, but there was something else that he pulled out of his bag of tricks. The noise I heard was Chao taking a literal shit in the bucket our bed side supplies had came in. I believe the bucket is meant for vomit but I’m no doctor.

It was so appalling to me. I’m a young guy who thinks farts are funny and definitely have a wide acceptance of humor. If this was one of my friends I’d find it hilarious. But it was Chao, the man I’m battling for room dominance. And he was winning.

After hearing Chao defecate in much detail, I began to wonder exactly what was wrong with Chao that he couldn’t use the bathroom that is a literal 5 step distance away from his bed. I figured he might not be able to walk or had something serious going on. Going back to his wife being a ride or die, she was then taking the bucket of shit and dumping it into the shared bathroom. I don’t know how I was able to move by this without making a big deal of it but I’ve grown a lot as a person I guess and forgot about it pretty quickly. I didn’t even mention it to my group chat. Until….

He did it again!! Yup! Chao was right back at it not too long later. Maybe 45 minutes went by and Chao was back in the bucket. It was blowing my mind and I couldn’t see him so I was very curious as to how he was actually able to make this work. My curiosity was growing into intrigue. Maybe I was wrong about Chao. Maybe he was the alpha dog. At this point, I was forced to consult the group chat. However, there wasn’t much help to be found there, my friends and well versed and well traveled but neither I nor them could explain how Chao was pulling off these high grade stunts. 

Because this got way too long, I will just say that this continued throughout Chao’s stay. He would shit in a bucket and his wife would dump it out in the bathroom 5 feet away.

The reason I came to Reddit with this is because of what happened once Chao was released to the general public and the details that had unfolded. 

Upon Chao’s departure, there were many people stopping in to speak with him which gave me a wealth of insight on what exactly was going on with Chao upon due to the language barrier between him and the staff here. Due to the language barrier, the staff was using google translate or would call an interpreter over the phone to communicate with Chao which gave me the opportunity to hear exactly what was happening due to them needing to repeat their messages multiple times.

I should have mentioned before that I am in the surgical unit of the hospital so I had 2 keys assumptions at hand. Assumption 1 was stomach issues. Assumption 2 was that he might’ve had leg or hip surgery which is why the bucket shits were vital. 

It turns out, Chao wasn’t in there for stomach problems, or even mobility issues. He was here for cirrhosis of the liver from alcohol abuse. He was a partier this Chao and I can’t say I’m surprised. Nonetheless, after these details became apparent, my focus went to assumption 2 however slightly revised that he just had general mobility issues instead of surgery performed. Oh boy was I in for a humbling experience. 

When it was time to go, Chao’s daughter (the only family member of Chao who could speak English and a major key to the story of Chao) came to pick him up while he wife was also there. Once Chao’s daughter had arrived, they spoke with nurses for a couple of minutes before they said to Chao “Ok Mr. Chao, it’s time to go!”. At this point Chao shot right up from his bed, nimble as could be. This guy was light on his feet, and had more mobility than I did now. He got dressed while conversation continued. I sat there in disbelief. If Chao was really this mobile alcoholic, how and why would he elect to shit in his provided supplies bucket? I immediately started to question everything that I had assumed about the one they call Chao.

I swear to god what happened next and everything that has been written prior is 100% true. I only mention this because this is going to sound fake but it was words I actually heard spoken today. Before officially exiting the room, Chao’s daughter had asked if they could take Chao’s shit container home because supposedly he does this from his bed at home as well and has been using the same container for over a year and it’d be nice to upgrade. The nursing staff let Chao do his thing and take his bucket home.

I was left dumbfounded at what I had experienced with Chao. To the point where I’ve spent almost an hour breaking this down for Reddit. I do not know why Chao decided to shit in his bucket instead of the bathroom 5 feet away. I do not know why his wife would enable this type of behavior by dumping it out for him. If anyone has read this far and says “he’s a hospital patient” or “he had to do what he had to do” I’m not buying it. He was an alcoholic who decided to shit in a bucket next to a complete stranger with the door wide open facing the hallway now that I think of it.

To sum this up, I appreciate if anyone read this far. It was a good way to kill time while I’m stuck here. Everything you read is 100% true. I may have used my own adjectives for dramatic effect but it happened exactly as described. Overall, I think it was a positive experience for chao. He learned a couple words of English, released a fuck ton of gas, and got a few free meals in him while he was at it. He wasn’t my favorite roomie ever but he had some qualities that you really only see once in a decade, maybe once in a lifetime. Get well soon chao.

P.s. lay off the yinglings brother."

CKC today :),PreCervicalCancer,1i8jzeh,2025-01-23 20:34:15,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1i8jzeh/ckc_today/,Frequent_Sale3758,,"Well… I’m pleasantly surprised at the positive experience I had today with outpatient surgery. 

I am a highly anxious person when it comes to this stuff especially after overall medical trauma/PTSD with my son having health issues and post-Covid era so this was a big deal for me. 

It was so nice to have all of the staff anticipate my needs and I didn’t have to fight for what I needed, for once!!! No questions asked-The doctor prescribed pain meds. They gave me versed to help with the anxiety which was super helpful. I didn’t wake up from anesthesia emotional and crying like I have in the past. Idk what was different this time, but it went 1000x better than I could have ever imagined!!! We got dominos pizza on the way home 😂 slight nausea from the ride home but I’m in bed with my heating pad and all is good. 👍🏽 

(Only downside was not eating for 18 hours and they were running behind on starting the surgery so I was starving). 

I am praying for anyone else going through this!! I genuinely did not think it was going to be OK and that the whole world was ending for me because I was afraid of the unknown lol but it seriously was a breeze. Now just waiting on the results of course.

Goku vs DreamWorks verse (Movies + Tv shows) + bonus,PowerScaling,1i8ilbk,2025-01-23 19:27:11,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8ilbk,Charming-Bobcat-8144,Crossverse,"
Sequel to Goku vs Pixar but with DreamWorks instead

DreamWorks verse characters will have their feats from their respective franchises like Movies, Tv show including the Netflix ones and peacock ones, Video Games, comics, extended media, and if the character is based on a book or cartoon or game like Shrek or the bad guys add their feats from their source material too, and lastly no meme scaling like MLG Shrek or racism penguins 

For Goku, it's either Current anime Goku or Current manga Goku ( from dragon ball, z, daima, to super)  you could also add GT too. And no drip goku

Bonus: Big 3 vs DreamWorks verse, 
Naruto, Ichigo, and Luffy are all in their current state but you can put them in either their pre time skip or during a important arc in their series"
Tolkien Legendarium Chronological Reading Order,lotr,1i8i4tk,2025-01-23 19:05:50,0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1i8i4tk/tolkien_legendarium_chronological_reading_order/,Joellipopelli,Books,"Hello there, dear boys, girls and everyone in between!

So I‘m basically looking to take on a massive project, that’ll perhaps take this entire year to complete:
I really want to read all Middle Earth related writings by Tolkien in chronological order.
Mind you, I’m not super well versed in Tolkien‘s mythology, but I‘m also far from a newbie.
So I know what I‘m getting into and am very prepared (and excited) to read lots of unfinished stuff as well!

At this point, I‘ve seen the Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit Films, read The Hobbit a few years ago and read the LOTR books probably a decade ago.
I‘m aware of most of the lore contained within The Silmarillion, though I haven’t read it myself yet!

I also read The Fall of Númenor during a short hospital stay last summer.

I own most of the books(including Fall of Gondolin, Children of Hurin, etc.) already in either physical or audiobook format, but am of course not opposed to completing my collection!

I am committed to re-reading everything including The Fall of Númenor, even though I kinda just recently read it.

So if there’s anyone here who is willing to give me a detailed breakdown of what order to read all of the novels and individual stories, or can link me to a chronological overview, I‘d very much appreciate it!
I tried googling and either I‘m horrible at it, or my algorithm is fckd, because I couldn’t find comprehensive resources for this exact thing I‘m trying to do 😅

Thanks a lot in advance!

I’ll keep you posted on my reading progress, if people happen to be interested 💫"

Help! Trying to find obscure Future x Thug collab track 🚀,future,1i8hndn,2025-01-23 18:43:16,2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/future/comments/1i8hndn/help_trying_to_find_obscure_future_x_thug_collab/,lifehuntscythe1,Music,"It's NOT on Super Slimey or any Future/Young Thug albums or mixtapes.. it's off a random album with 20+ songs and just as many artists (not Superfly album, but that's the kind of project I think it is). The artwork for the mixtape/album kinda looks like colorful deep space nebula. I heard it on YouTube premium shuffle years ago but don't have the account anymore.. Might even be unreleased/lost media.

Ugh. It's a really odd, kinda futuristic song- from the production to the vibe, it sounds like they're playing a farewell concert on a space ship or something.

 Vibes are up tempo/uplifting similar to ""Relationship"" but toned down a notch, and the sound is very punchy and peculiar, almost like it was done in one take and not cleaned up in post. Thug sings a bit in his high pitched voice, has a verse, Pluto does the chorus and has a verse as well.. track is around 3 & a half minutes. Help me I need this song back!"
Comic Book Characters: A rant as messy as Earth-Prime or 616.,CharacterRant,1i8ev93,2025-01-23 16:40:40,19,0.88,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1i8ev93/comic_book_characters_a_rant_as_messy_as/,Emotive-Sneeze,Comics & Literature,"Oh… OH boy. Listen, I like comic books, I really like comic books. They typically have wonderful art and fun/interesting storylines with tons of superhero action all told through a smattering of awesome characters. But man, MAN, are they also a disaster of a medium, and it all has to do with how they handle their characters. When I say this, I’m saying the big two (Marvel/DC) in particular have become a black hole that is avoided like the plague by the masses, and if you happen to get sucked in you’re in, but complaining all the way. There’s so much wrong and I just wanna rant so buckle in if you care at all!



*(I will try to make this rant understandable to non-comic book fans, but that's a tall order so thar be dragons below and it be a long rant, ye be warned.)*

  


**FIRST: Catching up for newcomers is impossible. (Or at least annoying)**

Say you’re just some casual fan that wants to try and start reading comics, and that you’re a fan of Miles Morales. You saw the spider-verse movies and so now you wanna read some of his Spider-man comics. So you ask a friend who reads comics and told him you want to read his whole story, where should you start?



“Uh just start with this series, *Miles Morales: Spider-man 2019*. Sure there will be some stuff that won’t quite make sense but it’ll be-“

“No I want to read his origin, the story from the beginning you know?”

And then thy start sweating profusly because it's either start from some arbitrary point in their run... or you actually start from the beginning. Why is this so hard for comic book characters? Well...



You see, Miles wasn’t in the main universe originally. He first became Spider-man in a similar origin to the movie in the Ultimate Universe. The ultimate universe is a parallel world to the mainline comics where everyone is a lot more edgy by 2000s standards and in that universe there was a Peter Parker who was spider-man for about 159-ish issues before he dies and Miles takes over. Also Miles originally leans heavily on the supporting characters and villains of that run so you might want to check it out and maybe a fair amount of the original ultimate universe (Yes there’s a new one) to better understand what the hell is going on when Miles later joins some teams all with interesting backstories in said universe.

Oh but don’t worry, see, eventually there’s this event called *Secret Wars*, not to be confused with *Secret War* or *Secret Warps*, which ties things all together. See Doctor doom uses molecule man (don’t worry about it) to create a world he can control as god so he combines like dozens of different parallel worlds (don’t worry about it) including the ultimate universe so later on during the big fight Miles had a hamburger in his spider suit somehow and gives it to molecule man so he owes Miles a favor so when the event is undone Miles gets saved from them deleting the old ultimate universe, kinda sorta (don’t worry about it), and now he lives in the mainline continuity! Of course he kinda has the same origin… at least its implied but they don’t really go back over it and kinda make Peter and him reintroduce in a way they never had before and then he doesn’t have a solo for a while cause he’s with the avengers but THEN he gets that first solo serial in the mainline universe.



Like, seriously just glance online at the reading order and your head will spin from the sheer amount of wackiness you have to follow and jumping around you gotta do. It’s not like it’s even Marvel exclusive. Thanks to DC and their new 52 retcon and then the Rebirth sorta half un-retcon (DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT) there are countless characters whose past is just three question marks followed by “Just go off the old continuity and assume that’s canon again unless otherwise contradicted by writers who don’t care.” 



Wally West, Cassandra Cain, Donna Troy, ~~actually don't look into Diana either~~ the list goes on and on where there’s so much convolution and unnecessary reality warping nonsense that the only honest way I get through it is just ignore it unless otherwise stated and just go off the slow vibe accumulation from seeing them more and more.



Speaking of seeing them “more and more” by the way…



**SECOND: Good luck with seeing that character more. Lol, Lmao even.**



Unless you’re a fan of the most popular characters, odds are you’re going to be frustrated as hell as a comic book fan. Why? Because the big 2 (Marvel/DC) tend to love big numbers. Batman, Superman, Spider-man, THOSE characters bring in the big numbers. Could other characters gain such a crowd with good art, good writing, and time through enough issues? I mean yeah, probably, but who wants to waste the paper? 



Just to clarify, as of right now, Batman has **nearly 10** ongoing series, and they’re nice enough to let one be a super-man team up, two be different robin team ups, and another be a “one third of the book has random characters from DC have a brief story” type of team up. *Batman, Detective Comics, Batman and Robin, Batman and Robin year one, Batman the long Halloween, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, The Batman and Scooby-Doo Mysteries (VOL 3 BTW), and Batman/Superman: World's Finest*... and that's not even counting the technical spinoffs like Poison Ivy or Catwoman. 

  
My point is the big guys get a LOT of love.



One of the reasons comics are a good medium is that it’s not risky. It’s relatively cheap to make, at least compared to big budget movies. Maybe Hollywood won’t make a detective chimp movie but you could easily make a comic run… yet they usually don’t. The big characters get all the attention, and the others are lucky to get cameos in the big splash pages of the yearly big **event** that they’re pushing out this time.

  
MINI RANT PARAGRAPH ON ""EVENTS"" IGNORE IF YOU DON'T CARE

**“Oh woah, let me guess, old foes of the heroes are back, but this time they’re WAY stronger than before, or have some secret sauce that’s gonna disrupt everything like power dampener or making you a vampire, and the first few issues are gonna have everyone on the ropes before the heroes get their act together and satisfyingly decimate the villain, and now (If we're lucky) the status quo is exactly the same except there’s like, a handful of characters that are gonna be different for some time/new big bad for a bit”** 

*Blood Hunt, Absolute Power, War of the Realms, Night Terrors, Empyre*, etc etc....

(sorry mini rant over they just all have similar formulas.)



Ahem, anyway here’s an example of characters that have just been neglected; Wiccan and Hulking. They’re probably marvel’s best gay rep around. They first appeared in young avengers, and although they started as vaguely Hulk and Thor/Scarlet Witch analogues they grew into interesting arcs with their own personalities, powers and a cute romance. HOWEVER, they’ve been basically MIA for the past few years. Other than infinity comics just doing cutesy filler with them or a single oneshot, Wiccan will sporadically appear in the odd series of someone else for a few issues, while Hulkling only shows up to be like “yeah we’re married” then dips. Google their reading order online and it’s crazy how infrequently they appear, boiling down to a few cameos a year. Imagine you read them back in the 2000s, got super invested in their stories and love life, only to now see them as cameos to help out in one or two other character’s comic runs, or the rare importance in a crossover event that’s already swamped with cameos.



For the DC example, I gotta go with Wally West again. He was essentially replaced by a different Wallace West for a while when the universe reset, (DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT), then came back but in a “nobody remembers me because the universe deleted me” kinda way, then clawed his way back into existence, only for his first major role to be in the universally hated crossover where he’s essentially THE VILLAIN. ~~Heroes in Crisis was something alright~~. 



Point is, characters that aren’t the bread winners are often ignored, and even when they aren’t ignored, they run into the problem of…





**THIRD: Inconsistent writing. That's the punchline.**



Imagine you’re writing a story, and you have this character that you love. They’re a bit complicated, so sometimes they give off the wrong impression to other characters and even the readers, but you’re careful to skirt the line to write an interesting arc with a powerful end in sight. 



Now imagine that you work for a big company who owns the rights to this character, and a bunch of other characters, so in this temporary break in the story you’ve made, they want them to appear in a crossover. You have to let them, you read said crossover, and you're left baffled as your character just said “I love authoritarianism” and then just blew up an orphanage. Now they hot potatoed the character back to you, and you gotta continue on and figure out how in the **hell** you’re gonna make your story anything like you wanted.



I’m exaggerating, but not really. I think Red from Overly Sarcastic productions on YouTube says it best. I don’t remember the video, but I believe that she was reading a Thor run where she was loving every second of it, just for it to suddenly drop 50% in writing quality, change art styles, and begin an arc that just did not interest her. This happens, surprisingly often.



See with comic books, there’s dozens of writers, artists, and editors in charge of several different books. However, not every writer gets to control what book they’re going to write or when, and the same goes for the artists. If they’re lucky, then they’re considered “good” or the book is considered too important so they get to stay for a while longer, but it’s bo guarantee. Because of this, you can start a comic book series that you love with all your heart, only for it to change so drastically that it may as well be its own thing.



This problem also influences character consistency. For a while, Iron Man was DESPISED amongst comic book fans, specifically because of Civil War. They needed someone to be on the wrong side of the debate, and they decided he fit the bill. The entire book is filled with character assassinations, but Tony took the crown. People still rag on him for his terrible decisions years later, and like clockwork, the same thing happened again for Captain Marvel in Civil War II. 



Even if a run is perfect, with great characterization all around, it doesn’t matter. All it takes is a new writer who wants to take the character in a new direction or a writer who has a different understanding of a character to take over and suddenly this character you love so much is just… not there. There’s some parody of them running around using their name and you just have to endure it. If you ask their fans, reading All Star Batman is considered torture, while reading the Paul saga for Spider-man violates the Geneva convention. (I don’t think you should take it that seriously, mind you, but it is ridiculous just how inconsistent these characters can be.)





IN CONCLUSION

Again, I do like comic books a lot. PLEASE try and read *Batman/Superman: World’s finest*, read the Absolute branded DC comic runs and the new Ultimate Marvel comic line, read Chip Zadarsky’s Daredevil or Hickman’s Avengers, look up some older runs like Grant Morrison’s *JLA* and just read it on it’s own, universe status quo be damned because they can be worth it! It’s just, there are so many issues with the medium as a whole 



If you want to get into them, you can. Although it sounds convoluted, just read what you want, and I promise you with time you’ll learn half of what you need to by osmosis, and the rest you’ll end up reading yourself. **(Hell, a quick YouTube search for a rundown of bigger messes could help clear things up. It sucks that it comes down to that, but if you're totally lost there is no shame.)** I promise you’ll have fun, I’m just complaining as someone who reads too much, and have seen the cracks in this disaster of an industry. 



Editors forcing the status quo, authors not being able to stick to runs, juggling characters and artists, overusing big characters while underusing unknown characters, and overly long history which complicates everything are all issues that make it so frustrating. It’s great when it’s good, but it overall could be SO much better.

  
**TL:DR... Comic books are fun you should try them lol start anywhere no issues here :)**"

They talk take certain statements in series like gospel, like the Mach 3 naoya and make sure even Gojo can’t be faster. They flat out lie in other things as well. They took that one statement in a recent black clover chapter where yami “struggled” against light speed attacks (he didn’t, the person he was fighting just overwhelmed him and got him off balance) and cap the verse at ftl and ignore everything beforehand. But yet kratos is allowed immeasurable speed despite his million anti feats."

Returning player: what's a easy wally to farm up plat?,Warframe,1i8cjoj,2025-01-23 15:03:58,5,0.69,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i8cjoj/returning_player_whats_a_easy_wally_to_farm_up/,Honax_Xolbringer,Question/Request,"So I've played off and on since about 2015, but I'm still basically new to the game, relearning everything from scratch.

 My question is this: I currently just hit MR9 and have most of my starchart finished, what would be good farming methods to earn up plat? I'm so down currency wise I can't even afford slots atm, plus there's a few new bundles I've been eyeballing (nothing Prime resurgence wise, ik I can't afford any of those) more like cosmetic bundles or color palettes, but the main thing I'm trying to get is more slots to level MR.

If any vets or just well-versed in the ways of plat earning could give me any insight thatd be super helpful"
THE ULTIMATE FINISHING MOVE!!! (bonus points if they shout the name),TopCharacterTropes,1i8bwjb,2025-01-23 14:37:13,349,0.99,107,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8bwjb,ProfessorLovely,Powers,"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann — Giga Drill Break (my favorite)

Dragonball Z — Super Kamehameha (I know the difference between regular and super is mostly speculation but the Super Kamehameha is always a finisher)

Mucha Lucha — Pulverizing Pinball (I had a lot to choose from with this gem of a show so I went with Ricochet)

One-Punch Man — Consecutive Serious Punches (I’m not up-to-date on my OPM lore but I’m pretty sure nothing in his verse could survive it, making it a finishing move)"

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),indiegameswap,1i89pbt,2025-01-23 13:07:44,1,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1i89pbt/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,xiaolii,Trade,"**Last Updated List: 23/01/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

If you're reading this, there is a decently high chance you have a strong opinion on this album, or at the very least on the beyond controversial lead single ""I LUV IT"". There is an even more decently high chance the strong opinion in question is not one of the positive kind. So many things have been said about this album...worst pop album of the year, Charli XCX ripoff, inauthentic, camp classic, misunderstood, just okay, unlistenable, overhated. My opinion along this needle obviously leans in the direction of overhated and misunderstood or else I wouldn't be spending the time writing this. My hope is that wherever your opinion of this album and Camila in general lie, you can engage with this post thoughtfully and respectfully and, if you are of the ""it's unlistenable"" camp, might understand a little more why I and many others deem this a good album.

# Background

I'm sure everyone is quite familiar with Camila Cabello by this point, so I'm going to keep this section brief and C,XOXO focused rather than a career retrospective. Camila's career has of course been a massively successful one, but each era has been steadily declining in popularity. Sure each one has still had hits, but the difference between the performances of ""Havana"" from her debut and ""Bam Bam"" from her prior album ""Familia"" is quite clear. So what do many pop artists do when interest starts to dwindle? Reinvent themself of course! And that's exactly what Camila set out to do with C,XOXO.

Prior to the era kicking off, Camila left her longtime record label Epic Records and signed to Universal's Interscope Records. She expressed her desire in interviews for a fresh start and to rekindle her love of songwriting and reconnect with her favorite artists and references. She'd entered a new era of her artistry and to communicate that change to the masses she [dyed her hair platinum blonde](https://people.com/thmb/RYULY0kGA4sG9Pxse0OT7zVlAfU=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(753x164:755x166):format(webp)/camila-cabello-studio-030624-3aa743ba19f14132917998322ed79b52.jpg). A drastic hair change to signal a new era? I think I've seen this film before...

Camila described the concept behind this album as being ""the sound of Miami"". She described the energy she wanted it to evoke as ""messy and chaotic"". Instead of pulling solely from her Latin heritage and influences as she often had done in the past, she decided to try and portray her Miami roots as a whole. About her city she said, ""Being from Miami, it does feel like its own nationality. It’s the only place that feels like home, and the only place that I feel like can take all of me. Miami’s the only place that understands all of us."" She set out to replicate what it felt like for her going out with her friends and driving around with the top down, radio blasting, all different kinds of music surrounding her from hip-hop to reggaeton to pop to club music. To achieve this sound, Camila enlisted El Guincho (notable for his work producing for Rosalía and FKA twigs) and hip-hop producer Jasper Harris, who both produced the entirety of the record. She took a new approach and kept the collaborative circle quite small compared to past projects, and wrote all of the lyrics and main melodies on the album herself. What resulted was certainly a stranger and riskier mainstream pop album and rollout than you'd normally see from a major label pop artist like her.

#The Album

##[I LUV IT I LUV IT I LUV IT I LUV IT I LUV IT I LUV IT I LUV IT](https://youtu.be/rDG-6Ue_Qbw?si=8V8ZBbMScKqVRDYc)

Where to even begin with this song. I LUV IT served as the first taste of C,XOXO with Camila posting a snippet of the infamous hook with her (learning nothing from Hereditary) leaning backwards out of a moving car to it. The snippet spread like wildfire, with most not taking to it kindly. Even I was one of these naysayers at first. This snippet is also when the Charli XCX comparisons that have plagued the C,XOXO era started, with Charli herself fueling them by [posting a TikTok of her in her car to ""I Got It""](https://www.tiktok.com/@charlixcx/video/7343656267908435232) simply captioning the post with ""lol"". Camila's [prior teaser](https://x.com/Camila_Cabello/status/1753132037026861070) in full how i'm feeling now cosplay to a (never released) hyperpop-sounding song snippet did not help either. 

All of this built up to what is easily one of the most controversial lead singles from a pop girl in recent memory. Lots of people do love it, but even more hated it and have dubbed it one of the worst songs of 2024. Me? I think it's one of the best songs of the year and it was my second most played as well. I had never really cared that much about Camila prior to this era, so her having one of my favorite tracks of the year wasn't anywhere close to being on my bingo card. The verses start with a futuristic synth line and Camila delivering breathy, sensual vocals and lots of ""ou!"" ad libs accompanying them. It has this surreal quality to it that leads to what is one of the most infectious hooks I've heard in a long time. Camila's robotic ""I LUV IT"" chant over the pulsating jersey beat snuck its way deep into my brain and refused to leave. The background is *chaotic* and then the interpolation of Gucci Mane's ""Lemonade"" that follows is another baffling yet inspired choice that beautifully adds to the chaos. Even more baffling is a nearly indecipherable feature from Playboi Carti, who closes out the song sounding like he's on the verge of a seizure. All of these pieces somehow come together and create a dizzying, abrasive, confusing, avant-garde pop masterpiece and its genius is a hill I will die on. This song is truly one of the craziest lead singles I've seen a pop girl go with, and if nothing else this song is a risk that I respect. I also have to mention what is one of the most name-drawn-from-a-hat moments of 2024 and link [Lana del Rey performing this with Camila at Coachella](https://www.tiktok.com/@ricardogroupie/video/7365613894083153195). Absolutely ridiculous performance in every way, I loved it. She also did a [quite excellent performance on Jimmy Fallon](https://youtu.be/_p5RupAKUKw?si=yNVXe3igmAUchlhz) complete with blindfolds and robot dogs. However, despite all of this promotion the song debuted and peaked at number 81 on the Hot 100 and was Camila's least successful lead single to date. This was also the only song from the album to appear on the chart.

So...is the song copying Charli? I really don't think so. The comparisons are quite overstated and unfair, and I really just can't take anyone seriously who is whole-heartedly claiming this to be a Charli ripoff. Charli has never made a jersey drill song and the electropop elements of it, while hyperpop-esque, don't evoke Charli enough to warrant the plagiarism accusations. She did not invent synths or autotune. Sure, the chorus does evoke ""I Got It"", but it also evokes ""Cockiness (I Love It)"" by Rihanna so is anything here really substantial enough to say it's a copy? It's a surface level similarity at most. It's influence leans much more hip-hop than hyperpop. This discussion has continued to plague mention of this album and led to people labeling C,XOXO as a whole as a Charli knockoff, which anyone who has listened can tell you is just not true in the slightest. As [Mic the Snare accurately pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0tS8rGt9XA), if there is any sonic point of reference to be made for C,XOXO it's Rosalía, especially with them working with the same producer. I won't harp on this aspect of the album anymore, but I truly believe any discourse concerning Camila copying Charli is pretty baseless and untrue, outside of a few aesthetic choices throughout the era (and that snippet that ended up never being released anyways).

## [HE KNOWS](https://youtu.be/wuP0RP0VACw?si=NG_Ll069akSVnvMD)

The second single of C,XOXO was originally supposed to be ""HOT UPTOWN"" featuring Drake. However, due to a certain beef you may have heard about's unfortunate timing, those plans were of course derailed and a new choice was made. So, Camila pivoted to releasing this collaboration with Lil Nas X, which I think was a good choice all things considered. A club-ready banger, HE KNOWS draws inspiration from Afrobeats and R&B, with Camila singing over a hypnotic sample of Ojerime's ""Give It Up 2 ME"". C,XOXO has quite a few brilliant sample uses, and this is one of them. She employs it so perfectly and it adds so much to the song without relying on it too heavily. Everything about the song is incredibly catchy and well-produced, and Nas is a great addition, providing the additional oomph the song needed to push it fully into hit status. His contributions to the outro are my favorite moment of the song, you can't help but go ""BA BA BA BA BA BA BAOWWW"" right along with him. This song is definitely the 'hit that got away of the album', I really wish it got more attention as this was made to dominate the radio waves.

## [Chanel No. 5](https://youtu.be/XZ0li1ek9CM?si=0EcpjSCUcvhElAqH)

This is definitely the most experimental and out there track off C,XOXO and quite an odd choice of prerelease single. The song opens with an extremely autotuned Camila almost slurring her words as an out of tune piano sample comes in introducing the song. From there the song switches a lot, with the chorus evoking a more traditional alt pop moment except with the autotune, the broken sounding piano, and some vocal samples scattered about. Camila even begins to sort of rap at one point declaring, ""I'm a dog, woof woof"". This song is truly bizarre and is trying to do a lot of things at once. I really did not know what to make of it at first. After a few listens, I found that I kinda lived for it? I can't exactly put into words why it works for me, but it just does and really scratches a part of my brain; I think this song is super cool. The ""Wrist wrist spritz spritz make him come alive. Ahhhhhhhh...Chanel No. 5"" especially is some incredibly catchy songwriting. This isn't one of my favorites on the album by any means, but it has grown to be one I not only don't skip but have sought out on its own a few times as well.

# The Album

After the three prereleases, C,XOXO came out on June 28, 2024 to mixed reviews from both critics and the general public. The album debuted at #13 on the Billboard 200 with 36.5k units, becoming her first album to miss the top 10. Because of the singles, for the first time ever I was very much anticipating a Camila Cabello album. The album thankfully did not disappoint, despite a few criticisms I'll get into later. 

The first new song of the album, **pink xoxo**, features vocals from the iconic PinkPantheress in what (disappointingly) turns out to just be an interlude. The sparkling production is stellar and left me wanting it to be a full song so badly. There were rumors a full version would appear on the deluxe album but unfortunately this never came to fruition. On **Dade County Dreaming**, among the highlights of the album, the City Girls perform their last feature together as a duo. Functioning as both a catchy bad bitch anthem and dreamy ballad by the end, this song has quite a strange structure. After a buildup in the chorus, Camila shouts ""City Girls XOXO"" and JT and Yung Miami deliver fantastic verses littered with references to Miami. This song then devolves into what I can't describe as anything other than pure camp as JT instructs the audience on how to twerk over an emotional piano piece. Like much of this album it was made to be listened to on a summer night drive on full blast, windows down and sunroof open. Besides Dade County Dreaming, **B.O.A.T**. is definitely the highlight of the album for me. I am not usually one for ballads, especially a piano-driven one, but it is something truly special. This song is stunning and is one of the strongest of the album lyrically. She paints a visceral portrait of a breakup over gorgeous melodies and production. This leads to the most random sample of all time as an electronic instrumental of ""Hotel Room Service"" by Pitbull plays with some vocals from the song at points being included as well. I don't even know how someone makes a ballad like this and think, ""Yes, let's sample that"" but it somehow works so perfectly. It's so well done and one of my favorite sample uses of any song in recent memory.

**HOT UPTOWN**, the scrapped second single, would've been inescapable if it came out back in 2016. It's a fun tropical bop that harkens back to ""Views"" era Drake and I think if all of the drama with him didn't happen and this released in May as planned, it had a real shot at being a summer hit. After HOT UPTOWN, Drake wasn't done. For some reason, there is a solo Drake song following it called **Uuugly** that functions as a sort of interlude. The song itself isn't bad, but it feels extremely unnecessary to include here. I'm sure it seemed like a great move at the time of making it as an extra Drake song on your album would surely bring high numbers and attention but unfortunately we all know how that panned out. **DREAM-GIRLS** continues the party, as Camila does her own version of ""Shawty Is Da Shit"" by The-Dream and Fabolous. This song is a more standard moment from Camila and is a perfect pool party moment. It's incredibly catchy and easy to listen to and is a great addition to the record. **pretty when i cry** is another favorite of mine and the single that should've been. The afrobeats-tinged house production with chopped vocal samples interspersed throughout sounds incredibly fresh and has been one of the album cuts I've had most on repeat.  

**Twentysomethings** is one of the more vulnerable moments on the album with Camila reflecting on navigating a frenetic love in her early twenties. While a nice song on its own, I don't think it fully fits within the album. Going from HE KNOWS to this guitar-driven slow moment then turning the energy back up right away with Dade Country Dreaming provides a bit of a whiplash listening experience. Sure, the intent of the album was to feel chaotic and more akin to flipping through a radio station in Miami, but I still think it could've been placed on the tracklist differently or axed altogether. **June Gloom**, the closing track of the standard and a fan favorite, is one I like but am also not too terribly in love with. Lyrically it feels like a bit of a sister to ""Taste"" by Sabrina Carpenter, especially given what we know about their histories. She asks ""Does she get this wet for you, baby?"" as she wonders if her ex's new partner is giving him everything she did. It all leads to a big synth breakdown at the end that sounds straight out of a 2010's alt pop playlist. 

The album has two other interludes, koshi xoxo and 305tilidie. **koshi xoxo** has rapper BLP KOSHER talk about his love for Camila and how her music got him through his dog dying. A cute moment but perhaps would have been better kept in the voicemail folder on Camila's phone. **305tilidie** plays some clips of presumably Camila and her friends talking while out in Miami while a piano and some strings accompany it. It's pretty short and doesn't feel the most needed, but is still a nice transition from the upbeat songs into the ballad B.O.A.T..

The deluxe version of the album, ""C,XOXO (Magic City Edition)"", released a few months later with four new tracks. All four of these really should have been on the standard and there just be no deluxe; they're all quite good. **baby pink** has some crack in it. The hook is beyond infectious and is one of the most memorable choruses of the album. The feature detracts from it a bit for me, but is nowhere near enough to make me turn off the repeat button. **Come Show Me** continues with a similar sonic palette to baby pink and admittedly does feel like a deluxe song even though it still is good. **can friends kiss?** is a more dreamy, downtempo R&B moment that would have worked wonderfully placed in the back third of the album. The final song, **GODSPEED**, is an immediate discography highlight for Camila. She's wishing her lover farewell as they part their separate ways, the production building until it feels as if its collapsing in on itself with industrial elements crashing over the second verse. You get the sense that though she's wishing her ex well, she doesn't entirely mean it. It's the most cinematic sounding track off the album and functions as a perfect closing moment.

Overall, I think this is a great pop album and has some fantastic tracks. If I were to critique it, I definitely think my biggest complaint would be the sequencing. Some of the interludes/tracks could have gone and the deluxe songs should have been released on the standard to begin with. The entire product feels a bit too unfocused and I think a better tracklist would have aided the reception it got quite a bit. I edited my tracklist to be [this](https://imgur.com/a/93lRnuX) and I personally enjoy the album much more this way. Camila set out to make a Miami-inspired record that is chaotic but fun, vulnerable but cunty, and I think she achieved what she set out to do. I really hope she continues in this direction and doesn't let the reception and commercial performance of it scare her away from experimenting more. This album has plenty of haters and plenty of defenders, and I think this is a much better spot for her to be in than a universal ""meh...it's just okay."" Pitchfork described this in their review as being a ""transitional record mistakenly labeled as a statement album"" and I think that is a great observation and one that I hope turns out to be true for Camila. I think this is a fantastic pop album but I also think if she continues on this path, the best is yet to come.

Discussion Questions:

1. What did you think about the album? Did any tracks stand out for you?

2. Assuming all of the music was the same, what do you think could have been done differently to make the era more successful?

3. What do you hope to hear from Camila next? Do you think she should pivot once again or continue up this more eclectic alley?

4. A big critcism of this album is that it is ""ingenuine"", to which Camila replied, ""I wrote this whole album, and people are questioning my authenticity. It’s kind of like a trippy thing. Like, this came from my gut."" What are your thoughts on this? What about an album/artist do you think lets us know whether or not the artist behind it is being genuine and truly making music from their heart?"
Eutychus Falls Three Stories to his Death! Is Paul a Bore?,Eutychus,1i88ms9,2025-01-23 12:23:32,3,0.8,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1i88ms9/eutychus_falls_three_stories_to_his_death_is_paul/,truetomharley,Discussion,"The mid-week meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses are roving through the Book of Acts and Eutychus recently came up. He’s the kid that fell asleep during Paul’s talk and plunged three stories to his death! (Acts 20:9) He is also the namesake of the kingpin mod here. Says the Watchtower-published book, ‘Bearing Thorough Witness,’ “Paul could not rightly be blamed for the death of Eutychus. Still, he did not want the young man’s death to mar this important occasion or to stumble anyone spiritually.”

No. Can’t have that. It is not hard to envision the joke that might have dogged Paul thereafter throughout his entire life—along the lines of ‘Buckle up when that bore comes to town!’ And—let’s face it—you cannot read the account without wondering what sort of speaker Paul was. Was he a bore? There is a verse that suggests it. Paul acknowledges it of himself: “For they say: ‘His letters are weighty and forceful, but his presence in person is weak and his speech contemptible.’” (2 Corinthians 10:10)

Contemptible? At first glance one might think he admits to being a bore, but I think the answer lies elsewhere. I think it lies with the intellectuals hanging out in Athens, guys given to philosophy, who said of him: “What is it this chatterer would like to tell?” (Acts 17:18) The word literally means ‘seed-picker.’ It suggests a bird that picks up a seed here and poops it out there. I mean, where’s the respect? But that’s how that contemptuous lot was and it is from a similar lot as the “super-fine” apostles who so disparaged Paul at 2 Corinthians 11:5–guys envious of his position (but not his work), phonies, really. 

My guess is that they were contemptuous of Paul in that he did not follow their strict rules of philosophical logic. Today, it might be seen in the strict rules some have that everything be “evidence-based,” with their equally strict rules as to just what constitutes “evidence”—“anecdotal evidence” doesn’t count. I’ll bet Paul simply didn’t defer to equally manmade standards and they dissed him for it. 

It is another matter entirely with Tom Irregardless, from my first book, ‘Tom Irregardless and Me.’ Not only is he a horrifically bad speaker, but he says irregardless so often that Shem Sheepngoats has downloaded an app to keep track. When I bring my Bible student (Ted Putsch) to his first public talk—having carefully ascertained that the speaker will be a good one, that speaker calls in sick and Tom Irregardless is the substitute! I mutter under my breath why God hates my Bible student. But, as I slink into my seat, losing count after 17 irregardlesses, Ted weathers it well. After the meeting, he is seen chatting up several persons in the congregation, even exchanging a few words with Tom Irregardless. 

It is a gag drawn from long-ago memory. It would not happen today. The quality of public speakers has markedly improved through the decades and the worst you will ever do today is hear a speaker who is ‘adequate.’ Clunkers have long since been weeded out. One never hears a bad talk these days, and I am dating myself when I approach the elder I love to tease and tell him that I would be scared to deliver a really hard-hitting message but it might help if I had some practice—therefore, would he mind if I was the one to announce his public talks?

To so improve speakers is a significant accomplishment, for it is peers ‘policing themselves,’ something that is very difficult to do because you don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings—and you also worry that they may turn around and say your talks suck, too. But it has been done. The accomplishment means little to one used to the church model in which a paid preacher is employed and no one else has any role beyond listening. But, in an organization in which all are encouraged to both preach and teach, it is significant. I even think the local speakers are as good, sometimes better, than those on the app, with more spontanaity. But this might be just a personal preference for non-televised talks. "

Eco Systems - God's Seemingly Harsh Punishment,Quraniyoon,1i7z53d,2025-01-23 03:47:59,1,0.67,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quraniyoon/comments/1i7z53d/eco_systems_gods_seemingly_harsh_punishment/,MotorProfessional676,Research / Effort Post🔎,"Peace and God's blessings be with you.

When first reading the Quran I found God's detailing of punishments, specifically in this world, to people quite harsh and violent. I personally found it super confronting, and it was difficult to think that a God that is described as forgiving and merciful in the book would also be capable of such. This post serves to aid those who may be having the same thoughts, inshaAllah. 

How do humans deal with pests within an ecosystem? If a pest is destroying an ecosystem, while one can feel remorse for having to 'deal' with the pest, it is necessary for the wellbeing of the ecosystem and its inhabitants to 'deal' with the pest. In this same way, God orders for a just society within the ecosystem of us humans. When the pests are too far gone, they must be dealt with. When calling to reform does not work, they must be elimenated in order to preserve the sanctity and wellbeing of the habitat. The habitat is human society and the pests are the wrong doers. 

**Quran 9:5** says ""And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them \[go\] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.""

This to some might appear as unreasonably violent, and one can see how a person could come to this conclusion. A surface level reading might leave a person thinking ""why should people who simply have a different religion be murdered and violently pursued just because they have different beliefs?"". In reality, this verse isn't inciting senseless violence to combat other people's belief systems, it is actually a preservation of the eco system. How so?

**Quran 6:137** says ""Likewise, the pagans’ evil associates have made it appealing to them to kill their own children—only leading to their destruction as well as confusion in their faith. Had it been Allah’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their falsehood.""

This is just one example, but this verse along with **16:58-59, 6:140**, and others, describes that the polythiests addressed in **9:5** engaged in the murder of their own children as a result of their belief systems. A heinous act, no doubt. When reading **9:5** with this information in mind, the described killing and violent pursuit is no longer just about one's belief system, but it is actually ridding the pests of our human habitat. The pests which brutally murder their own off spring. As stated, child murder is just one example of the injustices that the pagan society engaged in. 

**Quran 2:50** says ""And ˹remember˺ when We parted the sea, rescued you, and drowned Pharaoh’s people before your very eyes."" 

Drowning seems like a pretty brutal way to die right? Well, yes, that's likely the point.

**Quran 28:4** says ""Indeed, Pharaoh ˹arrogantly˺ elevated himself in the land and divided its people into ˹subservient˺ groups, one of which he persecuted, slaughtering their sons and keeping their women. He was truly one of the corruptors.""

There are many more examples of the Pharaoh's tyranny no doubt, but we'll go with the theme of murder again. Why did God choose to eliminate Pharaoh in such a way? Well it doesn't seem like it was just for the state of his heart, but more that the state of his heart informed his actions in some pretty cruel works - slaughtering sons as seen in this verse. He is even described as one of the corruptors. Corrupting the human ecosystem. A pest that needed to be mitigated to preserve the sanctity of society. I think one can also infer what 'keeping their women' means without it being directly stated too, which I will use as a segue into the last example. 

**Quran 24:2** says ""As for female and male fornicators, give each of them one hundred lashes, and do not let pity for them make you lenient in ˹enforcing˺ the law of Allah, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a number of believers witness their punishment.""

I can totally see how one would see this as a harsh punishment. I also personally think that we can see what 'sexual liberation', or sex outside of the sanctity of marraige, has done in today's society. Including, but not limited to, non-expecting parents who are unprepared to give children just and satisfactory upbringings, abortion being used as a method of contraception following irresponsible sex by people uninterested in parenting, transmission of sexual diseases which can be debilitating and even fatal, often women, but also at times men, being lead on with hopes of romance and partnership just to be 'used' for sex (a huge emotional injustice in my eyes), and at the extreme end of this in terms of severity, rape.

I know rape falls into its own category of injustice obviously, but with the normalisation of sex outside of marriage, this opens the 'door of opportunity' up further for it to be committed. It becomes, instead of one ""option"" as a ""sexual prospect"" (please forgive the word choice) as is in marriage, in an offenders eyes that now anyone becomes a possible ""sexual prospect"". 

One hundred lashes is not punishment for the sake of punishment. I personally see this as a deterrent more than anything, especially with mention of ""and let a number of believers witness their punishment"", yet still definitely punitive in the case of transgression. It is about keeping the ecosystem in check, and deterring the the corruptive pests from infiltrating what is supposed to be a pure habitat - a pure human society free of injustice. 

Although a long post, this is actually a bite sized version of a much larger discussion with many more scriptural examples that can be appealed to. I know that to many the above will be common sense, but to those who are feeling similar as I once did regarding what seems like harshness and violence in God's book, I hope this provides some understanding as to why God's ordinance of harshness and punishment is necessary at times. It is actually harshness and punishment that comes from a place of mercy, compassion, and protection towards the habitat that is human society, and the inhabitants of the ecosystem, us humans. "
Unpopular Book Opinion,fantasyromance,1i7z1dh,2025-01-23 03:39:55,0,0.4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyromance/comments/1i7z1dh/unpopular_book_opinion/,Altruistic_Wash_7059,Discussion 💬,"Unpopular Book Opinion
No hate or rude comments 

I know not everyone is going to agree with me and that’s is okay, I just need to get this off my chest. 

Oynx Storm was released yesterday as everyone book baddie knows. I preordered my book back in March 2024 before it had a title. I stood in line in -4 weather for an hour, I was 7th in line. Didn’t get a book, went to a second target location stood in line again in -4 weather for another hour and got the last limited edition copy and a deluxe copy. I feel very blessed. The year before I waited in line for an hour and scored a holiday edition of Fourth Wing and first edition of Iron Flame. 
That being said I saw people yelling at employees who get paid slightly more than minimum wage. People claiming that this is so unfair, and that they should make enough for EVERYONE. Grown ass adult acting like spoiled children. I saw the worse of people and it really irk me. Then I got onto Facebook, and everyone in my local book groups were also complaining about how EVERYONE should get a book and can’t believe people were reselling etc. It gave such sore loser energy. 

I will start off by saying- I hate scalpers, going to buy all of a product for the intent of reselling for stupid price is awful. Example- books, concert tickets, toys, movies, music etc 

My father is a collector. He collects comic books, music, art and toys. Growing up, I went with my dad to hunt for certain albums and toys and it was just a thrill when we found something worth wild. My father is a very strict ‘don’t take it out of the box’ type of guy. And he is also the type of guy who will pay when it’s worth it. I am a book collector among other things. I always try to get first editions and special copies. I have some special editions of classics. Please don’t execute me when I say this, The Fourth Wing Series isn’t even particularly my favorite series ever, I just really enjoy collecting and adding to my library. If I had not gotten the books yesterday, I wouldn’t had been mad- I would had thought better luck next time or cross my fingers I would come across it one day at a decent price. Collecting is a skill, hobby and passion. I know all don’t understand and I know we shouldn’t care so much about materialism items but I just a person who really love my trinkets and treasures. I get a huge sense of pride and happiness from it. 

I have always been a huge reader my entire life. I went to a tiny school and had a rough childhood so naturally books were my escape and closest friend, they always have been. I went through my ugly wattpad phase and everything. Reading has always been of my greatest joys, even when it wasn’t as popular when phones and the internet started to gained traction. I am so so happy to see people are reading again and reading more. I know some people are very similar to me and never stopped and I welcome to the people we just started recently. No gatekeeping here. 

That being said - HERE is the unpopular opinion- if people have something special like a first edition they should be allowed to sell that book or thing for whatever price they want . Does that mean they will get that price- probably not. And timing plays a lot in this as well. 

I don’t agree with people going to the Oynx Storm release or other release days, buying a bunch of books for the intention of reselling the day of for hundreds of dollars. Timing is everything. Wait till it’s at least paperback or the regular hardbacks are in stock or something. But the beautiful thing about modern day society is there is a lot of resources to access books such as buying digital, buying used, libraries, audiobooks etc. I understand this is a new book so physical copies are not super accessible at the moment but will be. 

The people who have something special like the limited edition Oynx Storm or first edition of a Dr Seuss book or whatever it might be - it’s special, not everyone has it and there forth it’s worth more. It’s going to be sold for a higher price. I don’t think they should make so many copies so everyone gets it, it loses value and tends to get rushed and sloppily produced. 

A lot of these newer book collectors/ readers tend to have the mentality that everyone is entitled to the special limited edition book or album or whatever it might be and it really just gets under my skin. At that point, it’s not limited edition or special because everyone and their mother has it. I’m not sure if I’m going on about a niche subject or whatever. An example is downloading Pink Floyd’s The Wall on Spotify verse finding the original press 1979 vinyl. Everyone should be allowed access to this content since it’s reproduced for that intention but there’s a reason why there’s limited quantities of first editions and limited editions etc. I grew up in a toy collector’s world where there’s just usually one run and it’s done. An unboxed 1977 Millennium Falcon is most likely going to be more valuable than a 2025 Millennium falcon if you catch my drift. 

Today’s generation of book collectors are something else and I was horrified at what I witness yesterday. Not sure if I’m gonna get alot of hate for my unpopular opinion. The hunt is part of the fun of collecting. Collector culture is a lot of fun and you can meet really great and interesting people but it’s not mashing well with my generation/ newer book collectors/readers. At the end of the day, I guess it’s just stuff 🤷 "
Birthright Citizenship Executive Order Revocation,aznidentity,1i7xmst,2025-01-23 01:53:03,36,0.95,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/1i7xmst/birthright_citizenship_executive_order_revocation/,Alula_Australis,Politics,"I think pretty much everyone has seen the giant number of EOs Trump has carried out (fuck the revocation of remote work btw). I was curious to know what everyone's thoughts are on the revocation of birthright citizenship in regards to Asian Americans.

I also did a bit of poking around on the 'net but didn't seen much on the actual stats regarding the potential numbers of Asians that would be affected by different interpretations of the 14th amendment. So concrete numbers are super welcome!

I personally, am not well versed in the legalese of everything being spoken about, nor would I call myself very educated or up to date with the way citizenship works legally as well as what has been set by precedent and what is outside the bounds of the law. But I haven't seen anyone else post this so here it is I suppose.

My initial thoughts (being uninformed) are that it's good that it isn't retroactive. It's bad because regardless of the effect of the EO itself, it threatens the whole point of having congress exist and a balanced political system where no single branch has way too much power. Anyway what do y'all think?"
Looking to try something new to try to get this ball rolling,chaosmagick,1i7vyqp,2025-01-23 00:03:11,3,0.8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/chaosmagick/comments/1i7vyqp/looking_to_try_something_new_to_try_to_get_this/,JFK360noscope,,"Im not super well versed in magick despite researching and reading about it. Ive only done sigils, LBRP, middle pillar, breath work and visualization stuff. Typically, i do sigils and not much else because i rarely really feel the need to practice any magick with any urgency or need until now. 

Im looking for a job. Specifically in the field i am attending school for. I am almost finished and have been applying and haven't had luck moving past interviews. I did a sigil last month. While i dont want to say ""it didnt work"", i really want to do something effective and get it as fast as possible. Im extremely motivated to get started in the field, this is a big goal of mine. 

Is there any other rituals/practice or things i can do? I hear things about servitores but am cautious to not fuck something up as im relatively inexperienced. Ive been super busy with school so i haven't had time to research or read any magick books that could help me. What should i do or look into?

[Complete] [86k] [Middle-Grade Fantasy] Finley Maxwell and the Shadow Stalker,BetaReaders,1i7unbm,2025-01-22 22:48:33,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1i7unbm/complete_86k_middlegrade_fantasy_finley_maxwell/,RobJHulett,80k,"Hello! Thanks for taking the time, looking to connect with some people who are well versed in the MG world and who are willing to read my first 3 chapters... Wondering if they're just not connecting well enough... Here's a bit of a blurb below:

Finley Maxwell has always lived at Hathaway’s Orphanage, Morgue and Funeral Home where the director has always said that his parents abandoned him. On the morning of his eleventh birthday (his least favorite day of the year) Finley receives news that he is being adopted. When he meets the men who have come to take him, the quirky Barry and his stern brother Burley, Finley realizes everything he’s been told about his life is a lie. For starters he's seeing faces in the glass eye of the director of Hathaway's. Finley's ears grow a pointy tip due to him being an elf and he's told his parents went missing during a secret mission. Now Barry and Burley are taking Finley back to where he truly belongs — the magical realm of *Ethel.*

To hone his elven powers Finley must prove his worth at a rite of passage called the Sprouting and be enrolled in Woodworths Academy of Magic. While there Finley tries to find the answer that has eluded him his entire life: Why did his mum and dad disappear? But when magical creatures across Ethel begin to go missing, Finley discovers a conspiracy running deep through the Academy and that his family is entwined in something much more dangerous — the return of an ancient evil that could threaten the future of both the magical and human realms.

In his search for the truth, Finley will face vile hybrid monsters, hate for being raised by the round-ears (what magical beings call humans), and a prophecy that ties him to the return of this terrible evil. Though Finley is only just beginning to learn how to wield his magic, he knows it’s up to him to finish what his parents started.

Just looking for any and all feedback on how ""hooky"" the opening chapters are. Unfortunately I'm not super into anything other than MG at the moment, willing to help with that.

First page is also posted below:

Finley Maxwell hadn’t even finished breakfast and knew he was in trouble.

The uncomfortably familiar feeling of hot breath from the abnormally large and hairy enforcer, Mortimer, hitting his neck was what let Finley know. No doubt this was why every eye in Hathaway’s Orphanage, Morgue and Funeral Home was on him. Madam, the director of Hathaway’s, only allowed Mortimer to interact with the children if she wanted them brought to her office (or if she thought they were having too much fun).

Finley turned to look up at Mortimer. His steely blank eyes dug into Finley’s, as if Finley were his arch nemesis.

“You, Madam’s office. Now,” Mortimer growled in his usual form of broken communication.

“Can’t I just finish my toast?” Finley asked. He was hoping he wouldn’t have to start his day off like this. Again. These days were always better dealt with on a full stomach. But Finley knew it was already too late. Once Mortimer summoned you there was no hope of enjoying the rest of your day.

Mortimer responded with a huff from his flared nostrils, blowing Finley’s hair back.

“Fine” Finley groaned. He shoveled the remainder of his buttered toast in his mouth and stood up. “But nothing’s even happened yet.”

At least Finley thought nothing had."
26[M4F] looking for my obsession,LetsChat,1i7u1aa,2025-01-22 22:15:53,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsChat/comments/1i7u1aa/26m4f_looking_for_my_obsession/,IcyEye1947,,"Love I’m looking for something special. First ill lay out what I’m wanting so you can tell wether your intrusive or not. Like the title says I want to make you my toy. I want you to be a good girl and obey me in some nsfw. My biggest kink will be controlling you and seeing you submit and obey. Second to that will be the utter enjoyment you get from your kinks so be upfront about what you enjoy so I can make you my depraved little toy itching to cum for me. 

What I want is monogamous and is supposed to be a relationship so there is expectation of us forming a relationship and not just using each other. Im quality time based so if we dont spend time talking then the connection will not be full. 

We can trade pics to see if where attracted to each other at the start, I have long hair (love it or hate it). Some people like super aggressive conversations at the start I tend to be really tame and ramp up as I learn what pleases you. 

I know what I want, Im honest, and good at communication. If your looking for a kinker relationship message me. 

(Btw the names Ill call you really depend on you I think its just as hot when your my little princess bending over for me verses you being my depraved little fuck toy.) "
I regret buying this,SparkingZero,1i7rdgl,2025-01-22 20:03:14,0,0.44,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i7rdgl/i_regret_buying_this/,kittychumaster,Discussion,"bought the ultimate addition cause it looked super promising. had plenty of fun playing through Goku's story, a lot less playing through the other characters less developed ones, and no fun playing online for obvious reasons. was hoping the dlc would add cool story missions to play through at least. I see it's 3 custom episodes and they're all lame as shit. just artificial difficulty galore. oh cell max takes very very little damage but that's it. goku gives you 5 seconds to transform and if you don't hit the window you have to sit through a cutscenes. the android one was fine I guess but still such low quality for a major dlc update. like we can't at least script a beam clash or something in, man? the combat is fine but it's asking too much for what is still a very cheesy system. if I wanted to sweat I'd play fighterz(which I did enjoy a lot) and ig if I wanted story mode stuff to do I should just go buy XenoVerse dlc (a game from 2016 mind you that is still being updated with higher quality dlc drops). I wanna clarify I haven't played XenoVerse in like 5 years but I genuinely got more out of their dlc when I would play it. sad state of this series, I'm prolly not opening it for a long while. I don't blame the devs, I blame bandai for cutting corners but doesn't change the fact this game wasted so much potential. everything beyond Goku's storyline is a tech demo for a game showcase"
What do you Think of Tendi? (The Evil Version of Tari created by TheReelz),SMG4,1i7r8u7,2025-01-22 19:57:24,72,0.94,87,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7r8u7,Money-Lie7814,Discussion/Question,"That is the Question 

Who is Tendi? She is an evil sorta version of Tari created by **TheReelz** in her channel with more character development added by **Chrisomatic** in his channel both Channels are basically SMG4 au's each with there own spin on the Characters basically 

Anyway Tendi is basically Tari if she was a Super Villain and more Cartoon ish but she hilarious but she similar enough to Tari that she still has a heart and out to get the Town filled with mostly Tari's and also falls in love with a more Serious Villain over in Chrisomatic both TheReelz and Chrisomatic confirmed that Tendi that appear  on both there channels are in fact the Same character meaning Tendi has the power to travel the GMOD verse?

Anyway she cool in that Tari finally has an evil counterpart that unlike Belle or Evelyn sorta understand her mind 

Anyway I wonder if SMG4 used Tendi with TheReelz permission how she reaction to SMG4 Crew since she already took on 2 versions of Meggy and Tari and almost identical version of SMG4 Mario

Here are some matchups I dislike,DeathBattleMatchups,1i7mp72,2025-01-22 16:36:29,18,0.81,7,https://i.redd.it/fbg9fogr6mee1.jpeg,Ordinary_Person69,Misc,"From left to right:

Mario vs Sonic 3 along with most MvS MUs: the matchup has been done to death already and we do not need another one. Do y’all REALLY want these 2 to be stuck fighting each other over and over again like Goku and Superman are? Cuz I surely don’t! And the rest of the Mario vs Sonic matchups are either mid or ass. Peach vs Amy; **MID!** Daisy vs Blaze; Awful! Wario vs Knuckles or Shadow; also ass! Luigi vs Tails 2; LITERALLY WHY?!?!

Master Chief vs Samus Aran: And now for the most overrated matchup in the history of vs debating. The connections are generic, it’s a shitstomp, the fight dynamic is ass, their arsenals don’t mesh well considering Chief’s arsenal is just so bland compared to Samus’s even after Infinite. And not to mention this would misutilize Samus. Not only would Samus be robbed of her more impressive artillery since her lesser equipment is more than enough to handle Chief’s best weaponry, but in order to make this work, she would not be portrayed accurately like in say, Dread. Overall, it’s just a complete waste of both. Ruby vs Maka is the definitive memorial matchup for Monty Oum. Need I say more?

Joker vs Green Goblin: Just like I said for Chief vs Samus, the fight dynamic is ass! The only way this would work is if Norman acts like a fucking idiot the whole time and gets off his glider. Unlike Sweet Tooth, Norman is too smart to fall for Joker’s luring attempts. Bro could easily win just by spamming pumpkin bombs on his glider. And not to mention Green Goblin has tanked attacks from Spider-Man who has been established to be far physically superior to Batman a long time ago. Again, a waste of both!

Kazuya Mishima vs Albert Wesker: This matchup has started to be looked down on thanks to Tekken 8 which is absolutely based, it is still unfortunately too popular. The connections are fine I for the most part ig but the real mess lies with its scale. A debunk post goes further into this (along with Chief vs Samus) but in a nutshell, their fighting styles & arsenals do not mesh well. Wesker is a grounded fighter with weird powers, Kazuya is a physical powerhouse who scales far beyond the RE Verse.

Venom vs Spawn: My flair does play a key role in this but trust me, that’s not the only reason. The whole thing is just guys with symbiotic suits created by Todd MacFarlane. I’m sorry, but no! Get that shit outta here!

Flowey vs Monika: I mainly included this cuz I believe DDLC does not qualify for Death Battle for one specific reason… **THE! DOKIS! DON’T! FIGHT!** Monika’s a decent hacker yeah, but the whole fight would be Flowey ripping her to shreds over and over again! It’s a fucking waste!

Ridley vs Rayquaza: Absolute godstomp, connections are just monsters in space, both have better, should I go on?

Eren Yeager vs Bayverse Optimus Prime: Even before the allegations dropped, I still found this matchup to be ass. The whole appeal of this matchup feels like “The Optimus Prime Episode Featuring The Cuck Eren Yeager!”

GT Goku vs Super Goku: 1: we already had a same verse Dragon Ball fight, and 2: This is even more pointless than Gogeta vs Vegito! Everyone knows Super scales above GT! It’s a waste of budget! Next!

Kaguya vs Yhwach: Oh boy! Another generic Naruto vs Bleach episode where it’s most likely the Bleach character gets robbed cuz Death Battle just LOVES to rig the episode against the Bleach character! Honestly, I just don’t trust DB with Bleach especially because of how poorly they handled Aizen. They conveniently ignored the Hogyoku because it was “too vague” but look! Let’s suck off the Naruto character! I don’t even wanna imagine the bullshit they’d pull with Yhwach losing to Kaguya smh.

Every YouTuber & Vtuber MU: 9/10 characters that fall into this category do not fight. Keep YouTubers and Vtubers out of Death Battle please!

Every Same Verse MU that isn’t a Battle Royale: The whole point of vs debating is to compare characters who in no canonical circumstance would interact. Why waste the budget when we can probably have the answer in the source material.

Feel free ask questions I guess. Have a nice day!"

Ive been having this issue when printing. It was fine in the beginning but now it’s been having issues for the month or so working on and off. I don’t know what to do. I ordered a new plate bc I know the one I have is dirty and overused, but I’m scared that’s not the only issue. I’ve cleaned the yellow gear, extruder nozzle, and calibrated.

Making and Ender5 useful again,BIGTREETECH,1i7g2a2,2025-01-22 12:07:52,1,0.67,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BIGTREETECH/comments/1i7g2a2/making_and_ender5_useful_again/,nerve2030,,"So I have an old Ender5 that has been working for me for a while but its really lack luster compared to newer printers. So I would like to upgrade it to at least be useful again. I know its never going to be a Voron or even a P1S but if I can get some more function out of it I think that would be better than trashing it. 

Use case 

functional prints such gridfinity type prints

primarily PLA 

some PETG

NO TPU

NO CF or Glass filaments

So here is what it has for upgrades

Microswiss hot end 

Microswiss direct drive extruder

Bondtech CHT 0.8

Features I am looking for 

Mostly I would like it to be feature equivalent to a P1S

Automatic bed leveling, I'm pretty good at manual leveling at this point but not because I like it.

wi fi support is a must I HATE transferring files via micro sd card

If possible a Print cue would be awesome

remote monitoring I don't need ai spaghetti detection if I can just check up with a camera and stop the print remotely.

Things I don't particularity care about.

Raw speed from the steppers, I have found that using the larger nozzle and chonky layer heights is what works best for most of my prints now. Printing that way typically is slower in the XY direction so I make my speed up in Z.

So I'm guessing I'm in for a new control board, stepper drivers, level sensor, camera, and screen. The issue is I'm not well versed in what works well together and when I look at the website its not super obvious what is meant to work with what. If someone would be so kind to make a recommendation on what parts to get to get me close to what I'm looking for that would be awesome. 

Maybe I should also mention that I have been using Prussa slicer but will be switching over to Orca so if its compatible with that slicer all the better.

"I just want to do some passive investing like in the S&P 500 - if this tracks US companies, does this make my tax situation more complex?",PersonalFinanceCanada,1i7g1zy,2025-01-22 12:07:34,0,0.5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1i7g1zy/i_just_want_to_do_some_passive_investing_like_in/,ronto_TO,Investing,"Basically I read The Value of Simple, and I like the concepts - I'm not super well versed on investing, so I like the idea of just a 'set and forget' on a low fee index fund tracking some large companies that show returns over a long period, like an S&P500 type thing.

I'll be setting up a non registered account for this, and I noticed that the S&P500 tracks a bunch of US companies - how does this impact my tax calculations given I'm a Canadian tax resident?

I really want to keep things simple and easy for myself, so I'm wondering how do I invest in good quality low cost index funds with minimal tax complexity - is it better to choose an ETF with only Canadian companies?

Thank you in advance."

Gonna Say It. Worst thing for the game.,MyHeroUltraRumble,1i79htv,2025-01-22 06:58:47,106,0.9,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyHeroUltraRumble/comments/1i79htv/gonna_say_it_worst_thing_for_the_game/,DerpRep,Game Feedback,"This update is by far the worst thing they could have ever done for their game. I will explain as a day 1 player of this. 
Pros: Toga Duffel Coat outfit.- A skin that many people have been wanting since the beta/alpha
Kurogiri. -Love seeing new characters added
Premium- It's Finally Returned

Cons: 
Premium- Costs 500 crystals to buy for 30 tickets and tuning upgrade things. (500 crystals is way way to expensive.) I am not well versed on every country curreny rates on the game but for 500 crystals assuming you bought the $5 usd pack for 2450 crystals it only gets you 4 weeks. That only 120 tickets. +10 for the base login so 160

Daily and Weekly missions- Jesus this was by far the second worst thing they could do. Instead of getting gallery pieces, tuning mats, and most importantly roll tickets you now get *drum roll* season pass experience!!! WHAT A FUCKING JOKE. Anyone who played this game enough knows it isn't even the slightest bit hard to get experience for the battle pass and now they want to give you more exp for doing dailies and weeklies. Weeklies gave more tickets then 2 if not 3 week of this new premium pass bs. 
The Battle Pass- This change is by far the worst part about this update. Sure the bp now gives more tickets but guess what it cost basically 3 times what it used too. If I'm not mistaken the previous pass cost was 4,800 crystals? And now it's a whopping 13,000. Sure you get them back but assuming you don't have enough crystals saved up from last season you have to buy the $25 pack for the 13k crystals. A literal 25 dollar battle pass that doesn't even give you 1000 tickets for completing it. Sure you get a PUR skin for a character but wholly fuck this is abysmal. This change has basically made this game pay to play whole heartedly. It being a ""free"" game can only let you get away with so much. This game is no longer microtansactions. It's literally macro transaction.

Battle Pass and weekly rewards from premium: So doing a bit of math you get roughly 750 tickets from the Bp assuming you buy the pro pass. As this season is lasting 62 days as of this day if you buy premium you will get a grand total of 330 tickets by the time the bp ends. Adding those together and you roughly 1080 tickets for the entire season. That's assuming that since it's 62 days that the 63rd will not count. But lets just assume you'll get the 9 weeks thing so that brings up the total to 1110 tickets for the entire season. Somebody corect me if I'm wrong but wasn't the old weekly rewards like 80 tickets a week? Plelus the 5 from dailies? How are we just gonna let them take 50 tickets from us per week if not more under the guise of their shady premium login bonus.If they had kept the weekly rewards system you would be getting roughly 720 tickets in total by the end of the season instead of the measly 30 a week from premium. And the best part is... you didn't have to pay crystals for it!!!! I'm no super genius but 720 for the season is way way more then 330. I say 330 cause I'm still not sure if the premium pass will count the last 20 tickets because of the 62 datly timer. Old weekly rewards started at the start of the week so that's why it's 720 instaed of 640.

Ranked- Dude ffs gets rid of this stupid entry cost! I don't know a single person that likes the entry cost mechanic! While I do have characters like Nejire and Rapid Toga for this season to somewhat reduce the cost of entry it's not enough specifically at higher levels.

Ranked Reward tickets: Boy did they fuck this up too. You get 170 tickets for getting to Ace rank this season. Both expert and Ace rank have a reward of 40 tickets. Same as Pro Rank 1, Amateur 1 gets 50. Bruh. Expert and Ace both rewarded you with 100 last season! While getting to both is relatively challenging in their own right those two ranks last season gave more then climbing the entire ranked ladder this season!

Hero Book thing- Still no new pages despite adding new characters still. Sorry for anyone at lvl 30 on that already but no tickets or anything for you.

Special Pass- Literally fucking useless unless your a new player. Why do they even have this thing still up! Special pass was cool initially because you could unlock tech toga and All Might along with sime tickets sprinkled in. I FINISHED THIS IN SEASON 1! No updates to the special pass at all. Genuinely seems like a waste of coding at this point."

Sparking Zero rant,SparkingZero,1i77qw5,2025-01-22 04:57:48,4,0.75,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i77qw5/sparking_zero_rant/,Responsible_Cow_1654,Discussion,"Im just gonna list a few things that irks me about this game and how it could improve.(Post DLC 1 release)

1) The lack of maps.

The current maps are getting boring, we need variety. The fact that they have maps in the game in story mode and we can't use them in online/offline mode is nuts. Why didn't they release the Red ribbon army map with the DLC 1?! Like seriously...Wth I would hope we get to see the likes of Beerus planet, Kami lookout, universe 6 tournament, and Tuffle planet to name a few.

2) Missing Characters that should have been base game.

Characters like Super 17, Buu saga Shin, Fasha, King Vegeta etc. Even the exclusion of an entire arc of super characters like botamo, mageta, jaco from the universe 6 arc and some more characters from the Tournament of Power, like the two namekians Saonel and Pilina, also Basil and Lavender. Hopefully we see them added in a few new packs after The next two Daima packs. In the form of GT pack and super pack etc. Also don't forget the lack of OG Dragon Ball characters...

3) The story mode ""Episode Battle"".

The episode battles felt half finished, just slide shows for most of it. It did have some really good moments, especially the What ifs. The choice to not include the universe 6 tournament is bizzare to me and the missing battles for most of the characters. For example Vegeta Vs God Toppo.... It's one of Vegeta's best fights in Super... And they exclude it. They didn't even add Super hero episodes for Gohan and piccolo. Also piccolo only has fights upto the cell saga and thats all.

Final thoughts: I think this game has so much potential and yet I feel they aren't doing it justice. The game feels half baked. Don't get me wrong its gameplay and graphics are heavenly! But on the content side of things it's lacking. If they want to keep this game alive as long as XenoVerse 2 then they need to listen a bit more to us. Add a couple of small packs in between the big ones. Have community challenges to unlock stuff. Even add parallel quests like XenoVerse 2. That gave the game so much life with the fun dialogues during those quest and the random match ups.

Maybe if they add the rest of the Tenkaichi 3 roster periodically as free content that'll be good. I hope they add more episode battles, stages, costumes etc in the future. 

I wonder if I'm asking too much and being a bit excessive? As it stands it's a good base game, but feels like a cake without frosting at the moment.

Here's to the hopefully bright and long future of Sparking zero!

*Author's Note: Did a rewrite*  
\_\_\_

**Story So Far:**

* *Ingrid handles the stuffy entitled ""gimme your good stuff"" aristocrat trope with Burgers n' Freedom. A giant spider-bot raises the Stars n' Stripes while mice squeak the anthem loudly, making Philia and Cecil hold on to dear life trying not to laugh as Ingrid goes full Hank Hill.*

\_\_\_

“*Signal’s loud and clear, how copy, team?*” Gwen asked over the radio.

“Solid copy, Outlaw.” Cecil replied. “All team members accounted for.”

“*Still, this isn’t the moorlands that Khorak described…*” Zefir remarked “*I mean this looks like a forest clearing…*”

""Oh, so that's what you meant by 'That portal didn't look normal.'"" Ingrid said as she motioned for everyone to step away from the now-shrunken Rogue Rift. It had reduced in size until it looked like a thunderbolt suspended in the air, or looking like an actual tear in the fabric of reality.

Looking around, Ingrid surveyed her surroundings. The clearing they were in was pretty wide enough to host the Superbowl in and allow for parking, with the occasional scattering of small groves of trees and brush here and there. Still, there was definitely plenty of room to allow large monsters admittance, as well as openings in the forest that yawned wide for a good distance before leading into denser foliage. A light mist hung in the air, which only got thick around after hundreds of feet away, giving them a clear view of most of their immediate surroundings.

 

""Wouldn't be the first time this happened to me."" Siria replied quickly ""There's at least two overlapping Rogue Rifts. I'm sure of it. This would be the fifth time I've had to ...""

""Wooooooooooo! Yeah Babeeeeeeeey!"" Ingrid howled, raising her arms in triumph. ""We're in the Leaderboards now!""

In response, Cecil played the meme airhorn sound.

""Leaderboards?"" Peanut asked.

""It means we're among the best."" Philia explained, reaching out to cuddle the little mushroom to her chest.

""Ooooh..."" Peanut said, making cute sounds as Philia snuggled her.

Seeing Ingrid's enthusiasm, the mice squeaked excitedly, jumping up and down in delight and waving their guns. The rest of the Whales smiled in amusement at Ingrid's unexpected reaction.

Cecil stuck out a tendril, which took the shape of a hand making a thumbs-up gesture, “If you did this, Siria, then consider us lucky, am I right?” he winked at the elf.

""W-what?"" Siria said, for some reason she had looked apprehensive when the team had found themselves in a different place, yet the earthlings instead of being angry or confused looked overjoyed.

""What?"" Philia asked, wondering why Siria looked troubled.

""W-well..."" the elf began, trying to compose herself. ""It's just that whenever this happened, I usually get blamed-""

""Skill Issue."" Cecil interjected, causing Ingrid, Philia, and Zefir to break out laughing.

""Excuse me?"" Siria asked, tensing a bit.

""It means..."" Cecil snickered, his beady eyes twinkling with malicious contempt at those who blamed Siria. ""...those wannabe S-Ranks or whatever passes for 'Elite' here start cowering and complaining at the first sign of real difficulty. Forget them, Siria, I'm proud of you for carrying a whole team of losers and coming out on top.""

The elf blushed, her ears drooping as Cecil flew over and patted her head with the jiggly tendril. Eli, Brody, and Ralph also reached out and patted her hair with their soft, squishy paws.

“Thanks Ceci-whaaaa!!!” Siria cried in surprise as Ingrid ran up to her and glomped her, spinning around a few times in glee as she was lifted in the air.

“Siria did nothing wrong!” Ingrid said as she stopped spinning, her voice was muffled as her face was pressed to the elf’s chest.

“Th-thanks Ingrid…! P-put me down! That tickles!” the elf said in embarrassment.

Ingrid complied, happily patting her head. “Best elf.”

Sammy patted the elf’s shoulder reassuringly ""That won't happen with us, Siria. I'm a little too skilled and experienced to be scared of a real adventure.""

The Enthana sisters snickered, half in derision of those wannabe experts that Siria was saddled with, and half because Ingrid had now crouched down and the mice were lining up for cheek rubs, squeaking in delight as Ingrid lavished them in affection. After which they would waddle over to Viel and Selphie who did the same, giggling as the mice paid back their affections with mousy nuzzles.

""That just means we will have a monopoly of the riches here!"" Kvaris smiled before reaching down to pat the mice as they passed by her.

""I agree with sis."" Kinu added, busily scratching behind the mice’s ears, ""Having limp-wits like those touching my treasure would degrade their value anyway.""

""That you successfully closed those portals while having to suffer those fools says a lot about your ability."" Viel said with a gentle smile, her eyes showing genuine admiration.

""You're too good for riff-raff like that. I'm glad you're no longer in their company!"" Peanut crooned as Philia continued to coddle her.

""Thanks, girls."" the elf said, feeling “the warm fuzzies”, as Ingrid called it.

""Your fortitude was wasted on them."" Iohann beamed lightly, then her face took on a more serious expression ""Levity aside, do suffer such...poor excuse of folk, no longer.""

The elf nodded. ""All my fortitude goes to the Whales from now on.""

The felmoon cleric let out an amused bleat.

""Ermm..."" Cuddly murmured, patting Siria's leg. She opened her arms and the adorable hare leapt into her embrace, rubbing noses with her.

""The only hanger-on is probably m-"" Selphie began but Ingrid cut her off.

""Selphie, if nothing else, you're Philia's pet project when it comes to biological weapons research."" Ingrid interjected, rubbing her shoulders ""Your potential is far more horrifyingly destructive if Philia was feeling a little less humane.""

""*Please forgive them*."" Iohann prayed quietly.

Philia shrugged, ""I'm a little too busy to continue developing my FOXDIE Anthrax, Ingrid, no dice.""

“*That explains why you’re coddling a mushroom.*” Zefir coughed.

""Awww..."" Ingrid slumped her shoulders in mock-disappointment. The mice waddled around her and gave her nuzzles, making her giggle at the ticklish sensation.

""You two are the real monsters here!"" Neith gasped in dismay.

""What's that?"" The dryad inquired, looking up at Philia with big curious eyes.

""A virulent plague that spreads quickly, and kills only those we want killed."" Philia said casually, as if explaining the sun rising and setting.

Gwen groaned in disgust.

“That sounds a little too cone hat.” Siria remarked, then quietly giggled as Cuddly comfortingly nibbled on her ear.

“*That’s just horrifying, King Fish.*” Zefir said. “*It’s begging to be hijacked or mutated out of control!*”

""Easy there, Doctor Mengele."" Cecil chortled, his voice distorting a little as the three mice patty-caked his jiggly slime body, squeaking cutely as they did.

""I'm a loving scientist, Cecil."" Philia said, patting Peanut. The little mushroom made cute purring sounds. “I’m just making Peanut and Selphie the best they can be.”

""*That would still be a kindness, considering what Miss Philia's done to those that annoyed her.*"" Gwen spoke up, ""*One time there was a minister she travelled with on a diplomatic mission. Due to him annoying her, in the next city we visited, he was found stumbling about in the streets the next morning, completely flayed and painted in gold. Miss Philia did that personally.*""

""How does that even happen?"" Ingrid asked mildly, still giving the mice cheek rubs.

“Drugs\*.\*” Philia added. “After I took out the wrapping, I sprayed industrial grade funny dust up his nose and sent him on his merry way. Took him to realize what was going on and by that time the public was absolutely traumatized. The city of Ealdyr now has a phobia of naked people covered in gold.”

""What did he do?"" Cecil asked, ""Grab your butt?""

""I would have spared him if he did."" Philia replied quickly, smoothing back her hair.

Gwen continued ""*He was putting forward some concessions with a foreign country that would, if put in effect, would take Miss Philia out of her Weapons Development. At the time she was developing what I would later learn was the deadly VX nerve gas.*""

At the mention of dangerous weapons, the mice squeaked excitedly.

""Neith, how much was that in gold?"" Ingrid asked, with genuine curiosity.

""Ingrid I..."" Neith stammered. ""You're making me glitch here- I... Let's just say, considering the total average surface area of human skin at 22 square feet and the amount to paint it with a thin layer of gold, I would say at the upper end of 44 ounces, totalling at eighty-thousand in today's US Dollars.""

""You spent eighty-thousand dollars to kill someone."" Zefir gaped.

""That's pretty cheap!"" Cecil laughed ""That was on purpose, was it?""

""Well no,"" Phiila said. ""Actually I just did that to pass off his death as the work of some war hawk's thugs, so people would think some country was trying to start a war with Elion-Nosco.""

""That doesn't make sense."" Ingrid said ""That'll make you even busier.""

""No, because then it'll be the 'real' big wigs working and, I, a mere bastard daughter will have more Me Time."" Philia explained. ""So no, I didn't think it was that cheap.""

""*How is that cheap?*"" Zefir cried in shock.

""Eighty thousand to get rid of someone important IS cheap."" Cecil asserted.

""Try the upper billions of dollars."" Ingrid said, shrugging ""That's the usual going rate on Earth, hell, that's probably mid-level even...""

The rest of the Whales looked at the earthlings with dumbfounded shock. Partly because for most of the time, Ingrid and Philia were always conducting themselves as People; they were articulate, intelligent, and eloquent. And so, Gwen's recounting of Philia's cold-blooded, gruesome act and Ingrid and Cecil's utter lack of empathy and sole focus on the “wasted gold”, to say nothing of their knowledge of the going price for taking lives was disturbingly surreal.

""To be fair..."" Philia said calmingly ""Just remember this was an era where I had no expectations of ever seeing Ingrid and Cecil again... hell, other Earth people. It was a dog-eat-dog world especially in Elion-Nosco.""

""No,"" Neith groaned ""You three are just... at the turn of a switch can suddenly go from loving and caring with friends to completely amoral psychopaths that would make Einsatzgruppen look like a boy band.""

""Einsatz... who?"" Kvaris asked.

""*You don't want to know.*"" Zefir said solemnly. ""*Trust me,*""

""I do have morals!"" Ingrid said.

""Preach."" Cecil interjected, eyeing her solenrala.

""I will protect my team, my friends, and family."" Ingrid said firmly, glancing around at the others. ""Nothing feels like a price following those morals.""

""Only feels like a price if you're having second thoughts."" Philia added.

Siria meanwhile had been quiet as Cuddly continued nuzzling her affectionately.

\_\_\_

Making the best of the situation, they now headed towards the direction indicated by Viel's compass spell.

As they approached the edge of the forest, the shifting shapes ahead told them that they were no longer alone in this glade.

""You'd think by this time they'd have come over for a look."" Cecil remarked ""we haven't been totally quiet when we got here.""

""Maybe they're driven by scent or sight."" Ingrid remarked. Some of the shapes were quite tall, probably the bulls or matriarchs of whatever herd this was.

""Fenrir Guild, The Whales!"" Cecil said over the bullhorn. ""Halt and show me your hands!""

The silhouettes in the mist continued to shamble about. There were sounds of snuffling and snorting, as if the creatures or people behind the fog were miserably sick.

""I don't think they either understand or hear us."" Cecil said.

“Worm-heads.” Siria observed. She already had her binoculars out. At the mention of what they were, Kinu and Kvaris mewled in disgust.

“We should put them out of their misery, poor wretched things.” Iohann remarked.

Ingrid put on her binoculars and saw why the team acted disgusted.

The creatures were humanoid in shape. Short thick fur covered their bodies, their heads were worm-like, reminding Ingrid of a decapitated chicken with its long and apparently headless neck. At the end of these long stumps however, was a lamprey-like mouth lined with huge incisors at the front and molars at the back.

“*What the hell is that!?*” Zefir cried in revulsion, the feed from the binoculars showing up on his screen.

“Our overtime money.” Ingrid said easily.

“*Worm-heads.*” Gwen said “*This must be their world.*”

“In all my years, they’re still upsetting to behold.” Siria uttered with distaste.

The worm-heads too finally noticed the whales, letting out a guttural bellow as they charged, at the end of their outstretched arms were three-fingered hands with long, sloth-like claws. They ran along the ground with digitigrade legs at a speed that suggested they were effective predators.

 

“Mice, line up for maximum fire coverage, I’m gonna go play with the boys a bit, be right back!” Ingrid said playfully, turning into a blur that shot skywards. At the same time, Neith launched all her drones.

A large explosion tore a hole in the thick of the worm-heads' midst as Ingrid catapulted herself right in the middle, sending bodies flying everywhere. She quickly turned to kick a particularly huge monster at full force before Philia could utter the first order.

""Full power! Open fire!"" Philia commanded as Selphie got into position.

With a loud squeak, the mice engaged the worm-heads with controlled bursts. With the exception of Team Umbra, the gunners used bullets to punch through multiple targets at once, filling the air with the deafening roar of gunfire. The 189 and Iroquois fireteams had all lined up side to side, maximizing their field of fire. The ensuing massacre obliterated the advancing worm-head front several columns deep.

 

""Selphie, showtime! Gunners, hold the flanks!"" came Philia's next command, The mice let out a loud squeak of acknowledgement as they quickly swivelled to halt the worm-head’s flanking maneuver.

All gunfire was now directed towards the sides of the worm-heads' advance, cutting down their numbers as they tried to spread out. This halted the worm-head's forward charge as chaos spread amongst the recently-exposed front row. First, the explosive, dynamic entry that Ingrid did by crashing right into the middle of their ranks and annihilating them wholesale from within, then the shock and awe as raw firepower stopped their forward charge dead in its tracks, only to split itself into two intense corridors of fire to cut off their attempt to get around it.

Selphie then unleashed a stream of full-auto fire from her pellet gun, sweeping it side to side as she did.

The charging worm-heads gurgled with glee as they were nearly fifty feet away from the whales when suddenly most of them screamed in agony as long, thorny vines burst out of their bodies and started lashing out indiscriminately in all directions. The new razor-sharp appendages from the now-infected worm-heads severed limbs and decapitated heads, the saw-like thorns left deep lacerations that caused fatal bleed outs while the tough ironwood-like vines underneath the thorns fracture bones if it didn’t cleave through it outright.

Even those that didn’t get shot by Selphie found themselves struck in the back as the long vines lashed out to hit them, utterly clearing the front row of all hostiles as the whipcrawlers began to fan out and push deep into the now-panicking crowd of worm-heads.

 

""Pellet Fire!"" Philia commanded, ""Gunners aim forward, shoot between the whipcrawlers! Snipers stick to bullets, shoot through as many as possible!”

The mice began shooting in semi-auto, there was no need to punch through multiple targets, the blunted charge of the worm-heads, the frantic scramble to get away from the whipping vines forced many to get knocked over in the chaos, the ensuing tramping they would get, if it didn't kill them would definitely take them out of the fight for good. Not that the ball-bearing sized pellets didn't have the penetrating power anyway, as the permanent Enhancement lens on the 189 Fireteam's guns made them hit as hard as assault rifle rounds.

“*They’re going to flank again!*” Gwen warned over the radio, her Titania drone flying up high to get a bird’s eye view of what was going on.

With the incoming fire spreading too thin, the worm-heads once again tried to fan out, being squeezed by the onslaught of Selphie's whipcrawlers and Ingrid fighting in the middle. Philia smiled as she saw a tsunami of bodies erupt from the left side, no doubt from Ingrid as she hit the mob with so much force it generated the shockwave equivalent of a freight train tearing through their ranks. This also disrupted the left-side worm-heads that were now trying to move around and flank the Whales.

“Engaging right, Lakota, take the left! Use bullets and pierce through as many as possible!” Cecil said as he flew his portal to the right-most side of the mice. The two big portal-gunships of the Whales rained suppressing fire at the periphery of the whipcrawlers’ advance, further decimating the numbers of those trying to break off and attack the Whales from the sides.

\_\_\_

“*Suika, Cuddly,*” Neith said, observing through multiple vantage points; the team’s tac-cams, the drones, the caddy-mounted cameras, as well as her own, “*...recommend you hold off the left side, King Fish and Kinoko, corral the worm-heads and push them so they can’t flank further. Santiago split up to assist the left and right guard.*”

""Roger, engaging left!"" Selphie called, quickly running over to shoot at the mobs trying to close in.

“Wilco, Glados!” Philia announced as she leapt high into the air, glowing rings on her legs allowing her enhanced mobility. “Peanut, with me!”

“Let’s vanquish them!” Peanut squeaked as she streaked through the air with her.

“Bombard the middle.” Philia said, unleashing shot after shot of explosive FRAG-12 rounds from her shotgun. “Leave the front for Selphie to infest.”

“Alright, Philia!” Peanut responded, pointing her wand near the back of the throng and launching a few big sparkly shots. While slow compared to Philia’s shots they automatically corrected their paths, ensuring they detonated at the highest concentration of worm-heads. In addition, every time Peanut moved, she left behind a small puff of spores that after a second, coalesced into a high-velocity magic arrow. After learning about “hollow-point” bullets from Philia, the little mushroom had modified her “**Spore Arrow**” ability. Rather than seeking to pierce through a target, it abruptly redirected all force outwards like a small explosion inside the body.

""Ermm!!!"" Cuddly grumbled in determination, swishing his wand around as he followed Selphie. The worm-heads that managed to slip past Selphie's pellets and the whipcrawlers suddenly found themselves sinking to the waist as the ground suddenly became like quicksand, allowing his Fae Harriers to bash them while helpless. They didn't need to deal a fatal blow this time, as all it needed was to simply knock their heads into the sticky quicksand to asphyxiate them.

The blossoms on Selphie's antler-like head branches unfurled, shooting out seeds that flew in an arc. Upon reaching the ground, they quickly took root as Selphie's magic accelerated their growth, turning into lotus-like blossoms a foot across. As worm-heads passed near them in number, the flowers let out a glittering golden cloud of corrosive pollen, the unholy result of Philia playing God with biological weapons research and keeping Selphie well-read with Terragalia's floramancy.

Channeling more mana thanks to his Ether Ring, Cuddly augmented his Fae Harriers. This time they became selectively tangible, allowing them to pass through multiple worm-heads in a single strike. The Fae Marsh Hare used this ability to knock the worm-heads either into the lethal proximity of the lotus flowers, or into the quicksand he had created. Those who were knocked into the quicksand got trampled over, further driving them into suffocation as they were pushed deeper.

The Duck Hunter made excited raspy drake calls as he continued to shoot his phantasmal arrows, Cuddly setting his precepts to shoot his painful arrows in a way that pushed them into either quicksand or corrosive flowers.

\_\_\_

Neith’s recommendations were only heard by Philia and her team that headed off the left-side attacks. At that exact same moment, she spoke to another group

“*Valkyrie team, Prophet, recommend you engage right. Santiago split up to assist the left and right guard.*”

“Engaging right!” Sammy shouted excitedly as she, Kinu, and Kvaris charged the incoming horde.

“***Tempest Lancer!***” the trio chorused, summoning into their hands their magic lances that generated a huge maelstrom of wind in the form of a drill. They split their approach as wide as they can to maximize the area of their attack.

“*Oh…*” Neith said mildly as the trio bulldozed their way through “*Forgot that was a thing.* *All fireteams be advised! Valkyrie has charged into the right side, watch your fire!*”

“*Aren’t you glad I took the time to upgrade everyone’s optics?*” Everyone could see in their minds Philia’s smirk as she engaged the enemy. The mice now could see through their optics if any of their teammates were in the line of fire, allowing them to adjust their aim accordingly.

 

The right side of the worm-heads were decimated as the Valkyrie trio swept through, cutting a swath of destruction with their lances. They halted their charge just as they punched through the right flank. As Sammy lay down her Valiant Totem, the Enthana sisters sprinted towards her. Sammy raised her halberd in a rousing war cry as the worm-heads closed in.

“*Valkyrie squad, good kill! Good kill! Amarok, Anubis, Night-Rider’s laying the Totem, get moving!*” Zefir reported, his Oberon drone also watching from above.

The first pulse of Sammy's Valiant Totem knocked all the attackers back, some no longer getting back up either due to the force dealing a lethal concussion to their brains or being knocked out cold; only to be trampled by the rest of their enraged companions. The second pulse was met with Kinu and Kvaris flying in from opposite sides; Meteor Axes held out as they whirled like a deadly buzzsaw with prodigious reach.

As Kinu on Sammy's right side began stabbing away with her corseca polearm, Kvaris leapt in, swinging her flail around in circles of death. The amount of enemies heading her way allowed her to quickly power up the soulstone of her weapon and unleash a mighty whirlwind that gouged its way through the mob. Meanwhile, Kinu's rapid stabs and the ensuing energy spike punctured several opponents at once, the bound warhammer striking the foremost target's chests for a sure kill, the half-moon prongs ensuring they were shoved back to forcibly stumble those jostling behind them.

“*Valkyrie Squad is holding*.” Zefir reported “*Gunners, watch your fire at the right side ahead.*”

 

Sammy was a maelstrom of steel as she rapidly swung her sword in circles, building up momentum to switch between her halberd or Cataclysm Hammer. She alternated between the two weapons, making sure to accumulate energy by bashing through multiple opponents when convenient in order to unleash her Cataclysm Hammer's spell; a series of exploding pillars of force.

Where the Enthana sister's flails generate a whirlwind that tore sideways, Sammy's hammer summoned a series of glowing pillars of force that shot downwards from a height, crushing enemies outright. Then, upon contact with the ground, released the remainder of the force outwards. It certainly took Sammy a longer time to build up her offensive spell however, due to her Guardian blades complimenting every greatsword and halberd strike.

Not that she or the Enthana sisters were in danger of being overrun. Sammy kept her Valiant Totem constantly up, resummoning it to her hand just as the spell ended, it was a testament to the Nightmane warrior's sharp battle acumen and presence of mind. The totem's rhythmic pulses kept columns of worm-heads well spaced as the pulses of magic upon contact with the worm-heads' bodies caused their bodies to be struck with a spectral force equivalent to a full-powered punch from Sammy.

Likewise, she utilized her Janus Blade masterfully. The telekinetically controlled blade of pure mana completely plugged the gaps of attack and defense that even her Totem and Guardian Blades could not fill, allowing her to keep the enemy at bay without taking a single hit, severing arms and necks as the blade materialized to slash or stab. Considering that the control of the blade could only match the same range of motion had it been held in her hand, it spoke volumes of Sammy's mastery of swordsmanship to be able to visualize such precise movements and angles without having to look.

Kinu and Kvaris weren’t lacking in that department either, but Kinu was behind her sister, providing point defense and filling in where she was not attacking with her long-reaching corseca, and Kvaris' flail-work not only outranged her Janus Blade but her speed and skill in swinging her weapon around and the fact that each strike was so vicious that those behind the ones she struck were battered away, meant her own phantom blade was effectively benched.

“*Valykrie squad,*” Zefir came on the radio again. “*Be advised, don’t mind the artillery, that’s just Iohann sending some help your way.*”

The Valkyrie trio laughed as they began to notice crushed, flaming bodies of worm-heads raining from the sky, it didn’t seem like it was going to start a brush fire yet ever other worm-head it came into contact with was set alight as if they had been doused by oil prior to the battle.

\_\_\_

Simultaneous with her recommendation to engage the flanking groups, Neith spoke to Siria directly on her earpiece.

“*Ranger-two, recommend you plug the gaps in the left and right defense.*”

As the Valkyrie squad charged into the flanking force with their Tempest Lances, Iohann stepped forward.

“The mice and I will handle those who approach.” Iohann told Siria, “Take those at the back.”

Gerard and Mason stood a couple of feet away from Iohann’s left, while Oliver and Usher stood at her right side. As the cleric stepped forward, Gerard and Mason raised their aura-clad paws, generating their glaive-wielding clones to stand in front of them and their shadow mouse counterpart.

“Very well,” Siria replied. A large magic circle had manifested at the head of her staff, with several sigils orbiting around it, allowing her to instantly deploy spells. Raising her staff, she shouted the spell’s name, her voice having a supernatural reverb to it as she bent the forces of magic to her will.

""***Gale Prison!***""

Those that were spared the carnage of Valkyrie Squad’s lancer charge found themselves sucked in a tornado created by Siria. At the same time, the mice Gerald, Oliver, Mason, and Usher squeaked their mousy war cry and opened fire at the sides of the tornado to catch the worm-heads trying to get around it. The gold mice’s M-14 EBRs tore through several opponents with each shot. These rifles shot out full-sized battle rifle rounds and with their permanent Enhancement Lens it was as good as a 50-caliber bullet. The shadow mice on the other hand used the secondary barrel of their combat shotguns to spray the crowd with full-auto pellet shots that struck with the force of medium-caliber rifles. The golden mouse clones, rather than wait for the enemies to come close threw their glaives.

 

Iohann stood a short distance in front of the gold-and-shadow fireteams, presenting herself as a tempting target for the onrush of worm-heads as she stood her ground, waving her thurible in benediction as she recited a psalm.

Her Blessed Thurible wasn’t merely a censer mounted atop a staff and doubled as a two-handed flail. The censer itself was a divine relic, used by Saint Cylene the Pious during a landmark pilgrimage that to this day no clergy had yet to emulate. When Iohann was presented this thurible, she wasn't so ascetic as to not jokingly ask if the Saint had used it to bash the heads of those who got in her way. The Archbishop, rather than scold her over some heretical jest, laughed and said that it did double as a weapon. However, the true purpose of sharing this story with her was to emphasize that the thurible wielded formidable divine powers when employed judiciously with the Saint's intercession.

The psalm she was reciting was that intercession. A sharp clarity filled her senses despite the chaos of battle all around her. The censer struck with an impact disproportionate to her strength, sending worm-heads flying as their bones were shattered and organs ruptured, their bodies set alight with divine flame that spread only among their ilk. In effect, Iohann was essentially launching incendiaries with every swing.

Aside from the mice providing covering fire, Iohann also made use of the enchanted greaves she obtained back in Irons to maintain swinging room.

These magically enhanced greaves generated a simulacrum of Iohann (oddly cosplaying as Ingrid for some reason) that performed one of the many named kicking techniques that Ingrid had (in her own words,) ""programmed"" into it.

 

During the nearly one-week long sabbatical the Whales took in order to properly arm and equip the newcomers, Ingrid had walked Iohann through the various kicking techniques she had imbued into the enchanted greaves, showing them their various possible uses.

She then went off into an interesting tangent about her world's various schools of combat known as ""Martial Arts"", named after one of the gods of war and of the schools of ""Muay Thai"", ""Tae Kwon Do"", and ""Capoeira"" from which she apparently drew inspiration from. This revelation brought a newfound respect towards Ingrid. She had once assumed the Nemesis-Stalker was merely fighting using instinct and experience, when in reality it had been honed through not one but many ancient forms of combat. 

While the doppelgangers did not hit anywhere as strong as Ingrid, a kick performed at Iohann's utmost might was still excessive.

“*Dwi Chagi!*” yelled the doppel-Iohann as it quickly darted forward after a quick pivot to build up momentum and shot a brutal back kick to a worm-head’s chest. Siria, who witnessed it from a sideways angle, saw the doppel-Iohann's leg bury itself into the humanoid's chest. A loud, sickening crunch and wet squishy sounds was heard as the foot bulged through the worm-head's back, blood gushing out of its mouth as it crashed backwards into its companions with such force it knocked many of them down like bowling pins. 

“*Posijeunseukig!*” The next Solenrala-wearing Iohann clone soared in an arc, cleaving through the mob with multiple spinning kicks, kicking with one leg after another before landing with a roundhouse; a maneuver Iohann was sure would break her legs and hips twenty times over if she ever tried that.

“*A what?*” Zefir exclaimed in surprise “*How does Starchaser even know how to pronounce that?*”

“*Why? Is that some other language?*” Kinu said as she and Kvaris switched places, this time the younger Enthana sister used her twin swords to hack and slash away while Kvaris alterated between thrusts from her corseca polearm as well as devastating, body-rending slashes from her meteor axe.

“*It’s Korean.I’m sure of it.”* Zefir said quickly *“They have a whole… uhhh… discipline of fighting with your legs.*”

“Po-si-jun-se-kig” Neith repeated. “Four Seasons kick, I don’t even know if that’s a thing, she probably made it up.”

“*I did!*” Ingrid replied. “*And not just Taekwondo.*”

\_\_\_

""***Hailstone Fusillade!***""

As soon as Siria unleashed the tornado, she pointed her staff in the opposite direction to cut off reinforcements on the left-flank. Taking advantage of the mist which was thicker higher up in the air, the spell caused them to well up and concentrate, raining bowling ball-sized hailstones that exploded after a short delay, sending razor-sharp ice shrapnel in all directions. 

""***Flame Strike!***""

Pointing back at the right, the elf conjured a pillar of flame to explode at the densest concentration of approaching worm-heads, once again splitting up the attackers. Those that managed to get away in time however ended up convulsing in pain as Selphie quickly turned to the right and unloaded a short burst of pellets. In a moment, they began shambling back to their friends as their whipcrawler vines burst out of their bodies and gave Iohann and created more gaps in the worm-head’s assault. 

“*Key of the Heavens, strike all who conspire against my noble company!*” Siria cried as she tossed her staff upwards. It hovered in the air, spinning rapidly as electrical arcs snaked all around it. Bolts of lightning struck where enemies had clumped up and there were no allies nearby. Drawing two wands from her belt, Siria cast chantless spells that shot ice spikes at enemies. While it may not have pierced through targets nor killed at the first strike, it rapidly froze the affected and then began to spread, making them just as lethal as the mice’s bullets as the frozen shard turned many vital organs into ice.\_\_\_

As the worm-heads pressed towards Iohann’s mice. Mason and Usher sprang forward, drawing their Daggers of Misdirection as they slung their shotguns and tightened the straps in a quick, smooth motion.

These daggers' pairing with a Wand of Duality allowed them to instantly swap them with massive ""Pike-Cleavers"", greatswords imbued with weight-negating magic as far as the users were concerned and effectively giving them super-strength as far as wielding the swords go. Combined with the protective field the sword generated, it allowed the shadow mice to single-handedly charge headlong into the fray, hacking and slashing fearlessly. 

Mason and Usher had faced worm-heads in the dungeons of Teth-Odin before, the vile creatures' sheer numbers had always forced the mice's little colonies to be on the run. That fear of marauding worm-heads had long disappeared, back when Ingrid's veteran mice pulled the trigger and let out the fierce gunshots that changed their world forever. Part of them longed to put up their shotguns and watch as the dense cloud of buckshot tore apart one of the many creatures that filled their lives with fear.

Another part of them relished in the joy of swinging around a huge blade and watching it cut through the long-necked creatures as easily as the sponge cake desserts that Ingrid loved to spoil them with. The two mice squeaked excitedly as they effortlessly swung their six-foot blades around, cutting through the enemy like a hot knife through butter.

Barely any of the worm-heads' hits made it through, and those that did only struck the protective shields generated by their swords. Sammy's training on how to handle long swords was paying dividends, and the two were experiencing a rush as their former predators quickly became prey to their blades. 

The ability to switch from the huge swords to the small daggers allowed the two to quickly position their paws for the next optimal strike. While akin to the Valkyrie team’s ring-weapons, the shadow mice's magic daggers came with a Misdirection enchantment for added protection while repositioning themselves. When needed; the mice turned invisible for a brief moment, at the same time creating an illusion of them moving in the opposite direction, leaving the worm-heads to grasp at nothing but air and thus compensating for the loss of the forcefield the Pike-Cleavers generated.

Not that Mason and Usher needed to do that on every swing. Sammy had drilled them with various techniques associated with the ""high guard"", which was perfect for their short height and very long reach. While some of these slashing techniques did require them to quickly switch back to their dagger to avoid hitting the ground, the mice's constantly shuffling around around as they attacked allowed them to take advantage of the dagger's requirement to invoke its spell and thus render the loss of defense as inconsequential. 

In addition, the shadow mice also had access to Janus blades, which they employed whenever a grasping claw or kicking leg came their way and their sword or dagger wasn’t in a position to intercept. They also had glaives they could apport to their paws as a surprise thrusting weapon.

In comparison to the Valkyries, the mice were not as well-versed with melee weapons, and their sword-granted forcefield would take hits and get depleted as a result. But comparing them to the Valkyries was already a tall order and the fight had ended long before their shields had reached critical levels.

Fyrinnae 900 Millibars replacement?,Indiemakeupandmore,1i73rl3,2025-01-22 00:13:08,12,0.88,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1i73rl3/fyrinnae_900_millibars_replacement/,shrimpfriedwife,Perfume - Purchased,"A few years ago I got very fixated on Fyrinnae’s 900 Millibars scent and would wear it everyday. It became a signature scent during that time of my life, but I stopped wearing it once I ran out of product + following a bad break up. My 5ml ended up leaking in one of my main bags, so I still smell it frequently and have finally been feeling like wearing it again but it seems like it’s been discontinued! 

I’m not super well versed in scents, but I loved how intense and almost cologne-like it felt. The gender neutrality of it made me feel both handsome and beautiful, seductive. I liked the way it carried some ocean scents along with some slight sweetness. 

Could anyone recommend a good replacement scent that might compare to 900 millibars? Or maybe suggest another that carries a similarly gender-neutral, atmospheric vibe without any metallic tones?"
¿Alguien recuerda un postre parecido?,mexico,1i71jwc,2025-01-21 22:17:20,3,1.0,5,https://i.redd.it/vj9qihsnqgee1.png,Arhorim,Pregunta a México📢,"Se me vino una necesidad de encontrar de nuevo o saber que paso con una mousse o espuma de chocolate que era muy comun de verse en los supers del centro del país a inicios de los 2000, alguien recuerda el nombre o tendra una foto?

Se parecia a este producto que luego saco Alpura copiando la copita del mismo color "
Concealer follow up 😍😍😍,MakeupAddiction,1i70c3v,2025-01-21 21:21:12,4,0.84,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1i70c3v/concealer_follow_up/,noStatusHeart8,,"Hi! I posted a few weeks ago looking for a sub for the Yensa super serum silk concealer. It didn't gain tons of traction or recommendations but I wanted to share that on a whim I bought the NYX bare with me concealer serum and not only is the shade an even better shade match but it wears like a dream! 

Just putting this out in the makeup-verse in case anyone is googling for recommendations after using Yensa!"
