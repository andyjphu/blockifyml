Base Token of the Day 01/24/2025,u_Plastic_Gear8460,1i91i5r,2025-01-24 12:56:01,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Plastic_Gear8460/comments/1i91i5r/base_token_of_the_day_01242025/,Plastic_Gear8460,,"This will be the official daily thread recapping what is happening on BASE chain discussing but not limited to: general updates on the BASE chain ecosystem, the growth of layer 2s, new dApp launches on chain, and any other news. In addition, I will try to compile a brief list of tokens broken up into sub-sections to help guide conversation on that matter.

Hoping that some users take it upon themselves to add their own DD, TA, or news to the thread encompassing both old and new projects on BASE. As always if you have any input or recommendations for this daily thread feel free to comment or direct message me and I will try to incorporate it as we grow this to benefit the BASE community. Thanks for reading and hopefully we can share some gains together on BASE.

"Instead of throwing Bill Gates, Peter Daszak, and Nathan Wolfe in Guantanamo Bay for creating $24T cost 20M death COVID-19 with DARPA/CIA in Wuhan via EcoHealth Global Virome Project (I've proven they did it beyond a doubt in text below), Trump met with Bill Gates 3 hours and talked about a new vaxx",conspiracy_commons,1i6i69v,2025-01-21 08:07:18,7,0.68,15,https://i.redd.it/tnye2u60jcee1.jpeg,TheForce122,,"Nathan Wolfe (Rothschild-Epstein-Maxwell asset) of DARPA/EcoHealth/Gates Foundation ran the COVID-19 creation operation with Peter Daszak of EcoHealth via the Global Virome Project (Wuhan Lab). Nathan Wolfe dedicated his book ""Viral Storm"" to Israeli spy Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates and is BFF with Israeli spy Ghislaine Maxwell.

Here's the archived website for Ghislaine Maxwell's TerraMar company listing Nathan Wolfe and David de Rothschild as Founding Citizens: https://web.archive.org/web/20120715091022/https://theterramarproject.org/

Here's the Nathan Wolfe biography from the University of Houston website (https://archive.is/NOoIZ) which confirms Wolfe works for DARPA, EcoHealth, and Bill Gates: 

>He has received research support totaling over $20 million in grants and contracts from the **Google.org, The Skoll Foundation, NIH, the National Science Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation**, the National Geographic Society, Merck Research Laboratories and various branches of the **U.S. Department of Defense, including: the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance & Response System (GEIS), HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP), and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (USMHRP).** He has extensive consulting experience and has served on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including, since 2004, the editorial board of **EcoHealth** and since 2008, **DARPA's Defense Science Research Council (DSRC).**

>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: 

>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that

>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.


>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.

**Scientist Richard Ebright**

>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.

- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw

**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**

>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.

- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe


**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**

>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. 

>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.


>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. 



**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**

>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.
WIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.
And exactly those sites appear in a ""silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly"" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.

>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?
5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?
about 1 in 10^20!
SARS2 is clearly synthetic!

**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**

Synthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.

In a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.

SARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.

Bsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. 

**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**

#Congressman Larry McDonald, 1976: 

""The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies (Bill Gates) is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control. Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.""

#Chapter entitled ""The Rockefeller-Gates Nexus"" from the book ""The Real Anthony Fauci"" by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

>A century earlier, America’s first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller, had blazed his own wildly successful exit ramp from public loathing, bad press, and antitrust prosecution by launching a medical philanthropy. John D. Rockefeller’s consigliere, Frederick Taylor Gates, served as John D.’s chief business confidant and philanthropic adviser. Frederick Gates helped Rockefeller structure his foundation, advising the mogul that “judicious disposal of his fortune might also blunt further inquiry into its origins.” 

>Practically from his nativity, Bill Gates began coordinating his own foundations’ giving with the Rockefeller organization. In 2018, Bill Gates made the salient observation that “Everywhere our foundation went, we discovered the Rockefeller Foundation had been there first.”

>At the twentieth century’s dawn, Rockefeller’s sanguinary maneuvering—including bribery, price-fixing, corporate espionage, and creating shell companies to conduct illegal activities—had won his Standard Oil Company control of 90 percent of US oil production and made him the richest man in world history with a net worth of over half a trillion in today’s dollars. Senator Robert Lafayette excoriated Rockefeller as “the greatest criminal of the age.” The oil magnate’s father, William “Devil Bill” Rockefeller, was a marauding con artist who supported his family by posing as a doctor and hawking snake oil, opium elixirs, patent medicines, and other miracle cures. In the early 1900s, as scientists discovered pharmaceutical uses for refinery by-products, John D. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the family’s medical pedigree. At that time, nearly half the physicians and medical colleges in the United States practiced holistic or herbal medicine. Rockefeller and his friend Andrew Carnegie, the Big Steel robber baron, dispatched educator Abraham Flexner on a cross-country tour to catalog the status of America’s medical colleges and hospitals.

>The Rockefeller Foundation’s 1910 Flexner Report recommended centralizing America’s medical schooling, abolishing miasma theory, and reorienting these institutions according to “germ theory”—which held that germs alone caused disease— and the pharmaceutical paradigm that emphasized targeting particular germs with specific drugs rather than fortifying the immune system through healthy living, clean water, and good nutrition. With that narrative in hand, Rockefeller financed the campaign to consolidate mainstream medicine, co-opt the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry, and shutter its competition. Rockefeller’s crusade caused the closure of more than half of American medical schools; fostered public and press scorn for homeopathy, osteopathy, chiropractic, nutritional, holistic, functional, integrative, and natural medicines; and led to the incarceration of many practicing physicians.

""Billionaires Try to Shrink World's Population, Report Says""

>The New York meeting of billionaires Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, David Rockefeller, Eli Broad, George Soros, Ted Turner, Oprah, Michael Bloomberg and others was described by the Chronicle of Philanthropy as an informal gathering.

>**Gates in February outlined a plan to try to cap the world's population at 8.3 billion people.**

Bill Gates, Fauci's boss. DARPA. CIA. More importantly, the Rothschild-Rockefeller Mafia NWO at the top who runs the central banks, intelligence agencies, owns all governments and media, and runs the world. Gates is a creation of David Rockefeller. Gates dad was BFF with Rockefeller.


Here's why I believe Bill Gates was involved with COVID:

He invested $55 million in COVID-19 mRNA vaxx creator BioNTech on September 4, 2019 which is 8 days before Wuhan Lab deleted their lab-made coronavirus sequences and COVID-19 began:

- Bill Gates did Event 201 in October 2019, a tabletop exercise which predicted a coronavirus pandemic.

-
 
- Bill Gates starred in Netflix show ""The Next Pandemic"" in November 2019 with Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, the lab that made COVID. In the show, Gates predicted a coronavirus pandemic originating in a Chinese wet market and promoted mRNA vaccines for the first time ever.

COVID was announced one month later, in December 2019.

Keep in mind, DARPA also funded EcoHealth for the virus and funded Moderna/Pfizer for the mRNA death shot. CIA funded EcoHealth and EcoHealth president Peter Daszak is a confirmed CIA asset. Confirmed by former EcoHealth VP Andrew Huff. And Huff says he got a strange job offering by DARPA in September 2019, when COVID was released. He believes it was to lock in him in a classified status so he couldn't share what he knew about EcoHealth being a CIA front company.

Rockefeller**, the wealthiest man in the world, was bankrolling a mining operation in a small town north of Seattle named Monte Cristo. Without delay, Trump scoped out the best location there, secured it by filing a bogus mineral claim, built a hotel on the parcel even though it didn’t actually belong to him, and began giving the customers, once again, exactly what they wanted: plenty to eat, lots to drink and of course women.

>When Monte Cristo proved slow to deliver on its promise, Rockefeller publicly reiterated his support while secretly arranging an exit. In the summer of 1897, Trump also decided to cash out and return to Seattle—making him, along with Rockefeller, one of the few investors in Monte Cristo to end up winners rather than losers.

My Deep Dive into BMX on Base - Backed by Coinbase Ventures,BASE,1hz8yfw,2025-01-11 18:26:23,6,0.88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BASE/comments/1hz8yfw/my_deep_dive_into_bmx_on_base_backed_by_coinbase/,pagan-daniel,Base learning,"I’ve been diving into $BMX, the token behind Morphex (a decentralized perpetual trading platform on Base), and wanted to provide you folks with an informative post on why I feel is has a great deal of potential.
Note: Credit to the breakdown goes to a gent I follow on Twitter.

+++++++++++++++++++

First, some bullish info re: Coinbase Ventures

I'll take a step back for a moment and start with a recent announcement, but first some context... Back in February '24 Coinbase Ventures made a $350k purchase of $AERO (Aerodrome’s token, Base's liquidity hub).
After the announcement, $AERO saw significant growth, eventually landing a Coinbase listing. Aerodrome's token is currently sitting at a mcap of $1B.

Now, here’s why that's interesting: the only other token Coinbase Ventures has market purchased is $BMX, and this time their buy-in was $500k, larger than their $AERO investment back in February of 2024.
It's only been approx. three weeks since this announcement was made.

Note that a VC like Coinbase Ventures is unlikely to associate themselves with a project without some serious DD, much less market purchase $500K of their tokens.

+++++++++++++++++++

On to $BMX and the platform...

So what makes $BMX stand out? It’s the backbone of a broader ecosystem that includes:

A decentralized perpetual trading platform offering up to 60x leverage.

BasedMedia, an NFT marketplace with unique features not found on platforms like OpenSea or Magic Eden.

The tokenomics behind $BMX are impressive. Jesse Pollak (one of the founders of Base) called them “insane money legos” in response to a deep-dive post by project founder ""meowphasaurus"" on Twitter (a read I highly recommend if you want the full breakdown).

+++++++++++++++++++

Here’s a simplified glossary straight from the docs:

BMX: The primary protocol token.
BLT: Liquidity for traders.
wBLT: Wrapped liquidity.
oBMX: Option-token incentives.

It’s also worth noting that $BMX has no VC backing or token sales—similar to projects like Hyperliquid, but with an open ecosystem.

From an even broader perspective, Base is positioned for more growth this year, and two major gaps remain: perpetual/leverage trading and NFTs. $BMX covers both.

Today, $BMX has a market cap under $30m which feels undervalued given its scope and the confidence Coinbase Ventures has in the project and its team.

For context, $GMX hit a market cap of $800m at its peak, and some are projecting higher valuations for $AERO (of course, take projections with a huge grain of salt). It’s impossible to predict price movement but the potential here seems significant enough to look into it IMO.

That said, like anything in crypto there are plenty of unknowns so always DYOR.

Confessions of a Miata Junkie!,Miata,1hylw7b,2025-01-10 21:31:18,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/1hylw7b/confessions_of_a_miata_junkie/,Janitary,,"Hey fellow Miata enthusiasts!

Guess what? I made an impulsive decision when my wife and I got ourselves a brand-new ND2 Miata in May 2023! It was my first Miata, and I absolutely loved it! I took great care of it, giving it regular hand washes.

With just 3,000 miles on the clock, I had a bit of a mishap. A car hit the side of me, and the driver’s side needed some body and paint work. But hey, the guy who hit me took responsibility and said he’d pay for the damage. I was fine, and the car was still in great shape after repairs.

Fast forward to Spring 2024, and I got caught in a hail storm that left my car covered in dings. The insurance paid for the damage, minus the $1,000 deductible that came out of my pocket.

Now, here’s the thing: the service interval for my Miata is 6,500 miles or six months. I took it in for its second oil change this Wednesday, with just 11,900 miles on it. While I was waiting, I asked a salesman if I could order a 2025 special 35th-anniversary edition. He said that 2025 MX-5s haven’t landed yet, and they’re exactly the same as the 2024 ND3s.  The car sales trade teaches to sell what is in stock today. 

He offered me a great price and special financing on a 2024, but I had my heart set on a 2025. My first Miata was a Snowflake Mica Pearl, and I thought I’d love a Soul Red Mica Pearl this time. But when he checked availability, the red one was gone. The aero grey with beige leather interior wasn’t really my style either. There was a black one with black leather interior that had hail damage, but Texas is super hot for three seasons a year, so I couldn’t go for black.

In the end, I decided to go with a 2024 Snowflake White Mica Pearl with a beige leather interior. It’s not my thirty-fifth anniversary edition cosmetically but it’s still brand new. 

Oh, and here are some quick comparisons between the 2023 ND2 and the 2024 ND3:

- The 2023 ND2 has two standard USB ports for streaming music, while the 2024 ND3 has two USB-C ports, which I hope are better than the old ones.
- The 2024 ND3 has LED lights, a new steering rack design, and a new rear asymmetrical differential.
- The trunk looks different, but I think it’s the same size.
- The Grand Touring model of the 2024 ND3 has Bilstein shocks and 17-inch wheels and tires.

As for the cost, I paid $10,000 for the 2023 ND2 over eighteen months and 11,900 miles. And guess what? My finance rate dropped from 4.9% to 2.9%! That’s a huge savings on the back half of the loan. 

So, that’s my Miata journey so far. I hope you enjoyed reading it! Let me know if you have any questions or if you think I lost my mind. I wanted to know what it would cost to trade for a new ND3.  I could have bought a motorcycle and still have an ND2.  I made a choice that I can live with for twenty years or more. "

currently im focus on this 4 LPs, this is my second day and i made around 70$ but i did locked some impermanent loss because of my tight positions, and i had to re-learn how to position myself again xD anyway, i feel more confident on how to positions mysel so i can maximize my profits but im starting and i want to learn more and more on this stuff.

The Ascendancy of Aerodrome Finance (AERO) Post-Coinbase Integration and Investment  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into the transformative journey of Aerodrome Finance (AERO) following its pivotal integration with Coinbase and subsequent investment by Coinbase Ventures. We explore how these developments have catapulted AERO into the spotlight, significantly impacting its market performance, trading volume, and community engagement. The paper examines the price surge post-listing, the strategic implications of Coinbase Ventures' market acquisition of AERO tokens, and the token's role as the central liquidity hub on the Base blockchain. Through a blend of market data analysis, community sentiment review, and technical analysis, we assess the sustainability of AERO's growth, potential market cap trajectories, and the broader implications for the DeFi ecosystem. This abstract encapsulates the discussion on how recent events have not only redefined AERO's market position but also set a precedent for layer-2 token investments, offering insights into future opportunities and challenges within the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

# The 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment Has Begun!

For the [**eighth year in a row**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/), I am happy to announce the launch of the Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment for 2025.  

For those unfamiliar with the Experiments, my annual tradition is to buy $100 of each of the Top Ten Cryptos every New Year’s Day since [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

***The Top Ten Experiments have now purchased a total of $8,000 in crypto since January 2018.***

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio includes the following cryptos, in descending order as per [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) on January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/zex7wo5cclbe1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=4818de85bafc0aff776f36ff8f3df0ee075989de

**That’s a $1000 investment on the 1st of January, 2025**, ($100 each) of #1 **BTC**, #2 **ETH**, #3 **XRP**, #5 **BNB**, #6 **SOL**, #7 **DOGE**, #8 **USDC**, #9 **ADA**, #10 **TRON**, and #11 **AVAX**.

Fun fact #1: *For the second year in a row, all 2025 coins have appeared in at least one past Top Ten Portfolio, meaning no new cryptocurrencies have joined the overall Experiment.* 

Long time Top Ten Experiment followers will notice **I’m again breaking the tradition of strictly investing in the Top Ten by market cap, no matter what.**  To stay consistent with past Experiments, I will only include one stablecoin, so #11 **AVAX** is in and #7 **USDT** is out.  I made a similar decision with the [**2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/), [**2023**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/), and [**2024 Top Ten Portfolios**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/).  

**USDC** will remain in the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio. 

So: ***The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio = Top Ten – USDT + #11 AVAX.***

Q: *Why keep a stablecoin in the portfolio at all?* 

A: Consistency.  For better or worse, I included **USDT** in the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) and one stable in every subsequent year since.  Including a stablecoin in the 2025 Top Ten is my attempt at an honest/fair comparison between each year’s portfolios.

Q: *Why were stablecoins included in the Top Ten Experiments in the first place?*  

A:  Check out the [FAQs](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/).

# Where Did You Purchase The 2025 Top Ten Crypto?

Thanks to the good work they’re doing over at [Universal](https://app.universalassets.xyz/), I barely had to leave Base this year. Details/proof of purchases below:

I used [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/) on Base for **WBTC (ahem, cbBTC)** and **WETH:**

[DefiLlama](https://swap.defillama.com/) on Base for the Universal assets **uSOL, uDOGE, uADA,** and **uXRP.**

Over to BNB Smart Chain’s [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) for **BNB** and **TRON**

And finally, I used [DefiLlama](https://swap.defillama.com/) to purchase **AVAX** on Avalanche :

Fun fact #2: *For the first time in Experiment history, I purchased 100% of the Top Ten on Decentralized Exchanges*

# My Homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Fund VS Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an *attempt to capture the gains of the entire cryptocurrency market.*  

No crypto indexes existed, so I created my own.

Crypto has rapidly progressed in recent years and now more and more options exist.

This year I’ll be comparing my homemade Top Ten Index to [Coinbase’s COIN50](https://www.coinbase.com/coin50), Coinbase’s benchmark crypto index, which offers “diversified exposure to 50 leading digital assets.”  Here’s the snapshot of what COIN50 was worth on 1 January 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/lpxn0y2wclbe1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=264120ef3c9e74a0ae217fc463236474e9e6e690

**Here’s the question I’ll be tracking:** as the year goes by, ***will COIN50 outperform my homemade Top Ten Index Fund?*** 

# All Systems Go!

Like every year, I’m excited to launch the latest iteration of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. If you’re new to the Experiments, welcome! If you’ve been following over the years, many thanks for sticking around. 

The first monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio will drop in early February.  Other reports from the 2018-2024 Top Ten Portfolios will be released periodically over the course of the year.

In the meantime, you’re welcome to pour through years of data [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

Happy New Year and here’s hoping for an up only 2025 (insert rocket emoji here).

If you’ve been around Aerodrome and/or Alienbase for a short time you’ve seen this…”a327”…

a327 is the Patron Saint of Alienbase. Over 6M value currently. Has sent us many a time at all price levels when we needed a morale boost the most. a327 are the last 4 of his wallet and remains a mystery to the Aeros and Aliens far and wide. There was much speculation that they were Coinbase Ventures, which obviously was exciting! But alas, unproven…We don’t know who our Saint is but he is the Top Holder.

It has come to my attention that a327 is also a Top Holder in another project. A DAYS old project. This a guy with conviction. This is a guy you follow. So I am. He doesn’t hold many different coins as I thought he would. He holds 3 I believe. One is days old and is the Base version of the first meme rolled out on Solana that reached insane heights and is still a pantyripper…$Stonks.

$Stonks on Base is YOUR chance to be not just early but EXTREMELY early. Aero and Alienbase members are just starting to onboard heavy with a few of us already Top Holders.

Clever marketing coming imminently!

Grab a small bag. I don’t really do memes but this can be very special. Do NOT sell your $Aero or $ALB for it. But take this opportunity by the balls.

$Stonks on base…swap for it on Alienbase.

Also, what are the pros and cons of Base over other Blockchains?",BASE,1hsmsvx,2025-01-03 08:46:18,8,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BASE/comments/1hsmsvx/is_there_a_base_discord_also_what_are_the_pros/,4TY-63,,"Obviously, Coinbase has a massive user base. Aside from that what is the draw?

I only found it after seeing a mention of Aerodrome somewhere and then buying Aero. I made some good profits on that and then saw Alienbase DEX which feels a lot like Aero but (imo) a much better UI and tokenomics and also early stage. It’s been the cheapest way for me to swap Base memes. I do think Base memes have a great future and we are all super early on so many great opportunities.

But, what is the future of Base and why would developers choose it to build their projects on? Both utility and meme?

Are tokens easier, more affordable to launch here?

During bull run everyone always blame Murphy but it is actually big investors are trying to steal from your pocket. In every cycle they convience you project will fall and make you sell and then they  are buying deep. After that they make you believe that project will skyrocket and make you buy. The they dumb the project and you blame Murphy. Hence, invest a project that you believe when project is not hyped and not promoted. Then dumb the project when you see the project everywhere. For instance aerodrome and alienbase are two sides of this story. I think aero is done. Now it has really high mcap and inflation. So it is not likely to make 10x or higher. But in everywhere it is super hyped and everyone is mentioning 10-20x. They will 90% lose their money. It can make 3-4x max. On the other hand, alienbase is super low profile right now and community is complaining. Some investors are dumping. It has a great chance to make 10x from this point. "

تقديم

عربية الأعمال، قوائم ثنائية اللغة بالمصطلحات
القطاعية الخاصة بالمعاملات الاقتصادية والتجارية
يستجيب هذا العمل لمطلب
ين أساسيين:
المطلب الأول بيداغوجي خاص يتمثل في حاجة الطلبة الماسة إلى أداة مساعدة في الترجمة والاستعمال
اللغوي
،
في مجالات الاقتصاد والأعمال عموما
، من شأنها أن تساعد المتعلم على إثراء ر
صيده الغوي
ثنائي اللغة
.تبين لنا ذلك خلال تدريس مادة الترجمة واشتغالنا في بعض التخصصات ذات الصلة بميادين
هذه اللوائح.
أما المطلب الثاني فهو عام ويتمثل في حاجة المسؤولين عن المقاولات وأطرها و الفاعلين الاقتصاديين
عموما إلى هذا النوع من اللوائح ، يمكنهم أن ي
جدوا فيه جل المصطلحات ذات الصلة بمجال عملهم.
لاحظنا خلال اشتغالنا بالترجمة وتدريس المقاولاتية أن إيجاد المصطلح العربي الملائم يضني أحيانا
صاحبه ويصبح العثور
عليه أمرا يجشم الطالب أو الأستاذ عناء محبطا ويجعله ينفق الوقت الثمين
للحصول عليه.
وقد أنجزت في
هذا المضمار أعمال كثيرة منشورة ولا
جدال في أن بعضها حالفه التوفيق ويتسم
بالرصانة والجدية . غير أن المجال مازال يطالب بالمزيد وأن فيه فراغات هامة تستجدي الملء .
لتحديد وجرد هذه المصطلحات، اعتمدنا على عدة مناهل، منها:

الصحافة اليومية، لا سيما الصفحة الاقتصادية

النشرات الإخبارية الإذ
اعية والتلفزية التي تخصص برامج ل
عالم الاقتصاد

الحصيلة السنوية التي تنشرها المقاولات الكبرى، سواء على أعمدة الجرائد أو في دفاتر مستقلة

البلاغات الصحفية التي تتكلف بإصدارها مديريات التواصل ببع
ض الشركات الكبرى.
3
قمنا بجرد المصطلحات الشائعة في هذه المصادر والبحث في مقابلاتها والتأكد منها عبر مراجعة
القواميس الاقتصادية المتخصصة. ولعل أهميتها تكمن في رصدها المفردات الشائعة والمستعملة في
النصوص الاقتصادية والمالية والمحاسباتية؛ وبالتالي فهي مبنية على
مقاربة واقعية للغة تعتبر الشيوع
والاستعمال بمثابة الفيصل في تبني المصطلح أو إهماله.
من شأن هذه القوائم المصطلحية أن تكون أداة عملية بين أيدي الطلاب لإغناء رصيدهم ثنائي اللغة، كما
يمكن أن يستفيد منها المترجمون وبعض رجال الأعمال الذين تفرض عليهم تعاملاتهم ت
وظيف العربية لغة
للتواصل في مناسبات معينة مثل الندوات الصحفية وغيرها.
ثنتين: ا يجدر بنا أن نشير في هذا الصدد إلى مسألتين
الأولى أن الموضوع لن يصل حتما إلى حد الإشباع ، لأنه هو دوما في الحاجة إلى الإضافة والمتابعة و
التحيين ومواكبة المستجد في هذا الزمن ال
ذي يتسم
-
من أهم ما يتسم به
-
بالتطور السريع للمعرفة .
ولعل الإعلاميات وآثارها في تدبير المقاولات والمحاسبة والإشهار وغيرها مثال يوضح ما نذهب إليه .
المسألة الثانية هي أن المصطلح كي يكون حيا يجب أن يكون مستعملا متداولا، وإلا سيظل مدفونا في
بطون المصنفات، مهملا فوق الرفوف مهما كانت فصاحة ومهارة واضعيه. وواضح أن للمعنيين
-
أعني
هنا أطر المقاولات والمحاسبين والتقنيين والمشتغلين بصفة عامة في هذا المجال
-
نص
يبا من المسؤولية .
يبدو المجال الذي يروم هذا العمل اقتحامه شاسعا ، كأنه بحر لا ساحل له ، إذ هو مجال تتقاطع فه وتتداخل
تخصصات متعددة : المقاولة ومحيطها، الاقتصاد والمالية، المحاسبة ، التجارة، التأمين، التواصل، القانون
...كل ذلك بمختلف التخصصات الفرعية. وعلى
هذا الأساس فإن هذه اللوائح لا تدعي بتاتا تغطية شاملة
وتلبية لكل الحاجات، وإنما هي عمل أولي يمكن تطويره وإكماله لاحقا باستقراء نصوص أخرى.

Understanding staking vs. locking AERO - a generational opportunity?,AerodromeFinance,1hix62l,2024-12-20 18:49:48,37,1.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1hix62l/understanding_staking_vs_locking_aero_a/,enfj4life,,"After doing some more research, I finally got a better grasp of how you can use AERO to yield rewards..

It's not easy to understand, especially when there's a plethora of guides and videos from multiple sources.

People say “reAd thE wHitePapEr” but no one wants to do that. We‘re not all nerds here, we don't care about the tech, and we don't have the mental faculties to understand every bit and detail of it (though we're grateful for the tech. it allows us to make money \^\_\^).

I did as much research as possible, so new people can save themselves the time/headache of researching and buy into this opportunity. The more people who understand AERO, the more people will buy in. If it's hard to understand, fewer people will invest.

With AERO, you can get at least a 50% APR. Which is crazy good.

After learning about it, this is probably the best finance opportunity out there if you get in during all time lows (or if you got in during AERO's release). It feels like learning about bitcoin during the 2017 bull run, so while the concept is amazing once you understand it, don't get too excited while the prices are elevated - maybe wait for it to drop 80% in price before aping in.

If you really dig into this sub, you'll find a few individuals admitting to earning $20k a week from yields, some earn $10k a week, others make $1-5k a week, etc. 

However, it's not without its risks.

If you're interested in investing in AERO, here's what you should know.

This is a lot of information, so don't expect to get it all on your first try. I had to read multiple guides, multiple times to really grasp the concepts. I tried keeping things high level, but I also provide a lot of information and examples (so it may be too much info, but better more than less). I recommend reading this guide at least 2-3 times, on different days, so that the knowledge sinks in. And  try writing out the concepts in your own manner and doing the math on a piece of paper to make sure you really understand it. Ask the community questions. Finally, read other guides to learn from different sources/perspectives. I probably could make a second draft of this guide that's more cleaned up, with tables and visuals, but I'm all written out. Maybe another time.

Also, I'll admit, i did all this research in the past 24 hours. if any details are wrong, feel free to correct me and I'll make edits.

**== Is there and why is there demand for AERO? ==**

Before investing in anything, you want to make sure there's demand for the coin, and a good reason behind it. Let's explore what is AERO and why it's in demand.

**==  Ok, so what is AERO? ==**

AERO is the native token of the Base network, and it plays a key role in facilitating token swaps.

**==  What drives demand for AERO? ==**

If there's liquidity and volume on the Base network, then there's demand for AERO tokens to provide that liquidity.

Look at defillama. Base network had around $2b in volume compared to Solana's $6b in volume in the past 24 hours. Clearly, there is demand.

Furthermore, Base network was launched by Coinbase, and its volume has increased over time. Aerodrome finance is the leading token on the Base network, so you can rest easy knowing this likely isn't a shitty rugpull.

**== Why stake or lock your AERO? ==**

For the 50% APR yields...

If you're just a hold and sell guy, then sure you can do that, but you could do that with most other coins. AERO is unique, so take advantage of its farming/yield benefits.

Here's the summary on staking vs locking

**==  Staking in Liquidity Pools ==**

What can you earn if you invest in a liquidity pool?

Currently, AERO/USDC liquidity pool provides around 50% APR (sometimes it's 60%, but let's use the lower end for example)..

For example -  **Let's say you have $20,000 to invest**. AERO is at $1 each.  Staking requires $10,000 AEROs and $10,000 USDC. In these examples, let's assume 50% APR.

**If AERO stays at $1, you earn around $192 per week (or 192 AEROs per week) from staking.** (50% APR on $20k earns you around $10k in a year)

***Your $20k investment yields nearly $200 per week from staking.***

Not bad, right? Instead of buying a car, that's like having half your rent money paid off, especially on an asset that could appreciate.

**If AERO doubles to $2, you earn around $275 per week** from staking (but because of impermanent loss, with your original AERO investment, instead of increasing by 100% or doubling in value to $20k AERO, it only increases by 40% in value to $14k AERO, plus you get an equal amount of $14k USD due to the way liquidity pool staking works. look up liquidity pool mechanics and the liquidity pool equation)

**If AERO 5x's to $5,** **you earn around $435 per week from staking** (and of course, impermanent loss scales, the higher the AERO price goes).

Nonetheless, in all staking scenarios, you need to take impermanent loss into account.

**== What is impermanent loss? ==**

Learn more about impermanent loss by watching this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_m6Mowq3Ptk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m6Mowq3Ptk)

play with this impermanent loss calculator to start [https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/)

but i like this impermanent loss calculator more, you could plug in more details [https://www.artisandefi.io/lp-calculator](https://www.artisandefi.io/lp-calculator)

**== Staking: Impermanent loss example (AERO increases in price) ==**

So what if AERO goes up in price? From $1 to $2? This is where impermanent loss comes in... It's basically  another word for opportunity cost.

This isn't a bad thing. It just means that if you had held AERO instead of staking it, you would have made more profits from the AERO price increase. For example, if AERO doubles in price, if you had held it, then you would have 2x'd your holdings.. but if you were staking, then would only 1.9x it... (plug it into the loss calculator to confirm... from a $20k investment, with $10k in AERO and $10k in USDC, if you had held instead of staking the AERO, your investment would be $20k AERO + $10K USDC = $30k.. but from staking, you would have around $14k AERO and $14k USDC = $28k.. BUT you also earn APR interest on top of that, so it's no big deal)

It's really not a big deal. You still profit from your original investment regardless, and you're getting your APR yields. You actually earn more with the APR yields over time, so it's better to stake vs. hold in this scenario (unless you just want to just sell off your AERO and profit quickly, and don't want to wait for the APR yields, that's the only time you'd make more money from holding vs. staking).

In summary, if AERO price goes up, then how staking works is that the liquidity pool takes away some of your AERO, but gives you more USDC. You have fewer AERO coins (that are worth more in value) but more USDC coins. It does this to maintain a 50/50 balance in value between the two coins and maintain equilibrium in liquidity. Play around with the impermanent loss calculators to see this in section.

Don't worry. In this scenario, even with fewer AERO coins, it will still always be a higher value amount than your original investment of AERO (and you have more USDC coins to boot). The only thing you lose out on is more potential profits if you had simply held AERO instead of staking.

It's called impermanent loss because it's not permanent... it's only realized if you sell. If AERO increases in price (to $2), you have impermanent loss.. But if you continue staking and the price drops back down to the original  price you bought in at ($1), then the impermanent loss goes away.

**== Staking: Impermanent loss example (AERO decreases in price) ==**

What if AERO prices goes down? This is where the risk comes in, and impermanent loss plays a role here.

You lose MORE money than if you had simply held AERO. Your losses are accelerated.

As a result, the liquidity pool gives you more AERO (which is worth less in value), and less USDC.

Again, those losses are only realized if you sell, hence the term impermanent loss. If AERO price goes back up to your original buy-in price, you're fine.

Play with the impermanent loss calculator to see what this looks like if AERO goes down in price.

By the way, if you invest $20k, and AERO instantly drops 50% in price and holds there... your total value before interest becomes $14k, and you still earn $7k interest on that after a yera, so your total value after 1 year of interest is $21k... you'd still profit $1k if you sold everything after a year. That's the power of APR.

In short, staking is best if you assume the price of AERO largely remain the same... (even though you still profit greatly if the price of AERO increases, and you can still profit if AERO drops by 50% in value and you decide to hold for a year).

**== Locking ==**

Locking your tokens can be a great move. 50% APR is generally the lowest baseline.

This is a great guide to start to learn about locking: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1bsu9vh/advanced\_guide\_to\_locking\_aerodrome\_aero\_tokens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1bsu9vh/advanced_guide_to_locking_aerodrome_aero_tokens/)

The locking pros are:

\- 50% APR (our baseline)

\- Additional 9% APR rebasing, which is basically another 9% APR you get for free (its purpose is to combat dilution.. however it's locked when you receive the rebase, if i recall correctly)

\- The 25% bonus for locking over 2500 AEROs (called flight school lock bonus). So If you lock $10k of AERO, it's like getting another $2.5k for ""free.""

Cons:

\- tokens are locked for 4 years. technically, you can lock for a lower timeframe, but it doesn't make sense because the rewards are substantially reduced.  if you want max rewards, you'll want to lock it for 4 years, and set the lock to auto renew every week. Consider your original investment 'locked' away.

If you want to sell your locked AERO, then you can sell your locked tokens (as an NFT)  for a discount or even buy them for a 30% discount on [https://marketplace.openxswap.exchange/Dashboard](https://marketplace.openxswap.exchange/Dashboard)

Also, if you sell your locked tokens, in order to sell, you'll need to list it at around a 30% discount to get any buyer interest, which basically cancels the 25% flight school bonus you receive from locking your new AERO tokens.

Because most locked AEROs are being sold for 30-40% discounts on the exchange, it makes more sense to buy locked AEROs instead of locking new AERO tokens, as you save an additional 5-15%.

**== Locking Example: If price stays at $1 per AERO ==**

Let's say you buy $20,000 of AERO at $1 per AERO.

And let's assume AERO just remains flat at $1, and we're going off the baseline 50% APR.

If we assume we don't get the new locking bonus (flight school rewards), or rebase bonus, then with your $20k investment in AERO, you'd only be making around $200 per week or $10k per year, which is the same amount you'd earn if you had just staked $10k AERO and $10k USDC. So in this hypothetical, locking earns you the same rewards as staking... So why would anyone lock your tokens and lose your liquidity for 4 years, when you could just stake it and earn the same amount?

That's why AERO introduced two incentives to locking...

You get two bonuses with locking -

A) flight school bonus - your 20,000 AEROs increases your original investment by 25% to $25,000. this is your reward for locking new AEROs. it's an incentive.

B) rebase - you get an additional 9% rebase APR. So no longer is it 50% APR, you earn 59% APR.

With these two bonuses in mind.. you boost your principal by 25%, and your APR increases by 9%.

A $20k investment becomes $25k, and you earn 59% APR instead of 50% APR.

**If AERO stays at $1, then you earn** **$283 per week from locking (283 AEROs per week).**

Not bad for a $20k investment, right?

Notice that this earns more compared to staking your $20k investment, which yields $192 per week. This is because locking not only boosts your principal by 25%, but also yields an additional 9% APR.

**As a result, if we assume AERO's price stays the same, locking increases your yield rewards by nearly 50% compared to staking! ($283 per week from locking vs. $192 per week from staking ... from a $20k investment).**

But let's assume the price goes parabolic...

**== Locking Example: If price goes up 5x from $1 to $5 ==**

Now let's assume you buy $20,000 of AERO at $1 per AERO, and decide to lock it..

But AERO goes from $1 to $5

**If AERO goes from $1 to $5,** y**our 20,000 AEROs (now worth $100k) will yield you around $1419 per week (nearly 300 AEROs per week).**

**Compare this to AERO 5x'ing if you stake in a liquidity pool ($10k in AERO and $10k in USDC), staking would only yield $435 per week. That's a difference of $1419 per week from locking** **vs. $435 per week from staking! A nearly 3.5x difference in weekly earnings.**

**If the price of AERO increases, the gap in yield becomes wider in locking vs, staking, and the yields favor locking much more than staking.** This is why staking can lose you out on a lot of profits due to impermanent loss.

Crazy, right?

When you lock, your $20k investment has not only 5x'd in value, but it's also earning you $74k per year.

Your $20k investment has nearly replaced your day job. This is totally doable... imagine buying in AERO when it first came out, or when it dropped to 40 cents.

Of course, this assumes crypto doesn't completely crash, and that AERO drastically increases in price. Unfortunately, due to the inflationary nature of AERO, and the fact that many people do sell off their AERO yields, that keeps the price lower than it would be without the inflation or infinite supply.

**== Locking vs Staking: Pros and Cons ==**

Staking is good if you need liquidity or don't want to hold 4+ years. With the uncertainty around everything, I think liquidity is important, especially if you really need the money or original investment.

Locking is great if you're a baller and don't need the original investment anytime soon, but you just want the 50% APR yields. The earnings compound when locking large investments, especially with the flight school bonus and rebase APR bonus.

When locking, it's best to consider this money 'out of sight' and to look at locking more for the APR yields and not to get your original investment back (though of course, you can sell it on the exchange for a 30% discount).

If AERO goes up in price, you can earn substantially more in yield earnings if you lock (insead of stake). You can make up to 50% more on your weekly earnings if you lock your full hypotential $20k investment vs. staking your $20k into both AERO/USDC. I showed an example earlier in this thread.

But if AERO goes down in price, you can lose substantially more with locking compared to staking. For example, if AERO loses 50% of its value, then your $20k lock investment becomes worth $10k. But if you staked $10k into AERO and $10k into USDC instead, and AERO loses 50% of its value, then you still have $14k of overall value left.

If you think AERO has potential to 5-10x, and you can afford to lose your principal,  then locking is way more worth it.

**== Another locking vs. staking example ==**

For example, let's say you lock in your $10k AERO investment (at $1 per AERO), and AERO 10x's into $100k. Which actually becomes $125k because of your flight school lock bonus. If you lock, with 59% APR (includes rebase APR), **you earn $73k a year from locking**. However, if you stake $10k AERO with 50% APR (along with $10k USDC), and AERO 10x's, **you only earn $32k a year** **from staking** (which is less due to impermanent loss). **That's a $41k/year difference** (over 2x difference)**.**

But if AERO 'only' 5x's, then locking in your $10k AERO investment (with flight school bonus), turns into $62,500, and with 59% APR, **this earns you $37k per year.** In contrast, staking $10k AERO and $10k USDC, with the 5x increase in AERO price, yields $23k per year. **This is still a $14k/year difference** (nearly a 2x difference)**.**

The more that AERO increases in price, the more returns that you would earn in locking compared to staking (again, because staking results in impermanent loss).

*(yes, i'm very aware that these examples are different compared to my earlier examples.. in this example, i'm giving the advantage to staking, because I'm comparing $10k AERO invested with locking vs. $20k invested in staking split between AERO/USDC... that's $10k more invested in staking. and yet you earn nearly 2x more every week with locking compared to staking, if AERO 5x'd in price...*

*... Whereas in my earlier examples, i did a more 'fair' comparison of $20k invested and locked* *in AERO vs $20k invested in staking split between AERO/USDC... and locking STILL absolutely blows staking out of the water in that example by delivering nearly 3.5x the yields of staking if AERO were to 5x in price... so locking wins in both examples if the price of AERO goes up.. just play around with the numbers in both a normal calculator and the impermanent loss calculator)*

The difference between staking vs. locking yields becomes expontentially wider as AERO increases in price. If you think AERO will increase in price, then consider locking.

You should stake if you believe AERO will largely remain the same in price (or if you need the liquidity and can't wait 4+ years), then stake. You'll earn less compared to locking, but maybe you get peace of mind knowing you can unstake your AERO at any time and sell (who knows, anything can happen. black swan, protocol hacked, etc.). Still, rewards from staking are  insane compared to SPY.

You should lock If you buy AERO at absolute bear market bottom lows (and bear markets always come in crypto..), and you have an extra $10-20k to throw around that you really don't mind losing. Locking delivers WAY higher returns vs. staking, see the examples above.

Keep in mind that with inflation, it'll be more difficult for AERO to 10x, especially as AERO holders sell off their rewards.

Regardless, it’s risky buying AERO when it’s high. Because when it drops, not only does your original investment go down, but so do your yields. Always best to buy during the bear.

**== Staking vs. Locking potential returns ==**

To see what your potential returns will be with staking, use the impermanent loss calculator here: [https://www.artisandefi.io/lp-calculator](https://www.artisandefi.io/lp-calculator) (it allows you to change the variables of starting and final token price, so you can see what your rewards would be if AERO 5x's or 10x's in price)

To see what your potential returns will be with locking, use chatgpt. Give it a hypothetical amount that you'd invest (like $10k), ask it to boost it by 25% (for the flight school bonus),  ask it to multiply that amount by however much you think AERO price would increase (so if you think AERO will 3x, then ask it to multiply your principal by 3x), and  then ask what your yield would be on 59% APR (this includes rebase APR). Then compare your potential locking rewards with what your potential staking rewards would be.

**== How do you stake and lock your AERO? ==**

For staking, I recommend googling and watching videos. It's pretty straightforward. (you can participate in liquidity pools here - https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) Look for the AERO/USDC pool.

For locking, look at this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1bsu9vh/advanced\_guide\_to\_locking\_aerodrome\_aero\_tokens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1bsu9vh/advanced_guide_to_locking_aerodrome_aero_tokens/)

**== Voting ==**

Google and reddit search ""aerodrome + voting."" Other people can explain it better, and it's pretty straightforward.

**== But what about inflation? ==**

Yes, this is a problem. I'll admit I have less info on this, but..

From what I've gathered -

Around 9 million new AEROs will be created every week in perpetuity. Even if everyone votes to decrease emissions by 0.01% (according to their whitepaper), that's basically nothing.

However, many of the new AEROs are locked. The more that are locked, the better, as that reduces selling pressure. But I haven't really seen any sources showing what % of new AEROs are locked, so if anyone could provide that, that'd be great.

It's also a feature of the system. Inflation pays the rewards/bribes for staking/locking AERO.

Another way I look at it is like this - let's say you buy AERO at $1. A year later, AERO is $2. Even if there's 8% monthly inflation, you've doubled your USD investment. So it's almost as if the inflation didn't matter. But of course, that isn't entirely true,  because AERO is less likely to go up if there's a lot of inflation (or if tokens aren't locked) - so keep that in mind.

**== Buy AERO now or later? ==**

AERO is best bought during bear markets. It's risky if you buy AERO while it's high, it's very risky to lock or stake, because your losses accelerate if the price of AERO goes significantly down and you decide to sell (and if you decide to hold, the value of your yields/rewards will be worth significantly less).

if you buy while AERO is high, consider staking, because at least you can exit your investment quickly if needed.

Keep in mind the risks.

In my experience, it's almost never a good idea to FOMO. Prices almost always eventually drop drastically, especially in crypto. Remember when AERO was extremely hyped earlier this year? Then it eventually dropped to sub 50 cents.

In my perspective, with the greed index being high, it's probably best not to ape into AERO. At most, maybe DCA.

During bear markets, alts can drop up to 90-95% in value. Look at what happened to Solana. This could also present an opportunity to buy a large stake in AERO and begin locking/staking.

Counterpoint - if the bitcoin reserve becomes a reality, then this inflates the entire crypto market, and this opportunity may pass you by, so DYOR on how Congress passes bills, what % of them pass, the likelihood of the bitcoin reserve bill passing, etc.

Also, the invasion of Taiwan is a real threat to the stability of the entire market. If any signs creep up that an invasion is imminent, consider selling temporarily for safety. When signs of COVID-19 started popping up in late 2019, early 2020, smart investors pulled their funds before everything went to shit. When 200k Russian forces surrounded Ukraine, I sold all my VTI, and bought back in to make around 10-15% profit.

And with the Trump administration at play, everything's uncertain.

These are risks to consider.

obviously, DYOR, NFA, and DCA is usually the way.

Usually the best plan is to find out ways to increase your income (whether through job or business, or other streams), and stack up your powder for the bear market.

**== Dream scenarios ==**

It's a real possibility that the next bear market could deliver us 20-30 cent AERO, at which point, ape into it, lock or stake it.

Let’s say your patient.. If you lock a $10k investment while AERO is 30 cents , and if AERO goes to $3, not only do you 10x your investment to $100k, but **you** **earn $50k a year in rewards**, **or around $4k per month**. Not bad at all, especially considering that people are doing that right now, who’ve aped into AERO at around 10 cents.

With more capital, if you invest $50k and it 5x’s into $250k (achievable.. if you bought AERO at 40 cents, it already touched the 5x threshold at $2 earlier this week), then **you’d earn $125k in rewards annually** if that price holds… and even better, if AERO 10x’d, then **you’d earn $250k a year in rewards**.

As always, the name of the game is to be the first to invest. But if you're late, then wait for the bear.

Those numbers are insane, and this shows how the capital/money game is rigged. In the above scenario, locking a $10k investment could yield hefty rewards at $50k a year... And locking a $50k investment could replace your job (as long as the world or crypto doesn’t go to complete shit) and pay you $125k a year, or even $250k a year.

Your goal should be to stack as much cash as possible so you can ape into AERO during the bear market and set yourself up for financial freedom

**Remember... this is a high-risk investment. If AERO drops 50-75%, not only does your initial investment go down, but your yield goes down substantially as well. I repeating myself when I say, it's best to buy AERO at all time lows or during a bear market. Now is not the right time to buy, in my opinion, but DYOR and NFA.**"

I think AERO’s timing was not the perfect timing and used it all on fake bull run. When we check the previous ath and mcap, it is around 2$ with 500m mcap. Basically, right now price is %16 down to previous all time high. However, mcap is 2.4x previous all time high mcap. So the inflation is huge. Everytime it cannot get any huge investors price will be down. Most crucial think is that for 500m $ mcap and 2$ price aero it is reasonable to have 10x. It requires only 4.5 billion $ liqudity. But for the time being, for 10x from current price it needs 10.8 billion $ for today and this will increase everyday due to inflation. This is not a reasonable target. The money requires is more than the current mcap of uniswap. To conclude, aero is a solid and reliable project for big investors to double or triple their money. But it is not a good investmen for small investors pending 5-10x. I believe it may see the 5$ price if it is lucky and bull run for alts come on jan. İf it delays max price will be 3-3.5$. "

Comparing Total crypto Marketcap excl. top 10 with specific altcoins is a good way to judge how an altcoin is performing against the average of other lower marketcap coins.

Over the past 75 days:

Crypto marketcap excluding top 10 has increased 92%

https://preview.redd.it/aek3bl5qvb7e1.png?width=2676&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef31ea6f03406ecdec61aeca5511e8b3481dd95b

Bitcoin increased 77%.

Quality coins with intrinsic value will now pull huge moves every couple days one after another, though people will still cry because poop hat retard shit coin went up 40% and their current one hasn't gone up enough yet.  This is called greed.

Quality alts are also making large moves upwards, though most are still 50, 80, 150% below their ATH's (HBAR, LINK, UNI, etc.).  Aerodrome is currently up 300% from it's general low and sitting 17% below it's ATH.

There are various reasons for interest in aero and base liquidity pools.  TVL and MC at current levels are 2x previous ATH and only growing.  Aerodrome and the Base narrative is extremely based.

Alt season has not begun yet and AERO is primed both through ta and market sentiment.

AERO who hold/trade/participate in LP's will of course profit greatly, though most investors won't capitalize because of poor investment strategy.  Diversify your portfolio and take profits at predetermined intervals.

We will reach euphoria soon, have patience."

I figured I'd try my luck asking here anyway. A few months ago after $AERO went from $0.90-ish to above a dollar I stumbled across another project offering a similar ve(3,3) model (Aerodrome Finance being forked from Velodrome Finance, which the project at hand is also forked from) on the chain it sits on and have done some LP-ing to get some emissions.

The LP earnings have been and are still fine for the most part given the current state of the chain having a constant inflated state of network activity, but I've recently come to know from one of the community members that the developer behind the project has been basically missing in action for a while now due to health issues. I've asked and got back a few responses from the community but have grown increasingly speculative that something might have halted the progress of the project altogether.

I'm nearing the conclusion that the lead developer of the project might no longer be with us (figuratively), but putting the whole farfetchedness aside I'd like to ask for anyone or everyone's opinions on a few questions I have about ve(3,3) projects in general since the responses in the sub/server have mostly been from the same one or two community members who more or less are in the same info-draught:

1. What should one expect from a project that's basically in the early stages of what Aerodrome (and Velodrome for that matter) was if its progress halts or stops completely in the absence of the developer, and therefore its continued development?
2. Assuming the chain's TVL increases and more funds get deposited into the project's pools, could the ve(3,3) model still function autonomously and fuel the flywheel effect as intended?
3. In terms of sustainability would the tokenomics model inherently allow the project to function normally as an exchange even without updates, assuming there are no security flaws and that the smart contracts are functioning properly?

At least to my understanding, the tokenomics in and of itself imply that vote-escrowed token holders basically provide governance on which pools get the rewards per epoch, this assuming the chain it's drawing liquidity from doesn't fail in the long run.

What happens if the emissions stop entirely? Especially if the developer behind the project theoretically isn't replaced, would the exchange/project work as long as the chain's TVL rises and more users/arb-bots use the exchange as a means to tap into the ve(3,3) model? I'd really like to hear everyone's thoughts or opinions on what might happen to the project and its token(s) in the future (assuming the project isn't forked) and if anyone has any experience dealing in any project that had a similar event described above and if any of such projects are still running to this day.   
  
Sorry if it's a lot to digest but I've tried asking around elsewhere and it's been challenging getting anything informative so I'm hoping I'd be able to get some questions answered and if possible, some perspectives/opinions here.  
  
Thanks in advance."

Why These Altcoins Are Trending Today — December 13,Blockmandev,1hdo360,2024-12-13 17:26:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1hdo360/why_these_altcoins_are_trending_today_december_13/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Altcoins are back in the spotlight as several top performers shake off recent losses and ride a fresh wave of momentum. Leading the charge today are Velodrome Finance ($VELO), Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), and Aerodrome Finance ($AERO) — and the buzz is real. 

$VELO skyrocketed a massive 125% after Binance announced its spot market listing. Trading at just $0.15 before the news broke, it’s now hovering around $0.33. With buying pressure building, analysts suggest $VELO could rally toward $0.44 — unless profit-taking holders flip the script.

$FARTCOIN also fired up the charts with a 25% surge, pushing its market cap to $655 million. The Solana-based meme coin is looking unstoppable, with strong support at $0.20 and a potential run to $1 in sight. But let’s be real, meme coins are forever a wildcard, so buckle up.

Meanwhile, $AERO — Velodrome’s sister token on Coinbase’s Base chain — finds itself in the mix. While its price dipped 2.5% today, rising Money Flow Index readings paint a bullish picture. If the bulls hold steady, $AERO could aim for $3, but any slowdown might sink it closer to $1.79.

Altcoin season heating up? Let’s watch how this unfolds.

1) I have noticed that there are  no CEX available which will accept ETH on the BASE network?  I tried 4 CEX so far. So they force investors to bridge ETH back to Ethereum network, and thus pay the high bridge costs.

Am I missing something?

  
2) Is AERO Finance like the Jupiter Aggregator on SOL?  Is AERO the Best option to swap as far as token selection and fees?

  
3) Which are the equivalent tokens on BASE for: JTO PYTH JUP MEW ?

Velo vs. Aero ,VelodromeFinancee,1hbnsa7,2024-12-11 01:55:12,9,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VelodromeFinancee/comments/1hbnsa7/velo_vs_aero/,InfactZ,,"Here’s a short explanation of the difference between Velodrome and Aerodrome Finance (Chat-GPT):

Velodrome Finance: Velodrome is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub on the Optimism blockchain, focusing on efficient trading and liquidity incentives for the Optimism ecosystem. It uses an innovative ve(3,3) token model, combining governance with liquidity incentives, making it a core DeFi player on Optimism.

Aerodrome Finance: Aerodrome is a fork of Velodrome but operates on the Base blockchain (a layer-2 network built by Coinbase). While it retains Velodrome’s ve(3,3) mechanics, Aerodrome is tailored to support Base’s ecosystem, aiming to become the central liquidity hub for projects on Base.

Key Difference: Blockchain focus: Velodrome is Optimism-specific, while Aerodrome is designed for Base.

Ecosystem: Aerodrome leverages the same model but targets projects and liquidity needs unique to the Base blockchain.

Velodrome and Aerodrome Finance are developed by the same team, with Aerodrome being a fork of Velodrome. If you believe in Aerodrome’s potential, it’s worth considering Velodrome as both projects share strong fundamentals and similar growth opportunities in their respective ecosystems.

But Aerodrome has the advantage of tapping into Coinbase’s Base network, which attract obviously strong growth in the future.

Velodrome Finance (VELO) could be a good investment for high-reward seekers due to its low market cap (~$120 m at the time of writing the text) and its critical role as the leading DEX on the rapidly growing Optimism Layer-2 ecosystem, offering strong upside potential this bullish market.

I post this for newcomers to make sure everyone knows the connection and main differences to Aerodrome Finance. "

I want to switch from econ to engineering after I graduate, but my degree will state ""Bachelor's in Econ & Finance"", despite double-majoring. My gpa/courses from the double major will appear on my transcripts instead. 

i looked at a few openings on Boeing/Airbus to get ideas on engineers' academic requirements, and it all said one of the following

**-** **Bachelor's of science in aero engineering/physics/chem (or an equivalent technical degree and/or relevant experience)**

**- Bachelor's in Mech/Elec engin** 

Does this mean that my double-major is pretty much useless when trying to break into engineering?

Intro to $AERO,AerodromeFinance,1h8wojs,2024-12-07 11:54:25,35,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerodromeFinance/comments/1h8wojs/intro_to_aero/,Kind_Row_6014,,"***Why Aerodrome Finance (AERO) Will Be the Next Big Crypto Coin to Take Off in the 2025 Bull Run***

As the cryptocurrency space evolves, investors are always on the lookout for the next big coin that could lead the market to new heights. In 2025, many experts and analysts are eyeing **Aerodrome Finance (AERO)** as a project with immense potential to explode during the upcoming bull run. This paper will outline why AERO stands out in the competitive landscape, offering innovative features, a strong foundation, and a promising future in the crypto space.

# 1. What is Aerodrome Finance (AERO)?

Aerodrome Finance (AERO) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to revolutionize how assets are managed and traded in the crypto ecosystem. The core idea behind Aerodrome Finance is to provide more efficient, secure, and user-friendly ways for participants to engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and governance within the ecosystem.

Key Features of Aerodrome Finance:

* **Decentralized Governance**: The AERO token serves as the governance token, giving holders voting power on key protocol decisions.
* **Yield Optimization**: Aerodrome offers optimized yield farming strategies, ensuring maximum returns for liquidity providers.
* **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Aerodrome is designed to work across multiple blockchains, enhancing its accessibility and flexibility.
* **Security**: Leveraging cutting-edge cryptographic methods, Aerodrome aims to create a robust security infrastructure to safeguard assets.

# 2. Reasons Why AERO Will Shine in the 2025 Bull Run

# A. Innovative Yield Optimization Technology

Aerodrome Finance is at the forefront of developing advanced yield optimization strategies that significantly enhance returns for liquidity providers. As more users flock to DeFi for passive income opportunities, projects that offer reliable and high-yield solutions will see increased demand. Aerodrome’s technology is designed to minimize risks while maximizing rewards, attracting both new investors and seasoned DeFi participants.

* **Automated Yield Optimization**: The platform uses automated strategies to ensure that liquidity is always placed in the most profitable pools.
* **Low Fees**: AERO focuses on reducing transaction costs, enabling users to keep more of their profits.

# B. Cross-Chain Interoperability

One of the most exciting aspects of Aerodrome Finance is its cross-chain compatibility. While many DeFi projects are siloed within one blockchain ecosystem (such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain), Aerodrome aims to bridge multiple chains, allowing users to interact with a broader range of assets.

* **Expanding Market Reach**: Cross-chain compatibility allows Aerodrome to tap into various blockchain communities, increasing its user base.
* **Greater Liquidity**: The ability to move assets across different chains helps ensure that liquidity is distributed more efficiently, leading to smoother and more scalable DeFi operations.

# C. Governance Token and Community Involvement

Aerodrome’s native token, AERO, serves as the governance token, empowering holders to participate in crucial decision-making processes. In 2025, we are likely to see a massive rise in decentralized governance as more projects shift power to their communities. Aerodrome's active community will be key to driving the platform's growth and adaptability in the competitive DeFi space.

* **Incentivizing Participation**: Token holders are rewarded for their involvement in governance, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility within the community.
* **Alignment with Decentralized Finance Trends**: As the DeFi movement grows, platforms that promote decentralization and community governance will become more attractive to investors.

# D. Strong Foundation and Team

The success of any crypto project heavily relies on the team behind it. Aerodrome Finance boasts a strong development team with expertise in blockchain technology, finance, and security. The team has already delivered several successful projects and has a track record of delivering on promises. This provides a level of trust that investors are increasingly valuing as they look for projects with reliable teams.

* **Experienced Founders**: The team behind Aerodrome is known for building and maintaining successful blockchain products.
* **Transparency and Trust**: Aerodrome maintains high standards of transparency, which is essential for gaining the trust of investors in the competitive crypto market.

# E. Rising Institutional Interest in DeFi

2025 will likely witness a surge in institutional adoption of DeFi protocols. As traditional financial institutions look to leverage decentralized finance solutions, platforms like Aerodrome that offer scalable, secure, and user-friendly solutions will be well-positioned to capture institutional capital.

* **Enterprise Solutions**: Aerodrome’s cross-chain functionality and yield optimization tools provide opportunities for institutional investors to participate in DeFi without the complexities typically associated with the space.
* **Strong Regulatory Framework**: As the DeFi sector matures, Aerodrome’s commitment to compliance and best practices will make it an attractive option for institutional players looking for a safe entry point into the market.

# 3. Market Trends and Potential Catalysts for AERO

Several key market trends and catalysts are expected to drive the growth of AERO during the 2025 bull run:

* **Increasing DeFi Adoption**: As more users and institutions enter the DeFi space, demand for platforms like Aerodrome, which offer robust features and high yields, will rise.

I turned 18 back in August and started investing primarily in stocks with the small amount of money I had. However, about a month ago, I started getting into crypto, and everything has been exploding since, so I damn near sold my whole stock portfolio for this upcoming bull cycle (which was quite an insignificant amount). Currently, I hold Ondo Finance, Arbitrum, Render, SUI, Aerodrome Finance, ICP, Sand, Avalanche, and Chainlink. I also have a bit of SPX6000, GIGA, and Sigma. I’m considering adding Chainswap and Beam to my portfolio as well. How does my portfolio look so far for this bull run?"

# Bitcoin Breaks $100K

Bitcoin just smashed through $100,000, officially entering “told-you-so” territory for crypto diehards.

Once dismissed as internet monopoly money, it’s now the toast of Wall Street, thanks to a cocktail of ETF launches, regulatory tailwinds, and some help from Washington. The milestone isn’t just a number; it’s a flashing neon sign of crypto’s evolution from edgy outsider to financial heavyweight.  
  
What started as a niche rebellion against the establishment is now a darling of institutional investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are drawing billions, and legacy firms are finally admitting they slept on the crypto boom. 

Even brokerage stalwarts are gearing up to offer Bitcoin trading—because, hey, better late than never. Bitcoin’s climb has also reshaped its narrative from a speculative asset to a legitimate store of value, with corporations and funds buying in like never before.

**A Rally With a Side of Volatility**  
  
Sure, Bitcoin’s wild ride isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s been here before: euphoric highs followed by gut-punch corrections. But this time, big players are in the game, stabilizing the narrative with deeper pockets and long-term strategies. 

With institutional interest growing and regulatory clarity improving, Bitcoin's trajectory feels less like a rollercoaster and more like a rocket—albeit one with a few bumpy stages.

**Looking Ahead:** $100K is just a pit stop for Bitcoin believers, who are eyeing six-digit territory as the new normal. With institutions piling in and retail investors eager to jump on the bandwagon, Bitcoin’s move from fringe to foundation is underway. Still, while the momentum is undeniable, skeptics warn that volatility and over-leverage could trigger another cooling period before the next breakout.

# Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?

In a world where anonymity is practically extinct, Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains a ghost. Despite Bitcoin evolving into a trillion-dollar asset that’s reshaping finance, the identity of its inventor is still the ultimate crypto riddle.  
  
It all started in 2008 when Nakamoto shared a nine-page white paper proposing Bitcoin, a new form of “electronic cash.” Back then, the idea barely made a ripple among cryptographers, many of whom had seen similar concepts fail. But in 2009, Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network, making the first transaction with Hal Finney, a fellow cryptography enthusiast.

For two years, Nakamoto actively engaged on message boards, tweaking the code and working with developers. Then, in 2011, the digital trail went cold. Nakamoto handed the project reins to software developer Gavin Andresen and vanished, leaving the world to guess.  
  
Here’s the kicker: Nakamoto is believed to control around one million Bitcoins, worth a staggering $55 billion today. That wealth would place Nakamoto among the richest people on the planet. But the coins haven’t moved—ever. This could mean several things: Nakamoto might have lost the private keys, passed away without sharing them, or is simply uninterested in cashing out.  
  
Over the years, the hunt for Nakamoto has been relentless. Names like Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, and David Chaum have been floated, only for them to deny involvement. In 2014, a linguistic study pointed to Szabo, who also denied it. And then there’s Craig Wright, the Australian programmer who loudly claimed to be Nakamoto in 2016 but failed to back it up by moving any early Bitcoins.  
  
In a recent Florida lawsuit, Wright faced off against the family of Dave Kleiman, a deceased collaborator. The case alleged they co-created Bitcoin and demanded Wright share the fortune. But the jury found no proof they developed Bitcoin together, leaving Wright's claims as shaky as ever.  
  
Unless someone moves those early Bitcoins or presents ironclad proof, the world may never know who Nakamoto really is. But maybe that’s the point. The mystery has become part of Bitcoin’s lore, cementing its place as the world’s most intriguing financial revolution.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow brings the much-anticipated US employment report, the ultimate pulse check on the labor market. Covering everything from payroll growth to unemployment rates, it’s a key driver for market sentiment. October’s numbers were an outlier, with job creation plummeting from 254,000 in September to just 12,000, thanks to disruptions like hurricanes and a Boeing strike.

Economists are optimistic for a rebound, forecasting over 200,000 new jobs in November. If the predictions hold, it could signal that the labor market remains resilient despite recent setbacks—good news for both Wall Street and Main Street."
"Advancing Uranium Exploration with High-Grade Discoveries in Saskatchewan: Aero Energy Full DD (AERO.v, AAUGF)",smallstreetbets,1h7mpjr,2024-12-05 18:09:22,12,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1h7mpjr/advancing_uranium_exploration_with_highgrade/,dedusitdl,News,"Aero Energy Ltd. (AERO.v or AAUGF for US investors) has taken significant steps in advancing uranium exploration near Uranium City, Saskatchewan on the outer margins of the prolific Athabasca Basin. Recent developments highlight the company’s growing potential in the uranium sector, supported by high-grade assay results, a completed financing round, and plans for future exploration.

https://preview.redd.it/6a4wl4ij345e1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=21cfea50d034df594aa6da4981e761752c8025e1



AERO's 2024 summer drilling program at its Sun Dog Uranium Project yielded promising results. These efforts targeted eight drill holes, with seven returning elevated radioactivity readings, peaking at 1,582 counts per second (cps).



Additional assay results from the Sun Dog prospecting program, confirmed substantial uranium mineralization across several targets:

* *Spring-Dome Target:* Surface assays peaked at 13.0% U₃O₈, with radioactivity surpassing 65,535 cps, highlighting this area’s exceptional potential.  
* *Wishbone Target:* Graphitic metapelite samples returned assays up to 0.32% U₃O₈, further validating this zone as a promising target.  
* *McNie Target:* Boulder sampling revealed assays up to 0.25% U₃O₈, with significant untested geophysical anomalies along major fault systems.  



Notably, Aero has only explored 1% of its expansive 250,000-acre land package, signaling significant potential for future discoveries. To build on this momentum, the company plans to conduct geophysical surveys and launch a winter drilling program to refine targets and expand exploration efforts.



With high-grade discoveries, a recent successful funding round, and vast underexplored landholdings, Aero Energy is emerging as a key contender in the uranium exploration sector. As the company advances its winter drilling plans and continues its exploration efforts, Aero remains well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for uranium.

Celebrating with you guys :-),AerodromeFinance,1h6rico,2024-12-04 16:19:16,20,0.9,2,https://i.redd.it/xzwx0es0fw4e1.jpeg,JakobWassermann,$,"Hello dear astronauts. 

I actually don't like this subreddit that much xD I hope I'm not being hated, but for me there's often too much ""to the moooon"" here without really much substance behind it, just random price predictions and a lot of blah blah. Clearly, no one can know how the crypto market will develop. 

But I want to celebrate something. I've been holding Aero for a while now and am now 1000 euros in profit. That's already sick. For one person that's a lot of money, for another it's just a drop in the ocean. I think it's really cool! I always think about what you could buy for 1000 euros. a new monitor for my pc? return flight for a trip? or or or

what do I want to achieve with this post? On the one hand, I would like to celebrate with you, I wanted to ask how much you are in the plus? I will definitely keep going and update you :-)

Question: I was told (until this morning) that aero cannot be traded on coinbase and I could only exchange it somehow in my wallet, but since this morning it says ""Buy & sell"" again. how come? Does this mean that Coinbase will trade aero again in my country? That's a good sign too! 

When are you getting out? I find it extremely difficult to determine the timing, does anyone have any serious tips or strategies?"
