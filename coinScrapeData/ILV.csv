I tried to swap some Illuvium(ILV) to USDC held on MetaMask.. i connected to Sushiswap but it failed to go through despite Etherscan saying it went through correctly. The wallet has the same bal for both ILV and USDC as pre-swap.

I raised it as a question in the SushiSwap forum on reddit and got a number of responses directing me to a site.. ‚Äôrestore-web3.network/dapp‚Äô, saying i had to re-sync my wallet for the swap to progress.

Has anyone heard of such a site and is the advice offered correct? I‚Äôm naturally nervous about connecting my wallet to the site, and first impressions are not great as all the on-page links open up the same list of wallet options that the site will accept, as opposed to info that the link suggests will take you to.

Thank so much."

Each quarter, Grayscale's research team analyzes hundreds of cryptocurrencies and updates their list of tokens primed for growth.

In their latest top 20 cryptocurrencies, Grayscale included tokens they believe have ""significant potential in the upcoming quarter."" By the end of Q3, six new cryptocurrencies were added to the list of top-performing assets.

""We analyze factors such as network growth and adoption, potential catalysts, the stability of fundamentals, token valuation, supply inflation, and potential risks,"" Grayscale explained.

The newcomers include:

* **SUI**: The native token of the Sui blockchain. After a network upgrade, Sui‚Äôs transaction speed increased by 80%, surpassing even Solana's capabilities.
* **Bittensor**: This protocol simplifies the integration of AI and digital assets. In the past month, TAO's price surged by nearly 70%. According to experts, the project has become one of the standout players in the AI sector.
* **Optimism**: A Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, featuring the Superchain framework. Optimism‚Äôs development is already being used in Coinbase's L2 Base network.
* **Helium**: A leader in the decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) sector. The project now boasts over a million hotspots and 100,000 subscribers. The platform has generated more than $2 million in network fees.
* **Celo**: This blockchain is transitioning to Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2. Developers are focusing on stablecoins and payment solutions in emerging markets, where the project is growing in popularity. By daily stablecoin transactions, it already surpasses Tron.
* **UMA**: The latest addition to Grayscale‚Äôs top 20. UMA is an oracle network utilized by the major prediction market Polymarket.

Other key players in Grayscale‚Äôs ranking include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI). Following the third quarter, some assets were removed from the list, including Render (RND), Mantle (MNT), ThorChain (RUNE), Pendle (PENDLE), Illuvium (ILV), and Raydium (RAY).

Finally, Grayscale analysts highlighted the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, emphasizing their heightened volatility and urging investors to exercise caution."

"Web3 Gaming in 2024: What‚Äôs Really Going On?
",Crypto_General,1feaaeg,2024-09-11 09:36:02,6,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1feaaeg/web3_gaming_in_2024_whats_really_going_on/,YogurtclosetTall2558,Daily Discussion,"It‚Äôs 2024, and Web3 gaming is in a much different spot compared to just a few years ago. If you‚Äôve been keeping an eye on play-to-earn games, you‚Äôve probably noticed that things are becoming more refined. No longer just about the money you can make, the focus is shifting to better gameplay, sustainable economies, and keeping people genuinely interested.

Let‚Äôs talk about a few games that have made moves this year and why they‚Äôre worth checking out.

New Web3 Games Worth Your Time

First off, Illuvium. This game feels like it‚Äôs made for gamers who want both strategy and exploration. You roam through different environments, capturing creatures (called Illuvials), and battling them. It‚Äôs like a polished RPG but with a twist‚Äîyour in-game achievements can actually earn you ILV tokens. What‚Äôs cool is that the earning potential comes from how well you play, not just from showing up. The graphics? Solid, especially for a blockchain game.

Another one is Star Atlas. It‚Äôs a space exploration game where you get to build ships, mine resources, and even engage in space battles. The game‚Äôs dual-token system (ATLAS and POLIS) adds a bit more complexity, giving players the chance to influence in-game governance. It‚Äôs more than just a game‚Äîit feels like its own economy. There‚Äôs a lot to do, and for those into strategy, this could be a good fit.

Then you‚Äôve got Ember Sword, an MMORPG where players control the in-game economy. What makes it stand out is how player-driven everything is. You can own land, trade, and collect items‚Äîall while battling monsters in a pretty expansive world. There‚Äôs a lot of freedom here, and the rewards go beyond basic P2E models by making it fun even without the earning element.

Akarun: A Slightly Different Take on Web3 Gaming

Now, here‚Äôs something a bit under the radar: Akarun. It‚Äôs not as big as some of the others, but it‚Äôs doing something pretty clever. It‚Äôs a racing game where your in-game speed is directly linked to real-world crypto market performance. You pick a cryptocurrency, and if its value moves up in real-time, your character moves faster in the race. It‚Äôs a fun way to mix gaming with crypto trading without feeling like it‚Äôs a gimmick.

Akarun also uses NFTs in a practical way. Owners of specific in-game characters or tracks earn a share of the prize pool each time those assets are used in a race. This approach makes the game more sustainable while giving players more reasons to stay involved.

How Play-to-Earn Has Shifted

One of the big differences in 2024 compared to the early days is that play-to-earn is no longer just about earning tokens for minimal effort. Games like Illuvium, Star Atlas, and even Akarun are tying rewards to skill and strategy. The games are built to last and are designed to keep players engaged, even beyond the financial incentives. This is a welcome change because, let‚Äôs be honest, the early days of P2E were mostly about farming tokens without much thought.

Now, there‚Äôs a much better balance between fun and earning potential. The tokenomics are smarter, and the gameplay is deeper. Whether you‚Äôre into exploring new worlds, space battles, or racing against crypto prices, there‚Äôs something for everyone in this space.

What‚Äôs Next?

As we head deeper into 2024, the trend seems clear: the future of Web3 gaming is about creating engaging experiences that just happen to have blockchain elements built in. Players want fun first, and earning comes second. This shift will likely attract more gamers, even those who haven‚Äôt yet dabbled in blockchain.

So, what games are you playing this year? Have you tried any of these, or is there something else I should check out?"

If you've been following the world of Web3 gaming, you probably know that 2024 has been a transformative year for the industry. We've come a long way from the early days of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where the hype often outpaced the actual gameplay. Now, we're seeing a new wave of games that are not just about earning tokens but are genuinely fun and engaging. Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs changed and highlight a few key players leading this charge.

  
1. Illuvium

Genre: Open-World RPG

What Makes It Stand Out: Illuvium is being hailed for its AAA-quality graphics and strategic gameplay, offering a rich open-world experience where players capture and battle creatures called Illuvials. The game‚Äôs integration of ILV tokens and a carefully designed economy ensures that earnings are linked to in-game success rather than just speculation.

Why It‚Äôs Special: The combination of deep gameplay mechanics with blockchain rewards makes Illuvium a leader in the Web3 gaming space. The game also features staking options and governance elements, giving players a say in the game‚Äôs future development.

2. Star Atlas

Genre: Space Exploration

What Makes It Stand Out: Star Atlas offers an expansive universe for players to explore, mine resources, and engage in space battles. The dual-token economy (ATLAS and POLIS) adds depth to its economic model, allowing for both in-game transactions and governance participation.

Why It‚Äôs Special: The game‚Äôs scale and ambition, coupled with its detailed graphics and complex economy, make it a unique offering in the blockchain gaming world. It appeals to players interested in both deep strategy and immersive exploration.

3. Ember Sword

Genre: MMORPG

What Makes It Stand Out: Ember Sword is praised for its player-driven economy and land ownership mechanics. The game allows players to own, trade, and develop land, all while engaging in traditional MMORPG activities like battling monsters and exploring vast worlds.

Why It‚Äôs Special: Its free-to-play model combined with a sustainable economy ensures that players are rewarded for both gameplay and investment in the game‚Äôs ecosystem. The game is also designed to be accessible to both crypto-savvy players and those new to blockchain.

4. Akarun

Genre: Racing / Strategy

What Makes It Stand Out: Akarun integrates real-time cryptocurrency data into its gameplay, where the performance of your in-game character is tied to the real-world market performance of a chosen cryptocurrency. This unique mechanic adds a strategic layer to the racing genre, making it more dynamic and engaging.

Why It‚Äôs Special: Akarun‚Äôs use of NFTs isn‚Äôt just for show; these assets are functional within the game, earning players a share of race rewards. This model ensures that the game‚Äôs economy is both rewarding and sustainable, attracting a dedicated player base.

So, what‚Äôs next for Web3 gaming? If 2024 is any indication, we‚Äôre heading towards an era where the lines between traditional gaming and blockchain gaming blur even further. The focus is increasingly on creating games that are fun to play, with the P2E aspect being a bonus rather than the main draw. Games like Illuvium, Star Atlas, Ember Sword, and Akarun are leading the charge, showing that it‚Äôs possible to build games that offer both great gameplay and real-world value.

As the industry continues to grow, we can expect more innovation in how games are designed, played, and monetized. Whether you‚Äôre here for the gaming, the earning potential, or both, there‚Äôs never been a better time to dive into the world of Web3 games.

What are your thoughts? Have you tried any of these games, or are there other titles on your radar?"

# Illuvium Overworld & Arena Patch Notes - 0.4.2

Rangers, this update is packed with exciting changes across many systems and brings us closer to the mainnet release. While the story is still being kept under wraps for now, it will be introduced later. We hope you enjoy this update!

# Forge UI Overhaul

* **Instant Crafting and Navigation:**Players can now hover over materials in a recipe to instantly craft them or navigate to the material's recipe.
* **Clean and Intuitive Design:**The entire interface has been reworked to be cleaner and more user-friendly, making it easier for players to understand and navigate.
* **Processing Tab:**A new processing tab has been added to display the status of items during forging.

# Onboarding & Menu Changes

In preparation for the launch, you‚Äôll find some updates that tie into the upcoming full tutorial experience.

* **Main Menu:**We started redesigning the main menu layout, clearly separating the Arena and Overworld. New navigation buttons streamline access to various in-game and external locations.
* **New Customisation:**An update to Character Customisation adds more options. Note that this is still a work in progress, and more updates are coming.
* **Drone Selection:**Upon completing the tutorial, players will select their drone and character customisation. Currently, players cannot change their drone once selected.



# Weapon and Suit Rework

We are excited to introduce new Weapons and Suits designed to improve gameplay and cater to various playstyles. This update aims to provide players with more strategic options and a refreshed combat experience. The weapon affinity and class system is now more in line with the Illuvials' affinity and class mechanics.

* **25 T0 Weapon Lines:**Based on the old weapons, each comes with one Primary Affinity and one Primary Class.
* **15 New Weapon Lines:**¬†Ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 5, these new weapons change with each stage:
   * **Stage 1:**Weapons have a primary affinity and class.
   * **Stage 2:**Either the affinity or class becomes composite, similar to how Illuvials change through their stages.
   * **Stage 3:**Weapons feature both a composite class and affinity.
* **Weapon & Suit Reset:**All previously crafted suits and weapons will be removed from inventories and unavailable after the update.
* **Suits Rework:**Suits have been renamed, and their effects and stats have been reworked to better align with different playstyles.
* **Mastery Point Cost Adjustment:**The Mastery Point cost has been adjusted to reflect the power level changes of the new Weapons and Suits.
* **In-Progress Assets:**New Weapons and Suits are still under development. Images are provided to help differentiate between the new weapons, while in-game models will reuse some old weapons as placeholders. The new assets, including their attack and omega animations, are in progress.
* **Bonding Removal:**The bonding mechanic has been removed with the new weapon system.

# Various Changes

* **Flint-Cap Consumable Bug Fix:**Resolved an issue where the Flint-Cap Consumable provided more XP than intended.
* **Mastery Points Adjustment:**Increased the target for Mastery Points required for Encounters.
* **Encounter Mods Nerf:**Reduced the effectiveness of Encounter Mods.
* **Consumable Adjustments:**Various adjustments were made to consumables to balance gameplay.
* **Encounter Cost Increase:**The cost of encounters has increased from 300 to 675.
* **Team Slots Increase:**Default team slots increased to 8 Illuvials, 4 Weapons, and 4 Suits.
* **Drone Attachments Removed:**Slots, Detection Range, and Scan Cost attachments for drones have been removed.
* **Gemstones in Illuvial Fusion:**Gemstones were added to the Illuvial Fusion process. Composites formed from 2 similar affinities will only require one Gemstone.
* **Mega Deposits Extraction Time:**Reduced the extraction time for Mega Deposits.
* **Holo & Dark Holo:**All missing images have been updated with placeholders. These will be updated with their final versions as they become available. The bug for the Illuvials' Fur not showing the Holo and Dark Holo effect has been fixed.
* **XP & Leveling:**Introducing a UI showing XP gained after Overworld encounters or Arena matches, helping players track progress.
* **Survival Update:**Survival mode now supports the recent Ascension mechanic introduced in Ascendant a few months back.
* **Free Card Rotation:**The free card rotation feature allows you to complete your teams with the Illuvials, Weapons, and Suits on free rotation and the Free Teams.
* **Recipe Requirement Changes:**Updated most recipe requirements to better align with the changes in the new economy.
* **Shard Dust Rework:**Reworked the amount of Shard Dust received from deconstructing Shards.
* **Holo Illuvial Chance Decrease:**Decreased the chance of finding Holo and Dark Holo Illuvials.
* **Mega Deposit Loot Improvement:**Improved loot from Mega Deposits while decreasing the number of Mega Deposit spawns.
* **Deposit Gemstone:**Fixed an issue causing deposits to predominantly contain Nature and Water gemstones, regardless of the region played.
* **Travel Cost:**Increased Travel Cost for Stages 2 and 3.
* **Cosmetic Integration:**We started the final Cosmetic Integrations seen in UIs. While emotes are unavailable now, players can select the Battle Board but only have the default one. The Battle Board selection phase is included in Ascendant, but with most players using the default Battle Boards, you‚Äôll always play on the Default Ascendant Board.
* **And many bug fixes‚Ä¶**

# Missions

Substantial updates to the Missions system include a reworked user interface in-game and new mission types.

* **Missions User Interface Rework:**The Missions UI has been reworked for a cleaner and more user-friendly experience.

Attention Rangers!

The moment we've all been eagerly anticipating has finally arrived. We now have a confirmed Launch Date.

On the **25th of July**, the Illuvium Universe opens.

While we could launch sooner, we want to include the following features to make the launch considerably more impactful and secure:



Arena

‚Ä¢ Gauntlet Mode

‚Ä¢ New Weapons System



Overworld

‚Ä¢ Combat

‚Ä¢ NPC Interactions

‚Ä¢ Economy Adjustments

‚Ä¢ Character Customisation

‚Ä¢ Forge UX Revamp



Zero

‚Ä¢ Missions

‚Ä¢ iOS/Play Store

‚Ä¢ PC/Mac Support with Mobile UI



Backend / Security

‚Ä¢ Maintenance - Game Pauses



We are not guaranteeing that all features will be ready before the launch date, but we intend to include as many as possible. After discussing this with the Community Council and the Main Council, we believe that even a few of these features will significantly improve the gaming experience across all three games and will be worth the wait. Additionally, this extra time allows us to optimise the economy and ensure our security and backend systems are ready to handle the load.



As these features become available, we will integrate them into the testnet build, which will be accessible to all participants with access. As always, getting player feedback before we launch will be crucial.



We'd like to invite you to join us for a Town Hall meeting this Thursday at 8 p.m. UTC to discuss any outstanding community questions. Submit your questions here: [https://link.illuvium.io/Townhallquestions](https://link.illuvium.io/Townhallquestions)

Additionally, don't miss the eagerly awaited Release Date Trailer Premiere on YouTube at 6 p.m. UTC this Friday.

Save the Date: Friday, June 7th, at 18:00 UTC

Set a Reminder: [Youtube Premier](https://youtu.be/isY_4jcftrA)



Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of Illuvium like never before. This premiere is an event you won‚Äôt want to miss! Tune in, share the excitement, and celebrate this milestone together.



Get Involved Now

Download the Open Beta Testnet and start preparing for the official launch! This is your chance to get a head start, explore the game, and provide valuable feedback to help us fine-tune the experience.

Additional Rewards

As a thank you for your patience, we are adding 10,000 $ILV rewards to the existing 20,000 $ILV pool for the testnet phase. This brings the total rewards pool to 30,000 $ILV, providing even more incentive to dive into the testnet and help us fine-tune the game.



We thank you for sticking with us on this journey and can‚Äôt wait to launch with you.



Best,

TL; DR‚ÄîIlluvium is launching its $20m airdrop campaign for players playing its games next month. It should be cool to see if they can attract some Web2 gamers over to play.

Hey frens,

I wanted to discuss an initiative from Illuvium that could serve as a benchmark for future crypto-gaming projects. Starting April 30th, as part of their upcoming Private Beta 4, Illuvium is rolling out a $20 million Play-2-Airdrop campaign to distribute 200,000 ILV tokens to participants.

For those unfamiliar, Illuvium is a blockchain-based game that merges high-quality gameplay with crypto mechanics.

The goal? To attract seasoned crypto enthusiasts and gamers from the Web2 space by offering tangible rewards beyond traditional gaming incentives. Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre planning:

* **Engagement Through Innovation**: By integrating a Play-2-Airdrop model, they‚Äôre potentially changing how players interact with in-game economies and asset ownership.
* **Bridging Web2 and Web3**: With substantial airdrops, they aim to make the leap less daunting for traditional gamers curious about blockchain gaming.

**Discussion Points**:

* How do Play-2-Airdrop mechanisms impact player engagement and the broader game economy?
* Can such large-scale airdrops stabilise token value and foster a sustainable player base?
* Will the promise of earnings attract Web2 gamers, and if so, will the gameplay be compelling enough to retain them?

I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and insights on these questions. Could this be a turning point for blockchain gaming?"

**I'm Registered; now what?**  
Private Beta 4 Testnet is set to begin on April 30th, and you're ready to go now that you‚Äôre registered and have your IMX Passport account. There are a few ways to help yourself get access to our limited space Private Beta 4. If you have played Private Beta 3 or any of our games consistently, you are the type of gamers we are looking for to test the features in this latest build ahead of Open Beta Testnet. We will also run campaigns with several partners and creators to raffle beta codes to their communities. Although access for everyone isn't guaranteed, we intend to get many participants into PB4 playing and testing. If you don't get in, don't worry. The Open Beta Testnet is live one month after the start of Private Beta 4 and will be open to the public.

**Play-2-Airdrop Campaign: $25 Million in ILV tokens**  
Over the next six months, we've set aside 200,000 ILV tokens for distribution. Private Beta 4 will be your first opportunity to start stacking Airdrop points for this campaign. All the details for our upcoming airdrop campaign are detailed in our most recent blog post here: https://illuvium.io/news/illuvium-airdrop-season"

 Rangers, we are thrilled to reveal the details of our upcoming campaign, which is set to be monumental! We're launching one of the largest Airdrop campaigns ever witnessed in GameFi, with a massive allocation of 250,000 ILV tokens. This includes 50,000 ILV dedicated to our loyal holders and a gigantic 200,000 ILV set aside for our 6-month Play-to-Airdrop initiative. The total value of this enormous campaign is approximately $25 million at the time of writing this. Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to earn your share of these rewards!

## Illuvium Loyalty Airdrop

First, we have a loyalty airdrop that rewards all of you who have interacted with the Illuvium ecosystem for the past three years. Rewards will be based on several activities across our ecosystem, and an internal points system will determine the size of your ILV airdrop. We want to thank our entire community for helping Illuvium get to where we are today.

**Snapshot Date:** We took a snapshot on April 15th, 2024, 00:00 UTC, to see who's been active and participating within the Illuvium ecosystem.

**Distribution Date:** The loyalty rewards will be distributed to our dedicated participants in Q2 2024. 

### Who Receives a Share of the Rewards?

This campaign isn‚Äôt only about our progress; it‚Äôs a celebration of our loyal community members who have journeyed with us. And for those who couldn‚Äôt participate this time, fret not‚Äîfuture campaigns will ensure newcomers can enjoy great rewards, keeping our community vibrant and inclusive. Participating in the ecosystem is the best way to ensure you are eligible for future rewards. 

* **Illuvium Participants:**  
Whether you're a staker, purchased land, a Beyond collector, or trading on IlluviDex, there's something for you.

### How are the points attributed?

The Loyalty Airdrop is about your participation and interaction within the Illuvium ecosystem. Points were accrued for the following activities:

* **Staking in the ILV pool:**  
Amount and duration of your stake.
* **Staking in the Sushi Liquidity Pool:**  
Amount and duration of your stake. Additional points were accrued for this pool.
* **Illuvitars & Land:**  
The amount spent.
* **IlluviDex Trading Fees:**  
Trading volume within the Illuvidex.

### The Reward Calculation

The final tally of ILV you earn is based on the number of points you've gathered versus the total points collected by everyone. The more you've participated, the bigger your share of the **50,000 ILV** airdrop.

## Illuvium Play-to-Airdrop Campaign

We aren‚Äôt stopping with the Loyalty Airdrop. The real meat of our Airdrop Campaign is the Play-to-Airdrop portion, where the more you play, the more points you earn.

## How do you earn Airdrop points?:

To earn a piece of the 200,000 $ILV, play-to-airdrop, battle in the Illuvium: Arena, explore, hunt, and collect in the Overworld, develop your land in Illuvium: Zero and finally trade and fill your album in Illuvium: Beyond. We will have a points system for activities across all games. In the future, an informative dashboard will give you a clear view of your airdrop points.

### Airdrop #1 - 20,000 ILV

This first 10% allocation of ILV is dedicated to the testnet phase of the beta: PB4 beginning on April 30th & Open Beta Testnet set to start on May 28th. At the end of Open Beta Testnet, airdrop points will be tallied, and everyone who participated in the beta will be airdropped this portion of ILV directly to their IMX Passport wallets. While no end date is specified for the Open Beta Testnet, you can check out our previous blog to see our roadmap of launch details here:[ PB4 All You Need to Know](https://illuvium.io/news/illuvium-beta-4-all-you-need-to-know).

* **Private Beta 4 (PB4):** Pre-register and get access to Private Beta 4. Play as much as possible, hunt for bugs, and ensure everything's operating smoothly on Testnet. You'll earn a flat number of airdrop points to get you started.
* **Open Beta (Testnet):** Didn't get into PB4? That's okay. Once we finish with PB4, we will open the gates to the public, and everyone can earn airdrop points for playing. Remember, the more you play across the four games, the more points you earn.

### Airdrop #2 - 180,000 ILV

* **Open Beta (Mainnet):** This is when we transition to Mainnet for the first time. Players can own their Illuvium assets. This portion of the campaign will last an additional five months, and airdrop points will be calculated at the end of this period. While this is still a beta, more features will be added overtime, players will earn airdrop points across all our games.
* **Illuvium Beyond:** Activity across Beyond will also gather points; whether you're actively trading Illuvitars and accessories or buying D1SKS, you can earn airdrop points.

And there you have it - a quick rundown of what's coming your way with the Illuvium Airdrop Campaign. Whether you're a loyal Illuvium investor, a gamer or both, we've got something special for you. It's our way of saying thanks!"

Now I realize I can't stake it on the Illuvium staking page using BNB, it needs to be on ETH/ERC20. 

What is the easiest/cheapest way to get my ILV from BNB Chain into my ETH Metamask so I can stake them? ETH gas fees suck they're so high!

Rangers, to get to know Florian, we asked him some questions about his work and a couple of fun ones just to get insight into what makes an Illuvium Core Contributor!

&#x200B;

üîπ Favorite Part of the Design Process? ""I like the UX phase, but I prefer UI. Once done, creating Figma components and prototypes is satisfying and sharing prototypes internally is great to have feedback from the team.""

&#x200B;

üîπ Toughest Challenge Recently? ""That's not from this week, but the most recent problem was the Arena filters (to filter your cards during a match). Some players were using them a lot, and some not at all. So I needed to find a solution to keep filters for players who use them but also be able to ""hide"" them if you don't use them (to avoid losing space on the screen). Something simple and easy to use. I won't go into details, but we found the solution!""

&#x200B;

üîπ Indispensable Tools? ""Obviously, Figma.""

&#x200B;

üîπ Favorite In-game Character? ""First, I'm attached to good-looking stuff, so my choice is made based on the character's look, not his skills (sorry); I think it's this little cat called Stoic Terralynx. The NFT render is awesome.""

&#x200B;

üîπ Zombie Apocalypse Strategy?"" I'd create an app, 'Zomb'here,' using Figma. It would let users locate zombies, tag their numbers, and whether they've fed recently. Plus, in-app purchases (maybe in ILV?) for survival guides like 'How to Kill a Zombie' or 'Crafting a Zombie-Killer Stick from a Toothbrush.'"" ü™•

## Rangers, Gear Up for the Leaderboard Rewards!

**We're excited to announce the launch of our Season 1 Leaderboard rewards! Get ready to compete and win big - with 166 ILV tokens up for grabs every week!**

## Timeline:

**The excitement begins with rating resets! Our first weekly snapshot begins on January 31st, 2024, at 00:00 UTC. Mark your calendars!**

## Reward Distribution:

## Rules for Fair Play:

**Remember, fair play is key! Breaking the rules will lead to disqualification and a potential account ban, but rest assured, an appeals process is in place for any concerns.**

* **Additional Accounts: Only one account per player. Secondary accounts must be identifiable. \[Example: Porklamington, Porklamington1, Porklamington2\]**
* **Intentional Losses & Surrenders: No intentional losses or surrenders to manipulate game outcomes.**
* **Consequences: Violators face disqualification and a possible ban, with an available appeals process.**

**Contact our support team if you have any issues:** [**https://link.illuvium.io/support**](https://link.illuvium.io/support)

## Rating Resets

**A soft rating reset shifts your rating towards the average while preserving the overall rankings. Your visual Rank will be modified to mirror your newly adjusted rating.**

## How Will It Work?

**Rating Adjustment: Your rating will shift towards the mean by a set percentage. This shift will be more pronounced for players at the rating extremes than those nearer the average.**

**Default**

**First**

**- Rating Uncertainty Adjustment: 200% (2x)**

**- Rating Uncertainty Adjustment: 250% (2.5x)**

**- Rating Percentage Adjustment: 50%**

**- Rating Percentage Adjustment: 60%**

**Increased Rating Uncertainty: Following the reset, your rating's uncertainty level will rise. This change ensures that your initial matches post-reset have a more considerable impact on your rating, with significant shifts based on performance.**

**Rank Reset: Your rank aligns with your adjusted rating and will be updated accordingly.**

## Why Are We Doing This?

**Maintaining Competitive Integrity: This reset aims to foster a fair competitive environment, minimising the impact of rating deviations caused by evolving gameplay elements, imbalance, and bug exploits.**

**Dynamic Post-Reset Matches: The increased volatility in ratings post-reset not only adds excitement to your early games but also serves a critical purpose: ensuring players swiftly return to a rating that truly reflects their skill.**

**Ranking Climb: While the reset itself won‚Äôt immediately alter your ranking, the top performers will rapidly rise in the rankings post-reset due to the increased gains from each match.**

## Rationale Behind Rating Reset Instead Of Rank Reset

**In contrast to many games where only the visual rank is changed, we adjust the underlying skill metrics. Our primary reason is the dynamic nature of being pre-release. Imbalances and bugs can lead to inflated ratings that do not accurately represent player skill. Resetting ratings periodically ensures that top players consistently demonstrate their prowess. Our ultimate aim is to maintain systems that reflect our players' skills.**

## Planning and Implementation

**Private Beta Phase Adjustments: Anticipate more regular resets during the private beta phase. This strategy will help us refine our ranking system and incorporate player feedback effectively.**

**Long-Term Planning: Post-release, these resets may be scheduled to coincide with longer seasonal cycles, but the exact mechanics will most likely differ significantly. Season 1 will start off at a one-month duration.**

## We Value Your Participation

**Your Feedback is Important: We welcome and encourage you to voice your experiences and insights as these changes take effect.**

**Stay Informed: Rest assured, we will update you on the specifics of these adjustments as they are finalised.**

**Thank you for your support and involvement. Your active participation helps shape an excellent gaming experience for our community.**

**Rating: A numerical representation of a player's skill level in the game, calculated using the Glicko-2 rating system. It is a dynamic metric that changes based on match outcomes.**

**Ranking: The ordered list of players sorted by their rating. This determines a player's position relative to others in the game based on their skill level.**

**Rank: A visual title given to players based on their rating. It symbolises their skill tier (e.g., Bronze I, Silver III, Holo CDXX).**"

The market could go in several directions, but the odds seem favorable for continued gains:

* There is risk of a near-term correction or recession which could cause a 50-70% drop, but the long-term bull case still looks strong
* Even with a drop, we‚Äôre closer to the next crypto bull run than the last peak
* Bitcoin and top coins likely to hit new all-time highs in a future bull run
* Odds favor continuation of current bitcoin rally, triggering a ‚Äúwave‚Äù across altcoins
* Bitcoin goes first, then ETH, then large caps, finally mid and small caps
* Now is the time to position in gaming and metaverse coins before the wave hits

The core investment thesis is that gaming/metaverse crypto assets offer strong upside due to being early in the adoption curve. There are many narratives driving rapid growth and interest in this sector.

# Coins and Assets Discussed

**Large Cap Infrastructure Plays**

* Avalanche (AVAX) ‚Äì platform for metaverse gaming apps
* ImmutableX (IMX) ‚Äì NFT infrastructure partnered with top games
* Beam ‚Äì general gaming infrastructure plugging into multiple ecosystems

**Gaming Blue Chips**

* SuperFarm (SUPER) ‚Äì NFT and gaming infrastructure
* Illuvium (ILV) ‚Äì pioneering AAA blockchain game

**Mid Cap Opportunities**

* Myria (MYRIA) ‚Äì NFT infrastructure for gaming
* Altura (ALU) ‚Äì NFT tools and assets for game developers

**Gaming Studios**

* Wagmi Games (WAGMI) ‚Äì focused on mobile gaming
* Nakamoto Games (NAKA) ‚Äì prolific gaming studio

**Launchpads**

* Seedify Launchpad (SFUND) ‚Äì launchpad focused on gaming projects
* PAID Network (PAID) ‚Äì general crypto launchpad

**Notable Upcoming Launches**

* Bloodloop ‚Äì horror gaming project launching soon
* Treverse ‚Äì anticipated game and token launch

In addition to the above coins, additional gaming sectors highlighted as promising include gambling/betting projects as well as mobile gaming given global smartphone adoption. Rather than just buying the assets listed, the recommendation is to use the framework and logic for what makes strong crypto gaming investments to identify other opportunities.

# How to Position in the Market

The current environment calls for a balanced approach of stepping into projects likely to benefit from a bull run while managing risk appropriately:

* Gain diversified exposure across 8-12 gaming projects rather than overconcentrating
* Scale position sizes based on risk tolerance and project specifics
* Consider staking coins and locking positions to ride out near-term volatility
* Keep moderate exposure of 5% of net worth considering path dependency and volatility

Rather than buying right at launch, the ideal entry point is participation in presales, IDOs or locked allocations via launchpads. This allows positioning before the asset goes live and is subject to unpredictable open market swings.

# Summary

In summary, evidence suggests bitcoin and Ethereum strengthening further, which should trigger a chain reaction taking gaming and metaverse crypto assets markedly higher due to inflow of profits from larger markets. If this thesis holds, the projects discussed in this report stand to generate substantial returns on investment. Manage risk accordingly."

The investment  manager outlined expectations for IMX to secure a top 25 market cap  position, emphasizing well-designed tokens and the launch of AAA games,  such as [Illuvium](https://gam3s.gg/news/illuvium-epic-games-store-listing-governance-update/) and [Guild of Guardians](https://gam3s.gg/news/immutable-GOG-demo-results-web3-gaming/). VanEck analysts, Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush, conveyed optimism about IMX's trajectory, stating;¬†*""IMX  is likely to become a top 25 coin by market cap with the release of  Illuvium, Guild of Guardians, and other high-budget games in 2024. Its  well-designed token aligns interests effectively.""* As one of¬†Immutable's flagship games, [Illuvium offers diverse gameplay styles](https://gam3s.gg/illuvium/),  including an open-world adventure and competitive auto-battler mode,  all powered by Ethereum's scaling network. The game's incorporation of  various NFTs, including a $72 million digital land NFT sale in June  2022, highlights its notable position in the web3 gaming space. 

 IMX, an [ERC-20 utility token powering the Immutable](https://www.immutable.com/ecosystem)  ecosystem, continues to be a key player in the evolving blockchain  gaming space. Leveraging Unreal Engine 5 and Immutable's blockchain, [Illuvium](https://gam3s.gg/illuvium-zero/),  with multiple games in development, aims to compete with established  non-blockchain games. The $ILV token associated with Illuvium, currently  boasting a market cap above $620 million and a substantial following,  positions the project as a potential catalyst for mainstream adoption of  web3 gaming. [VanEck's analysts highlighted](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/digital-assets/matthew-sigel-vanecks-15-crypto-predictions-for-2024/) the significance of Immutable's gaming ecosystem, stating:¬†*""Immutable  has multiple AAA games building on their platform that implement token  models not easily farmed, providing genuinely enjoyable gaming  experiences. These titles, funded with over $100 million and years in  development, are set to release in 2024, potentially attracting players  at the scale of traditional AAA games.""* 

 This partnership comes off the heels of Immutable's recent announcements with¬†[Ubisoft Strategic Innovation Lab](https://gam3s.gg/news/immutable-ubisoft-strategic-innovation-lab/)¬†and¬†[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://gam3s.gg/news/immutable-amazon-web3-gaming/).

When SAND was less than 0,05$ i wrote about it in some websites...  
Mostly the people balmed me like: Nobody cares for Blockchaingames...  
Most of you know, that the people which blamed me, missed big Sand run from 0,05$ to over 8$....

This time I have this two games in my target.  
Illuvium everybody knows whos activly inside the Ethereum Ecosystem.  
Cornucopias is built on Cardano. Thats why less people know it.  
But, the Cornucopias (COPI token) can be traded with ADA and also with ETH on Uniswap!

In my opinion both projects could become high traffic blockchain games:

Attached are both Websites and the ETH token contracts:

[https://illuvium.io/](https://illuvium.io/)  
0x767FE9EDC9E0dF98E07454847909b5E959D7ca0E  
ILV current MarketCap (according to Coingecko): over 650$ Million

[https://cornucopias.io/](https://cornucopias.io/)  
0x42Baf1f659D765C65ADE5BB7E08eb2C680360d9d  
COPI current MarketCap (according to Coingecko): over 80$ Million

Form your own opinion about both games!  
Ofc.  there are many differences between all three games. But as a gamer, for  me TheSandBoxGame was the start for the Blockchaingaming epoch!  Illuvium and Cornucopias are the evolutions of it.

What  are your thoughts about Blockchaingaming? What do you think about this  both projects. Yeah, Illuvium is just in beta and Corncucopias is just  in alpha. Its hard to compare gameplay on a proper way.

But if you realy do some research, both games are looking great (At least on the papers and on the first youtube videos)....

Like  allways: Everything is just my own opinion. This is NOT a financial  advice. Everybody is resposible for their own decisions!"

Supernova Shards $LFC | The Star Atlas of BSC | No One Realizes How Big This Game Will Be,CryptoMoonShots,17ybvn7,2023-11-18 12:52:25,109,0.93,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/17ybvn7/supernova_shards_lfc_the_star_atlas_of_bsc_no_one/,elchaserzk,BSC Token,"**TL;DR**  
A battle-tested team with top-level game development and publishing talent is building an EPIC deep space Web3 game that no one is talking about. The same team previously built 'Space Arena' (5 million downloads with 4.7 rating and 190k reviews). They also built 0xUniverse in 2017-2019, one of the most popular Web3 games of the time.  
These guys have a genuine love for playing space games ‚Äì and nearly a decade of experience building them led to their vision for building the ultimate one.  
Fortunately for us, they decided to build it right here in the Web3 gaming space.  
It‚Äôs sitting at just 1M marketcap at the time of this post.   
**Gameplay**  
This game is different. It‚Äôs part of the next wave of great Web3 games that we‚Äôve been waiting for to arrive. I believe the concept and gameplay is going to create major FOMO as soon as the BSC community (and wider web3 gaming audience) realizes what is happening here.  
I mention the BSC community specifically because they will absolutely embrace and champion a game like this as soon as they understand what they have.  
But all Web3 gamers are going to be fired up about the innovative gameplay this one offers. It‚Äôs a crowning achievement in space game play in general, let alone in Web3 gaming (see their recent Twitter post for a sick preview clip and development update).  
Players will be able to build their own spaceships, walk and fight PvP inside the ship or ship-to-ship. It has modularity similar to Minecraft, but with a strong and exciting open in-game economy.  
**Epic Games Store**    
Supernova Shards is already listed on the Epic Games Store (Access to 32 million monthly active users). Huge for credibility and traction once the game launches. The game is alpha testing so the listing last month wasn't widely marketed and flew under the radar.  
Illuvium - Epic Games leader on Ethereum  
ILV: 525m marketcap (525x larger)  
Star Atlas - Epic Games leader on Solana  
ATLAS/POLIS: 120m marketcap (120x larger)  
Supernova Shards - Epic Games leader on BSC  
LFC: 1m marketcap  
**Moonshot Potential**  
Every cycle there are a few projects that go undiscovered or forgotten. The token launched during a difficult time in the market and the team‚Äôs focus was on developing the game rather than marketing and business development efforts. But with the game launch on the horizon (Q2 2024), that will surely change soon.  
**This is a proven formula for moonshot hunters!**  
1. The quality of the team and game is stronger than anyone has realized yet. 

* Epic Games Store
* Huobi Ventures invested at a valuation WAY higher than the 1.3m marketcap we have now
* The game launched on Seedify (the market timing was unfortunate for them but great for us) 

2. The token has been beaten down by crypto winter and the team‚Äôs decision to focus on game development before community growth (also great for us)  
3. There are upcoming catalysts and a shift in marketing and business development strategy that is going to change everything.   
*Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt have direct knowledge of planned marketing activities but these things always ramp up as the launch gets closer. The team hasn‚Äôt dedicated their lives to building space games just to let their chef d'oeuvre (masterpiece) launch without marketing.*   
**These are the kind of dynamics that lead to very comfy holds if you spot them early enough!**  
**My Takeaways**

* I genuinely believe Supernova Shards could become one of the biggest and most FOMO-inducing Web3 games released in 2024.
* IMO it‚Äôs the **most undervalued** Web3 game on Epic Games Store altogether (another separate narrative that could send this into warp speed).
* The BSC community is going to be all over this. I can genuinely see this game receiving the level of hype and FOMO that **Star Atlas** achieved with the Solana community. 
* Even if it doesn‚Äôt become an epic moonshot, the fundamentals and gameplay put it light years ahead of most Web3 games that have a valuation **5-10x larger**. 
* I‚Äôve seen on-chain data that suggests **something big is brewing**. There are some interesting wallets accumulating on the open market (including a prominent VC using his doxxed wallet). 
* Web3 gaming is heating up! **VC funding is surging** as Web3 gaming leads the way along with DeFi and Infrastructure. 
* This is only the second project I‚Äôve taken a full-size position in this year. Kaspa (KAS) was the other one (although I sold too early).

Crypto-exchange justifying bankruptcy through a T&C's disclosure - what should I do?,legaladvice,173urlv,2023-10-09 11:32:32,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/173urlv/cryptoexchange_justifying_bankruptcy_through_a/,BeautifulMission5289,Computer and Internet,"Hello,  
  
I used to invest in cryptocurrency, primarily on the exchange service named ""crypto.com"". Eventually, I wanted to withdraw the remainder of my money, due to real life situations, but the service refused. Here is the timeline of the late events.  
  
I had: 2.74825 ""Illuvium"" (ILV).  
  
March 14 - 2.74825 ILV -> 176.71 EUR (price at the time: 1 ILV = 64.2991 EUR).  
In order to withdraw money, you must first send money from the bank account you want to withdraw to. As only an old English bank account was connected, I sent 1 Euro from my Polish bank (ING Bank Slaski).  
Could not withdraw: ""Fiat withdrawals for your account have been temporarily disabled, we are working to resume this as soon as possible""  
I contacted the team and spent a lot of time messaging back and forth. No solution was provided, I was only told to wait and that this problem is currently facing more of their customers, not only me.  
  
March 30 - Seeing withdrawal as not possible, I switched the fiat currency back to ILV. Unsure of my reasoning at the time, but still wanted to withdraw. - 177.72 EUR -> 3.13089 ILV  
March 31 - I lost hope in the service and really needed the money. Therefore, I changed my ILV to BTC, in order to send it to a friend, who would send me some money in return. - 3.1308 ILV -> 0.00638345 BTC (164.21 EUR).  
Sent all BTC = 0.00638345 BTC (-0.0006BTC fee) (776.68 PLN), as withdrawal to an external BTC wallet. I was not allowed to send it otherwise. Sent 0.00578345 BTC. My friend sent me 600 PLN (at the time worth 127.92 EUR).  
  
I lost 50 Euros on that transaction and a lot of time that I spent negatively. I was told after all this trouble that this situation followed crypto.com's terms of use. My guess is that they were referring to this (taken from Google, ""CRYPTO.COM APP T&Cs - Last Update: 6 March 2023"":  
  
7.1B(f):  
(f) Fiat Withdrawals are not reversible or refundable, unless we determine, at our discretion to do so.   
In addition, we may, at our discretion, reverse, cancel, void or refuse to process any Fiat Withdrawals.  
  
For an exchange to refuse withdrawals such as this at their discretion is simply put illegal. Seeing that I was told that I am not the only one experiencing this issue, this looks like a financial problem, that, for a service closest resembling a bank, should be the biggest possible failure, that even creates a risk of collapsing. I was also referred to a company in Malta, with whom I would have to spend further money for them to open up a complaint, as if I was insufficiently communicating. I ignored this suggestion, conversation has been closed, and now, I am looking at the situation again. From my point of view, the service has shown no respect for my money or my time. I find it not morally right at all to call yourself an exchange that holds money, like a bank, relying on the trust of strangers, while deep in terms and conditions hiding that you may refuse to give the money as if it was yours. I believe this constitutes fraud, and that the previously pointed out part of their terms and conditions is a cheap and illegal bypass, as it can be abused, and perhaps has been, to hide bankruptcy. A business struggles, this is just excusing all wrongdoings with a ‚Äúyou should have known‚Äù.  
  
  
  
  
  
Concrete questions  
What do you think would be the best next steps? Do you believe that I am right when saying such a clause deep within T&C's is illicit practice/behaviour? If so, would it amount to me building a case against crypto.com, suing for fraud, or maybe any other law? And lastly, if it did, as the loss was quite small, but the situation, to me, absurd, is there a limit that I could sue for (is it possible to sue for more than I have lost)?  
  
I would also really appreciate any pro-bono support recommendations, in English, and possible in Europe.  
  
Many thanks!

Hottest P2E Blockchain Games of 2023?,AllCryptoBets,169prs7,2023-09-04 07:41:29,5,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/169prs7/hottest_p2e_blockchain_games_of_2023/,blockchainsoldier01,DISCUSSION,"The crypto space offers various ways for users to earn rewards through blockchain, with play-to-earn games being particularly popular.

As AI, the Metaverse, and NFT-based tokens continue to gain traction, we can expect this trend to spill over into the play-to-earn blockchain space. While there are numerous play-to-earn games available, not all of them may prove to be worthwhile.

After doing some market research, I've compiled a list of the top 10 blockchain games that seem to be worth exploring:

Illuvium (ILV): A sci-fi adventure game where players collect NFT creatures and engage in autobattles across seven alien landscapes.

Alien Worlds (TLM): A sci-fi game that allows players to explore space and gather resources from various planets. It has attracted over 3.6 million users and boasts more than 700,000 monthly players.

The Sandbox (SAND): One of the premier play-to-earn games that offers players a selection of over 140,000 avatars. Players can utilize these avatars to build, own, and monetize their own virtual plots of LAND.

Axie Infinity (AXS): Considered a pioneer in play-to-earn blockchain games, Axie Infinity enables players to collect and mint NFTs representing digital pets called Axies.

Vulcan Verse (PYR): A decentralized open-world game where players can interact with various games and events. Developed by Vulcan Forged, a prominent blockchain gaming studio, this MMORPG utilizes NFTs to represent land.

Decentraland (MANA): The first user-owned virtual world, enabling users to create, explore, and purchase LAND, which represents plots in the Metaverse. Players can immerse themselves in unique environments like medieval dungeons and villages.

Battle Infinity (IBAT): An upcoming play-to-earn game known for its rewarding gameplay across six platforms. Players can participate in the IBAT Premier League, form teams, and compete for rewards. Monetizing land is another way to earn in this game.

RobotEra (TARO): A promising play-to-earn crypto game that empowers players to explore a vast virtual land, acquire resources, and generate profits.

Lucky Block (LBLOCK): A popular cryptocurrency ecosystem that recently launched a new casino and sportsbook featuring over 2,700 games, sports betting, enticing bonuses, and no fees.

Tamadoge (TAMA): An early-stage play-to-earn game with long-term potential. Its native token, TAMA, distinguishes itself as a meme coin with real-world utility. Players can earn TAMA tokens by taking care of their virtual pets through exercise, feeding, and nurturing.

What are your thoughts on this? Are there any other blockchain p2e games other than the ones mentioned here that show great promise for 2023?"

### [Market Maker GSR Faces Executive Exodus Amid Bear Market](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/market-maker-gsr-scales-back-amidst-high-profile-departures)

GSR, a well-established figure in the crypto industry, is undergoing significant structural changes amidst the ongoing crypto bear market. The company, renowned for its pivotal role in US markets, has seen departures from several high-ranking executives, including the Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Hugh. Amidst these high-profile exits, GSR is also scaling back its US operations, signaling broader challenges for the crypto sector. As the firm strategizes its next steps, the crypto winter's toll becomes evident, raising questions about the future dynamics of the market.

### [PayPal Temporarily Suspends Crypto Purchases in the UK Following New FCA Rules](https://coincu.com/210987-paypal-pause-crypto-purchases-in-uk/)

In response to new regulations introduced by the UK‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), PayPal will suspend cryptocurrency purchases for UK customers starting October 1, 2023, with plans to resume in early 2024. While the specific rules causing this suspension weren't detailed, PayPal remains committed to compliance and will take the necessary measures for adaptation. Meanwhile, customers can still hold and sell their crypto, and there are no holding fees. Amid these changes, the FCA also introduces regulations on crypto advertising. Notably, PayPal is gearing up for the launch of its stablecoin, PYUSD, in the coming weeks.

### [Illuvium's Token Crash Highlights GameFi's Struggle with Quality and Player Engagement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/illuvium-collapsing-token-problems-gamefi)

Illuvium's anticipated rise in the GameFi space is met with a sharp decline as the value of its ILV token plummets by 97%. Amidst delays and underwhelming gameplay experiences, this blockchain game mirrors the broader industry issue: a predominant focus on profitability over gameplay quality. GameFi projects, despite massive initial fundings via tokens and NFTs, are struggling to live up to the hype, with many offering little in terms of genuine gameplay experience. Illuvium's challenge not only reflects on its own operational decisions but raises questions about the sustainability and future of GameFi as a whole.

### [Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Retreat Amid Market Uncertainty](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-speculators-btc-since-69k-all-time-highs)

Bitcoin's short-term holders, a speculative segment of the BTC market, appear to be retreating as Glassnode's latest analysis indicates a decrease in their supply to a mere 2.56 million BTC, the lowest since the $69,000 all-time high in October 2021. Despite stagnant BTC price actions and the market teetering between $29,000 and $25,000, long-term holders showcase stronger conviction, now controlling an all-time high of 14.6 million BTC. Amidst the mixed signals, a clear divide is emerging between speculative and steadfast investors in Bitcoin.

### [PayPal's Crypto Reach Grows with Ledger Live App Integration](https://blockworks.co/news/paypal-ledger-integration)

Ledger, the renowned hardware wallet provider, has partnered with PayPal to allow its users to purchase select cryptocurrencies directly from the Ledger Live app. With this new integration, users can now seamlessly buy ether (ETH), bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), and litecoin (LTC) using their linked PayPal accounts. This is seen as a strategic move in the evolving crypto space, offering users more options for crypto purchases while emphasizing security and convenience. The announcement follows PayPal's recent foray into the crypto sector, including the launch of a dollar-backed stablecoin through Paxos Trust Co.

*As we wrap up today's recap, it's evident that the crypto sector is in a constant state of flux, with traditional financial giants like PayPal making major inroads. At the same time, the industry grapples with the potential pitfalls of merging gaming with finance. It's a testament to the dynamic nature of this space, and we'll continue to monitor these stories as they develop.*"

"Diving in to the Illuvium X GameStop Partnership, and the future of distribution - Robbie",Superstonk,1486ymr,2023-06-13 01:01:33,2698,0.97,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1486ymr/diving_in_to_the_illuvium_x_gamestop_partnership/,robbieimmutable,:NFT:  Gamestop Marketplace,"Hi all - Robbie Ferguson, Immutable co-founder here. I wanted to share some news about the partnership between Illuvium and GameStop and break down our long term strategy. Feel free to ask any questions and I‚Äôll be around for the next 20 to answer!

**TL;DR:** GameStop is one of the biggest digital communities on earth. With web3 this becomes a community games want to give value to - and use this to make GameStop marketplace (and more with royalties) the go-to distribution method for games launching in web3. Illuvium is taking the first stride with a custom Illuvial exclusively made for GameStop: [https://illuvium.io/gamestop](https://illuvium.io/gamestop).

(Buying one also gives you instant beta access to Illuvium Overworld and Illuvium Arena).

‚Äî

**Introducing Illuvium:** the first AAA game to be launching on Web3

First, a quick summary of Illuvium - probably the most anticipated game currently building in crypto, and one of the most funded. It's an open-world RPG adventure game built on Immutable, with all assets tradable on GameStop. They‚Äôre building three games using the same assets and IP - my favourite is their auto-battler (in beta). When they properly launch in November, they‚Äôll be the first proper AAA game to launch on web3.

Most importantly - illuvium‚Äòs value is almost completely decentralised. All value from in-game item sales etc goes back to token-holders of $ILV.

**Partnership & Long-term Strategy:** Illuvium + GameStop

We want to make GameStop the home of player-first gaming. Illuvium has created custom content for GameStop (here - [https://illuvium.io/gamestop](https://illuvium.io/gamestop) / [https://nft.gamestop.com/](https://nft.gamestop.com/)). 20,000 limited edition Illuviual D1SK. There will be a maximum of 20,000 in existence - or however many sell by end of sale (in roughly 48 hours from now).

This is a first iteration of many - but if we can make selling or launching a game through GameStop‚Äôs marketplace and community an incredibly compelling experience, we can build the largest digital community of players in the world - all fighting for better rights for players. Games will automatically choose to list content and collections with GameStop. Importantly - it doesn‚Äôt even all have to be traded on the marketplace, GME could be taking royalties on assets it creates that are enforcable \*anywhere\* players want to trade (in-game etc).

People pay apple 30% because most of the world‚Äôs valuable mobile customers use apple. How much will they value an insane distribution platform that doesn‚Äôt charge that?

**The Future**

Gaming is clearly on its way to be the first meaningful use-case of crypto outside of payments. We‚Äòre still in incredibly early days - but to give you a reference, $40B of CS:GO skins were traded since 2019 - just one game \*alone\*. Importantly, it‚Äôs done by a company which famously restricts trading with impunity. They make multiple billions every year off facilitating  ‚Äútrades‚Äù where they can change the rules on a whim, and players can never sell for real value. this is why we started this in the first place - it is unmistakably clear the future of gaming monetization should be open, player-owned and with aligned economics.

We have the opportunity to make that future on GameStop.

While there are many play-to-earn games saturating the market, not all of them may be worthwhile. After trying out games and doing a good bit of research, here are my top 10 blockchain play-to-earn games that seem promising in 2023:

1. Illuvium (ILV): A sci-fi adventure game where players collect NFT creatures and engage in autobattles across seven alien landscapes.
2. Alien Worlds (TLM): This sci-fi game allows players to explore space and gather resources from various planets.
3. The Sandbox (SAND): Players can choose from a vast selection of avatars in this game and build, own, and monetize their virtual lands.
4. Axie Infinity (AXS): Considered a pioneer in play-to-earn blockchain games, Axie Infinity lets players collect and mint NFTs representing digital pets called Axies.
5. Vulcan Verse (PYR): A decentralized open-world game where players can interact with games and events, developed by Vulcan Forged.
6. Decentraland (MANA): The first user-owned virtual world, where players can create, explore, and buy virtual lands in the Metaverse.
7. Battle Infinity (IBAT): This game offers rewards on six platforms, allowing players to compete in the IBAT Premier League and monetize land.
8. RobotEra (TARO): A promising play-to-earn crypto game where players explore a virtual land, acquire resources, and turn a profit.
9. Lucky Block (LBLOCK): A popular cryptocurrency ecosystem that recently launched a casino and sportsbook with a wide range of games and betting options.
10. Tamadoge (TAMA): A promising game with long-term potential, where players can earn TAMA tokens by taking care of their virtual pets.

This change is intended to encourage more active participation from long-term stakeholders and provide a more stable governance system for the project.

Also if anyone knows any other ones (besides Gods Unchained) please let me know!,CryptoCurrency,11hw9lb,2023-03-04 05:36:51,9,0.69,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11hw9lb/if_youre_interested_and_have_the_time_here_are/,assholeTea,DISCUSSION,"Illuvium (ILV) - Illuvium is a new open-world RPG that is currently in development. The game allows players to collect, battle, and evolve creatures called Illuvials. The game has received a lot of attention due to its stunning graphics and the fact that it is being built on Ethereum.

Undead Blocks (UBX) - Undead Blocks is a tower defense game where players defend their base against waves of zombies. The game is built on the Binance Smart Chain and features NFTs that players can earn or buy to strengthen their defenses.

WAGMI Tower Defence (WAGMI) - WAGMI Tower Defence is a beta game similar to Clash Royale where players can build and upgrade defenses to protect their towers from waves of attackers. The game features human and alien characters and is currently in beta.

Axie Infinity (AXS) - This game has been making waves in the crypto gaming world. It's a digital pet breeding and battling game that has gained a lot of attention due to its play-to-earn model. Players can earn cryptocurrency by playing the game and breeding Axies, cute creatures that can be traded on a marketplace.

Sorare (SOR) - Sorare is a fantasy soccer game that allows players to collect, trade and manage a virtual team of officially licensed players. The game uses blockchain technology to ensure that all players and teams are unique and can't be duplicated. The game has attracted a lot of attention from soccer fans and investors alike.

There is another game I wanted to add but it is not allowed to be written about, pretty much its an MMO and any NFT project can be integrated into the game as a playable character. Super cool idea and I think it has the potential to make real use cases for pretty much any NFT that is just a ""Jpeg."""

10 Promising Play to Earn Games for 2023,ethereum,114gjei,2023-02-17 05:26:07,33,0.71,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/114gjei/10_promising_play_to_earn_games_for_2023/,plxmtreee,,"The crypto space allows users to earn rewards from the blockchain in a number of ways, one of the most popular ones being play to earn games.    
Blockchain games set themselves apart from traditional video games by providing players free crypto, NFTs or other assets which can ultimately be exchanged for fiat currencies. 

With the rise in popularity of AI, Metaverse and NFT based tokens, we can expect a similar trend to spillover in the blockchain P2E space too. The market is saturated with all sorts of P2E games, a lot of which may not ultimately prove to be worth one's time and effort. However, after searching the market for a good bit, heres a quick look at my top 10 p2e blockchain games that seem to be worthwhile. 

1) **Illuvium (ILV)** is a sci-fi adventure NFT creature collector and autobattler game that enables players to explore 7 alien landscapes. Players uncover the events that shattered Illuvium and can hunt and capture over 100 deadly beasts that rule the alien territory.

2) **Alien Worlds (TLM)** is one of the best P2E games, attracting more than 3.6 million users since inception and more than 700,000 monthly players. It‚Äôs another sci-fi game that enables players to explore space and scrub various planets for resources.

3) **The Sandbox (SAND)** is of the top P2E games that enable players to choose from more than 140,000 avatars is The Sandbox. Players use their avatars to play in the Sandbox and to build, own and monetize their piece of LAND. 

4) **Axie Infinity (AXS)** many gamers consider Axie Infinity as the pioneering platform of play to earn blockchain games. This NFT game enables players to collect and mint NFTs, which represent digital pets known as Axies.

5) **Vulcan Verse (PYR)**  is a decentralized open world blockchain game where you can travel around and interact with games and events. Vulcan Forged, one of the leading platforms in this space is the blockchain gaming studio that has developed this game. The MMORPG game is built using blockchain technology and consists of land parcels represented by NFTs.

6) **Decentraland (MANA)** is the first virtual world owned by its users, enabling them to create, explore and buy LAND, a plot in the Metaverse. Players can explore LANDs to experience majestic scenery such as medieval dungeon mazes and villages. 

7) **Battle Infinity (IBAT)** proved since its presale that it would be one of the best P2E games to watch this year. The key attraction of Battle Infinity is earning rewards on 6 platforms. Players can enter the IBAT Premier League and build up teams to compete for rewards. Another way to earn is by monetizing land. 

8) **RobotEra (TARO)** is a promising new play-to-earn crypto game that puts earning opportunities directly in the hands of the people. Players can explore a vast virtual land, acquiring resources and turning a profit along the way.

9) **Lucky Block (LBLOCK)** is a popular cryptocurrency ecosystem that has just launched a new casino and sportsbook offering more than 2,700 games, sports betting, enticing bonuses and no fees.

10) **Tamadoge (TAMA)** this is a promising P2E game since its early in its roadmap with high potential in the long term. Its native token TAMA is also a meme coin that separates itself from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by having a real world utility. Players can earn TAMA tokens by exercising, feeding and nurturing their pets.

What are your thoughts on this? Are there any other blockchain p2e games other than the ones mentioned here that show great promise for 2023?"
Illuvium: Beyond Megathread! All you need to know!,illuviumio,114bb64,2023-02-17 00:08:45,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/illuviumio/comments/114bb64/illuvium_beyond_megathread_all_you_need_to_know/,Orionmango,Game Content,"# Illuvium: Beyond - A Collectible Card Game with Endless Possibilities

https://preview.redd.it/vhxb6qc2loia1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0309f0995d864513c791aec924eebf5574962154

Illuvium: Beyond is an exciting customisable collectible card game coming on March 7th that offers endless possibilities for collectors to explore and enjoy. With a vast range of unique hand-drawn Illuvitars, accessories, backgrounds, finishes, and competitive aspects, Illuvium: Beyond has something for everyone. There are also exciting possibilities for the future with the development of a casual PvP card game, which requires approval from the DAO.

# What is an Illuvitar?

Illuvitars are unique and creative versions of Illuvials that exist beyond the Illuvium Universe. Each Illuvitar is hand-drawn with three different expressions to collect. They also come with a random background and five slots for different accessories, including head, body, skin, props, and eyes.

The finish of the Illuvitar is significant because it affects the overall look of the Illuvitar. There are two finishes, colour and holo, with the possibility of more later. Each Illuvitar has a power rating determined by its rarity, and the rarity of accessories added.

**Expressions**

Each Illuvitar has three expressions to collect, each with a different rarity. Collecting all three expressions is essential to completing your album. It also gives players a sense of accomplishment and helps them climb up the leaderboard.

**Backgrounds**

In addition to the expressions, each Illuvitar has a random background with its own rarity. The backgrounds increase its power, add a distinct visual flair, and offer an additional layer of rarity to the Illuvitar.

**Accessories**

Illuvitars also have the option to customise their appearance with five accessory slots, including head, body, skin, props, and eyes. Each accessory has its own rarity level, and one accessory can be permanently bonded per slot, allowing players to create a unique and personalised look for their Illuvitar. In addition to their visual impact, accessories also contribute to the power of the Illuvitar.

https://preview.redd.it/akmfirpeloia1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0336c7160ea98162bcddffd56039612768e4811

**Finish**

The appearance of the Illuvitar is greatly influenced by its finish, which significantly impacts its rarity. Currently, there are two available finishes - colour and holo - with the potential for additional finishes to be introduced in the future. Holos are extremely rare, and their discovery is celebrated during the Launch Party.

**Power Rating**

Each Illuvitar also has a power rating, which can go over 9000! The power of an Illuvitar is determined by its rarity, and the rarity of accessories added. This power rating is a significant factor in the game's competitive aspect, as it influences the player's overall score.

# What is a D1sk?

Players can use D1sks to acquire Illuvitars and Accessories, and each contains random items. However, players can also trade D1sks with other players, giving them an opportunity to obtain rare items that they want. The trading system is open and decentralised, which means that players have more control over their transactions. Additionally, players can choose to hold onto their D1sks as they may become more desired over time, as they become rarer due to increased demand.

There are two types of D1sk, the Standard D1sk and the Mega D1sk.¬†

1. Standard D1sk **-** The Standard D1sk contains one Illuvitar, three accessories, and one Tier 0 Illuvitar.
2. Mega D1sk **-** In contrast, the Mega D1sk swaps out the T0 Illuvitar for a guaranteed rare Illuvitar. The Mega D1sk is more expensive but offers better chances of getting great things.

**What is a Wave?**

Each Illuvitars Wave contains 25 Illuvials. Tier 0 Illuvials will be available in all waves. Each Wave will last 3 months, and there will be 6 Waves in the first set, but we might sell multiple waves at the same time towards the end of the set because we want each set to last approximately 12 months.

To explore the Wave of Illuvials coming on March 7th, check it out here: [https://illuvium.io/illuvitars/illuvitar-d1sks](https://illuvium.io/illuvitars/illuvitar-d1sks).

**Alphas**

At the beginning of a wave, a time-limited sale with a fixed quantity of D1sks marked as Alpha will be held. These D1sks do not affect the gameplay, but they are likely to be more rare and highly sought after.

# What is Bonding?

Bonding is when a collector takes an Illuvitar and one or more accessories and permanently puts them together, creating a new customised Illuvitar with a higher power rating. There are billions of combinations available, meaning that the vast majority of Illuvitars will be unique. This allows collectors to personalise their collections and create something special that represents their individuality.

# Illuvium: Beyond Hub

The Hub is the central location where all the exciting events take place. Add to your collection, check out the marketplace, view your assets or leaderboards, bond your accessories, and track your progress. It is a must-add to your bookmarks for easy access.

**Album**

The album is an essential part of Illuvium: Beyond. It's where players store all of the Illuvitars they collect during their journey. The album is divided into different collections that give players something to aim for and a sense of accomplishment when completing a collection or a milestone. Additionally, players earn points that increase their rank and allow them to compete with other collectors.

**Collections**

These are pages in the album with a specific theme. The game has over 100 collections to complete, providing players with plenty of options and challenges. Some collections are straightforward, like the Illuvial Line collection, which contains all the Illuvitars in a particular line (such as the Dodo or Axolotl). In contrast, others are more specific, such as the Affinity collection, which groups Illuvitars based on their elemental affinity.

Collections are categorised into different types, including:

* **Illuvial Line** \- this collection contains all of the Illuvitars in a particular line.
* **Accessory Line** \- this collection contains all the Accessories in a line, but first, you must bond them to an Illuvitar.
* **Background Line** \- this collection contains all the Backgrounds in a line, so you must hold an Illuvitar with those backgrounds.
* **Affinity** \- this collection groups Illuvitars based on their elemental affinities, such as Water, Nature, and Fire.
* **Class** \- this collection groups Illuvitars based on their roles in the game, such as Fighter, Bulwark, and Rogue.
* **Set** \- this collection groups Illuvitars based on the Set they came from.

**Milestones**

These are checkpoints that players can reach by completing specific goals. They are an excellent way to earn Album points, track your progress, and motivate you to keep playing. Milestones are essential for collections because they provide players with a clear objective to aim for.

Each collection has its own milestones, which are related to the collection's theme. For example, the Illuvial Line collection has six milestones: three for the Illuvials in the line and three for the different expressions. If you collect all expressions of one Illuvial, you complete a milestone. If you collect all the rare expressions, then you have another milestone. Achieving a milestone gives players a visual representation of their progress and valuable points.

**Sleeves**

Each collection in the album contains multiple sleeves that serve as the designated spots for your Illuvitars. By placing your Illuvitars inside the sleeves, you increase your score based on their power rating. The most effective way to improve your score is by placing powerful Illuvitars inside the sleeves. Additionally, you can place the same Illuvitar in different sleeves across various collections as long as it fits. Thus, strategic planning and management of your trades and purchases are crucial for maximising the potential of your collection. If you‚Äôre feeling impatient, there is a way to place all your Illuvitars into available sleeves automatically, but it won‚Äôt be as optimised as if you do it yourself.

Be warned: If you sell your Illuvitar then it will no longer be in any sleeves and you will lose any points gained from that, as well as any milestone or collection bonuses.

# Competition

Illuvium: Beyond has a competitive aspect that allows players to compete with one another. The leaderboard tracks the top 100 players with the highest album points, allowing everyone to see who the best collectors are. Players receive a rank from Bronze to Diamond to make things even more competitive based on their album points.

**Album Points**

Every Illuvitar in the album has a power rating, which determines the number of points players receive when they add it to their collection. Completing collections and milestones also increases the player‚Äôs album points total. The more points a player earns, the higher their position on the leaderboard.

https://preview.redd.it/qvdqkib1moia1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22e1215940430c07436091e1c116bdea71b785a

**Leaderboard**

The leaderboard shows the top 100 players in Illuvium: Beyond. It's a great way to see how you measure up against the competition and what you need to do to climb the ranks. The leaderboard displays the player's username, rank, and album points, allowing players to see who the best collectors are.

**Rank**

The rank system is based on album points, ranging from Bronze to Diamond. As players accumulate points, they climb the ranks, with each rank requiring more points than the previous one. The rank system is excellent motivation to collect more Illuvitars, complete more collections, and reach more milestones. Later, players will earn exclusive borders to be used around their Illuvitars based on the rank they achieve.

# Launch Party

Join us during the sale kicking off on March 7th as we celebrate the community as they open their D1sks. There is a music player to keep up the vibe and a stream of the latest Illuvitars and Accessories found (especially the rare ones). We track the highest power found so far and who found it. And we have community and individual stretch goals to give back to the community when we hit significant sales milestones. For example, if the community purchases more than 5,000 D1sks everyone who takes part in the sale will get an exclusive emote for use in Illuvium: Arena. Individually if you purchase more than 10 D1sks you will receive a 10% off coupon for the Merch Store.

# Conclusion

Illuvium: Beyond is an engaging and competitive collectible card game that offers a unique experience to all types of players. The album is an essential part of the game, allowing players to store their Illuvitars and track their progress. Collections, milestones, album points, and the game's competitive aspect give players a sense of purpose and motivation to continue playing and improving their collections. The leaderboard and rankings add a sense of prestige and recognition for top players, giving them a reason to keep striving for greatness. With its stunning visuals, addictive collecting, and competitive nature, Illuvium: Beyond is the most exciting NFT collection on the blockchain.
