The system includes 14 guided munitions (UB) in transport-launch containers (TPK) and 2 reconnaissance-relay drones (BLA-R) in similar containers. Both types of drones are launched sequentially from an armored combat vehicle using gas-dynamic ejection.

The guided munitions carry multi-purpose warheads to strike targets, while the reconnaissance drone performs surveillance, gathers intelligence, and relays data between the munitions and the ground control station.

The armored combat vehicle houses the crew, the full set of munitions and drones, and equipment for deployment and operation, allowing mobility to and from combat positions.

The KUB-SM system is designed for mobile operations and targeting unarmored and lightly armored military vehicles, command posts, air defense systems, electronic warfare assets, logistics infrastructure, and aircraft stationed at airfields.

It can operate under various weather conditions, day and night, with wind gusts up to 15 m/s.

I really have no idea what I'm doing or how to do it. So I'm looking for a basic invest money and let someone do the work for me. So I decided I wanted to invest in the fidelity idex fund 2065 as that would be near my retirement date. And I have seen, all you do is invest as much as you can in there and in hopes of a return towards the retire year. But I'm confused on how exactly you make the money? Is it a typical stock where you buy it now when it's low and over a long time it gradually towards into more expensive stock and then after 40 years you sell all your shares of the stock? Im looking for a basic stock, not overly concerned with how aggressive it is. I just want some money for when I'm older. My career currently offers a pension and annuity, so I plan to retire from my job after 30 years and then use my gi bill for a couple more years to get a degree ans hold off from holding such. Thank you for reading and any advice. "

I'm now stuck between a Trident (and eventually tridex) or a 2.4 (and eventually stealthchanger). If anyone has experience with both the Tridex and the Stealthchanger, I would love to hear about which you prefer, how reliable each is, how finicky, etc.  
  
As the title states, I've been burned by the bambu debacle. I was skeptical about the closed source fw when i bought it 2+ years ago, but decided to take the risk, and now they've decided to fuck everyone over.  
I'm a pretty capable diy-er, and know my way around foss, so I def think building a voron is doable for me.

Which brings me to my main concerns: I need to be able to print with things like pa/pa-cf, pc, abs/asa, etc. I'm not looking to print anything crazy like PEEK or whatever, but I do need to be able to print some of the more advanced filaments reliably. I also need to be able to print with separate support materials for breakaway/dissolvable supports. For the multi-material support, I'm open to a number of solutions, be it an AMS clone, a toolchanger, IDEX, or whatever else, as long as it's reliable.

What mods would I need to consider in order to meet these requirements?"

All for the low, low price of $3000-$4000 w/enclosure and some assembly needed - yikes!

Until now, I never actually saw how quickly it does the toolhead swaps, but check this out:

https://i.redd.it/nblkskjpmsde1.gif

That's it. Color/Material changed. Now, imagine the next Bambu printer with even just two of these, using the AMS to cut, unload, load, and purge as needed while the other is printing. Still a near similar amount of purging for 3+ colors/materials, but two colors would be near waste-less, and time saved would be through the roof.

Though I'm sure they did, I'm hoping Bambu took a good look at what they did here for their next printer, because I'm in love with what I see."

"Really Like Qidi, but the shipping cost here... Is the cost still worth it?",QidiTech3D,1i1mndq,2025-01-14 20:51:39,1,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/QidiTech3D/comments/1i1mndq/really_like_qidi_but_the_shipping_cost_here_is/,Born_Pack_164,Questions,"This post is both a rant and asking for printer suggestion. I am looking to buy my first home use printer. I really like what I have seen from Qidi, but the shipping cost is so high I am not sure if it is worth it anymore. From where I am, Southeast Asia, Q1 Pro is 549 USD, including the 100 USD shipping, while Plus 4 is 999 USD, including 200 USD shipping.  
  
I had many experiences with X1C and IDEX printer in my previous workplace. Now that I left that company, I am looking to buy my own printers now. I mostly design functional part with ABS/ASA, but I do tend to test prototype with PLA first. Especially because X1C does not have a heated chamber, I want to see exactly how much better the heated chamber printer is in term of both speed and strength.

If the shipping cost is free, I would hand down go with Plus 4, because of its extra beefy component, better nozzle wiper design, and looks way better than Q1 Pro. But because the shipping fee on both machines are around 20% of overall cost, I have considering other printers like K1C or even Infimech TX.

From where I am, I can get K1C combo (K1C + nozzle kits with 4 nozzles + 2 PLA filament + filament dryer) for around 569 USD with free shipping, which I think is insane value. Alternatively, I can go with Infimech TX, which is pretty much K1C but with smaller community, for 399 including shipping.

I want to ask do you think they are still worth it at this price point, or should I go with other printers."

I can't get the pom wheels on the z axis (either side) to spin freely anymore. I could go on...
  I have seen groups taking the SV06 & SV06+ and upgrading them to corexy or AWD machines. This looks amazing! Can anyone tell me about upgrade options you have seen for the SV07+ ?  Please keep in mind that it is only worth a couple hundred bucks.  I don't want to spend hundreds on a new printer but I have tons of free time on my hands and am very interested in learning all the ins and outs of 3D printers.  
   I am saving up for a Voron Trident and one day want an IDEX printer.  For now though I would really like to get this printer to be reliable at least.  Any suggestions and/or thoughts would be appreciated! "

Just want to get an opinion on should this be fine or do I need to upgrade one of the components to improve gameplay. Mostly play beatsaber for exercise. Have the Index and 3 base stations setup in the living room that I hook up to a 3080ti laptop with an intel i9, but like to just have a permanent setup.

Specs:

GPU: Evga 1080 FTW hybrid ( Hoping the pump still works was sitting in a box for a while when I upgraded to 3000 series.)

Cpu: Ryzen 3700X (AIO 240 rad to cool)

Ram: 32gm ddr4 3200

Storage: Samsung 870 1tb m.2

  
I got my idex after I had my 3000 series gpu so never tried it on a 1080, spec wise it meets the min requirement just not sure it will be as smooth as my current systems. I also recall intel systems ran better vs the first generations of ryzen for vr, but I think by the 3700 series that was fine. I do have an old i7 8700k system I could use if that might give better cpu performance, as i recall that one could overclock to 5ghz with the aio and be stable.

Anyway if I could get some opinions on if this should be fine or should I not just bother putting the parts back together. "

***Tuesday (4am West Coast Time)***

 *Damn, you may suck ass at infiltration, but I do like your survival instincts, Ranger Rick,* Peta smirked to herself, as Sebastian (or Bass…or Two-Three as he was presently designated) kept sweeping the room with his eyes, searching for her. Well, not her specifically, but even hours after her quarry had returned to their BoO apartment (where Peta came shadow-to-face with every other person in their operation), it was Sebastian who kept scanning the room as if his sixth sense was warning him that *the* ultimate predator was close by.

Thanks to her intel, she’d known before ever laying eyes on him that he’d been a former Texas Ranger who’d moved interstate to go into the private sector. There was definitely a story there, one that might have mirrored her own removal from her original stomping grounds of LA a few years ago. The hat might have retired while he was at work, but he still liked his oversized belt buckles. Depending on how things turned out, she might even look him up and ask him out when all this was over.

Had she mentioned he was cute?

At the time, she’d felt a twinge of guilt that the lookout she’d zotted in the foyer had been sent out for unnecessary blood tests, but at the end of the day, it was only a needle, and he looked tough enough to handle it.

Anthony Montage had met his team at the door, with both men assuring him they were fine. Peta knew he knew that. Any leader worth their salt would’ve been glued to the comms, but it was good that he cared enough to confirm it with his own eyes as soon as the opportunity presented itself.

It did beg the question of why he had been left behind when his team had been sent into the lion’s den, though. That wasn’t how she’d have handled the situation at all.

But as the men embraced, Peta drifted through the shadows and identified Maxine Shaw and Echo One in the war room, as well as three others sleeping in one of the two adjoining apartments. They were Team One. No one else was in attendance.

Maxine was pretty much what Peta expected of a Comms Officer who was a second-generation techno-geek. She was in her mid-twenties, slender, and focused over eighty percent of her attention on her system despite the fact that every member of her team was now in residence. Minor indentations on her cheeks and the sides of her nose suggested long-term use of glasses, which meant she was probably wearing contacts now.

Echo One was definitely an interesting character. His youthful appearance contradicted the knowledge and experience behind pale grey eyes that reminded her of too many Nascerdios. She’d thought she’d seen him staring directly at her more than once but had dismissed it half an hour ago after he’d accidentally scratched his arm against the sharp edge of the table. The laminate in the rental apartment had come away from the timber underneath and caused a thin laceration to appear across the back of one knuckle.

Peta saw her opportunity and moved between the shadows until she reached out a shadow-like tendril without drawing attention. She dragged it across the surface, then dragged it back into the shadows for further analysis. Shifting the tendril back into her fingers, she rubbed them against her thumb, sniffing and then tasting the substance for good measure.

*Definitely mortal mass, and not a hint of essence.* 

As she watched, she learned they worked for Portsmith Electronics, the very same company Helen Portsmith had claimed her husband’s receptionist was trying to destroy from the inside. She had personally never heard of the company before tonight, but it was enough to get the broad strokes. The company was freaking out and covering its proverbial ass, and she couldn’t blame them.

Helen Portsmith was one shady piece of work, and that coming from a divine shadow-walker was saying something.

From her hiding place, Peta listened to their private conversations and what they were doing to get a real feel for this unit and their agenda. She was both pleased and miffed to see the footnotes of her LAPD career had taken up one of the comms woman’s many screens.

Pleased: because their Comms Officer cheered at several of her arrests that had been *barely* this side of legal when the douchebags involved had seen her as a woman to be manipulated and threatened.

Seriously, had that ever worked in anyone’s favor when they were being arrested? The threat of her ‘dying in a Mexican brothel’ part was what had cost one particular perp his balls, though, for the record, he suffered advanced testicular cancer.

(In hindsight, maybe giving him all the physical symptoms of genital herpes triggered by sunlight might have been a tad OTT, but meh. He was still breathing, and given he’d been her first encounter of that type since switching to *that* side of the law, he should be grateful.)

And Miffed: because somehow these guys had access to the LAPD database and accessed HER file! Where the fuck was Nuncio? He *literally* existed to be all over this crap.

Satisfied she had the answers she needed for the moment, Peta extended the range of her shadow movement, pouring out of the one cast by the hood of her reading lamp in the living room cast against the back wall (which had been placed in that position precisely for that reason).

*Home.*

After the crap that went down in LA, Houston had become her new home. She loved her apartment and secretly adored that she was the only one, apart from people working late and cleaners, who could appreciate that gorgeous city view more than sixty stories above the ground every night. It had taken some finagling to get the proper permits to live in what was otherwise deemed ‘office space’, but her family were nothing if not creative when it came to getting what they wanted.

There had been one guy who’d thought he could extort money from her in exchange for making the rezoning ‘a smooth transition’. Unfortunately for him, he’d made the fatal mistake of attempting to blackmail her while her father happened to be following her from the shadows (of all the days for that prick to stick his nose into her business).

Peta hadn’t known he’d been there. Likewise, she hadn’t needed to ask what happened to the government official who went missing straight afterwards because she’d been forced to endure one of her father’s iconic meltdowns for not being the one to rip the guy’s head and spine from his body the way he’d taught her.

But that was ancient history, and tonight she had so much more on her mind. Barely giving the view a second glance, she zoomed in on her open laptop, which was still sitting on her coffee table.

It had been an age since she’d taken a life for personal or even professional gain (though a couple of individuals had certainly pushed that resolve in recent times), and her father lived in eternal hope that she would one day return to his dark fold with the rest of her siblings and nieces and nephews.

*No, thank you.*

It was nice to go to bed without fresh blood on her hands.

She grabbed a beer from the fridge and returned to the laptop, not surprised in the least that as soon as her ass hit the sofa, her system lit up with her cousin’s face (bypassing her need to accept his call).

“So, how’d it go?” Nuncio asked, his eyes sparkling mischievously.

“They had my fucking file, you ass!” she shouted at him.

“Did they?” he asked innocently. “Shit, sorry. Mom’s got me stuck in Puerto Rico, and the only internet I’ve got with me is my phone.” He leaned to one side and pivoted his phone to reveal three sides of an office without a monitor in sight.

Peta winced. That would be like her a hundred years ago, being stuck on a job somewhere with only a toothpick. “No harm. I was just surprised to see these guys with my LAPD records up on their screens.”

“Soooo, back to my original question. How did it go?”

“Still working on it,” she admitted, taking a pull of her beer even as she slid her feet to one end of the sofa and leaned on her elbow to still see the screen. “But you were right. Those assholes were stealing the credit for my fucking work. It looks like it was an innocent play to give them access to this other woman, but I’ll stay on it for a while. The guy who claimed to have retrieved the Lion had no clue what he was talking about, and I want the idiotic genius who put him up to it.”

Nuncio bobbed his head in thoughtful agreement. “Do you want me to hack things from my side and see what I can dig up?”

“Nah, I’ve got it from here. Thanks again for the heads up.”

“Always, cuz. You know where to find me if you need me.”

Peta nodded and reached forward to close the screen with the bottom edge of her beer bottle, knowing Nuncio would terminate the call from his side if that motion didn’t automatically sever the connection. She then rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling, mulling over the problem as she saw it.

\* \* \*

Nuncio hit the disconnect button, then clapped and wriggled and giggled until he was delirious from his triumph. He’d deliberately dragged his chair to the other side of his desk so she wouldn’t see the wall of monitors that usually sat behind him. Even though they only showed footage of the worksite, Peta would know he could have manipulated their feeds to see anything he wanted.

He hadn’t technically lied to her, though. As much as he wanted to oversee what was going on in California himself, there was only so much he could do with his phone from Puerto Rico, so putting a former world-class assassin in four-inch stiletto heels over there was the next best thing. And for the *coup de grace,* all he’d had to do was send her the link to the site he himself had created, and her own righteous indignation had taken care of the rest.

She’d forgive him when she found out *he* was the *evil* genius she was looking for …

*… eventually.*

***Tuesday***

*What the fuck is wrong with that guy?* Boyd shook his head, reclaiming his seat behind his workbench. He’d never thought of Larry as the clingy type, but ever since he’d let—

He paused.

Well, no, he hadn’t *actually* let Larry stay in the apartment. Larry was *Robbie’s* divine bodyguard. He’d be there whether Boyd wanted him to be or not, but damn, he hadn’t been like this on the worksites. If he’d been caught watching anyone the way he was hovering over Boyd right now … he’d have been shit-canned for life.

Boyd hadn’t been joking about the whole ‘mother-hen’ vibe, and it wasn’t the first time Larry had pulled it either. And what the hell was that hit to the back of the head all about?

His right hand automatically reached for the impact point that still thrummed. Normally he could shake that shit off, which meant the bastard had put some divine pepper into it. *Prick!*

Plus, what was that crap about his grandparents? There were no teachers …

He paused again, remembering how Robbie dropped all the ‘greats’ whenever he talked about his pop, which was just another word for grandfather. And how Robbie and Sam did the same thing when talking about God. Despite half a dozen generations separating them, they both simply referred to him as *‘Uncle YHWH’* when even Sam should be throwing in one *great.* If dropping the greats was a common state of affairs amongst the divine, then Nuncio could have meant a different ancestor from much further back.  

And God only knew what his ancestors five or ten generations back did for a living. He certainly didn’t.

Maybe he’d made a mistake offering Larry the job of running the business side of his company. Before, they’d been friends and workmates. They’d gone out, had drinks, and been bros. Now, Boyd’s company was fledgling, and Larry seemed to be taking it personally to ensure it succeeded. Boyd didn’t need that, and he was sure Lucas didn’t either. It wasn’t as if Larry was hard-up for money and needed the job. It was just a front to keep himself occupied while looking out for Robbie.

If anything, Boyd felt a little used by the situation.

Slamming the brakes on that train of thought, Boyd severely chastised himself. Fuck, Larry was right. He was looking for problems to poke holes in his perfect situation. Larry was his best friend outside the apartment, and his best friend now had the job of looking out for his roommate. It was a bonus that Larry had spent at least a century amongst the humans and knew what it took to run a successful business. He was perfect for the role, and if he came across as a worrywart from time to time, it was only because he cared. Could Boyd honestly say he wouldn’t be the same if their roles and skill sets were reversed?

*That’s it!* He shot up from his seat. *That’s what’s changed.* Before, they were both getting their pay from a nameless company that neither of them really cared about. But now, Boyd’s financial future depended not only on how well he could carve but also on how well Larry managed his books. If Larry dropped the ball, he’d be personally responsible for Boyd’s financial ruin.

*That’s why he’s suddenly acting like I need bumper rails on my life. He feels responsible for it!*

Well, that wasn’t gonna fly. *Hell, no.*

Boyd packed up his tools, then dropped to one knee behind his work bench and reached into the footwell for the biometric safe he’d bought himself first thing that morning. Sam’s suicide attempt with his tools had been enough to keep him awake long after he’d crawled back into bed with Lucas, and ever since he hadn’t been able to shake the memory for long. It didn’t matter that Sam was a hybrid—those tools were divine constructs … and had anyone bothered to ask if that meant their damage was longer lasting? No. How Sam had retained all his fingers (or even his whole hand at one point) would be a mystery for the ages!

The door to the safe silently swung open once he pressed his thumb to the scanner, and he deposited the roll inside and closed the door, giving it a pat for good measure, reminding himself to put Lucas’ print in the safe as well, just as Lucas had added his to the gun safe in the bedroom. Then he straightened up and headed into the bathroom to wash his hands and brush his hair and teeth. *At least I don’t need to brush myself off anymore,* he mused to himself.

Recently, he’d noticed none of the wood filings were clinging to him like a second skin the way they had in the beginning, which was a huge time-saver for clean-up afterwards. Lucas had spent ages combing and picking out each piece of wood from his hair and stubble those first few nights, only to have more inserted the following day.

He’d thought Lucas was getting quicker at removing it each time, but no, on the occasions when he’d taken stock of himself in front of a mirror after working, he’d noticed less and less shavings were stuck to him. As of yesterday morning, there were none at all. He still smelt like he’d been working with timber, but that couldn’t be avoided since timber resin was like any other sticky liquid being worked with.

The lack of chips in his clothes had to be making Robbie happy, too, though the sweetheart hadn’t once complained about it.

He smiled right up until he remembered what Sam had told them at breakfast, and then his expression fell into a frown. *Yeah, that shit’s going to be stopped quick-smart, too.* He’d always believed Robbie was doing too much around the house, but there were only so many times and so many ways the residence’s domestic hybrid could shout him down without proof before he simply let Robbie win.

*Not gonna happen now.*

He’d declare war and commandeer all the housework himself before letting Robbie go another day thinking that crap.

Or (with two full floors in play) he’d pull his weight and kick everyone else into line to do theirs, too, if he had to.

*Damn, Larry’s right about that, too.* He got to do what he loved doing; everyone else was running after him, and he *still* thought he had the right to complain.

He leaned forward with his eyes closed and lightly tapped his forehead against the mirror. *Idiot.* He’d smack *himself* in the back of the head with the same force as Larry had used if he could. He tapped twice more, then pulled back and reached for the deodorant he left on a narrow shelf above the mirror. The last thing he wanted was to meet Eva Evans smelling like a lumberjack, though he kept it to a quick spritz before returning the can to the shelf and giving himself a onceover in the mirror.

Not the greatest, but it would do.

No way in the world was he about to knock on Eva Evans’ door looking anything less than presentable.

Five minutes later, he stood outside her door and breathed through his nerves. It wasn’t as if he was meeting one of his personal movie icons (he’d almost offer up his firstborn for ten minutes with Vin Diesel. The three Riddick movies were still his favorite movies of all time, and he was looking forward to the fourth one that had been promised, if and when *that* ever happened), but Eva Evans was a classic of a bygone era that held a pedestal all her own: Like Sean Connery.

If anything, he felt a little bit stupid coming down here to talk to Larry. Yes, they needed to get a few things straightened out, but what was the rush? He’d had Larry all to himself for most of the morning, and following him down here like this just made him sound needy. If sweet old Mrs Evans really was Eva the former mega-star, why was he horning in on their time together?

He lowered his hand and stepped away, convinced more than ever that this was a huge mistake. He should get back to work. There were so many people waiting for their carvings and…

…and…yeah, he should just …

As he turned to leave, the door opened, and the elderly woman he could see was clearly *the* Eva Evans looked up at him. “Sorry, handsome, but you were taking so long just standing there that I figured I’d put both of us out of our misery and pretend you knocked. My legs aren’t as young as they used to be you know, and standing there waiting for you to figure things out was killing me.”

She chuckled at his stunned silence, then beckoned him in with her free hand. “Come on in, Boyd. I haven’t had this much company in years and two strapping young men to boot. Back in my day, that would’ve set tongues wagging for sure.”

“It’s not such a big deal these days, Mrs Evans…”

“Eva, please.”

Since Boyd only had on flipflops, he kicked them off in the alcove and followed the frail-looking woman into her living room, taking in all the dated décor and the autographed movie posters. “Wow,” he said, absorbing the bygone era.

“You think that’s something. You should see what Eva’s got squirrelled away back here,” Larry called from the room that would have been Sam’s old room upstairs.

Boyd looked at Mrs Evans, who waved him through. “Go ahead, hun’. You boys can be trusted not to run off with my old awards.”

*Old awards—* “Wait…are you talking about your Oscars?”

“And her Academy Awards, *and* her Hollywood Walk of Fame plaque, *and* a heap of others. That’s why I’m starting with the trophy cabinet,” Larry answered. “The cabinet they’re currently in is horrendous.”

“Remember, you promised to give me an itemised account,” Mrs Evans called out as Boyd eased his way around her, shaking with excitement to see the iconic trophies with his own eyes.

Boyd stood in the doorway, staring at the god-awful glass cabinet that belonged in the nearest dumpster ASAP. His brain switched gears as he looked around the room, cataloguing what needed urgent repair and what could be done afterwards. He went over to where Larry was lifting out a giant feminine Oscar and gingerly placing it on the floor beside several others.

“You aren’t seriously charging her, are you?” he whisper-hissed.

“Of course I am,” he answered loudly, even though his eyes widened, and he shook his head ever so slightly. “Eva wants to pay for everything we use, so at the end of this, I’m giving her an itemised account…*at fifties prices,”* he added on a breath of a whisper. “Isn’t that right, Eva?”

“Absolutely, and none of your sneaky shenanigans either, young man,” she said from the hallway, proving there was nothing wrong with her hearing, and she had indeed been listening in. “I’ll be watching you.”

Larry turned and, tilting his head to give Eva a puppy dog look, painted a cross over his heart with his finger.

“Stop that, you rascal, before I put you in the corner for a time-out.”

Larry cackled, and Eva shook her head at him.

Between the awards and Larry’s fanboy behavior, Boyd wasn’t sure which freaked him out the more.

Something dinged loudly in the kitchen, and Mrs Evans left them to deal with it.

“Want to know an interesting fact?” Larry asked quietly so as not to be overheard.

“What?”

“Purchase prices for apartments in Manhattan during the fifties were only eight bucks a square foot.”

Boyd’s jaw fell open. “No. Way.”

Larry waggled his eyebrows. “Yes, way. Seventy bucks a month would get you a fully furnished four-bedroom apartment. Seventy-five, and there was usually a hot meal thrown in.”

“The wages had to be shit back then too, though.” When Larry screwed up his face and shook his head, Boyd blinked at him. “You’ve gotta be kidding.”

“They obviously weren’t today’s wages, but on average, people only spent one tenth of their wage on rent, which usually ran with one income per household. You tell me what that ratio is today.”

“One *wage* couldn’t cover it.”

“Exactly.”

“What are you two whispering about?” Eva asked, coming back into the room with a large plate of four freshly made scones, halved with a healthy spread of jam and cream over each.

“Eva, we talked about this,” Larry growled. “You don’t have to feed us…”

“And you don’t have to do the work, yet here we are. So, get those hackles down and say thank you, young man.”

Boyd helped himself to one if only to one-up his flabbergasted friend. “Thank you,” he parroted. However, as he took his first mouthful, the base was a completely different consistency to what he was used to, and it must have shown on his face.

“Scones are supposed to be fluffy and buttery. Those bricks you lot call scones should be laid as paving stones as far as I’m concerned, and that’s a hill I’ll happily die on.”

Boyd finished off the half with a second bite. “You won’t hear me arguing, ma’am,” he grinned once he swallowed and licked the crumbs off his fingers.

Larry groaned and reached for one as well. “When did you have time to make these?” he asked suspiciously.

“I made them early this morning. Call it a hope, but I had a feeling I’d be seeing you before lunch. Three minutes in a low oven, and they’re back to warm the way they’re meant to be.”

“Stubborn old coot,” Larry griped.

“Takes one to know one,” Eva sing-songed as she left the room again.

Boyd snickered, and Larry glared at him.

***Tuesday***

After Robbie came in with snacks for their mid-morning break, Lar’ee decided ten in the morning was ample time for Eva to be up, and he was keen to make a start on her trophy room. He left Boyd’s office and moved down the hallway to where Boyd was sitting behind his workbench with his newest creation forming in front of him.

He was already over halfway through the carving, and it wasn’t the same one he’d been working on an hour ago. He was getting quicker with each one without losing any of the quality. If anything, it was increasing, as it should. It was satisfying to see him so laser-focused on a task while still exuding equanimity, and it brought a smile to Lar’ee’s face to finally see him where he belonged.

“What are you looking so happy about over there?” Boyd asked, without taking his focus from the carving.

“I like this look on you,” Lar’ee admitted.

Boyd did a slow pan, even as his hands finished several more passes before the blades were lowered to the bench. Using both hands simultaneously to save time was another new development. “You are ten seconds from getting one of these thrown at your head,” he growled in warning. “And I’ll do it, too, because I know you’ll survive it.”

Lar’ee chuckled and moved closer to the bench. “It’d be a sad day when a knife kills me.”

“Yeah. I guess only unopened soda cans have that privilege, huh?”

Lar’ee’s smile fell away. “Ever had one rammed down your throat?”

Boyd’s chuckle broke the faux tension. “Seriously, though, what are you talking about?”

“You, pal. You’re not stressed out anymore. You’re in your element here, and it shows. Peace is a good look on you.”

Boyd looked at the carving before him. “Do you ever wonder *‘what if’?”* he asked without looking at him.

Lar’ee frowned. “What do you mean?”

“Mom hated me carving. She called it ‘artsy’ and a complete waste of my time. She destroyed every carving she ever found and made my life hell for days afterwards to make sure I hated it as much as she did. I keep wondering how different things would be if she hadn’t done that.”

Lar’ee hadn’t been there then, but knowing what he now knew about the big guy, he could guess the woman’s motives, as vile as they were. “You shouldn’t spend too much of your time on that,” he said, placing a hand on Boyd’s shoulder. “What she did was wrong, but whether you like it or not, it was a cornerstone that had you making the choices that led you to your life today.”

At Boyd’s doubting look, Lar’ee went on to explain. “If she had encouraged you to take up carving professionally instead of pushing you into *her* career, you wouldn’t have failed a medical that you had no intention of putting yourself through. They wouldn’t have found out you preferred men over women because you would have already moved out and left them first. Then you wouldn’t have taken all those pills that got you shipped off base to your aunt and uncle in New York, which led you all the way to Lucas’ doorstep.”

Boyd let out a huff. “I know. It’s just … I’m nearly thirty, and I’m only just getting started. How good could I have been if I’d started fifteen or even twenty years ago?”

“You would be no better than you are right now, I promise you.”

Boyd’s smirk was weak. “Thanks.”

Lar’ee cuffed him across the back of the head, *hard.* “Cut that out,” he snapped as Boyd yelped and rubbed his head, leaning away from his friend with a venomous scowl. Lar’ee pointed at him accusingly. “That has always been your problem. You’re so used to being on the bottom looking up that it’s your default setting. Yes, things could be better for you in an ideal world, but guess what? They could be better for everyone else too, and newsflash: no one cares. Where you are right now is all that matters, and you’re wasting your good fortune wishing for more when most people would think you’ve got a pretty sweet deal here. Get the fuck over yourself, man, before I smack you upside the head again on principle.”

Boyd’s indignation lessened with each angry word until a thoughtful expression took its place. “Wow,” he finally said, rubbing the back of his head once more. “I’m sure glad you weren’t my shrink back when I was seventeen. I don’t think I’d have survived it without brain damage.”

Lar’ee shrugged, folding his arms. “Warrior, not healer.”

The two stared at each other for several seconds until Boyd eventually breathed out heavily and shook his head. “I’m not ungrateful,” he said to break the silence. “I’m not. I’m just trying to figure out why Mom hated it so much. I mean, I was using a blade, for fuck’s sake, not a paintbrush.”

He picked up a sloyd knife and rolled it through his fingers, executing dozens of stabbing motions while making it appear as if the blade was floating in his hand rather than being controlled. It was beautiful to behold, and even Lar’ee appreciated the skill.

“It’s not needlework. I could easily kill with this.”

“Except you’re not a killer. It’s not you.”

“That’s not exactly the point I’m trying to make here. No one could beat me in a knife fight. They’d never see my blade coming.”

“Did it ever occur to you that maybe you were never destined to be a soldier?”

“Yeah, the day I failed the psych eval.”

Lar’ee hissed and raised his hand as if to hit him again, and Boyd leapt off his stool in the other direction, putting it and the workbench between them. At least he was laughing, so that was an improvement.

“Damn, man. You used to be able to take a joke.”

“Seriously, though. Not all of your family are soldiers. Your grandmother was a teacher before she married your grandfather. Maybe you take after her side of the family.”

Boyd’s amusement evaporated, and he straightened where he stood. “What?”

*Oh, shit.* “Okay, fine. I might’ve done a bit of digging into your background, but in my defence, it wasn’t that hard. I was worried about you.”

“You got Nuncio to dig into my past?”

It was Lar’ee’s turn to be suspicious. Something in Boyd’s tone warned him all was not as it should be. “Something like that, why?”

‘It’s not like him to fuck up information.”

Lar’ee reeled. *“What?”*

“My grandmother on my dad’s side was a military wife straight out of high school, and on my mom’s side, she was a secretary for a carpet cleaning firm before she married my grandfather. Neither of them were ever teachers.”

*Oh. Right.* “Well, maybe it was further back than that. My point stands that there is more in your ancestry than you think, and you shouldn’t fixate on one aspect.”

“Yeah, I s’pose.” He then seemed to think of something else. “Hey, did you want something before? You never answered…”

“Actually, I was thinking of going downstairs for a while and helping Eva with some apartment renovations.”

Boyd shook his head. “I still can’t believe Eva Evans has been living downstairs from us all this time. That’s nuts.”

“No, what’s nuts was that dear old lady struggling down those dangerous stairs carrying a basket of dirty clothes *and* her cane to use the basement laundry.”

Boyd’s head bobbed in agreement. “I saw the repairs you did there. What was the glaze you used?”

“Tsuchigumo webbing, sealed in salamander heat.”

Lar’ee almost laughed at the way Boyd’s mouth opened, yet no words came out. “That’s …. not a local product, is it?’ he finally asked.

“No. A tsuchigumo is a creature from the Takama-ga-haran realm. A giant *spider* … of sorts.”

“And I’m assuming the salamander in question isn't the earth breed of lizard?”

“No. The Olympian variety.”

“Wow. And you can just … pull all that shit out of your ass at will?”

Lar’ee arched an eyebrow because did that question really bear answering?

“Right.”

“So, you’re good up here if I go down?”

“For fuck’s sake, Larry. Yes, I’ll be fine. Are you sure there’s no ‘mother hen’ in your ancestry amongst all those feathers of yours?”

Lar’ee flipped him off and realm-stepped away. If Boyd thought he was being a mother hen now, fuck help the big lug if he ever decided to leave without letting anyone (preferably him) know where he was going.

He reappeared outside Eva’s door, drawing a deep breath and exhaling it to clear his mind. Boyd wasn’t stupid. He hadn’t survived ten years on construction sites by being stupid. So maybe he should pull back a little and give the big guy some breathing room. It wasn’t as if he didn’t have enough on his plate.

Deciding that was probably for the best, he raised his hand and knocked.

Coarseness/timer adjustment help (Eureka Crono),espresso,1hwmdm6,2025-01-08 10:12:05,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hwmdm6/coarsenesstimer_adjustment_help_eureka_crono/,BeckerHollow,Dialing In Help,"Hello, I just got gifted a Calphalon Temp IQ so ending up upgrading my Bodum Bistro to a Eureka Crono. 

Since the coarseness setting has no idexing and will spin like 7 rotations before either being completely loose or completely tight, I don't really know where to begin. Thought I would just tighten as much as possible and start dialing back from there but it won't even grind - just make noise and nothing comes out. Hopefully I'm not breaking it. But the finest grind I can get out the grinder - to my untrained eye - is barely finer than my Bodum. Still enough to choke the machine though. 
Should I just back it up 3.5 rotations and that's my mid point? Seems like since it has the filter burrs I should be starting as fine as I can get? 

Also the timer dial. It took me a minute to even realize it was working. On the MIN setting it's like a second. On one dash up it seems like 5 seconds. 2 dashes and it's infinity and beyond.

Is the machine *that* sensitive, and I'm just used to the hamfisted, caveman friendly design of the Bodum? 

The espresso I've made so far is dog shit. Super bitter, black, zero crema - regardless of what I do. The beans I'm practicing with are like 4 months old. I'm still waiting on my espresso burrs - which if I can choke the machine already - what's the point?

Any advice ?"

***Tuesday***

Cora waited inside the medical lounge, though she modified her hearing to listen in on what was happening in the reception area outside. She hadn’t completely understood what Portsmith meant about having a private militia at her back until she overheard Sam’s name being mentioned and realised the man had had a run-in with the pryde at some point.

*Fucker’s lucky to still be alive.*

Of course, she knew exactly *why* Tucker was visiting Melody. At least as far as his connection to the situation was concerned. How could she not, when she’d been the one who had personally handed Alex to Noah and his team for some good old-fashioned justice?

Before they’d arrived, she’d burnt a soul brand into Alex’s leg with no added dictation so she could trace him anywhere in the realm. She’d kept her distance for a few days, but last night, she’d had the pleasure of seeing him being tortured in the basement of a dilapidated building on the other side of the Mexican border.

Credit where it was due, Melody’s father and his people were certainly thorough, and unfortunately for Alex, Noah didn’t need answers from him. This was purely revenge, where agony was the only objective, and Noah was in it for the long haul. Any good torturer knew the problem with amputation was that the body part in question would no longer be present to inflict pain. The most effective type of torture was the kind that could be reapplied at a later date.

As the Mystallian Goddess of Justice, she probably knew more than most about the satisfaction of that.

And the best part of all was because they’d taken him out of the country, by the time she’d laid eyes on him, he was officially outside her FBI ‘jurisdiction’. He would spend years paying for his crimes, and there was no doubt in Cora’s mind where his soul’s final destination would be once Noah’s rage had run its course.

Even better, focusing on Alex meant Noah Lancaster wasn’t sticking his nose into family affairs the way he’d promised Sam he would. *Win/win.* The fact that Noah and his team were known assets of Cuschler’s would not save them if they did anything to get into the divine assassin’s crosshairs.

That was when she removed the brand from Alexander Portsmith, satisfied that this would be his final resting place for whatever remained of him.

Which brought her back to her original problem. As much as she’d have loved to have ‘taken a turn’ at Alex and shown Noah how it was *really* done, she wanted the entire ring. If she followed her innate now, too many people would simply *vanish* from the world, and her sister would disapprove of that. So, for now, she stuck to the law instead of her innate sense of justice and only let her innate out to play when she had the numbers narrowed down to a select few who had managed to out-dance the law. Those would be worth unleashing her inner Highborn Hellion at.

She thought about her brief interaction with Tucker Portsmith and compared it to the video footage of the interviews from last Friday. Something had definitely changed where the man was concerned. On Friday he’d been full of righteous indignation and was determined to use brute force to get himself out from under the investigation. This time, although he still had his lawyers on speed dial, he was withdrawn… almost ashamed. In fact, the only thing that held any of his fire from Friday was when she’d asked if he should be arrested, and he’d said no.

That conversation with Kylie Lancaster confirmed her thoughts. Somehow, over the weekend, Tucker’s blinders had been taken off, and he’d seen the mess that was his family.

She almost felt sorry for him.

*Almost.*

\* \* \*

An hour and a half later, Tucker walked numbly into his office, bypassing every conversation thrown at him without a hint of response. His security team tightened around him, preventing everyone from reaching him, not that he would’ve cared if they had. The voices blended into a monotone buzz in the back of his head. One he couldn’t switch off.

At least until someone closed his office doors.

Then, there was blissful silence.

Melody had been sedated and restrained to the bed to prevent her from harming herself. Apparently, she had tried twice after learning her Master had been formally arrested, having convinced herself that it was all her fault and he would be angry with her for it; how only her pain would prove her regret and eventually satisfy him.

The sedation came into effect while he was in the room with her, for he had foolishly said the minimal odds of his son returning, given he had been kidnapped from the hospital he was in. That had her thrashing in her restraints like a wild animal. He’d thought the knowledge would help, but in her broken mind, she was convinced he *was* coming for her, and she hadn’t self-harmed enough to please him.

He’d ordered two of his guards to hold her flush to the bed while the wardsmen and, eventually, the doctors came in to sedate her. Then they’d all been kicked out of the room.

His own son had done that to a woman. His *own* son. *His* Alexander.

Kylie Lancaster had then thrown herself at him, and he’d ordered his guards to stand down, attempting to use the woman’s slaps and weak punches to somehow balance the scales that would never be balanced. Donald eventually pulled her away, and she collapsed in his arms, crying. They’d stayed until Chelsea, Kylie’s other daughter, arrived.

The hatred that poured off Melody’s older sister would have scorched him if he hadn’t already been numb.

*How did this happen? How could I be so blind?* He’d tried to give Chelsea his card, and she’d torn it to pieces and thrown it back at him as hard as she could, even though his men moved so that not a single piece struck him.

Donald had been the one to get him moving, with a gentle but firm hand on his shoulder to guide him through the hospital and out into the parking lot outside.

Both his private phone and the company one on the desk were strangely silent, which went a long way to reveal his state of mind that he was only just now realising it.

Phillipa would know how to kick his head back into the game. She’d always known what to say and do to snap him out of his funks, and his hand itched to call her.  

Except she was on the other side of the country, and if he made that call, he knew she’d be on the next plane home. He’d sent her there to keep her away from Helen, but Helen was now over there looking for her. Was there any value in leaving her over there now?

Of course, there was. Phillipa hated the public eye, and until things settled down with the company, any relationship he had with his executive assistant would be front-page news for the world, along with wording that would imply they were more than friends and boss/employee. She would be vilified as a homewrecker and master manipulator. Helen would ensure it.

One of the two bodyguards who had stayed in the reception area let himself in without knocking and approached him. He spoke to Donald first, which was good since he still had nothing to say to anyone.

Not so great was when the man then came over to him and, after taking hold of his elbow, whispered, **“You’re better than this,”** ever so quietly.

The words reached deep into his mind until he felt a slow crackle build up; not unlike the initial grab of bubble wrap being cautiously crunched and then increasing as it was twisted against itself. With each sound, his brain started breaking free of the ice and pushing the fog back into the corners until clarity settled over him again.

Helen was gone, his son was beyond his reach, and his daughter was better off where she was, but the thought of anyone going after one of his closest college friends had the dragon in him reemerging.

He would bring Phillipa home, but first, he had to fight to stabilize the empire he’d made. The empire Phillipa believed in enough to take on significant stock shares.

He’d let enough people down.

He’d be damned if he’d add one more to that tally.

Especially one who meant so much to him.

Turning sharply on his heel, he went back to his door and threw it open, scaring the hell out of his temporary receptionist – whoever she was. “Full executive office meeting in my office in five minutes. Have anyone who says they can’t make it call me directly,” he ordered, then closed the door before she could answer.

He was done with taking the back seat in his own life.

\* \* \*

The guard returned to his spot outside the office doors, his expression stoic, his hands clasped behind his back, as the executive officers and their assistants streamed into Mr Portsmith’s office one by one.

A minute or so later, he gestured at the other guard, implying he needed a bathroom break. After receiving a confirming nod, he left the reception area and headed for the nearest restroom.

As soon as he was inside, he checked to see if anyone was using the room. Once the space was clear, he created a ‘closed for cleaning’ sign on the door and locked it behind him.

He strode purposefully over to the basins and removed his earpiece, leaving it on the tiles between the vanities. Then he realm-stepped to a well-furnished office in Washington DC, where a man identical to him slept peacefully along a three-seater couch.

Standing in front of the couch, the awake guard liquified and reformed into an entirely different man, taller and thinner, now dressed in a janitorial outfit. Without a word, he took the sleeping guard by the wrist and hauled him upright, sliding his hand around the guard’s waist for support and lifting him just enough to clear the floor.

“Nap time’s over, Craig. Time to go back to work,” the janitor said, realm-stepping back into the Portsmith’s staff men’s room. He took Craig over to where the earpiece was and curled the man's fingers around the nearest basin, supporting his weight at the elbows. A thin tendril shot out of the janitor’s elbow, lifting the earpiece and inserting it deftly into Craig’s ear.

The clear wristband with Craig's earpiece was still on his wrist, as the bracelet portion did not contain a tracking device. Since the exchange only lasted a few minutes, his chances of needing to speak to anyone were slim to none.

Once everything was in place, the janitor leaned close and whispered, **“Wake up.”** 

\* \* \* 

Craig Ora gasped and stiffened, his eyes wide and his legs locking under him as he tried to get his bearings.

“You okay, man?” a stranger’s voice asked behind him.

Whirling sharply on his heel, he came face-to-face with one of the staff janitors who was only inches away from him, though to the guy’s credit, he backed up quickly, raising his hands. “Easy,” he said, his tone low and respectful. “You looked like you were swaying there for a second. You good?”

Craig frowned and turned back towards the mirror, as much to keep an eye on the janitor while he checked out his reflection. *Am I okay?* He reflected on the last few seconds and realised he hadn’t moved. He’d gone to the bathroom, walked to the vanity to wash his hands, and was still standing in front of the dry basin. The janitor had been pottering around behind him the whole time.

“Yes, thank you,” he said, washing his hands.

“No problem. You have a good day, sir,” the janitor said as he pushed his mop and bucket out the door.

\* \* \*

The moment the janitor entered the janitor’s closet, he let the mop handle go and realm-stepped away, returning to the DC office. There, the male form was abandoned, reforming into the FBI Shadow Director, complete with a three-piece Valentino Garavani suit.

Cora quickly plucked her family ring off her desk and slid it onto her left ring finger, sighing with relief to have it back in place. Although the original reason for wearing it hadn’t changed, her innate had met her fear of the Elder Court head-on once she realised Alexander Portsmith’s cruelty was about to claim another victim. That she couldn’t allow, even if it were Alex’s father.

A lit cigarette formed between her fingers, which she lifted to her lips as she made her way to the large bay windows that gave her a perfect view of the country’s capital.

*Because. Fuck. Him.*

***Tuesday***

“Why are you out in Queens, Tuck?”

Martin’s accusatory tone said the COO of Portsmith Electronics knew precisely why his CEO was away from his office during business hours and on the other side of the river east of Manhattan instead.

Tucker sighed as the nameless driver dropped his hand against the indicator lever and turned into the Queens Hospital Centre parking lot. Another body mass sat in the passenger seat beside the driver, and Donald sat to his left. The car trailing behind them held the rest of his ridiculous security contingent.

With so many eyes on him, he knew it wouldn’t take his executive officers long to realise he hadn’t gone into the office like usual, but he thought he’d have more time than this.

“I’m visiting someone first, Martin.”

“You’re going to see that girl, aren’t you?”

Tucker closed his eyes for a moment. “I’ll be in the office by lunch.”

“Tucker, I get that you feel guilty…”

“Martin, stop. Just … please, stop. I’m doing this.”

“Then, at least let the security do a sweep of the building before you go in.”

With that, Tucker had had enough. “For God’s sake, Martin! It’s a public hospital, and Helen’s not even on this side of the coast anymore! What do you *think* is going to happen?”

“When it comes to that woman, I’m not taking any chances, and nor should you. Wait in the car and let the security team do a sweep first.”

“No,” Tucker growled, putting his foot down firmly on that nonsense. “I’m going in, and they can come with me. That’s how this is going to happen.”

“Why didn’t you tell me you wanted updates on this girl? We could’ve sent someone in to…”

“Goodbye, Martin. Call me back when you stop squawking like a mother hen.”

*“Wha—?!”* Tucker abruptly ended the call … and wasn’t surprised in the least when his phone rang again half a second later. He declined it. Five more times.

Donald’s phone was the next to buzz as the car pulled into a vacant parking space. He, too, pulled out his phone and dismissed the caller without uttering a word. The guy in the front passenger seat had his phone go off next. When he didn’t pick up, something must have come through their comms, for that guy went to touch his wrist while looking at them through the rearview mirror, and Donald subtlety shook his head.

Enough was enough.

“Send word to the other car: Anyone who tries to hand me their phone or override my plans over the next hour will find themselves on the unemployment line thirty seconds later. Contrary to popular belief, *I* run Portsmith Electronics. Not Martin.”

“Yes, sir,” both men in the front seat intoned. Donald merely nodded.

He waited until the second car parked in the bay opposite them. Both front ends faced each other, with the driving lanes between them, giving the second car a perfect view and allowing for a quick departure if necessary. The four men then left the other vehicle and approached his, standing at the four corners. Only then did the two men in the front get out, each one opening a door for him and Donald.  

He and Donald converged at the front of the car with the other six men walking two in front, one on either side of him and Donald and two behind. At five-eleven, he wasn’t a short man by any stretch, yet the wall of muscle surrounding him made him feel like a waterboy in the middle of football practice. He could only see what was directly in front of him because the guards walked just far enough apart to let him do so.

He went up to the front desk, not missing that all conversation had stopped around them. They probably thought he was a celebrity or something.

An older woman in her late sixties with big glasses looked up from a book she was reading. A *real* paperback book. That was an oddity these days, and he’d been so impressed by it he almost missed how alarmed she looked. “C-Can I h-help you?” she stammered, swallowing heavily.

“I’m looking for Melody Lancaster’s room.”

“I don’t think she’s having visitors, sir.”

He reached into his breast pocket and produced his card, passing it to the flustered nurse/receptionist. “If she has any family with her now, I would like a word with them. Uh, please?” he added, almost in an afterthought. “I’m only here to help.”

*That’s not entirely true, though, is it Tuck?* he asked himself as the woman stared at his card, nodded and reached for her phone.

“Someone is coming down to see you, Mister Portsmith,” the woman said, attempting to return the card.

He took it back, but only so he could pass it on to Melody’s mother.

He wasn’t expecting another man in a fundamental three-piece suit but knew this was his ‘family contact’ as the man’s eyes swept the room before they locked onto Tucker’s. As he approached, the men around Tucker tightened formation, with the nearest one holding out his hand for the newcomer to keep his distance.

“Mister Portsmith,” the newcomer said with an impressive level of indifference for someone whose whole outfit could be bought and paid for with what Tucker spent on his shoes. He reached into his breast pocket and removed a bifold, which he flipped open to reveal an FBI badge. “Could we have a word?”

Would the security have learned about the FBI’s involvement if he’d let them come in first without him? Probably, and something told him Martin would never let him live this down if he ever found out about it … which he would.

“Certainly,” Tucker said with a tight smile, even as he reached for his phone and dialled Julian.

The call almost rang out before Julian picked up. “Tuck.”

“Do you have fifteen minutes, Julian? The FBI would like a word with me.”

“Put me on speaker,” he commanded, bristling as if preparing for war. The rustle of his friend’s clothes said he was on the move, and then he heard a second handset being lifted off its cradle. “We have a situation,” Julian said to whoever was on the other line. The agent scowled as he led them from the reception area to an unused medical lounge, where a slender woman in her mid to late twenties with a red bob cut was seated on a single couch with a coffee table in front of her. Unlike the mook who brought him in here, her outfit screamed five figures, and her superlative attitude implied much more.

“Have a seat, Mister Portsmith,” she said, her ebony eyes missing nothing.

His men fanned out to form a protective half-ring around him with Donald at his left. “If it’s all the same to you, I think I’d prefer to stand.”

There was an audible click from Tucker’s phone, which meant someone else was now taking part in his conversation with Julian.

“I believe identifications are in order before we proceed,” Ainsley Kitikan said through the line.

The woman’s lips twitched, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Very well, Mister Kitikan,” she said like Tucker’s criminal attorney was an annoying insect and not one of the top litigants in his field. “My name is Cora Nascerdios, and I’m the Shadow Director of the FBI.”

Tucker’s eyes widened and went to her right ring finger, where the director rolled her hand to give him a clear view of the family-crested ring.

“Is this official or family business?” he asked, wanting to know which person he was facing.

“In this instance, it’s both.”

“Doesn’t that make for a conflict of interest?” Tucker couldn’t help himself.

“No.”

“Tucker, stay quiet and let us do the talking,” Ainsley insisted.

“Interesting that when an agent of the law asks you for a chat, your first instinct is to reach for criminal lawyers. Not even standard ones, but criminal ones,” the director commented.

“Don’t say a word, Tucker,” Julian warned.

“What do you want, Shadow Director?” Ainsley asked.

“For starters, I want to know why your son was taken.”

“We went over this in Pensacola, Shadow Director,” Julian cut in. “For several hours. My client *still* has no idea who kidnapped his son and would like him back post-haste.”

“And I didn’t ask who. I asked *why.”*

Knowing what he knew now, heat prickled at the base of Tucker’s skull, though decades as the head of a billion-dollar corporation kept his reaction internal.

Nonetheless, the shadow director seemed to know she’d struck a chord, for she leaned forward in her seat. “I think you should take that seat now, Mister Portsmith … or do you prefer Tucker?”

“Am I under arrest?”

“Should you be?” the woman shot back, even as his lawyers screamed at him to shut up.

“No,” he said, wanting to clear that fact up, if no other.

“Tucker!” Julian warned, and Tucker pressed his lips together.

“Why exactly are you here, Tucker?” the woman asked, making a show of sitting back and laying her arms along the arms of the chair and crossing her legs at the knee as if she was getting comfortable in front of an old friend.

“He doesn’t have to answer that,” Kitikan said. “And unless you’re prepared to charge him with something, this impromptu meeting is over.”

“It must be good having lawyers of their calibre on speed dial,” she said instead, and Tucker turned on his heel, putting his back to her.

“Must be good to be a law unto yourself,” he volleyed back, growing annoyed at the woman. “With your own private militia to do your dirty work for you when the law doesn’t suit.” He never looked back as he swept from the room.

“Keep walking, and don’t stop until you get into your car,” Kitikan ordered.

“Take us off speaker,” Julian said, and Tucker did so, raising the phone to his ear. “What did you mean by a private militia?”

“She’s Nascerdios. Sam’s guards are part of the same militia that protects her family from the shadows,” he answered cryptically, knowing Julian would remember the debacle Sunday morning and understand.

“Oh, shit.”

“Mmm-hmm.”

Before he could say another word, the two guards in front of him closed the gap with their hands outstretched to block a middle-aged woman with blonde hair and pale blue eyes from approaching him. “Ma’am,” one of them said warningly.

“Kylie Lancaster?” Tucker asked, recognising the woman from the many video feeds where she’d been searching for her missing daughter.

“Get out of there!” Kitikan roared, loud enough that the woman on the other side of his guards flinched.

Tucker turned the volume down on his phone so they could still hear what was happening from his side, but he wouldn’t have to endure them. “I’m so sorry for what happened to your daughter, and I-I just wanted to know if I could do anything to help. This is a public hospital. Maybe I could … she could go to a private facility with specialists that could help…”

The woman frowned. “Why would you do that, Mister Portsmith? Especially when you and your wife practically threw me out when I came to your home and then slapped me with a restraining order for asking about the relationship between your son and my missing baby.”

Tucker remembered the incident, much as he wished he didn’t. It was a few weeks after Melody had gone missing, and her mother had been adamant that Alexander was involved. The scene she’d caused at the penthouse had required police intervention.

“I was protecting my family,” he said, with none of the venom he’d used that night.

“You were protecting a monster.”

 He couldn’t even argue with that anymore, and it made him incredibly sick and more than a little tired.

She must have seen something in his expression, for her rage filtered away, and tears welled in her eyes. “Do you want to see the shell your bastard left of my precious baby girl?”

Unable to speak, Tucker nodded silently.

“Come with me.”

Things We Can Hope For In A New 2025 Model,BambuLab,1ht59pb,2025-01-03 22:28:43,5,0.69,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/1ht59pb/things_we_can_hope_for_in_a_new_2025_model/,giGGlesM8,Discussion,"I've seen some amazing changes and updates to printing lately so let's dedicate this post to what you'd want in the new Bambu that's hopefully to come this year. (Maybe they're even listening haha ;). Improvements to printing that you'd say ""This will change 3d printing forever!"" to.

I'll start but please join in to add what you'd think would be revolutionary:

1. Bed Mesh Scanning instead of probing! See the new Beacon or the BigTreeTech Eddy for what I'm talking about. It's for sale and can be used on Klipper printers RN. It even handles homing, detects temperatures, and does bed mesh WAYY faster. Beacon also has an accelerometer built in.
2. Automatic & motorized belt tightening/adjustment (like on the new K2 Plus).
3. Much higher flow on built in .4 cht nozzle with a stronger heater and maybe even a switch to .6mm cht nozzle. Almost the entirety of MakerWorld is .4 nozzle prints making a switch to a .6 nozzle take way more time for each print unless you already open Bambu Studio to modify every time. A switch to .6 standard could rectify.
4. Dehumidifier/heater built into the AMS. No more swapping out filament that's too humid! Idk about you but my AMS always  says level 5 humidity.
5. Larger bed (To print helmets for those with giant heads like myself, of course right?)
6. A bed that swivels on a 90 degree axis/gimbal. Long shot I know but imagine not needing supports because your print can rotate on it's side, or better yet your multicolor print doesn't need to color swap every layer because it just print that on the side when the rest is printed! An alternative would be a print head on the z axis.
7. Is it even possible to go faster than the Flsun T1? I hope so, throw that on the list!
8. Idex or idex upgrade path
9. Rails instead of rods
10. Able to use built in lidar to scan objects and 3d print copies of them"

***Tuesday***

Daniel managed to step out of the shower without falling over and reached for the towel that hung from a hook screwed to the back of the ensuite door. A second hook held his dressing gown, but this wasn’t a shower designed to unwind his muscles and allow him to settle in for a night of watching TV or even going to bed. It wasn’t even mid-morning, and he had to get back to work before anyone noticed he was missing. That was a difficult ask, given how much he still hurt.

Angus had started nicely enough, sharing a punch and a stab for like and as such, Daniel had been able to patch up most of his injuries with shifting, but there was still a through-and-through wound of almost an inch and a half round that perforated one of his kidneys with the precision of someone shot him with a large calibre rifle round through him.

If only Angus had. That, he could heal from.

Daniel couldn’t even remember what he’d shouted that caused Angus to end the fight so abruptly; one moment, they’d been trading verbal and physical blows and the next, he was utterly slammed into the family’s garage floor with Angus looming over the top of him in his true gryps form. It had taken a full second for Daniel to realise the reason he couldn’t move wasn’t because Angus was using his sheer size to pin him down but because Angus had driven one of his natural talons straight through Daniel’s body, skewering him into the floor like a kebab. 

The agony that immediately accompanied that realisation had been unlike anything he’d ever dealt with before, and no matter how hard he tried to mitigate it instinctively using shifting, it wouldn’t budge.

Without remorse, Angus had then lowered his feathered head and talked him through the pain as if he were explaining who won last year’s playoffs. “Breathe, Daniel,” he’d said in clear English. “Pain is as mental as it is physical. Get yourself through it and out the other side. Survival is a natural state to fall back on. Let yourself survive this.” The quiet coaxing had gone on until Daniel succeeded in shifting just enough flesh around the wound to prevent himself from bleeding to death once Angus removed his talon.

Then Angus stepped off him.

Daniel had rolled and stumbled to his feet a short distance away, his hands covering the wound front and back. He hadn’t trusted himself to say a word to his former mentor (though he was sure the stink-eye he levelled at the war commander said plenty), and instead, realm-*staggered* directly into the ensuite of his apartment. He’d collapsed on the closed lid of his toilet, closed his eyes, and focused on his breathing. *Tefsla.* That fucking bastard had run him through with tefsla!

He couldn’t say how long he’d laid there not moving, but eventually, he’d struggled to his feet and ran himself a shower. What little was left of his clothes were stripped away, and he gingerly probed the injury that he knew he was going to be stuck with for the next few months at least, maybe even as much as a year. Such was the divine power of a true gryps’ natural weapons. Not even shifting could stand up to it. He had never endured tefsla to know the time frame involved, but he’d grown up listening to the stories. At the time, he’d scoffed at the shifters’ idea of pain, assuming they’d been exaggerating like the divine often did.

Fucking hell, he was *not* thinking that anymore.

Everything worked as it should around the injury (blood and bone reconfiguring just enough to put his body on emergency life support), but the injured pain receptors made it continue to throb with the same intensity as when it was first administered.

After he dried off, he took stock of himself in the mirror attached to the door under the towel pegs, shaking his head at how he could see the toilet tank through the damned hole. He backtracked to the toilet and wound off a substantial wad of toilet paper, which he attached to his genetic material. He then shifted it into a medical gauze complete with four strips of tape before separating himself from it. He didn’t have to worry about medical creams or infections, as the mortal parasites would take one taste of his divine structure and probably explode from its purity. This wound would take whatever time it needed to right itself, and it couldn’t come soon enough.

Repeating the process gave him a second gauze for his back, and only by poking or using some manner of visual enhancement would someone know there was a fatal wound under the gauze.

Accepting there was nothing else for it, he went to grab his things from the scraps that remained of his clothes, only to remember he’d taken them all off for safekeeping back when he’d stupidly agreed to face off with his old mentor. *Fuck!* He really didn’t want to return to the garage and risk running into Angus, but he needed his stuff for work!

Gritting his teeth at the pain, he slammed out of his ensuite, passing a second vanity (which, to this day, he never used and never saw the point of) on his way to his walk-in wardrobe on the other side. He dressed himself in a crisp navy-blue business suit with a matching tie, and a quick shift of his hair had it styled in his preferred manner. Staring at his reflection, he could admit that, at least on the outside, he looked normal.

Despite needing his gear, Daniel decided his situation deserved a mouthful or two of beer before he headed out (another thing a shifter didn’t have to worry about was their beer going flat if it was left half-finished in the fridge. Re-carbonation was easy enough for shifters). He left his bedroom with every intention of entering the kitchen when he realised someone else was in his apartment, and he dropped his hand into a fistful of lethal claws. He was so done with unwelcome visitors…

Angus was standing in the centre of his living room, casually observing all the boards that Daniel had been working on. “Put your claws away,” he said without turning to look at him.

Daniel was tempted not to out of sheer spite, but his torso throbbed from Angus’ last *lesson,* and he wasn’t stupid enough to take on the war commander a second time, especially when there wasn’t a scratch on *him.*

“I want you to leave,” Daniel growled, heading for his fridge. He removed a single beer and cracked the lid, refusing to offer his former guardian one because … *fuck him.*

When he turned to face Angus, the war commander held Daniel’s missing belongings in his enlarged left hand. “Still not your enemy,” he said, as Daniel extended his free arm out the twenty-five feet that separated them to reclaim his things without taking a single step towards his former mentor. Angus held onto them for a few seconds to emphasise that it was his choice to release them. “The last thing you need is the juxtaposition of your work and your divinity vying for domination amongst the mortals. Your missing kidney will serve as a continual reminder of what’s at stake whenever your divinity wants to start pissing all over the mortals under your command. If it’s any consolation, your brother required a similar wake-up call a few decades ago when he blurred the same line during the Gulf War.”

Daniel knew which brother he was referring to. He had five in total, including one half-brother, but the youngest was four, the next youngest was out in the world being ‘one with the animals’, and the twins were too busy getting into mischief to claim anyone. Only one of his brothers had ties to the military, and he wore the colonel’s eagle on the shoulders of his US Air Force uniform.  

Truthfully, Daniel had never really thought about how hard Ethan’s job would be during war times. His brother had still been too young to join the military during the Second World War, but he’d signed up soon after and been with them ever since. Plenty of wars had come and gone since then, and people always paid the ultimate price in combat, but how much harder would it be to lose people who mattered, knowing you could stop it if you lifted your game and took control of the whole damned universe?

Then, as was Daniel’s way, he put *himself* in that position, picturing how he would react if his MCS unit had managed to surround the ‘bad guys’ tomorrow and the assholes came out shooting. Would he be able to keep things relatively ‘human’ if any of his people were mortally wounded right in front of him, or would he go antichrist on their asses?

As the latter seemed most likely, Daniel suddenly had a whole new level of respect for his only big brother. After nearly seventy years in the Air Force, no one knew more about flying or being in that military branch than Ethan did. If he left them, he’d be taking all that knowledge and experience with him, and the Air Force would be all the poorer for it.

*Still, to stay active all this time, taking orders from those farther up the chain and not breaking when the enemy endangered his people?*

That had to be the biggest mind fuck of them all.

Transferring his belongings to his left hand, Daniel rested his right hand over the spot where the gauze covered the front of his wound. “Does it get any easier?” he asked, staring hard at his former guardian and losing much of his ire in the process.

Angus’ lips twitched, indicating Daniel had finally asked the right question. “Only when you stop caring, but that is a loss within itself.”

The words struck a chord, and Daniel broke eye contact, using the motion to watch his fingers unbutton his jacket and shrug that shoulder out of it. He then transferred everything to his other hand and removed the jacket, draping it over the island bench between them. After decades, he was a pro at putting everything where it needed to be, including his badge on his belt, his wallet and phone in their respective pockets and his shoulder holster under his left arm. His sunglasses were still on his desk at work.

“You know,” Angus said, finally facing him fully. His thumb gestured to the boards and the TV screens. “What you’ve got going on here is like *this close* to breaking the rules.” He held his thumb and forefinger up, practically touching.

“If luck was in the right place, the steps afterwards could be undertaken to achieve this same objective by anyone,” Daniel argued, shrugging his jacket back into place and buttoning it again.

“I didn’t say it *broke* the rules, lad, but figuring out where all the right steps are so that your people can go full steam ahead while touching all the necessary touchstones to make the chain of evidence secure is being very … *interpretational* with the no divine interference rule, wouldn’t you agree.”

“Are you going to rat me out, old man?”

“I’ll make a deal with you,” he said instead. Daniel arched an eyebrow without responding. “Make peace with Lucas and his partner, and all of this will become *very* cloudy in my memory.”

Given Angus had just pointed out that he hadn’t *technically* broken the rules, Daniel was within his rights to tell him where to stuff his supposed deal, but he knew there was more to this than first appearances. It was a friendly way of smoothing the ground going forward for all of them without anyone having a figurative gun to their head. A true gryps way of saying ‘please’ when he didn’t need to. The leadership style wasn’t one Daniel had ever seen from his old guardian before now, and he realised why. “Mated life looks good on you, old friend,” he approved.

Angus merely smirked in agreement.

***Tuesday***

After Mateo and his tribe moved on, Gerry and I returned to our little group of minions. Tyler and Tatum were both shaking their heads at us and as identical twins, they looked like bobbleheads on a bumped stand. “What?” I finally asked.

“Are you kidding?” Tyler asked. I was beginning to wonder if Tatum could speak at all. “You just totally owned that conversation with *the student body president,* man.”

I frowned. “What are you talking about? He was just inviting Gerry and me to a party this weekend … an event the whole graduating class was invited to.”

“Yeah, but … man, have you ever seen that old cartoon with the big butch dog stomping down the street and the little yapper running around his feet trying to impress him?”

Only because of my time with the guys did I know what he was talking about. Spreading my hand across his face, I gave him a light shove, pushing him back two steps. “Get away from me,” I grumbled.

“He’s right, though,” Shelly agreed, which surprised me. “I know who he is, too. That’s Mateo Lopez, and he, in front of his whole entourage, was bending over backwards trying to gain your favour. And you were acting like it meant nothing.”

“Because it *was* nothing,” I insisted, starting to get annoyed. “He’s just a guy like anyone else, and I only gave him the time of day because he’s a decent person. Not because of the position he holds.” I drew Geraldine closer and kissed her hair. “I didn’t know you liked horses, though, Angel. Do you have one in a stable somewhere? Or is there somewhere close that you like to go riding?”

Her face fell, and I knew I wouldn't like what came next. “I haven’t ridden in years, but I used to before I reached puberty.”

“Why would that stop you?” asked Shelly, the third person in our group who was originally from interstate. Unlike Jasmine, who came from a coastal background same as me, Shelly came from the Lone Star State, where a background in ranching was practically mandatory.

“My mother believed it would bow my legs and push the fat harder into my hips and fat ass.”

You could’ve heard a pin drop after that, and all too quickly, my girl realised what she said in a moment when her defences were down. My dark growl might not have helped.

“I mean…” she quickly tried to say, but I kissed her temple and gently shushed her.

I refused to listen to her justification of her mother’s horrendous behaviour. For my part, I was torn. Part of me wanted to celebrate the fact that she was finally so at ease with me that she could say whatever she wanted to say without fear of repercussions. The other part wanted to hunt her mother down and kill her slowly, and I couldn’t honestly say I was joking about that.

I looked across at Shelly. “When you have a minute, could you do me a favour and find out what it takes to buy a horse and look after it around here? All of its upkeep will need to be included, as I don't know a damn thing about horses. Distance isn’t really an issue, but Mateo just said his grandfather keeps horses in the Hamptons, and I know the police have horses, so to some degree, they can be kept in the city.”

“Sam! No! You can’t just buy me a horse…”

I twisted around to stand before her, putting my back to our group. My hands framed her cheeks so she couldn’t look anywhere but at me. “Baby, your mother stole so much from you, and if it’s the last thing I do, I *will* give back everything she took and more. She said all that crap to make you self-conscious, so if it's what you want to do, you will ride until you realise your weight has no bearing in the matter.”

Geraldine swallowed, her eyes glistening in unshed tears. “Will you ride with me?”

*Oh, hell.* I clearly hadn’t thought this through. Then again, maybe laughing at me as I make a complete turkey of myself falling off will keep her distracted from her mother’s hateful words. “If that’s what you want, Angel.”

Luckily for me, I had divine healing because I had the distinct impression I'd be needing it.

\* \* \*

 Nuncio was over Puerto Rico. Like eternally over it. Short of a family emergency (and by that, he meant a life or death level catastrophe), he’d come even if it were the triplets, especially after they turned up yesterday and reduced his sentence (just not before getting plenty of footage of whatever mess they’d gotten themselves into to entertain the masses later).

But other than that, he'd cease to be worshipped and die of old age before he ever willingly set foot in the place again. The forced separation from his son was killing him, and he honestly didn’t know how people in prison didn’t go mad. He was only holding it in because the island probably wouldn’t survive what this world called ‘an Antichrist’ going on the warpath.

That fucked-up designation was whacked, and he laughed his ass off every time he heard it … *usually.* He was descended from the Supreme Demon of Hell on both sides of his family (which was one of the many reasons why the Highborn Hellions loathed him), but they couldn’t refute the powerset he inherited from them.

His son Vadim had been brought to him last night at the apartment thanks to Aunt Col, who vouched for the hatchling’s safety and containment to the pryde. He had been just as ecstatic to see Vadim as Vadim was to see him, and the two had teetered between play-wrestling and simply hugging in every room of the apartment. After just two short hours, he’d needed to lean into his aunt’s emotional control as Vadim was once again taken from him. Then, after they were gone, he fell to his knees and howled his misery to the world at large.

The triplets were true to their word yesterday morning, scheduling everything down to the last detail, from personnel to equipment to organising three eight-hour shifts that ran around the clock.

Contracts had been drawn up with the new scheduling, adding the necessity of everyone wearing a clearly labelled uniform indicating who they worked for so that they could all be identified with the specific projects they were connected to. The triplets even took care of what was ordered by whom and when stating which suppliers could fill what orders on such short notice. When it looked like lumber would be a problem, Enoch, the triplet that specialised in timber, reached out to his contacts.

That part thrilled Nuncio, as the triplets knew about his mother’s decree for sourcing local materials. Mainly because he was no longer doing the sourcing, which was a technicality he would hide behind as long as necessary.

He’d been surprised by how long the triplets had stayed to help him out. Ever since he was a baby, they'd locked (well, in their case, proverbial) horns, and he’d expected them to get the ball rolling and leave. Bare minimum. Instead, they stayed for nearly three hours, ensuring everything was moving precisely how they wanted it to.

A few companies *really* disliked the Big Brother oversight, and one in particular tested Nuncio’s resolve by ‘accidentally’ flinging wet cement at the camera. The triplets had backed Nuncio’s play (not that he needed them to, but family support when facing external parties was a guarantee with Mystallians) after it was announced that the penalty would be applied for the day, the company threw a snit-fit and walked off the job.

That didn't bother the triplets in the least. With their innates in building, they’d already factored that company’s departure into their preparations and smoothly spread the workload to the others, who greedily lapped up the lucrative jobs.

The following two companies that messed with the cameras took the penalty on the chin for one day, but Nuncio noticed the individuals responsible for the loss weren’t back on site today.

Today had been a new day, and Nuncio made a point of walking the job site, probably making a pain in the ass of himself in the process, not that anyone was about to complain. Big boss and all of that.

Because of the veil (and him making himself invulnerable to things like dropping bricks from above by turning his skeleton into Mystallian steel, knowing everything else would be survivable long enough to shift around), no one gave him any crap about wearing flip-flops with no hardhat on the site. Honestly, if they tried, he would kill someone and use the top half of their skull for a hard hat before he’d wear one of those ugly-assed things. Not even the triplets had to do that, and this building shit was their specialty.

His hip pocket played *‘Bitch Is Goin’ Down’,* and grinning, he retrieved his phone and opened the app that revealed the contents of his brand spanking new share portfolio. Eighty billion dollars had changed hands in the transaction, but it had been approved overnight, and as of ten seconds ago, the shares were transferred to his name. He’d rejigged the app to play the appropriate song instead of the regular boring ‘beep’ of a completed transaction.

That was step one.

Regardless of how the case against Helen Portsmith shook out, a Nascerdios had legally made the purchase, making it Nascerdios property, where the family’s ownership rules trumped mortal law. There were definitely no ‘takesie-backsies’ in their universe, which means the law couldn't commandeer it as stolen property.

Likewise, no one could touch it if Nuncio decided to ‘gift’ it to someone else either. There would be no extra taxes. No explanations needed. No deep dive into whoever he decided to forward it on to. A Nascerdios could give anything to anyone; that was all there was to it.

The only rule he’d nudged was his Aunt Col’s desire to keep the divine out of the billion-dollar businesses of the mortals. It was too easy for them to pour endless amounts of money into a company they preferred to the detriment of all others. Personally, Nuncio didn’t see the problem. Mortals did that all the time amongst themselves, but it wasn’t his realm and the whole ‘monkeys and circuses’ thing came into effect.

In this case, he didn’t think it would be a problem. If anything, he was being a demonic guardian angel, and Aunt Col usually sided with that.

Whistling a happy tune to himself, he opened the back door to the government app. Step Two of his plan involved adding Geraldine Portsmith’s name and personal details as a suitable shareholding candidate for her father’s company, using the back door to expedite her purchasing approval the way he had done his own.

After all, it was only fitting that the shares went home.

 As one of the first teams to be based there it was quite a shithole. We made our home inside an abandoned hangar that had not been used or occupied in a very long time, camel spiders out numbered us by quite alot. Pallets of MREs were dropped off every week or so, mail, care packages etc. The C130s out of Riyadh were busy. 
Every once in awhile there was this putrid smell of death and decay that never went away until the wind changed. Every couple weeks we switched into civies and mounted a 1990 Mercury station wagon and would head to Dubai to meet some Navy folks who brought O2 tanks and some other goodies for us to do our missions. 
We would jump into our white station wagon with fake wood grain trim and head back to Al Dhafra. 
Why civies? Well, when we got to Dubai some clown in a suit and a nice young lady in a skirt came on board and gave us the do's and dont's of UAE. See since this was still around the time the USSR crumbled the newly formed Russian gov knew we were there and wanted to know all about what we were up to. So civies would make us incognito...yeah ok...ha.
Our first time to Dubai a guy wearing shorts and a wife beater just out of the blue says ""hey dudes, whats the U.S. military doin here?"" Yeah real incognito. We still stuck out in this place. We just ignored him and went on with our business. 
So anyways, getting to leave the base to go to Dubai we found what that awful smell was. I dont know about today but back then the base was surrounded by sheep and goat farms and on the side of the roads there were these type of roll off dumpsters. They were heaping full of dead rotting animals. They were every where. You wouldnt think there could be that many dead and still have enough left alive to keep a farm going. We did have a shower in the hangar which was nice and our Lt. discovered a local who would boil our clothes which ive never seen BDUs get so crisp and clean without starch!
 14 hrs on 10 hrs off 6 days a week. On our off day we would go to the souk and get ripped off lol. 
We did have a slight friendly fire incident when the IDEX kicked off and nobody bothered to inform us munitions would be getting detonated. That was exciting. Security Forces seemed to wreck a Humvee once a month rolling it down a sand dune. 
I guess you had to be there then to appreciate it today. I also think there were some donts added to that list after we rotated out for the first time. We were definately the ugly americans until the rules were written."

What’s your opinion on eating non veg food in train? I don’t travel via train so I hardly know what’s the norm or acceptable thing to do.

I personally won’t prefer to eat non veg food due to below reasons:
1. It’s better to eat light food while travelling 
2. It’s easy to confuse meat with beef 
3. Non Veg food usually have strong flavour and smell and eating in enclosed space might be troublesome for other passengers 

PS: I’m maithil and mostly non vegetarian

***Tuesday*** 

“Look, Grandfather’s throwing me a huge graduation party this Saturday night at our place in the Hamptons,” Mateo Lopez said as soon as I returned to reality. “I don’t know if you know this or not, but my family has an estate up there, and as I said, everyone who’s graduating this year is invited. You don’t need to R.S.V.P. if you don’t want to, but if you have any food or drink preferences that you’d like to see there, let me know. We have a great cook who’s part magician, and she’s been looking forward to this as much as I have.”

Oooohhh, it was killing me not to voice the cocky snark that came so readily to mind. As it was, I had to swallow twice in an effort to scrub the words *‘my money’s on Robbie’* from the tip of my tongue.

“What if I grab your phone number and shoot you the details?”

“What if you just tell them to me?” I countered, not particularly wanting him to have my number. I might only be a Wilcott now, but in twelve months, the world would probably know I was a Nascerdios, and I didn’t want to go through the hassle of getting a new phone number because people suddenly wanted me for things. Besides, my memory was better than any computerised text.

He seemed a little disappointed by my reluctance but recovered quickly enough, rattling off the address that meant absolutely nothing to me. Evidently, Gerry recognised it if the little shiver of excitement she gave was anything to go by.

According to Mateo, we could turn up any time after lunch, and the celebrations would last until the following day, which meant calling it a ‘party’ was a wild understatement.

“Will you come?” he asked.

I liked that he asked rather than assumed I would go simply because he wanted it. Dad’s family could learn a lot from this guy. “We haven’t got any plans yet,” I admitted, “But I’ll have to check with my family.” More truthfully, I didn’t want to commit to anything until I’d thought about it (though, knowing my family and friends – they probably had something planned for our formal graduation). Parties weren’t my scene, but I knew Gerry wanted to go. I could practically feel her vibrating beside me.

“Well, what if I give you my number? That way, if you need help finding the place or anything else, you have a way of reaching me.”

“Sure.”

He seemed to be waiting for something, but I wasn’t sure what.

“Are you going to tell me what it is, or am I supposed to guess?” I asked irritably when the wait stretched out too long.

“Sam has a photographic memory,” Gerry said, lifting her head from my shoulder. “He doesn’t need to type it into his phone to remember it.”

Mateo eyed me, and this time my smug smirk couldn’t be held back. I even added a slight shrug and head tilt for good measure. He then quickly told me the number and waited, no doubt for me to be unable to repeat it back to him.

I honestly thought about just walking away at that point. It wasn’t like I owed him anything, and I certainly wasn’t a trained animal to perform for his entertainment, but Geraldine gave me a subtle squeeze, and I knew she *really* wanted this.

So I internalised and replayed the number until I knew it by heart. Then, just to be a bit of a dick, I memorised exactly *the way* he said it so that when I returned to reality, I shot it back at him with all the same gaps and vocal fluctuations.

“Holy shit!” one of the other guys swore once I had. “Were you a fuckin’ parrot in a former life, Wilcott?”

“That is pretty cool,” Mateo agreed, beaming happily at me.

I shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal. “Everyone in my dad’s family can do it,” I said, without a hint of a lie.

“I heard you got Gillespie fired,” Adrian Saxon said. Mateo and Adrian were joined at the hip: where one went, the other was at least within shouting distance. Adrian was slightly larger than Mateo, but that was really all I knew about him.

“He got himself fired,” Geraldine volleyed, lifting her head off my shoulder, clearly not happy with the insinuation that I was somehow responsible. “He abused his position and attacked Sam numerous times. He even had Sam searched before an exam in front of the entire assembly like a common criminal!”

“I didn’t hear about that,” Mateo said with a sharp edge to his voice, his attention jerking back to me for confirmation. “Seriously?”

I could understand his annoyance. Mateo was very passionate about his role as head of the student board, and if things hadn’t turned out the way they had with Gillespie, Mateo would’ve been well within his rights to file a formal complaint and *still* have Gillespie fired.

Then it occurred to me that he could’ve also been annoyed that I hadn’t brought it to him. It was ludicrous, given we’d barely said a handful of words in all the years we’d been at school together, and I hardly needed him to fight my battles for me. It was nice that he gave a damn, though, so I kept my answer civil. “It bothered Gerry more than me,” I admitted. “I’ve been patted down plenty of times over the years…”

“How come?” Bailey Gibson asked from behind Adrian; not in a douchie way but general curiosity. I was intimately familiar with the former.

“Greenpeace warriors aren’t popular in many parts of the world. Trying to do what’s in the best interest of the ocean isn’t necessarily what’s in the corporate inter—”

“Sam’s family is hugely into ocean conservation,” Geraldine slid in, cutting off my usual spiel on the matter. “His mother is on the Greenpeace frontlines more often than not, and that’s how his parents met.”

“Have you ever gone toe to toe with another boat?” another guy asked. One of the names I was never told.

“Lots of times,” I admitted wearily. “Been fired at with high-powered water cannons and even got hit once, too. Dad didn’t take kindly to that and returned the favour.”

With the veil now lifted, I remembered that Mediterranean Sea incident with all my memories intact. *Freak wave that capsized that fishing vessel, my backside.* Dad had been hidden amongst the crew, and when I’d nearly been knocked overboard, he saved me and then went on the warpath. That fleet was lucky he was still ducking and weaving around Mom at the time, or it would’ve been a full-blown tsunami that took out the whole fleet instead of just the vessel that hit me.

“Were you hurt?” Mateo asked, growing angry on my behalf.

I shook my head, but now that I was thinking about it, I should’ve realised something weird was happening that day. I was hit square in the chest by a water cannon and driven across the deck after bouncing off every pole, wall and railing before Dad diverted most of the blast away from me. For days, if not weeks after that, I should’ve been a walking bruise, yet by nightfall I was fine. I couldn’t even pretend to blame the veil for that one either. I was a Wilcott, and no one invoked the phrase within my hearing. The ignorance on the matter was all mine.

“Not enough to do any permanent damage,” I said, remembering how banged up I’d been right after the incident.

“The closest I ever came to something like that was getting thrown off my horse when a bee stung it,” Mateo admitted. “Your war stories are way cooler than mine.”

“I guess that’s why you never really had much time for us, huh?” Adrian asked.

I squinted at him. “Excuse me?”

“Adrian’s right,” that other nameless guy said. “You kept your head down and avoided everyone for the longest time. I always said it was because you were shy, but that’s not it at all, is it? You had an agenda and nothing, and no one was allowed to get in your way.”

“Now, hold on,” I growled, for I had never in my life ignored anyone … at least not intentionally.

“Stop,” Mateo called, just as Parker came rushing back with the cold can of Coke in his hand. The drink was quickly passed to Mateo, who opened it and took a sip before attempting to pass it to me. “It doesn’t matter what happened back then. The past is in the past. We’re talking *now.* That’s the main thing.”

I eyed the drink for a second, then took it and swallowed deeply before offering it to Gerry, who sipped it before passing it back to Mateo. Even though it was still before school, between the summer sun, the reflection of the East River on one side of us and Long Island Sound on the other meant the school grounds grew hotter faster than anywhere else in the city. So, as far as peace offerings went, a chilled Coke wasn’t a bad one.

As a point of note, *water* would’ve been better.

“I’d really like it if you came to the party,” Mateo said, taking another sip before passing it to Adrian to finish.

“We’ll just have to wait and see. Mom and Dad have their hands full at the moment, but other family members have started to crawl out of the woodwork.” *Yes, Uncle Barris, I’m talking specifically about you.*

“Well, even if you could make it for a couple of hours, that’d be good.” He looked away from me to Geraldine. “Grandfather has some beautiful Arabian thoroughbreds if you like to ride.”

“I do,” Geraldine admitted, surprising me. She’d never mentioned horses before.

I nuzzled her hair. “Keeping secrets from me, Angel?” I whispered against the helix of her ear so as not to embarrass her in front of Mateo and his entourage. I wasn’t angry about it; more hurt, if anything, for it left me wondering what else she really liked to do but hadn’t told me. Plus, I was still stewing over Boyd and Lucas’ swipes on Sunday, and a very small part of me worried that her secrecy was fear-driven.

But then she looked at me and smiled like I owned the world, making me grin, too.

“Never,” she promised, giving me a light peck on my lips. “It just hadn’t come up before now.”

Mateo watched us with a smile.

I need min 70C, ideally 90C chamber temp.

X1C can handle up to 50C, over that it becomes unstable and 50C is not enough for non filled materials. If you want to print larger pieces in PA (not PA-CF, PA-GF... just pure PA) or even ABS 50C will just not cut it and CF/GF is too expensive.

I did not follow up what was coming out past few years so if someone can shoot something from the top of their head I'll appreciate it, especially if there is some personal experience.

300x300x300mm or more would be ideal but 250x250x200 will do. IDEX would also be a good idea to use break-away / soluble support

So far I'm looking at QIDI+4 seems they invested a lot in marketing it is popping out on YT non stop but it is 65C only and I hear they had some safety issues... price is right and build volume is adequate but I'm checking if there's something better out there, I'm suspicious as YT started offering me Q

***Tuesday*** 

By the time Kulon rolled up to the SUNY drop-off, I saw our little gaggle of newbies lingering in the lawned area, waiting for us. One of them must have noticed our arrival, for they all turned towards us by the time we stopped.

As much as it still bugged me, I waited for Kulon to climb out and go around the front of the car to open my door for me because it was what *he* wanted, and at that moment, it wasn’t important enough for me to fight him on it. Not anymore.

I slid out of the seat and straightened up alongside my night-time bodyguard. My eyes met his (no doubt he could see my eyes behind my reflective aviators), and I smiled at him without saying what we both already knew: that I appreciated him and wanted to say thank you. He smirked at me and dipped his head in return. I then turned and reached back into the car to help Geraldine out while Kulon held the door.

Since we had no classes or exams, I had Gerry’s lunch and mine in my backpack, which Gerry stepped out of the car with because I'd forgotten it. I kissed her cheek in gratitude (because it would have sucked to have realm-stepped back to Mason’s vet clinic to grab it from the car later), at the same time relieving her of the bag to sling it up onto my shoulder. Gerry snaked her now free hand around my waist and rested her head on my shoulder as I draped my free arm across her shoulders.

We left Kulon to close the door and headed over to our tribe.

I didn’t even get the chance to greet our students before I heard my name being called. And by ‘called’, I meant shouted at a decibel level that challenged the klaxon. I turned to see a dozen or so of my year-mates (only a few of them were in classes with me, but we were all graduating this year) with their posse of students trailing behind them. Gerry tensed in my arms, and I instinctively went into my memory for what I knew about these guys.

I remember Dad telling me how dangerous it was to try and recreate a memory in my imagination. That it was difficult to differentiate the original from the recreation at a later date when they both looked real, but one could become anything I wanted. But Dad and his people weren’t human from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and I believed I had a workaround.

It’s called a *search engine.*

Heading into my imagination, I created my bed, complete with pillows and the retractable TV built into its base. Making myself comfortable with pillows at my back against the bedhead and my bare feet facing the rising TV (even in my imagination, Mom would murder me if she caught me on the bed with shoes on), I told my imagination to cue up a movie of all the interactions I’d ever had with these people.

My solution was pure genius. The memory was now framed by a TV with my feet in clear view, making it easily discernible from the original memories.

And the best part? I didn’t have to waste three years searching through every stupid memory. Like a computer, my memory was stored in a separate database, and my *request* was being typed into the search engine. The resulting *movie* was an edited collection of every incident stored in my mental database. *Ta-daa!* 

The few minutes here and there that I’d spent in these people’s company over three years amounted to maybe an hour of solid footage to roll through. Tops.

Five minutes into the movie, I created a bucket of buttered popcorn and a large soda to give my hands something to do. It was so tempting to create an image of Gerry to snuggle up to, but I was determined to only have the real thing or nothing at all.

At the end of the ‘rerun’, I had several of their names and how (especially in the last two years) they’d treated me like I was invisible. That wasn’t actually a problem for me since I’d wanted to be invisible so I could focus on my studies. I couldn’t count the number of times people had come to the library only to be interrupted by friends and dragged away for whatever reason.

The girls that had gone after Geraldine were another matter entirely, and if I had my way, they’d be following those guys that Dad had dealt with under the bridge into the far reaches of the Atlantic. Ironically, for precisely the same reason.

Once the movie ended, I left my imagination and rejoined reality. Yes, I knew Dad’s people called it ‘the physical realm’, but I couldn’t bring myself to say that. Reality was the real world in real-time. Everything else was either the past or fake.

“Lopez,” I said with a curious frown, for if the girls had a *queen bee,* Mateo Lopez was our school’s *lion king.* Apart from being the most popular guy on campus, he was also the student board president. He had an olive complexion and bright green eyes, and his dark hair was styled with gel (I knew that now because of Gerry. The guys sometimes used gel, too, but I never really paid any attention to it). His swimmer’s build gave him the graceful movement of a panther.

The guys at his back were a blend of different body types, with a couple of future mafia leg breakers amongst them. They looked out for him, much like Kulon and his brothers looked out for me, so again, I couldn’t hold the intimidation factor against them. People just knew to get out of their way.

That’s not to say Mateo was like ‘the rich bad guy’ you read about in books. Far from it. Yes, he genuinely had it all, and yes, he was okay with it, but my internal review had shown me a couple of times where one of his people had pushed someone else out of his way, and he’d landed on the bully with both feet and forced them to go and apologise.

Right now, he was smiling at me, revealing a mouthful of teeth that … actually, I probably *could* afford now. “You’re a hard man to catch, Wilcott,” he said, coming to a halt before me. The inch or so in height between us meant I only had to lift my eyes a little to meet his.

Without knowing where this was going, I shrugged nonchalantly. “Places to be, people to see,” I said, paraphrasing Angelo back when he was partying and didn’t want to give us specifics.

“Well, I’m hoping my place will be one of those places to be.”

Geraldine drew in a short breath, and my glance found her eyes had widened with a slight sparkle. I wouldn’t call her out on what brought that on while we had an audience, but I would find out as soon as we had a moment alone.

“You and your girl,” Lopez went on, smiling at Geraldine while gesturing at her with a loose hand. “Uhhh … Justine, wasn’t it?”

“Geraldine,” Gerry corrected, shyly tilting her head into my shoulder. It was probably the first time she hadn’t mentioned her last name or hidden behind her father’s company name. I considered that progress.

His fingers snapped in the classic ‘of course’ motion. “Right. *Geraldine.”* Then he paused and squinted. “Geraldine or Gerry?”

Okay, I was liking him more. “Gerry,” I answered for her.

Mateo’s eyebrow arched momentarily, but he didn’t comment. “Well, I’m hosting a huge graduation party this weekend at my place. Everybody’s coming, and there’s plenty of room. Do you ride horses?”

I huffed, because really? *Horses?* Did I look like I could ride a horse? “My life has always been on or near the water. I was born on a beach and New York City is about as far inland as I’ve ever settled.”

“Do you know what one looks like?” someone behind Mateo sneered.

Mateo whirled, but not before I saw the anger in his eyes. “Parker, go and grab me a cold Coke from the canteen,” he ordered.

The named guy blanched. “But the vending machine’s clos—”

“I *said* the cafeteria. Maybe on the way back, you can find where you dropped your manners.” He continued to glare until the guy turned and took off.

“You didn’t have to do that,” I said when his attention returned to me. “I’m not ashamed of where I came from.”

“Nor should you be, but that was uncalled for. Actually, I’ve been asking around about you, Wilcott. Is it true your grandfather raised you because your mother worked away a lot?”

My gaze narrowed. *Now,* he was heading into dangerous territory.

Seeing my annoyance, he held up a hand to ward off my irritation. “No, nothing bad, I swear. I just meant if it’s true, you and I have that in common. I’ve lived with my grandfather my whole life since my parents spend most of their time overseas on business. I hardly see them either.”

*Wait … is he trying to bond with me? Is that what this is?*

Mom would have a fit if she saw me socialising with a Corporate brat.

But then, didn’t that make me just as bad as the guy Mateo sent away? The petty name-calling and snide comments based on his background, if only in my head? I didn’t like that at all and internalised for a few minutes to thoroughly chastise myself in an imaginary mirror.

Because clearly, Parker wasn’t the only one who needed an attitude adjustment.

***Tuesday*** 

Mason waved as Kulon pulled out into traffic with Sam and Gerry to take them to school. Not that he would call it ‘school’ anymore since it was only meat week, and in his mind, that made his roommates unpaid babysitters, but he would probably bite the bullet next year and walk the newbies through their future, too.

Probably.

Possibly.

Maybe.

It wasn’t just the whole getting paid as a qualified vet for the first time in his life (though it’ll be nice to see a four-digit weekly pay packet when it happens); it was the whole … preparing the future vets vs saving animals that were in trouble today, and personally, he was leaning towards the latter.

Medical staff everywhere would understand.

Realising he was trying to justify a decision he’d already subconsciously made (and failing miserably), Mason went through the door that Sonya was already opening for him. “Now that’s what I call service,” he grinned as she shut and locked the door behind him since they weren’t officially open yet.

Sonya screwed her face up in a pretend sneer and shook her head. “I was letting Ben in, and you just happened to sneak in with him,” she countered, then beamed happily at the rottweiler, who looked back at her with his tongue hanging out.

Mason’s face struggled to remain indignant. “In that case, bite me, woman,” he snicker-snorted.

“There is to be no biting on the premises today,” Khai said with absolute authority, striding out of Consult One.

Mason thought he was serious for a second until he saw the twinkle in the true gryps’ eyes and decided to run with it. “And how do you plan on enforcing that, bossman? It’s illegal to withhold paychecks on a whim these days.”

Khai didn’t even have to think about it. “I believe I still have a scold’s bridle or two from the old days…”

Sonya frowned, but Mason threw his head back and laughed like it was the funniest thing he’d heard all day … because it really, really was. Khai’s mate was a centuries-old, pregnant border warrior. There couldn’t be a more dangerous female in all of existence!

“Dude, I can’t even!” he huffed when breathing finally returned to him almost a full minute later. Knowing the grip would slide down his forearm, he dropped Ben's lead and raised one finger. “A: Mega illegal, dude.” Second finger. “B: There’s not a chance in hell that Lady Col would let you have any of that stuff anywhere near the Prydelands, and C…” Third finger. “Holy crap! I triple-dare you to have even one of those things anywhere near your wife right now, and I’m begging you to film it for me if you do! She’ll butcher you in a heartbeat and feed what’s left of you to your kids!”

Horror was written all over Sonya’s face as she looked from one to the other, searching for any hint that what he’d said was a joke. At Khai’s frown, Mason realised he had overshared … again. Still, it was an easy fix without drawing on the damn phrase. “He doesn’t mean to actually use them. Those things are valuable antiques, even if their history is as creepy as hell. But what makes it so funny is Khai’s wife's a battle-hardened soldier who’s home on maternity leave, and the bossman wants us to believe she’d let him have multiple Scold’s Bridles in her home.” Mason turned to Khai. “You’d be the one wearing them if she found them.”

“I keep forgetting your wife’s pregnant,” Sonya gushed. “When are you going to bring her by so we can meet her? We’d love that.”

No, I don’t think you would, Mason thought to himself, remembering what true gryps looked like in their natural form and picturing a short-tempered pregnant one trying not to eat the tasty humans.

Khai’s condemning look said plenty, and Mason swallowed hard, realising he’d moved away from one touchy subject only to bring up another. “Unfortunately, she’s pregnant with multiple babies,” the bossman said as Mason grimaced and mouthed ‘sorry’ at him. “Even now, we’re not sure if it’s five or six, but she needs to stay home where the family can safely monitor her.”

“Are multiple births common in your family?”

“Very. I was one of six, and Choi was one of four. It’s why our family always goes home to have our … children.”

“So the overnight stays are all checked, fed and ready for evalu…” Gavin rushed out as he hightailed it down the corridor from the treatment room at the other end, only to come to a skidding halt when everyone turned to look at him. “What?” he asked, looking from one to the next. “What’d I miss?”

“Just our taskmaster telling us to get back to work,” Mason said, hoping to smooth everything. “Hey, speaking of that, has there been any improvement on Nathan?” Nathan being the missing vet tech that Khai had tracked down as an unconscious ‘John Doe’ in Boston over the weekend.

Sonya’s face fell, and Mason almost regretted asking.

“Shoot. Sorry, Sonya. Damn, I wish he was. I’d love to know what he was doing there.” Man, I really can’t say anything right this morning.

She forced a stoic expression and said, “We’ll just have to wait until he wakes up to ask him.”

Mason looked at Khai, who shook his head ever so subtly. Clearly, he had done all he was willing to do for the human, but maybe there was room to negotiate that matter later in private. “Well, one of my roommates is a cop. Not a cop up in Boston, obviously, but if I ask him how we could go about poking our noses into his business, he’d be able to tell us what we can and can’t do legally.”

Sonya’s face brightened. “Would you? Oh, Mason, that would be awesome! I’ve had the biggest argument with my husband because I wanted to hire a private eye to find out what was going on, and he has other plans for that money involving an overseas vacation for us all once Allyssa recovers from her treatment.”

“You never told us about that!” Gavin whined. Despite knowing it was well-deserved and that there was absolutely nothing stopping her from going, the thought of losing her even briefly seemed to hurt him.

“It’s not for months, maybe even years. Allyssa has to be well enough to travel before we can even consider it, which is why I want to steal some of it now to help Nathan.”

Mason glanced at Khai, who turned his back on the discussion. “Back to work, people,” he said, heading back into Consult One.

Instead of heading down the corridor to the lunchroom-slash-store room, Mason followed him into Consult One, closing the door behind him. “Hey, Khai,” he said, keeping his voice down.

“No,” Khai answered firmly without turning to look at him.

Mason was immediately affronted. “How do you know what I’m going to say, if you don’t let me say it?”

At that, he did turn. “Because it’s obvious. Between the sudden use of my name instead of one of those ridiculous monickers you prefer and the last part of that conversation out there, you want me to cure Sonya’s daughter. But before you throw whatever convoluted argument you’ve got buzzing around in that skull of yours, ask yourself why Skylar hasn’t already done it. Sonya is her receptionist and has been for years, so there’s every chance my sister’s met and knows the daughter’s ailments very well.”

Okay, so he had pegged the question. Still … “Then why hasn’t she?”

“Because we’re not allowed.”

Mason’s mouth opened to argue, but Khai raised his hand.

“Stop,” he ordered forcefully, and Mason complied. “Think it through. We’re only allowed to do what the world at large is capable of when we’re out in the world. Humans are capable of great things, and we can get away with doing any of that all day long. But if Skylar were to cure the girl using knowledge that humans hadn't developed yet, she would be sent back to the Prydelands so fast it’d make her head spin, and then every living creature she might save after that would be without her help. Do you understand?”

There was so much to unpack in that. What Mason had been tossing around right before coming into the clinic about saving animals that day or looking to the future took on a whole other meaning when it was the true gryps choosing. All those files he’d been reading through … all those animals she’d saved … but the trade-off was to pretend to only be capable of the very best of what the rest of the world could do. Accrediting every victory to the skills another human somewhere had, and watching people and animals die because they couldn't meet that one important criterion…

“How do you stand it?” he asked, as the weight of that knowledge bore down on him, and he wasn’t even the one gifted to use it.

“Up until last week, I avoided humans.”

Which brought up something else altogether. “But you like working with us now, right?”

Khai looked over Mason’s head and sighed as if in pain. That or Mason was dancing on his last nerve. Probably a combination of the two. “I don’t…not like it,” he said cautiously.

Mason would take it. “You know, if you ever want to unwind with some of your own who feel the same way about us, you’re welcome to visit the apartment any time. I’m pretty sure Sam’s guys are all happy to be amongst the humans.”

“I appreciate that, but home is where I’ll be going in the evenings from now on. Choi wasn’t thrilled to learn of my worldly adventure over the weekend that involved a couple of instances of break and enter, and she’s assured me she is not raising our young alone just because I might be caught next time.”

“You were never in any danger of being—!”

Khai chuckled like Mason was an idiot. “Mason, you’re young. You’re single. You may be very worldly in terms of how the human race operates as a whole, but trust me, when your pregnant mate says you’re done … you’re very done.”

Mason tilted his head to one side. “Any chance of getting a hall pass if you promise not to do anything the humans consider illegal? I mean, Lucas is a cop, so it’s not like any of us are gonna break the law.”

Khai smirked. “You don’t quit, do you?”

“Have you met me?”

“I’ll see what she says.”

“Use ‘pretty please with a cherry on top’ and tell her your friends really, really want you to come over and that…”

“That makes me sound like a hatchling.”

“Hey, if it works…”

That pained look returned. “Don’t you have patients to attend to?”

“Fine,” Mason groused; or at least, he pretended to. This free banter between him and Khai was both new and fun. He turned and headed for the door, though he held one finger above his shoulder for Khai to see. “To be tabled for another time.”

“May twenty-two-sixteen works for me.”

Two centuries into the future—and at least one after I’ll be dead. With his hand on the door handle, Mason shot his boss a faux-disgusted scowl over his shoulder, fighting the childish urge to poke his tongue at him and cross his eyes for good measure.

To see Khai standing with his arms folded and his head tilted to one side, his eyebrow arching despite his lips pinching together hard to ward off the smile that Mason could see so desperately wanted to come through; Mason wanted to dance in the hall in victory.

Khai was no longer an iceman.

He was thawing.

To be quite honest, instructions were very manageable up until the electronics part. Just follow the instructions and check comments. However on the electronics part, the comments were for previous batches where the electronics configuration (i.e where things plugged in) were different. This was super confusing, and additionally some pics didnt really line up.

Take your time building and make sure things are *tight*. Buy a proper allen key set with half sizes as well. No ball-tip keys. Slow building and following step by step gave me (at least reported by RatOs) a perfect z offset between the nozzles and excellent performance for beacon calibration. As well as very low frame warp. Still need to check skew however lol 

Add foam underneath the baseplates, they will rattle.

Make sure bearings are in the correct orientation, and always check how free they spin after tightening down the bolts.

HEAT INSERTS make sure they are slightly below flush, do not allow them to stick above the print! If you didnt have your soldering iron handy like me, a torx driver set (i think T15) holds the inserts quite well, and a large BIC bbq lighter will get you through the entire build barely.

Electronics section tips: Print out the final image of the complete wiring setup, these are correct. Have a notepad to write down what motors are called and where they plug in on the octopus. Additionally, a label maker on these would have saved SO much confusion. For any of the usb devices, feed them through the hole on the box before connection it as the holes are not big enough to fit the usb A part through.

BUY THE CORRECT CRIMPING TOOL AND CHECK ALL THE IMAGES FOR THE CORRECT PINOUT you only have one chance for the fan connectors. Either additionally buy the correct pin removal tools or buy a crimping tool that comes with spare connectors that may not be identical but will still work. I bought https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT5TP9PC?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share and it worked fantastically for all the crimps except the large ring and spade terminals, those i used a cheap crimp/strip tool.

Also, dont forget the weird USB jumper board to jump usb boards to the raspberry pi hat

The 120v/240v switch on the psu must be pushed ALL THE WAY or it wont turn on it at all. Took me an hour to figure out I didnt click it all the way over.

Print this [nut holder ](https://www.printables.com/model/1027664-ssr-nut-holder) to save you from pain and suffering trying to install the solid state relay in the enclosure

After having it built, make sure to update all packages. Google VAOC and Beacon initialising steps for the ratrig, they arent super clear in the main instruction set.

I still need to properly tension my belts, right now im sitting at 6000 accel for all axis but some reviewers are reporting 10k-18k accel reported by input shapers after using a proper belt tension tool. Have it on the way and will report back.

***Tuesday*** 

Barris appeared alongside the firepit that overlooked the San Fransisco Bay area. He’d realised halfway through his realm-step that he didn’t actually know where his oldest brother was at that moment, which was why he redirected his step to Llyr’s primary residence on the West Coast.

It was still the middle of the night over this side of the country, but that didn’t bother him any more than it would Llyr. He pulled out his phone and called the lying asshole, breathing through the rage he wanted to unleash.

The thirty seconds it took Llyr to pick up didn’t help his mood at all, and his brother’s savage *“What?!”* was just the icing on the cake.

“You gotta be shitting me, brother,” Barris shot back just as angrily. “You think *you’ve* got the right to be fuckin’ pissed right now?!”

Millions of years between them gave his older brother the heads up on just how angry Barris was. “Where are you?” he asked warily.

“Your firepit in San Fransisco, and if you’re not here in two seconds, I’m going to Sam’s place in New York to find out what else you’re hiding from me, you fucking prick.”

“Stay there,” Llyr ordered, and the phone disconnected.

Barris breathed heavily, counting out the seconds. He might have said he’d leave in two, but for the sake of family, he would stretch it to ten before following through on his threat.

Llyr made it in eight, wearing skin-tight swimming briefs that looked similar to the ones those body-building people posed in during competitions. He was still dripping wet with his phone in his hand and had clearly used the seconds to get clear of the water somewhere to realm-step.

“Where the fuck did you have your phone?” Barris asked, eyeing the utter lack of pockets…or even enough fabric to be a pocket. As one possibility came to him, he all but cringed behind a raised hand and added quickly, “Forget I asked that. I really don’t want to know.”

Llyr dropped the phone on the ochre outdoor lounge and stormed around the furniture to be within reaching distance of Barris. It was an instinctive move that in the past would have put Llyr in the dominant position between them mentally, and despite the presence of their rings blocking that ability, Barris scooted to the other end of the firepit to keep them apart out of habit.

“Why do two of Sam’s roommates have Plus One status?” he demanded, glaring angrily at his older brother. “How many fuckin’ kids have you got out there, old man?”

“Four, and you’ve met them all. Three more are on the way. I’ve told you this already.”

“Then how…?”

“It’s not because of me,” Llyr answered. “Or Sam. So dial back the attitude while you still can, little brother.”

Accepting Llyr would never lie to his face, Barris followed his *suggestion* and internalised a few minutes to calm down. When he returned, he was breathing normally. “Fine. If they’re not connected to you and yours, then who?” His calmer state of mind also gave him the latitude to poke at his brother’s skimpy attire. “And since when have you worn that style of swimwear?”

His lips twitched slightly as he asked, for Llyr had been one of the last to be dragged into modern times, clinging to the Mystallian ways like his existence depended on it. That included loose swimwear that covered everything from the hips to the knees. He’d also been one of the last of their generation to accept the swimming trunks as a compromise back when Columbine had first introduced them to Mystal as a teenager. She’d been determined to find a middle ground between the Mystallians’ refusal to be naked around each other outside marriage and the Yarusian way of communal bathing, which she found familially healing.

The indoor swimming pool, complete with swimming trunks, was finally approved when Uncle Chance sided with Columbine against her father and stayed for the first official indoor pool party.

So, as freeing as it was to skinny-dip (or, in this case, close enough to it), Llyr would *never* willingly partake in this of his own accord. “Who’d you lose a bet to?”

He was stunned to see Llyr’s dark scowl shift into a shy smirk. “Ivy likes what she sees.”

Barris’ jaw fell slack, and then he couldn’t help himself. “Well, lookit you, you preening slut,” he laughed, immediately ducking under the wild punch that Llyr swung at his head. He popped back up and scooted sideways, still laughing at his brother’s murderous glare. “Seriously, bro. If she’s into muscle-on-muscle, good for you. I even have plenty of body oil at the gyms…”

“I hate you right now.”

As much fun as it was to wind his brother up like a cheap clock, Barris had more important things to discuss. “Which brings us full circle, since you weren’t my favourite person when I first got here either. If Sam’s roommates have got nothing to do with you or him, who *are* they connected to?”

Llyr’s face fell. “Barris…”

Barris’ head shake was hard and adamant. “Nope. Fuck you. You had your chance to tell me in your time, and now you’re telling me in mine. Right here, right now. What the fuck is going on in your household, Llyr?”

“I told you, it’s all going to come out at the reun—”

“Tell me, damn it!”

“I want your word; you won’t say anything to anyone else in the family…”

“Fuck off. That’s not how our family operates.”

“You can’t do one without the other, Barris. If you tell anyone about Sam’s roommates, the family will swarm and put Ivy at risk. I don’t give a fuck what happens on that side of the household, but if anything happens to endanger Ivy and our unborn children, I’ll murder everyone in my path.”

Barris knew that to be true. Llyr would be inconsolable if anything happened to Ivy due to stress from being thrust into the family’s limelight. Sam probably wouldn’t be far behind him, and as dangerous as the divine were when they were on the warpath, a hybrid inside their birth realm had a huge upper hand in terms of power.

“Tell me, brother. If I haven’t earned your trust by now, I never will.”

It took Llyr longer than Barris would’ve liked, but when the words finally came, the hunter could’ve been knocked over with a feather. “Brayden got a woman pregnant before he died in the Titanic disaster.”

As was the way of their kind, when information became too much to cope with, Barris internalised, giving himself plenty of time to process everything that entailed. When he returned, he stepped away from Llyr and sat on the ochre seating around the firepit. “Does Yitzak know?”

Llyr sat adjacent to him and nodded. “Only in the last few weeks. The kid was unringed, and Sam gravitated towards him when he hit the city looking for somewhere to stay. Neither of them knew it at the time.” Llyr then glared at his family ring before shaking his hand between them. “If I hadn’t been wearing this damn thing, I’d have figured it out years ago through our familial link.”

Barris’ eyes widened. “You knew the kid…”

“Only as Sam’s protective older roommate. Looking back, he has Uncle Chance’s easy-goingness, and the guy reeks of Mystallian confidence.”

“So, Sam ended up in this kid’s apartment because he happened to live in the same city where Sam wanted to go to school. How the hell did you not see that as Uncle Chance’s line jumping up and down and waving its arms at you?”

“Because we don’t assume every human we come across to be a hybrid, and we certainly don’t expect to find them running around unringed. My understanding is Yitzak was brought in on it as soon as Columbine realised his ancestry.”

Barris huffed out a breath and leaned forward to rest his forearms on his knees. “What’s the kid’s name?”

“Robbie.”

“And what’s his innate?”

“Cooking.”

Barris huffed again, this time in amusement. “We finally get our own cook.” He glanced at his brother and pulled back when he realised there was more that his brother hadn’t said. “What else?”

“Cooking might be his innate … but he had to find his own way in the world before that.” Llyr worked his jaw as if what was coming next was too distasteful to admit. “Without the money to follow his innate, he drew on a calling from further up his family line.”

Barris squinted, and Llyr drew in an uncomfortable breath. “He became an exotic dancer and sex worker.”

*Aunt Emi.* Uncle Chance’s wife was the goddess of Love, Lust and Fertility. “Crap.”

“Yeah, and he sees nothing wrong with it. Fortunately, he has a girlfriend now with strong family values, so his days of working between the sheets are over. Plus, Yitzak’s set him up with family money the day they met, so he’ll never have to work like that again, even if he and his girlfriend break up.”

“Where do Dobson and Masters fit into all of that?”

“They were two more of Robbie’s original roommates who were living there before Sam moved in. Robbie’s girlfriend is Dobson’s little sister.”

“Still not seeing the connection here, bro.”

“Columbine gave Robbie extra Plus Ones.”

Barris was just about at his wit’s end. *“WHY?!”* he practically screamed.

“It’s her realm, brother. She can change the rules any time she wants, and in compensation for a century of living without the family, she gave him his father’s and grandfather’s Plus Ones, since they both passed in human lifetimes never knowing they were family.”

Barris’ brain came to a screeching halt. *The kid living with Sam isn’t Brayden’s son, but his great-grandson?*

It pissed Barris off that two generations had been born and lost to them. Still, after only a few seconds of internalising his anger, he accepted he would probably never cross paths with them, and their loss took a backseat to the relevant facts in play. “So Masters and Dobson are Plus Ones without being the partners of anyone divine. Robbie has basically been handed a harem.”

“If you want to look at it that way, except there’s a fourth in the mix. The last of the original roommates before Sam joined them has one too because Braydon never used his.”

“Four.” The word was flat and deadpan. “This fucking kid has *four* Plus Ones.” When Llyr didn’t react to Barris holding up four fingers for emphasis, the divine hunter started shaking his head. “If that right there isn’t Uncle Chance’s luck filtering through his line, I don’t know what is.”

Llyr rolled his eyes. “I know, right?”

Using filament switcher with dual extruders?,klippers,1hjn45w,2024-12-21 19:27:24,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/comments/1hjn45w/using_filament_switcher_with_dual_extruders/,GemingaJD,,"Hi! I am totally new to Klipper in general, and excuse me if this question is very basic:

Do the filament switcher systems, such as ERCF and Tradrack, work with dual extruder printers? It's fine if I have to make a few edits to the configuration files, but I have no interest in, say, completely re-writing the firmware for the filament switcher just to get it to work with dual extruders.

If that helps, I will be pairing the switcher a Formbot/Vivedino Marathon, which is an IDEX (Independent Dual EXtrusion) printer running Klipper. 



I know that this is a small niche, but it would be really helpful if I can get an IDEX set up with switchers since if I can get it to work, I can completely supersede my old Bambulab printer."
