Recently i have been trying to learn about the rewards game through this sub. My spends aggregate to \~8L to 12L a year with major spends being online (like amazon, D2C sites, etc.) and i usually spend low on travel (flight/hotel) to about 1 to 1.5L a year. Okay to travel/book hotels using rewards and thinking to get a card with higher reward rate. Which would be a better card? I'm confused between Amex plat travel and Axis Atlas; Please share your ideas and also suggest if any other card would work for me.

Now on to infinite galaxies quotes
On the other hand, the “galaxy” entry in the glossary section from page 49 of the same book instead seems to say there are infinite galaxies (again, from Chouzenshuu 4 but the Daizenshuu 7 original had the same wording)
[here](https://x.com/Herms98/status/1445405245891399685?t=tSPcP_-xypv7BMg3V_xGBA&s=19)

宇宙の中にある、局地的な星々の集まり。星が集まって星雲を作り、さらにいくつかの星雲が集まってできた集まりを銀河という。宇宙の東西南北を担当している4人の界王は、実際にはこの銀河を監視している。東西南北の銀河という区分は、天界の神々や界王たちが、宇宙空間に無限に存在する銀河を統括するために、業務上使い出した単位である。

https://imgur.com/a/OKMEXkD

A localized collection of stars in the universe. A collection of stars that come together to make a nebula, and a collection of nebulae is referred to as a galaxy. The 4 kaioshin, who are in charge of the east, west, north, and south of the universe, actually monitor these galaxies. The division of galaxies into east, west, north, south, is a unit used by kami and kaio of the heavenly realm for business purposes in order to supervise the infinite number of galaxies that exist in outer space.

無限に広がるる宇宙を、 それれぞれの界王達 が 管理 管理をしているるおもに方角によよっ て決められ、 界王が管理してていをしてい るるおもに方角によよって決められ、 界界 がが管理していいる場所てが宇宙を管理 最終 的に大界王神が全世界を監督していいここと になってい

The infinite universe is managed and controlled by each of the World Kings, mainly according to the direction in which they are located, and the World King manages the universe from the place where the World Kings are located.


The various Kaiō govern the infinitely expansive universe [of the living world]. This is primarily determined by the cardinal direction, while the Dai Kaiō serves as general manager of the places governed by the Kaiō, and beyond that the Kaiōshin of the North, South, East, and West govern the overall universe. Ultimately, the Dai Kaiōshin supervises the universe in its entirety. — “Dragon Ball Daizenshuu 4: World Guide” (p. 54)

#Counter arguments


Bulma stated that the universe has an edge and a center. People often use [this image](https://imgur.com/JHTzv6N) as evidence to debunk the infinite Dragon Ball universe, but it has a couple of issues with it.

Firstly, Bulma could just be referring to the observable universe. In the anime scan, she explicitly says she can't scan the entire area, so they need to go to the center of the universe to find what they're looking for. This indicates that Bulma’s statement about the universe having an edge and a center is based on her Dragon Ball radar’s limited range, as it cannot scan the entire area. Therefore, she has no real way of knowing the actual size of the universe.

Later on, Jaco comments on Bulma wanting to go to the center of the universe, calling her foolish for even attempting it because of the universe's vastness, composed of ""countless galaxies,"" making it impossible. [Here's the reference image.](https://imgur.com/1WSBqjs)

This shows that Bulma is not a credible source, and her statement shouldn't be taken seriously when considering cosmology, especially since we have never seen this so-called edge of the universe. 

Her statement should be considered as referring only to the observable universe, based on what her radar can pick up. It is also never proven true, and they end up going to Zuno just to find the Super Dragon Balls, which happened to be located in the neutral zone of the universes as the ""nameless planet.""

According to the official Dragon Ball episode summary on Toei's website, Jaco's statement is confirmed to be true, showing there is no way to go to the center of the vast universe. This indicates that Bulma’s claim is based only on her limited knowledge and her radar, which is not capable of picking up planets, stars, galaxies, or any other celestial bodies—it specifically locates Dragon Balls. Thus, her statement about the universe’s edge and center is based on virtually nothing but her own assumptions, making her an unreliable source regarding the actual size of the universe.

You can find the episode summary on Toei's website [here](https://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/dragon_s/episode/summary/31/).

In Summary, Bulma’s statement is merely a knowledge claim based on her knowledge and not a objective factual statement about the universe's size.



#Conclusion 

the Universe is infinite in size


#Suguroku dimension

-A dimension that seperates the afterlife and the mortal realm [It is stated to be infinite in sized](https://imgur.com/a/UTLcl8y)


#Afterlife 

(天よりも高く人間界からは　い知ることができない次元を超越した天の国神々はこの地から世界のすべてを見おろしている 


Ten yori mo takaku ningen-kai kara wa i shiru koto ga dekinai **jigen** o **chōetsu-shīta** ten no kuni, kamigami wa kono ji kara-sekai no subete o mioroshite iru)

=

""Soaring higher than heavens

A world that transcends the dimensions and understanding of the human world.

“From here, the gods watch over the world”


#First proving why the afterlife has qualitative superiority

**In vsbw Higher dimension doesn’t necessarily always mean it is Low-1C because you need to prove that it has qualitative superiority or in other words prove that it is not finite in size**


https://imgur.com/a/Pcq7f3h

It is generally accepted that the living universe is infinite, (Even Vsbw agrees) which implies that Heaven is also infinite in size. The Afterlife not only includes Heaven but is so vast that it makes Heaven completely disappear within its great expanse. This is evident from the fact that Heaven is located above Snake Way and King Kai's planet on the official macrocosm map. However, when we get an overall top view from Snake Way in episode 12 of Dragon Ball Z, [Heaven is nowhere to be seen,](https://imgur.com/a/OSwvOm4 ) (Proving the afterlife superiority to heaven)



The same is also shown when Goku first visits King Kai in episode 18 DBZ, where looking Up doesn’t show any signs of heaven being present Therefore, the context clearly shows that the Afterlife is uncountably larger than Heaven, which is infinite in size. This makes the Afterlife infinitely larger than Heaven, proving its superiority over it.

#Counter Arguments


**Wa..wait but doesn’t the scan uses the word transcendental? and it could also be talking about afterlife having spiritual transcendence (Spiritual) rather than a dimensional Transcendence? (Mathematical)**

NO that is wrong the scan doesn’t say transcendental that is a misconception since the kanji used in the scan is  **”超越した”** ( **(Chouetsushita)** which translates to it transcending or being transcendent rather than **transcendental which is described by the kanji “超越的” (Chouetsuteki).**

**In other words Herms translation was incorrect**

Moreover, **”transcendental""** is restricted to being an adjective. Japanese follows an SOV structure (Subject-Object-Verb), meaning the subject comes first, followed by the object and then the verb, while adjectives come before the noun they describe, similar to English. Here, ""超越"" (Chouetsu) comes after the noun it refers to, which is ""次元"" (Jigen). This indicates that ""超越"" in this context is not an adjective but a verb.

**Some of yall would argue that the scan refers to spiritual transcendence, but this is very very unlikely and also disproven by the terminology used in the scan: ""次元を超越した天の国"" (Jigen o chōetsu shita ten no kuni). The term ""次元"" (Jigen) refers to a mathematical or spatial dimension,** Implying that the transcendence being referred to is in the mathematical context Furthermore, the context, which mentions that the Afterlife cannot be perceived by mortals, suggests that the Afterlife is undeniably a higher dimension.**


#Another Important Point

**Even if the scan was talking about spiritual enlightenment it still wouldn’t matter because**

The afterlife’s in Asian mythology are almost inherently **higher planes of existence.** There’s also the fact that the afterlife **trivializes** heaven. With the arguments for [The living world being infinite](https://vsbattles.com/threads/dragon-ball-infinite-universe.151694/ )  

in conjunction with [Heaven being stated to be the same size as the living world](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/0/0f/Received_1518769161544672.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/364?cb=20171121045221 ) this could make the afterlife **infinitely** larger than the living world, which accords with [hausdorff dimension theory](https://character-stats-and-profiles.fandom.com/wiki/Tiering_System ) of higher dimensional spaces being **inaccessibly more massive** than lower ones this also aligns with the string theory Just as string theory's **extra dimensions** are not directly observable to us, the afterlife as a higher dimension would be beyond human perception, aligning with the notion of dimensional transcendence.

the afterlife being qualitatively and quantitatively superior, means it is infinitely larger than the living world. In string theory, higher-dimensional spaces are vastly more complex and massive than the lower ones

**In short The spiritual argument has no real basis**


**And time also exists in afterlife but it works very differently from the living worlds time**

temporal axis while being bound to the higher temporal dimension of the space-time continuum) or that there are times when the afterlife is shown to have no time dilation effect relative to the living world such as when Goku need to rush back from the afterlife: a problem that wouldn't exist if the afterlife was beyond the living world's time. the afterlife being 'outside time' is a topic for another time.

**which means that the afterlife contains a higher temporal dimension**

**Now that I have disproven The spiritual Arguments lets now go to the Anime Statements**

**Extras to support the afterlife argument**


[Piccolo has referred to the afterlife as a higher dimension](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerScaling/s/7YjcpMWtzx)


The Narrator Has also referred to the Living world as a lower realm


Gohan has called the living world as a lower realm

[The Living world or Human World is referred to as a lower temporal dimension The episode is 266](https://imgur.com/a/living-universe-is-stated-to-be-lower-realm-temporal-world-4IIHZth)

[The Guidebooks have also referred to the afterlife as an extra dimension compared to the living world which in this context refers to a higher dimension](https://imgur.com/a/WCnYKWV) The kanji used for extra dimensional space is 異次元空間” which refers to dimensions outside the universe the Extra Dimensional Space literally fits this definition **this also further strengthens the idea of Jigen referring to dimensions instead of realms (Spiritual context)**

The RPG guidebook that stated that the afterlife is a higher dimension is also canon 


**Proving that the RPG Guidebook is Canon**

1. First off, the makers of [Dragon Ball Z: The Anime Adventure Game] obtained an official license for permission to release the game in America. 

[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/its-about-time-we-discussed-dragon-balls-afterlife-scans-v0-yyvdia2x1q1b1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=d17d8b69ab3e5a7c90356ad43189f3bb7c41815b) 

2. One of the guidebook's writers, Cindy Brennan Fukunaga, was the executive producer for most of the original Dragon Ball and a good portion of Dragon Ball Z:

3. Toriyama himself was involved with the project, the guidebook clearly has his soft approval. Toriyama has stated before that he considers his staff and others who work on extended Dragon Ball material to be more knowledgable on Dragon Ball than himself.

[Image 3](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fits-about-time-we-discussed-dragon-balls-afterlife-scans-v0-qdyam1343q1b1.png%3Fwidth%3D1185%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D162016a90ff64922b02764e9e43f5c45eaaed58e)

5. An editor's note explained that everything from the game guide was extrapolated reasonably from canon information and guidebooks as well as Toriyama's ideas, making it very illogical to call the RPG guide's information as 'headcanon and non canon.’

**Temporal Axes act as infinitesimal snapshots of the Spatial Nature of a Universe at any given point, the sum of which comprises the Totality of Space-Time. As such, they are always significant as it pertains to Tiering. The existence of Time in the Afterlife would Mathematically be exhibited as (R\*R\*R\*R)\*R or R\^5, significantly 5-Dimensional. With all of this laid out, Dragon Ball’s Other World or afterlife should by all means qualify for Low 1-C or 5th dimensional.


#Conclusion

The Afterlife is 5-dimensional (5D).

#SWIRLING LIGHTS 

**What is the Dimension of Swirling Lights?**

In Dragon Ball Super: Broly Movie, the clash between Gogeta and Broly [Was so powerful it Destroyed reality](https://youtu.be/rTzTJLz51fQ) and forced the pair into a [Dimension of Strange Swirling Lights.](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Dimension_of_Strange_Swirling_Lights)

**Evidence 1**

This setting or place was described in the [Broly Anime Comic](https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Super-Broly-Theatrical-Comics/dp/4088820029) as [super-dimensional](https://ibb.co/r4H1SMP) [several](https://ibb.co/BGwbrGW) different [times.](https://ibb.co/5xWL6x7) The kanji used here refers to a [higher dimensional spaces](https://ibb.co/7rqGNcB) ([spaces with extra dimensional axes](https://ibb.co/922fhjj)).

#Interview 


The production and animation team for the Broly movie [was interviewed on the film's special effects](https://dragonball.news/news/dbmfl28.html) under an article from the official Dragon Ball Website. Here, it was stated that the team's purpose was to create [a super-dimensional images](https://ibb.co/GcQd203) with the use of CGI **Again the swirling lights is referred to as a super dimension which in this case likely means a higher dimension**


[It was stated that under the process of CGI,](https://ibb.co/v3ZwQTH) Typically, a reference image of a natural setting like a wilderness or the sea is used to create 3-dimensional imagery. However, this time, the modelers used mathematical formulas to create a space based on elements that do not exist in reality, as if it were from a different dimension. 

The kanji used for 'different dimension' in the article is [異空間], which directly translates to 'different space' and seems to refer to an external space with different laws. One common interpretation of [異空間] [is that it refers to higher-dimensional spaces which in this case is very likely due to the Swirling Lights being called and referred too as “Super Dimension”](https://ibb.co/Q8R12NV)


Later on however, they said that to portray this space in a 3 Dimensional format, [they expressed different dimensions using mathematical formulas as a model.](https://ibb.co/YhjSJ0H) Different dimension(s) \[異次元\] in the context of science and sci-fi refers to [worlds with dimensions distinct/different from the ordinary](https://ibb.co/MRZwyHC); [an idea that encompasses both a fantasy concept of alternate worlds and mathematical concepts of dimensions to denote a world that occupies a higher dimension](https://ibb.co/XJHbW9d).

They stated the Dimension of Swirling Lights couldn't be constructed with standard 3-D modeling, so they had to generate its environment by expressing the dimension(s) as mathematical formulas that you wouldn't expect humans to comprehend. This loaded statement seems to carry heavy connotations as far as higher mathematical dimensions go. For instance, with tesseracts (which represent higher dimensional space), their volume is [based on mathematical formulas,](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/four_dimensions/index.html) humans [can't generally](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/217101) comprehend [such expressions,](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2287777) and modeling them visually [is considered the equivalent of modeling abstruse mathematics in the third dimension.](https://www.instructables.com/3d-4-Dimensional-Tesseract-Hypercube-Model-A-TJT3/) Not to mention, the first research link I provided explained ""super-dimensional imagery"" as something 3-dimensional portrayed in 2-dimensional imaging space while the second one explained ""super-dimensional reconstruction"" as creating 3-dimensional structures from 2-dimensional reference images: thus My Conclusion is that the dimension shown from the Broly movie were higher dimensional spaces that the movie production team aimed to portray in the 3D format using CGI.


#Where is the Dimension of Swirling Lights located?

It was stated that this dimension was reached by [distorting space-time](https://vsbattles.com/threads/official-translation-requests-thread-new-forum.107531/post-5704252), [breaching the limits of the universe](https://imgur.com/a/6yiKCol), [Tearing dimensional walls apart](https://twitter.com/Herms98/status/1453172630983348227?s=20), [then ""disintegrating"" the dimension to leave it](https://imgur.com/a/6yiKCol). [Their power was stated to be too much for the universe to handle.](https://imgur.com/a/SkIvbOM) In Dragon Ball, ""the universe"" [refers to the living world](https://vsbattles.com/threads/dragon-ball-cosmology-minor-revision.153563/) more often than the macrocosm as a whole. It would definitely make more sense if the Dimension of Swirling Lights encompassed the living world \[or at bare minimum, is an adjacent space-time\] since breaking the living world's space-time fabric leads directly to it and back from it **Could be argued for 6D**

#Where would this scale to?


**However since the size of this dimension is not explicitly specified this dimension would fall into the insignificant 5-D / 6-D but since it is referred to as a dimension / realm it should have its own space and time continuum Time Captures an uncountable amount of moments**

**Temporal Axes act as infinitesimal snapshots of the Spatial Nature of a Universe at any given point, the sum of which comprises the Totality of Space-Time. As such, they are always significant as it pertains to Tiering. The existence of Time in the Swirling Light’s dimension would Mathematically be exhibited as (R\*R\*R\*R)\*R or R\^5, significantly 5-Dimensional. With all of this laid out, Dragon Ball’s Swirling Lights Dimension should by all means qualify for Low 1-C or a significant 5th dimension**

 
#Conclusion

General Theory of relativity describes The Universe containing 3 Spatial Dimensions with 1 Temporal/Time Dimension. However, since we know the Dimension of Swirling Lights was intended to be a higher dimensional space beyond the living world, this would make the macrocosm consist of at least 4 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time: making universe 7 likely 5-D



#Multiverse Section


#Neutral Void/Insignificant 6D

**Description**

*Neutral Void - A space that holds all 12 Universes in dragon ball super in parallel pairs the tournament between Universe 7 and 6 is held in a nameless planet that lies within a void called a neutral space*

**First I will explain the current explanation for the neutral void**

Imagine two parallel lines

For two parallel lines to be displaced in such a way that no matter how much you extend its sides it will still stay parallel the environment or space they are in must be  3-D same goes with the neutral space holding parallel 4D macrocosm the neutral space must be a 5-D

#First Evidence

[First Image when super shenron was summoned the view zooms out revealing celestial bodies but no universe 7 nor 6 can even be seen in the distance implying that it may possibly dwarf both infinite size macrocosm](https://imgur.com/a/D6MgEbS)

#Second Evidence


**This is the most important scan**

[Many of you all know that dragon ball super uses circle structure containing the Universes as a way to represent them during the super shenron summoning the view zooms out revealing Universe 6 further in the distance the neutral void is still there meaning it encompasses both universe and possibly all 12 universes](https://imgur.com/a/X3iXY6h) this also means it dwarfs all 12 Universes which literally qualifies for significance 

[Macrocosm are represented as a galaxy like structure contained in a ball](https://imgur.com/a/SaPrq3W)



#Evidence 3

[The view zooms out again yet no universe can be seen](https://imgur.com/a/3yyRkkc)

In vsbw for a higher dimensional structure to be considered significant it must have a showing of qualitative superiority over lower dimensions such as embedding lower dimensional spaces or dwarfing an infinite size lower dimensional structure 



#Argument 1

The Neutral Void is shown encompassing both Universe 6 and 7 with both of them being infinite in size which qualifies for significance



#Argument  2

Both universe 7 and 6 are shown to not be visible to the main cast which implies that the neutral void dwarfs all 12 Universes this means it dwarfs all 12 Universes which again qualifies as significant 


#Argument 3

The neutral void is its own dimension and is another space and time continuum time captures an uncountable amount of moments which would capture an uncountable amount of the neutral void making it significant this is supported by hit someone who is able to manipulate time being able to manipulate time in the neutral space 

Which mean that time exists in it since time can be divided infinitely between decimals and time is infinitely long this would mean that the Neutral Void is in fact a significant 5-D space 

#Conclusion 

The neutral void is undeniably a significant 5-D

**Since each Macrocosm are at least 5D this would make the neutral void 6D**



#Zeno’s realm

-Not much known about it but what we know so far is that it any interaction with the representation of the living matter of the universe also affects reality itself and it also beyond even the neutral void which contains all 12 Infinite Size Macrocosms 

which can qualify for bulk space which can mean the zeno realm is higher dimension but we cannot say this for certain so it is just another Space and Time continuum but if you want to high ball it then it would 7D





#Timeline Section

#Hypertimelines

I am not knowledgeable about hypertimlines But i will try my best to explain it but feel free to correct me if i am wrong

Imagine space-time as a series of movie frames aligned under an extensive line. We could think of these frames as ""snapshots:"" static representations of the cosmos at a given time. Meanwhile, this line we call time extends infinitely to encompass the past, present, and future. Time is a continuum: a continuous parameter. This means it isn't measured in discrete values. So not only does a timeline encompass infinite seconds, days, and years, but it contains every infinitesimal value in between. This is why Vs Wiki's explanation noted that a standard timeline is the equivalent of uncountably infinite snapshots of 3-dimensional volume. Time can be infinitely subdivided into infinitesimally small moments, each corresponding to a unique snapshot of the universe, culminating in a scope that can't be represented by an infinite set of real numbers.
If you've ever wondered why destroying the fabric of space-time is considered infinitely greater than destroying matter on a universal scale (3-A<low 2-C), that's why. A timeline contains snapshots for the past, present, and future, and destroying one is like destroying a universe uncountably infinitely many times over. Going back to the bolded question above, a timeline's uncountable infinity isn't determined by the space under it, but the number of snapshots it holds. It's the same reason time is considered the 4th dimension and a higher infinity whether the universe it defines is finite or infinite.

**So with the Neutral Void being 6D this would scale a single hypertimeline to 7D-8D depending if you accept that the zeno realm is also a higher dimension**



#Another Space dimension 

Next is the space between timelines, as we already know, we see the space between timelines that trunks uses to travel between them, it’s depicted in a model in the dbs manga, and [its depicted in the anime as a brown space, and there’s also a depiction of it in the dbz kai anime. It depicts that the timelines are obviously parallel to each other,](https://imgur.com/a/va2Hmy6 )and as we know, for parallel timelines to be held in the same space, that space must be higher dimensional. So this means that this space between timelines is **8D**. Which is still not the absolute limit of the entire dragon ball cosmology




#MANY WOLRD INTERPRETATIONS

https://imgur.com/a/c7pn3J8

ENGLISH TRANSLATION 
The future of the world was saved because Goku and Gohan defeated Cell, but in the future in which Trunks lived, it is he who defeats Cell. In other words, the fact that Goku was cured of the fatal disease created at least two different futures, just as there is a future in which Trunks is killed by Cell. A small detail altered in the past can create countless parallel worlds.

Another Evidence 

https://imgur.com/a/hO06naf
By the way, Shin himself has a time ring, which further confirms that there are other parallel worlds in Universe 7


another one here

https://imgur.com/a/tLEWtBa
It is said that all Kaioshins have their own rings, refuting the fact that there are only 5 timelines, but there are several other parallel worlds in the 12 Universes.

Launched in Japan in 2003 by Shueisha and in Brazil by Conrad in 2005, the Dragon Ball Z Encyclopedia


The website itself mentions that Kaioshin are capable of going to parallel worlds in their Universes

https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_1877.html
He kills his former master, Supreme Kai Gowasu, and steals his Ring of Time, a tool that allows the Supreme Kais to travel between parallel timelines. He discovers Future Trunks' timeline where the Supreme Kai and God of Destruction had already passed away and heads there to destroy it, thereby becoming its one and only god.

https://imgur.com/a/PuGtCtf
Well... For those who don't know, there is a room full of time rings only in Universe 10

https://imgur.com/a/w2cZaE1
Shin mentions that he has traveled to several parallel worlds, multiple times, which means that it was not just 5 parallel worlds, but several of them.

Those time rings are only for Universe 10, where he travels through the future to their respective Universes

Yes, there is solid evidence that the work works with MWI, the website itself mentions it, talking about time travel


**Parallel Worlds and Time Paradoxes**


https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_708.html

ow that we've all hopefully got at least a vague understanding of how time machines could work, I decided to ask about parallel worlds and time paradoxes. Time paradoxes occur when some kind of contradiction or loop is created due to your travels to and from the past and future, and in order to enable time travel, we'd have to find a way to resolve them.Even within Dragon Ball, Trunks altered his universe's history slightly by going back to the past to discover the Androids' weakness. It's this process that gives rise to multiple futures, i.e., parallel worlds.

https://imgur.com/a/XaCyyva

Being a crime does not guarantee you to refute MWI, especially because parallel worlds are created by smaller things, with thousands of them existing through simple time travel.


Furthermore, in the anime itself it is shown that there are other parallel worlds besides those mentioned in Universe 10

https://imgur.com/a/iVj86tS#LtK9rLN

Not only that, but the following is said on the official Dragon Ball website

https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_2350.html

Three years pass, and Androids 19 and 20 attack South City. Once again Trunks returns from the future, but the Androids that attacked South City are not the Androids that Trunks knows. One small change in history can cause many possible futures, so it seems that the past that Trunks arrived in was not the past he knew.

**All of this is supported by the fact that GT and Daima are canon**




#GT IS CANON TO DRAGON 

[Akira toriyama the author of Dragon ball has stated that he considers GT as an alternate history of the original dragon ball series](https://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/dragon-book-gt-toriyama-intro/ ) questioning their status. However, Toei Animation (the animation studio behind the entire franchise) and Shueisha (the publisher behind the manga) recognized 'GT' as an official part of the canon in the timelines presented at the screenings.

In 1993, Akira Toriyama entrusted Takao Koyama with the new story of the little robot and for the designs he chooses Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru (creator of SS4). That manga is titled ""The Return Of Dr. Slump"" and is the official continuation of the story that ended in 1984. (Which means Arale is canon to Dragon ball)

Akira toriyama made many contributions to GT, every interview here

#Conclusion DBS has the many worlds interpretations 






**Extra Information Alternate Dimensions**


* It’s shown to be [Impossible to travel to the Afterlife](https://imgur.com/a/C794Se4 )without special methods. 


* Also, travel to the Kaioshin realm is not possible [Without Teleportation](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/b/be/1071594612575174787-1073090053066195004-image0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230803131657 )


* The Universe/Universe 7 and Afterlife are stated to be [Seperated from space and time](https://streamable.com/cniakr )Uses Jiku which refers to 4D Space-Time). The 2 realms are also infinite in size qualifying too.


* The Sugoroku Space is a space
* [between The afterlife and the living world](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/9/9d/1049176589964935218-1093662136867225721-IMG-4952.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230804081019)


* Also, although it doesn’t prove separation of space-times alone different time flow can be supporting evidence.

[More proof for the seperation between the afterlife and the living world](https://imgur.com/a/pZtdn9i)

[The Living world or Human World is referred to as a lower temporal dimension The episode is 266 this means that the afterlife has a higher dimensional axis](https://imgur.com/a/living-universe-is-stated-to-be-lower-realm-temporal-world-4IIHZth)

* The RoSaT is stated to have a [Different Time dimension](https://imgur.com/a/room-of-spirit-time-has-different-time-dimension-dPoCXaT)

* comparitive to realms like the Kaioshin Realm and Living World, which means their spatio-temporal separation involves distinct time dimensions.
* There is a room inside the Living World that creates [space and time](https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:ProfectusInfinity/Time_Room_%26_Dragon_Ball_Cosmology )confirming that it’s serviced by its own time dimension

* Subspace (a Space That Lacks No Concept Of space Or Time)[https://imgur.com/a/dragon-ball-subspace-W3ZhG3g] 

That is all I think this should be enough to prove that the DBS Cosmology scales much much higher than just 5D 

Just msg me if I missed something 

**In conclusion the entire DBS cosmology scales to at least to infinite 8D-9D**

"Help with Integrating Lian Li TL LCD, SL Fans, and Corsair iCUE Cooler into One Synced System",lianli,1i9c3tn,2025-01-24 20:46:56,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/lianli/comments/1i9c3tn/help_with_integrating_lian_li_tl_lcd_sl_fans_and/,Narrow_Driver_2726,Question,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on setting up my PC and need advice on integrating different fans and components into one synchronized lighting system while keeping advanced features functional. Here’s my setup:

* **Fans:**
   * 3x Lian Li UNI Fan TL LCD 140mm (with LCD displays).
   * 2x Lian Li UNI Fan SL-Infinity (120mm).
* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE Link H150i RGB Liquid CPU Cooler (360mm AIO).
* **Motherboard:** Gigabyte B650 AORUS ELITE AX.

# What I Want to Achieve:

1. Keep **full functionality of the LCD displays** on the TL LCD fans (using L-Connect 3 software).
2. Have **synchronized RGB lighting effects** across all components, including the Corsair cooler, TL fans, and SL fans.
3. Retain independent control of the Corsair cooler’s pump and temperatures in iCUE, but have its lighting effects synced with the fans.

# Proposed Setup:

1. **TL LCD Fans:**
   * Connect to the Lian Li TL controller.
   * Connect the controller’s 3-pin ARGB output to a motherboard 5V ARGB header.
   * Enable **Motherboard Sync Mode** in L-Connect 3 for lighting synchronization.
2. **SL Fans:**
   * Connect to the Lian Li SL controller.
   * Connect the SL controller’s 3-pin ARGB output to another motherboard 5V ARGB header.
   * Enable **Motherboard Sync Mode** in L-Connect 3.
3. **Corsair Cooler:**
   * Use the cooler’s ARGB passthrough cable (if available) to connect it to a third 5V ARGB header on the motherboard.
   * Use iCUE for pump and temperature control.
4. **Lighting Sync:**
   * Use Gigabyte RGB Fusion to control lighting effects for all ARGB devices (TL fans, SL fans, and Corsair cooler).
   * Keep L-Connect 3 active to customize TL LCD fan displays and control fan speeds.

# Questions:

1. Will this setup work as described?
2. Can I achieve synchronized lighting effects through RGB Fusion while still using L-Connect 3 to control the TL LCD fan displays and fan speeds?
3. Are there any potential issues with having both the TL and SL controllers connected to the motherboard ARGB headers alongside the Corsair cooler?
4. Any tips for managing USB 2.0 headers if I run out? (I’m already using two for the controllers.)

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

(Yes I Know This Is My 5th time updating it but I have gathered some new scans and info that I wasn’t able to mention in the Post)

**I will be also including the Dragon Ball Super Heroes cosmology in the Post**


**I will Seperate the cosmology into sections to make it easier to read and understand**





#Macrocosm Section




First Lets discuss the different Realms found in the Dragon ball franchise 

#First The Living World
The Living world Is stated Numerous times to be Infinite In size here

Galactic illuminations and darkness that stretches infinitely, tens of thousands of light years, hundreds of millions of light years, where not even light can reach. Countless aliens and unknown monsters that defy the imagination live beyond the stars""

It's also mentioned in the newest Dragon Ball guide, which contains things from Dragon Ball super
スケールを持つ世界観であることがわかるだろう

https://imgur.com/a/JbISgEM

""This World"" shows an infinite expanse, you will discover that the DB world has a worldview with a tremendous scale beyond human comprehension.

Now on to infinite galaxies quotes
On the other hand, the “galaxy” entry in the glossary section from page 49 of the same book instead seems to say there are infinite galaxies (again, from Chouzenshuu 4 but the Daizenshuu 7 original had the same wording)
[here](https://x.com/Herms98/status/1445405245891399685?t=tSPcP_-xypv7BMg3V_xGBA&s=19)

宇宙の中にある、局地的な星々の集まり。星が集まって星雲を作り、さらにいくつかの星雲が集まってできた集まりを銀河という。宇宙の東西南北を担当している4人の界王は、実際にはこの銀河を監視している。東西南北の銀河という区分は、天界の神々や界王たちが、宇宙空間に無限に存在する銀河を統括するために、業務上使い出した単位である。

A localized collection of stars in the universe. A collection of stars that come together to make a nebula, and a collection of nebulae is referred to as a galaxy. The 4 kaioshin, who are in charge of the east, west, north, and south of the universe, actually monitor these galaxies. The division of galaxies into east, west, north, south, is a unit used by kami and kaio of the heavenly realm for business purposes in order to supervise the infinite number of galaxies that exist in outer space.

無限に広がるる宇宙を、 それれぞれの界王達 が 管理 管理をしているるおもに方角によよっ て決められ、 界王が管理してていをしてい るるおもに方角によよって決められ、 界界 がが管理していいる場所てが宇宙を管理 最終 的に大界王神が全世界を監督していいここと になってい

The infinite universe is managed and controlled by each of the World Kings, mainly according to the direction in which they are located, and the World King manages the universe from the place where the World Kings are located.


The various Kaiō govern the infinitely expansive universe [of the living world]. This is primarily determined by the cardinal direction, while the Dai Kaiō serves as general manager of the places governed by the Kaiō, and beyond that the Kaiōshin of the North, South, East, and West govern the overall universe. Ultimately, the Dai Kaiōshin supervises the universe in its entirety. — “Dragon Ball Daizenshuu 4: World Guide” (p. 54)

#Counter arguments


Bulma stated that the universe has an edge and a center. People often use [this image](https://imgur.com/JHTzv6N) as evidence to debunk the infinite Dragon Ball universe, but it has a couple of issues with it.

Firstly, Bulma could just be referring to the observable universe. In the anime scan, she explicitly says she can't scan the entire area, so they need to go to the center of the universe to find what they're looking for. This indicates that Bulma’s statement about the universe having an edge and a center is based on her Dragon Ball radar’s limited range, as it cannot scan the entire area. Therefore, she has no real way of knowing the actual size of the universe.

Later on, Jaco comments on Bulma wanting to go to the center of the universe, calling her foolish for even attempting it because of the universe's vastness, composed of ""countless galaxies,"" making it impossible. [Here's the reference image.](https://imgur.com/1WSBqjs)

This shows that Bulma is not a credible source, and her statement shouldn't be taken seriously when considering cosmology, especially since we have never seen this so-called edge of the universe. 

Her statement should be considered as referring only to the observable universe, based on what her radar can pick up. It is also never proven true, and they end up going to Zuno just to find the Super Dragon Balls, which happened to be located in the neutral zone of the universes as the ""nameless planet.""

According to the official Dragon Ball episode summary on Toei's website, Jaco's statement is confirmed to be true, showing there is no way to go to the center of the vast universe. This indicates that Bulma’s claim is based only on her limited knowledge and her radar, which is not capable of picking up planets, stars, galaxies, or any other celestial bodies—it specifically locates Dragon Balls. Thus, her statement about the universe’s edge and center is based on virtually nothing but her own assumptions, making her an unreliable source regarding the actual size of the universe.

You can find the episode summary on Toei's website [here](https://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/dragon_s/episode/summary/31/).

In Summary, Bulma’s statement is merely a knowledge claim based on her knowledge and not a objective factual statement about the universe's size.



#Conclusion 

the Universe is infinite in size


#Suguroku dimension

-A dimension that seperates the afterlife and the mortal realm [It is stated to be infinite in sized](https://imgur.com/a/UTLcl8y)


(天よりも高く人間界からは　い知ることができない次元を超越した天の国神々はこの地から世界のすべてを見おろしている 


Ten yori mo takaku ningen-kai kara wa i shiru koto ga dekinai **jigen** o **chōetsu-shīta** ten no kuni, kamigami wa kono ji kara-sekai no subete o mioroshite iru)

=

""Soaring higher than heavens

A world that transcends the dimensions and understanding of the human world.

“From here, the gods watch over the world”


#First proving why the afterlife has qualitative superiority

**In vsbw Higher dimension doesn’t necessarily always mean it is Low-1C because you need to prove that it has qualitative superiority or in other words prove that it is not finite in size**


https://imgur.com/a/Pcq7f3h

It is generally accepted that the living universe is infinite, (Even Vsbw agrees) which implies that Heaven is also infinite in size. The Afterlife not only includes Heaven but is so vast that it makes Heaven completely disappear within its great expanse. This is evident from the fact that Heaven is located above Snake Way and King Kai's planet on the official macrocosm map. However, when we get an overall top view from Snake Way in episode 12 of Dragon Ball Z, [Heaven is nowhere to be seen,](https://imgur.com/a/OSwvOm4 ) (Proving the afterlife superiority to heaven)



The same is also shown when Goku first visits King Kai in episode 18 DBZ, where looking Up doesn’t show any signs of heaven being present Therefore, the context clearly shows that the Afterlife is uncountably larger than Heaven, which is infinite in size. This makes the Afterlife infinitely larger than Heaven, proving its superiority over it.

#Counter Arguments


**Wa..wait but doesn’t the scan uses the word transcendental? and it could also be talking about afterlife having spiritual transcendence (Spiritual) rather than a dimensional Transcendence? (Mathematical)**

NO that is wrong the scan doesn’t say transcendental that is a misconception since the kanji used in the scan is  **”超越した”** ( **(Chouetsushita)** which translates to it transcending or being transcendent rather than **transcendental which is described by the kanji “超越的” (Chouetsuteki).**

**In other words Herms translation was incorrect**

Moreover, **”transcendental""** is restricted to being an adjective. Japanese follows an SOV structure (Subject-Object-Verb), meaning the subject comes first, followed by the object and then the verb, while adjectives come before the noun they describe, similar to English. Here, ""超越"" (Chouetsu) comes after the noun it refers to, which is ""次元"" (Jigen). This indicates that ""超越"" in this context is not an adjective but a verb.

**Some of yall would argue that the scan refers to spiritual transcendence, but this is very very unlikely and also disproven by the terminology used in the scan: ""次元を超越した天の国"" (Jigen o chōetsu shita ten no kuni). The term ""次元"" (Jigen) refers to a mathematical or spatial dimension,** Implying that the transcendence being referred to is in the mathematical context Furthermore, the context, which mentions that the Afterlife cannot be perceived by mortals, suggests that the Afterlife is undeniably a higher dimension.**


#Another Important Point

**Even if the scan was talking about spiritual enlightenment it still wouldn’t matter because**

The afterlife’s in Asian mythology are almost inherently **higher planes of existence.** There’s also the fact that the afterlife **trivializes** heaven. With the arguments for [The living world being infinite](https://vsbattles.com/threads/dragon-ball-infinite-universe.151694/ )  

in conjunction with [Heaven being stated to be the same size as the living world](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/0/0f/Received_1518769161544672.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/364?cb=20171121045221 ) this could make the afterlife **infinitely** larger than the living world, which accords with [hausdorff dimension theory](https://character-stats-and-profiles.fandom.com/wiki/Tiering_System ) of higher dimensional spaces being **inaccessibly more massive** than lower ones this also aligns with the string theory Just as string theory's **extra dimensions** are not directly observable to us, the afterlife as a higher dimension would be beyond human perception, aligning with the notion of dimensional transcendence.

the afterlife being qualitatively and quantitatively superior, means it is infinitely larger than the living world. In string theory, higher-dimensional spaces are vastly more complex and massive than the lower ones

**In short The spiritual argument has no real basis**


**And time also exists in afterlife but it works very differently from the living worlds time**

temporal axis while being bound to the higher temporal dimension of the space-time continuum) or that there are times when the afterlife is shown to have no time dilation effect relative to the living world such as when Goku need to rush back from the afterlife: a problem that wouldn't exist if the afterlife was beyond the living world's time. the afterlife being 'outside time' is a topic for another time.

**which means that the afterlife contains a higher temporal dimension**

**Now that I have disproven The spiritual Arguments lets now go to the Anime Statements**

**Extras to support the afterlife argument**


[Piccolo has referred to the afterlife as a higher dimension](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerScaling/s/7YjcpMWtzx)


The Narrator Has also referred to the Living world as a lower realm


Gohan has called the living world as a lower realm

[The Living world or Human World is referred to as a lower temporal dimension The episode is 266](https://imgur.com/a/living-universe-is-stated-to-be-lower-realm-temporal-world-4IIHZth)

[The Guidebooks have also referred to the afterlife as an extra dimension compared to the living world which in this context refers to a higher dimension](https://imgur.com/a/WCnYKWV) The kanji used for extra dimensional space is 異次元空間” which refers to dimensions outside the universe the Extra Dimensional Space literally fits this definition **this also further strengthens the idea of Jigen referring to dimensions instead of realms (Spiritual context)**

The RPG guidebook that stated that the afterlife is a higher dimension is also canon 


**Proving that the RPG Guidebook is Canon**

1. First off, the makers of [Dragon Ball Z: The Anime Adventure Game] obtained an official license for permission to release the game in America. 

[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/its-about-time-we-discussed-dragon-balls-afterlife-scans-v0-yyvdia2x1q1b1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=d17d8b69ab3e5a7c90356ad43189f3bb7c41815b) 

2. One of the guidebook's writers, Cindy Brennan Fukunaga, was the executive producer for most of the original Dragon Ball and a good portion of Dragon Ball Z:

[Image 2](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fits-about-time-we-discussed-dragon-balls-afterlife-scans-v0-angg6dad2q1b1.png%3Fwidth%3D1031%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D707073275e5eff58eef290cb5a531ca472838696)

3. Toriyama himself was involved with the project, the guidebook clearly has his soft approval. Toriyama has stated before that he considers his staff and others who work on extended Dragon Ball material to be more knowledgable on Dragon Ball than himself.

[Image 3](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fits-about-time-we-discussed-dragon-balls-afterlife-scans-v0-qdyam1343q1b1.png%3Fwidth%3D1185%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D162016a90ff64922b02764e9e43f5c45eaaed58e)

5. An editor's note explained that everything from the game guide was extrapolated reasonably from canon information and guidebooks as well as Toriyama's ideas, making it very illogical to call the RPG guide's information as 'headcanon and non canon.’

**Temporal Axes act as infinitesimal snapshots of the Spatial Nature of a Universe at any given point, the sum of which comprises the Totality of Space-Time. As such, they are always significant as it pertains to Tiering. The existence of Time in the Afterlife would Mathematically be exhibited as (R\*R\*R\*R)\*R or R\^5, significantly 5-Dimensional. With all of this laid out, Dragon Ball’s Other World or afterlife should by all means qualify for Low 1-C or 5th dimensional.

The Afterlife is 5-dimensional (5D).

#SWIRLING LIGHTS 

**What is the Dimension of Swirling Lights?**

In Dragon Ball Super: Broly Movie, the clash between Gogeta and Broly [Was so powerful it Destroyed reality](https://youtu.be/rTzTJLz51fQ) and forced the pair into a [Dimension of Strange Swirling Lights.](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Dimension_of_Strange_Swirling_Lights)

**Evidence 1**

This setting or place was described in the [Broly Anime Comic](https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Super-Broly-Theatrical-Comics/dp/4088820029) as [super-dimensional](https://ibb.co/r4H1SMP) [several](https://ibb.co/BGwbrGW) different [times.](https://ibb.co/5xWL6x7) The kanji used here refers to a [higher dimensional spaces](https://ibb.co/7rqGNcB) ([spaces with extra dimensional axes](https://ibb.co/922fhjj)).

#Interview 


The production and animation team for the Broly movie [was interviewed on the film's special effects](https://dragonball.news/news/dbmfl28.html) under an article from the official Dragon Ball Website. Here, it was stated that the team's purpose was to create [a super-dimensional images](https://ibb.co/GcQd203) with the use of CGI **Again the swirling lights is referred to as a super dimension which in this case likely means a higher dimension**


[It was stated that under the process of CGI,](https://ibb.co/v3ZwQTH) Typically, a reference image of a natural setting like a wilderness or the sea is used to create 3-dimensional imagery. However, this time, the modelers used mathematical formulas to create a space based on elements that do not exist in reality, as if it were from a different dimension. 

The kanji used for 'different dimension' in the article is [異空間], which directly translates to 'different space' and seems to refer to an external space with different laws. One common interpretation of [異空間] [is that it refers to higher-dimensional spaces which in this case is very likely due to the Swirling Lights being called and referred too as “Super Dimension”](https://ibb.co/Q8R12NV)


Later on however, they said that to portray this space in a 3 Dimensional format, [they expressed different dimensions using mathematical formulas as a model.](https://ibb.co/YhjSJ0H) Different dimension(s) \[異次元\] in the context of science and sci-fi refers to [worlds with dimensions distinct/different from the ordinary](https://ibb.co/MRZwyHC); [an idea that encompasses both a fantasy concept of alternate worlds and mathematical concepts of dimensions to denote a world that occupies a higher dimension](https://ibb.co/XJHbW9d).

They stated the Dimension of Swirling Lights couldn't be constructed with standard 3-D modeling, so they had to generate its environment by expressing the dimension(s) as mathematical formulas that you wouldn't expect humans to comprehend. This loaded statement seems to carry heavy connotations as far as higher mathematical dimensions go. For instance, with tesseracts (which represent higher dimensional space), their volume is [based on mathematical formulas,](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/four_dimensions/index.html) humans [can't generally](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/217101) comprehend [such expressions,](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2287777) and modeling them visually [is considered the equivalent of modeling abstruse mathematics in the third dimension.](https://www.instructables.com/3d-4-Dimensional-Tesseract-Hypercube-Model-A-TJT3/) Not to mention, the first research link I provided explained ""super-dimensional imagery"" as something 3-dimensional portrayed in 2-dimensional imaging space while the second one explained ""super-dimensional reconstruction"" as creating 3-dimensional structures from 2-dimensional reference images: thus My Conclusion is that the dimension shown from the Broly movie were higher dimensional spaces that the movie production team aimed to portray in the 3D format using CGI.


#Where is the Dimension of Swirling Lights located?

It was stated that this dimension was reached by [distorting space-time](https://vsbattles.com/threads/official-translation-requests-thread-new-forum.107531/post-5704252), [breaching the limits of the universe](https://imgur.com/a/6yiKCol), [Tearing dimensional walls apart](https://twitter.com/Herms98/status/1453172630983348227?s=20), [then ""disintegrating"" the dimension to leave it](https://imgur.com/a/6yiKCol). [Their power was stated to be too much for the universe to handle.](https://imgur.com/a/SkIvbOM) In Dragon Ball, ""the universe"" [refers to the living world](https://vsbattles.com/threads/dragon-ball-cosmology-minor-revision.153563/) more often than the macrocosm as a whole. It would definitely make more sense if the Dimension of Swirling Lights encompassed the living world \[or at bare minimum, is an adjacent space-time\] since breaking the living world's space-time fabric leads directly to it and back from it **Could be argued for 6D**

#Where would this scale to?


**However since the size of this dimension is not explicitly specified this dimension would fall into the insignificant 5-D / 6-D but since it is referred to as a dimension / realm it should have its own space and time continuum Time Captures an uncountable amount of moments**

**Temporal Axes act as infinitesimal snapshots of the Spatial Nature of a Universe at any given point, the sum of which comprises the Totality of Space-Time. As such, they are always significant as it pertains to Tiering. The existence of Time in the Swirling Light’s dimension would Mathematically be exhibited as (R\*R\*R\*R)\*R or R\^5, significantly 5-Dimensional. With all of this laid out, Dragon Ball’s Swirling Lights Dimension should by all means qualify for Low 1-C or a significant 5th dimension**

 
#Conclusion

General Theory of relativity describes The Universe containing 3 Spatial Dimensions with 1 Temporal/Time Dimension. However, since we know the Dimension of Swirling Lights was intended to be a higher dimensional space beyond the living world, this would make the macrocosm consist of at least 4 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time: making universe 7 likely 5-D



#Multiverse Section


#Neutral Void/Insignificant 6D

**Description**

*Neutral Void - A space that holds all 12 Universes in dragon ball super in parallel pairs the tournament between Universe 7 and 6 is held in a nameless planet that lies within a void called a neutral space*

**First I will explain the current explanation for the neutral void**

Imagine two parallel lines

For two parallel lines to be displaced in such a way that no matter how much you extend its sides it will still stay parallel the environment or space they are in must be  3-D same goes with the neutral space holding parallel 4D macrocosm the neutral space must be a 5-D

#First Evidence

[First Image when super shenron was summoned the view zooms out revealing celestial bodies but no universe 7 nor 6 can even be seen in the distance implying that it may possibly dwarf both infinite size macrocosm](https://imgur.com/a/D6MgEbS)

#Second Evidence


**This is the most important scan**

[Many of you all know that dragon ball super uses circle structure containing the Universes as a way to represent them during the super shenron summoning the view zooms out revealing Universe 6 further in the distance the neutral void is still there meaning it encompasses both universe and possibly all 12 universes](https://imgur.com/a/X3iXY6h) this also means it dwarfs all 12 Universes which literally qualifies for significance 

[Macrocosm are represented as a galaxy like structure contained in a ball](https://imgur.com/a/SaPrq3W)



#Evidence 3

[The view zooms out again yet no universe can be seen](https://imgur.com/a/3yyRkkc)

In vsbw for a higher dimensional structure to be considered significant it must have a showing of qualitative superiority over lower dimensions such as embedding lower dimensional spaces or dwarfing an infinite size lower dimensional structure 



#Argument 1

The Neutral Void is shown encompassing both Universe 6 and 7 with both of them being infinite in size which qualifies for significance



#Argument  2

Both universe 7 and 6 are shown to not be visible to the main cast which implies that the neutral void dwarfs all 12 Universes this means it dwarfs all 12 Universes which again qualifies as significant 


#Argument 3

The neutral void is its own dimension and is another space and time continuum time captures an uncountable amount of moments which would capture an uncountable amount of the neutral void making it significant this is supported by hit someone who is able to manipulate time being able to manipulate time in the neutral space 

Which mean that time exists in it since time can be divided infinitely between decimals and time is infinitely long this would mean that the Neutral Void is in fact a significant 5-D space 

#Conclusion 

The neutral void is undeniably a significant 5-D

**Since each Macrocosm are at least 5D this would make the neutral void 6D**



#Zeno’s realm

-Not much known about it but what we know so far is that it any interaction with the representation of the living matter of the universe also affects reality itself and it also beyond even the neutral void which contains all 12 Infinite Size Macrocosms 

which can qualify for bulk space which can mean the zeno realm is higher dimension but we cannot say this for certain so it is just another Space and Time continuum but if you want to high ball it then it would 7D





#Timeline Section

#Hypertimelines

I am not knowledgeable about hypertimlines But i will try my best to explain it but feel free to correct me if i am wrong

Imagine space-time as a series of movie frames aligned under an extensive line. We could think of these frames as ""snapshots:"" static representations of the cosmos at a given time. Meanwhile, this line we call time extends infinitely to encompass the past, present, and future. Time is a continuum: a continuous parameter. This means it isn't measured in discrete values. So not only does a timeline encompass infinite seconds, days, and years, but it contains every infinitesimal value in between. This is why Vs Wiki's explanation noted that a standard timeline is the equivalent of uncountably infinite snapshots of 3-dimensional volume. Time can be infinitely subdivided into infinitesimally small moments, each corresponding to a unique snapshot of the universe, culminating in a scope that can't be represented by an infinite set of real numbers.
If you've ever wondered why destroying the fabric of space-time is considered infinitely greater than destroying matter on a universal scale (3-A<low 2-C), that's why. A timeline contains snapshots for the past, present, and future, and destroying one is like destroying a universe uncountably infinitely many times over. Going back to the bolded question above, a timeline's uncountable infinity isn't determined by the space under it, but the number of snapshots it holds. It's the same reason time is considered the 4th dimension and a higher infinity whether the universe it defines is finite or infinite.

**So with the Neutral Void being 6D this would scale a single hypertimeline to 7D-8D depending if you accept that the zeno realm is also a higher dimension**



#Another Space dimension 

Next is the space between timelines, as we already know, we see the space between timelines that trunks uses to travel between them, it’s depicted in a model in the dbs manga, and [its depicted in the anime as a brown space, and there’s also a depiction of it in the dbz kai anime. It depicts that the timelines are obviously parallel to each other,](https://imgur.com/a/va2Hmy6 )and as we know, for parallel timelines to be held in the same space, that space must be higher dimensional. So this means that this space between timelines is **8D**. Which is still not the absolute limit of the entire dragon ball cosmology




#MANY WOLRD INTERPRETATIONS

https://imgur.com/a/c7pn3J8

ENGLISH TRANSLATION 
The future of the world was saved because Goku and Gohan defeated Cell, but in the future in which Trunks lived, it is he who defeats Cell. In other words, the fact that Goku was cured of the fatal disease created at least two different futures, just as there is a future in which Trunks is killed by Cell. A small detail altered in the past can create countless parallel worlds.

Another Evidence 

https://imgur.com/a/hO06naf
By the way, Shin himself has a time ring, which further confirms that there are other parallel worlds in Universe 7


another one here

https://imgur.com/a/tLEWtBa
It is said that all Kaioshins have their own rings, refuting the fact that there are only 5 timelines, but there are several other parallel worlds in the 12 Universes.

Launched in Japan in 2003 by Shueisha and in Brazil by Conrad in 2005, the Dragon Ball Z Encyclopedia


The website itself mentions that Kaioshin are capable of going to parallel worlds in their Universes

https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_1877.html
He kills his former master, Supreme Kai Gowasu, and steals his Ring of Time, a tool that allows the Supreme Kais to travel between parallel timelines. He discovers Future Trunks' timeline where the Supreme Kai and God of Destruction had already passed away and heads there to destroy it, thereby becoming its one and only god.

https://imgur.com/a/PuGtCtf
Well... For those who don't know, there is a room full of time rings only in Universe 10

https://imgur.com/a/w2cZaE1
Shin mentions that he has traveled to several parallel worlds, multiple times, which means that it was not just 5 parallel worlds, but several of them.

Those time rings are only for Universe 10, where he travels through the future to their respective Universes

Yes, there is solid evidence that the work works with MWI, the website itself mentions it, talking about time travel


**Parallel Worlds and Time Paradoxes**


https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_708.html

ow that we've all hopefully got at least a vague understanding of how time machines could work, I decided to ask about parallel worlds and time paradoxes. Time paradoxes occur when some kind of contradiction or loop is created due to your travels to and from the past and future, and in order to enable time travel, we'd have to find a way to resolve them.Even within Dragon Ball, Trunks altered his universe's history slightly by going back to the past to discover the Androids' weakness. It's this process that gives rise to multiple futures, i.e., parallel worlds.

https://imgur.com/a/XaCyyva

Being a crime does not guarantee you to refute MWI, especially because parallel worlds are created by smaller things, with thousands of them existing through simple time travel.


Furthermore, in the anime itself it is shown that there are other parallel worlds besides those mentioned in Universe 10

https://imgur.com/a/iVj86tS#LtK9rLN

Not only that, but the following is said on the official Dragon Ball website

https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_2350.html

Three years pass, and Androids 19 and 20 attack South City. Once again Trunks returns from the future, but the Androids that attacked South City are not the Androids that Trunks knows. One small change in history can cause many possible futures, so it seems that the past that Trunks arrived in was not the past he knew.

**All of this is supported by the fact that GT and Daima are canon**




#GT IS CANON TO DRAGON 

[Akira toriyama the author of Dragon ball has stated that he considers GT as an alternate history of the original dragon ball series](https://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/dragon-book-gt-toriyama-intro/ ) questioning their status. However, Toei Animation (the animation studio behind the entire franchise) and Shueisha (the publisher behind the manga) recognized 'GT' as an official part of the canon in the timelines presented at the screenings.

In 1993, Akira Toriyama entrusted Takao Koyama with the new story of the little robot and for the designs he chooses Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru (creator of SS4). That manga is titled ""The Return Of Dr. Slump"" and is the official continuation of the story that ended in 1984. (Which means Arale is canon to Dragon ball)

Akira toriyama made many contributions to GT, every interview here

#Conclusion DBS has the many worlds interpretations 






**Extra Information Alternate Dimensions**


* It’s shown to be [Impossible to travel to the Afterlife](https://imgur.com/a/C794Se4 )without special methods. 


* Also, travel to the Kaioshin realm is not possible [Without Teleportation](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/b/be/1071594612575174787-1073090053066195004-image0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230803131657 )


* The Universe/Universe 7 and Afterlife are stated to be [Seperated from space and time](https://streamable.com/cniakr )Uses Jiku which refers to 4D Space-Time). The 2 realms are also infinite in size qualifying too.


* The Sugoroku Space is a space
* [between The afterlife and the living world](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/9/9d/1049176589964935218-1093662136867225721-IMG-4952.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230804081019)


* Also, although it doesn’t prove separation of space-times alone different time flow can be supporting evidence.

[More proof for the seperation between the afterlife and the living world](https://imgur.com/a/pZtdn9i)

[The Living world or Human World is referred to as a lower temporal dimension The episode is 266 this means that the afterlife has a higher dimensional axis](https://imgur.com/a/living-universe-is-stated-to-be-lower-realm-temporal-world-4IIHZth)

* The RoSaT is stated to have a [Different Time dimension](https://imgur.com/a/room-of-spirit-time-has-different-time-dimension-dPoCXaT)

* comparitive to realms like the Kaioshin Realm and Living World, which means their spatio-temporal separation involves distinct time dimensions.
* There is a room inside the Living World that creates [space and time](https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:ProfectusInfinity/Time_Room_%26_Dragon_Ball_Cosmology )confirming that it’s serviced by its own time dimension

* Subspace (a Space That Lacks No Concept Of space Or Time)[https://imgur.com/a/dragon-ball-subspace-W3ZhG3g] 

That is all I think this should be enough to prove that the DBS Cosmology scales much much higher than just 5D 

Just msg me if I missed something 

**In conclusion the entire DBS cosmology scales to at least to infinite 8D-9D**


#Dragon ball Super Heroes Cosmology


There are about 3 Uncountable Infinite sets of timeline which adds +2D so 9D-10D
https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerScaling/comments/1eyy86h/comment/lji9itv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

know, the Crack of Time is a [Realm beyond time](https://imgur.com/a/yO40HF1 ) and exists beyond history, as Demigra was going to hide there after destroying history. It is separate yet interconnected with all dimensions (timelines) and houses [Entire Timelines in the form of crystals](https://youtu.be/sAyz74ioVkg?si=-fOhrLr1pBUUhydS)

With this in mind, the very obvious low end here would be a dimension above the multiverse, which, in its totality would be roughly 9-D-10D, making the Crack of Time 10th-Dimensional.

However, there is another way to look at this. Particularly, this scan here. Now, the reason I'm bringing attention to this is because of the Kanji used, and with that, I think now is the time to address a certain topic within the community...Translations.
As you may be aware of by now, there is currently a discussion revolving around the words (and kanji) of 超次元 (Chou Jigen), and 高次元 (Ko Jigen).

Now, while it is true that Ko Jigen is meant to be ""Higher Dimensions"" Cho Jigen is actually a little different and can have multiple different translations depending on the specific Kanji used.

As an example the kanji used in the Crack of Time scan is clearly not Cho Jigen, it uses different Kanji, and as such has a different meaning, it even uses the specific Kanji for time, further showing the differences in meaning. Similarly, this scan for Broly is different to both of the other kanji shown. Point is, we can't just say it's super dimensional and leave it at that, we have to dive deeper into the specific translations and what they mean.
So, what does the Crack of Time scan translate to? Well given that it has the Kanji for time, I ran it through multiple translators, and the most consistent answer was that of Superspace, this is further backed up in [this translation](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/913483582587142145/968895154696105984/Screenshot_2022-04-27-17-23-08-739_com.reddit.frontpage.jpg?width=283&height=612)
What does this mean? Well, a Super space is considered to have infinite dimensions, and all possible spaces. As well as this, Super space is also a form of [Super symmetry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspace ) and [super geometry](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/superspace ) The most common use for Super space is that of Super Space-Time, which is actually the more literal translation of the scan. Super Space-Times use Sigma Models, which in this sense consist of [Infinite dimensions](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/extended+super+Minkowski+spacetime )Admittedly, there is some conflicting information as to whether or not Super-Space would be Infinite dimensional, so I'll include both ends of the scaling in this blog. Just note that, from my research, the most consistent interpretation is that it would contain Infinite dimensions. At bare minimum, it transcends the Multiverse, and Time Nest, which would make it 10-D to 11D
Conclusion: Crack of Time is At Least High 1-C (10-D / 11D) Likely High 1-B (Infinite-D)
Beat's World:

Okay, we just got done with a very controversial and complicated topic, so thankfully this one is very cut and dry. Beats world completely transcends the DBH Multiverse including the Crack of Time. We see this through the fact that it is seen as impossible for the DBH characters to be in the world, and Demigra is stated to have needed to ""transcend space"" in order to reach it.
Conclusion: Beats World should be At Least High 1-C (11-D / 12-D) Likely 1-A (Beyond Dimensionality/Outerversal)

The Charisma world is also rather simple, it is a world where the avatars of the producers promote DBH and are completely transcendent to it.
Conclusion: Charisma World is At Least 1-B (12-D / 13D)Likely High 1-A (Baseline High Outer)

“The True Real World”

""Real World"" is yet another fictional transcendence as it includes Tori-Bot, [who is stated to be the reason why all of DBH exist which should logically include the charisma world As well as this, a promoter states how he is contractility obligated to enter the charisma world and they even flat out show a physical copy of shonen jump](https://imgur.com/a/dbh-real-world-people-credit-to-zenkai-8ASY2nC)

Conclusion: The ""Real World"" is at least 1-B (13-D / 14-D) Likely High 1-A (1 layer into High Outer)

Eternal Glome,PoetryWritingClub,1i8vt7i,2025-01-24 08:50:29,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1i8vt7i/eternal_glome/,The_Silencer__,,"This poem is Internal Gloom.
Scotch with the zone I glone. 
Ripples of what will never be entrapped in the tomb of an External Glome. 

Curved arrows pointing to directions of the same things.
I bi-pass and pedal on the canvas of linear actuality. 

Forced to curve.
Innately confined to escape a casualty.
Perpendicularly to the instance the impulse caps the track of thee. 

Tedious reaction leaving slumber as the moon swings streams, and finds time to meet back on the other side. 

Confabulation with entities.
Unique depictions of interest as I take snapshots of its outer-scope I chose. 

Enclosing an interpretative dose of the same dreams.
A strange glimpse of what hides congruent. 

I coast through time, and loop around the cycles of limitations.

Linking entropy, I chain ink to give life to the points that can’t express without its movement.

Without a page, it’s the same phase.
Letters appear drifting, lifting to conscience.
I leave an eye to peer into the mind of the receiver, and analyze to Light the Stage. 

Mind ablaze. 
Rays wage the plays to channel on.
Prongs of interference dismissed as an innate gauge. 

Infinitesimally undetected insights.
Omnipresent, dribbles what is not to see untapped in its external age.

As Time finds time this time to find Fallacy I trap Capacity, circumscribed by Time in the same cage as Infinity.

Life’s gift is a trillion seconds at most to endure naturally.
At the cusp of a blastocyst, experience has a battery.

Manipulation of Physics as an ability.
Physically held by its characteristics.
DNA…extending rights to this reality.
Birth, survival, preservation, progression, and computation to all force along.

An asymptote to what has happened, and what one will watch in a unique set of membranes temporary to own. 

Impacted in the structure of my INTJ rage I Blaze the Stage, a tone switch. 

A different pitch of levels as I meddle interaction’s contractions with passion, and sheer existence to interfere.
Outer-body searching for what regards as inner fears, and never found it or knew it. 

One posed to persist to be one; I seen through, but on another note I heard at most that was a ghost.

I throw endeavors in a ditch.
Conclude the things that have a hint to peddle with what is evident. 
It’s settled, and was a fun run.

Introspection whispers “inner’s- here”.
I intercept with, “Silence…let Fear speak”.
Now silence at its peak. 

Counted sheep in slumber in a Googolplex magnitude of black ones.
In a bleak domain with an atmosphere of impenetrable black dust. 
Without a rush successfully before I was ejected, and fell to sleep with eyes opened counting none. 

With no conveyance of being perplexed or in disarray; 
reality is what I decide and order.
Then ask the “pen” how was that for a flex?
What’s next isn’t a test of my center of complexity. 

Inserted a fourth-wall before the peer at the other three. 
Have room to enter and store the teem of animals.
Aligned them with their natural numbers plus one.
Named this one “forever more” all contrived from imaginative lnk.

Could have done it with altitude from the standpoint of my aptitude, but on either axis combined is shorter than a planck-length.

Far from its entirety.

I’m suspected to be the host of the inner-body within an interlude passing through society detecting what will ensue. 

Intrude upon some notions of strong forces, but conceptually are meek due to proof being undetected. 

The world won’t reveal a secret of deepness in life’s platitudes of a blueprint though far, the star keeps me in the loop.
Must have been a powerful thump.
Or if in God’s hands at some point, it threw it. 

Almost everything rouge not every intention feasible.
A plain of ultimate goals.
Some unreachable.
Apparently incalculable and extraneously inconceivable.
Until it’s married with dynamic model’s conjunctions of new and old.
That will entail if perception will be the same.

Have the merit intact, compact and slip encryption esoterically.
Enclosing odds in the holes that pretends things to fall in wherever one didn’t know it would go. 

I paint the Stage and its walls with chains.
In this dimension anything connecting this field, is the function’s game to be played forever.

Then let it exist. 
This is another zone a switch of a phase.
Transform the Stage into charades.
Closed my eyes to see.
Imagined it all already, and can tune the sharpness. 

With darkness even I have sight, and my motion still governable. 
Journey planned, completed, and the wind has the same swings. 
In one night, I have more dreams than atoms combined in my sheets and covers keeping the same being comfortable. 
I have only mentioned my daydream after my night dream.
The cycling has looped around, and the moon appears to be rolling over.

Decided to create an epic poem with each page separated.
Designed being inscribed in an indestructible, tall deck of cards. 
Each card was a “page” to engage and you can shuffle it.
And read them all in any order with a unique story coherently.
Accounted for all possibilities of all factors, chronologically.

Thought to publish it, but for comedy adventures decided to spread them all equally out into the world. 
If a person embarks to collect to read, then I’ll meet to talk about the epic experience of one’s Odyssey to obtain it. 
Then take a sip of the Scotch sit back, and let it all unfurl.

Curl everything in…and let it burst.
The curse is using it sagaciously it doesn’t come with other servings. 
Or survive by a massive star to jar some things that you want to take from its death. 

Or realistically don’t survive, and hide to the point where the answer renders too much light to process.
At a time that in time’s scope all life, and all life-span is just a band of light and elements in a palindromic dorm.
None of it at that reference of time left.

Took a visit to the outer zone to pull its cheeks, and suffered a massive blast of neutrinos right back at me.
I wonder if its ongoing swarm goes unnoticed. 
Everything that comes in goes out in whatever shape or form.
The only difference is the increments of time. 
Thus in a cosmic note of temporary experience, we are the ghost.
An uncovered concept to witness, dispute, or cope. 

Some days, I lock down a couple of senses to conduct a day to make sure the active ones are trained and mastered on terrains in extremely difficult conditions. 

Decide to do this exercise in trade of information slipping away all for the sensation. 
Realized the lack of efficiency of that comes natural regardless of the aids of communicative translations. 

To enclosed the cracks, my patience relaxed. 
Created a device that can see worth in everything. 

Was quickly taken back when I sit an object on the Stage. 
Checked to see attraction of movement of worth inside the object, and the entities were playing jumping jacks. 

I guess uncertainty, plays offense and defense. 
I know for certain, that it’s all apart of sequence. 
Hackers playing chess and trail and error on many defenses. 

Viruses bored of only nature, and found its own technology to release in. 
The consequences of being in a con’s sequences of a day and age.

A limit in time. 

We move forward, and can use a tool where it can be given a direction.
Circle around back to my options, and press a square logically.

Force itself that it, and a circle is the same thing. 
One may think non-topologically that’s nonsense, but my senses show improvement a nice amalgamation. 

One not to trust the one that treats one eyes like starlight.
Though starlight in their eyes to peer at others can be a glimpse of admiration. 

Indications of the deep.
Humans scared at my birth because my first words were “It repeats.”
Heard a conversation about souls, and I mistook it as soles at the age of 2.
Told them “Over there, underneath.” 

One night I walked along opened space on a dark street. 
Lurking around the corner appears the disposition of a dark figure. 
Figured that this would be some type of abstract invasion. 

It told me, “You knew that this time would come.”

I interjected with “actually”. 
I only trapped Infinity in my Capacity.
I know that may have took Time,
but knowing when a time will come can be calculated from an equation. 

Not the events during any time interval of the future, and Time found you. 
I don’t have time for you at least not a lot, Fallacy.

“Your time is up. Your highest level of Logic and Philosophy can’t escape.”

Then let it exist.
I’ll play your game it would be easy to in general.
You regularly function in the population, and using my highest level as a bar of inability is a mere quantum smell on the play of your Psychology. 

Strategically, your system of conclusion is an illusion a formal system of thoughts
and nodes.
All made up of an inevitable Paradox verses cells and a brain. 

Since you are an entity too, then let’s confabulate on a Dark Stage.
Perhaps it’s time to paint a hellish scene of shadows with no existence of light in the abyss. 

In peak thoughts when humans mention of their deep thoughts, I sit at a bottom the plethora. 

From my reference point, I’m seeing the stars of their deepest wishes passing by, and anytime I can decide to make a wish on that. 

From a lower room in their mind of frigid climate that’s deeper than the endeavors that I ditched in my own reality. 

Creep in this abyss, and drink from a deep well of rumination.

Consume all the incomplete thoughts that leak in the closed door of a room with complete silence.  

Hide all of their fears in here with me if it’s never found, then at least one still has fear of the unknown.

This is an Eternal Glome.
Explore the lands of the logical logorrhea. 

Exponential cognitively, but physically perceived as a Base Rate…
Fallacy is already on the roll. 

Cognitively assemble illogically, and meet Division fallacy due to possible mutations of Genetic fallacy. 

Appeal to Novelty can show up even in the dimension of formulated idea.
New spark of attention. 
Chronological Snobbery. 

Failed to reverse-engineer it’s getting Ecological.
Would contradict itself at this point if it gets Etymological, not to forget the same “fail” of Association in its deeds. 

One can have a notion that you know nothing.
Then when you prove something respond that it doesn’t count any amount, and other factors are the new goal. 

I put on a mask, and weave freely with no thoughts of correction to The_Silencer_00, ever uncovered. 

During a supper.
I created an event then another event, and collected conclusions from others.
Looked at what existed without the proper data to reach that. 
Then handed them back, what was imagined. 

During another event of festivities, I met a human that told me perception was reality. 
Then recognized based on context there’s multiple perceptions, and simply one reality. 

I don’t talk much through pensive thoughts, and refuse to think to Mind Project subjectivity. 
Still enjoying my glass of Scotch with ice. 
Think one has a hot hand okay, then reroll the dice.

It’s time to see what it’s not. 
Drunk some filtered water then passed out faking it.
Checking if someone will say that the water was dangerous.
I’m mean to a Post-hoc until bewilderment is vaporous. 

Dig up Fallacy, and uncover it to check what’s really evident. 
Destroying an Exception through Overwhelming Exception that’s present. 

One can choose Misleading Vividness in trade for mere relevance.
One reads it all on a computer, and we can see it in one’s assessment with a subjective hint pulling the rug from right under it.

A bluff of perspicacity. 
Have friends that are almost nothing alike that I’ve been around in public.
If same race and gender, then comments exposing assumptions of us to be the same type of people, Faulty Analogy.

An unlikely remark of preference: 
An English teacher substituting a detention room graded the math test.
If he/she knew enough to grade it, then a grade is a grade. 
But if not, then Ergo Decedo’s done its part. 

Address a Bailey quickly, and throw a dart at the pending Motte to address more extensively.
Request a reference for only one Definition to Retreat to. 

Locked Ambiguity and Equivocation out before they rush in to circle their reasons up into a continuum of Incomplete Comparisons, and it won’t stop due to Appeal to Tradition quite easy to see to.  

Some people are controlled by feedback without a question of its intention.

Then when it’s too late the prop’s up it escalates, and can’t understand the gravity within it.
The gravitational influence of being captured by a gimmick. 

Some try to combine Furtive with Appeal to Motive, then attempt to end it swiftly.
Begging the Question to then heighten it with Affirmative Conclusions from a Negative Premise. 

Illogical grounds I’ve seen one take two Correlations then Assume a Cause. 
Then use Reverse Causation to loop it back around acting as if that itself was logically sound.

Tall tales and a fable. 
I’ve have asked Fallacy for a denotation, then given a Loaded Label. 
Affecting not only populations, but nations. Analogous to how Magical Thinking pretends to work with obviously Casual Oversimplifications.

Fallacy, what a disgrace. 
One taking pride on hard-earned lucky result, then don’t understand the multiple ways that it could have been the case. 
I’m glad you materialized to request an eye-to-eye. 

False Guru’s Inflation of Conflict while Quoting out of Context, and heard monologues that bled of Reification that they are sure to deny. 

Even when associating with a person and drinking, my position isn’t By Whiskey.
I have a clear side. 

Let’s visit or do something fun in a town today.
How about I decide to go on a fun ride. 
Someone was disrespected at the entrance of an amusement park, and now hate them all. 
Claimed a ruined day.
Walked, then rolled away. 

What an entertaining bait, Hasty Generalization.
I suppose we “coast” differently.
Then eventually get on a rollercoaster to loop around to the other side. 

Special Pleads wrapped up by False Dilemmas translated in the context of a Loaded Question tided to the mentality of a Taxes Sharpshooter.

That only drew a “Suppressed Correlative” in a wild pursuit to Appeal to Nature. 
All to Appeal to Consequences an interesting composition. 
Affirming a Disjunct, we are bound to meet no Middle Ground. 

I’ll pick one off discreetly, immediately in a situation. 
Raise a voice with a sentence on propose in a particular tone to see who will raise a badge of a Tone Police, and Fallacy a point is loss. 
Manipulation of the outcome without changing anything that I really said. 

Retrospective Determinism as an expense of deductions lost.
Though wrong many times, perhaps the feeling of being right is the reason of the Sink Cost. 

If one Appeals to Authority or Accomplishment I’ll reply,
 “Well I just came from space and met some aliens that accomplished what you’ve never known”. 

Stare at them while their mind processes that, then hear a response with a composition that Appeals to Stone. 

After that trick, I’ll accuse them of Personal Incredulity. 
Then tell them that they could have believed me if they chose to Appeal to Ignorance instead. 

Later to demonstrate Capacity, and its gates without its Limits cupped. 

Simulate reality outside of a box that’s bigger than someone, then watch them call 5 people to come to pick up a box that’s empty.

After finding out that it’s lightweight, I’ll put a much smaller box right beside the other box.
Watch one person try to pick it up oneself.
Only after assessing weight, one realized two others may be needed to pick the smaller box up. 

Next time I’ll do it with a ball, and define another game that I don’t know what to call.
Decided to keep its denotation loose, and reduced it to a separation of clear aims. 

Catch one Red-Handed in attempts or remarks that veer from a claim. 
Some claim me to be Emotionless because they can’t Appeal to mine. 
Then we dive right into the Burden of Proof. 

I might sit them on Bandwagon on top of a frictionless plate with the Ruler, and place them on a slight edge while on top of a Slippery Slope to see how many Straw-Mans that they can dodge from all the ones that they ever formulated and produced. 

After that, eject Fallacy right off the bandwagon of Prevalent Proof. 

Someone may have to use silence wisely to not “Prove too Much”. 
Some others treat one’s silence or lack of response as evidence acting if “silence speaks”, and told it all. 

Analyze the land before me. 
Trivial Objections as if an existence of a response has kept its momentum to the claim against it. 
Once thought as safe, only to formulate a Kettle-Story. 
Shall I ever forget…the world is complex in the context inclosed in what is predisposed to be presupposed. 

Try to address some other people with direct things, and a statement about something unrelated could be the response to oppose it. 
Not surprise that it is a bunch of this.

I could surmise that Fallacy dislikes this game.
Ashamed for it because this time it’s not a Homunculus. 

Proof by Assertion has much effect on the youth…from a standpoint of Affirming the Consequent. 
Relating that, I detect something relativistic. 
Vexed on a random day when I make a remark, and meet Ignoratio Elenchi.

Preceding after that, a Psychologist fallacy.
If that wasn’t enough, then conclude it all with a thought Terminating Cliche. 
The rest of my time, I remain quiet. 
Mentally shaking my head at everything caught that was Anecdotal mixed in with Moralistic. 

Some notions easy to refute is a nice fine process of Cherries Picked, and is like a Nirvana itself. 
Yet, a spacious room for Vacuous Truth combined with things unrealistic.

What else is there to store to add to the mix.
Regression Fallacy of one that thought that it could knock some sense into an object, and have it fixed. 
Later on witnessed the same person throwing it around as an attempt to fix it more, a comical sight.

Or one can think like a gambler on a lucky night: 
“If I take this test and answer it, perhaps I will randomly get one right. 
And if that happens, hopefully that one right will provide a streak, and the other ones will start to be more right too”, then turn in it. 

Learned some physical laws while putting check marks on whatever is a False Cause. 
Predictions locked in a prism, and already seen by many eyes. 

Used a profile pic that’s not me of a random color, and get a neutral or positive response.
Change it to myself, and get Courtier’s Replies.
Then I laugh at the possible Bulverism. 

When I’m bored of what to do, I pull out a Bong that has powers and constant feats of winning. 
If I tell it to fetch, then it can easily catch a Tu Quoque in nanoseconds at its beginning.

Trap it right in its dominion. 
Then pour water inside let’s see it float on a boat of its deception, and watch everything in the closed system turn in to vapor. 

Was told to add Two Wrongs on a sheet of paper, and turned in it blank.
Fallacy wrote “a Right”, and gave it back to me. 
(Sure, “a Right”…Entitlement of Opinion). 

I won’t provoke, disappear a False Equivalence.
Used one of the pet pen’s powers to cast a spell on its resilience. 

Keep a clear sheer away from false truths, and avoidance to the ever-persistent “No True Scotsman”. 
Fill the Stage up with Water, and put Fallacy and Paradox in the same tank as cousins of the same existence. 

Fallacy why the silence. 
Claim the conclusion that Fallacy itself is a Virus. 
Fallacy now gains the courage to claim,
“Haha you have now lost The_Silencer_00. You have now loss to a Fallacy”. 

I explained to Fallacy that it needs a host to spew from, and fallacious thoughts really have real effects on reality.
Thus you got bored biologically, technologically, and live in your perfect matrix in the realm of “abstraction”.

You’re trapped now.
Thanks for the invasion courtesy of Time’s wish if you might forget. 
Fallacy you have almost reached your maximum “allotted” time. 

It went from on roll to defeated, and trolled by circumscribing it in “Fallacy, fallacy”. 
Fallacy how about we switch the game, and call it “A Paradox how?”
…and see what I don’t let exist. 

Casted Fallacy away to attempt to do a Lump of Labor in a complex business world. 
Checked the context of a Paradox, and summoned myself to a pervasive one.
A Grandfather saw me walking up and panicked. 
Handed it the Second and Third law of Thermodynamics. 

Here’s a Heap of information. 
Then it asked me “What is a Heap?”
I stated, no need to be persuasive.
Whoever is inclined can decide “when something’s a heap” whenever they decide. 
It’s time to leave.

I’m dismissed don’t forget this time, but one can try to reverse time unlocking the door. 
Leap a question at me about what it is worth some time, and my response to it will be why bother. 

Feeling refreshed as I left the temple. 
Paradox attempted to loop back summoned itself as Hemple. 
Escaped Unexpected Examination by creation of two time banks.

One is allotted time right before the first time of the possible test. 
The rest in a bubble of possibilities of more time that may be there, but not determined yet. 
Prepare the best for the first day of the first time of the possible test.
If there take the test. 
If not there, then a new set of time conveyed in the constraints of the lapse of time before the time and day that’s possibly the day of the test. 

Hemple in front of me.
It told me “All ravens are Black”. 
Examination expected. 
I reply a dubious,
“Is that so? I wonder the equation as I comprehend what you said.
I wonder of others.”
While my cream-colored pet raven flew right over its head, and might even signal it to circle back. 

Checking this time to see if one will conceive it. 
A long time ago discovered the nature of truth:
“This statement is false”
Statements are to access and conclude, then to decide if one will truly believe it. 

Yet usually only utilize and realize this when receiver stumbles upon statement that one automatically won’t believe in or inconceivable. Fundamentally a meter of conscious, and subconscious calculations of what’s reasonable. 
An endless stream of notions to contest what is or is not believable. 

Physics in its reality. 
Dichotomy Paradox, Not.
Mathematics can provide proofs for reality, but one must distinguish the difference of when it’s real equations or abstract in its confines. 

Perfection has nothing to do with Murder.
70% verse 100% efficiency of two crimes. 
If both get away, then they have both crossed the line of the same outcome regardless of the tactics or the crumbles of detection. 

Dipped off to dive in the near body water to take a dip in.
Baited by an illusionary encounter of Theseus ship, and it won’t be forsaken. 
I stated,
“Nice to see that it survived all of the trips. It’s amazing to see this ship’s over-time transformation.”

Paradox asked me “What about the other ship?”
I said:
“Get a grip, on the situation. 
Add some adhesives, and go create another ship of old parts that was once used for another ship. 

Even if you take a trip on that ‘ship’, you can still trip on the newly built ship of that ship sharing the first ship’s stream of continuity that can’t divide since old parts were linked to other’s initial experience of the same function.”
Then leave the scene as I drip off.  

“Hey Paradox, next time you see Fallacy ask him did he find the Lump.”
Now Paradox even feels trumped, and is ticked off. 

I request to concede.
Paradox is pissed off. 
Threatened to have my near future attacked from a start of a Self-replicating Machine, and before I know it will be 10,000 more. 

My last response was,
“Hope you dream with 100% efficiency, and please exceed to reach that glory or a Shor Algorithm. 
I am surely safe, but cool story. 
For now, I’ll await for that on a later time”, and left the shore. 

Disappeared like a spider’s web in the wind. 
Left Paradox a letter discussing its capacities that stated,

“Bring that up again before me in life, and we may have to catch an elephant in the room. 
The sources of those batteries. 
Not to impede, but I’m intrigued what will the answer be…only rhetorically. 
Does the machine replicate what it wishes to be, or does it do its best to replicate itself with its current fatigue?”

When I want to take a “deep peak” I tell Neuroscientist to watch the innocent movements with light, and invite remarks of the activity at a Synaptic Cleft.
A spike in action potential. 
Essentially pondering my own terminal of Axons. 
I wonder the potential of exacting many actions and conditions. 

On a surface level, others see lights and action to think: 
“Excellent. There’s some activity let’s correlate or plot from here”.
But inside, an inescapable clash of mental elements.
Several astronomical, nano-storms that don’t deform or disappear, but still manage to formulate some traction. 

Still comprised of fierce winds that take the pate of the pate of seemingly infinite collisions and interactions. 

Still get a headache, and for its alleviation I collect giant terrestrial rouge planets. 
Condense them to drop them in to mellow it out. 
I am convinced it can put some breaks on the massive gas formulated from the impacts when they sink in. 

Take all the eyes from those storms with a refined purpose. 
Develop them in other inner layers capable to contribute to the Occipital lobe.
Then probe below to see what is derived to unfold.
Unload the difference in the consequences of what’s possible, actual, and eventual. 

While eyes scroll, I stroll through the paragraph dropping letters in quanta and increments of spaces of intended structure.
Basically the words of an alphabetical order that correlation will push to envelop.
Seemingly infinite things being completed easily. 

May drop a scroll to summon and station Calculus at my penultimate statement just in case “Paradox” ever saw that, and wanted to come back.
It’s sure to be something it can’t handle. 

Fallacy and Paradox now on a tandem. 
While the “pen” merely synthesizes traps, I leave traps in this poem to patrol what one will read at random. 

(“Pen” concede too I’m too lazy for a Part 2; let’s put it to rest). 

I confess:
Want to know what I’m impressed with? 
Took the Stage painted it with variations of complexity and complicated vibrantly moving Colors.

I’ve seen this was another game. 
The scene I named is, 
“If smaller, what do I control?”, and dream a first episode.

Control things in a meters of magnitude. 
Sticks, stones, structures, and some animals as work or food. 

At negative 7, can unfold Deoxyribonucleic acid and can compact it in any way.

At negative 9, manipulation of molecules and molecular bonds and could do it on any day. 

At negative 11, even if the Organism was named Atom doesn’t matter I control it as well as many aspects of the environment. 

At negative 15, no need find elements.
Collect atoms all as “heaps” to use for whatever as a common measure. 

At negative 18, a more exact point, where I control the environment in all aspects. 
Even took a trip back interact with the neutrinos that passed me, near the outer zone. 

The sinking is terse then expands intone. 
Naturally a milestone in the process until it’s ripe. 
Ironically a patchouli for Capacity to reach and climb out the verse. 

Some static when learning of Types. 
Not even all personalities are the same even when they are in the same category. 

Concluded it dynamically, and have met many others.
I’m merely only one, but at three I was Meruem as well as Mewtwo when comprehending my existence in relation to the environment and its process. 

Kiyotaka Ayanokōji in elementary school, and there’s still adults in the world that are intimidated by that of what I had to be. 

Shiba Tatsuya when I’m clocked-in. 
Hotaro Oreki when I’m forced to work with other people in group project.

I’m Halku to all friends and everyone. 
Fyodor Dostoevsky when I fuse my IQ and EQ with views of existence combined with aspects of my sense of humor. 
Drop in the scene as an antagonist of protagonist standing around, and dissect my adversaries with the demeanor and thoughts as Kagetoki Kariya. 

Done with my eyes closed.
Compress them for they realize. 
An undefeated band of words with a sharp blade that can cast damage, and lives to the points of its vengeance. 
The DOOM of being a Villain.
I’ll be an A.F.R.O Samurai. 

Kyoko Kirigiri when analyzing an aftermath of an event. 
Kazuya Shibuya when I have found a hint.
Loid Forger on regular day of in my inner thoughts and facial expressions to random things. 
Elegance with my eloquence and public relations. 

Sōsuke Aizen when I have to go against magnitudes of many, and I’m only one.
Meijin Kawaguchi when playing games in PvP. 
Ryota Sakamoto when playing the same games in PvE. 

Alucard when I’m showing good sportsmanship to other humans, then obliterate them completely right at the end of single-player competition.

Kilik when I see an equation that dared to even test me, or in all group competitions or games like a first generation gravity child. 
Formulated occults and secret networks where I am admired in the same ways as William James Moriarty. 

Hei when I sometimes lose motivation, but still carry on even though others know my abilities and seen past feats.
When feeling defeated and livid, I’m Lelouch vi Brittania in introspection.
Plotting other plans with abundance and surplus patience. 

Accepted a Battle Rap at night.
I never went.
Summoned Daylyt in my presence instead.
Had the adversary bemused of the time of day.

At negative 35, pulling it down to infinite depths. Have already proven to function at the plank-length.

I could tear open the Black Hole that formed from the singularity of all that I curled in earlier in the verse that I let burst. 
M87 or an X-1 “next” which ever one claimed that it had it first. 

Sight white in an electromagnetic combined spectrum then turn off its source.
Report a field of what is there, but now captured in complete darkness. 

A steed of strange speed.
A Photon is forced. 
In its course, distort space/time. 
Everything around is hardly accelerating at all in comparison to how fast it is in its infinite grounds. 

Colors aren’t lazy in the Kingdom of classification.
Locked Time right out of finite and Infinity. 
Now there is only Infinity and Capacity, out of the cage. 
An inescapable causality.
Perpendicularly confined in this instance to trace a path that is now uncapped with no impulse, ageless. 

Looking at the art of what is yet that’s left on a white page. 
Then I engage.
Combined all the colors and shades.
Interesting in comparison to light its all blackness. 

This is Eternal Glome. 
Space of an immortal combat with mutuality in between the vastness. 
Someone commented that the Earth’s flat then I responded: 

“2D-spheres with w rotations appear to look flat, but with 2D-viewing eyes looking at 3D spheres, you’ve never seen that.”

Everything realistic released from the obstacles of possible. 
All Illogical Celestial Clockwork, mathematically logical by formulated demonstration owned to compute. 

I’ll kick an Iron Star.
Then watch Greydon Square detect its rouge activity in his Local Group, and trap it with Triangulation. 

Sometimes truth is vexing to manage.  
In an infinite page, took a deep peak, and dropped through its fabric. 

With so much space even the dense seems hollow. 
In a black lake where things eventually become part and parcel of spheres.
Literally a massive pursuit to play a game of collide and diverge, or gobble.

Swallowed by the shadows with an ever grow. Audio parched in its underflow. 
In its Capacity, an Infinite set of ammo that borrows from its gizmo. 
A gloaming that bestows a show of lotto, and sets of mass that roam aglow.

Prone to its foam. 
An otiose and nebulous proto stage. 
Comb in a combination to glaze rays on loam. 
Catacombs and fallow. 
Varicose collisions calm in time. 
Birth of a biome. 
Home of all distant hollo. 

This is an Eternal Glome.  
Where the life attempts to not forget events of history. 
But keep around the chain of thoughts that repeat most of the effects to claim the stagnation and undetected mystery…
yet still a cycle in history. 
A Cosmic Calendar where a small fraction of what is to be seen is shown. 

I’ve finished my Scotch.
I’ll clean the stains of disdain and try out a new season.
Now the Stage is a Clear room. 
Living in the slow motion of life.
Might as well enjoy the nights of a clear moon. 
My patience is beyond my lifespan, and could watch it all full concentration. 
Though not able to…
Only forced to pull out a mere calculation. 

At that time, there will be a flash of light.
Everything that we experienced and see will turn black again to meet its External Gloom outside of an Internal Glome…

…

…

…

Went back to the outer zone, ripped a part off of what I perceived was a face.
I know it’s not, but it’s time to see what’s under your skin. 
Ended up getting sucked in.
Dropped into the Metaverse.

I looked back for the rip, but tripped into a new domain where only toon constructions exist.
I’m trapped in here in a body with no feeling.
Anything defying physics seems to be possible and willing, and stuck in the verse all alone in an unknown space. 

Still have one trick, use quantum entanglement on the “pen” write the story and tell them all.
But then again, the “pen” can’t beat me so it’s bound to take the credit. 
I’ve plunged down with no leverage, but some say I have always been an innate sleuth.

I’ll await for another one of their minds to meet me here, and at least I have seen the truth. 
With every human entity the same thing in this stream of actions could have been them or me.

I “see”, all the life that is there, and the proof of how each individual is a character living in one reality. 

…

The “pen” didn’t take the credit the nerve of it (🫢). 

It must really want a proper response to fight through (🤔).

Scribed this entire poem “Eternal Glome” on one of its gummy snacks of “The_Silencer_00 vs his pen (Part 1)”. 
As the letters appeared, used “imagination” to rip the fabric of this verse to tunnel back.
While doing that, it’s time to tag in and create then disperse “The_Silencer_00 vs his Pen (Part 2)”

Last month, I tried SBI Unipay(no convenience fee ), but ICICI Bank charged a 1% fee on utility payments next day on my credit card

PhonePe also charges a convenience fee, while the Tata Neu app doesn’t allow bill payments above ₹50,000 via credit card. Similarly, Amazon Pay has a ₹50,000 limit on bill payments.

Is there any way to split payments so I can bring the bill amount below ₹50,000?

I currently have the SBI Cashback Card, Axis Airtel and Ace cards, and the HDFC Tata Neu Infinity card. Any tips on how to maximize cashback while paying bills?

I regularly get bill of 70k pm

Blockchain Gaming: The Future of Fun & Finance?,NFTsMarketplace,1i7ejh2,2025-01-22 11:05:34,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NFTsMarketplace/comments/1i7ejh2/blockchain_gaming_the_future_of_fun_finance/,Slow-Information4751,🎮 NFT Game 🎮,"Imagine a Manila's factory worker, a New York's college student, and an adolescent in India, all on the same digital space, and not just for amusement but to seek financial profit.

With blockchain gaming now leading the fray, the lines of what is considered profit versus play have increasingly blurred, with even in-game items becoming serious business potential.



So, instead of spending hours grinding for prizes that mean nothing outside of games, players are now collecting rare digital objects and trading NFTs for hard cash. What started as a hobby has turned into a full-fledged industry where skill and craft bring in real money.



Gradually, it is now clear that P2E is not a momentary hype but rather an upgrade to the game industry. Games such as Axie Infinity showcased how in-game items and characters could have real-world relevance, and the blockchain game industry could reach $39.7 billion with more big game companies like Ubisoft and Zynga adopting Web3 technology.



Platforms like NCOG Earth Chain, Immutable X, and Gala Games are among those enabling developers to build secure, scalable, and player-centric economies, pushing the evolution of gaming beyond entertainment.



Blockchain's fraud-resistant transactions, true asset ownership, and financial inclusion mean this new technology will, in a short time, change how gaming currently exists. Indeed, the question of change is not if, but, when will this transform digital economies on an international scale?

Scotch with the zone I glone. 
Ripples of what will never be entrapped in the tomb of an External Glome. 

Curved arrows pointing to directions of the same things.
I bi-pass and pedal on the canvas of linear actuality. 

Forced to curve.
Innately confined to escape a casualty.
Perpendicularly to the instance the impulse caps the track of thee. 

Tedious reaction leaving slumber as the moon swings streams, and finds time to meet back on the other side. 

Confabulation with entities.
Unique depictions of interest as I take snapshots of its outer-scope I chose. 

Enclosing an interpretative dose of the same dreams.
A strange glimpse of what hides congruent. 

I coast through time, and loop around the cycles of limitations.

Linking entropy, I chain ink to give life to the points that can’t express without its movement.

Without a page, it’s the same phase.
Letters appear drifting, lifting to conscience.
I leave an eye to peer into the mind of the receiver, and analyze to Light the Stage. 

Mind ablaze. 
Rays wage the plays to channel on.
Prongs of interference dismissed as an innate gauge. 

Infinitesimally undetected insights.
Omnipresent, dribbles what is not to see untapped in its external age.

As Time finds time this time to find Fallacy I trap Capacity, circumscribed by Time in the same cage as Infinity.

Life’s gift is a trillion seconds at most to endure naturally.
At the cusp of a blastocyst, experience has a battery.

Manipulation of Physics as an ability.
Physically held by its characteristics.
DNA…extending rights to this reality.
Birth, survival, preservation, progression, and computation to all force along.

An asymptote to what has happened, and what one will watch in a unique set of membranes temporary to own. 

Impacted in the structure of my INTJ rage I Blaze the Stage, a tone switch. 

A different pitch of levels as I meddle interaction’s contractions with passion, and sheer existence to interfere.
Outer-body searching for what regards as inner fears, and never found it or knew it. 

One posed to persist to be one; I seen through, but on another note I heard at most that was a ghost.

I throw endeavors in a ditch.
Conclude the things that have a hint to peddle with what is evident. 
It’s settled, and was a fun run.

Introspection whispers “inner’s- here”.
I intercept with, “Silence…let Fear speak”.
Now silence at its peak. 

Counted sheep in slumber in a Googolplex magnitude of black ones.
In a bleak domain with an atmosphere of impenetrable black dust. 
Without a rush successfully before I was ejected, and fell to sleep with eyes opened counting none. 

With no conveyance of being perplexed or in disarray; 
reality is what I decide and order.
Then ask the “pen” how was that for a flex?
What’s next isn’t a test of my center of complexity. 

Inserted a fourth-wall before the peer at the other three. 
Have room to enter and store the teem of animals.
Aligned them with their natural numbers plus one.
Named this one “forever more” all contrived from imaginative lnk.

Could have done it with altitude from the standpoint of my aptitude, but on either axis combined is shorter than a planck-length.

Far from its entirety.

I’m suspected to be the host of the inner-body within an interlude passing through society detecting what will ensue. 

Intrude upon some notions of strong forces, but conceptually are meek due to proof being undetected. 

The world won’t reveal a secret of deepness in life’s platitudes of a blueprint though far, the star keeps me in the loop.
Must have been a powerful thump.
Or if in God’s hands at some point, it threw it. 

Almost everything rouge not every intention feasible.
A plain of ultimate goals.
Some unreachable.
Apparently incalculable and extraneously inconceivable.
Until it’s married with dynamic model’s conjunctions of new and old.
That will entail if perception will be the same.

Have the merit intact, compact and slip encryption esoterically.
Enclosing odds in the holes that pretends things to fall in wherever one didn’t know it would go. 

I paint the Stage and its walls with chains.
In this dimension anything connecting this field, is the function’s game to be played forever.

Then let it exist. 
This is another zone a switch of a phase.
Transform the Stage into charades.
Closed my eyes to see.
Imagined it all already, and can tune the sharpness. 

With darkness even I have sight, and my motion still governable. 
Journey planned, completed, and the wind has the same swings. 
In one night, I have more dreams than atoms combined in my sheets and covers keeping the same being comfortable. 
I have only mentioned my daydream after my night dream.
The cycling has looped around, and the moon appears to be rolling over.

Decided to create an epic poem with each page separated.
Designed being inscribed in an indestructible, tall deck of cards. 
Each card was a “page” to engage and you can shuffle it.
And read them all in any order with a unique story coherently.
Accounted for all possibilities of all factors, chronologically.

Thought to publish it, but for comedy adventures decided to spread them all equally out into the world. 
If a person embarks to collect to read, then I’ll meet to talk about the epic experience of one’s Odyssey to obtain it. 
Then take a sip of the Scotch sit back, and let it all unfurl.

Curl everything in…and let it burst.
The curse is using it sagaciously it doesn’t come with other servings. 
Or survive by a massive star to jar some things that you want to take from its death. 

Or realistically don’t survive, and hide to the point where the answer renders too much light to process.
At a time that in time’s scope all life, and all life-span is just a band of light and elements in a palindromic dorm.
None of it at that reference of time left.

Took a visit to the outer zone to pull its cheeks, and suffered a massive blast of neutrinos right back at me.
I wonder if its ongoing swarm goes unnoticed. 
Everything that comes in goes out in whatever shape or form.
The only difference is the increments of time. 
Thus in a cosmic note of temporary experience, we are the ghost.
An uncovered concept to witness, dispute, or cope. 

Some days, I lock down a couple of senses to conduct a day to make sure the active ones are trained and mastered on terrains in extremely difficult conditions. 

Decide to do this exercise in trade of information slipping away all for the sensation. 
Realized the lack of efficiency of that comes natural regardless of the aids of communicative translations. 

To enclosed the cracks, my patience relaxed. 
Created a device that can see worth in everything. 

Was quickly taken back when I sit an object on the Stage. 
Checked to see attraction of movement of worth inside the object, and the entities were playing jumping jacks. 

I guess uncertainty, plays offense and defense. 
I know for certain, that it’s all apart of sequence. 
Hackers playing chess and trail and error on many defenses. 

Viruses bored of only nature, and found its own technology to release in. 
The consequences of being in a con’s sequences of a day and age.

A limit in time. 

We move forward, and can use a tool where it can be given a direction.
Circle around back to my options, and press a square logically.

Force itself that it, and a circle is the same thing. 
One may think non-topologically that’s nonsense, but my senses show improvement a nice amalgamation. 

One not to trust the one that treats one eyes like starlight.
Though starlight in their eyes to peer at others can be a glimpse of admiration. 

Indications of the deep.
Humans scared at my birth because my first words were “It repeats.”
Heard a conversation about souls, and I mistook it as soles at the age of 2.
Told them “Over there, underneath.” 

One night I walked along opened space on a dark street. 
Lurking around the corner appears the disposition of a dark figure. 
Figured that this would be some type of abstract invasion. 

It told me, “You knew that this time would come.”

I interjected with “actually”. 
I only trapped Infinity in my Capacity.
I know that may have took Time,
but knowing when a time will come can be calculated from an equation. 

Not the events during any time interval of the future, and Time found you. 
I don’t have time for you at least not a lot, Fallacy.

“Your time is up. Your highest level of Logic and Philosophy can’t escape.”

Then let it exist.
I’ll play your game it would be easy to in general.
You regularly function in the population, and using my highest level as a bar of inability is a mere quantum smell on the play of your Psychology. 

Strategically, your system of conclusion is an illusion a formal system of thoughts
and nodes.
All made up of an inevitable Paradox verses cells and a brain. 

Since you are an entity too, then let’s confabulate on a Dark Stage.
Perhaps it’s time to paint a hellish scene of shadows with no existence of light in the abyss. 

In peak thoughts when humans mention of their deep thoughts, I sit at a bottom the plethora. 

From my reference point, I’m seeing the stars of their deepest wishes passing by, and anytime I can decide to make a wish on that. 

From a lower room in their mind of frigid climate that’s deeper than the endeavors that I ditched in my own reality. 

Creep in this abyss, and drink from a deep well of rumination.

Consume all the incomplete thoughts that leak in the closed door of a room with complete silence.  

Hide all of their fears in here with me if it’s never found, then at least one still has fear of the unknown.

This is an Eternal Glome.
Explore the lands of the logical logorrhea. 

Exponential cognitively, but physically perceived as a Base Rate…
Fallacy is already on the roll. 

Cognitively assemble illogically, and meet Division fallacy due to possible mutations of Genetic fallacy. 

Appeal to Novelty can show up even in the dimension of formulated idea.
New spark of attention. 
Chronological Snobbery. 

Failed to reverse-engineer it’s getting Ecological.
Would contradict itself at this point if it gets Etymological, not to forget the same “fail” of Association in its deeds. 

One can have a notion that you know nothing.
Then when you prove something respond that it doesn’t count any amount, and other factors are the new goal. 

I put on a mask, and weave freely with no thoughts of correction to The_Silencer_00, ever uncovered. 

During a supper.
I created an event then another event, and collected conclusions from others.
Looked at what existed without the proper data to reach that. 
Then handed them back, what was imagined. 

During another event of festivities, I met a human that told me perception was reality. 
Then recognized based on context there’s multiple perceptions, and simply one reality. 

I don’t talk much through pensive thoughts, and refuse to think to Mind Project subjectivity. 
Still enjoying my glass of Scotch with ice. 
Think one has a hot hand okay, then reroll the dice.

It’s time to see what it’s not. 
Drunk some filtered water then passed out faking it.
Checking if someone will say that the water was dangerous.
I’m mean to a Post-hoc until bewilderment is vaporous. 

Dig up Fallacy, and uncover it to check what’s really evident. 
Destroying an Exception through Overwhelming Exception that’s present. 

One can choose Misleading Vividness in trade for mere relevance.
One reads it all on a computer, and we can see it in one’s assessment with a subjective hint pulling the rug from right under it.

A bluff of perspicacity. 
Have friends that are almost nothing alike that I’ve been around in public.
If same race and gender, then comments exposing assumptions of us to be the same type of people, Faulty Analogy.

An unlikely remark of preference: 
An English teacher substituting a detention room graded the math test.
If he/she knew enough to grade it, then a grade is a grade. 
But if not, then Ergo Decedo’s done its part. 

Address a Bailey quickly, and throw a dart at the pending Motte to address more extensively.
Request a reference for only one Definition to Retreat to. 

Locked Ambiguity and Equivocation out before they rush in to circle their reasons up into a continuum of Incomplete Comparisons, and it won’t stop due to Appeal to Tradition quite easy to see to.  

Some people are controlled by feedback without a question of its intention.

Then when it’s too late the prop’s up it escalates, and can’t understand the gravity within it.
The gravitational influence of being captured by a gimmick. 

Some try to combine Furtive with Appeal to Motive, then attempt to end it swiftly.
Begging the Question to then heighten it with Affirmative Conclusions from a Negative Premise. 

Illogical grounds I’ve seen one take two Correlations then Assume a Cause. 
Then use Reverse Causation to loop it back around acting as if that itself was logically sound.

Tall tales and a fable. 
I’ve have asked Fallacy for a denotation, then given a Loaded Label. 
Affecting not only populations, but nations. Analogous to how Magical Thinking pretends to work with obviously Casual Oversimplifications.

Fallacy, what a disgrace. 
One taking pride on hard-earned lucky result, then don’t understand the multiple ways that it could have been the case. 
I’m glad you materialized to request an eye-to-eye. 

False Guru’s Inflation of Conflict while Quoting out of Context, and heard monologues that bled of Reification that they are sure to deny. 

Even when associating with a person and drinking, my position isn’t By Whiskey.
I have a clear side. 

Let’s visit or do something fun in a town today.
How about I decide to go on a fun ride. 
Someone was disrespected at the entrance of an amusement park, and now hate them all. 
Claimed a ruined day.
Walked, then rolled away. 

What an entertaining bait, Hasty Generalization.
I suppose we “coast” differently.
Then eventually get on a rollercoaster to loop around to the other side. 

Special Pleads wrapped up by False Dilemmas translated in the context of a Loaded Question tided to the mentality of a Taxes Sharpshooter.

That only drew a “Suppressed Correlative” in a wild pursuit to Appeal to Nature. 
All to Appeal to Consequences an interesting composition. 
Affirming a Disjunct, we are bound to meet no Middle Ground. 

I’ll pick one off discreetly, immediately in a situation. 
Raise a voice with a sentence on propose in a particular tone to see who will raise a badge of a Tone Police, and Fallacy a point is loss. 
Manipulation of the outcome without changing anything that I really said. 

Retrospective Determinism as an expense of deductions lost.
Though wrong many times, perhaps the feeling of being right is the reason of the Sink Cost. 

If one Appeals to Authority or Accomplishment I’ll reply,
 “Well I just came from space and met some aliens that accomplished what you’ve never known”. 

Stare at them while their mind processes that, then hear a response with a composition that Appeals to Stone. 

After that trick, I’ll accuse them of Personal Incredulity. 
Then tell them that they could have believed me if they chose to Appeal to Ignorance instead. 

Later to demonstrate Capacity, and its gates without its Limits cupped. 

Simulate reality outside of a box that’s bigger than someone, then watch them call 5 people to come to pick up a box that’s empty.

After finding out that it’s lightweight, I’ll put a much smaller box right beside the other box.
Watch one person try to pick it up oneself.
Only after assessing weight, one realized two others may be needed to pick the smaller box up. 

Next time I’ll do it with a ball, and define another game that I don’t know what to call.
Decided to keep its denotation loose, and reduced it to a separation of clear aims. 

Catch one Red-Handed in attempts or remarks that veer from a claim. 
Some claim me to be Emotionless because they can’t Appeal to mine. 
Then we dive right into the Burden of Proof. 

I might sit them on Bandwagon on top of a frictionless plate with the Ruler, and place them on a slight edge while on top of a Slippery Slope to see how many Straw-Mans that they can dodge from all the ones that they ever formulated and produced. 

After that, eject Fallacy right off the bandwagon of Prevalent Proof. 

Someone may have to use silence wisely to not “Prove too Much”. 
Some others treat one’s silence or lack of response as evidence acting if “silence speaks”, and told it all. 

Analyze the land before me. 
Trivial Objections as if an existence of a response has kept its momentum to the claim against it. 
Once thought as safe, only to formulate a Kettle-Story. 
Shall I ever forget…the world is complex in the context inclosed in what is predisposed to be presupposed. 

Try to address some other people with direct things, and a statement about something unrelated could be the response to oppose it. 
Not surprise that it is a bunch of this.

I could surmise that Fallacy dislikes this game.
Ashamed for it because this time it’s not a Homunculus. 

Proof by Assertion has much effect on the youth…from a standpoint of Affirming the Consequent. 
Relating that, I detect something relativistic. 
Vexed on a random day when I make a remark, and meet Ignoratio Elenchi.

Preceding after that, a Psychologist fallacy.
If that wasn’t enough, then conclude it all with a thought Terminating Cliche. 
The rest of my time, I remain quiet. 
Mentally shaking my head at everything caught that was Anecdotal mixed in with Moralistic. 

Some notions easy to refute is a nice fine process of Cherries Picked, and is like a Nirvana itself. 
Yet, a spacious room for Vacuous Truth combined with things unrealistic.

What else is there to store to add to the mix.
Regression Fallacy of one that thought that it could knock some sense into an object, and have it fixed. 
Later on witnessed the same person throwing it around as an attempt to fix it more, a comical sight.

Or one can think like a gambler on a lucky night: 
“If I take this test and answer it, perhaps I will randomly get one right. 
And if that happens, hopefully that one right will provide a streak, and the other ones will start to be more right too”, then turn in it. 

Learned some physical laws while putting check marks on whatever is a False Cause. 
Predictions locked in a prism, and already seen by many eyes. 

Used a profile pic that’s not me of a random color, and get a neutral or positive response.
Change it to myself, and get Courtier’s Replies.
Then I laugh at the possible Bulverism. 

When I’m bored of what to do, I pull out a Bong that has powers and constant feats of winning. 
If I tell it to fetch, then it can easily catch a Tu Quoque in nanoseconds at its beginning.

Trap it right in its dominion. 
Then pour water inside let’s see it float on a boat of its deception, and watch everything in the closed system turn in to vapor. 

Was told to add Two Wrongs on a sheet of paper, and turned in it blank.
Fallacy wrote “a Right”, and gave it back to me. 
(Sure, “a Right”…Entitlement of Opinion). 

I won’t provoke, disappear a False Equivalence.
Used one of the pet pen’s powers to cast a spell on its resilience. 

Keep a clear sheer away from false truths, and avoidance to the ever-persistent “No True Scotsman”. 
Fill the Stage up with Water, and put Fallacy and Paradox in the same tank as cousins of the same existence. 

Fallacy why the silence. 
Claim the conclusion that Fallacy itself is a Virus. 
Fallacy now gains the courage to claim,
“Haha you have now lost The_Silencer_00. You have now loss to a Fallacy”. 

I explained to Fallacy that it needs a host to spew from, and fallacious thoughts really have real effects on reality.
Thus you got bored biologically, technologically, and live in your perfect matrix in the realm of “abstraction”.

You’re trapped now.
Thanks for the invasion courtesy of Time’s wish if you might forget. 
Fallacy you have almost reached your maximum “allotted” time. 

It went from on roll to defeated, and trolled by circumscribing it in “Fallacy, fallacy”. 
Fallacy how about we switch the game, and call it “A Paradox how?”
…and see what I don’t let exist. 

Casted Fallacy away to attempt to do a Lump of Labor in a complex business world. 
Checked the context of a Paradox, and summoned myself to a pervasive one.
A Grandfather saw me walking up and panicked. 
Handed it the Second and Third law of Thermodynamics. 

Here’s a Heap of information. 
Then it asked me “What is a Heap?”
I stated, no need to be persuasive.
Whoever is inclined can decide “when something’s a heap” whenever they decide. 
It’s time to leave.

I’m dismissed don’t forget this time, but one can try to reverse time unlocking the door. 
Leap a question at me about what it is worth some time, and my response to it will be why bother. 

Feeling refreshed as I left the temple. 
Paradox attempted to loop back summoned itself as Hemple. 
Escaped Unexpected Examination by creation of two time banks.

One is allotted time right before the first time of the possible test. 
The rest in a bubble of possibilities of more time that may be there, but not determined yet. 
Prepare the best for the first day of the first time of the possible test.
If there take the test. 
If not there, then a new set of time conveyed in the constraints of the lapse of time before the time and day that’s possibly the day of the test. 

Hemple in front of me.
It told me “All ravens are Black”. 
Examination expected. 
I reply a dubious,
“Is that so? I wonder the equation as I comprehend what you said.
I wonder of others.”
While my cream-colored pet raven flew right over its head, and might even signal it to circle back. 

Checking this time to see if one will conceive it. 
A long time ago discovered the nature of truth:
“This statement is false”
Statements are to access and conclude, then to decide if one will truly believe it. 

Yet usually only utilize and realize this when receiver stumbles upon statement that one automatically won’t believe in or inconceivable. Fundamentally a meter of conscious, and subconscious calculations of what’s reasonable. 
An endless stream of notions to contest what is or is not believable. 

Physics in its reality. 
Dichotomy Paradox, Not.
Mathematics can provide proofs for reality, but one must distinguish the difference of when it’s real equations or abstract in its confines. 

Perfection has nothing to do with Murder.
70% verse 100% efficiency of two crimes. 
If both get away, then they have both crossed the line of the same outcome regardless of the tactics or the crumbles of detection. 

Dipped off to dive in the near body water to take a dip in.
Baited by an illusionary encounter of Theseus ship, and it won’t be forsaken. 
I stated,
“Nice to see that it survived all of the trips. It’s amazing to see this ship’s over-time transformation.”

Paradox asked me “What about the other ship?”
I said:
“Get a grip, on the situation. 
Add some adhesives, and go create another ship of old parts that was once used for another ship. 

Even if you take a trip on that ‘ship’, you can still trip on the newly built ship of that ship sharing the first ship’s stream of continuity that can’t divide since old parts were linked to other’s initial experience of the same function.”
Then leave the scene as I drip off.  

“Hey Paradox, next time you see Fallacy ask him did he find the Lump.”
Now Paradox even feels trumped, and is ticked off. 

I request to concede.
Paradox is pissed off. 
Threatened to have my near future attacked from a start of a Self-replicating Machine, and before I know it will be 10,000 more. 

My last response was,
“Hope you dream with 100% efficiency, and please exceed to reach that glory or a Shor Algorithm. 
I am surely safe, but cool story. 
For now, I’ll await for that on a later time”, and left the shore. 

Disappeared like a spider’s web in the wind. 
Left Paradox a letter discussing its capacities that stated,

“Bring that up again before me in life, and we may have to catch an elephant in the room. 
The sources of those batteries. 
Not to impede, but I’m intrigued what will the answer be…only rhetorically. 
Does the machine replicate what it wishes to be, or does it do its best to replicate itself with its current fatigue?”

When I want to take a “deep peak” I tell Neuroscientist to watch the innocent movements with light, and invite remarks of the activity at a Synaptic Cleft.
A spike in action potential. 
Essentially pondering my own terminal of Axons. 
I wonder the potential of exacting many actions and conditions. 

On a surface level, others see lights and action to think: 
“Excellent. There’s some activity let’s correlate or plot from here”.
But inside, an inescapable clash of mental elements.
Several astronomical, nano-storms that don’t deform or disappear, but still manage to formulate some traction. 

Still comprised of fierce winds that take the pate of the pate of seemingly infinite collisions and interactions. 

Still get a headache, and for its alleviation I collect giant terrestrial rouge planets. 
Condense them to drop them in to mellow it out. 
I am convinced it can put some breaks on the massive gas formulated from the impacts when they sink in. 

Take all the eyes from those storms with a refined purpose. 
Develop them in other inner layers capable to contribute to the Occipital lobe.
Then probe below to see what is derived to unfold.
Unload the difference in the consequences of what’s possible, actual, and eventual. 

While eyes scroll, I stroll through the paragraph dropping letters in quanta and increments of spaces of intended structure.
Basically the words of an alphabetical order that correlation will push to envelop.
Seemingly infinite things being completed easily. 

May drop a scroll to summon and station Calculus at my penultimate statement just in case “Paradox” ever saw that, and wanted to come back.
It’s sure to be something it can’t handle. 

Fallacy and Paradox now on a tandem. 
While the “pen” merely synthesizes traps, I leave traps in this poem to patrol what one will read at random. 

(“Pen” concede too I’m too lazy for a Part 2; let’s put it to rest). 

I confess:
Want to know what I’m impressed with? 
Took the Stage painted it with variations of complexity and complicated vibrantly moving Colors.

I’ve seen this was another game. 
The scene I named is, 
“If smaller, what do I control?”, and dream a first episode.

Control things in a meters of magnitude. 
Sticks, stones, structures, and some animals as work or food. 

At negative 7, can unfold Deoxyribonucleic acid and can compact it in any way.

At negative 9, manipulation of molecules and molecular bonds and could do it on any day. 

At negative 11, even if the Organism was named Atom doesn’t matter I control it as well as many aspects of the environment. 

At negative 15, no need find elements.
Collect atoms all as “heaps” to use for whatever as a common measure. 

At negative 18, a more exact point, where I control the environment in all aspects. 
Even took a trip back interact with the neutrinos that passed me, near the outer zone. 

The sinking is terse then expands intone. 
Naturally a milestone in the process until it’s ripe. 
Ironically a patchouli for Capacity to reach and climb out the verse. 

Some static when learning of Types. 
Not even all personalities are the same even when they are in the same category. 

Concluded it dynamically, and have met many others.
I’m merely only one, but at three I was Meruem as well as Mewtwo when comprehending my existence in relation to the environment and its process. 

Kiyotaka Ayanokōji in elementary school, and there’s still adults in the world that are intimidated by that of what I had to be. 

Shiba Tatsuya when I’m clocked-in. 
Hotaro Oreki when I’m forced to work with other people in group project.

I’m Halku to all friends and everyone. 
Fyodor Dostoevsky when I fuse my IQ and EQ with views of existence combined with aspects of my sense of humor. 
Drop in the scene as an antagonist of protagonist standing around, and dissect my adversaries with the demeanor and thoughts as Kagetoki Kariya. 

Done with my eyes closed.
Compress them for they realize. 
An undefeated band of words with a sharp blade that can cast damage, and lives to the points of its vengeance. 
The DOOM of being a Villain.
I’ll be an A.F.R.O Samurai. 

Kyoko Kirigiri when analyzing an aftermath of an event. 
Kazuya Shibuya when I have found a hint.
Loid Forger on regular day of in my inner thoughts and facial expressions to random things. 
Elegance with my eloquence and public relations. 

Sōsuke Aizen when I have to go against magnitudes of many, and I’m only one.
Meijin Kawaguchi when playing games in PvP. 
Ryota Sakamoto when playing the same games in PvE. 

Alucard when I’m showing good sportsmanship to other humans, then obliterate them completely right at the end of single-player competition.

Kilik when I see an equation that dared to even test me, or in all group competitions or games like a first generation gravity child. 
Formulated occults and secret networks where I am admired in the same ways as William James Moriarty. 

Hei when I sometimes lose motivation, but still carry on even though others know my abilities and seen past feats.
When feeling defeated and livid, I’m Lelouch vi Brittania in introspection.
Plotting other plans with abundance and surplus patience. 

Accepted a Battle Rap at night.
I never went.
Summoned Daylyt in my presence instead.
Had the adversary bemused of the time of day.

At negative 35, pulling it down to infinite depths. Have already proven to function at the plank-length.

I could tear open the Black Hole that formed from the singularity of all that I curled in earlier in the verse that I let burst. 
M87 or an X-1 “next” which ever one claimed that it had it first. 

Sight white in an electromagnetic combined spectrum then turn off its source.
Report a field of what is there, but now captured in complete darkness. 

A steed of strange speed.
A Photon is forced. 
In its course, distort space/time. 
Everything around is hardly accelerating at all in comparison to how fast it is in its infinite grounds. 

Colors aren’t lazy in the Kingdom of classification.
Locked Time right out of finite and Infinity. 
Now there is only Infinity and Capacity, out of the cage. 
An inescapable causality.
Perpendicularly confined in this instance to trace a path that is now uncapped with no impulse, ageless. 

Looking at the art of what is yet that’s left on a white page. 
Then I engage.
Combined all the colors and shades.
Interesting in comparison to light its all blackness. 

This is Eternal Glome. 
Space of an immortal combat with mutuality in between the vastness. 
Someone commented that the Earth’s flat then I responded: 

“2D-spheres with w rotations appear to look flat, but with 2D-viewing eyes looking at 3D spheres, you’ve never seen that.”

Everything realistic released from the obstacles of possible. 
All Illogical Celestial Clockwork, mathematically logical by formulated demonstration owned to compute. 

I’ll kick an Iron Star.
Then watch Greydon Square detect its rouge activity in his Local Group, and trap it with Triangulation. 

Sometimes truth is vexing to manage.  
In an infinite page, took a deep peak, and dropped through its fabric. 

With so much space even the dense seems hollow. 
In a black lake where things eventually become part and parcel of spheres.
Literally a massive pursuit to play a game of collide and diverge, or gobble.

Swallowed by the shadows with an ever grow. Audio parched in its underflow. 
In its Capacity, an Infinite set of ammo that borrows from its gizmo. 
A gloaming that bestows a show of lotto, and sets of mass that roam aglow.

Prone to its foam. 
An otiose and nebulous proto stage. 
Comb in a combination to glaze rays on loam. 
Catacombs and fallow. 
Varicose collisions calm in time. 
Birth of a biome. 
Home of all distant hollo. 

This is an Eternal Glome.  
Where the life attempts to not forget events of history. 
But keep around the chain of thoughts that repeat most of the effects to claim the stagnation and undetected mystery…
yet still a cycle in history. 
A Cosmic Calendar where a small fraction of what is to be seen is shown. 

I’ve finished my Scotch.
I’ll clean the stains of disdain and try out a new season.
Now the Stage is a Clear room. 
Living in the slow motion of life.
Might as well enjoy the nights of a clear moon. 
My patience is beyond my lifespan, and could watch it all full concentration. 
Though not able to…
Only forced to pull out a mere calculation. 

At that time, there will be a flash of light.
Everything that we experienced and see will turn black again to meet its External Gloom outside of an Internal Glome…

…

…

…

Went back to the outer zone, ripped a part off of what I perceived was a face.
I know it’s not, but it’s time to see what’s under your skin. 
Ended up getting sucked in.
Dropped into the Metaverse.

I looked back for the rip, but tripped into a new domain where only toon constructions exist.
I’m trapped in here in a body with no feeling.
Anything defying physics seems to be possible and willing, and stuck in the verse all alone in an unknown space. 

Still have one trick, use quantum entanglement on the “pen” write the story and tell them all.
But then again, the “pen” can’t beat me so it’s bound to take the credit. 
I’ve plunged down with no leverage, but some say I have always been an innate sleuth.

I’ll await for another one of their minds to meet me here, and at least I have seen the truth. 
With every human entity the same thing in this stream of actions could have been them or me.

I “see”, all the life that is there, and the proof of how each individual is a character living in one reality. 

…

The “pen” didn’t take the credit the nerve of it (🫢). 

It must really want a proper response to fight through (🤔).

Scribed this entire poem “Eternal Glome” on one of its gummy snacks of “The_Silencer_00 vs his pen (Part 1)”. 
As the letters appeared, used “imagination” to rip the fabric of this verse to tunnel back.
While doing that, it’s time to tag in and create then disperse “The_Silencer_00 vs his Pen (Part 2)”

芝商所（CME Group）计划推出三种元宇宙加密资产的参考利率和实时指数，使投资者能够使用传统金融中常用的方法更可靠地跟踪定价数据。从1月30日开始，CME Group和CF Benchmarks将推出Axie Infinity(AXS)、Chiliz(CHZ)和Decentraland(MANA)的参考汇率。参考汇率和指数非可交易产品，而是CME Group加密货币产品。资产的参考利率将以美元计价，并于伦敦时间每日下午4点公布。，在简单的谈话中，ChatGPT与GPT-4可能看不出太大差距。但是，当任务的复杂性达到足够的阈值时，差异就会出现——GPT-4比GPT-3.5更可靠、更有创意，并且能够处理更细微的指令。，与此同时，高盛最近宣布，该银行新的数字资产平台GS DAP?已经上线。GS DAP?的首次发行1亿欧元的两年期数字债券，也标志着首个全数字化原生债券。芝商所和高盛的动作为元宇宙投融资市场的进一步扩大提供了“范本”，DAI To 港元 Free Online 为同类产品开创了先河。。\
欧易OKX合约量化。RqVSbykU蓝色光标在互动平台表示，公司正在积极试用ChatGPT技术，自有虚拟人苏小妹已经介入了AI多轮对话，AI作诗能力已经进入技术测试阶段，未来会结合AIGC和终端交互做更多数字化拓展；同时，公司也在做其他ChatGPT产品的试用和调试。AI技术在蓝色光标已早有应用，并且在蓝色宇宙布局伊始，AI化就是三条技术主线之一。，火必還有安全備付金，總額為 20,000 枚 BTC（約為 336 億台幣），用於發生緊急事件時可拿來補償客戶，谷歌已向人工智能初创公司Anthropic投资约3亿美元，据三位知情人士透露，谷歌将通过这笔交易获得约10%的股份，交易条款要求Anthropic用这笔钱从谷歌云计算部门购买计算资源。OpenAI和Anthropic都在寻求开发生成式人工智能，即可以在几秒钟内编写脚本和创作艺术的复杂计算机程序。据知情人士透露，虽然微软试图将OpenAI的技术整合到自己的许多服务中，但谷歌与Anthropic的关系仅限于在人工智能军备竞赛中充当该公司的技术供应商。Anthropic开发了一款名为Claude的智能聊天机器人，可与OpenAI的ChatGPT相媲美，但尚未公开发布。此前消息，Alameda/FTX向Anthropic投资约5亿美元。，費率優惠是終身的。所以能搞一定要搞。\
但对于资金和技术实力欠缺的企业或创业者来说，利用大厂开源模型，优先采用接口模式，结合自身产品，将重心放在更具体的需求场景上，或许才是最优的选择。，不滿一天計為一天，使用的利息率按照借貸時對應的利息率。，百度、腾讯、阿里、字节跳动等互联网大厂也在“争分夺秒”开发自有大模型，百度宣布将于3月16日推出类似产品“文心一言”，腾讯针对类ChatGPT产品已成立“混元助手”项目组，阿里巴巴则表示其聊天机器人正处于研发内测阶段。。\
OpenAI在报告中表示，随着模型规模的增加，模型的准确度本应逐渐下降，但GPT-4逆转了这一趋势，下图显示预测精确度提升到了100。，GPT4.0一一给出回答：，ｃ４尿４誡ｘ嘔ｎ报告预测称，到2030年年轻一代（Y、Z和Alpha世代）将成为迄今为止最大的奢侈品买家，占全球奢侈品消费者的80%。，火币网成立于2013年9月，由甲骨文前程式设计师李林和市场行政人员杜军创立。。。\
欧易OKX合约量化註冊時候用其中一個就可以，一般都是用現貨邀請碼。，这件事给我极大的震撼，也是我首次被加密市场教育，我将此归结于个人的投研能力不够。18年底，熊市到来后，我离职来到一家内容平台，但也在持续关注币圈相关消息，尝到了小赚多次的甜头。20年6月，我发现BTC价格在1万美元，在此之前，1万可以认为是铁顶，在此背景下，认知不够的我挂单20倍合约做空BTC，而在振荡期中，BTC也一度低于9800美元，我更坚信自己的判断，但7月之后，在机构的推动下，BTC一路高涨，从而开启了前所未见的大牛市，我最终以爆仓收场。，在《有害内容》中，我们讨论了类似的能力如何被滥用来剥削个人。在这里，我们讨论了关于虚假信息和影响操作的普遍关注基于我们的总体能力评估，我们期望GPT-4在生成现实的、有针对性的内容方面优于GPT-3。，用户的资产一旦转移到链上，很多用户行为也会从交易所转移到链上。比如会有更多的用户使用像Uniswap、Aave这样链上的去中心化金融产品，寻找新投资机会和收益机会。。\
现在人工智能正处于一个决定性的时刻，就像90年代的互联网以及iPhone带来的手机变革，人工智能正朝着大规模采用的方向发展，ChatGPT类的大模型正推动数据革命。，退一步讲，即使找到了一家公正的审计公司进行审计，默克尔树证明也还需要足够多的用户来辅助验证。并不是只要交易所挪用了用户资产，由少数几个用户进行验证就能100%确定，它需要有一定的样本容量。，景做很紧盘谭卵织龚者并筝阳厨票指院明句钓程叉丧林货绞而钳斯溉输幅挑坝打坛飘跨扰牌申株诊翻迟有惯演课政倦饼培任悠时挑哥宣劫庙瘦讽璃宫裁漂申布另一主流加密貨幣以太幣則是在事件發生至今數天內跌了一成，本月以來跌7%，若以之前FTX、Terra Luna事件，常常一天就能跌掉10%幅度來相較，都不算嚴重。因此，要推測加密貨幣因幣安事件開始崩盤，目前還看不出來。。\
近日，由上海环交所参与、云南电网有限责任公司牵头申报的国家重点研发计划“区块链”重点专项“基于区块链的可信碳交易与碳中和管理示范应用”获工信部批复立项。该项目是成功立项的首个区块链碳交易应用的国家重点研发计划项目。，会影响大家的心态，因为AIGC在构图、设计、展览、创意领域都有能力，我们就有同事会焦虑，尤其是年纪比较大的，他也知道这是趋势，但他会担心学不会。，该论文继续研究 transformer 的运作机理，文章中认为 induction heads 可能是任何规模 transformer 模型的 in-context learning 的运作机制来源。，擔心重演FTX破產事件，投資者瘋狂擠兌。\
欧易OKX合约量化测试结果显示，在测试26种语言中的24种中，GPT-4优于 GPT-3.5和其他 LLM（Chinchilla、PaLM）的英语语言性能，包括拉脱维亚语、威尔士语和斯瓦希里语等低资源语言：，币安自今年4月以来，陆续面对各地监管机构收紧审查。其中，Binance Alipay=EOS AcceptorsMarkets在6月遭英国监管机构下禁令，因为担心该平台无法有力防范洗钱和其他金融犯罪。，在一系列领域——包括带有文本和照片的文档、图表或屏幕截图——GPT-4 展示了与纯文本输入类似的功能。，XdLbzaBl与之前的GPT模型一样，我们使用强化学习和人类反馈(RLHF)对模型的行为进行微调，以产生更好地符合用户意图的响应。。\

Fan not spinning consistently on Kraken Elite 280 with 4 pin connector,NZXT,1i610s5,2025-01-20 16:03:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NZXT/comments/1i610s5/fan_not_spinning_consistently_on_kraken_elite_280/,DommiArt,#QUESTIONS,"I am building my first PC and am having issues with fans not fully cooperating with the Kraken. I am using Lian Li SL Infinity Uni Fans. I have the two 140 fans daisy chained and connected to the motherboard RGB and the 4 pin fan header on the Kraken breakout cable.

One of the fans (the back one with the fan wire connected, if it matters) clicks every few seconds in a steady rhythm and visually slows down before speeding back up. In CAM the RPM flickers between 0 and various numbers, like 42 or 209. I am able to control the speeds of the fans but that does not stop the behavior of the back fan.

For troubleshooting, I have already set the motherboard (Gigabyte Aorus B650 Elite AX Ice) to have all fans go at full speed. I checked the 2 other fan headers on the Kraken breakout cable with 3 pins and they fix the issue, no clicking inconsistent fan. However, that means it is impossible to know the RPM for the fans.

At this point I am inclined to believe that there may be an issue not having proper connection with the fans due to some sort of defect in the NZXT breakout cable. But before I go down that rabbit hole with RMAing it, I wanted to see if anyone else had any other ideas here.

Thanks in advance"

`I don't consider myself an ftl-optimist, and I realize that it is quite equivalent to time travel. This post is not questioning the possibility or impossibility of FTL, only considering IF it is possible, and possible exotic consequences to the Fermi Paradox.`

  
  
The general consensus is that FTL technologies only complicate the Fermi Paradox. But even as an FTL pessimist, I have found a number of arguments that allow for the coexistence of the Fermi Paradox and FTL technologies of a certain kind. The first assumption is that the universe is not closed on itself, but instead is infinite along at least one axis. The second assumption is that FTL technologies are possible and are developing extremely rapidly in civilizations over astronomical time intervals. The third assumption is that FTL travel unlocks time travel simply by definition of its nature. A minor argument is that by unlocking time travel, FTL technologies automatically replace the colonization of three-dimensional space with four-dimensional space-time. The four-dimensional volume is much larger than the three-dimensional one. Colonizing the universe from its inception to the end of time gives a lot of four-dimensional space in which civilization can disperse. We can currently observe only the light cone of the past in the space around us, when the universe is still very young (compared to all the times of the future).  


**If X (X > 1) times lightspeed is possible, what stops from reaching ANY ftl speed?**  
The major argument is about a different strange effect. Suppose that the rapid development of FTL technologies allows us to quickly skip the stage of speeds only a few times higher than light, and quickly allows to migrate far beyond the cosmological event horizon, or perhaps even allows only such trans-horizon migrations. Then, for a civilization that has mastered such technologies, the entire infinite universe becomes open, and in fact is divided into conditional spheres limited by its cosmological event horizon, although for them this horizon will no longer be an impenetrable wall. From this point of view, one can imagine the universe as a Hilbert Hotel or a first-level multiverse, a thought experiment to demonstrate the nature of infinity. An infinite hotel where individual hotel rooms symbolize finite horizon-limited bubble universes. Let's assume that civilizations colonize other bubbles but eventually die out (or disappear for other reasons) in the original bubbles, which is mathematically similar to regular migrations. If it is possible to colonize up to infinitely distant bubbles of the universe, then the concentration of civilizations in a particular bubble of the universe can not only increase but also can decrease with time, becoming sparser, and given the desire of civilizations to exist in less populated bubble universes, a decrease in concentration is more likely than an increase."
Got rejected for Amex MRCC. Should I apply for Gold Charge? Or wait for 90 days and reapply?,CreditCardsIndia,1i5k99d,2025-01-20 01:43:47,1,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i5k99d/got_rejected_for_amex_mrcc_should_i_apply_for/,Redditx89,Help Needed/ Question,"Hi everyone!

So my application for the MRCC card was just rejected.

When I spoke to the customer care, they said I filled in the details in the wrong format even though the details matched with my Aadhar.

Anyway, now I'm stuck having to wait 90 days before I can re-apply.

However, I pay 20k in rent every month and it's my only major expense that I haven't been able to cover for rewards/cashback.

I already own the following cards:

1. Moneyback Plus: First CC, active mostly for bank offers.
2. HDFC Swiggy: Dineout, Food, Groceries.
3. Airtel Axis: Recharge, Utilities.
4. SBI Cashback: Everything else not covered by the two above like Fuel, etc. 

I don't have a UPI card. Got rejected for Kiwi and I make only 70k so can't apply for Tata Neu Infinity.I don't spend a lot through UPI, so wasn't worried about it.

Rent on the other hand is a major chunk of my expenses. But now that MRCC was rejected, idk what would be the best approach here for the next 3 months.

Should I wait for 3 months and apply for the MRCC first? Or should I try my luck with Gold Charge/Smart Earn to get at least some points during these months?

I was thinking about Plat Travel too but I think 4L might be super difficult for me to hit."

After joining this sub I have started using it Smartly i.e Taking gift cards from neu app.
~ Swiggy, I mostly order from the app and go 2-3 times for Dineout.
~ Ixigo - I wanted another card for lounge Access. ( For family members)
~ Axis - As of now I have 2 prepaid sims and wifi from airtel. 
~ SBI - For online spending 

1. Should I really progress towards getting a core card from HDFC? As I will have to close the co branded ones to get it. If so what will be the benefits I give get except the offering from these cards?

2. Is there any other way to use the cards that I have more efficiently as I might have missed something?

3. Does the SBI Cashback card works for OLA/UBER App?
Went through this but it wasn't clear.

4. For amazon shopping, can I pay directly from card for cashback or do I need to buy gift cards?

5. Came accross some post that park+ app has stopped taking credit card as option for gift card. Does the cashback for park+ still works? If yes, Guide me the best way to use the app with SBI Cashback card.

The Evolution of the Crypto World: Beyond Bitcoin and Blockchain,TradingElite,1i53fxi,2025-01-19 12:15:49,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1i53fxi/the_evolution_of_the_crypto_world_beyond_bitcoin/,Maylights,,"The cryptocurrency world, once defined solely by Bitcoin, has evolved into a vast and multifaceted ecosystem. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the crypto landscape is a hub of innovation, disruption, and opportunity. Let’s explore the current state of the crypto world, its challenges, and what the future may hold.

**The Rise of Altcoins: More Than Bitcoin**

While Bitcoin remains the flagship cryptocurrency, thousands of altcoins have emerged to address specific market needs. Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications (dApps). Coins like Solana and Cardano aim to offer faster transaction speeds and scalability, while stablecoins like USDT and USDC provide a bridge between the volatility of crypto and the stability of fiat currencies.

**Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A Financial Revolution**

DeFi has transformed how we think about traditional financial services. Platforms like Aave, Uniswap, and MakerDAO allow users to lend, borrow, and trade assets without intermediaries. Yield farming and staking have created new income streams for investors, empowering individuals while challenging the dominance of centralized institutions.

**NFTs: Redefining Ownership**

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have turned digital art, music, and collectibles into verifiable assets. From Beeple's record-breaking $69 million art sale to NFT-based gaming platforms like Axie Infinity, the potential of tokenized assets is only beginning to unfold. Despite market volatility, NFTs have opened doors for creators and collectors alike.

**Blockchain Technology Beyond Finance**

Blockchain technology has applications far beyond cryptocurrency. Supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and digital identity verification are just a few industries leveraging blockchain's transparency and security. For instance, IBM and Maersk are using blockchain to streamline global trade, demonstrating its potential to reshape traditional business models.

**Challenges Facing the Crypto World**

***1. Regulatory Uncertainty:***

Governments around the globe are struggling to define clear regulations for crypto. While some nations embrace it, others, like China, have imposed strict bans. Regulatory clarity will play a pivotal role in the industry's growth.

***2. Environmental Concerns:***

The energy consumption of proof-of-work systems, particularly Bitcoin, has drawn criticism. Innovations like Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake aim to address these concerns.

***3. Scams and Security:***

The decentralized nature of crypto makes it a target for scams and hacks. Educating users and improving security measures remain priorities for the industry.

**Tools for Navigating the Crypto World**

For investors and enthusiasts, staying informed and analyzing trends is crucial. Platforms like [TradingView Premium](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/?sort=new) offer robust tools for charting, market analysis, and tracking cryptocurrency prices. With its customizable indicators and user-friendly interface, [TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/?sort=new) has become indispensable for traders seeking to understand market dynamics and develop winning strategies.

**The Future of Crypto**

The crypto world is in a constant state of flux. Emerging trends like Web3, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and the metaverse promise to push the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. As adoption grows, so does the responsibility to ensure inclusivity, security, and sustainability.

Cryptocurrency has moved beyond being a niche financial tool to a cornerstone of technological innovation. Whether you’re an investor, developer, or casual observer, the crypto world offers something for everyone. With careful navigation and an open mind, the opportunities within this evolving ecosystem are limitless."

If you do that, It will result in a transformation to the next level.**

  
**18–1-2025 19/10 Healer factor/ Transformation, Transition**

Spirit: 	18 Temptation

Soul:	1 First Emanation of Spirit; God’s number; Inspiration, Ability to lead

Body: 	25 Inner Happiness

The sum total of today is 19: Healer factor leading to Transformation. You want to heal yourself and others today through your spirit’s Temptation, your soul’s Inspiration and your physical awareness of Inner Happiness.

[Day of the 'Sorcerer' Archetype Pentagram](https://preview.redd.it/4jryn65c9qde1.jpg?width=570&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de11513fdaa59309bb536ecdc61b0967f180cc3e)

  


**Themes**

This incredible process of transformation is energized today by two major themes (axis in the pentagram). ‘Awakening -Leadership’ and  ‘Relationships’.



**Blue 11- Red 5: Axis of Awakening- Leadership: 1(0)-(6)5**

The axis of change drives the axis of inner awakening and leadership. Change- the only constant in this universe- is going to be your constant pressure to wake up and how to lead and inspire people. The two opposing principles are ‘Transformation, Transition’ coming from the “God” realm and ‘Ethics and Morality; Divine Sexuality’ coming from the “Ego” realm. It is not an easy one to fulfill with so much energy and chaos being present on this central axis. 



**10: Transformation**

Transformation is the process of the caterpillar forming a cocoon and then emerging as a butterfly. In between the two physical states everything looks like chaos. It calls for a willingness to let go of everything known and experienced, and then to be able to be born again. It is the archetypal phase of the journey of the Hero wherein he dies as an adolescent only to re-emerge an adult man. It takes you to the next level, where everything starts anew.

It gives access to the paranormal world: being clairvoyant, clairaudient and/or clairsentient. Transformation is the Holy Mother, watching over everything, holding everything. (The trap would be is to feel responsible for everything and everyone. Taking on responsibilities beyond your duty and scope). 





**65:** **’Ethics and morality; Divine Sexuality’.** 

In many cases a very strict ethical and moral attitude is connected to this number. It restricts the ability to live your sexuality without taboos and puts you in a very strict and moralistic straitjacket. The time is ripe to free yourself from these restricting thoughts and let your life-energy run freely.



The balance of these two principles lies in their sum: Awareness of Vitality; Power.  It is the desire for fulness, justice, holiness and inner order want to develop to self-awareness. It is also the energy of Dominance, Rule (Power!), Dogmatic Faith and Outer Fame. This power as such does not have to be negative. It calls for balancing it and using it for cross-fertilization.



The positive leadership coming from this central axis is to lead through vitality-change and cross-fertilization. Your whole presence radiates change. When you have full access to this axis, you lead by vitality, by charisma, by energy. Literally ‘being’ the change through energy.

On the negative side your leadership may become very manipulative.



**Red 2- Blue 8 Axis of relationships: (3)2-8(7)**

The expansion of self-awareness drives the way you relate to others and how you define your relationships. The better you know Who you are the deeper and more rewarding your relationships will be. The two opposing principles are “Divine connection”, “Wire with above”  coming from the mental level to join with “Hermaphrodite, Art and Fashion” coming from the emotional level. Mentally you have the ability to connect to the Divine in your relationships, whilst emotionally you want to feel it through the Hermaphrodite 



**32: “Divine Connection”; “Wire with the above”.**  In the Kabbalistic Life Tree there are 10 Base Principles, which are interconnected by 22 Paths. 10+22=32. “Divine Connection, Wire with the above” numerologically refers to this combination and it contains the possibility to attain spiritual Awareness. The Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal, and mysterious Ein Sof (infinity) and the mortal and finite universe (God’s creation). 



**87: “Hermaphrodite; Art and Fashion”** demands the awareness of our Androgynous essence, not to be understood in a physical sense, but in a Balance in oneself between the Masculine and the Feminine Principle. Androgynous means that we humans whether male or female always have both energies present in our bodies. Most of the times not in a 50/50 balance, but both energies are present in us nevertheless. 



The balance of the two principles lies in their sum. Show self-aware Goodness, Humility and Beauty in your relationships and root it in Femininity (being receptive and open)



**Levels of awareness**

You have high mental awareness today. Your mental awareness is obtained  by developing the Divine Connection – the Thread with Above  and developing this aura of Love and Intelligence. The goal is to bring out the intuitive divine sexuality (if you don’t you will start doubting your ‘aliveness’);  to let your healing and salvation powers expand and to bring transformative renewal and rebirth to the world.



**Triangle**

Your mental awareness is further enhanced today through the connection to the 1st and the 6th principle.



Your mental triangle in connection to the 1st principle gives you the energy of Transformational Charity, the power to Manifest your Free Will, to Expand your Femininity and to become Self-Aware of your Immortality.



Your mental (mover and shaker) triangle in connection with the 6th principle lets you Expand your being fully Awake in the Here and Now and it lets you Balance Renewal through Cross-Fertilization.

  


**Tricolon : Intermediary**

The tricolon of the intermediary is activated today. The intermediary enhances our capacity to bring people together, to keep projects going, to be the “oil in the machine”. Today it comes with the energy of Intuitive Salvation, Wise Temptation, Powerful Self-Awareness and Decisive Reformer.



**Note: If your birthday is today, the topics described above are your topics for 2025. Should a baby be born on this day, then today’s themes are the baby’s life-themes.**

Each suit possesses unique powers, drawing inspiration from some of the strongest heroes and villains across dimensions, such as the Avengers, Justice League, and their enemies. The user becomes a living armory, able to adapt to any situation with a wide range of abilities for both offense and defense

Quirk Type Emitter/Transformation

Byproducts

Suit Arsenal: The user has access to a near-infinite variety of suits, each customized for specific purposes—combat, support, reconnaissance, or even rescue operations.

Vibranium-X Armor: Each suit is forged from Vibranium-X, an enhanced version of the legendary Vibranium. It offers unparalleled durability, allowing the user to withstand most physical and energy-based attacks. This material also makes the suits highly resistant to magical and cosmic forces, ensuring their protection against a wide range of threats.

Superhuman Enhancements: When donning any suit, the user’s physical attributes are drastically increased. This includes:

Super Strength: The suits enhance the user’s strength to levels rivaling Superman and the Hulk.

Super Durability: The suits make the user impervious to most conventional weapons and resistant to extreme environmental conditions, including deep space and underwater pressures.

Super Speed and Agility: The user’s suits allow them to move at incredible speeds, rivaling speedsters like The Flash.

Enhanced Reflexes: The suits’ artificial intelligence systems assist in predicting enemy movements, increasing the user’s reaction time in combat.

Stamina Augmentation: The user can operate in extreme conditions for prolonged periods without fatigue.

Flight: Every suit comes equipped with thrusters in the feet and back, allowing the user to achieve supersonic flight speeds. Certain suits with enhanced propulsion can even reach hypersonic speeds and enter space.

Nanite Technology: Each suit is embedded with nanites that allow it to reshape and adapt on the fly. The nanites can:

Weapon Creation: The user can summon a wide array of melee and ranged weapons, from blades and hammers to energy cannons and missile launchers, based on their mental commands.

Self-Repair: If the suit is damaged, nanites automatically shift to repair the armor in real-time, ensuring minimal downtime during battles.

Reallocation: The nanites can transfer their energy and material to reinforce damaged areas, ensuring the most vulnerable parts of the suit remain functional.

Elemental Manipulation:

Flame Manipulation: Some suits grant the user control over intense flames, allowing them to create firestorms, jets of flame, or even molten weapons.

Electrokinesis: Other suits allow the user to generate and manipulate electricity. They can project electrical blasts in the form of a panther or other shapes, or use it for precision attacks.

Heat and Cold Generation: The user can generate extreme heat or freezing temperatures, creating localized environmental effects to disable opponents.

Cosmic and Magical Energy Manipulation: Certain specialized suits allow the user to tap into cosmic energy, harnessing vast amounts of power for devastating attacks.

Repulsors and Energy Blasts:

Repulsor Cannons: These powerful energy weapons are mounted on the suit’s arms, allowing the user to fire concentrated blasts capable of destroying tanks, aircraft, and heavily armored enemies.

Cluster Cannon: Combining several energy apertures on both hands and the back, the user can unleash a massive beam of energy, potent enough to obliterate entire buildings or deal heavy damage to high-end Nomus.

Unibeam: An energy beam emitted from the chest piece of the suit, capable of decimating powerful foes and structures.

Energy Redistribution: Suits can absorb incoming energy attacks and store it within the nanites. The stored energy can then be used to supercharge physical strikes, release in powerful energy waves, or redistribute to power up other abilities.

Weapon and Shield Systems: The user’s suits come equipped with a variety of combat systems, including:

Blades and Hammers: Energy or vibranium-based melee weapons that can be formed from the suit’s nanites for close-quarters combat.

Energy Shields: The user can project energy shields of varying sizes and shapes, capable of deflecting even the most powerful attacks.

Missiles and Micro Missiles: Various missile systems, from shoulder-mounted launchers to micro-missiles hidden within the suit’s compartments, can be deployed for high-precision attacks.

Rune-Infused Shield: The Asgardian long shield is engraved with defensive runes that not only block but also reflect lightning and energy attacks. It can temporarily create barriers to shield allies.

Storm Aura: Surrounds the user with a protective aura of lightning that shocks enemies who get too close, while enhancing physical attributes and agility.

The suit is etched with glowing, jagged runes across the body, symbolizing death and conquest. The helmet is adorned with long, shadowy horns that shift in appearance depending on the user’s mood or needs, emphasizing an intimidating silhouette

Ultimate Moves

Widow's Kiss: While wearing the War Widow suit, the user can transform both arms into photon particle cannons. Instead of one powerful blast, the cannons fire a rapid succession of homing photon orbs that lock onto multiple targets, destroying an entire fleet of alien ships with precision strikes. The final shot condenses the photon particles into a singular, devastating energy beam that penetrates the largest enemy vessel

Winter Missile: In the Armored Winter Soldier suit, the user creates an advanced Quad Sniper Cannon with four barrels, each loaded with explosive rounds. The rounds are coated in vibranium to pierce through any surface, and when they explode, they release a freezing shockwave that immobilizes targets before detonating in a fiery blast. The cannon is equipped with an auto-targeting system for long-range, precise assaults on multiple foes

Titan Cannon: While wearing the Armored Thanos suit, the user channels the Power Stone not just to form a photon particle cannon but to supercharge the entire arm, transforming it into a Titan Armament. This weapon releases a swirling vortex of photon energy, mixed with raw cosmic power. Upon firing, it creates a shockwave that disintegrates anything in its path, obliterating not just ships but entire planetary defenses in a single, cataclysmic shot

Quantum Barrage: Wearing the Rescue Armor, the user materializes not only multiple Quantum Energy Cannons and blades but also deploys Quantum Drones that continuously generate shields and offensive support. As the user moves through space or battle, they release an endless stream of high-energy quantum beams, attacking targets across vast distances with pinpoint accuracy while shielding themselves with phase-shifted barriers

SpeedForce Bolt: Wearing the Armored Kid Flash suit, the user generates a Tesla Lightning Gatling Cannon that fires a continuous stream of lightning bolts. Each bolt can lock onto targets and pass through solid matter with piercing precision. Additionally, the user can electrify the surrounding area, creating an energy storm that disables electronics and stuns enemies while increasing their speed exponentially

Crow Cannon: In the Armored Raven suit, the user's right arm transforms into the Crow of Oblivion Cannon, a psionic plasma cannon that not only fires magical blasts but also summons a flock of shadowy, ethereal crows. The crows distract, disorient, and attack enemies mentally, leaving them vulnerable to the cannon's powerful blasts that phase through shields and armor

American Beat Down: While wearing the Iron America suit, the user materializes Twin Gauntlet Cannons in addition to the red gauntlets. The user delivers an accelerated barrage of punches, each one charged with kinetic energy that detonates on impact. As the punches land, they create explosive shockwaves that shatter the ground, crumbling massive structures and dealing seismic damage to opponents

Gaia Cannon: In the Armored Thanos suit, the user not only charges their photon cannon with heat and energy but also absorbs power from the environment, drawing from nearby suns or stars. The resulting blast is a Solar Gaia Beam, a massive, sustained energy ray that melts through planetary crusts and causes tectonic shifts, making it more destructive than ever before

Necro Dance: Wearing the Armored Hela suit, the user summons not only necroswords but also a storm of necrotic shards that swarm and pierce enemies from all angles. These swords can follow the user's movements, creating a dance of death where the user strikes with blinding speed and precision. The necroswords can return to the user for reuse or remain embedded in targets to drain their life force

Doomsday Hammer: In the Armored Thanos suit, the user's right arm transforms into a Titan Rhino Fist with enhanced rocket propulsion. On impact, the punch generates an explosive shockwave that creates fissures in the earth, launching enemies into the air. The fist can also create an energy shield upon impact, turning defense into offense by repelling incoming attacks

Shazam's Living Lightning: While wearing the Armored Shazam suit, the user turns their right arm into the Living Lightning Blade, a dual-purpose weapon that functions as both a sword and a plasma rifle. The blade can absorb and channel ambient energy into powerful slashes, while the rifle shoots concentrated lightning bolts that paralyze and explode on contact. It can also create lightning storms in the battlefield, empowering the user’s strikes

Proton Rifle: In the Armored Fury suit, the user forms a Proton Energy Sniper Rifle instead of a standard rifle. This long-range weapon charges and fires proton beams that travel through matter and shields, causing devastating energy disintegration on impact. The rifle also has a secondary mode, firing smaller, rapid proton shots for crowd control

Shield Bombardment: While wearing the Armored Fury suit, the user doesn’t just create shoulder-mounted missile launchers but also deploys Drone Shield Carriers that form an autonomous perimeter around the user. These drones carpet-bomb the battlefield with precision-guided missile strikes, and the shoulder-mounted cannons simultaneously unleash energy bombardments that cause wid"
How I reached 1M networth through CRYPTO,phinvest,1i3vsbx,2025-01-17 19:59:45,0,0.34,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1i3vsbx/how_i_reached_1m_networth_through_crypto/,r_nb,Cryptocurrency,"2017 nung first time ko bumili ng BTC. Nahikayat ng officemate bumili sa [coins.ph](http://coins.ph) kasi daily daw lumalaki value ng pera nya. During this time, wala pa ako idea how it works kahit yung concept ng supply and demand. Basta alam ko lumalaki and lumiliit yung value. Natuto din ako mag Binance and started buying other coins. Ito yung time na yung Binance app is wala pa sa playstore/appstore and parang frequently nag eexpire yung certificate nya so need mo lagi ireinstall using yung download link. So in my mind, parang naiisip ko na illegal ba to? So di ko masyado nagpay attention. Then one day, nagdump yung market and I sold all of my coins. Wala pang P2P nung time na to and via [Coins.ph](http://Coins.ph) pa lang yung cashout. Less than 50k lang nainvest ko in total so di ko masyado inisip and just moved on with my life.

Next exposure ko sa crypto is Axie (2021, 4 years later). May extra money so bumuli ng axie. Ito yung first exposure ko sa spot trading by buying/selling axs and slp. Nung nawala na yung hype ng axie and sobrang mura ng mga axies I got lucky na yung iba kong axies ay useful pa din sa V3 nung game nila. And I was able to sell some for 5 digits. In the end naging profitable naman ako sa axie.

Pumasok din ako sa Pegaxy (another nft game like Axie), and dito ako nalugi. Late na ako ng pasok tapos di pa nag TP. Then SOL NFTs trading naman sa Magic Eden. Nagprofit, then nalugi din (di ulit nag TP on time). Yung mga biggest holdings ko nag-rugpull, around 50k din yung loss. Around 100k profit sana nung peak ng NFTs.

Ito naman yung first exposure ko sa leveraged trading. Ma profitable days pero mostly loss. I do scalping with high leverage. This did not work for me. Sobrang stressful and lagi ako nakatingin sa charts. During my first liquidation event I lost 600$. Grabe nanlambot yung tuhod ko. Literal na napaupo ako nung nakita kong nagdump yung chart haha

Wala along stable work nito. I do a little bit of buy and sell and freelance work pero hindi enough. There was a time na we're down to my last 20k.

Then the Luna crash and FTX fiasco happened. The whole market dumped and that's when I stopped. During this time may work ako na okay naman yung pay so grind ulit sa work. Di na ako nag actively invest ulit pero lagi ako sumisilip sa market. Umabot ng 15$ si SOL pero di ako bumili. Now it's 219$.

During the end of 2023, meron akong nakitang post about as airdrop ng PYTH (this is a solana coin). I never imagined na eligible ako pero triny ko pa rin check. To my surprise, meron along around 4000 coins na allocation. How and why? Because of my solana NFT trading. I sold my allocation for 35k but if I sold it at peak 100k sana. During this time, nagreversal na yung market and I decided to trade again. Tapos sunod sunod na rin yung natanggap ko na airdrops.

This past year I received airdrops from $JUP, $KMNO, $DRIFT, $WEN, $CLOUD, $ME, $GRASS, $PENGU. All in all, siguro around 250k PHP lahat lahat. All of this is because I use their platforms and solana

Around August last year ako nagseryoso sa futures trading. I used the money I received from airdrops. I studied more about trading and found the strategy that worked for me. This time hindi na ako nagscalping. Instead, I do swing trading relying on HTF key levels/reversals. Less stressful and di ako masyado nagspspend ng maraming time trading. I just check the charts from time to time. October, November and December are my most profitable months that allowed me to reach 1M net worth.

So that's almost 7 years in crypto before I could say na profitable ako. I am now confident in my skills/knowledge about crypto and hopefully masustain ko in the coming years."
The Hidden Layers of the Crypto World: Beyond the Buzz,TradingElite,1i3pxhn,2025-01-17 15:29:49,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1i3pxhn/the_hidden_layers_of_the_crypto_world_beyond_the/,Maylights,,"Cryptocurrency has grown far beyond its original purpose as a digital payment method. While Bitcoin remains a household name, the crypto world is a constantly evolving ecosystem filled with innovation, controversy, and opportunity. Let's explore some lesser-known facets of this dynamic universe.

**The Rise of Tokenized Real-World Assets**

One of the most fascinating developments in crypto is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). From real estate and fine art to luxury cars and stocks, almost anything of value can now be represented as a blockchain token.

Tokenization allows fractional ownership, meaning you don’t need millions to own a piece of a Picasso painting or a Manhattan skyscraper. Platforms like RealT and Securitize are making RWAs more accessible, democratizing investments for people worldwide.

**DAOs: The Future of Governance**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are reshaping how communities operate. A DAO functions like a company but without traditional hierarchies. Instead, decisions are made collectively by token holders through blockchain-based voting.

For example, DAOs are managing everything from charity funds to gaming guilds. Projects like Uniswap and MakerDAO rely on this model to empower their users, creating a new era of decentralized governance.

**Layer 2 Scaling: The Backbone of Crypto's Future**

As the adoption of cryptocurrencies grows, so does the need for faster and cheaper transactions. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and the Lightning Network are critical for scaling major blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

These technologies offload transaction data from the main blockchain, reducing congestion and fees while maintaining security. They’re paving the way for mass adoption, making crypto transactions as seamless as swiping a credit card.

**Gaming and the Metaverse: Crypto’s New Frontier**

The intersection of gaming, blockchain, and the metaverse is revolutionizing entertainment. Play-to-earn (P2E) games like Axie Infinity and Sandbox allow players to earn cryptocurrencies and NFTs by playing games.

In these virtual worlds, players own their in-game assets, which can be sold or traded for real money. This blend of gaming and finance creates new economic opportunities, particularly for users in developing countries.

**Privacy Coins: The Double-Edged Sword**

While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, privacy coins like Monero and Zcash take anonymity to the next level. These coins use advanced cryptography to obscure transaction details, providing greater privacy for users.

However, privacy coins face regulatory scrutiny, as they’re often associated with illegal activities. Balancing user privacy and regulatory compliance remains a contentious issue in the crypto space.

**TradingView: A Must-Have for Crypto Enthusiasts**

Amid this rapidly evolving landscape, tools like [TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/?sort=new) are essential for navigating the crypto world. Known for its intuitive charts and indicators, [TradingView ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/?sort=new)is a favorite among traders. It also hosts a vibrant community where users share trading ideas and strategies.

For crypto traders,[ TradingView’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/?sort=new) integration with multiple exchanges and customizable alerts can be a game-changer. Whether you're tracking Bitcoin’s price or analyzing a lesser-known altcoin, TradingView ensures you stay informed and ready to act.

**The Challenges Ahead**

Despite its growth, the crypto world faces significant challenges. Regulatory uncertainty, environmental concerns over energy-intensive mining, and the potential for market manipulation continue to cast shadows over the industry.

However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation. Solutions like proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms and blockchain transparency tools aim to address these concerns, making the industry more sustainable and trustworthy.

The crypto world is a blend of promise and complexity. From groundbreaking innovations like tokenized assets and DAOs to challenges like regulation and scalability, it’s a space that never stands still. For investors, developers, and enthusiasts, the journey through the crypto universe is just beginning."
"All of the so called premium cryptocurrency related video games have either failed, are blatant scams, or are dead... Off the Grid now included.",CryptoCurrency,1i3mb2n,2025-01-17 12:54:24,68,0.82,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i3mb2n/all_of_the_so_called_premium_cryptocurrency/,Ryanopoly,DISCUSSION,"We all know the story of Axie Infinity by now, but it along with CryptoKitties were among the first of the pointless get rich quick crypto related video games to emerge from the depths of greed back during the first and second legendary cryptocurrency bull runs of 2017 and 2021.

Fast forward to today, and we have titles such as Off the Grid, Shrapnel, Illuvium, and Star Atlas, all dead or still scamming... you tell me?

I was doing some research before typing this crap up and the story seems to follow a lot of the old patterns. Developers and mediocre people leave their cushy jobs at big technology companies in search of riches in the cryptocurrency space, giving themselves ridiculous titles on LinkedIn to make you think they are something more than they are.

They all seem to get the whitepaper out, or at least that is what we used to call it, then ask everyone to purchase the in-game currency, or some non-fungible tokens to help ""fund"" their projects, and then later try to sell all of the tokens they created out of thin air before anyone else figures it out, and then leaves the company to go start another scam clone project to rinse and repeat.

In the case of Off the Grid, they paid a bunch of money to get idiots like Ninja and a bunch of other so called ""influencers"" to play the game, and then as soon as the money ran out, all of them went back to Fortnite. Heck, the Off the Grid team even created a Ninja skin, and the guy still dropped them like a bad habit as soon as his obligation to play the game was over... pretty sad eh?

[Check out that FTX US sponsorship! 😂](https://preview.redd.it/991w5s3q7lde1.jpg?width=1717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e4ed800c49b0cd16c85c367f32a78a87ab4087b)

Then there's this little gem above which I thought was hilarious, especially considering who was sponsoring him. I came across this video when I was researching, and the channel is obviously a Fugazzi as well. There's no way you have 1.05 million subscribers without a verification checkmark, and after 2 years your video only has 7.5 thousand views... seems a little suspicious don't you think?

Anyway, the gist of the video is that the game is hard, kind of sucks, and probably shouldn't exist, although he obviously couldn't outright say any of this, due to the possibility of being paid to shill this crap of a video game on his crappy YouTube channel.

As far as the Star Atlas game by Atlas Space is concerned, it's just a complete rip off of another questionable game called Star Citizen. Both rely on the greater whale theory which involves incels who want to own the biggest ship in order to compensate for something.

In the end, neither game will actually materialize into something worth playing or being playable at all, and all the money these fools spent on ships and in-game items will just go to the smart scammers who promised them something for all these years... pretty genius when you really think about it actually.

With all that being said it begs the ultimate question... will a good cryptocurrency video game ever exist?"

My Love For You,UnsentLetters,1i3hyj2,2025-01-17 09:48:17,7,0.9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i3hyj2/my_love_for_you/,Haaail_Sagan,Lovers,"I wish love could be shown as a physical object. I think the size and nature of mine would surprise anyone who saw it. If everyone's love was a tangible thing, like a gem, or a cup, my love for you would be an infinite garden, with the most beautiful trees and flowers never before seen on earth. The waterfalls would crash in the most beautiful symphonies, songs you couldn't place and felt more like angels singing than music you'd ever heard before. 

It would be enclosed in mossy stone, and my love for you would have a cottage in the center; smoke pouring from the chimney all night and day. 

If you entered, you'd see a simple place, but a warm one just the same. Fresh bread on the wooden table, bowls of fruit.  Fat fish freshly caught turning over the fire. The walls would be lined everywhere possible with every book we've ever loved, and the bed would be a cushioned pile of furs. My kind of heaven. Yours, too, I know.  

Where most love, if made physical, would fit in the palm of ones hand, mine for you would stretch off into infinity in every direction, mazes of gardens bursting with the most vibrant colors.  Fat, lazy honey bees would be busy making honey for our mead, and everything we'd ever need would grow or live nearby. 

I want to be isolated with you for a time. Show you around the garden that grew up around my love for you over the years.  How rainy and dark it's grown since you and I had to go our separate ways.  Oh,  please..  you owe me nothing, but please come back and help the sun shine again! You were the only source of light, and the birds miss you terribly.  

I wish you could lay there by the fire with me, reading to each other and ourselves in quiet twilight and laughing and sharing all the things that happened during the lost years. A hammock, stretched between two silver trees, would be perfect for napping tangled up together, swaying in the breeze. Growing in the swaying trees, 'the silver apples of the moon/The golden apples of the sun'.  

I come here, to this sacred place inside me, to love you in secret.  I've done it for so long.. decades.  My entire adult life. I've tried so hard to stop, J. There was guilt in the beginning, when we were both married, then I left, in truth, because my love for you showed me I could never stay in such a toxic marriage. Not when I knew it could be kind, and soft, and beautifully obsessive. Like you were oxygen, and I was breathing for the first time. 

When I left, I could love you as freely as I wanted, and its lasted decades.  I didn't have to give it any thought.  In truth, any time I did, I realized there was just no way to stop loving you.  I wish there was a way to understand why this is happening, why I've been caught in this net since I first laid eyes on you.  Even though it was friendly for so many years.  I could never forget you.  No matter the proximity or distance, you are hopelessly lodged in my heart.

Maybe we are, in another life, living there together. Yes.. that feels right.  I can feel it in my soul.. in this other life, we are drinking beer, fishing the river for our dinner, and laughing that we could ever be apart in another life. But it's not funny here.  Here, it just hurts. It hurts, and leaves me empty at my center. This place inside  me, whether or not I like it, was created at the beginning of time to fit you. 

I'll just stay in this place in my mind, waiting for you to come back.  The Mist by the river is heavy, silky & smooth. I have cold beer and good conversation just waiting for when you come home to my heart.

Pros
	1.	Community Building: Having a dedicated token could make it easier to promote the DApp and build a loyal community around it.
	2.	Easier Ecosystem Growth: A utility coin might attract crypto enthusiasts who enjoy token-based ecosystems, similar to how Axie Infinity’s token model worked to foster engagement.
