Meine Bitcoin-Position möchte ich niemals verkaufen; vielmehr möchte ich die Gewinne aus den Altcoins im nächsten Bärenmarkt in Bitcoin reinstecken.

Elrond/ERD-D06 tokens in Atomic irretrievable?,atomicwallet,1hq30ac,2024-12-30 20:14:10,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/atomicwallet/comments/1hq30ac/elronderdd06_tokens_in_atomic_irretrievable/,KiwiSlaver,atomicswap,"I have a few thousand ERD-D06 (unsure if it's Elrond or MultiversX/EGLD) tokens in my Atomic Wallet worth $0.00, which I bought on the BNB Smart Chain. According to Atomic Support, the ""BNB Chain has been shut down since December 3, 2024"", which is probably why their value is now $0.00.

I was advised to ""import your backup phrase from Atomic Wallet into Trust Wallet, access your BNB BEP2 from there and try using the token recovery dApp"". I attempted this (it involves downloading a Trust extension to Chrome). but it didn't seem to install properly. 

Furthermore, apparently ""only the crosschain **bound**/mirrored assets can be recovered"" and according to [https://github.com/bnb-chain/bcfusion](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bcfusion) ERD-D06	tokens have a ""Bind Status"" of ""No"".

So is that it? These tokens are lost forever? No way to transfer/migrate/convert?

Que pensez vous de mes investissements ? (2ans d'expérience),VosSous,1hows6y,2024-12-29 09:12:27,65,0.86,97,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hows6y,Most_Dope_7,,"Pour vous donner un peu de contexte. Je suis un jeune homme de 21 ans.

J'ai hérité il y a 2 ans de ça d'une jolie somme de départ de 8000€ de mes parents qui aurait dû servir à payer mes études. Ayant suivi une formation en alternance, mon patron et les aides d'États  s'en sont chargés.

Je sais la valeur de cet argent et les sacrifices que mes parents ont fait pour me l'offrir. J'ai donc fait mes devoirs et je me suis éduqué aux b.a.-ba de l'investissement à long terme avant de le placer.
 
J'ai choisi d'investir cette somme initiale en crypto-monnaies (bitcoin et ethereum et marginalement dans quelques autres projets) et en bourse, uniquement via des etf sur PEA.
Depuis je réalimente occasionnellement ces comptes avec mes revenues.

Comme beaucoup de français, je viens d'un milieu sans éducation financière. Ma famille place son argent dans un livret A et éventuellement dans une assurance vie aux contenus opaque proposé par leur banque. Comme cela fait 2 ans que je fais ça et que ces investissements sont les résultats de mes propres décisions prises suite à mes recherches, je me dis que ce sera le bons moments de les partager pour avoir un avis extérieur.

Pour que vous ayez une idée de mes finances dans leur ensemble, je précise que s'ajoute à ces comptes ~1500€ sur un compte courant, ~6000€ d'économies de réserves sur un livret A ainsi que ~2500€ sur le PEA en ordre ou non investi.

Cryptocurrencies transact in terms of smallest recordable units. These are their non-divisible base units, and represent the **total finite supply**. **In layman's terms: one can not send or sell 1/2 Satoshi, or any other chains coin smallest unit to another party.** 

The true rarity of a currency is based on these non-divisible base units.  The table is showing **apples** for **apples** supply in **order of rarity**, once decimal places are adjusted (blue highlighted column)."

Crypto 2025,Crypto_com,1h2tvw1,2024-11-29 14:36:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/comments/1h2tvw1/crypto_2025/,Huariubro,General Discussion 💬,"Hello everyone, this is Bogdan here, a 40 year old Romanian that lost almost everything I’ve saved in the last 10 years on the well, beautiful and in the same time promising back then, project from Terra  and the well known Do Kown, #LUNA. Now that I have learned my lesson at a big cost, I want to share with you what I know about some other projects, and I’ll never make the same mistake again, putting almost all my savings on one project. So here’s what you need to know:

$EGLD will start slowly but surely an up trend, I personally know a few Romanian people that got rich last bull run with Elrond, now know as MultiversX, and I know for sure others want this too, and the project got better and BETTER during this bear market that we all wanted to end sooner, even Romanian authorities started a partnership with the developers of MultiversX, Mincu Brothers. So check it if you don’t heard about it.

$FET also an AI project that got a lill hate due to the merge process between $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX which all should have been named as ASI (Artificial Superintelligence Alliance)but it supposed to happen in phase 2, but I still believe this was not even the beginning, though X influencers like CryptoWizardd moved to promote other projects, and $FET is no more in the spotlight, and if I think again actually I’m sure a better opportunity for poorly people like me wouldn’t be possible in the near future. So keep an eye open on this project, 6 or 7 dollars for one FET is not a dream, it’s a fact.

$SOL I also believe it will make another ATH, for this I don’t have to explain why, I’m sure everyone that owns a few coins knows, it is what it is

And there are few coins that deserve attention like:
$ROSE, $CHZ, $INJ, $WOO, $SUI, $ICP and more. 

What do you think about this?"

Does EGLD have good tokenomics?,cryptoQandA,1gnd8c5,2024-11-09 11:01:18,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1gnd8c5/does_egld_have_good_tokenomics/,maxikaz19,,"## Overview of EGLD Tokenomics 

EGLD, the native token of the MultiversX blockchain (formerly known as Elrond), has garnered attention for its unique economic model and potential for growth. Understanding its tokenomics is essential for investors and users who wish to engage with this cryptocurrency effectively. This article explores the key aspects of EGLD's tokenomics, including its supply dynamics, utility, governance, and market performance.

## Supply Dynamics of EGLD

EGLD's supply structure is designed to create scarcity and value retention:

* **Total Supply**: The total supply of EGLD is capped at approximately **31.4 million tokens**, significantly reduced from its original 20 billion ERD tokens through a token swap that occurred in September 2020.
* **Initial Minting**: Initially, 20 million EGLD tokens were minted, with a gradual inflation mechanism set to introduce new tokens over ten years. This inflation is controlled by the network's transaction fees, which can offset the newly minted tokens.
* **Scarcity Mechanism**: The limited maximum supply and the gradual introduction of new tokens create a scarcity effect that can enhance EGLD's value as demand increases.

## Utility of EGLD

EGLD serves multiple purposes within the MultiversX ecosystem:

* **Transaction Fees**: Users pay fees in EGLD for transactions and smart contract executions on the network.
* **Staking Rewards**: EGLD holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards while contributing to network security. This incentivizes long-term holding rather than immediate selling.
* **Governance Participation**: EGLD holders have voting rights on key decisions affecting the network's development and governance.

### Economic Incentives

The economic incentives embedded in EGLD's tokenomics encourage user participation and ecosystem growth:

* **Staking Mechanism**: The ability to earn rewards through staking promotes a culture of holding among investors, reducing market volatility.
* **Ecosystem Development**: MultiversX supports various projects, including DeFi applications and NFT marketplaces, increasing the demand for EGLD as more users engage with these services.
* **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: As MultiversX develops cross-chain capabilities, it enhances interoperability with other blockchain networks, attracting more users and developers.

### Governance Structure

EGLD's governance model emphasizes community involvement:

* **Decentralized Decision-Making**: Token holders can vote on proposals that shape the network's future, ensuring that decisions reflect community interests.
* **Transparency**: The governance process is designed to be transparent, fostering trust among participants.

### Market Performance

EGLD has demonstrated impressive market performance since its launch:

* **Price History**: Initially priced at $0.65 during its ICO in July 2019, EGLD has reached all-time highs above $28.85. This price appreciation indicates strong market confidence in its underlying technology and economic model.
* **Investor Interest**: Backing from notable investors has further legitimized EGLD as a viable investment opportunity within the cryptocurrency space.

## Where to Buy EGLD

For those interested in purchasing EGLD, [**BINANCE**](https://cryptosacro.top/go/BINANCE)
 is an excellent platform to consider. BINANCE offers a user-friendly interface for buying and trading EGLD with various trading pairs. Here’s how you can buy EGLD on BINANCE:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up on BINANCE’s website or app.
2. **Deposit Funds**: Fund your account using your preferred payment method.
3. **Select Trading Pair**: Navigate to the spot trading section and select the EGLD/USDT pair.
4. **Place Your Order**: Choose between a limit order or market order based on your trading strategy.

BINANCE provides competitive fees and a secure environment for trading cryptocurrencies, making it an ideal choice for both new and experienced investors.

### Challenges to Consider

While EGLD's tokenomics presents several strengths, there are challenges:

* **Market Competition**: The blockchain space is highly competitive, with established players like Ethereum and newer entrants like Solana.
* **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies could impact how EGLD operates or is perceived by investors.
* **Adoption Rates**: The success of EGLD largely depends on user adoption and developer engagement within its ecosystem.

### Evaluating EGLD's Tokenomics

In conclusion, EGLD exhibits several characteristics that suggest it has strong tokenomics:

1. **Controlled Supply Dynamics**: The capped maximum supply combined with an inflation offset mechanism promotes scarcity.
2. **Versatile Utility**: Its use cases extend beyond mere transactions; it serves as a medium for staking rewards and governance participation.
3. **Economic Incentives for Growth**: Staking mechanisms and ecosystem development initiatives encourage long-term holding among investors.
4. **Robust Governance Model**: Decentralized governance fosters community engagement and trust.

Overall, if MultiversX continues to innovate while fostering community involvement through effective governance structures, EGLD's tokenomics could position it favorably within the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.

What is the Best approach to maximizing profits for my EGLD tokens. ,elrondnetwork,1glljc4,2024-11-07 03:03:16,7,0.77,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/elrondnetwork/comments/1glljc4/what_is_the_best_approach_to_maximizing_profits/,minibuddy0,Announcements,"What is the right approach to crypto projects immediately or even long after they list, does the approach change with different factors like the time they list or in the case they do well or they don't.   
  
For context, I still hold my MultiversX tokens (EGLD) and I am considering staking it on Bitget since the APR is up to 8.5%.   
Is staking the best option considering volatility? I am inclined to staking since it seems the safest and stable method compared to other profitable options i was introduced to.   
  
I also feel this is safer since many people have predicted that we could hit the bull-run any moment. Anyway I'd like to know if i made the right choice and if there are other options I can consider."

Low-Cap Cryptocurrencies Set To Explode In Late 2024 PART 3,CapitalistExploits,1fkjyvj,2024-09-19 08:46:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1fkjyvj/lowcap_cryptocurrencies_set_to_explode_in_late/,kayakero,,">

2. 5th Scape (5SCAPE)
3. JUP (JUP)
4. Seedify.fund (SFUND)
5. Zilliga (ZIL)

Let's go with our last choices.

# Low-Cap Cryptocurrencies Set To Explode In Late 2024

**Veracity (VRA)**

https://preview.redd.it/j9ll5at1irpd1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b68280365904b46b7a9692b50d0bf05b13c7103

Verasity is a protocol that brings a breath of fresh air to the cryptocurrency industry, thanks to its unique Proof of View consensus mechanism. This project is designed to address the problems of video advertising and NFT-related scams.

This platform helps verify the authenticity of every content view using AI, transparency, and immutability. Its cutting-edge technology offers a fraud-free environment for advertisers and content providers, and its main applications are in esports, video entertainment, and digital content development.

The Verasity ecosystem is governed by the VRA token. With a peak price of $0.08621, VRA has demonstrated its potential for value growth. Currently, the market cap of Verasity is over $30 million, and its current price is well below the ATH. However, investor interest is maintained thanks to Verasity’s inventive strategy. According to analysts, the price of VRA could reach $0.0299 by the end of 2025 if the planned developments are realized.

**MultiversX ($EGLD)**

https://preview.redd.it/8anckdb4irpd1.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=52386034687454755f01c711dc367a3555a53231

MultiversX’s blockchain protocol (formerly known as Elrond) uses sharding technology to deliver incredibly fast transaction speeds. This blockchain includes fintech, DeFi, and IoT solutions, in a more eco-friendly way than its main competitors: Solana and Ethereum.

The company can reportedly handle 15,000 transactions in one second on its smart contract execution platform. It charges $0.001 per transaction with a latency of six seconds.

MultiversX rewards active users with EGLD tokens, its native cryptocurrency. It is a very solid cryptocurrency, with more than 5 consecutive years in the top 100 coins by market capitalization, and although it has surpassed the billion dollar mark several times, even reaching $9 billion, today it has a capitalization just over $900 million, waiting for its next bull run.

**Flux (FLUX)**

https://preview.redd.it/8fscghtwhrpd1.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b27dbc3d8ff62151980790c343bc549fe0bcf7c

Flux is a blockchain network that encompasses a series of nodes and technologies that operate on the POW protocol. The Flux ecosystem consists of a native, mineable POW cryptocurrency (FLUX), a powerful decentralized computational network Flux Network (FluxNodes), a Linux-based operating system (FluxOS), a digital asset platform (Zelcore), and finally, the Flux blockchain for governance, parallel economics and assets to provide interoperability with other blockchains and DeFi access.

FLUX can be used for a variety of things, including funding FluxOS transactions, collateralizing nodes, and purchasing resources. It can also be used to pay both miners and FluxNode operators for providing computing power.

The Flux ecosystem is dedicated to making it possible for everyone to design, deploy, and use the future Web3 decentralized network. Currently, FLUX has a low market cap of around $200 million, and its price has grown by 30% over the past year, causing good feelings among its users.

**TEDDY (TED)**

https://preview.redd.it/xqobrb9jhrpd1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ce4374731c0e8c1c8c3f003f77830c6e1ada31

Under 200K market cap, it is a high risk-high reward investment. According to $TED's team:

Truly Open Finance: xExchange V3 is Here,MultiversXOfficial,1fgqsbp,2024-09-14 13:02:39,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiversXOfficial/comments/1fgqsbp/truly_open_finance_xexchange_v3_is_here/,AxedLens1,Announcements,"DeFi has been great at widening access to financial services and laying the groundwork for an alternative system. However, UX challenges, such as complex onboarding, confusing jargon, and clunky interfaces, have hindered its broader appeal. 

[xExchange V3](https://preview.redd.it/wz8begny2tod1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b1750c14b45976a249dfc241440f07c650f377)

The current DeFi user experience dilemma is a hindrance in the way towards truly effective, accessible and inclusive Open Finance. To achieve mainstream relevance, protocols must simplify workflows, making them accessible to a wider audience and moving past bloated interfaces that characterize Web3 finance nowadays.

xExchange V3 seeks to solve this problem by offering a radically intuitive platform where users can engage with DeFi easily, regardless of technical expertise or prior knowledge. All while giving builders the blocks required to further expand the infrastructure for next-gen Web3 financial products.

# What’s New?

This upgrade brings significant improvements in user experience, trading capabilities, and liquidity provision, positioning xExchange as a more efficient and powerful platform for both new and experienced users.

Let's dive a little deeper into these three main areas brought by xExchange V3:

# New Trading Experience

[xexchange.com](https://preview.redd.it/t84l3qb03tod1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a6e9132616bc6d08a318f6353df1f4c9983087e)

**Price Charts**

* Introduced detailed price charts for both tokens and pools.
* Added advanced candlestick charts via TradingView with multiple time resolutions.

**Frictionless Value Exchange**

* Swap page renamed to “Trade” for easier understanding.
* Removed the need for separate ""wrap/unwrap"" EGLD transactions.
* Simplified trade form by removing unnecessary categories (Community, Ecosystem, Core).
* Trade form inputs remain even after login/logout or changing token pairs.

**Shareable Trade Links**

* URLs now capture trade form inputs, enabling easy sharing of specific trade setups.

# Liquidity Enhancements

https://preview.redd.it/r3iulwx23tod1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=62f8feca8f63b26db07e737c289751b386299092

**1-Click Liquidity Creator**

* Simplified liquidity provision process, reducing the number of steps from requiring multiple transactions to just one.

**xExchange Liquidity Fund**

* Introduced a fund to incentivize liquidity by providing loans for liquidity pools and development grants.
* Focused on enhancing liquidity and supporting projects through funding and liquidity incentives
   * For projects outside MultiversX, xExchange would provide 100% of the MEX.
   * For MultiversX projects, xExchange would provide 80% of the MEX.

**Boosted Staking & Dual Farms**

* “Metastaking” split into two concepts: “Dual Farm” (LP token) and “Staking” (single token).
* Boosted rewards for staking and dual farming (up to 2.33x more rewards).

# UI/UX Upgrades

https://preview.redd.it/pq2dxn843tod1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=16453f8c3bdb4dabc56d6b974f6384041f858cd4

Section IV.M.2.a.lvi: MultiversX (Elrond) (EGLD)  
  
Trend Following Analysis of MultiversX (EGLD) in the Cryptocurrency Sector  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into the trend following dynamics of MultiversX (EGLD), a blockchain platform known for its scalability through sharding technology and its native cryptocurrency, EGLD. By examining market performance, technological developments, and community sentiment as reflected in real-time X posts, this study aims to provide insights into how EGLD aligns with broader cryptocurrency trends. We explore the impact of MultiversX's technological advancements, such as its Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus mechanism and parallel processing capabilities, on its market position. Additionally, the analysis incorporates EGLD's price movements, trading volumes, and investor sentiment to understand its trend following behavior within the volatile crypto market. Through a combination of technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and social media engagement, this abstract sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of how MultiversX navigates and potentially leads trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering valuable insights for investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike.

Could someone please help me understand why I am unable to unstake my EGLD?  I am using the Chrome extension wallet and initiated the unstake transaction.  I read that it would take around 10 days to complete.  So, I came back today, a month later, and the unstaked balance is now called 'Pending Unstake'?  Then I read that I must do a second thing, I believe it is called claiming, to finalize the unstake process?  However, I cannot see anything more that can be done in this wallet.  Can someone help me understand what needs to be done here?  Thank you all in advance."

MultiversX Directly Available Through MetaMask: Fastest Lane to the Ecosystem,MultiversXOfficial,1eo6p14,2024-08-09 14:09:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiversXOfficial/comments/1eo6p14/multiversx_directly_available_through_metamask/,AxedLens1,Announcements,"MetaMask was the first truly functional product of its kind. It rapidly became the wallet of choice when it comes to Ethereum and proxy ecosystems.  

[MultiversX Snap in Metamask](https://preview.redd.it/r196o655iohd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9ab288ad68503900475d9d69a21e624a2774f4)

Today, we're publicly releasing MultiversX Snap, an audited add-on that MetaMask users can install for the most frictionless way to access ecosystem products, network innovations, and protocol advantages in terms of general user experience.

MetaMask Snaps greatly improve portability, enabling the quick derivation of a MultiversX wallet from your existing seed phrase with just a few confirmation steps. That means near-instant onboarding without yet another backup wallet. Soon enough, you will be able to interact with most of the dApps on MultiversX directly from your MetaMask wallet as ecosystem builders gradually integrate it. You can get it from any ecosystem app supporting Metamask by just connecting to it.

**POV: MetaMask user, new to MultiversX** 

https://preview.redd.it/8tyw6747iohd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=651c1f3cf1ae3ff8bde6e7f2c437ac2846e00386

If you are not familiar with MultiversX, it's about time to get in the know! You likely know the drill when it comes to new-generation blockchains: fast, cheap, and overall slightly better across the board.

That's what we call, at best, optimizations. We are building for the greater good of crypto, with a strong belief that the work laid down today is the foundation of tomorrow (read as decades).

One pain point that we think is a big blocker for the mass adoption of this amazing technology is user safety. On MultiversX, tokens aren’t logs in smart contract records, but native assets with the same operating flow as EGLD, the native network coin. To put it differently, if you ever receive an airdrop on MultiversX, you don't have to be afraid to interact with the tokens because draining concerns are a thing of the past here.

While making token interactions safe is a must for the future of tokenization, this is just one side of the story. We’ve also made wallets unbreakable to protect users from phishing attempts with an on-chain 2FA solution. With the MultiversX Snap, you can start setting one up immediately.

‍**POV: EVM developer, MuliversX curious**

https://preview.redd.it/zwdt37x8iohd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c928ad7b8332654db444d108f14d210511e8b485

First, we’ve put together an [**interactive tutorial**](https://interactive-tutorials.multiversx.com/dashboard/iframe-provider) with the basics of the MultiversX Snap. Developers can play around with it to get started and follow with the [**integration docs**](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/sdk-js-signing-providers/#the-metamask-proxy-provider).

If you've been around the Ethereum landscape, you’ve likely heard (and know) a few things about Sharding. No, it didn’t get lost on research forums. It’s here and live, on MultiversX. The past few years of performance inconsistencies, fee spikes to hundreds of dollars or fragmentation through subpar solutions have proven that (full) sharding is not just something that’s nice to have, it’s an absolute must.

Other noteworthy benefits to developing on MultiversX:

* Integrated mobile distribution via [xPortal](https://xportal.com/)
* [Royalties](https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/built-in-functions/#claimdeveloperrewards): 30% SC gas returned to SC authors
* [WASM-based VM](https://docs.multiversx.com/learn/space-vm/): fastest in the space
* [Tokens ](https://docs.multiversx.com/tokens/fungible-tokens)(FT, SFT, NFT) natively embedded into the protocol
* Consistent UX thanks to [horizontal scalability](https://docs.multiversx.com/learn/sharding)
* [Sovereign Chains](https://docs.multiversx.com/sovereign/overview/) for specialized and complex apps
* [Builders Hub](https://multiversx.com/builders-hub): tool and resource maturity

Take the leap and let’s build the future on-chain!

Ben's scaling law: the sharding imperative,MultiversXOfficial,1e3teah,2024-07-15 08:20:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiversXOfficial/comments/1e3teah/bens_scaling_law_the_sharding_imperative/,AxedLens1,Announcements,"Let there be a fundamental principle we call Ben's scaling law:  
  
Any sufficiently advanced and scalable system — whether in nature, society, or computation — must by necessity, be sharded.  
  
Conversely, any non-sharded system is bound to break down and fade into irrelevance.🧵 

[Ben's scaling law](https://preview.redd.it/dk8k6esjcocd1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c770cd40414b4b347a612c44bf4ade464459e35)

Blockchains are but an inescapable reinforcement of this broader general principle.  
  
To claim scaling without parallelization is to be confined to an intellectual flat earth, failing to grasp the unavoidable limitations of one's own absurd assumption. 

All blockchain architectures — Irrespective of their professed marketing positions — will unquestionably have to face this simple yet shattering realization:  
  
\*Without sharding, all blockchains are broken and dead.\* 

This marks the first great filter that guards and unlocks the possibility of a major tipping point in adoption.  
  
A necessary step for opening a global, positive sum, multi-trillion dollar, multifaceted societal game, with the highest systemic impact for humanity. 

Seen in this new light, all incremental and monolithic scaling methods are but a brief shadow, ultimately doomed and incapable of passing the first great filter.  
  
Thus, on a practical level, ""no sharding"" theories and marketing are as useful as ""flat earth"" theories and marketing.  
  
Intellectual gibberish. Destined to be forgotten. With only a brief flicker in the meantime. 

To be sure, there are both synchronous and asynchronous sharding methods.  
  
In fact, MultiversX's architecture is the first blockchain using a dynamically adaptive sharding method globally in production.  
  
This alone has been an extraordinary milestone, considered nearly impossible before actually being achieved.  
  
Being the most advanced, scalable and secure Layer 1 blockchain in the world, positions MultiversX at the epicenter of the next growth wave.

[multiversx.com](http://multiversx.com)

But there's more.  
  
After 5 years of intense effort at MultiversX, we've now introduced an asynchronous sharding method. Expanding on the initial breakthrough, we have created the basis of a heterogeneous supernetwork with maximum performance, security and customizability.  
  
This new layer we call Sovereign Chains.  
  
This is designed to take the cornerstone MultiversX advancements, and enable a new interoperability and acceleration layer, for all the largest chains and ecosystems in the world to tap into.  
  
Thus, the Sovereign Chain module enables unmatched performance, robust security, rich flexibility, simple deployment, and independent setup.  
  
It creates a new game for the biggest ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana.  
  
But even more specifically for builders, looking for top performance and security, combined with strategic interoperability with specific ecosystems and communities.

[multiversx.com/sovereign-chains](http://multiversx.com/sovereign-chains)

Sovereign Chains will be significantly enhanced via zk rollups, zk proofs, and new compression methods, further expanding the possible feature set of this new plug and play acceleration and interoperability layer.  
  
Still, the foundations are remarkably strong, and they are HERE TODAY. 

Thus, the digital currency called EGLD is not only the currency powering the MultiversX network -- the most scalable, advanced, and secure blockchain network today --, but also the digital currency underpinning a multiverse of new, composable, and expanding ecosystems, made possible and set in motion by Sovereign Chains. 

Once the world wakes up to these simple but inescapable facts, it will have to reconsider and reprice some of its beliefs and assumptions.  
  
For some chains, the prospects will look very bleak.  
  
Even Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, will face considerable scrutiny, once people grasp the implications. 

But the endgame need not be a zero sum pvp competitive deathmatch.  
  
Yet it might be, unless we forge a new path.  
  
The good news is that MultiversX has already changed the game through the technology it has shipped in production.  
  
Now, Sovereign Chains can offer new hope to some of these other ecosystems. 

I believe that to onboard the next billion people, every effort will matter.  
  
Thus, we are sounding the alarm on this impending scaling shockwave, and present the world and ecosystem with a solution.  
  
Users, builders, contributors, and investors must choose their next moves wisely. 

Fin.  
  
Your move now.

This is insane how easy it is to run a validator node on Algorand,algorand,1dt4lit,2024-07-01 17:27:39,127,0.98,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/1dt4lit/this_is_insane_how_easy_it_is_to_run_a_validator/,algerstmehn,General,"Just yesterday, a validator **with only 0.1 ALGO** (\~$0.014) was able to propose a block! [https://x.com/algoping/status/1807572771901521960](https://x.com/algoping/status/1807572771901521960)

Where else can you see this?

Over time, Algorand will become **THE** reference in terms of decentralization. It's just a matter of time!

**The Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) is a pure marvel.**

Many blockchains today use PoS, often for energy consumption reasons, but PoS - in its raw form - is probably one of the worst things that has happened to decentralization.

PoS/dPoS often leads to centralization issues, with power concentrated in the hands of a few players, where the majority of users have absolutely no chance of influencing the consensus, and where true decentralization is sidelined in favor of delegation, thereby disempowering users at the individual level within the network!

By creating Algorand, Silvio Micali wanted to create a network where anyone, even with limited resources, could **individually participate** in consensus and contribute to its security.

Silvio wasn't interested in semi-decentralization.  
Silvio wanted **pure decentralization**.

That's exactly why he developed Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS), ALGO's consensus mechanism, which is the only way to achieve true decentralization!

You have a standard machine? **You can join!**  
You only have a limited stake? **You can join!**

Thanks to the VRF technology (Verifiable Random Function), also invented by Silvio Micali, each new block proposer and all validator committees on Algorand are selected **completely randomly**, without communication with users and in a deterministic way!

When participating in consensus, each ALGO you own is like a kind of lottery ticket... **Everyone has the same chances!**

Sometimes, you can even see validators proposing blocks with less than 1 ALGO (0.1A is the minimum stake), just like yesterday!

Btw, that's why the name ""Algorand"" (Algorithmic Randomness).

In addition, it makes attacking the network by malicious actors difficult because, unlike PoS, it's impossible to know who to target in advance!

Yes, PPoS is a marvel of decentralization.

**+ P2P gossip network is coming!**

In a few months, Algorand will shift from a hub-and-spoke model (with relay nodes) to **a direct communication model between participation nodes** (P2P gossip network).

While relay nodes (which can be considered permissioned in a way) do not participate in the consensus and only optimize data propagation, they will soon **become completely optional**, without affecting network performance!

This is a major turning point for Algorand, as many people, like Justin Bons (on X), used to focus on and criticize the lack of decentralization caused by its relay nodes.

**PPoS + P2P gossip network will make Algorand the most decentralized blockchain EVER!**

NGL, not everything is perfect on ALGO today in terms of decentralization, and this is quite understandable for such a young chain.

There is still a lot of work to be done, particularly regarding better distribution of the stake participating in the consensus, and securing the network.

But Algorand is definitely on the right track!

Also, keep an eye on the Algorand Foundation's consensus incentivization program, coming in a few months!

Participating in Algorand consensus and getting paid for it will soon be possible!

Especially since it's super easy, and there's no need for expensive hardware to run a participation node! (see graph below)
