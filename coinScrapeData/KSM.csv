The code never lies, and it tells a story of who’s actually building versus just hyping. According to Santiment’s latest data, **Internet Computer (#ICP)** is crushing it at #1, with **Chainlink (#LINK)** and **Hedera (#HBAR)** hot on its heels.

What stands out? Projects like **Starknet (#STRK)** and **Optimism (#OP)**—they’re grinding hard on scaling solutions, while old-school favorites like **Polkadot (#DOT)** and **Cardano (#ADA)** still hold their ground. But **sUSD (#SUSD)** sneaking into the Top 10? That’s a plot twist. Are we underestimating stablecoins as innovation drivers? Maybe it’s time to rethink the narrative.

Section IV.M.2.a.cvi: Kusama (KSM)  
  
Kusama (KSM): Pioneering Innovation in Blockchain Scalability and Governance  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into Kusama (KSM), known as the ""canary network"" for Polkadot, exploring its role as a platform for rapid experimentation and development in blockchain technology. Kusama positions itself as a scalable multichain network that supports interoperability through its unique architecture, consisting of a relay chain and parachains. The paper examines the technical underpinnings of Kusama, focusing on its Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, high transaction throughput capabilities, and its governance model which empowers token holders to directly influence the network's evolution. Through an in-depth look at its economic model, we assess the utility and market performance of KSM, the native token. The analysis also covers the adoption of Kusama by developers for real-world applications, highlighting case studies of projects that have utilized its environment for testing and deployment. Moreover, we discuss the challenges Kusama faces, including technical risks and market volatility, and provide an outlook on its potential role in shaping the future of decentralized systems. This study aims to offer a nuanced understanding of Kusama's contributions to blockchain technology and its implications for stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem.

Well, I asked chatgpt why Hedera is performing this well without being on their leaderboard. This was the result. Guys were just getting started. Yesterday was mainly institutional money pouring in. Just wait until she flips into the top 10 and breaks into the trending leaderboard. We're number 50 right now!! Very little social engagement. Let's share this post and wake the people up!

The Flippening 2024


""Hedera (HBAR) has recently experienced a significant price increase, yet it may not appear among the top 50 trending cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. This discrepancy can be attributed to CoinMarketCap's trending algorithm, which considers factors such as user engagement, search frequency, and page views over specific time frames. Therefore, even with substantial price movements, a cryptocurrency might not rank highly in trending lists if it hasn't garnered sufficient user interest or activity on the platform during the evaluated period.

Additionally, CoinMarketCap's trending section often highlights newer or lesser-known cryptocurrencies that attract sudden interest, while more established assets like HBAR may not experience the same spikes in user engagement. Consequently, despite HBAR's notable price performance, it might not feature prominently in the trending rankings due to these algorithmic considerations.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's advisable to consult multiple sources and consider various metrics beyond trending lists, such as market capitalization, trading volume, and recent news developments.""

August saw a further reduction in Treasury spending, but there was still a net decrease of 875’945 DOT. [https://dune.com/substrate/polkadot-gov](https://dune.com/substrate/polkadot-gov)

One of the reasons for this is that the actual staking rate is very close to the ideal staking rate, meaning less inflow into the Treasury.

Has Their Been anything similar to pi network in the past that launched and went into mainnet. Did they have an IOU price and how did the IOU price correlate with the actual value of these cryptos?,PiNetwork,1e0f8gr,2024-07-10 23:29:38,22,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PiNetwork/comments/1e0f8gr/has_their_been_anything_similar_to_pi_network_in/,Particular_Milk3778,Discussion,"
Has their ever been a project like pi network that had to enter the mainnet. If so, give me examples of them and how much their price was at launch. Also in general when a crypto or stock is purchased with an IOU before it launches, how often does that price correlate with the actual value at launch..

ANSWER:

Projects similar to Pi Network that have entered mainnet include several cryptocurrencies that initially distributed tokens through non-traditional means like airdrops or initial coin offerings (ICOs) and later launched on their own blockchains. Some examples include:

EOS:

Launch: June 2018

Price at Launch: Approximately $5.40

TRON (TRX):

Launch: May 2018

Price at Launch: Approximately $0.05

Cardano (ADA):

Launch: September 2017

Price at Launch: Approximately $0.02

Stellar (XLM):

Launch: 2014 (Mainnet launched later)

Price at Launch: Approximately $0.003

IOUs and Actual Launch Prices

The correlation between IOU prices and actual launch prices can vary significantly:

Positive Correlation: In some cases, IOUs can be a good indicator of the initial market price, especially if the project has strong market interest and hype.

Negative Correlation: IOU prices can sometimes be overinflated due to speculative trading, leading to a correction once the token is officially launched and more widely traded.

Market Conditions: The overall market conditions at the time of the launch also play a significant role. If the market is bullish, the launch price can be higher than IOUs, and vice versa during bearish conditions.

In general, the correlation is inconsistent and heavily influenced by market sentiment, project fundamentals, and overall crypto market conditions at the time of the launch

HERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES WITH IOU PRICES COMPARED TO THEIR ACTUAL LAUNCH PRICE -


1. Polkadot (DOT)

IOU Price: DOT had IOUs traded on exchanges like MXC before the mainnet launch. Prices varied, but they generally hovered around $150-$200 (note: DOT underwent a redenomination later where 1 old DOT became 100 new DOT).

Launch Price: When Polkadot went live on the mainnet in August 2020, the new DOT token opened at around $2.90 (post-redenomination).

2. Filecoin (FIL)

IOU Price: FIL IOUs traded on exchanges like CoinList at prices ranging from $30 to $80 in anticipation of the mainnet launch.

Launch Price: When Filecoin launched its mainnet in October 2020, the price opened at around $30 and spiked as high as $200 due to high demand and limited initial liquidity, but quickly stabilized to around $40-$50.

3. Ecomi (OMI)

IOU Price: OMI IOUs traded on Bitforex at around $0.0001 to $0.0002 before the mainnet launch.

Launch Price: When Ecomi's OMI token officially launched on Uniswap in March 2021, the price initially spiked to around $0.001 to $0.002.

4. Kusama (KSM)

IOU Price: Kusama's IOUs traded at prices ranging from $1 to $5 on exchanges like MXC before the mainnet launch.

Launch Price: Upon mainnet launch in August 2019, KSM opened at around $1.70, gradually increasing as the project gained traction.

5. Solana (SOL)

IOU Price: SOL had IOUs trading at around $0.20 to $0.50 before its mainnet beta launch.

Launch Price: When Solana launched its mainnet beta in March 2020, the price opened at around $0.50 to $0.80.

Correlation Insights

Polkadot (DOT): The IOU price and the post-redenomination launch price showed a strong correlation.

Filecoin (FIL): The initial launch price significantly exceeded the IOU price due to high demand but later stabilized closer to IOU prices.

Ecomi (OMI): The launch price showed a substantial increase from IOU prices, likely due to initial excitement and limited supply.

Kusama (KSM): IOU prices were relatively aligned with the launch price, though the price increased gradually as the project matured.

Solana (SOL): The launch price was slightly higher than the IOU prices, showing moderate correlation.

Overall, while there can be some correlation between IOU prices and actual launch prices, the degree of correlation varies and is influenced by market conditions, project hype, and initial liquidity.

*****How does pi networks goals, foundation, current success and eco friendly approach compare to those examples you gave me. ??****

Answer-

Pi Network has unique characteristics compared to the examples provided (Polkadot, Filecoin, Ecomi, Kusama, Solana). Here’s a comparative analysis based on goals, foundation, current success, and eco-friendly approach:

Goals

Pi Network: Aims to create a user-friendly, decentralized cryptocurrency that can be mined via mobile phones with minimal resource consumption. It focuses on accessibility and inclusivity, aiming to bring cryptocurrency to the masses.

Polkadot (DOT): Seeks to enable different blockchains to interoperate seamlessly. Its goal is to create a decentralized web where users are in control.

Filecoin (FIL): Aims to create a decentralized storage network, allowing users to rent out their unused storage space. It focuses on data storage and retrieval.

Ecomi (OMI): Focuses on digital collectibles and NFTs, aiming to bring mainstream adoption of blockchain technology in the digital collectibles space.

Kusama (KSM): Serves as a canary network for Polkadot, allowing developers to experiment with new features in a real-world environment. It aims to foster innovation and rapid development.

Solana (SOL): Focuses on high-performance blockchain technology, aiming to provide fast, secure, and scalable decentralized applications and crypto-currencies.

Foundation

Pi Network: Developed by a team of Stanford graduates, it has built its foundation on the concept of mobile mining and creating a widespread network of users before launching on the mainnet.

Polkadot: Created by Dr. Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum. It has a strong foundation with significant technical expertise and a well-defined vision for blockchain interoperability.

Filecoin: Developed by Protocol Labs, also the creators of IPFS. It has a robust technical foundation focused on decentralized storage solutions.

Ecomi: Built by a team with experience in the digital collectibles industry. It leverages partnerships with well-known brands to enhance its appeal.

Kusama: Developed by the same team behind Polkadot, it shares much of the same technology and vision but focuses on experimental and early-stage projects.

Solana: Founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, it has a strong technical foundation with innovations like the Proof of History consensus mechanism.

Current Success

Pi Network: Boasts millions of users participating in its mining process via mobile apps, but it hasn't launched its mainnet yet. Its success lies in its large and engaged user base, but it still faces skepticism regarding its long-term viability and actual use case.

Polkadot: Successfully launched its mainnet and has become one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. It has numerous projects built on its ecosystem.

Filecoin: Launched its mainnet and is actively used for decentralized storage solutions. It has secured significant partnerships and a strong market presence.

Ecomi: Launched its mainnet and has a growing user base, particularly in the digital collectibles market. It has gained traction through partnerships with major brands.

Kusama: Successfully operating as an experimental network for Polkadot, with many projects and parachains testing on it before moving to Polkadot.

Solana: Has seen significant success with numerous projects building on its platform, a high transaction throughput, and a strong market presence.

Eco-Friendly Approach

Pi Network: Emphasizes low-energy mobile mining, which is significantly less resource-intensive than traditional mining methods like those used in Bitcoin.

Polkadot: Uses a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than Proof of Work (PoW).

Filecoin: Uses a Proof of Replication and Proof of Spacetime consensus mechanism, which, while energy-intensive due to storage requirements, aims to optimize storage resources.

Ecomi: Built on the GoChain blockchain, which uses Proof of Reputation (PoR) and is designed to be more energy-efficient.

Kusama: Similar to Polkadot, it uses a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) mechanism, which is more eco-friendly compared to PoW.

Solana: Uses a Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) hybrid consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than PoW.

Summary

Pi Network: Focuses on accessibility, mobile mining, and eco-friendliness, with its main success being its large user base and novel approach to mining. However, it still needs to prove its viability and use case upon mainnet launch.

Others: Polkadot, Filecoin, Ecomi, Kusama, and Solana have all launched their mainnets and have established themselves in their respective niches with varying degrees of success. They employ various eco-friendly consensus mechanisms and have solid technical foundations and active ecosystems.

I would have liked to have sold my tokens before the drop price, but everything seems well designed to make it only possible to sell at the worst historical low. 



When will they update the software and release the token lock? 

When will I be able to get out of these tokens? 

I will prefer not to use Ledger after this soap opera.



Zero trust in Kusama/Polkadot after Marketcap update! 

I can't swallow the fact that no one saw that the main indicator of growth, distribution and inflation of a token was not updated and no one saw it, even though it contains one of the largest DEV communities in the crypto world. Nobody saw? And everything is fine? Uffff.... I'm out!

I left with no loss but I will never return to this network!

All on the SAME DAY. Marketcap update, DOUBLEING IT, API update making it impossible for holders to sell and Ledger frozen until TODAY!!!

2. **Zarejestruj się i zweryfikuj konto**: Po wyborze giełdy, zarejestruj się na jej platformie. W procesie rejestracji możesz być zobowiązany do przesłania dokumentów tożsamości w celu weryfikacji konta.

3. **Dokonaj depozytu**: Po zakończeniu procesu rejestracji zaloguj się na swoje konto na giełdzie. Następnie dokonaj depozytu środków w złotówkach (PLN) na swoje konto giełdowe.

Aby szybko i bezpiecznie kupić kryptowalutę Kusama (KSM), należy postępować z rozwagą i korzystać z zaufanych platform. Oto kilka kroków, które warto podjąć:

1. **Wybierz zaufaną giełdę kryptowalutową**: Wybór odpowiedniej giełdy kryptowalutowej jest kluczowy dla bezpieczeństwa twoich środków. Upewnij się, że wybrana platforma ma dobrą reputację, silne zabezpieczenia oraz odpowiednie regulacje. Przeprowadź dokładne badania i zapoznaj się z opiniami innych użytkowników przed dokonaniem wyboru.

2. **Zarejestruj się na giełdzie kryptowalutowej**: Po wyborze odpowiedniej giełdy, zarejestruj się na jej platformie. Proces rejestracji zazwyczaj wymaga podania podstawowych informacji osobistych oraz weryfikacji tożsamości zgodnie z wymaganiami regulacyjnymi.

4. **Kup Kusama (KSM)**: Po zasileniu swojego konta na giełdzie, przejdź do sekcji handlowej i znajdź parę walutową KSM/USD lub KSM/BTC. Następnie wybierz ilość Kusama, którą chcesz zakupić, oraz zatwierdź transakcję.

5. **Przechowuj swoje Kusama bezpiecznie**: Po dokonaniu zakupu, nie zapomnij przenieść swoich Kusama na portfel kryptowalutowy, który oferuje wysoki poziom bezpieczeństwa. Portfele sprzętowe, takie jak Ledger Nano S czy Trezor, są uważane za jedne z najbezpieczniejszych opcji przechowywania kryptowalut.

Pamiętaj, że inwestowanie w kryptowaluty wiąże się z ryzykiem, dlatego zawsze powinieneś wykonywać własne badania i podejmować decyzje inwestycyjne z rozwagą.

A few weeks ago I withdrew some PHA from my GateIO account to Kucoin. Mistakenly I selected the PHALA network instead of the KHALA network, which is the only PHA network that Kucoin supports currently.

The address I was provided to deposit for the KHALA network is the following:

464ZW3fZoBwut7L8Cs9VD3wWFiA5uujNmUhaEYBoSoaoNesr

Transaction: 0x3f572714add877bc32427744ca6eb58f11bcf52faeb5faddda5cc1fa402b6ae9

As you can see my PHA is sitting there in this wallet.

I spoke with the PHALA Network team and they ensured me that if the wallet address is the same as the KHALA one provided by Kucoin, then Kucoin are the custodians of both wallets and in theory could access my funds as the seed phrase is the same for both wallets. 

Unfortunately everytime I try to discuss this with someone at Kucoin, they tell me that PHALA network is unsupported and they cannot do anything. But this goes against the advice I have received from PHALA themselves:

>yes sure, the seed phrase of a substrate wallet gives you access to all the parachain wallets... the address of the khala wallet is identical to the phala wallet, so Kucoin has access to those funds but it is at the discretion of the exchange to return them to you.  
>  
>this account: 464ZW3fZoBwut7L8Cs9VD3wWFiA5uujNmUhaEYBoSoaoNesr is your khala deposit account on Kucoin, since Kucoin is a CEX, it is obvious that the exchange has the private keys of that wallet on Khala and they match the same for phala.

I would like someone who has more knowledge on this matter to look into it as I believe there is a way to recover my funds if Kucoin wanted to.

Ticket request: 3735852

Thanks in advance

Chainlink Flips Cardano To Become #1 Crypto In Project Development Activity! 🚀,ethtrader,1bl6pim,2024-03-22 14:44:23,5,0.57,67,https://i.redd.it/h3h9ftb4lxpc1.jpeg,kirtash93,News,"> Data shows that Chainlink (LINK) has surpassed Cardano (ADA) in becoming the king of cryptocurrency projects in this metric.
>
>To measure this work, Santiment’s indicator uses the concept of “events.” An event refers to the developer’s action on the cryptocurrency’s repository.
>
>These events aren’t the same as “commits,” which are records of changes made to the repo’s code. The analytics firm has chosen this methodology rather than simply measuring the number of GitHub commits themselves because the latter can sometimes prove to be inaccurate.

![Cryptocurrency](https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-GQQxbTj6QMllBvTpQpoGemd9/user-unEcu9WVypYYUy5qJjNJllVc/img-LOOgG4LAOdhBneNQZ0ccjV4j.png)

Tired of watching your aunt brag about her Bitcoin earnings or listening to your brother-in-law talk about BNB's latest surge? Yeah, we've all been there. So, this time around, let's look at some lesser-known cryptos that could supercharge your portfolio in March 2024.

1. PolkaDot (DOT)
Ever heard of Polkadot? Come on, don’t blush! DOT is involved in enabling different blockchains to communicate and share information. With a robust, growing ecosystem and technological innovation at its core, it's a perfect fit for risk-loving daredevils.

2. Chainlink (LINK)
Chainlink, you say? Well, it's advancing smart contracts by connecting them with real-world data, APIs, and payments. Linking cryptoverse to the physical world? Hell yeah!

3. Uniswap (UNI)
Don't snooze on this powerhorse. Uniswap has established itself as the go-to decentralized exchange on Ethereum due to its unique protocol enabling users to trade directly from their wallets.

4. Cardano (ADA)
Cardano is like that lanky nerd who quite unexpectedly becomes the high school quarterback. Its innovative Proof of Stake algorithm breathes fresh air into blockchain security and eco-friendliness.

5. Avalanche (AVAX)
Avalanche provides an interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. With less public attention than Ethereum and more room for growth, AVAX might just be your ticket to moon.

6. Rebellion Protocol (REBL)
Let's shake things up. Rebellion Protocol is crypto-focused venture capital run by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization on the blockchain. It's one of the first Investment DAOs and let me tell you, they're going to explode in 2024. Why wear a suit when you can run Wall Street in pyjamas, right? Check it out at [Rebellion Protocol Homepage](https://rebellionprotocol.com/). Don't say I didn't warn you!

7. Kusama (KSM)
Kusama: Polkadot’s wilder cousin! With faster governance and lower entry barriers, KSM is where the action is. Facing less scrutiny, it’s ripe for growth, and wild indeed!

8. Orion Protocol (ORN)
Say hello to Orion Protocol, the B2B gateway to the entire crypto market. Its robust and decentralized platform could propel ORN to sky-rocketing heights.

9. VeChain (VET)
Last but not least, VeChain brings blockchain tech to the business world, providing supply chain solutions for simpler tracking. It's like pizza delivery tracking but on steroids!

There you have it, folks. Ten potentially lucrative crypto assets that have flown under the radar, waiting for smart investors like you to swoop in and reap the benefits.

Note of Caution:
Remember, no investment is risk-free, especially not in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Make sure to do your due diligence before you dive into this wild ride. Research, stay informed, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
