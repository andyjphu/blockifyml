In UK, several technologies such as Wi-Fi-based positioning, ultra-wideband indoor positioning, and Bluetooth beacon positioning, in particular, have been gaining prominence. These technologies are incorporated for positioning solutions. For instance, in 2017, 2,000 battery-powered beacons were placed in Gatwick Airport, London, to generate indoor navigation and provide location data to customers traveling through. The beacon positioning allows customers to turn on an AR (augmented reality) application to follow the arrows shown on the camera’s view, as well as translate signs into different dialects. The system at London airport reportedly supported the positioning with the accuracy of +/- 3m.

The banks in the country keep adapting their systems for incorporating new digital and payment technologies. One of the instances of such a payment framework is the person-to-person (P2P) instant mobile payment system, BIZUM, developed in October 2016. BIZUM is a consumer-friendly technology based on a proxy database that obtains International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) of the clients directly from their mobile numbers. In addition, the Spanish banks have introduced the SCTInst processes in November 2017, which made instant payments a common payment method available to all Spanish customers and represents 10% of regular SEPA Credit Transfer transactions.

The advancement in automotive technology such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles has created new prospects for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and automotive TIC companies to upgrade, revise, and modify testing technology to comply with future road safety regulation requirements. The integration of such advanced technology will require rigorous investments, R&D, and innovation in TIC processes. However, the advancement also brings new opportunities for automotive TIC companies to expand their service portfolio as per futuristic trends and grow their businesses. For instance, in May 2024, Skoda Auto inaugurated new facilities for the Emissions Center and a brand-new Simulation Center in Mladá Boleslav. Following investments of nearly $23.6 million, the laboratory will bolster the car manufacturer's in-house development capabilities within the Technical Development department. State-of-the-art technologies allow for the precise and accurate simulation of several climatic conditions, enabling comprehensive tests that mimic real-world operations.

Navigating the New Horizons of Orion Protocol (ORN) in 2025

Abstract

This analysis delves into the recent developments surrounding Orion Protocol (ORN), particularly focusing on its performance, technological advancements, and market dynamics as of early 2025. After its listing on Coinbase, ORN has shown significant fluctuations in price, witnessing a -6.70% decline within the last week, juxtaposed against a broader market upturn. We explore the impact of Orion's recent technical upgrades, including the Erigon infrastructure integration for a 4x performance increase and the Fork ID 12 upgrade, on its operational efficiency and ecosystem growth. The introduction of a modular Layer 2 solution aims at enhancing liquidity and integrating Real World Assets (RWA), possibly setting a new trend in DeFi. Moreover, this piece examines community sentiment, price predictions, and the regulatory landscape's influence on ORN's trajectory. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to provide insights into ORN's current position and its potential path forward in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

Beyond Survival: Chapter-3,HFY,1i386n6,2025-01-16 23:17:25,17,0.9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i386n6/beyond_survival_chapter3/,ruijard,OC,"“Alright, people! Remember the protocols! Exo-rigs and Environmental suits will stay on no matter what you see out there. Even if the sensors say that the environment is clean, we don’t know what types of unknown lifeforms or microorganisms live there.”

The group of scientists simply nodded at Dr. Anderson’s words as their civilian-grave exo-rigs whined with the power of hydraulics and motors, allowing them to carry the cumbersome scientific equipment through the portal easily.

To save their meager reserves of fuel and energy, Dr. Anderson and General Carter decided to reduce the size of the portal, allowing them to save as much energy as possible so that they could commence large-scale evacuation in a week at most instead of the projected one month they would have needed if they left the portal size as it was.

However, this did have the problem that they would have to take most of their vital technology and equipment in pieces and reassemble them on the other side along with making bulk transportation nearly impossible.

In the end, they had no choice but to go through with this plan due to resource constraints.

The group of scientists slowly moved through the gate, allowing them to see the verdant forest on the other side, which stunned them with its beauty.

It is one thing to watch it through the screen and another entirely to see it in person.

“Remember, *don’t* take off your environmental suits under any circumstances.”

Once again, Dr. Anderson reminded his group which nodded at his words, albeit more reluctantly than before they crossed over.

The built-in sensors of their exo-rigs, the exoskeleton that almost all the scientific and military groups in their complex wore, showed just how clean the atmosphere of this world was, heavily tempting this group of humans who were forced to breathe in recycled air for almost two decades to just take off their suits and enjoy the fresh air for once.

However, their logic and reasoning told them that it was a very bad idea to do so without proper study of the native atmosphere.

Given the alien nature of this world, despite its initial looks making it look extremely similar to ancient Earth, there was no telling the kind of microorganism that could be airborne. Hell, there is even the chance that humans themselves could become the source of a new kind of ecological disaster for this world with the countless microorganisms that they carry on their bodies.

The group slowly walked towards the Marines who had already established a temporary shelter in this location with fabricators that produced modular and interlocking blocks made of concrete over the past week where they had been moving back and forth between the worlds to establish a foothold.

Today, the task of the scientists is to run an entire battery of tests on the local environment, assess their compatibility with human life, and, if proven to be a good place, give the go-ahead for the construction crews that were waiting back at the base to begin the fabrication of an initial base and fortification on this side of the base.

Slowly, the scientists put down the massive machinery on the ground and started wiring them together with wireless relay stations that they brought with them to establish a data stream with the base on the other side.

While creating hardlines through the gate was proven to be impossible, signals can still be transmitted wirelessly through it, allowing humans to continue communicating with their implants.

“Seismic detectors ready”

“Radar and Lidar systems ready”

“Underground scanners ready”

“Atmospheric detection systems ready”

“Filtration and detection systems ready”

“Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, and Humidity detectors ready”

“DNA sampling and sequencing systems ready”

“Accelerated growth pods ready”

“Genetic analysis and prediction systems ready”

“Clean room ready”

“Quarantine room ready”

“Medical Fabricators ready”

“All systems are ready, Dr. Anderson.”

“Good. Let’s get to it.”

Dr. Anderson and his team directly walked into the self-sealing tents set up for their clean room and quarantine rooms. Determination was evident behind all of their helmets.

This group of people now had the responsibility to secure a future for their entire race, and they would be damned before they slacked off even a little bit and allowed a variable to slip through their notice.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Earth, somewhere over Brazil.***

A fleet of passenger jets tore through the sky at blistering speeds, carrying precious cargo aboard.

Their air-breathing Hydrogen-powered Scramjets screeched into the ruined atmosphere as their frames continued to deteriorate under the onslaught of the Corruption.

As the outer layer of the craft deteriorated rapidly and reached a point where it was no longer viable, they were ejected, revealing another layer of armor beneath the one that was just ejected.

Every craft was designed with six such layers, each layer projected to withstand the Corruption for up to five hours at least.

However, the recent acceleration in The Corruption affects on everything around the world, that time had been cut down drastically. This, combined with the need to replace the Scramjets of the aircraft every few hours or so with on-board fabricators and the accelerated deterioration of the crafts as a whole with every minute spent moving below the sound barrier meant that these jets were operating at the edge of death every second of their flight.

And yet, its passengers had no choice but to take these dangerous crafts to their destination, heading straight for the Nevada bunker.

Aboard one of the crafts in the fleet, a military woman wearing military-grade Exo-rig and environmental suit walked into the cabin of the pilots.

“Captain, how far are we from Neva Base?”

“Ten hours, Colonel, including our pit stop in Brazil for ejecting our damaged engines and replacing them.”

Colonel Alice Bennett nodded her head and settled down on one of the seats behind the pilots.

One of the two pilots hesitated for a minute before speaking up.

“Permission to speak freely, Ma’am?”

“Granted, Captain Hughes.”

“What are the chances that all of us will make it to Nevada?”

Colonel Alice fell silent at those words as her mind swirled with emotions. However, her training kicked in, making her look towards the Captain with a stoic look hidden behind her helmet.

“I do not know, Captain. I will not lie to you and insult your intelligence since you know just as well as I do that not everyone will make it to the base intact.”

The Captain simply nodded at the words and turned back to the instruments, his expressions, and emotions hidden behind his own environmental suit.

After Project: Infinity, the research being conducted in Antarctica to prepare an Orion-Drive-based space shuttle for the exodus of the human race was deemed a failure a week ago due to the uncertainty of its operation in the Stellar Storm just like every other type of spacecraft tried before along with the long duration required to prepare a working prototype, the General of the Army, General Carter, the General of the Marines, Issac White, and the General of the Airforce, Aarav Patel, the last surviving military leaders from around the world after the two decades-long fight against The Corruption and its infected, initiated an evacuation of the other two bunkers of the Earth.

At this point, everyone had realized that either Project: Exodus must have succeeded, or the leaders of what remains of humanity had decided that it was better for all of them to die together, giving them at least a little bit of solace as they slipped into the embrace of death.

The people of the other bunkers also knew that not all of them would survive the journey.

The Antarctic base housed nearly three thousand people, all of which were scientific and military units along with their close families. A significantly small number compared to the nearly sixteen thousand people of the Nevada Bunker and the nearly ten thousand people of the Himalayan Bunker.

While the travel system employed by the Himalayan Bunker was much safer than that of the Antarctic base since they utilized underground Hyperloop systems, they would still face significant danger just as their counterparts traveling through the air due to the constant earthquakes plaguing that part of the world along with unexpected Corruption brought into the Hyperloop systems through underground water systems, both artificial and natural.

In the end, the higher-ups estimated that only 85% of the people from Antarctica and 90% of people from the Himalayan bunker would make it to Nevada Base.

And yet, despite this grim projection that had been shared with everyone, they still undertook this journey, for they knew that it was better to try and make it to their salvation than suffer a slow and painful death, or a fate worse than death, at the hands of The Corruption.

Just like Colonel Alice’s commanding officer, Major General Samuel Lewis, and the majority of her unit had suffered during their hasty retreat from Antarctica after The Corruption somehow made its way into the bunker.

With those depressing thoughts in mind, just like with the rest of the people aboard this fleet of aircraft, she silently watched the Captain and his co-pilot work on getting them to their salvation, or their doom.

Ahoy, Pirates!

  
As we push ahead to Cycle 12 we'd like to share with you all some standout items from the last week. We're also setting the expectation - we plan to issue these Cycle Reports following the conclusion of each cycle so that those of you not yet with us on Discord may stay appraised of our activities as we pirate and pillage our way to the top of the leaderboards.

  
As discussed in Franz's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKumoCrew/comments/1hyl9h1/pp20_cycle_11/), this cycle was a big one for us. Our change in leadership was a surprise to all, and the galaxy watched with uncertainty as they looked to see how Cycle 11 would play out for us.  
This was made even tougher as word spread of the old leadership's ousting, and rival Powers dialed up the pressure hoping to capitalize on what they thought would be a moment of weakness.

It wasn't.

As our PVP pilots slaughtered **487 CMDRs** across the galaxy, our Marauders and Raiders went after a number of strategically important systems that our Strategists had prioritized for us.  
One of those priority targets was **LTT 198,** the permit-locked home system of [Torval Mining Ltd](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Torval_Mining_Ltd) \- Zemina Torval's corporation which propelled her family to unfathomable fortune. Yet all it took was the Pirate King glancing their way to send her people running.  
**That's right: Torval Orbital now belongs to Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew.**

Among our other accomplishments this cycle, we took a number of other important systems while simultaneously repelling heavy undermining efforts and staunch opposition in places like **Turd Wu**, **Bodb Den**, and more.

  
As Franz's post earlier this Cycle stated, **Kumo Crew is stronger than ever before** and the way this Cycle has played out serves as proof. Kumo Crew is stagnant no longer. 

  
You'll see us in a system near you soon.

\-            5 CE

“Praise be to Jarnsaxa, for in her eyes, we are holy. Praise be to the mother, Bellona, for her divine fury delivers conquest. Praise be to the father Astreus, for his divine kingship delivers us the right to rule. Through them, we expand in our holy order for the glory of expansion, the glory of Jarnsaxa. Go forth, warriors, and deliver her divine expansion to the untamed lands.”

The Father completed his blessing on the assembled soldiers of the Holy Order of Expansion. The newest Holy Legion had been assembled at the behest of the church of Jarnsaxa and the Explorers of Nomina. Such an undertaking between the two had not occurred in many years, and after 8 months of debates and planning, the two groups were eager to begin the conquest before the new Emperor rescinded his predecessor’s blessings to conquer.

Legate Devi watched the different levels of piety among his troops. The Gods of Aristo still held sway within the Empire, but it was not the faithful that served in the Holy Legion it was the desperate. Jarnsaxa was a lesser goddess, but the role her church played in expanding the borders meant that whenever a crusade was called, her followers seemed to flow from the shadows like Erebus himself. Devi knew there were few, if any, among his legion who worshipped the Lady as he did. Most of them were followers of Bellona looking for a fight or the undevoted hoping that they could tame a patch of the untamed lands for themselves.

“Lady Jarnsaxa, please petition Clio on my behalf, or your holy warriors may never see beyond our borders.” He offered in a silent prayer.

The sponsorship of this Crusade meant that three Legions had been formed. The first was the Holy Legion, which consisted of the true soldiers of the faith and from which Devi was pulled this was led by First Legate Orion Stormbreaker, the military leader of the order. Legate Ayen Keycyne Qinsandoral Nyana Zentha Irhaal of the Whistling Wind led the second. Like Devi, the elf’s legion was made up of volunteers. Ayen and Devi had served together under the Stormbreaker. Devi had thought that they could be more than compatriots, but something changed, and Ayen grew distant and cold. Whatever caused that crack to form between them, it was now a canyon for this Crusade would be the Stormbreaker’s last. The two lock their gaze for a moment, one of them would be the next First Legate and the other their subordinate.

“Prefect Horan,” Devi’s second in command snapped to attention. “Break camp, begin the march we have to reach the Temple of Eotous with all haste.”

“Yes, Sir. Second Legion, move out!”

As is custom, the legions would march together to the edge of the Empire before they would spread out completing the conquest. For this Crusade, the legions would march together to the temple of Eotous, which marked the easternmost point of the empire.

\-        6 CE 11^(th) month

A year had passed since the Eastern Crusade commenced. Devi and the Second Legion had been assigned to follow the River of Eotous. The region was fairly well documented, and little resistance was expected. There were known people living along the rive,r but all the towns they came across were abandoned. Reaching the unnamed lake system the Second Legion encountered a hostile presence who opposed them at every turn. The inhabitants of the area had formed The Kingdom of Riia under a mysterious figure. Gathering a population from the riverfolk and the surrounding lands beyond they represented a considerable population group for the single legion. They were not a force that was sent out for conquest. Their mission was to pacify unaligned towns and the wilderness. What was supposed to be a short mission ended up a war. The Second Legion and Riia suffered heavy losses, but Devi maintained the upper hand.

Devi sat in his office after the conquest of Jeehwood, what was left of the Legion had to hold for the coming winter. Reports lay strewn across the desk, the only ones that mattered still had not arrived. No one had heard from the First or Third Legion since first contact was made with the Riia. The Stormbreaker had ordered Devi to begin diplomatic talks and, if that failed, to fall back immediately and await further orders from the Third Legion. Yet no word came from the First, and Ayen never arrived. Devi did his duty and waited until the Riia attacked in the night. More than those who should have been were lost that night, including Prefect Horan. For the first time, Devi broke protocol and sent a messenger to the Emperor before setting sights on the Riia. Two years of slow conquest with a dwindling fighting force in enemy territory had drained not only resources but the morale of many. The ragtag group of volunteers had developed into a hardened force of warriors that Devi knew could now go toe to toe with the First Legion if it came to it, but then that’s what happens when an expansion force meant to pacify the wild turned into a military force.

“Lord Valtair, why have you forsaken your blessings on me? Our allies fall silent, and my enemy refuses all attempts for peace. Great Lady Jarnsaxa deliver unto me servants of your Uncle so that my men may find comfort in his peace. We set out in your name to expand the Empire, but not like this. Are not all people children of the Gods. Why must we fight when they too can receive your blessings.” A knock at the door brings Devi from his prayer.

“My Lord Devi?” A small moleish human entered the room.

“I serve with no distinction of nobility, Mayor Gunter if you must refer to me as Legate.”

“Ah-yes-well, Lo-Legate Devi ,it seems a representative of the King has arrived.”

While there had never been word from the rulers of this Kingdom each town was openly friendly to the Second after discovering they were not bloodthirsty marauders. Perhaps now word had finally gotten back to the Kin,g and this war of revenge could end.

“Devi the fool.” A familiar voice greeted him upon his arrival to this side room. A voice that had once promised its love to him.

“Ayen? Wh- I-”

“You couldn’t follow simple orders, could you? It’s funny if you had shown your resourcefulness sooner then maybe our places would have been switched. You were always the better commander. This plan required someone with more cunning which is why the- pardon me, King Stormbreaker chose me to be his second in command.”

“The Stormbreaker is the king? What is going on!”

“Politics Devi. The Empire is faltering, they embrace change like it means something and reject the past. Our power made us strong. People mock our past, but they do not fear us anymore. Stormbreaker sees this, he knows that the only way truly forward is by conquest and rule of might like the emperors of old. Things moved a bit quicker than imagined, so we had to spring up this little kingdom sooner than we had expected.”

“This is insane. What was supposed to happen-what did you expect the Empire would allow you to rule here?

“You were not supposed to invade you were supposed to die. Then I would return saying both Legions were lost in a skirmish with Nordland, and while the Horde of Bellona was called to defend the nation, we would slip in taking power.”

“You would betray your oath to the Lady and the Emperor so the Stormbreaker could take the throne? Because his pride was hurt by the words of people across the seas?!” Anger dripped from his voice. Devi lost his men people who had come as volunteers but had stayed for the Empire. People better than Ayen and Stormbreaker who had laid their lives down. He hefted his axe from his belt “I beseech the judgment of Ran! Legate Ayen has committed an act of rebellion to break the balance of life and bring destruction to the land. If you judge her innocent, stop my axe!”

Ayen realized too late what was coming. The sword they drew too late did nothing to stop the axe head from delivering its wielder’s justice.

“Alert the Horde.”

\-        7 CE 2^(nd) month

“I am Lord Commander Dyrrick of the Guard. I have been blessed by Emperor Astur with rightful duty, anointed by Ran of judgment, granted the axe of Paxos and Bellona and I am here to deliver justice. Orion, you have been judged in the eyes of Aristo and the Empire. You betray the balance of life for your own greed. You will find no peace in this world or the next. Know before your death that your name will be remembered for your crimes, and your accomplishments will be stricken. I would pity you if your life was worth anything.”

With the finality of his proclamation the axe fell, and the Stormbreaker was no more. Perhaps fittingly, thunder rolled across the sky. The gathered crowd was made up of the members of the former Second Legion, the token force the Horde had left behind, as well as the citizens of the former Kingdom who now cheered for the end of the pretender.

“First Legate Devi, Emperor Astur has extended a personal invite when your Legion returns to the capital. You have far exceeded the expectations of any citizen. Between you and me, if you ever tire of the Legion, you have a place within the Guard.” The Lord Commander spoke to Devi over the celebrations.

“I am most honored, Commander, but my heart belongs to the Lady, and she needs me now more than ever to guide the true belief.”

Memory Transcription Subject: Avdral, VOUMR Director

Date (standardized human time): February 1, 2137

This station was never built to be self-sufficient.

That's how I'm going to have to start. Most of the UMR facilities were designed to operate indefinitely without outside supplies. They were the newer models, complete with advanced manufacturing systems, miniaturized power plants, and all sorts of ultra-modern technology I didn't even think the Kolshians had.

We were not. My facility, the first of its kind ever to be constructed, was not modern enough to be able to survive without regular, if rare, shipments of niche supplies from Talsk. Things our onboard factories and 3D printers couldn't make on their own.

Even in the event of an apocalyptic level disaster, which was *exactly what we were going through now*, the idea was that Talsk command would still be active and capable of delivering us covert supply drops where necessary.

Oh, they weren't supposed to be necessary often. Super-growth greenhouse vats, highly-durable materials, in-house medical facilities, and industrial-grade factories, we could rebuild Nishtal from the fucking ground up if we had to. Which was good. Because this facility was built to cover the very real, very likely, very possible eventuality that we would, in fact, have to. Like we were having to do now.

For those unaware, which was basically no one because even the bastards who were living under a rock for the past couple of months still felt the seismic shocks when the earthquake-grade bombs made impact,  the Arxur bombed this planet. To ash. As far as I could tell, which is to say, pretty damn far to say the least, there was nothing left of Nishtal outside of this little underwater mining & research shindig I had set up for myself about five nautical miles under the ocean surface.

The facility was deep enough to be safe from even the most powerful orbital scanner. Shielded enough to shrug off the undersea ripples and underground earthquakes from all the surface detonations when the Arxur began hitting cities. We had nothing to worry about from those bombs being dropped. But we still felt them hit.

Our agents in Alkar Varyal, a coastal city where the submarines picked up those few goods and parts that we couldn't fabricate ourselves at home, told me everything I needed to know after the Arxur left orbit. Nothing. Dead fucking silence. A quick foray to the surface just confirmed their story. Nothing, it appears, survived the Arxur attack. They hadn't even left the ruins still upright.

That, to my facility's credit, wasn't when the panic started to set in. We kept going on as our duties entailed, half of us because they were probably the last of the Krakotl species and they intended for its last moments to be ones they could take pride in, and half of us because we were simply Farsul and us Farsul were above such animal emotions as blind panic. Fear was meant to serve a purpose, and if it served none, it was meant to be extinguished. Simple as that.

So panic did not set in on the day the grays bombed Kiltra Tamis. And it did not set in during the weeks and months after that, either. We continued about our duties for a while. Experiments were run. Resources were mined and refined to support them. Expansions were done to our meager hydroponic facilities, mostly algae farms that grew food native to Nishtal's waters already, but with the ecological collapse that followed Nishtal's glassing, we found ourselves hard-pressed to find nutrients to sustain them. Still, we carried on. We were the best of our species. And, in nature, the best of the species survived.

By the time we had fixed most of our issues down here, using parts that, in many cases, were impossible to make or replace with this facility's machinery, the situation had grown untenable up there. Our suppliers on Talsk were now nullified. Their last transmissions spoke of a predator attack. After that, a human message that confirmed the worst. The archives had been found and exposed. Nobody else, except maybe the humans, knew of the UMR outposts.

Only once my subordinates and I realized that help was not, in fact, coming for us, did we truly begin to panic.

Nobody rioted. There was no point in breaking anything. Besides, us prey, even Krakotl, were far too dignified to express ourselves in that kind of a predatory fashion. No, we just screamed and cried and went absolutely catatonic like the good, dignified, mature herbivore species we were. The Krakotl and the Farsul. The galaxy's enlightened caretakers mixed with its most savage proper sapients. I think it's easy to predict which of the two species on-site reacted to the news with the most emotion.

My predecessors all had similar guesses. It was still a fifty-fifty shot, so even a Yotul would have had at least a ten percent chance of success, but the archivists that oversaw this operation's establishment all predicted that, in the event of a major catastrophe, the Krakotl would lose their shit and start killing things.

Which was why, when they made the decision to overrepresent Farsul in our on-site exterminator unit, they gave our security teams neural stun weapons precisely so the Krakotl *couldn't* lose their shit and start killing things.

Fortunately, this decision was entirely unnecessary, because none of my personnel actually decided to lose their shit and kill someone. There was no point. Even a Krakotl knew you couldn't use a flamethrower on a lack of supplies. Especially since the very term 'lack' implied there was nothing there that was capable of being flamethrowered.

But, with the lack of essential resources becoming an issue, we had to start improvising. That was why I was here in the first place. Not here in the facility, I had a different reason for that, but here in my meeting room. Surrounded by the overseers of all the different sectors. Mining, research, underwater, we had it all. That was probably why they called this place an Underwater Mining and Research facility, but I was never any good with names so that wasn't my issue to solve.

The spare parts shortage was, though, and I had called this meeting to tackle it hopefully before it ever became a problem. Unlike *some* powerful leaders I knew, I had no intentions of sweeping any issues under the furniture for the next administration to deal with. Especially since, you know, there probably would not be any next administration. That was just how the numbers were, though. Not much I could do about it.

""Okay, I asked you all to come up with reports a while back, and now I'd like to see them,"" I said with a tired sigh. I really did feel like clocking out around now.

""Okay, sir. I've got mine ready to submit."" That was my good old boy from Sector Three. He'd never had a scrap of trouble in his life down there, and he wasn't about to start now. At least, not while the rest of us were still not dead. Sector Three was not the best. It was not yet on track to being the best. But, if this all went to hell like it absolutely would, that crappy piece of hexagonal metal we call a research facility would be the very last sector to ever fall apart. I knew it.

So, needless to say, I did not ask for the report from Sector Three. I had to save the best, and quite possibly only good, news for last. ""Thank you, but no. Sector Twelve!"" I called out to the supervisor of our primary manufacturing facility. They'd been forced to work overtime since the Talsk cage went up, scrambling to get at least a reasonable facsimile of all our systems' more critical components out of prototyping and into the production stage.

I wasn't stupid enough to think it was impossible, not with a treasure trove of raw materials and the best scientists and engineers in the whole Krakotl Alliance to work with, but god damn was it gonna be hard. ""Yes?"" the hard-eyed supervisor asked.

""Submit your report. No pressure, Twelve."" Overseer Twelve already knew that her sector was the one that really mattered. She was more important than anything else, except for, you know, the life support. If Twelve and her crew couldn't crack their dilemma in time, everybody was going to fucking die. So, yeah, no pressure.

""My report is as follows,"" O-12 began. ""The engineering and industrial capacity of my sector is, in short, insufficient to meet this facility's projected needs right now or in the future. Further information can be relayed at your request, director."" Well, that settled it. We were screwed.

*Well, that really does settle it. We do seem to be screwed.*

""Well, that settles it. We're screwed!"" O-5 yelled, slamming her fist on the table. I swear, that woman picked up way too much from the Krakotl she worked with. ""We're all fucked!""

""Overseer!"" I snapped, turning in her direction. I couldn't blame the fucker for being pessimistic, I sure as hell was at the moment, but we were better than this. ""You are a Farsul. Not a Venlil, not a Kolshian, not a Krakotl, but a Farsul. The best and brightest of the Orion arm. I expect you to conduct yourself accordingly. Is that clear?""

O-5 sunk sheepishly into her chair. ""Clear, director. Transparent.""

""Good,"" I said, turning to O-12, who was still the only person besides me who really mattered. ""And how far will your engineering sector be from meeting this facility's demand for spare parts?"" Really, I was asking how long we could delay the inevitable. There wasn't any shame in it. I was a Farsul. My peoples' lives, especially after the disaster at Talsk, were far too valuable to be unnecessarily lost.

""About an eight to twelve percent shortfall initially, but that number is projected to rise exponentially as systems fail around the facility and in S-12 itself."" O-12, overseer of S-12, took out a holodisk and projected a graph before us so we could look at it and act like we knew what the funny line meant. Strangely enough, it was named G-12. I wondered if there was something concerning about that.

""Keep in mind, this is with optimum performance. The plan I've outlined is superior to all others my team and I developed, but it still fails to meet the demands that necessity has imposed on us.""

Well, yes, I was kind of expecting that. Both parts of it, as a matter of fact. It would've been stupid, and, as such, out of character for her to say we were all doomed no matter what we did and then list off a detailed and well-researched plan of exactly what to do so we would not end up doomed.

Kinda would've been nice, though. Definitely better than what we had now. So, you know, there was that. ""Director?"" O-8 had raised his paw. I pointed at him.

""Yes, overseer?""

""What is the... uh... contingency plan for this outcome?"" *Oh, you poor naive son of a bitch.*

""Well, truth be told, that was the contingency."" God damn, I could *feel* the light leave her eyes. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody found the bitch sucking on the barrel of a firearm two hours from now. *That report is gonna suck to read out loud.*

Sector Eight, which dealt with our submarine fleet, was going to be the first one to go once our spare parts ran dry. We'd scrap its submarines for, well, scrap, shut down its lights, disconnect it from life support and electricity supplies, and eventually just salvage the whole place like  an organism during the last stages of starvation. Consuming its own muscle mass and organs just to stay alive. I did not think that was a pretty way to go.

""Oh,"" O-8 said, her eyes darting around the room ""I... have an alternate contingency in mind.""

""Well, if it means something better than starving to death over the course of several years while our facility falls apart around us, then let's hear it,"" I said. ""Because that is what *will* happen with the current one.""

""Well, look, the Kolshians are losing."" We all knew that. All it really meant to us was that Talsk would stay in a cage, our facility would stay secret, and we'd be forced to jury-rig system after system for the next three to six years, cannibalizing parts and stripping down entire sectors to keep this behemoth alive before eventually it all gave out and everyone who had survived the slow decline got to die all at once in one rapid descent into oblivion. So, yeah, not good. ""None of us here can deny, especially in the wake of O-12's report, that rescue from the outside is a necessity.""

""Well, who do you suggest we ask? The predators?"" O-2 asked.

""Actually, now that you mention it..."" You see, if we were another species, we would've all lost it at that. But we were not. We were Farsul. Superior to all other forms of life. And we acted befittingly. ""The fact of the matter is that we cannot survive on our own. Without supplies like microtubes, carbon-fiber lattices, triple-bonded filaments and many others, we won't last the year without suffering irreparable losses."" She looked around the room, sure in her beliefs. ""After that, it will be only two years at most before half the people in this facility are dead. After that, one. Then total collapse.""

""What this means is that we have four years to consider the possibility of letting humans aboard this station,"" O-9 told everybody. ""We can't make such a rash call without the utmost necessity guiding it.""

""I'm surprised you're considering it at all!"" O-4 exclaimed. ""They'll destroy everything this facility stands for!""

""Like we are in any place to continue our mission right now!"" O-8 countered, defending her point with newfound vigor. ""Like it or not, Nishtal is ash. This facility's directive has shifted irreversibly to preserving the survival of the Krakotl species.""

""Yes, survival!"" said O-4. ""Survival as good, proper, well-molded prey, prepared and ready to fit into the niche we designed them for! Human interference would destroy all of that!""

O-8 kept her composure. It would've been odd if any of us lost it. ""With all due respect, O-4, human interference is on track to destroy our work whether this facility reveals itself or not.""

""Look, maybe it's not necessary to contact the humans,"" O-5 butted in. ""For all we know, O-12 could have misread the findings. We could be able to last a lifetime down here.""

""Yes, that's it!"" O-8 exclaimed sarcastically. ""Plan for a happy coincidence. Because that is precisely what this species' best analytical minds come up with in their time of crisis."" She looked around the table and stood up. ""The Talsk archive was discovered. Likewise, we can safely assume that no undersea facility is safe from subsequent attack.""

""So, that gives us three options,"" she continued. ""One: we wait down here until our systems fail and we all die. Two: we wait down here until the humans find us, they attack our facility, and we all die. Or three: we go to them on our terms, negotiate amnesty for the staff in exchange for our data and genetic vault, and we don't all die."" She threw her paws up and sat back down. ""Frankly, I can't believe this is still a topic of discussion.""

""We all die either way!"" Another overseer yelled. ""They will *eat us!*"" Hell, I didn't know what to believe anymore. I had to admit, O-8's idea of bartering the vault filled with extinct species' genetic sequences for our freedom did hold water, kind of like a bucket that had been left out in the rain, but at the same time I didn't want to associate myself with *those* types of sapients. The forward-eyed kind, mind you. They were just so far below us.

""It's better to safeguard our data and our genetic sequences to the death than to give them to our enemies, let them kill us anyway, and then let them use the data to undo the progress we have made!""

""That progress is being undone regardless!"" shouted O-8, standing up again. ""Two short years ago, Nishtal was a fortress! The Cradle was impregnable! To even think of an enemy reaching Talsk, much less conquering it, would be enough to get you thrown into a padded cell!"" She pointed at the one who had challenged her. Then around the room. ""Like it or not, my associates, we are not going to win this war. How much of our work survives the inevitable defeat depends on how willing we are to adapt to the times.""

""Director,"" she addressed me, regaining her cool and collected demeanor. ""We all came here to fulfill the Farsul mission. We cannot do that if we are dead. Neither can we do it if we are isolated underwater. As strange as it may sound, contacting the humans and re-entering the galaxy at large is our most likely chance at both survival and furthering the goals of the archive program.""

""That's a naive belief,"" another overseer, who appeared to have near-unanimous support behind him, countered. ""Predators cannot be trusted. They have no reason to keep us alive, every reason to kill us, and every reason to use our research against the objectives we were sent here to fulfill. I'd rather die fighting the humans than die giving them what they want."" Just about everybody seemed to agree with that. But, in times of crisis, democracy always took a back seat.

""Director,"" a third overseer said. ""As per station protocol, the final decision is yours.""

I looked up. At the glass ceiling, stained with flecks of ash that had drifted down through the sea. Ecological reports had educated me well enough to brush aside the foolish hope of seeing a fish or two swimming outside. Besides, no sunlight could reach this deep. Only the station's external lights illuminated the vast abyss above me.

I could just barely make out the vast, blinking shape of the communications array not far above. Maybe twenty, thirty meters? Something like that. But, god, what the hell could I use it for? *Could* I use it? Hell and damn, the indecision was paralyzing.

""Director?"" What the hell was I going to do? ""Director, you have the call."" Yes, I knew that. But what the hell was I going to do? If I could not reach a decision soon, I was probably doomed to sit in this chair until the whole station failed. And my last fucking moments would be spent staring at the cold above.

(Doing a two parter here, have fun)

\*\*\*

*“Kilner-Saf, come in Kilner-Saf.”*

Bij held the comms to his smirking mouth, squeezing through an opening in the cave. “You don’t have to talk like that, Heni.”

*“Kilner-Saf, please use the designated callsigns.”*

Bij’s smirk turned into a chuckle. “All right, Kilner-Nik. Reading you clearly.” He scratched his beard, securing a rope around a nearby rock formation. “I’m making a further descent, found another drop here.”

*“Affirmative, Kilner-Saf. Please use caution.”*

“I will, I will.” Before moving down, he dropped a disposable light from his pack. Still a long way down, but he was getting closer. Bij latched the rope to his harness. “Making descent now, nearing the target.”

The opening above faded the more he descended, eventually leaving the torch on his helmet as his only source of light.

All he could hear was the sound of rock beneath—technically, aside from his boots. It wasn’t the first time he had abseiled somewhere like this, but there was always an uneasy feeling that came with it. Nothing major dwelled in these caves according to his scans, but that often left his imagination to wander.

*“Kilner-saf, do you have your gun ready?”* Heni asked.

“Yeah, yeah. All loaded. You don’t have to keep checking on me every few moments.”

*“Just keeping you frosty, Kilner-saf.”*

He snorted. “All right, Kilner-nik.”

Bij suddenly came to the end of his rope, or maybe the formation had gotten it stuck somehow. It was only a short drop; he could still get back up somehow.

He unlatched, cursing as he fell onto the hard ground. Heni spoke again over the comms, *“Kilner-Saf, status?”*

Bij groaned. “All fine. The rope came up short.”

*“Do you require assistance, Kilner-Saf?”*

“They’re only a few scratches. I’m fine.” He pulled himself up. The torch suddenly started flickering. “Dammit.” Bij hit it a couple of times before it stabilised.

He gazed at his new surroundings. Rock, more rock, and a few shiny rocks. He sighed to himself; the only way was deeper in.

Bij dropped a few more disposables along the way, they should have lasted half the day, made sure he was able to see his way back.

“Kilner-nik,” he spoke into his comms again. He just about made out his garbled daughter’s voice. “Kilner-nik, I think I’m losing connection with you.” Eventually, it was nothing but static. Not the first time it happened, he just hoped Heni wouldn’t break down this time over it.

After a few more turns, Bij stopped in his tracks. His scans showed some sort of alloy bunching up in a large area. This had to have been it.

His light finally exposed to him a colossal structure, entrenched into the wall, shaped sort of like a triangle. The known symbols of the ancients had been engraved onto the sides, yet they were too weathered for him to read. Still, he smiled. After all these years searching, he finally found an Imperial Vault.

Bij tossed a couple more disposable lights forward, checking if there was a trap or such around here. Nothing. Part of him felt disappointed.

He stepped forward. A device, an old console maybe, had been built aside the structure. Something must have sensed him as lined lights shone in yellow across the cavern. A camouflage design from the Ancients, seeming as if their technology blended into the natural plane.

The console suddenly moved, each bit remoulding like glittered clay, extending itself for Bij. He felt something in him try to drag him back. As if it knew the consequences of venturing further in.

Of course, he wasn’t going to let this search have been for nothing. He pushed onward, hesitating at first before his hand dug into the console. A cold feeling came over him as it enveloped around his arm. Not the first time he handled technology like this, but he still remained wary of it.

It soon receded. The ground rumbled as the structure split, opening up for him. The lights inside spread outwards as if they were the gateway to the Five Heavens. He scrambled through his things for the camera, the excitement causing him to take a rushed photo.

Bij felt a bliss he hadn’t felt since his daughter was born. So many new possibilities laid ahead of him, all he needed to do was take a step forward.

\*\*\*

Allen refreshed the page again. “Yeah, it’s still not coming through.”

Stan Becker, one of the BSC directors, clicked his mouse a few more times on his end. *“Try now.”*

Once more, Allen refreshed his emails. “I’m getting nothing. No wait, hang on…”

*“You have it?”*

“Hot singles in y—” He paused. “No, just spam.”

*“How are you getting spam but not normal emails?”*

“Ran into some Yntal pirates yesterday, screwed with our communications. We’re getting some things through, but our engineers are having a hard time sorting the rest out.”

*“How does that work?”* Becker asked before sipping his tea.

“I don’t know, I’m not an engineer am I?”

*“You’re a captain of a starship.”*

“And all I do is paperwork, Stan.” Allen refreshed again. “Most of it is just sorting spreadsheets on my computer. I’m not exactly dashing like Captain Kirk or anything.”

*“I wouldn’t call Keith dashing.”*

“What? No, not Keith Kirk, Captain Kirk. From that old show, you know?”

*“I haven’t a clue what you’re on about, Alan.”*

“Leave it,” he sighed. “Try tomorrow or something, we should have our comms sorted by then.”

“I’ll try to remember,” Becker said. “Things been fine the last few weeks?”

“Most of it was spent leaving UN space. We’re probably…” He checked the corner of his computer. “Ninety-eight, nearly a hundred light-years into uncharted territory. How’s things back home?”

*“We haven’t had to lay off anyone this week. Thank God for that.”* Becker leaned back on his chair, eyeing some people rush by his office windows. *“You see what happened with the PM?”*

“I’ve just been focussing on what’s going on here. Why, what’s happening?”

*“Survived the vote of no confidence yesterday. Just by two votes in parliament, can you believe that?”*

Allen gave a nod, he wasn’t surprised. “I’ve stopped looking at the news now, to be honest.”

*“Apparently, they’re talking about getting Queen Vic to dissolve Parliament.”*

The Captain chuckled. “Can’t do that. People will remember that our country *has* a monarchy and get pissed off about it.”

*“It’s either her doing the royal crap or we stage an armed revolt. Not many options to get rid of Pendown.”*

“Shove her in a fridge like she does her kids. Teach her a lesson.”

Becker laughed. *“Speaking of which, how’s His Highness doing on board?”*

“Erm… fine, I guess. I don’t really speak to Louis.”

*“Right. The Captain can only hang around the officers.”*

He shook his head. “No, I just haven’t had the chance to chat with him yet. I’m not getting any complaints, so he isn’t really worth my time right now.”

“Would recommend it. Get the journalists some attention on us. Christ knows we need it.”

The door opened. Xian barged in saluting. “Captain—”

“Bloody hell, Dan, I have a doorbell!” Allen said.

“Apologies, but we’ve found something of interest. Devon’s coming up.”

Allen felt like having a rant about basic politeness, but his mood quickly changed. “Already?”

*“Okay, I’ll leave you lads to it. Call back tomorrow, same time.”* Becker hung up quickly after.

\*\*\*

A time like this was never not exciting for Devon. Any day that hadn’t been spent staring at subspace readings all day or dealing with the logistics of Reha’s killer plants was borderline paradise. He felt a bit giddy in the lift, feeling an optimism that nearly spiralled out of control.

Of course, this was work. As much as he was good friends with Allen, those hierarchical instincts had began to shut his hype down like an Arvan in a football pub. Devon properly mannered himself as the lift went up to the bridge. JADE should have sorted the presentation of his discovery by now.

The doors opened, and he quickly marched onto the bridge. Captain Allen and Xian took their places in the centre.

“What’s the fuss then?” Allen sat down in his chair as a series of graphics detailing the system appeared on the bridge’s viewscreen.

JADE switched the graphics to detail Grendol IV, in particular a rough map of the whole planet, one of the north-western continents a point of interest marked upon it.

Devon spoke, “Captain, the survey probes have brought back peculiar data. We have managed to discover anomalous readings emanating off this planet.”

“How anomalous?” Allen asked, slightly concerned. “We’re not dealing with a reality-bending event this early are we?”

“It’s unlikely, all we have for the moment are subspace frequencies. It’s an ancient frequency, but very similar to those used by the old Solar Empire. I’m assuming dating back to their final era.”

Allen glared at Devon, suddenly sharing his restrained glee. “Three weeks in and we’ve already found our Great Grandad’s shed. Anything special in these signals?”

“Just codes. Of course, the signal is so old, my team have been unable to decipher them.”

“Right, okay. Have the probes detected anything else? Anything producing those frequencies?”

*“Scans indicated no surface structures,”* JADE said, *“The source of the signal goes much further underground.”*

“Okay, Grandad’s cellar? Never mind.” Allen thought for a moment. “Any theories on what we would be dealing with?”

“Well, it could be many things: a military base, a refuge, we really don’t know until we check it out.”

Everything just had to be vague, Allen thought. “Talk to me about the planet itself, anything we should know to make our lives less difficult?”

*“Continental world.”* JADE detailed. *“Standard nitrous-oxygen atmosphere, with the gravity measured at only 0.95-0.97G. The region of interest is an alpine climate - mountains and forests cover the entire area but temperatures remain less than twenty degrees celsius.”*

“Gives the crew less of a headache,” Xian commented. “Best our people deal with a place more like home.”

“Right, set up a camp down there,” Allen said. “Two shuttles, Devon’ll be leading. I trust him to pick out the away teams. The rest of you, standard protocol.”

The bridge collectively gave their ‘Ayes’ and ‘Yes sirs’ before getting back to work.

\*\*\*

From the large door to the hangar bay, Kumar strolled in. Well, more dragged herself. The armoured suit they forced her to put on was like wearing an active washing machine. Sometimes it bit, sometimes it rubbed to hard, other times it wouldn’t move at all. ‘Adaptable’ was how it was described to her back in the armoury. Maybe she could’ve sued for misleading advertising.

There were a dozen or so in her away team outside the Scilly shuttle. Security members in heavy gear, one was in some sort of bulky armour. A couple science crew members she knew were present; Reha Onshe, Julian O’Leary. Devon she was told was coming soon.

She suddenly fell to the floor. One of the security, masked behind a helmet, rushed over.

“You okay?” He said in a posh voice, crouching down.

“I’m on the floor,” Kumar said, managing to roll onto her back. “I’ve definitely got a dodgy suit.”

“Yeah, I’m not a fan of these models either. It’ll take time for it to get used to you.” He offered a hand.

Kumar suddenly realised. “Robert?”

“Was it not obvious?” Louis’ hand was taken, he pulled her up, helping her balance.

“I haven’t seen you in ages,” she said, just about able to stand on her feet again.

“Yeah, Rune has had us all breathing drills. I’ve been fighting on the Yntal homeworld for the past week in the simulator. Week before was the ruins of Seoul for some reason.”

“Are you feeling okay?”

“I *really* need to lie down, but hey ho.”

Kumar was sat down on a crate as the rest of her team finished up loading the equipment onto the Scilly.

Louis sat beside her, plugging a tablet into the side of her suit. “I’m just going to sort through your specs, make sure nothing’s malfunctioned or anything.”

She nodded. “Okay.”

A bit of silence ensued before Louis asked, “So, first away mission. How are you feeling?”

“Erm…” Again, silence. She had a naff kit and made Stevie Wonder seem like a professional marksman. So, Kumar just said, “Fine. I’m excited as hell for it.”

Unless you were utterly tone-deaf, nobody believed her. Of course, Louis wouldn’t have been different.

“It’s okay to be nervous on your first ground assignment. Everyone here—” He pointed to the team, who had now been religiously stockpiling on automatic weapons, “—Everyone’s had it. Space is scary, there’s no denying that.”

“You’ll be fine, Kumar,” Onshe said, leaning against the shuttle. “I’m serious, most of the time you’re walking around doing research. Anything dangerous is left to his highness over here to deal with. Nothing will go wrong.”

“But what if it *does* all goes wrong?”

“It won’t. Trust me. Five years in this company I’ve worked, the amount of people that actually die on these things are really slim.”

Louis placed the tablet down. “How does the suit feel now?”

“I didn’t f—” Something clicked in Kumar’s back. Then another. Then another. Popping like bubble-wrap. “Oh God.”

“You okay?”

“I think it’s giving me a massage.”

He looked back to the tablet. “Right, let me—”

“No, don’t do anything.” Kumar strained as her back continued to click. As if her spine had been going through a slow power wash.

Louis sighed, tapped a few things on the tablet, and Kumar’s mini spa day came to an end. She passed him a disappointed glare.

“Science Officer on deck!” A security crewman, MacLean, loudly stated, standing up and saluting Devon, who had just entered the hangar bay.

Other than one other security member, everyone else just stood and sat like bored mannequins. Onshe decided to diverge from this, having the audacity to give a little wave.

“All prepped and ready folks?” He asked them.

“All set, Devon,” Onshe said.

“Helmets on and saddle up then. Tell the Iona to prepare their leave. This could be on the verge a massive discovery.” He threw his things inside the shuttle. “Come on people!”

Kumar hadn’t seen him this excited before. Something irked her, though. Devon seemed like he was rushing into things. Sure, he had all the experience. But here, he was as impatient as a child opening up a present two weeks before Christmas.

She just hoped Onshe was right.

\*\*\*

“Kilner-saf,” Heni said on the comms.

Silence.

She tried again. “Kilner-saf, do you read.”

More silence, other than a bit of static.

“Kilner—” She paused with a sigh. “Dad. Talk to me.""

The same. It felt like ages since he got cut off, yet Heni never left the comms. Not for food, toilet break, anything.

Everything was telling her to give it a rest, that she had to prepare for the off-chance her father didn’t make it. But this was her father. Some caving incident couldn’t have stopped him, he fared worse. This was likely a minor setback, nothing harrowing.

Heni grabbed her water canteen from the side. Her throat had gone barren after all that talking.

She finished it off, and went back to attempting contact again. Then something beeped.

It was on one of the radar monitors. Two blips appeared, the readings saying they were quickly descending to the surface.

Heni’s heart rate upped. She cursed to herself, pondering how they could’ve been found. As far as she knew, nobody else had been aware of this world. Their tracks were clean.

She grabbed a loaded crossbow from the side, slung a sack of bolts over her back, and headed off. If her father was still alive, someone had to buy him time.

\*\*\*

“MacLean, you can put your bloody hand down,” Louis told the Leftenant.

“All due respect, Louis, I need permission from a commanding officer,” he said.

“Devon!” Onshe shouted to the cockpit.

The American climbed through the door. “Is this urgent?”

“Braveheart here won’t stop acting like he's at the Queen’s Jubilee,” the Arvan said.

Devon looked at Maclean, who was still saluting. “How long has he been like this?”

“Since we left,” Louis said.

Devon pinched his nose. “Jesus Christ. MacLean, put your damn arm down.”

“Aye, sir.” MacLean finally placed himself at ease.

Turbulence struck the shuttle as it further delved through the atmosphere. Kumar clutched tighter on her seat’s harness. It didn’t help how parts of the suit kept digging into her skin.

Everyone else around her was calm. Some as still as a statue.

The pilot suddenly spoke over the intercom, *“Good morning, ladies, gentlemen and anyone in between, this is your Captain speaking. We are currently now seven kilometres from the surface and descending. As you can now see out your windows there are a lot of… trees. Please keep all harnesses tightly fastened, the cabin crew will not be providing any further services. Landing should take place in the next few minutes, please mind yourselves when opening the overhead baggage compartments as belongings may have moved around during the flight. Thank you for flying with Warp2Holidays.”*

The alpine forests below revealed themselves as the shuttles broke through the clouds. Miles upon miles of untouched greenery spanned surrounding the spiked hills and mountains just a bit further ahead. It did look a bit like Earth, or maybe the colder areas of Arva. Not exotic by any means, but things like that were a blessing for the away teams. Better here than the nightmares of a gas giant.

The Scilly rumbled more as it began to slow its descent. All the security personnel cocked their rifles. Within the minute, the shuttle landed. Security had been the first to the door, Louis, of course, among them.

*“Nothing on the motion detectors for the next hundred metres,”* the pilot said over the intercom.

The doors slowly opened. Louis ordered, “MacLean, Ramsey, take point.”

They both said ‘aye’ and made their way out the shuttle, fingers on triggers and ready to probably start a war with native cavemen.

“It’s clear, sir!” MacLean shouted.

“Acknowledged,” Louis said. “Everyone else, secure the perimeter.”

It took a few other security procedures and the landing of the Iona before Devon gave the go to set up camp. They had been free to take of their helmets, the shields in the suits would have dealt with any pathogens.

Rain was all anyone could smell. By all means, it was a nice break from the ship. Not even the simulators could have brought this authentic feel to their senses.

Kumar helped the others bring the crates out of the Scilly. Her suit at this point upgraded from feeling like a washing machine to the comfort of a clothes rack.

A few temporary structures had been set up. With a lab, living spaces, armoury, a garage; basically a small town had been set up within the hour. Just get some indoor plumbing and a bit of wi-fi in, and this could have been a fully-fledged colony.

The security set up motion detectors and automated turrets on the outskirts. Kumar did ask Devon about it, and he told her, “New world, new threats. We’ve dealt with more than enough alien bullshit to validate these things.”

\*\*\*

“You guys ever read Lord of the Rings?” Kendrick asked, himself working underneath the large frame of the survey car.

Monso finished equipping the armour on his ground kit. “You can read?”

“Not funny,” he said. “You didn’t answer the question.”

The Farahali rolled his eyes, before looking over at the other engineers dealing with the personnel carrier. “I’ve read the first book, then the films. Why?”

“So, apparently, when the author, Tolkien, was writing it, he got a lot of his inspiration from the First World War.”

“Okay? That’s not new knowledge, William.”

“What I’m getting at is how the hell did that play as inspiration?” He rolled back out into the light, his face and hands covered in grime with a bit on his prosthetic eye. “Like you look at all your friends dying around you from mustard gas or whatever, and all of a sudden, you’re thinking ‘Yes, Frodo Baggins’.”

“There was a lot more to it, you know. Old Norse, mythology—”

“Right, I get that, but how did World War One influence him in particular? Like, was… who’s someone from World War One? Christopher Nolan. Did he look at him and think, ‘Sauron’.”

“Nolan was a film director. And Mordor and No Man’s Land were pretty similar.”

“No, I’m pretty sure Mordor was mainly based off of Birmingham. Could’ve stayed home during the war and there wouldn’t’ve been a difference,” Kendrick laughed.

“Look, if you want to do standup, fine, but please come up with better material,” Monso groaned. “I’ve seen Androids come up with better comedy. No offence, Ben.”

“Some taken,” Ben said, clanking another crate of equipment from the Iona onto the vehicle.

Kendrick opened a box of wet wipes from the side. “Well, you’ve never been one for humour, mate.”

“Oh, I’m one for humour. Just not the rubbish you churn out.”

“Name five comedians.”

Monso stuttered for a bit. “Freddy Gantwe, Beatrice Pendown—”

Kendrick tossed a dirtied wipe to the side and interrupted. “No, the PM doesn’t count.”

“She appeared on Roundup.”

“That was a one off event in the nineties. Doesn’t count.""

“She was pretty funny.”

“She was like a deranged hyena wearing Human skin.”

“Fine.” Monso paused for a bit. “Mr Bean—""

“*Fictional character*,” Kendrick sang.

“I mean his actor.” He stuttered trying to remember the name, constantly tapping the side of the shuttle. “Rowan Allison?”

“Atkinson. He doesn’t count, he’s a comedy *actor*.”

“He *was* one,” Ben clarified. “Been nearly three hundred years since he died.”

“Exactly,” Kendrick said. “Stick to the land of the living, Jamie.”

“Ensign Monso!” Leftenant Reha Onshe shouted from the distance. “Prepare the car!”

Monso stuck his thumb up to her, then asked his colleagues, “Right, you sorted all here then?”

“Mhm. Finally abandoning us, are ya?” Kendrick finally pulled himself up.

“Absolutely.” He climbed into the driver’s seat, switching the engine on. ""Gotta remove all the negative people from your life.""

""Oh, piss off, mate.""

\*\*\*

Kumar was placed on the first expedition into the wild, because of course she was. She expected to do the mundane stuff back in base-camp, but no.

At least she was with a few other people in the back of the personnel carrier: some security ensigns, engineers, even Reha herself.

Aside from the slits in the windows, she couldn't properly see outside. The helmet that popped out of her suit didn’t help things either, the heads-up-display continued to find ways to adapt to her preferences and that just about blocked everything.

She stared down at the stun gun in her hands. After last week’s incident with Finch, there was a chance she would be responsible for a mass shooting on the Berners-Lee. In combat, it might as well have been useless, especially if they were to encounter some giant insect or something like that.

“Anyone got any plans for after this?” Reha asked.

“Pub, ma’am,” one security ensign said.

“Pub,” an engineer repeated.

“Kumar?” The Arvan Leftenant turned to her.

The contractor was able to give off a shrug in her suit. “Might video call my parents, haven’t spoken to them in a while.”

“Listen to me, talk to your friends, family a bit more frequently. Just make sure they don’t think you’re dead.”

“I would, but they just drive me crazy.”

“Everyone’s parents drives them crazy, Amy. My parents? They can’t get over the fact I’ve stayed in Britain after all these years.”

“I thought you were from Chester, Reha,” Kumar said, leaning on her lap.

“No, I’ve got the accent, but I grew up in Jes’eva on Arva, moved to Newchester, then old Chester on Earth.”

‘What’s stopped you from going back to Arva?”

“Jes’eva is like… one of the Birminghams of my planet, no offence.”

“Why is everyone comparing their home to mine? First Devon, now you!”

“Oh God, did he really compare LA to Birmingham?” Reha scoffed. “No, LA is more like… I want to say London but that’s too generic, nobody likes London, could compare it with anything.”

“I’m from London!” Said the driver, audibly ticked off.

“Sorry to hear that, Julie. Where was I? Right… Skegness. That’s the UK’s Los Angeles.”

The vehicle stopped, and so did the conversation. Reha stood up, she asked the driver what was going on.

There was a tap on the windows. Then another. Then another. Then another. Then it just got concerningly annoying.

“Are we under attack?” The security ensign asked, rightly confused.

“The front car’s moving the turret,” the driver said.

*“THIS IS AVERY DEVON OF THE HMSS BERNERS-LEE,”* the front car’s speaker boomed. *“WE DO NOT POSSESS ANY HOSTILE INT—”*

Someone interrupted, Kumar thought it was Louis’ voice. *“Erm, sir, do they even speak English?”*

Devon was speaking on the comms now, he cleared his throat. *“All security personnel, take point.”*

Reha groaned. “Over a decade stuck with us, still does things like this.”

The security ensigns carefully made their way outside. Kumar looked through the window as half a dozen personnel, armed with rifles, took cover behind the vehicles.

“The dickhead’s using arrows!” Louis observed, stepping out of the car. He switched his rifle to fire stun rounds, suppressing any urge to go overboard.

“One hostile!” An Android, Cyril, stated loudly. “Twenty metres, up on that rising! Pinging it to your HUDs!”

Louis moved forward. “Lay down stun rounds, Cyril and MacLean with me. Try to take them alive.”

“Aye, sir!” MacLean shouted.

\*\*\*

This was a mistake, this whole ambush was a complete mistake. The arrows did next to nothing, and she had three of the bastards moving towards her.

Energy crackled around Heni. She tried her best to remain behind the cover. Another few arrows were loaded into her crossbow, she fired them without aiming.

The shouting got closer, one of the funny-sounding ones requested to flash her. She didn’t know what that meant but it didn’t sound good. She peeked over, they bickered behind cover of the trees.

The Android of the trio was passed something round. Heni cursed to herself, it was a grenade. If the stories were true, then in the hands of something synthetic, she had to run.

Just as she was about to get up, the grenade landed not even a few paces from her. She cursed.

Heni saw white, her ears rang like the scrapes of machinery. She didn’t think, she couldn’t think. The only thing she was able to comprehend were the hard grass and soil pressing against her cheek.

Something faded into view, the metal of her crossbow, shining like a cheap salvation. Heni extended her arm, her hands tried to reach for it.

“Hey! Don’t you dare!” Something else metal popped into her sight, the Android. Standing tall with an amber eye holding her in place.

The synthetic marched closer to her, Heni’s heart pounded once she managed to understand what was happening. Her bit of salvation was kicked away, picked up by one of the other soldiers.

“MacLean, restrain her,” the one holding her crossbow ordered.

The cold touch of handcuffs tightened around her wrists. Heni was forced to her feet. She was done. She failed her Dad.

They took her near the vehicles. Heni tried her best to squirm out, but even if she could, there would have been six guns focussed on her.

A million scenarios played through her head, just looking at all the equipment here was enough to imagine a good amount of torture methods they would’ve put her through.

“We’ve been shooting at a Human teenager?” One said.

More than ten exited or peered out their vehicles, eyes trained on her like hungry predators. Most of them looked like her, some had beaks and feathers, some were machines.

The one holding her crossbow said, “She had this on her. Design doesn’t seem primitive, more like a bit of sporting equipment.

A bald, bearded one moved closer to her. “Pale, can you get your scanner out?”

A scanner. Great, find all the weak points. A woman, pink skin, moved towards her. She was puzzled by her, staring like a curious animal.

Pale looked down to her device. “Physiology makes her Human, she isn’t Terran, though. Related to us like the Farahali. Only six-percent DNA difference from Homo Sapiens. Her muscles are straining, doesn’t seem to be native to this planet’s gravity. I could find out more with a blood test—”

The next moment, the woman found Heni’s spit in her eye.

“I am hoping to heck that means ‘hello’ in your culture,” the woman said to her.

“Didn’t think there’d be more Humans out here,” another crew member said. “Thought we’d found them all.”

“The Solar Empire stretched most of the Orion Arm, we were bound to find more of our kind sooner or later,” the bald one remarked. He moved closer to her, he smiled, speaking in a low voice. “I know you likely wouldn’t know what I’m saying. But we’re not going to hurt you, these people listen to me. You’re fine.”

Heni, regretfully, decided to speak, “I’m not telling you anything.”

The bald man was still smiling. However, his eyes widened. “Right… you speak English. Why does she speak English?”

She shouldn’t have uttered a word. But Heni was confused, why were they surprised? What in the heavens did that mean for her?

“Well, erm… since you— you clearly know what I’m saying. I think we got off on the wrong foot. Can we offer you a drink? Food?”

“I wouldn’t suggest that, Devon,” Pale said. “I don’t want to test a Mars bar on her digestive system. It could harm her.”

“MacLean, set her down, remove the restraints.”

‘Is that wise, sir?”

“I trust her. She’s harmless enough.”

Heni felt the air flow through her wrists as she sat down on a crate. Devon crouched next to her. “So, let’s start again. I’m Avery Devon, I’m the Science Officer of the HMSS Berners-Lee. We’re explorers, come from a planet called Earth. How about you? I’m assuming you’re not from Grendol IV?”

Heni paused. Her first comment caused enough commotion. She was expecting such friendliness from these people. It had to have been a trick, something to let out sensitive information.

She thought about playing along nicely. She really did.

“You’re not getting a single thing out of me, you hairless bastard.”

Of all the outcomes, why did it have to come to this? Why did she have to scowl at everything?

“I’m going to ignore those last three words, and assume you’re under a lot of stress. Getting stunned does not do nice things to people. So, here’s what’s going to happen, I’ll let you decompress, but right now, you’re coming with us. If we find any of your people, if they aren’t as… poorly mannered, then you’ll be let off. Unless you want to talk now, get comfortable, makes our lives easier, makes your life easier. Is that okay?”

Heni didn’t say anything. She was led into the back of the big vehicle, sitting down next to a brown woman. One of the men that apprehended her sat down with a couple other soldiers.

“Is she safe?” The brown woman asked. She had a gun in her hand, the way it was held, little finger on the trigger, irked Heni. She felt a bit safer once the woman scooted up away from her.

“According to Devon, she’s fine. Needs to ‘settle in’ before answering any questions.” The man said.

“Settle in?” The doors closed as more people climbed on board.

There was a bird woman in the corner, she spoke, “Make her comfortable, Amy.”

“So,” the man said, “How have you been back here? One of the first…” He looked at Heni before correcting himself. “Second people on this new planet.”

“I’ve been sitting on my bum for the past half an hour. Is it bad I’m not more… impressed? Like I see it a lot in the adverts or on social media—”

“You said it yourself, you’ve been stuck in this thing for much of it. Besides, adverts, social media, they always lie.”

“Louis’ right,” the bird woman said. “Like you see something about going on holiday to Malaga or Kuala Lumpur or New Philadelphia, and when you get there, your expectations hyped it up too much and you’re completely disappointed. You got the naked eye seeing everything without photoshop. The drinks look boring, the food looks dry.”

Heni looked up at the people. Was this a torture method? She had heard of something like this, she would get herself comfortable, and that wall she set up would come crumbling down. And then her Dad was done for.

A couple of the other soldiers glared at her, Heni reeled in and made eye contact with the floor. The floor did not judge her.

“How far are we from the signal?” The brown woman asked.

“Ten minutes,” the driver stated.

“So,” the man began, “Any theories on what it could be? Crystal skull? Ark of the Covenant?”

“I don’t know,” the woman said. “If Devon couldn’t guess then I can’t guess. I’m just here as extra staff.”

They were focussed on the site. They were targeting the vault. She had to stall them, long enough for her father to get out.

She gazed toward the handgun in the brown woman’s lap. As they continued to bicker about holidays, Heni darted towards it. The grip in the woman’s hands was fragile, it was like stealing from a baby.

Heni held the handgun correctly. Once more, she had a defence.

About five barrels were trained onto her nose.

“Perfectly harmless,” the man said.

Hope this year is a good smelling one for you, and I'm happy to help you find your new signature scent! All decants will come in appropriately sized [glass spray bottles](https://imgur.com/ZCJL1pI) (1 mL sizes will come in 2 mL bottles) with graphic labels. 15 & 30 mL decants will come in thick glass spray bottles. Any 10 mL decant can be upgraded to thick glass (15 mL capacity) for $1.

See [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11axSoCRnA8C3-pRLROJ-UrQkFtRazWC5fYRuzaQqH5M/pubhtml) version of my list for all prices (including 15 mL prices - had to omit from this post due to character limit) along with note breakdowns and other helpful info to help you find scents to your liking.

Payment accepted via Paypal/Venmo F&F or Zelle. $5 flat shipping per order to USA. All prices in USD. Sorry, no trades.

If you like surprises and/or dislike making choices, I'm happy to curate a custom surprise bundle for you. Throw some money my way and provide some general preferences, and I'll assemble a bundle of decants (my choice) worth 110-120% of whatever amount you send me.

Next Generation Network Market is Dazzling Worldwide and Forecast to 2030 ,Nim2908,1hx7vm1,2025-01-09 02:52:15,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nim2908/comments/1hx7vm1/next_generation_network_market_is_dazzling/,TerribleSell2997,,"**Next generation network market** is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period (2023-2030).  A next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network that can provide services including telecommunication services and can use multiple broadbands, and quality-of-service-enabled transport technologies. The growing adoption of next generation network with the improving software-defined Network (SDN) is the key factor supporting the growth of the market globally. Traditional wide area networking requires dedicated, proprietary vendor hardware to be installed at each customer site. New managed service is based on generic hardware capable of supporting a choice of software-based networking solutions from different vendors. Hence, the market players are also focusing on introducing software defined network services solutions that further bolster the market growth. For instance, in November 2020, BT Solution launched a new generation of cloud-optimised managed network services to expand multinational customers’ choice of software-based connectivity solutions. This gives customers a single view of their entire network and a choice of management controls.

Among the end users, the internet service provider sub-segment is expected to hold a considerable share of the global next-generation network market. The segmental growth is attributed to the growing influence of the packet-based network that is able to provide telecommunication services and able to make use of multiple broadband, QoS-enabled transport technologies. Market players brought together hundreds of executives and technical experts from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) industry to discuss all-optical networks, digital transformation, and green solutions, aiming to create a smarter, greener, and more resilient Internet infrastructure. For instance, in April 2023, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. launched its next-generation Internet network infrastructure products and solutions, including Huawei FTTR OptiXstar F30, a full series of 400G OTN solutions, the industry's first commercial 50G PON solution, and NetEngine 8000 F8.

In 1966 he began the Golconda protocol. The mission of the protocol was to spread Golcondist ideas all across Merkopa starting by funding extremist Bludish groups. Then he began sending Golcondist refugees into morella, Lespia, Valgsland, and Sordland in hopes of eventually converting them to the faith of Derdia. Derdia gained parts of northern morella after the Hiotecca War of 1969(named after a  morellan general). His people are all strict followers of Golcondism and are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. In the battle M’orn Derdian soldiers and citizens charged at the better equipped conscripts of morella who were slain with swords and in some cases bare fists.

"Christmas Day is a weird day to start a new community but I'm bored, and there's no family to be with this year. I'm pretty focused on trying to build a very niche small business around Microcontrollers and SBC cases, and some SBC's but money is tight, luckily SBC's aren't too pricey. ",ARMasTheNewDesktopPC,1hlz8o9,2024-12-25 06:39:18,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARMasTheNewDesktopPC/comments/1hlz8o9/christmas_day_is_a_weird_day_to_start_a_new/,Waste-Fix859,,"I've been thinking it over for months what to spend a pretty fixed income on, and I had made up my mind - with one of the larger purchases - an AnyCubic M5s being a huge mistake because it's done nothing but print 6 things 6 months ago, Die, and then have ShenZhen Customer service Annoy me ever since. I know this is a little off topic but why is it that there's a super serious issue with a rather expensive Resin printer within the first week - practically the first 2 days of having it and instead of saying ""Ah can you send that back? I want our tech's to look it over and we'll send you a new unit"" - instead they sent a new display - cause it had wicked burn in (MSLA display filter resin printing) and I said sure a display, but that's clearly not what caused the display to have burn in, in less than a week, I'd like a better solution please, and after 2 months of kicking the can, a new display arrives, and an FEP sheet. THATS IT. And I install it, the motherboard is not intact, there's a break on the hinge, so the display can't be installed, I tell them, thankfully immediatly send out a new motherboard, but I'm noticing dust and my not so great install of the display at this point but thinking, well I plan to print structural components of stuff, such as transparent side panels for SBC Mini Desktop Cases, or what I call consolized SBC's, where you take one that's not that new, but can play MOST retro games just fine, so you make it look like the console/Consoles it plays best, which I like this approach. To give some background I had taken Comp sci in 2012 and kind of hated it, Learning CS languages back then just to write bland apps that sure I could've found a niche back then but I was not impressed with any avenue it was going to lead down, and realized I could've used my artist abilities better at becoming a game designer - but regardless - I'd argue being in Comp Sci now would be a blast. I have bins and bins of tech all around me right now with deliveries frequently containing sensors, micro controllers, and the odd SBC, I wish I could afford more SBC's and do reviews etc, but it is what it is for the time being until I get a cash flow moving again. Prior to beginning a slow approach to teaching micro-controllers for use in my initial 10 projects to help educate people on modern comp sci, since Co-pilot is like the calculator for code. So it's more about the Feature set, and concepts than syntax, and this was always true, but you still had a lot more to remember, just because of the language which now you can get by just knowing how to proof read Copilot.

So nevertheless, I started this because I was getting sick of the RK3588 & RK3588s boards becoming the only dominant board available for every competitor to Raspberry pi. Furthermore, when the Rasp-pi 5 was announced and shown off, I was so - annoyed. I don't really like the company anyway because of their Apple cult like following that thinks it's the best even if it's just another computer and there's nothing that special about it. I get that it's nice that their engineers actually work on software for their OS, COOL. But the ""community"" is just as available there, as it is for say - Orange Pi. And I find Orange has more OS per board, more boards that have varrying price and variety. 

Let's Talk about Orange Pi actually. So when I decided it was high time I stopped gathering big x86 PC's, and was looking into mini PC's mostly AMD laptop SoC's in a 4x4 form factor, but have obviously changed to ARM, and also Risc V but RV still has it's ways to go, but I have plenty of it anyway. I actually did a mild amount of research - or maybe to others its lot's of research I really don't know. And the Orange Pi 5 4, 8, 16GB LPDDR4 boards just launched. I decided to buy an 8, and after getting steam working, and playing some x86 games on it, with shockingly great results, I chose to order a 16GB because of the GPU and CPU sharing ram etc, and I actually wasn't even aware of the NPU's at the time. I just saw the first SBC that had definitly beaten the Raspberry pi 4B (which granted, they have some secret sauce in their quad cores, that it took an octo core with dual ram modules to beat it) - I saw an NVMe port, 8 cores, misread the GPU as something better but am still impressed by it, and was happy with my purchase, until both broke out of nowhere and I'm still mad about it. - irregardless I went on - before they broke, and after to buy 7 total H618 boards, talk about their names later, a 3B 8GB, a Pi One cause I wanted to see where it started vs where it was at now, but also did some shopping around and realized - Quad cores for days. Just monumental amounts of boring 1, 2, 4 GB quad cores that rarely exceeded 2Ghz everywhere. I was actually perplexed until the 5B had come and passed and then the 5 plus came out and with a 32GB model that I'm actually annoyed they're far harder to get now, and the price is a bit obsurd, but my brother got me a 16GB Pi 5 plus, with the 256 emmc, and a power supply, which I was repeatedly - like a brat I do not care, I had 2 PSU's obviously, and wanted the same version but from Aliexpress so I wouldn't need to order the case and the wifi seperately, which I still haven't ordered the case and wifi and it's been a year today. I've not once turned the damn thing on, and it pisses me off that what at the time would've been literally 100$ LESS going from amazon to aliexpress for the 16GB + 256 emmc + wifi 6 BT 5.2 + aluminum case that double's as heatsink and should keep me from thinking it was a bridge of some sort that killed my other pi's. Regardless, I'm going to just find a cardboard box for now, put a couple fans in it, and wires through, so I can get Orange Pi OS droid running, and look into Switch emulation, Winlator performance, Wine, box86/64 with the most recent Graphics drivers, and I've never actually used Orange Pi OS of any kind. To me at the time the Pi 5 series was so unstoppable, and it's still killer, with the 5 pro being pretty good, having it's obvious disadvantages but making the original pi 5 look dumb, and the 5 max being honestly a very appealling board because of the form factor, the full 2280 nvme gen 3, emmc, 2.5Gb RJ45, and some unknown to me difference between it and the ultra which costs more - and the only noted difference is a reduction from HDMI 2.1 to just 2.0 - ok. But anyway my reasoning for testing emu's today, and Android gaming, x86 emu, then trying openFyde to see about having the playstore and steam at the same time - I was told that's possible, I don't know if true. Because I've decided to put a CM5 on a Nano B carrier, using a 4.3"" 800 x 480 Mipi DSI touch display, a 5000mAh PiSugar battery, 2 Gyroscopes on the outter edges, a small cutout for the smallest blower fan to show off the smallest amount of RGB, a second PSP/3DS analog that will have force sensitive sensors beneath that when triggered at - idk 5 KG of pressure will trigger R3, L3 and be analog actually, same goes for a additional edging of plastic with a small gap to make a more pronounced but still sleek R2, L2 that are TT223 touch pads (2x) with FSR sensors underneath also allowing for those to be analog triggers also. Leaving every other button alone, except for the addition of 2 more button underneath the 4 face buttons like - white and orange - on a black PSP, and black and orange on a white, because I love the xbox and emulating every console means doing it comfortably, As well, no touchpads, or anything mouse controls since the mechanism inside a gyro airmouse (wether it's just a gyro and software, or a microcontroller, gyro and software, will be used to make the mouse on the display, or use of the 1 ToF sensor to measure movement also as a motion sensor sorta like the big lights somehow being detected on the PS4 controllers. Which there will be an ESP32-C6 supermini with breakout added, and a S3 supermini which has no breakout, and an H2 just for the other wireless connections, using the C6 to connect controllers and wireless displays, and the S3 for being the controls that will plug into the CM5, which I'll be prototyping it all with a cheaper 4GB CM4 from orange, and then stabbing at a 16GB CM5, and I wanted to do it like this, by completely overhauling it, but just keeping the size and form factor, and after-all I grew up having a modded PSP that was like a smart phone to me, it actually bewilders me how powerful a PSP STILL IS, and the 1000 only had 32MB of ram, and 2 actual CPU's because multiple cores was not a thing yet, or was only just beginning, to the point that a measure of modern ARM emulation worth for a long time was how well it could emulate ghost of sparta and chains of olympus which just goes to show how incredible of a leap that handheld was (especially fascinating was the UMD's which I do Wish the vita kept the trend going with smaller - but Blue ray discs in a UMD case - with a smaller opening, that was sturdier, I get why going back to cartridge makes sense and ultimately glad for it otherwise it only be by soldering on a mSATA port or getting the GSM 3G model could we have non-retard priced memory. But that's yet another ARM PCB that I also love, having it beside me here, with tons of Armv6 and v7 games ported to it, which goes to show stating you will bring bioshock to vita, but then bringing it to iOS and Android is literally no different (if rennigatemante would do the bioshock android, and my god can anyone please port cod blops zombies already - what an amazing title for the vita) I digress. 

So I've had ambitions to take a powerful ARM cpu board and make a handheld for a while, and the PSP project will be commercially available to a degree, I mean CM5's are not cheap from Orange or Radxa, and the CPU is old, that I'm actually looking into grabbing slightly more expensive Snap 8 gen 2, gen 3 SoC's that are fine, but the display of that phone is destroyed or something, and then just squezing it into a PSP, adding a BT controller with the phone and controller both being hooked up to a secondary battery to keep them in sync, or imo what would work best, is a samsung device with Dex, run a USB C adapter that the display get's plugged into, the controller into, and then just supply a heatsink and your done. I couldve gotten several snap 8 gen 2's for 150CAD each at a point I feel very dumb for not doing it now. But even then there's another new CPU for phones dropping with a 3.2 million antutu score, and if it's possible to emulate windows, and run fallout 4 at max settings on a snap 8 gen 2 which is under 1.4 million antutu, maybe less - I'm expecting to play cyberpunk on this new one. And today I'll see what 0.6  million can do haha, atleast the nvme is fast I guess. 



Too all of you who read my random bored post, merry christmas, or happy holidays to people who think christmas is dumb and stuff. 

What's your opinion on the current state of the ARM desktop? Is it now viable with the Orion from radxa, having a 12 core, high end CPU. and ray tracing running at low watts, but it also looks a lot like the 5 ITX so I'd expect 130-300 watts to power SATA drives most likely. 

And do any of you own a 2A, or 2F, if so how many GB of ram? and what FFC HAT's - adapters have you tried with it? I'm thinkinng of buying 2x 2F today, which in CAD is 22$ for a 2GB, x2 + 20$ shipping on aliexpress, so 32$ for each 2GB, vs 46 for the 2A 2GB, the 2F 4GB is 36$ same shipping, so also considering 2 of those, there's also a Zimaboard 2GB 32GB emmc for only 120 CAD + 20 shipping, and a 99$ no RAM (which I'd prefer tbh) similar shipping, and taxes cause amazon, but there's a 30$ off coupon, so my measly 99$ could actually afford it. Sucks to be christmas and There's no one to give you a card with a 20 slipped in it guys. My mom recently passed, right after my 6 years younger than me nephew, and my dad just isn't a good person so not even worth saying anything too, I have 1 brother that talks to me and he's a judgemental cunt at the best of times, and my sister is - dramatic. Either way, I've gotto make a lot of money, very quickly, so I'm really glad Canada post is now serving international mail again, and my 67 orders from aliexpress are finally being delivered, with a few electronics tool kits I'm building up to make a very sleek and well designed electronics + 3D printing tool molle pouch with minor loot box mechanics. As well as having my M5s finally get a new display shipped in, and HOPEFULLY the pos will work again, then I can print the cases for my half dozen ESP32-CYD that I'll be adding batteries too, a LoRa module, a large antenna, the stylus will go in like a DS, instead of these awful clasp shells. And I sorta hope I can still have it run Gameboy as well as run marauder so I can sell it for over 100$ on etsy, I watched a guy sell 34 on etsy(dot)ca for 130 each, like wow that's good profit, since all he did was supply a case, and install marauder. Besides that I've got a nice design for a 3 extruder Robotic ARM 3D printer - that in it's first iteration will not have heated build plates, but if someone wanted to add one, it doesn't need to move at all, just needs white tape around it's edges for the white line sensors to know that's out of bounds, this way it can have multiple materials, nozzles, and colors without purges, and delays to heat up to temp whatever. At 50cm tall, or half a M for the print volume, and since it's 1 ARM moving X and Y the reach is just over 50cm, I was planning on a carbon fibre Resin printed structure, but am currently FDM printing the structure for prototyping, I have a Tinybee ESP32 board (huge fan ofESP32's) But also spent the additional money on a Arduino Mega with wifi, aka the 3 microcontrollers on 1 board mega, as well as waiting on 2 UNO's that are the same thing, and intend to actually use the uno's with a 2.4"" touch display for controls, and an ESP webapp as well. Same for the Mega, Got Ramps 1.5 despite ordering 1.6 oh well, got the small screen cause by the time I got the mega, the ramps, and the display, it was 43$ and I didn't even get drivers (mainly cause I have 12 A4988's and am ordering now 5 DRV8825's, and have 10 DRV8833's that don't fit but could potentially be used as external drivers 100% with TinyBee, and 90% sure the same with the mega, cause I'm ordering 5 ofthe driver pop in's as well, and also own a huge amount of other hardware like 30-40 L298N boards, mini and regular, that I could try, I plan to use a set of singular Stepper driver shields, L298P, and then the L293D top shield, or the CNC shield, haven't made my mind up yet, if I go with the CNC shields(I have 2 already, and 2 of the L293D, and 1 of the L298P, and stackable sensor shields which I'm sorta sure can drive servo's but because I wanna be 100% I'm gonna order the slightly more expensive 16 servo board, cause I realized the Means of control for this printer is like this, I'll be using cheap Direct feed mechanism's with either some very awesome Nema 14's I got a long while ago for just 6$, or preferrably because I can't find them that cheap anymore, the 28-BYJ-48's, really wanted 24-BYJ-28 4 wire 12V motors but only easyThreeD sells them (that's where I got my 2 prototyping extruders, and I'll be using 1 Mk8 extruder as the third, but the 24 12v has tons of torque and never failed me, then I'm using 2 DC motors, 1 will be a 550 that gets turned on and off via relay that is triggered via ToF sensor detecting the height of the Gantry on the tower, and given a few seconds after each Z lift it will determine if it needs like 0.1 s of back down readjustment, but it seems like a simple way to go with a DC motor over stepper, and I'll being using a Servo that only need's to do 180\* since that's the maximum range of it's ARM's motion, and all the accuracy lay in the linear actuator which is a control rod, and is attached to the same Spinning Geared disc the servo spins, then the actuator does the fine tuning of the pivot of the exterior arm, and with another sensor on the very end inbetween all 3 extruders as well as for testing using epipolar geometry via 4 ESP cams to see if it's getting it's accuracy right, if not then I'll be adding another servo at 2/3rds of the ext arm, which is fine cause it allows for a slight lowering of the nozzles at that point, which will help with print bed height. 

If anybody knows if the uno idea will work get at me, as its extremely cost effective and the entire point of this printer, is a sub 100$ 3 Extruder - multimaterial, multi color, zero waste, and optional upgrades to stronger structural components, taller printer, with the arm reach 1.2m and the build volume reaching nearly 1m cubed, to say F you to elegoo for charging so much for the awful giga, but also I want to have the ESPnow protocol to eventually allow 4 of these printers to work together on 1 buildplate, as well it can do a complete 360\* with a seperated node MCU to Motor via ESP3D wifi connection to the ESP8266 on the UNO, and then cutting the circle into 8, allowing you to queue up 8 different 3D prints - have a small lider made diy from 1 or more ToF sensors, and a small DC motor spinning it, along with the gantry having a pair of LED's, and a ESP CAM with OV5640 cause the 2640 is just, meh. The L298P doing both DC, the L293D doing both steppers and both servo's. Or if the servo's don't suite the bill, I'll switch to 2 L298P shields, or even 3, I don't wanna spend 20 bucks on the new 2 stepper 2 servo shield. when the L298P which sure does just 1, but is around 5$ so that's 4 for the price of 2. 

  
These passed 2 years have been the most fun I've had with my computers ever because of clustering, teaching, and learning all kinds of crazy new things about Risc V, and ARM, as well as Xtensa, and even x86. I'm 100% getting a 12-16GB RAM Radxa X4, I also intend on getting a different x86 board, as well as the NIO 12L, and a Risc V board that has to also be pretty thin, but no matter what this handheld will be thiccc, I call it the threesome, cause it'll have 3 different kinds of computers, each having 16-32GB of RAM, being water cooled, yes that's right, a handheld with actual water loops, running via DC motor pump, through those extra tall NVME air heat sinks, that I'll run a zig zagged hot end of the loop through, as well as using 1  Switch Lite copper and blower per system for added heat reduction. 

  
I ask one of you out there though, to help me work on something very important for that project. DM me to find out - will need a good amount of PCB design, Software understanding, and I can't say much more without giving away what I want to build, but I've been looking into adding FPGA's let's put it that way.

First post. Board off my rocker. The posts will get more coherent as time rocks on.

# Introduction

In today’s world, most communication happens online. With this shift, hijacking of communications is a serious threat. In this worrying trend, attackers take advantage of vulnerabilities to get unauthorized access to sensitive information. This can disrupt operations and lead to big financial and reputation issues. In 2023, there were 3,205 publicly reported data compromises that impacted an estimated 353,027,892 individuals, representing a 78% increase over 2022. The effects of these attacks can be severe, with data breaches costing businesses an average of $4.45 million in 2023, an all-time high and a 15.3% increase from 2020. As we rely more on digital communication, it’s important to keep these channels safe for both businesses and individuals. The urgency is clear, as 45% of Americans have had their personal information compromised by a data breach in the last five years.

# Understanding Communications Hijacking in the Digital Age

[**Communications hijacking** ](https://dataforceteam.com/preventing-communications-hijacking-data-defense-strategies/)means taking control of communication channels without permission. This includes emails, websites, social media accounts, and phone networks. Unlike regular hijacking that uses force, this digital version uses tricks like malware, phishing, and DNS manipulation. These tricks help intercept and control how information is shared. The effects of these attacks can be severe, with data breaches costing businesses an average of $4.45 million in 2023, an all-time high and a 15.3% increase from 2020.

The effects of these attacks can be serious. They can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and money losses. They can also disrupt important services. As we rely more on digital communication, it’s important to keep these channels safe for both businesses and individuals. The urgency is clear, as 45% of Americans have had their personal information compromised by a data breach in the last five years.

# The Basics of Communications Hijacking

At its core, communications hijacking takes advantage of weaknesses in internet communication systems. Attackers can manipulate the domain name system (DNS) using a rogue DNS server through DNS hijacking. This redirects users to fake websites that are made to steal credentials, often associated with their IP address. Another common method is session hijacking. Here, attackers take control of an active user session on a website, getting into their data and actions.

Also, attackers can stop and change information sent over networks, like emails, chat messages, and voice calls. They can do this by using unsecured Wi-Fi networks, placing malware on users’ devices, or breaking into network systems.

These attacks can vary in how advanced they are. However, they all aim to get unauthorized access to private information or to disrupt communication for bad reasons.  In 2023, there were 3,205 publicly reported data compromises that impacted an estimated 353,027,892 individuals, representing a 78% increase over 2022.

# How Communications Hijacking Impacts Businesses and Individuals

For businesses, a successful communications hijacking can be very damaging. A breach can mean losing sensitive information. This includes customer data, financial records, and confidential business details. As a result, businesses may face legal problems, fines, and harm to their reputation. Nearly 11 percent of all publicly traded companies were compromised in 2023.

Individuals are also at risk. Attackers often use methods like phishing and social engineering to break into personal accounts. This can lead to identity theft, unauthorized transactions, and large financial loss.

The effects of a communications hijacking are more than just the immediate harm. It can damage trust, disrupt operations, and require a lot of time and resources to recover.

# The Most Common Types of Communications Hijacking

Communications hijacking includes different bad actions. Attackers are always changing their ways to take advantage of weak spots in many platforms and ways to communicate. Because of their changing tactics, it is important to understand the common techniques. This knowledge can help us create good ways to fight back. In 2023, there were 3,205 publicly reported data compromises that impacted an estimated 353,027,892 individuals, representing a 78% increase over 2022.

Now, let’s look at two main types: email interception and manipulation, and the growing risk of VoIP hijacking.

# Email Interception and Manipulation

Email is still a major target. Phishing attacks are a common way that people hijack communication. Phishing uses fake emails that look like real ones. These emails trick you into giving away sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. In 2023, 35% of malware was delivered via email, and more than 94% of organizations reported email security incidents.

Another common method is email interception. Here, attackers get unauthorized access to email accounts. This lets them watch conversations, steal information, and pretend to be the account owner for harmful reasons.

To protect against email hijacking, you need a few steps:

1. Strong passwords and two-factor authentication are needed to keep email accounts safe.
2. Regularly updating software and security patches can help fix vulnerabilities.
3. Teaching users about phishing tactics is important. It’s also essential to be careful when opening suspicious emails.

# VoIP Hijacking: An Emerging Threat

With more people using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), VoIP hijacking is becoming a serious problem. Attackers can take advantage of weaknesses in VoIP systems. They can get unauthorized access to conversations, listen in on sensitive information, and even change calls for dishonest reasons.

The results can be very serious for businesses that depend on VoIP for communication. They can face financial losses, spying issues, and harm to their good name. In fact, over 60% of companies that suffer a cyber attack close down within six months.

To fight this growing problem, both businesses and individuals need to focus on safe VoIP settings. They should use strong passwords and put in place robust detection and prevention measures. This will help keep their communications safe. In 2023, 77% of internet users worldwide worried about personal and sensitive data being stolen, emphasizing the importance of these security measures.



# Real-World Examples of Communications Hijacking

The risk of communications hijacking is very real. There are actual cases showing how harmful it can be. These events remind us how crucial strong cybersecurity is in today’s connected world.

Let’s look at two well-known examples: the SolarWinds hack and the Twitter Bitcoin scam from 2020.

# Case Study: The SolarWinds Hack Revisited

The 2020 SolarWinds hack is a clear example of how dangerous communications can be hijacked. Russian hackers put harmful code into SolarWinds’ Orion software updates. This affected a key part of the supply chain that many organizations trusted. This included government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. The attack impacted nearly 18,000 organizations worldwide.

The attack had serious effects. It gave hackers a way to get into the networks of many victims. This also put sensitive data at risk and could disrupt important systems, leading to potential cyber threats. The scope of the attack showed how important it is to improve supply chain security and conduct a thorough investigation of vulnerabilities. We need a strong plan for finding and responding to threats quickly. The total cost of the SolarWinds breach is estimated to be $100 billion.

The SolarWinds incident reminds us that threats are always changing. It shows the need for constant watchfulness, strong security actions, and teamwork among organizations. This way, we can fight against tricky cyberattacks.

# Analysis: The Twitter Bitcoin Scam of 2020

In recent years, social media platforms have become easy targets for communication hijacking. The Twitter Bitcoin scam in 2020 showed how vulnerable online communication can be. In this incident, attackers got unauthorized access to important Twitter accounts. This included accounts belonging to Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Apple.

They misused these accounts to promote a cryptocurrency scam. They promised followers that any bitcoin sent to a certain address would be doubled. The scam resulted in 383 Bitcoin transactions being sent to the attackers’ account, totaling approximately 12.86 BTC (US$117,000 at the time). Many people fell for this scam, resulting in big financial losses.

The Twitter Bitcoin scam highlights the need for strong security on social media sites. Users must be aware of phishing and social engineering tricks. Social media companies must act quickly to find, control, and reduce such incidents. In the aftermath of the attack, Twitter’s stock price fell by 4% within a day.

# Protecting Your Data from Hijackers

In today’s digital world, keeping data safe is very important. This needs a strong plan to deal with changing tactics from cybercriminals. Using different technology, creating good policies, and training employees frequently is key.

Both organizations and people must focus on security. They should know that acting early is vital to reduce risks and lessen the effects of possible breaches.

# Essential Security Measures for Every Organization

Implementing good security measures is necessary for every organization today. Following best practices can help build strong security, reduce vulnerabilities, and protect against attacks.

Here are some important security measures:

1. Firewall: This is a basic security tool. It checks network traffic and stops unauthorized access to systems and data.
2. Encryption: This keeps data safe when it’s moving or stored. It makes the data unreadable to anyone who shouldn’t see it.
3. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): This adds extra security. Users must provide different forms of ID, like a password and a one-time code, to get in.
4. Regular Security Audits: These are regular checks to find and fix potential vulnerabilities. They help make sure security remains effective.

# Advanced Technologies in Preventing Data Breaches

Using advanced technologies, along with basic security measures, can greatly help an organization stop data breaches and protect sensitive information. These technologies act as a shield. They look at network traffic, how users behave, and any threats. This allows them to find and stop attacks before they do harm.

Here are some important technologies:

1. Web Application Firewall (WAF): This tool filters out bad traffic aimed at web applications. It protects against different attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
2. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): This gathers and studies security logs from various places. It gives a clear view of an organization’s security and helps find and respond to threats quickly.
3. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA): This checks how users and devices act to spot unusual behaviors or threats. By identifying standard patterns, UEBA can catch strange activities that might mean an attack is happening. 

# The Role of Data Professionals in Mitigating Risks

Data professionals are very important in this area. They do more than just manage and analyze data. They also work hard to keep it safe and reliable. These experts lead the way in putting in place, keeping up, and improving security steps to protect important information.

Their job is not just about technical skills. They also offer advice, teach others about new threats, and help build a security-focused culture in companies. They connect the complex technical details with the needs of the business.

# Bridging the Skills Gap in Cybersecurity

The world of cybersecurity is changing fast. This change requires a skilled workforce to fight more complex threats. To close the skills gap in cybersecurity, we need experts in network security, ethical hacking, and data encryption. These skills help stop attacks like IP hijacking and BGP manipulation.

Organizations and schools must work together to solve this problem. They should invest in cybersecurity training programs, promote certifications, and support ongoing learning. This approach helps professionals gain the knowledge needed to handle these changing threats.

By focusing on cybersecurity education and training, organizations can build a team ready to protect against new dangers and keep valuable data safe.

# Dataforce’s Approach to Securing Top Talent

They can join industry events and have a chance to work with experts. By giving our team the knowledge and tools they need, we can set up robust detection and prevention strategies. This helps to effectively shield data from cybercriminals.

# Learning from the Past: Historical Hijacking Incidents

Looking at past hijacking events helps us understand attack methods, weaknesses, and how defenses have changed over time. Each event teaches a rough lesson. It shows us how to improve security, adjust our response plans, and take steps to avoid threats before they happen.

By learning from previous errors, groups can expect new dangers, fix their weaknesses, and handle the tricky world of cybersecurity with more awareness and readiness.

# Lessons from the Past: Preventing Recurrence

Every successful attack reveals weaknesses and shows how future attacks can happen. By looking at past events, we can find patterns in how attacks happen. This includes the weak spots that were used and the problems within organizations. For example, a data breach from the previous year may have started due to a phishing campaign that targeted workers.

When we understand how the attacker got past security, organizations can strengthen their protections. They can set up multi-factor authentication and teach employees to spot phishing attempts.

It’s important to learn from previous mistakes. This is not about blaming anyone but about gathering useful information to stop similar events from happening again. We need a culture of ongoing improvement. Security, like Imperva technologies, should not be something we set and forget; it must be an ongoing effort to adapt, refine, and prevent threats.

# The Evolution of Security Measures Over Time

Cyberattacks have evolved significantly over the years, pushing the boundaries of technology and exploiting new vulnerabilities. The early days of the internet witnessed simpler attacks like DDoS, but today, sophisticated techniques such as ransomware, zero-day exploits, and AI-powered attacks are the norm.

Security measures have had to evolve in tandem, from basic firewalls and antivirus software to advanced solutions like threat intelligence platforms, user behavior analytics, and automated incident response systems. The following table highlights key developments in attack and defense strategies over time:

||
||
|Period|Attack Trends|Security Measures|
|Early 2000s|Simple DDoS attacks, virus infections|Firewalls, antivirus software, basic intrusion detection systems|
|Mid 2000s|Rise of phishing, SQL injection attacks|Web application firewalls, stronger authentication mechanisms|
|Late 2000s|Botnets, targeted attacks|Behavioral analysis, sandboxing, reputation-based security solutions|
|2010s|Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), ransomware|Threat intelligence platforms, advanced encryption, incident response teams|

If you like surprises and/or dislike making choices, I'm happy to curate a custom surprise bundle for you. Throw some money my way and provide some general preferences, and I'll assemble a bundle of decants (my choice) worth 110-120% of whatever amount you send me.

Cybertron's society in transformers one is so damn fascinating!,CharacterRant,1hcvxi9,2024-12-12 16:29:08,40,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1hcvxi9/cybertrons_society_in_transformers_one_is_so_damn/,DeathByDevastator,Films & TV,"Oh Primus those film makers know how to cook a hell hole of a society and hide it behind gorgeous graphics and funny flying robots who scream ""MINERS!!!!!"" with a hatred so great they may just beat all the allegations with that one line.

If you haven't seen peak fiction, quit reading NOW because spoilers are everywhere in this post.

Alright, with that out the way...where to begin?

Ah, yes. The mines. The mines the cogless CHILDREN genuinely do yearn for on Cybertron. 

Sentinel's regime conditions the cogless into believing the mines are the only way forward in their life, and the mines themselves are BRUTAL. Elita 1, the manager of Orion and D's team of miners, is so damn hellbent on following protocols and getting a promotion that she genuinely does not care that much about a subordinate dying in the mines. Sure, she helps save D-16 and Orion, but the protocol is so deeply ingrained that saving a life is seen as bad to Elita. In fact, even fellow miners don't want to save their own kind! The idea of getting promoted is such a big deal to them that they'll genuinely advocate letting themselves perish if it means others can keep following protocol and possibly climb the social ladder. It speaks volumes of the materialistic hellscape sentinel enforces on society; a bots life is determined by their work and nothing more, and as Elita shows that materialistic hyperfixation is in damn near every single bot on iacon. Honestly it's such a good reflection of modern day society it isn't even funny. There's genuinely parallels to be made with the materialism and job obsessions here. Oh, and the miners are casually hollowing out their own GOD for energon to survive. That's goddamned brutal and yet NOBODY questions it. How much pain is Primus in? He must be suffering HARD with all the drills going through him night and day.

The cogless themselves also have a massively terrible existence outside the mines. ""Casually"" leaving the serial newborn organ harvesting antics of Sentinel prime that caused their cogless disabilities, they face constant discrimination from the cogged and especially straight up brutality. Just look at Darkwing the Miner Hater, who frequently abuses the miners he's supposed to care for as their superior, or how the state police mock Orion for being a ""No-cog!"" who can't transform. Speak up, and like Orion and D-16 themselves they're gonna be sent to sublevel 50 for the rest of existence. Poor B went absolutely insane down there and never recovered.

Hell even their cogless disability must be hell for them all. They're forced to travel the paths by foot, must use public transportation and have limited options on where to go. Traffic is a nightmare for them, and yet their cogged brethren rule the roads and the skies just fine without a care. Darkwing truly puts it plain and simple; they have ""Limited Options"", not just in careers, but in everything. They're smaller, visibly inferior, have a LITERAL HOLE IN THEIR HEART and yet they have to give it their all in a mere hope of someday catching up with their superiors. American dream, anyone? 

It's not like the cogged live well either. Something happened to everyone in the know when sentinel took over, there's no chance everyone simply bought sentinel's lies at the time. And yet, we now see drones near sentinel. No explanation is given, but they're faceless, carry out orders like nothing more than a mere machine, and even go as far as having a mechanical voice in a way not even shockwave or soundwave do. 

Yeah, there's no way Sentinel didn't do some kind of horrific mutilation to those bots. He's already shown himself to be a serial organ harvester and a fan of irony, shutting down the unruly by making them mindless and faceless robots with nothing more to them than that seems right up his alley and would explain a hell of a lot. 

Darkwings existence also implies misery for the cogged. His body is shared with two others, yet he's clearly got no connection due to having a far different voice and even a whole different job inferior to that of state police, he's got no friends evidently and even his face has no room to express anything. He's clearly tortured by an inability to climb the social ladder despite being cogged, something which in sentinel's society SHOULD make you live like a king, and he's just one job position above the miners he hates with a burning passion. No wonder he's so spiteful; and it makes you wonder what the other cogged bots feel too.

It's no wonder D-16 goes absolutely psycho; he's bought into the system so perfectly that the moment there's a crack exposed he can't take it at all. The system broke him, and he can't even think of anything other than replacing it's leader with him at the helm instead. It just goes to show how perverse Sentinel's society is, corrupting bots so thoroughly that they are driven to selfishness, hate and violence. 

It really tells you all you need to know that Orion causes the collapse of the system's believability by showing compassion, care and humility; the exact inverse of the very things sentinel built his society around.

The writers cooked so hard with the revolting society sentinel created, and this hasn't even covered how utterly horrifying the fact he sold the planet out to the quintessons is. Maybe that's a rant for another day."
