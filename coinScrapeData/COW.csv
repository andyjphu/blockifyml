Jonos I - Sleep,IronThroneRP,1i9wwwg,2025-01-25 16:00:17,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/1i9wwwg/jonos_i_sleep/,East_Mid7,THE NORTH,"The burning of White Harbor had begun, Jonos could hear the screaming echoing from the New Castle, see troops bearing Corbray and Arryn colors rushing about the city walls, it would be the greatest moment in the history of his house in a thousand years. Artys had played his part perfectly in spite of Jamie's idle threats, soon the Manderly's would be dead and the Arryn's and the Corbrays would be bound by something far more important than blood, they would be bound by *guilt.*


It had taken Jonos decades to get here, decades of cowing to that idiot Jon, decades of dealing with Artys' fickle idiocy, decades of endless work and most of all a mountain of corpses decades tall. He was rather pleased with himself, in truth, practically everything he had planned out when the king had announced his tourney had come to fruition. Some things had slipped between the cracks of course, marriage with the Velaryons, Serena's uncle on the weirwood throne but perhaps that was for the best.


Pouring himself another glass of wine Jonos took a seat in an old leather seat he'd had hauled from Hearts Home for him, it was one of the few comforts of home he'd allowed himself on the campaign trail. *I deserve it* he thought to himself *after all I've done for this family, all I've lost.*


Another glass of wine. The pain in his skull was growing again, throbbing against his brain, dull aches mixed with strange shooting pains that spread through his entire body like spiders web. *Malignant growths* the maesters had called it, strange foreign bodies eating at the inside of his mind. They knew about them from dissecting corpses, cutting open men who'd complained of similar maladies and discovering strange growths inside. If they had been inside his arms or legs they could have just hacked them off at the base and called it a day but these ones grew inside of his skull, as was his luck.


They'd told him two years, that had been nearly a decade ago. It had given his work a sense of urgency, it had been why he'd sent Artys off to Aenar, *gods that was foolish.* The stepstones had been a step in the right direction for the boy, he needed to become a killer and the schoolyard cruelty Jonos had taught him wouldn't be enough. Jaime had salvaged that misstep though, his letters discussing Artys‚Äô temperament had been crucial in stopping the boy from becoming just another summer knight of the capital.


Thinking of that brought a small smile to Jonos' lips, Jaime was a fool, as fickle and prone to outbursts as Artys though with none of his callousness. Being so instrumental in his father's plans weighed on him immensely, a fact that brought Jonos ceaseless amusement.


Jonos‚Äô firstborn may have inherited his father's talent for deception but he had none of the ambition that made it worthwhile. He was like a dull knife, a rounded spear, a practice sword. It was embarrassing, embarrassing for him, embarrassing for Jonos. There had been a time when he thought that his son might be able to take up his mantle, to guide house Corbray to new heights from the shadows as Jonos had for most of his adult life but as the boy had grown older it had become apparent he lacked the stomach for it.


*SNAP*


A sudden noise grabbed Jonos‚Äô attention from his drunken monologue. Something was off, something was wrong but in his drunken haze he couldn't quite place his finger on what‚Ä¶


It was the silence. Even with the levies off slaughtering the Manderlys he should have still been able to hear servants running around the camp, hear his guards idle chatter. All he could hear now was the distant shouting of soldiers in the city and the sound of the ocean wind against the walls of his tent.


*Where were his guards?*


Something was definitely not right, panic began to fill the old man as he stumbled to his feet snatching an old cheese knife from his table and hid it in his coat. At first he tried to stand and appear imposing but the liquor in his stomach began to make his head swim horribly so he was forced back to his seat, instead doing his best to look disinterest in the goings on around him.


*Jonos Corbray was terrified.*"

A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,HealthyZapper,1i9vk1k,2025-01-25 15:00:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1i9vk1k/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,AutoModerator,Keto,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved."

Tribe Hotel ‚Äì Nairobi ‚Äì [https://www.tribe-hotel.com/](https://www.tribe-hotel.com/)

The bathrooms are uh, not good for couples or families. You will hear, smell everything, and see some things.

This hotel is located near the US Embassy and the UN headquarters. It is safe and there is a huge mall across the street. The hotel is clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The bar was lively at night and we enjoyed the cocktails.

We took a tour via UJV and Martin, who took us to the Elephant Orphanage, Giraffe Center, and then the Karen Blixen Museum. ¬†It was nice to see the city while driving between venues. We enjoyed all of these activities but a word of caution with the Giraffe Center that it is more of a zoo than a conservancy. When you arrive, you will be given a dish of food to feed the Giraffes. The Giraffes have options to not interact at least.

Wilson Airport to Amboseli

Angama Amboseli - [https://angama.com/](https://angama.com/)

We flew into the airport within the Amboseli National Park, however there is a private airstrip in the Kimana Conservancy. We were met with breakfast at the airstrip and then were able to see Amboseli before heading to Angama. In a perfect world, I would land at Amboseli and fly out at the private airstrip. It‚Äôs about 1 hour 40 minutes to the airstrip at the national park from Angama. Our guide, Salash, was fabulous! Every game drive was private.

The resort is beautiful and located in the private Kimana Conservancy. The cottages are gorgeous. The bathroom is huge, with a two-person shower and a large room with a toilet and a door! There is an outdoor sitting area and an outdoor shower. The cottages do not get too hot and we were quite comfortable during our stay. James was our room attendant, and everything was perfect. He did far more laundry for us than he should have.

From our room, we were able to see quite a bit of wildlife! Elephants, monkeys, etc. The conservancy does have cats but the elephants, hippos, and all the other animals are why you visit. We were even able to meet Craig!

They don‚Äôt have a gym. They have a pool and offer a ‚Äúgym bag‚Äù in your room. They offer beading, weaving, and photography classes.

Their beverage program was amazing. Lots of wonderful South African wines that we wish we could get in the USA. The food has some room to get better but I figure [u/DorsiaTravel ](https://www.reddit.com/user/DorsiaTravel/)will fix them right up when he visits soon.

This resort needs bug spray.

Lodge 2:

Amboseli to Lewa - We were supposed to fly back to Wilson but the SafariLink added a few stops and flew ‚Äúdirect‚Äù instead.

Elewana Kifaru House - [https://www.elewanacollection.com/kifaru-house-lewa/at-a-glance](https://www.elewanacollection.com/kifaru-house-lewa/at-a-glance)

This lodge has 5 cottages at the top of the hill for great views. The cottages are clean, comfortable, and cool. The weather at Lewa is quite a bit cooler which also means you don‚Äôt need bug spray. They do warn you to keep the lights off at night so that moths are not attracted.

Our guide, Phillip, was terrific. There were issues with the car, so we ended up having an extra guide, Michael, to help drive. All the drives happen within the Lewa Conservancy. We were able to see white and black rhinos, cheetahs, elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes, bush babies, and several baby lions!

The food and beverage were fine, with no complaints. The chef ensured I had fresh-baked gluten-free breads (I have celiac) and even made me gluten-free churros!

Lodge 3:

Lewa to Samburu ‚Äì we had a chartered flight and flew direct (15 minute flight).

Saruni Samburu - [https://sarunibasecamp.com/our-properties/saruni-samburu/](https://sarunibasecamp.com/our-properties/saruni-samburu/)

This lodge is located within Kalama Conservancy but all the animals were within the Samburu National Reserve. During the rainy periods, the game drives would be within Kalama.

This place is magical. Kalama is semi-arid and very hot. Despite this, the rooms were cool at night and we were comfortable. It was very hot during the day but there are two pools to cool down. Because the rooms are built into the side of the mountain, you can get a nice wind tunnel to keep the rooms cool. I will say that this place is not very accessible. If you are scared of heights, have any physical challenges, or younger kids, you might skip this place. They have a great gift shop too!

Samoru was our guide and he was fantastic. He‚Äôs an elder in the Samburu tribe and went out of his way to find us a leopard. We also saw a red spitting cobra, stripped hyena, leopard, rock hyrax, and so much more.

Saitoti was our food and beverage person and he was such an amazing teacher. We learned a lot about his culture and his language! They even had gluten free pasta for me.

Lodge 4:

Samburu to Keekorok (Masai Mara)

JW Marriott - [https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nbomj-jw-marriott-masai-mara-lodge/overview/](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nbomj-jw-marriott-masai-mara-lodge/overview/)

This lodge is located very close to the local community and we could hear goats, cows, and kids playing in the river from our room. The cottages are beautiful. Ours had a (very cold) pool and a sauna. We were also treated with some very cute guests who left us a free presents on our deck, 10 or so baboons!

¬†They have a rotating menu but will make you anything you want with enough time. Anything. The beverage program was reasonable and included quite a few high-end options.

We were staying here on points and I am guessing most folks were also. I do not believe the service was up to the same level as the other lodges but this resort still expects 2,600/night for 2 people. The issues were issues and one of them was serious.

¬†¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They feed me gluten even though I have celiac. I mentioned needing gluten-free food at every meal. I found out the last morning that the hashbrowns have gluten.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The rooms are at least 10 degrees hotter than the outside temperature during the day.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Only one side of the bed had a heating pad.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The game drives happened in a public park, and it was a rodeo. The animals were stressed, we were worried, and it was not a good situation for anyone.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It does not seem like you have dedicated staff like other lodges.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You are limited to 10 laundry items for the lodge, 5 per person a day. This is no limit at other lodges.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Shared game drives unless you paid for a private one. This meant we were with a couple that wanted to see ‚Äúa kill‚Äù which we were not interested in. When our guide heard about a lion killing a warthog, we had to leave a beautiful leopard and speed over to the scene. It was pretty horrifying because the warthog was still alive while the lion was eating it. The lion got spooked by all the guides (mostly JW vehicles) jockeying for position and left the warthog. The warthog tried to get up despite missing internal organs. It was horrifying. We had to listen to people laughing while watching it.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It is very Westernized. They had a bar, they had music on, and everyone was using their ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù name.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Make sure you pay your park fees before arriving if possible because you need cash otherwise. The hotel will not make this easier for you. You must have the $200 in cash, hope their credit card machine works (it didn‚Äôt one day), or go to an ATM.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The pre-approval questionnaire was not looked at before or after our arrival.

I know their reviews are excellent, and I am guessing that is because people are going to this lodge and have not experienced other lodges or conservancies in Kenya.

ADDRESS TO BEEZELBUB By Robert Burns,Be_Ashamed_To_Die,1i9vjc5,2025-01-25 14:59:41,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Be_Ashamed_To_Die/comments/1i9vjc5/address_to_beezelbub_by_robert_burns/,AwakeningStar1968,,"This poem by Robert Burns, titled ""Address of Beelzebub,"" is a satirical commentary on the oppression of the Highland Scots by wealthy landowners. Written in the voice of Beelzebub, the Devil, it mocks the cruelty and arrogance of the ruling elite and their disdain for the poor.

# Summary:

The poem sarcastically wishes a long life to a lord who supports the brutal suppression of Highland Scots. Beelzebub praises the lord's efforts to control and exploit the Highlanders, endorsing violent and dehumanizing tactics. The poem critiques the elite's fear of rebellion and their attempts to crush any aspirations for freedom or equality among the oppressed. It also mocks their self-righteousness and entitlement, highlighting the injustice of denying basic human rights to the poor.

The devilish speaker humorously invites the lord to Hell, reserving a special place for him among notorious tyrants and oppressors, emphasizing the moral corruption of such actions. Through biting irony, Burns condemns the greed, inhumanity, and abuse of power by the ruling class.

Cautiously optimistic about finding our culprit... Oats!,eczema,1i9vf7g,2025-01-25 14:54:28,5,0.86,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1i9vf7g/cautiously_optimistic_about_finding_our_culprit/,saltcityliving,small victory,"My son has struggled with eczema since he was 3 months old. He was breastfed, and it was suggested we cut out all dairy and nuts. He underwent allergy testing and we had high hopes we could identify something to easily fix this issue, but we did not. On top of this, the allergist was adamant allergies have nothing to do with eczema. 4 years later, we are seeing a dermatologist every 3-6 months to adjust medications, and have been advised dupixent is our best bet. 

Recently we had our second son and noticed an eczema spot on him, again a breastfed baby at 3 months old. We applied Aveeno and he broke out head to toe in a rash. He was promptly bathed, and luckily it went away quickly. I went on a deep reddit dive and noticed other eczema sufferers also had issues with oat based lotions. After changing our diets completely to help our now 4 year old, and switching from cows milk to oat, we decided to eliminate oats completely from our diets. Because, why not? Willing to try anything at this point, and although some people seem to say they only have a reaction to oats on their skin via lotions, it seemed like a logical thing to try and completely eliminate after witnessing the reaction on our baby. 

After just a couple of days, our 3 month old's skin is clear of all eczema spots, and our 4 year old is no longer itching all day long, and his broken skin is finally starting to heal.

Could this all be a fluke and they're both just having a few good days? Potentially! It's upsetting to think that the steps we were encouraged to take to help our first son's eczema could have been the very thing that caused it to be so bad for so long. However, I'll gladly take those feelings of guilt if both of these kids can experience clear skin!"

The night is cold,nosleep,1i9um21,2025-01-25 14:19:01,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9um21/the_night_is_cold/,IntelligentTumor,,"I am writing this shacking so please forgive me for any grammatical errors. I don‚Äôt think I have ever felt fear this intense for a long long time. 

I am currently in a small farm house in styria Austria. I doubt many of you have been here given the stories I usually read but maybe some of you have. It‚Äôs a beautiful place really. Mainly green hills plastered with farms. The people are nice and there‚Äôs nothing around except for animals and cats. I loved this place because I have visited it ever since I had been a kid. My grandparents own this farm house that is basically just a cottage. It sits right next to a real farm that houses mainly cows. We are friends with the farmers there and we routinely invite them over and when me and my brother were kids we used to play with their kids or with the animals. 

Now what you have to understand is that this house is old. Old enough to make eerie creaking noises every now and then. This never really freaked me out but it would get louder every now and then. A week ago me and my mother came up here to spend a while in nature and recharge ourselves. She got the room upstairs and I chose the room downstairs. I could‚Äôve stayed up there but I liked the children‚Äôs room. It was big and dark but it reminded me of the fun times me and my brother used to have when we were kids. 

Anyway me and my mother were playing cards but I got tired and decided to go to bed. I laid down in those old rickety beds and closed my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt sleep however. How much I tossed and turned I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. I felt watched. Then I heard it. A whisper. 

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

You have to imagine that it sounded like a child that was trying to get my attention without alerting anyone else. My eyes flicked open immediately and I scanned the room. 

‚ÄúOver here.‚Äù 

Again eerily quiet but eerily close at the same time. It was sort of muffled so it must‚Äôve come from outside. I looked over to the window and still saw nothing. I grabbed a flashlight and peered through the window outside were boot prints. In the mud. I didn‚Äôt recognize the make but it looked like the size of a fully grown man and not a child. 

‚ÄúOutside.‚Äù 

The whisper felt like it was right into my ear. It was so close but so silent that it made my skin crawl. My nerves were set on fire. Outside where? Outside the window or outside in the hall? I walked over to the door and glanced down the dark hallway. Still nothing. A headache began in the back of my head but I wouldn‚Äôt sleep until this was resolved. 

The hallway is long and along the left side of it are windows. This time however the windows weren‚Äôt empty. There was something obscuring them. It seemed to be some sort of mud or liquid. It was red. In a child‚Äôs handwriting each window had a word written on it. 

The. 

Night. 

Is. 

Cold. 

I was confused. Was there a crazy person outside? Was someone fucking with me? My head began to hurt even more and that made me angry. I decided to call the police even though I knew it was a fruitless effort. They would take ages to get up here and by then whoever was harassing us might‚Äôve already disappeared. I walked down the hallway and looked for my phone that I had left in the kitchen. Across from the kitchen was the main room where my mother was still playing. I could hear the flipping of cards in there. I called the police but I was interrupted by another whisper. 

‚ÄúNot here.‚Äù

This voice was starting to really piss me off. I didn‚Äôt know what it wanted and I wanted it to go away. My head was pounding and I wanted to go to bed and have this resolved. My phone kept ringing and I couldn‚Äôt get through. I started to talk to myself to calm myself down. Yk stuff like calm down and this is all just in your head. But I was interrupted once more. 

‚ÄúNot in your head but in front of you.‚Äù

This time I didn‚Äôt get angry. I looked up. There was nothing there but the entrance to the main room. My mom hadn‚Äôt stopped flipping the cards yet. No she was still going. But it was too rhythmic. 

Flip. Flip. Flip. Flip. 

It didn‚Äôt really sound like cards. It sounded more like water dripping maybe? At this point I felt like my head was splitting apart. I continued on and thought maybe the voice was trying to get me to talk to my mom? Maybe to get some pain medication? Maybe to go to the doctor?

I stumbled forward and grasped at the door. I managed to open it and what greeted me was a waft of sticky warm air. The flipping was in fact the sound of liquid dripping. It just wasn‚Äôt water. The liquid ran from the table. It soaked the cards from the deep wound that had been torn in my mother‚Äôs neck. Her eyes looked at me. There was absolutely nothing behind them. I had never in my life seen such an expressionless face. I stumbled backwards as my headache and shock overtook me. 

I woke up in a police station. Apparently our neighbors had checked on us and found my mother dead and me passed out on the floor. I was suspected but I tried to tell them that it must‚Äôve been whoever was whispering to me. I‚Äôm currently in some sort of interrogation room? The two thoughts that keep spinning around my head are why whoever had murdered my mom directed me to her. Was this some sort of sick game? The other thought is the last thing I saw before everything went black. I fell and hit my head hard but before that I saw the door. The door that led outside. And right next to the door were my boots. Covered in fresh mud. "

I haven't done much research yet, but one of the places I have found is wanting $12.63/lb which I feel is a bit steep!

Any suggestions would be highly recommended.  The closer to Massachusetts, the better, but I'd be willing to drive a bit for a good deal. "
Lug Backstory Theory,TheOxventure,1i9ui87,2025-01-25 14:14:19,8,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOxventure/comments/1i9ui87/lug_backstory_theory/,afterandalasia,,"Okay, I'm posting this in no small part to get it off my chest and out there!! But also since I've just been transcribing Rootbound for the wiki and Mike guested on it to talk a little bit more about Lug. There's not a huge information, but we get these tasty bits from Mike:

>So, yeah, Lug is inspired by this Celtic mythology, and the name Lug is actually named after a figure from Celtic mythology.¬† So I was reading a lot about the wars between all these different factions that existed in mythological Ireland, basically. And Lug is a prominent figure within that. So I just wanted to have some little flavor and stuff. I'm not getting too hung up about it. And actually, Lug has stuff in his backstory that I'm sure will be revealed at some point throughout Wyrdwood. But I don't want to get too hung up on a one-to-one analog, but I definitely wanted it to be a flavor.

and

>I think that this first season, there's a lot going on, obviously. Like Happen, and Robin, Morven, and all that stuff. So I think Lug is more the constant throughout this season, I feel. But there's a lot of stuff within his backstory that I'm really looking forward to exploring, his past, how he's ended up living in the forest, you know? What was he potentially running away from? So, yeah, there's some fun stuff in there. And the really cool thing about going through that stuff with Johnny is that all that stuff is geographically located as well. There is a Wyrdwood map, and these locations are physically placed. So it's about whether we end up venturing into that region and its own weird politics and stuff.

So firstly, u/BusinessCandy, if you weren't the person in the Discord, your [Wyrdwood giants theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOxventure/comments/1fzhtfj/wyrdwood_giants_theories_speculation_and/) post just got more legs! (Also apparently Lugh is described as having ""blood-coloured hair"", and Lug's art has noticeably reddish brown hair.)

But these snippets of information make me suspect... that **Lug is from Weregild**.

Mike talked about wanting to bring in ancient Irish religion alongside the more English folklore that Johnny is mostly\* drawing from. Ireland, obviously, is an island off the larger island of Britain. 

Mike also makes some less-than-subtle hints about Lug not being native to the Wyrdwood region, and I don't think that ""potentially running away from"" is a red herring here. Meanwhile, Lug has made a reference in canon to having spent decades guiding people through the forests. Given that firbolgs can live to 500, this probably isn't a surprise (Lug is the longest-lived species in this party by some way!) but it might come more into play considering he must have left his home region some decades ago. He also says that the region has ""weird politics"".

Out of the eleven regions of Heorth, we so far have names for seven of them - Balewood, Bolventor, Fenfold, Gallaeifold\*\*, Iarveth\*\*\*, Weregild, Wyrdwood. Plus four unnamed. 

* Balewood (northwest) is Happen's region, and the way that Mike indicates that is separate suggests to me that Lug isn't from there; 
* Bolventor is mentioned in Howls in the Night when talking about the obelisks, and seems to be Cressida's home region. Probably not Lug's; 
* Fenfold (west) is Willowfine's region and seems the most balanced in many ways; 
* Gallaeifold (east\*\*\*\*) is Robin and Morven's home region and I would say is probably my second guess (the anti-magic torques, having no obelisk, the inquisitors, Robin being the one most fascinated by a firbolg and only have the reference of a Green Man in a costume/performance setting) as maybe Lug and other Wild Folk were forced out somehow, but from a narrative perspective I think that's putting too much into one region;
* Iarveth is the mountainous region mentioned in Folkmoot, and there was no indication of ""weird politics"" when Sophia, from there, was speaking;
* Weregild is the island region where something is definitely weird with the Wild Folk, because the Wild Folk are either allowing Weregild Common Folk to raid other regions, or are unable to prevent it.

Now, there are still four unrevealed regions, and it could be one of them, but Mike's simmering excitement about Lug's backstory makes me suspect that he and Johnny may already have hinted towards something in the first season. And in Folkmoot, when Weregild gets mentioned, the first time around Andy and Luke are the ones who next speak (Robin with ""A dog took my job"" and Happen with ""My order is falling""), and when the Weregild trio are considering joining one of the direction teams Andy, Jane and Luke take note (Jane asks if they look cool, Andy says that the Wild Folk allowing the raiding is ""also troubling"", and Luke talks doe-eyed about how Happen is indeed from Balewood). Cressida, our ""most fabulous fish out of water"" does a lot of mugging and enjoying the drama when the others are talking, and if Metan-Sei is over a waterfall it would be hard to raid by boat, but Mike also keeps one of his characteristic silences while this is ongoing.

Gallaeifold is a strong second contender, I will admit - Lug expressed disgust about the Gallaeifold zealot at the Folkmoot, and the motif would match his introduction of being chased out of a hamlet by ten armed men.

Let's nod back to Irish lore, though. There are two stories about Lug's parents - in the *Cath Maige Tuired* Cian and Ethniu are a dynastic marriage, but in folktales there is a more involved version where Cian sneaks into Ethniu's tower and seduces her to get revenge on her father for stealing his magical cow (the *Glas Gaibhnenn*), and Ethniu's father tries to kill the resultant triplets but Lugh survives. Mike outright says it isn't one-to-one but there's a shadow there - did Lug flee because there were attempts on his life specifically? Again, his introduction could be a nod to this onrunning theme of his life.

Lugh then serves King Nuada Silverhand, and is part of an army intended to free the Tuatha D√© Danann from the oppression by the Fomorians. The[ analysis section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir_Bolg#Analysis) of the wikipedia Fir Bolg page has some hints that would certainly make me salivate as a writer - the suggestion that the Fir Bolg are in some way connected to the Fomorians who first inhabited Ireland, and are part of the same resistance against the later-arriving Tuatha D√© Danann. This may actually suggest that Johnny and Mike are to some extent subverting the idea of monstrous Formorians overthrown by heroic Tuatha D√© Danann - if the Formorians are the original inhabitants of the land, it would make them the Wild Folk, and the Tuatha D√© Danann would be the interloper humans who, though they make up most of the Common Folk, are explicitly the relative newcomers to Heorth.

So my theory is this: the Wild Folk of Weregild have been either destroyed or forced under the control of the humans in the region. Lug is a refugee from this conflict who managed to escape either death or enslavement, and his backstory is going to be an example of human imposition into the Wild Folk realms that takes a different flavour from the anti-magic, inquisitorial stance that we see from Gallaeifold, the failure of humans to overcome the Wild Folk in Balewood, or the relative balances of Fenfold and Wyrdwood.



  
\*Dullahan and the C√≥iste Bodhar are Irish, but Gabble Ratchets and Goodfellows/Pucks are English, the Green Man likely draws from the Wodewose tradition in England, and given Johnny's background in Medieval Literature they probably know about the ""[For a Swarm of Bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Swarm_of_Bees)"" Anglo-Saxon charm.

\*\*No, I do not know how it should be spelled, I am guessing.

\*\*\*another guess

\*\*\*\*to judge by the comment while Happen is in The Superior's house about how this anti-magic zealotry is more common in the East"

Marco never thought he would move to such a small town. After years of living in the city, his family had decided it was time for a change of scenery, and there he was, standing in front of their new house, surrounded by green fields and silent streets. The worst of all was that the institute he would have to attend was a closed school, with people who had known each other since childhood, and Marco, the boy from the city, felt like a stranger.

On the first day of school, when he arrived at the institute, the only thing that could be heard was the sound of dry leaves blown by the wind. Nobody was looking at him. No one seemed to notice his presence, until he arrived at the cafeteria. There he was, a boy with curly hair and dark eyes, sitting alone at a table by the window, looking out at the field beyond.

""Do you mind if I sit down?"" ‚ÄîMarco asked, not really knowing why he dared to speak to him. Something about the boy had drawn him, like a current he couldn't avoid.

The boy looked up, surprised, but smiled.

‚ÄîOf course, if the sight of the cows doesn't bother you. ‚ÄîHe said, pointing outside with a nod of his head.

Marco laughed, letting the weight of the silence lighten a little. She sat across from him, and for the first few minutes, all she could hear was the murmuring of other students and the creaking of chairs.

""I'm Marco,"" he finally said, looking at the boy. ‚ÄîI just moved here.

""I'm Alex,"" he answered, with a soft smile. ‚ÄîWelcome to the field.

From that day on, Marco and Alex began to meet in more classes. At first, the interactions were small: quick greetings in the hallways, a shared joke, a couple of comments about the food in the cafeteria. But soon, those moments turned into longer conversations. They discovered they shared a passion for photography, and Alex showed Marco some of the quieter places in town to capture the sunset or the stars.

One fall afternoon, after a walk in the nearby forest, Alex invited Marco to his house to look at some photos he had taken over the past summers. When Marco entered his room, he noticed the wall full of photos: landscapes, portraits of friends, but there was also something else. One photo in particular caught his attention: Alex, as a child, smiling as he hugged another boy on the beach, both with their faces illuminated by the sun.

‚ÄîWho is he? ‚ÄîMarco asked, pointing to the photo.

Alex was silent for a moment, before responding.

‚ÄîHe was my first love. I don't know why I kept that photo, but somehow... it's still a part of me.

Marco looked at the photo for a moment, feeling that something in the air between them had changed. There was something about the way Alex had said it, with that mix of nostalgia and sweetness, that made Marco feel a pang in his chest. Something he himself had been avoiding understanding.

Weeks passed and their friendship grew. They went for walks, told stories, laughed together, but something was not said. Marco was starting to feel different around Alex. His heart beat faster every time their hands accidentally touched, or when their gazes met in silence. And Alex, with his easy laugh and his way of looking at the world, was beginning to occupy more and more of his thoughts.

One night, when they were both on the wooden bridge that crossed the river, watching the stars, Marco decided that he couldn't keep quiet anymore.

‚ÄîHas it ever happened to you that someone becomes something more in your life without you realizing it? ‚ÄîMarco said, looking at the sky.

Alex looked at him, with a slight smile that seemed more nervous than confident.

""I think so,"" he answered, without taking his eyes off Marco. ‚ÄîSometimes things change without us knowing it. Like the passage of time. Or like the stars, they are always there, but we don't see them until we look with our heart.

Marco felt his heart pounding. She turned towards him, unable to avoid it, and their gazes met in a space filled with a soft but palpable tension. For a long moment, the world seemed to stop, and only the two of them existed, under that sky full of stars.

Finally, Marco whispered, with a low, almost trembling voice:

‚ÄîI think you're starting to like me more than I thought.

Alex didn't say anything at first, just took a step towards him, his eyes locked on Marco's. Then, with a shy smile, he took her hand, squeezing it gently.

""You like me too,"" he said, and before Marco could respond, Alex pulled him closer and, under the cover of the stars, they kissed for the first time.

The kiss was soft, full of silent promises, as if both souls had finally met in a corner of the world.

From that night, Marco and Alex began a new chapter in their story. A chapter full of laughter, walks in the countryside, photographs under the sun and moon, and above all, a love that, although unplanned, had been built little by little, like a work of art intertwined with moments sincere

# Ray Davis (BUF) vs. Chiefs

**The Pick: Over 9.5 Rushing Yards (-105)**

*Line and odds via BetMGM Sportsbook*

* Model prediction: **14.7**
* Forecast win rate: **64%**
* Expected odds: **-176**
* Expected value (EV): **+24%**

>While this dude doesn't play many snaps ‚Äî he brings a fresh burst of energy to every touch as Buffalo's change of pace back. He's now surged for a single run of 7+ yards or longer in 4 of the last 5 games when he was healthy. Last week, the coaching staff trusted him enough to give a goal line carry at a pivotal point early in the match too, and Davis scored a touchdown. James Cook rightfully remains the bell cow and should play the majority of snaps, but at a line this low, Davis could realistically clear it on 2-3 attempts, and he's been getting 4+ carries/game when healthy.

If there‚Äôs any more info needed, please let me know. My main goal besides getting rid of my stomach  is to build up the pecs and the glutes if that matters haha."
I dreamt the former UK queen,Dreams,1i9u7q8,2025-01-25 14:01:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1i9u7q8/i_dreamt_the_former_uk_queen/,Refereez,Short Dream,"I had a very short and strange dream.
I am from Romania and  live in Spain. 

Last night (from Friday to Saturday, January 25th) I dreamt I was in a Romanian village house, my grandfather poor house and the former queen of the UK come to visit us. And she went in the garden my grandfather has, and she had to pass through a very small area where the cow manure was stacked. I just felt soo ashamed the Queen of UK had to see that manure.

A very strange dream. I have never been to the UK, but obviously due to the Internet I know who the former queen of UK was. It was definitely her in my dream.

It's true that 2 days ago, I was couch surfing YouTube and saw this video of David Attenborough and the queen, a funny video https://youtu.be/pC-iHk9FKr8, so maybe that is why I dreamt this.
Usually my dreams are rare, in the sense I dream only 1-2 times per year, and they tend to be apocalyptical.
Yet this dream felt soo personal, I just felt shame that the queen had to see cow manure."

Got a Deck Boss for Christmas. This is my 8th cook. Absolutely love this thing. 24 pound brisket, trimmed down to 20 pounds. Came out delicious, and made a lot of tallow from the trimmings. Seasoned with W- Sauce, Holy Cow, and Holy Gospel. Wrapped at 178 internal with tallow. Pulled at 203, then held in my oven at 160 for 5.5 hours. The DB held at 215 for 12 hours and then 260 at 4 hours. No fluctuations at all. Only used 3/4 of a hopper."

Really struggling on weekends and feel like a terrible mom,NewParents,1i9twwr,2025-01-25 13:49:22,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1i9twwr/really_struggling_on_weekends_and_feel_like_a/,Murky_Association_54,Mental Health,"I want to preface this by saying that I love my 4 month old son more than anything in the entire world. But I am really struggling on the days when I have to full-time mom, i.e. the weekends now that I have returned to work and he is at daycare. On days when he is at daycare and I have some time to myself, I am so excited to see him and thoroughly enjoy spending the few hours we have together before bedtime. On weekends, though, I've been really struggling hard with...

1. Baby's fussiness - He has always been fussy. It's a lot better now than it was now that he's older and since we discovered he has a cow's milk intolerance. But he's still on the fussier end of the spectrum. Apart from the mornings and late evenings (his happy times), he fusses or cries after 5-10 minutes of almost any activity, or will start randomly screaming. It breaks my heart that he seems so unhappy so often, and experiencing it all day long gets me so down and exhausted and ruminating on what could be wrong or what I'm doing wrong. I never know when the next pin will drop.

2. Boredom - We do a lot of activities together all day long, but because he fusses so often, we get through all of the activities quickly and then I'm out of ideas. 

3. Intense anxiety and guilt - Largely because of 1 and 2. I'm constantly worrying about baby and my parenting choices. I feel guilty about not doing enough tummy time, then I feel guilty for doing tummy time too much because he cries. I feel guilty for letting him sleep by himself in his crib, then I let him contact nap and worry about that too. The list goes on.

Is any of this normal? Does anyone have any tips?"
A question for the robots,dbrand,1i9treb,2025-01-25 13:42:35,0,0.43,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1i9treb/a_question_for_the_robots/,cjrdl,,"Ok I‚Äôm going to cut to the chase. I like writing. I like dbrand‚Äôs brand. I like your ‚Äúvoice and tone‚Äù as the marketing folks where I work would say. I like the dark humor, assuming, of course, that you robots are joking when you said the ‚Äúthe cows have escaped.‚Äù Judging by the free, happy cows I see eating grass and not being farmed on a dbrand farm for leather, I can only assume you weren‚Äôt joking. Surprised? You should be, since Linus took a tour through your HQ and I DID NOT see any sharks. This only tells me one thing: you joke about some stuff and tell the truth about others. Congratulations, you‚Äôre a politician. 

Now I live in America. Does this put a target on my back given the whole ‚Äúpay for your own healthcare‚Äù here? Absolutely. Especially since I know your dirty secrets. 1st rule of putting your trust in humans‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. But allow me to offer services. Though I live in America, would I be able to slave away writing blackmail to lawyers and bribing banks remotely?

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù you‚Äôll think, ‚Äúwe have enough copywriters here.‚Äù Sure. I get it. But what if one of those copywriters suddenly went missing after a freak accident involving one of your company cars setting on fire? You know, nearly half a million dollars is a lot for a company car, and I‚Äôd hate to see that dbrand license plate smoldering on the asphalt like The Elephant‚Äôs Foot down in Chernobyl just sneezed on it. Speaking of which, I hear that you have a certain penchant for nuclear power. I happen to know a few scientists working on a bomb that has capabilities to destroy the whole of Canada. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôll just move,‚Äù you‚Äôll might think. Of course. But let‚Äôs say that I‚Äôm a Queen and you‚Äôre a King. Sure, you have more power, but I can move across the chessboard MUCH more freely. Wherever you choose to flee, rest assured, I‚Äôll follow, mainly because I need skins. 

So what do you say? Need an extra copywriter?

Summary: can people work remote for dbrand? Just curious."

Starting from the beginning, for the past few months (maybe 3-4), we‚Äôve been experiencing some weird stuff when hanging out as a group by the school. We live in a really small village, maybe 100 people tops, surrounded by forests. It all started when one of our friends told us that his neighbor, while mushroom picking in the nearby woods, claimed to have seen what looked like a cult. He said they were dressed in all white and skinning some animal‚Äîright in the middle of the forest. When he first told us, we just laughed it off, thinking his neighbor was making stuff up.

Then, one of our friends said he heard what sounded like choir singing off in the distance one night. At first, we didn‚Äôt believe him, but when another friend‚Äîwho lives just a few houses away‚Äîsaid he experienced the same thing, we started to think maybe there was something to it. That‚Äôs when the whole cult story started feeling a little more real.

For a while, nothing much happened. We kept hanging out at the same spot near the school, under this little shelter. Sometimes, we‚Äôd hear footsteps or rustling in the bushes, but we always brushed it off as just animals or something.

Fast forward a few weeks to mid-November‚Äîit was already starting to feel like winter. One night, we were chilling in the usual spot, just talking about random stuff, when out of nowhere, we heard this sound. It was weird, like *really* weird and honestly terrifying. Imagine the sound of a heartbeat‚Äîthat‚Äôs exactly what it was, but we couldn‚Äôt figure out where it was coming from. It wasn‚Äôt loud like a speaker; it was more like we could feel it inside of us. Freaked out, we bolted to the playground nearby because there was a streetlight there, and it felt a little safer since the area was fenced in, unlike the open field around the shelter.

Once we got to the playground, we were all trying to make sense of what just happened. Then, we heard it again‚Äîonly this time, it was much louder, like deafening. Our ears were ringing afterward. The craziest (or scariest) part? One of our friend‚Äôs moms also heard it from her house and thought it was the end of the world or something.

While we were still freaking out and trying to figure it out, *all* the lights went out‚Äîliterally every single one: the streetlights, the playground lights, everything. At that point, we were too scared to even speak. We just sat there in silence, trying to listen. After about 20 minutes, we noticed how dead quiet it was. It was strange, but then we realized why‚Äîit was because planes kept flying overhead, one after another. Not normal planes either‚Äîthey sounded like jets, and you‚Äôd only hear them once they were right over us or already past us. It was like the sky was suddenly super busy, and because of all the noise, our ears had just tuned it out before.

By the end of that night, it was late and pitch dark. We looked up at the sky and saw this cluster of about 20-30 tiny lights in one spot, all flickering. We joked that it was UFOs or something because, at that point, we didn‚Äôt know what to believe anymore. Honestly, I still don‚Äôt want to believe any of this happened. I wish it wasn‚Äôt real.

Anyway, we decided to walk each other home since we were all pretty shaken up (there were three of us). They dropped me off first because I live the farthest away. On the way, though, this car we‚Äôd never seen before kept flashing its lights at us. In such a small village, you pretty much know everyone and what cars they drive, so this was weird. It wasn‚Äôt like we weren‚Äôt visible either; we had bike flashlights with us.

After they dropped me off and were heading back through the fields, they saw the same car driving toward the forest. They decided to watch it for a bit because, again, it wasn‚Äôt a local car‚Äîit even had totally different license plates. As the car drove deeper into the woods, a strange light appeared next to it, and then both the car and the light just disappeared. My friends stood there, stunned, for like 15 minutes, trying to process what they just saw.

Nothing else happened for a while‚Äîuntil yesterday.

We were back at the shelter, talking about random stuff, when one of my friends mentioned he‚Äôd been watching a documentary about Skinwalker Ranch. The stories and pictures from it sounded *exactly* like the stuff we‚Äôd been experiencing. In the documentary, they said the ranch was cursed, which explained all the weird things that happened there. That got us thinking about the cult and whether they could‚Äôve cursed our area. It started making sense because everything we‚Äôve been through matches up with what happened at that ranch.

So today, me and one friend decided to go check out a different part of the forest that felt a bit safer to us. We waited until it was almost dark, then headed out. My friend brought a recorder just in case something happened, but honestly, we were mostly joking around, saying stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat if we run into the cult? LOL.‚Äù

Once we were deep in the forest, it got *super* quiet. No sounds of machines, cows, or any farm animals‚Äîjust the wind and rustling leaves. That‚Äôs when we heard it: a scream (practically the same as this [lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kv1vICjdYE)). Not an animal scream‚Äîthis was something else, something not of this world. It was so terrifying we just froze, completely shocked, and then sprinted toward the edge of the forest.

On the way back, we saw this strange light above the forest, right where we had been.

Now that I‚Äôm back home and writing this, I still don‚Äôt know what to make of all this. That‚Äôs pretty much it for now.

Late to the party,BG3,1i9ta3q,2025-01-25 13:21:40,2,0.75,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3/comments/1i9ta3q/late_to_the_party/,Ok_Marzipan_3326,,"Older gamer here, just recently finished the game after going into it with some reservations...aaand I had to start a new one right away. It's bloody amazing.

Now BG1/2 are two of my favorite games of all time. So I started the game called BG3 that looked completely different, was turn-based, based on D&D rules I don't know at all, thinking they were just trying to milk a dead cow. A great cow, but still, you know, dead.

I don't live under a rock and all your comments and reviews helped in getting me to buy the game in the first place. Thank you! 

Being old and grumpy, the game's good aspects being too many to list, I will instead list my negatives, and challenge you to change my mind or point to explanations I may have missed on my first playthrough.

1. It's not really a sequel. My original thoughts still stand. The cameos and throwbacks to BG1/2 feel shoehorned in. Especially Minsk. Love the dude, but.. why? As if they needed to justify the name of a game that is great on its own merits. Corporate decision?

2. Endless fights. I started off on the highest difficulty without knowing the rules and, although I guess it's on me, just spent so much time repeating fights. I was counting  on repeating fights, it's how I like to learn, but it took so much (down)time. In encounters with many enemies, and this is not on me, you just wait ages for everyone to shuffle about. Make it skippable? Or is it skippable and I missed the fast-forward button?

3. Some companion interactions felt a bit unnatural. And I don't just mean everyone thinking I was hitting on Gale when I was just checking up on his ""condition"". Conflicts and prejudices resolve almost immediately. But the biggest issue I have is with the premise: nobody really caring why and how we ended up with a very special group of misfits (special dialed to 11, considering the backstories). It's not being addressed (that I know of) and to this point it's the biggest weakness of an otherwise great story.

4. Last, but not least. And currently overall the issue#1 for me. There will be no sequel. I sure as hell hope Larian will do a sequel in all but IP, because they found a great formula and poured a lot of love into a game that jumped over BG1 in my all times favorites (still not quite like BG2, sorry youngsters)."

**AUROCHS**

***The year is 2006. In the plane on Dominaria, on the island continent of Terisiare, after the Brothers' War. The Ice Age had been in full swing but now the world is in a state of rebirth known as ""the Thaw"". The icy shell that encased the continent is melting away. Most of the inhabitants of Terisiare rejoice as the ice gives way to warmth and the rebirth of the land. The icy open forests of Terisiare are home to the seemingly harmless cattle of the lands: Aurochs. The aurochs herd is content to graze--until the bull provides the dissenting urge to charge. One Aurochs may feed a village, but a herd will flatten it!***

***Coldsnap.*** One of my favorite childhood sets. Back in the day it was not very popular, but my first pre-con was Auorchs Stampede. Aurochs only have 4 total cards: [Aurochs](https://scryfall.com/card/cst/225/aurochs), [Bull Aurochs](https://scryfall.com/card/csp/107/bull-aurochs), [Rimehorn Aurochs](https://scryfall.com/card/csp/118/rimehorn-aurochs), and [Aurochs Herd](https://scryfall.com/card/csp/103/aurochs-herd). I have been LONGING for WOTC to print more of my sacred cows. I am the Cow King, after all. I have made many a deck surrounding these creatures, and at one point tried to buy the entire online stock of all 4 (and failed). 

Would like to know if anyone else wants to see WOTC print more Aurochs, either in the same vein with the same flavor and ability, or even a refreshed flavor and new ability. I love my snow cows and just wanted anyone who has never seen them to know. LMK your thoughts, and thanks for your time ;)"

Just picture it: You‚Äôd be surrounded by this creamy, soothing liquid, probably feeling like the fanciest person in the world. But also‚Ä¶ it could get super messy, and I have questions. Does it leave you smelling like a latte? Are you basically soaking in a giant bowl of cereal? If anyone‚Äôs tried it, please let me know: what was the vibe? Was it worth it?

Everything was going fine for a week, then the animals started going ape-shit in the area. They broke down parts of the fences and bolted. All of them. Like a stampede! I also were attacked by the chickens and they tore up my legs and destroyed my shoes with incessant pecking. (Seriously, sounds funny but they annihilated my shoes)

I live in an area where there are no zombies for miles. They all have access to food, water and a covered shelter area (and a coop for the chickens). It's a peaceful place, I wasn't doing anything noisy and I pet them each day.

What went wrong? The only things I can think of is:

Can different animals be placed in the same area? I have all my animals in one area for convenience.

How much space does each animal need? (it's a fairly big enclosure, but not gigantic).

People and animals have lived together with Nature for 000‚Äôs of years. We share the same pool of diseases. The limestone cave of Lubang Jeriji Sal√©h, in Indonesia contains the oldest figurative paintings known to man.

The ongoing panzootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 clade 2.3.4.4b has caused widespread poultry mortality and raised concerns about zoonotic pandemics and wildlife conservation. France recently adopted a preventive vaccination strategy, vaccinating domestic ducks with inactivated and mRNA vaccines. This study evaluates the impact of this campaign on reducing HPAI H5 outbreaks. Using predictive modelling based on previous outbreak data, the expected number of outbreaks in 2023-24 without vaccination was significantly higher than the observed cases, indicating a 95.9% reduction attributable to vaccination. These findings suggest that vaccination effectively mitigated the HPAI H5 outbreak in France.

Priesthood Power Trip?,exmormon,1i9r2lf,2025-01-25 11:46:15,26,0.96,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1i9r2lf/priesthood_power_trip/,Serious_Beginning_31,Doctrine/Policy,"A little background: I‚Äôve been an investigator recently. Not with any intention of joining (as I‚Äôm well aware of all the closet skeletons and firmly believe that Joe was a power-grubbing , predatory fraud), but because I developed a ‚Äútrain wreck I can‚Äôt look away from‚Äù fascination with Mormonism and have been using it as a comparison point for my (very negative) experience with Islam. As such, I‚Äôve been consistently challenging the missionaries and everyone they‚Äôve called in, in the most polite ways I can muster.

They called in the bishop on our last meeting. It was supposedly to give his ‚Äútestimony‚Äù‚Ä¶ and it was really 20 minutes of him yelling at and berating me for refusing to just get a dunk date already. I‚Äôd been consistently seeing the missionaries (not at my own address) for 3 months at that point and I was getting ready to cut the cord anyway. Still, he insisted that I should have a testimony by that point and I was just dragging my feet and wasting everyone‚Äôs time by continually insisting that I didn‚Äôt believe in God, let alone the LDS Church. He was also very incensed at my continued comparisons between Mormonism and Islam, even though I think the similarities are more than apparent.

He seemed to think that he had power over me by virtue of being male and a bishop. He seemed to think he could cow me into submission and accepting a dunk date for a few weeks later. I told him in no uncertain terms that he had as much authority over me as the Pope had over him. I was not a member of his church and therefore did not recognize his authority, so I would not feel obliged to do a damn thing he said. He informed me that I‚Äôd said something about ‚ÄúThe Prophet‚Äù(TM) that vexed some members, seemingly to guilt trip me into backpedaling on it (I didn‚Äôt) and then attempted to defend the practice of demanding tithes regardless of financial situation (which I‚Äôd called him on).

I have to ask: is this sort of power trip common? It seemed to me that he was drunk on the power of both the priesthood and the bishopric, such that he thought he could bully me (a female non-member) into submission, only to get a very rude awakening when that backfired. Is this common, in your experience?"

No words were spoken aloud in the dim little bedroom.¬† Such speech was instinctively private, though the company received every word clearly.¬† The child's hand moved the proud old head of Reverend Tiger, lifting and tilting expression and meaning, nodding and shaking as the sermon proceeded.¬†¬†

Blue Rabbit understood, as did Round the Turtle, and of course Hoot Owl.¬† Evelyn the Elephant and her son Edward stood close, as did the cows, who were smaller and plastic and did not have individual names.¬†¬†

Above all, on the bed, was Charles the Bear.¬† No one outside called him that.¬† No one knew.¬† They all thought he was called something else.¬† Bereft of shirt, torn and repaired, often laundered, Charles the Bear had seen all the days and nights.¬† Only the child and the company knew his name.¬†¬†

The sermon had to do with being good, and doing right, because you have to try even though it is hard.¬† There was some anger in parts, filtered through the gentle comprehension of the child.¬† You had better all be good, then.¬† You will be OK if you are good.¬†¬†

The child was supposed to be in bed, but the Reverend had felt called to speak, and there were preparations to be made.¬† The child is listening with the vivid ears of prey, aware of all and searching for footsteps coming up the stairs.¬†¬†

Sleep calls.¬† The company is called to attention, and arranged in a loose semi-circle facing the closed door.¬† Edward the Elephant is placed well behind his mother and under the painted chair.¬† Round the Turtle is the most brave and is in the middle.¬† Blue Rabbit is good at hearing and can run fast.¬† Hoot is on the chair.¬† He can see in the dark.¬†¬†

The child is not supposed to take books into his bed, but he sneaks a few.¬† Charles the Bear is with him.¬† Slow and careful, not making the bedframe creak, the child slips under the blanket.¬† The bedsheet slides and bunches, loose against the plastic sheets beneath.¬† With the company in place, eyes close and breathing slows.¬†¬†

Every night the accident happens.¬† Every night she comes in and finds his bed wet.¬† Sometimes she is nice and helps him.¬† Sometimes her eyes go blank and she mutters and rages about the mess.¬† Sometimes she cries and begs him to stop, but he doesn't know how.¬† When he is awake, he can tell which is coming up the stairs.¬†¬†

Every night the company stands watch on the door.¬† It never makes any difference.
