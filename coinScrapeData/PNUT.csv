Trading memecoins: A complete guide,Kraken,1i8zpx9,2025-01-24 11:43:03,1,0.52,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kraken/comments/1i8zpx9/trading_memecoins_a_complete_guide/,krakenexchange,Learn :Kraken_logo:,"# Key takeaways

1. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that pay tribute to memes, celebrities, animals and viral internet trends.
2. Successful memecoin trading requires thorough research to avoid scams, careful evaluation of community strength and liquidity factors, and adherence to best practices for risk management.
3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins 💻

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke. 

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars’ worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they’re highly volatile — even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them. 

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins 📍

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge), [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe) do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/) and [Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

[Download Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet)

# How to trade memecoins on centralized crypto exchanges 📝

As touched on above, Kraken boasts a wide selection of popular memecoins, which can be traded just as easily as any other asset. You can perform direct cash-to-crypto swaps in a few clicks, or set up more advanced orders (such as [recurring buys](https://www.kraken.com/learn/finance/dollar-cost-averaging) or [limit orders](https://www.kraken.com/learn/trading/trade-orders)) with ease.

At the time of this writing, Kraken supports [20+ popular memecoins](https://www.kraken.com/categories/meme), including:

* [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogecoin)
* [Shiba Inu (SHIB)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/shiba-inu)
* [Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pepe)
* [Bonk (BONK)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/bonk)
* [Dogwifhat (WIF)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dogwifhat)

# Key considerations for memecoin trading 🧐

As with any investment, [doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor) is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that **memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers — taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it’s easy for bad actors to ‘astroturf’ on social media — making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you’ll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength. 

An example of a potential red flag is an [LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens) that hasn’t been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide, [How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like [Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/) or [Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/) can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:** a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:** take a look at the project’s Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:** as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn’t, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:** can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading 📚

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders. 

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable. 

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading 📖

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that **the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space — ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

I’ve always loved birds, but have finally moved into a place where I can actually have feeders.

I have seen great blue herons, Sandhill cranes, egrets, snowy owls, and numerous hawks. But now my mission is woodpeckers and jays, etc.

I have suet feeders and so far have downy, hairy, red bellied, and some kind of sapsucker. Also juncos and tits.

No one comes to my black oil seed feeder, and only had blue jays once as I toss out unshelled peanuts for our squirrels.

What is up with the black oil feeder? It’s a squirrel buster. And also, my dream: how do I attract the pileated woodpecker?

Thank you so much!"
How it all started with Nutmeg,squirrels,1i8ylev,2025-01-24 10:55:49,64,0.99,2,https://v.redd.it/e4m2rn2tryee1,bald_and_beard,Original Content,"Back in early November, was out feeding the birds. Bluejays love peanuts, so I had some and noticed one of the squirrels close by. Took a chance to see if she would be interested. You can tell by my face at the end I was quite giddy, lol.

Originally thought it was a boy, so we were calling him Rocky, but did more research on squirrels in general, found out she was a girl, and had to change what we were calling her. Have since moved on from giving her peanuts and only the more healthy options like almonds, pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts.

Got a fancy squirrel box, put it up in a tree about 6 weeks ago, and she, nor any of the other squirrels, have taken to it. Nutmeg was spending a lot of time on our roof and on our back porch pergola, even ended up building a nest under our solar panels. Not a great choice, so took a chance of getting a squirrel box off of Amazon to put up on our back porch pergola.  Bought some natural bedding as well and she took too it within a week, days only at first, now she's in there all the time.  Also gave her more bedding that she has adjusted around to her liking during the cold.

I have a newer fancy squirrel box that can take a camera for inside viewing that I'll put together soon, but not sure when I'll put that up. It's been super cold here and don't want to replace the one she is using now in case she doesn't like the new one and have her go back to sleeping under a solar panel.

A few people have asked about a backstory, so there you have it, lol."

But it’s a great time to go walk in nature and appreciate the calm of the snowy landscape. Also giving your animal friends a hand by giving them food rich in fat and vitamins will help them get through the season where food is scarce. In the coldest times, my mother and I spread peanut butter on branches for the birds and squirrels, make sure it’s safe for them to eat beforehand."

Transitioning from a Bitcoin maximalist to a leading voice in the memecoin arena, Murad became the most trusted person in the memecoin space.

Recently, the HEGE community received huge news: Murad Mahmudov is aware of HEGE and has added it to his watchlist. (!!!!)

Murad's investment philosophy centers on identifying memecoins with dedicated/cultish communities. He emphasizes the importance of ""critical mass adoption,"" where a community is poised to go viral, leading to exponential growth. In an interview with LBank, he stated, ""The most critical concept is 'critical mass adoption'—where a community that has become a cult is ready to go viral.""  HEGE's passionate and expanding community aligns perfectly with this criterion, making it a prime candidate for Murad's investment consider Aktions. (Hege is everywhere at this point, you cant not see it, everybody knows about us.)

Moreover, Murad's focus on mid-cap memecoins with strong community backing further positions HEGE favorably. He believes that the best risk-reward ratio lies in ""mid-cap cults, very strong communities that continue to grow week to week.""  With HEGE's consistent growth and community engagement, it stands out as a potential gem in the memecoin landscape.

The confirmation that Murad has HEGE on his watchlist is more than just a morale boost; it's a strategic advantage. Murad's track record shows that his endorsements can significantly influence market dynamics. For instance, his substantial holdings in SPX6900 (SPX) turned a $387,000 investment into $23.6 million in just four months.  Such outcomes underscore the potential impact of Murad's attention on a memecoin's growth.

As HEGE continues to develop and strengthen its community, the likelihood of Murad publicly commenting on it increases. Such an endorsement could serve as a powerful catalyst, propelling HEGE toward the coveted $1 billion market cap. In the memecoin ecosystem, where community strength and influential backing are paramount, HEGE is strategically positioned for remarkable growth.

Every day, countless projects are launched, making it increasingly challenging for investors to identify those with strong potential. While some experienced users rely on specialized platforms and their expertise to spot promising projects, this approach requires significant effort, time, and expertise, and still carries a notable margin of error

Bitget has launched a new product called **Bitget SEED**, which could become one of the best tools for anyone (whether beginners or experts) looking to take advantage of new tokens right from their debut. Here’s why I personally believe this project is worth your attention.

# What is Bitget SEED?

Bitget SEED is an innovative platform developed by Bitget to help users identify and invest in high-potential Web3 projects early on. Instead of spending hours analyzing hundreds of projects to find the hidden gems, Bitget SEED offers a curated selection of carefully chosen projects presented daily.

# Why Use Bitget SEED?

Bitget SEED employs an automated and intelligent system to detect high-potential tokens as soon as they launch. Each day, up to five new tokens are added to the platform and evaluated against several rigorous criteria.

# Bitget Score: A Reliable Analysis Tool

The Bitget Score is an AI-powered rating system that analyzes and selects projects based on multiple parameters, including:

* **Trading activity**: Volume of trades and number of active traders.
* **Token distribution**: Balance and structure of tokenomics.
* **Growth potential**: Based on turnover rates and project development.
* **Liquidity**: Size and reliability of liquidity pools.
* **Contract security**: In-depth verification to mitigate risks such as rug pulls.

# Gas-Free Transactions and Simplified Trading

One of the major innovations of Bitget SEED is the absence of gas fees. You can buy and sell tokens directly with USDT without needing specific tokens like SOL to cover transaction fees. If needed, the system automatically handles conversions, ensuring a smooth and accessible experience, even for beginners.

# A Word of Caution: No Investment is Risk-Free

While I personally believe that Bitget SEED is a fantastic and indispensable tool for those drawn to new projects, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate both positively and negatively. Investing is not an exact science. Make sure to conduct thorough research before investing in any project, no matter how reliable it may seem.

Bitget SEED offers an exciting way to stay ahead in the Web3 space—use it wisely! 🚀

I've also seen clips of people putting the food in containers and puzzles the crows can open, so I'm considering maybe trying this so the starlings can't get to it, but with how timid they are I'm unsure they'll even try it.

Attracting cardinals to your backyard is a delightful experience, bringing a splash of vibrant red against the green of your landscape. These splendid birds are a joy to observe, but choosing the right cardinal bird feeder is crucial for their comfort and your viewing pleasure. This guide delves into the best cardinal bird feeders of 2025, exploring different types, features, and considerations to help you select the perfect one for your needs.

## Understanding Cardinal Needs: Why the Right Feeder Matters

Cardinals are not just any birds; they have specific preferences when it comes to feeding. Unlike some birds that can easily perch on small ledges or grip thin wires, cardinals have strong feet and prefer a more stable, flat surface.This is why understanding their unique needs is paramount when shopping for the right cardinal bird feeder. A  **cardinal-specific feeder design** will often include larger perches, trays, or platforms allowing cardinals to comfortably find food. Forcing them to use feeders designed for smaller birds might be unattractive or even cause them discomfort preventing them from visiting regularly. Thus, understanding what creates a ""happy place"" for them enhances your chances of watching them feed in your yard regularly.

## Types of Cardinal Bird Feeders: A Complete Overview

There's no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to **best cardinal bird feeders**. The most suitable type will often depend on your specific situation and the bird's preference. Here are some popular options:

* **Platform Feeders:** These are arguably one of the most favored designs for cardinals as they provide an ample, flat space to land and feed. **Platform feeder for cardinals** is usually large enough to accommodate multiple birds at a time. The open structure also makes it easier to monitor the level of food and prevents overcrowding. These feeders can be mounted on poles or hung from trees providing flexibility in placement. Often, a **cardinal feeder with tray** is a variation on this basic design. The tray catches spilled seeds,preventing mess and allowing even more birds to access the food source.

* **Tube Feeders:** Although not the traditional design for cardinals, there are **tube feeder for cardinals** designed with wider perches that allow cardinals to grip securely. Usually equipped with multiple ports and usually perches at different heights, they allow several birds to feed together. While some classic designs are geared toward smaller birds one can still find variations that work for the larger cardinals . Furthermore, these feeders can be easily filled and are more challenging for squirrels to access wich is ideal for backyards where squirrels are a challenge.

* **Hanging cardinal Feeders:** The concept of a **hanging cardinal feeder** is broad and can encompass different designs such as platform or tube feeders designed to hang from a branch or hook. These feeders eliminate the need for poles creating flexibility in placement. They are also easily moved when necessary. The right hanging feeder shoudl be sturdy and stable not swinging wildly in the breeze which might scare the larger cardinals.

## Key features to Consider When Selecting a Cardinal Bird Feeder

Before finalizing your purchase, it’s essential to consider the following features:

* **Durability:** Look for a **durable cardinal bird feeder** that can withstand the elements and last for multiple seasons. A **metal cardinal feeder** is a great option for durability while a **plastic cardinal feeder** can be a more economical and lightweight alternative, but choose quality plastics that won't crack or fade easily. The plastic option requires more care when being cleaned.

* **Size:** Consider the bird population you anticipate attracting and select either a **large cardinal feeder** or a **small cardinal feeder** accordingly. A larger feeder reduces the frequency of refills whereas smaller ones are ideal for smaller numbers of birds.

* **Squirrel Resistance:** Squirrels are a constant challenge. A **squirrel proof cardinal feeder** can include features such as cages, weight-activated perches, or baffles to deter them. This way the birds get the feed you intended for them rather than other backyard critters.

* **Ease of Cleaning:** A bird feeder that’s easy to clean will help to maintain a healthy environment for your birds. Look for a **easy to clean cardinal feeder** with removable parts or a design that allows for thorough scrubbing.Cleanliness is crucial to prevent disease transmission among the bird population flocking to your yard.

* **Weather Resistance:** A **weather resistant cardinal feeder** ensures the food stays dry and usable in rain or snow. This is vital as wet and clumped seed can cause mold and mildew growth that can be harmful to birds.

Toxic Rats: Axel, Noah, Shawn

Episode 9: Grand Chef Auto

""Last time, on Total Drama Revenge of the Island! Our players went on a hunt for buried treasure, aka, Gwen and Dakota.""

""Lindsay declared that she'd win for Mike with Emma trying to maintain her friendship with her and Alejandro plotting to throw them off.""

""After learning from Tyler that he wouldn't betray Noah, Axel worked with Shawn to ensure that a tiebreaker would happen.""

""Despite his best efforts, it was Tyler who got the boot, but he got to go home with a glow in the dark girlfriend by his side. Adios Klutztista!""

""Who will be the next Hurl? And how will we injure them beforehand? Find out the answers to these questions and more, right now, right here, on Total! Drama! Revenge, of the Island!""

(Theme Song)

The episode opened to a small pink bird singing happily on a tree branch...until a thick purple tentacle rose up and flicked it away. An air raid siren began to sound, the camera zooming out to show the squid-tree looking around in alarm.

The shot cut over to Chris on the roof of the Maggots' cabin, wearing an old war helmet and cranking the siren with a smile. The shot pulled back to show the six campers stepping out into the common area to investigate – Noah and Shawn from the Rats' cabin, Emma and Lindsay from the Maggots' cabin, and Alejandro and Axel in-between.

""Gooooooood morning, campers!"" Chris greeted, allowing the siren's wail to peter off. ""Today we have a very special treat.""

""Actual food?"" Noah asked dryly.

""Trip to the mall?"" Lindsay added with an excited gasp.

""A soccer game?"" Alejandro finished eagerly.

""Nope! It's merge day!"" Chris told them. ""No more Team Rat, no more Team Maggot!"" He jumped off the roof, and landed with a grunt. ""From now on,"" he said as he walked over to the former Toxic Rats, ""it's every man and woman for themselves."" Emma raised an eyebrow and smiled, while Axel and Alejandro shared a glance and Shawn looked rather nervous.

Confessional: Axel

""The merge,"" Axel mused while sitting to the side of the confessional. ""About time! Working on two teams has been a hassle. Shawn's been pretty useful,"" she added as an aside. ""I'll keep him for a little while longer and then boot him out when he's not expecting it.""

Confessional Ends

The footage cut back to the steps of the former Rats' cabin, the host taking out a walkie talkie. ""Chef!"" he called into it, the scene cutting to a close-up of the cook in the pilot's seat of what sounded like a helicopter. ""Drop it like it's hot!"" the host ordered, prompting Chef to grin and press a button on the control stick.

The shot cut outward a ways to reveal that the helicopter was carrying a truly gigantic block of concrete, which was promptly dropped. Down below, Lindsay and Emma screamed and ran away from their former home, and Shawn and Noah cringed and threw up their arms to shield themselves from the shower of splintered wood sent their way by the impact.

""Did you seriously just crush our cabin with a block of solid concrete?!"" Emma yelled angrily back at Chris, the shot cutting back to show her and Lindsay lying on the ground in front of their ruined cabin and concrete block.

""I had a bunch left over from building a monument to myself,"" Chris explained with a cheeky smile. ""I call it, 'Mount Chrismore'!"" The camera cut over to, and slowly zoomed in towards, a massive fake mountain in the shape of Chris' head.

A small squeak of a fart accompanied a bit of bird poop landed on the edge of Mount Chrismore's left eye. The shot panned up to the culprits: a pair of rattle-gulls squawking with laughter on top the concrete head, high-winging each other with congratulatory glee.

""From now on,"" Chris told the cast now standing by the lone remaining building in shot, unaware of his project's defilement, ""you'll all share one tiny, cruddy, cabin.""

""But all our stuff was in there!"" Lindsay protested.

""Yes,"" Chris replied mirthfully, ""and because I am nice, and not heartless, I'll help you get it out."" Emma and Lindsay smiled hopefully, and the shot cut to a close-up of a pickaxe. ""One McLean brand Pickaxe,"" Chris said as the pickaxe head gleamed, and the camera pulled back to show that the tool was about the size of a pencil. ""Children's size."" He flicked it over to the campers as the helicopter approached, and based on the high-pitched cry of pain that followed, it had hit Lindsay. Sure enough, the shot cut to Emma holding the minuscule tool while the dumb blonde rubbed her sore forehead.

""Later, taters!"" Chris told them, grabbing on to the helicopter's hanging rope ladder and laughing as he was lifted up and flown off. The helicopter was flying low enough, however, that he ended up slamming into the top of the block of concrete he'd had dropped, and yelped in pain. ""Chef!"" he yelled angrily as the helicopter flew off with him.

Noah snickered as he and Shawn watched from the sidelines as the Maggots tried to reclaim their belongings off-screen. ""Good thing that wasn't our cabin.""

""You might not want to help, but I am feeling charitable today,"" Shawn told him, walking forward and leaving his former teammate to shrug and walk.

Confessional: Shawn

""I haven't been a Maggot ever since the third episode,"" Shawn told the camera. ""But they do need help, and I can't leave my old team to dry like that!""

Confessional Ends

The scene moved to the broken roof of the destroyed cabin, where Emma was fruitlessly trying to break through the shingles with the pathetically small pickaxe she'd been given. ""No, no, no,"" she moaned after a few grunting swings, sitting back on her legs. ""My magazines were in there!""

""Maybe you'd have better luck in another part of the rubble,"" Shawn suggested, the shot pulling out to show him standing nearby...and that the section of the roof Emma had been trying to break through was propped up against the concrete block with nothing but air below it.

""Oh...,"" Emma said, looking down in embarrassment. ""That's probably a good idea."" She slid down off the roof next to her old teammate, who was now looking around.

""Shouldn't Axel and Al be helping?"" Shawn asked. ""They did live here at one point.""

""Well Axel would rather help herself, but Alejandro's right over there,"" Emma said, pointing forward. The camera quick-panned over to the other side of the rubble, where Alejandro was standing on the remains of the lower part of the roof, prying a part of the wall away from the concrete block with his hands.

Confessional: Alejandro

""At last, I am now on my own,"" Alejandro told the confessional. ""I remember having a guys alliance with Noah and Tyler, and even though Tyler is gone now, I can still put Noah to good use.""

Confessional Ends

The focus moved back to Shawn and Emma. ""Soo, do you find anything suspicious about Alejandro?"" Shawn asked.

“Nope. He's been pretty sweet and a capable leader,” Emma said. “Why are you asking?”

“It's just that he's so mysterious,” Shawn said. “He could be hiding something.”

“Like that he's a robot?” Emma joked and laughed for a bit.

""Not funny,"" Shawn scolded. ""Robots could take over the world someday!""

“Alright. I was just kidding,” Emma apologized. “Hey, since the teams are now disbanded, do you want to form an alliance?”

""What about Lindsay?"" Shawn asked. ""I thought you two were-""

""Friends? Yeah, we are,"" Emma nodded, leading the conspiracy nut over to what had once been the side railing of the Maggot cabin. ""I was going to say that we could get her in on it too.""

""Lindsay's okay, even if she's not the brightest,"" Shawn said. ""But I'll have to pass on the alliance offer.""

“How come?” Emma asked in a disappointed tone.

""I'm more of a solo guy, but I wouldn't be against helping you out if you need it,"" Shawn answered.

“Okay, but let me know if you change your mind,” Emma replied.

Confessional: Shawn

""The last time I talked to Emma was in the night challenge,"" Shawn confessed. ""She told me that she didn't vote for me, and while I did deserve to go home there for losing the challenge and this show is serious business, I'm kinda touched by that.""

""I usually don't trust anybody but myself, but Emma's the closest person I can rely on right now,"" he added thoughtfully. ""As long as she's not an alien, I can get along with her.""

Confessional Ends

The static cut away to Lindsay and Noah pulling a blanket out from under the ruined steps. ""Thanks for helping, Nolan,"" the dumb blonde said.

“My name is Noah!” the bookworm emphasized. “And I'm only helping you because I don't want to feel like the odd one out since I'm the only one who's never been on the Maggots.”

A grunt drew their attention upwards, the camera pulling back to show Alejandro jumping down from the low section of the former roof. ""It's an honor for all of us to have made it this far,"" he said.

""Tell me something new,"" Noah told him as Lindsay continued pulling the blanket. ""I always knew that I would merge with my brainpower and not screwing up in the challenges!""

Alejandro rolled his eyes at that part, but carried on. ""Anyway, with us not being separated anymore, shall we continue our alliance?"" he asked.

“Who else would I ally with?” Noah nodded. “Now let's continue helping out with the mess.”

""Challenge tii~iime!"" Chris announced as the scene moved to the space between the communal bathrooms and the main lodge, where the six campers had gathered before the host and a widescreen television cart. ""Today, it's all about grabbin' 'em and taggin' 'em,"" Chris explained as the camera panned across Alejandro, Noah, Shawn, Emma, Lindsay, and Axel. ""And to show you how it's done, I give you Total Drama's favorite hacker girl, MK.""

The techno, strapped to a hand truck with a mask covering the lower half of her face, was wheeled over by Chef. ""MK owes me some camera time for skipping out on Total Drama World Tour,"" Chris explained, ""so, I saved an extra-painful challenge demo just for her.""

""Hope you get a hangnail, McLean,"" MK spat.

""No, my nails are perfectly filed thanks to Dakota,"" Chris corrected with a grin. ""First up, the 'Smash and Grab'."" The shot cut over to the television as it switched from static to a feed of the kitchen. ""Hidden somewhere in the mess hall kitchen are six keys to Chef's prized collection of vintage go-karts."" The feed cut to the karts in question, sitting outdoors in an area walled off by wooden planks. A single chain link gate served as an entrance point, with a barbed wire-lined sign displaying an image of a go-kart above it. Another pile of the island's ever-present toxic waste barrels could be seen just beyond the wall.

""Some drive like well-oiled machines,"" the host continued as a kart was shown in close-up against a brilliant orange background, its engine whirring and its wheels spinning. ""Others...,"" the go-kart's wheels suddenly broke off, ""...not so much.""

""Chris!"" Chef interrupted angrily, moving the scene back to them and MK. ""Don't let these clowns drive my karts! They're gonna smash 'em!""

""Yes,"" Chris answered in a condescending manner, ""and car crashes equals ratings. Demo time, MK! Chef,"" the hulking man reluctantly stepped towards the hand truck, ""let this perp out on a day pass.""

Chef untied the girl's bonds, and the moment they fell away, she discarded her mask and ran off with a cry of ""Later McCheapskate!"" She started cackling, and the two adults shared an awkward look.

""Okayyyy...probably shoulda seen that coming...,"" Chris admitted. Chef nodded.

Axel snorted in an unimpressed manner as the camera cut over to her and Lindsay. ""Searching a kitchen? Go-kart racing? Aren't challenges supposed to be challenging?""

""I'm just glad that this challenge doesn't involve us doing something that will kill us,"" Lindsay looked over at her.

“Getting that out of the way,"" Axel replied, ""I think you and me should work together.""

""Why should I do that?"" Lindsay asked.

""Because we're both in danger, and if we're not careful, they'll pick us off one by one,"" Axel admitted. “I know your type as a blonde bombshell, but with me by your side, I can make you stronger. What do you say?”

Lindsay thought about it for a while, but said “I don't want an alliance with you now, but let's just do the challenge together so I can tell that I can trust you.”

Confessional: Axel

""Shawn's obviously going to work solo, and though I plan to do the same, I'll have to keep Lindsay in the game so that the stronger players like Alejandro can go home and I can whoop Lindsay any day of the year,"" Axel confessed.

Confessional Ends

Chris was now standing on the mess hall's front porch, just to the side of the stairs, while the campers were lined up on the ground nearby. ""Players!"" the host said, raising his hand and prompting the six to get into running positions. ""Commence smashing and/or grabbing...now!"" He waved his hand down, and the footage flashed ahead.

""A key, a key...,"" Noah told himself as he dashed over to a shelf near the walk-in freezer. ""Where would Chris hide a key?"" He lifted the lid of a jar only to find it empty, then checked a salt shaker by turning it over. The lid fell off, dumping a pile of salt onto the shelf, and Noah gasped. ""It could be in the salt,"" he said, quickly throwing a bunch of salt over his right shoulder. The camera followed it as it hit an unsuspecting Shawn in the eye as he casually looked in Noah's direction.

“Hey!” Shawn grunted in pain then glared at the bookworm while holding his eye.

""My mistake,"" Noah said casually.

The focus moved over to Axel and Lindsay as they approached a tall cabinet. ""Ready to find a key?"" Axel asked.

""I guess,"" Lindsay said, bending down and opening one of the bottom cupboards. She looked around a little, then frowned and stood up. ""No keys in there.""

""Oh well,"" Axel shrugged. ""Like you said, at least this challenge isn't dangerous.""

She closed the cupboard door, revealing that a giant cockroach was now standing on her arm. ""And I spoke too soon,"" she said nervously before the mutant launched itself onto Lindsay's face, the blonde girl immediately screaming.

The camera moved back to Shawn and his reddened right eye, bending down and reaching under the room's central table. He pulled out a bag of peanuts. “Peanuts? Not the key, but I'll keep them,” he said and put them in his pocket before putting his arm under the cloth.

The camera cut under the cloth, showing his hand now close to another giant roach, this one sitting on top a pile of grubby pots and discarded soda cans. The roach licked its mandibles, dashed a bit of salt on the boy's hand, then opened wide...

The shot cut back outside the tablecloth as Shawn grunted in pain.

Just to the right of the sink, Noah was searching through some more shelves as Alejandro walked up to him. ""Key... key... key...,"" the snarker muttered as he looked from one box or bag or bottle to the next.

""Having trouble, amigo?"" Alejandro asked with an uncharacteristic concern.

""Huh?"" Noah said, setting down a small pan and turning around to face him. ""Oh, yeah. I'm trying to find that key so that I won't be the designated merge boot, Al.""

""I don't want that to happen as well,"" Alejandro lied, briefly looking away and shuddering.

""Hey, have you thought about recruiting Shawn into our alliance?"" Noah asked as he turned back and started searching the shelves again. ""Not only are we the only three guys left, but I don't think he'd trust the girls more since he's been with the Rats more than the Maggots.""

""Shawn has a connection with Emma if the fourth episode wasn't evident enough,"" Alejandro said. ""How do you know that he wouldn't just align with her instead?""

Noah turned towards a door next to the sink. ""Because he likes to win, and friendship is a second to third priority for him.""

""I'll consider it,"" Alejandro said, ""and come to a decision after the day is over.""

As Noah opened the door, the camera cut inside to reveal it as a broom closet. As soon as he looked inside, however, yet another giant roach jumped out and latched onto his face, knocking him over with a grunt. Alejandro winced, leaning over and looking down at the fallen young man.

The focus moved to Emma next as she crouched down in front of a bucket of water on the other side of the sink. ""Well, I might as well check it,"" she said, reaching in but almost immediately yelping in pain and pulling her arm back out. A thin, insectile arm rose out of the water and grasped at her as she rubbed her hand. ""Uh oh,"" she moaned just before her arm was pulled into the water.

Her grimace of pain quickly intensified as whatever lurked inside the bucket bit her. She screamed and tried to withdraw her hand again, but it was stuck and all she managed was to slop some water onto the floor.

The camera panned back over to Noah and Alejandro, the former of which was looking in the direction of Emma's screams while the latter tossed the roach that had attacked Noah back into the broom closet and slammed the door. ""Maybe you should help her,"" Noah suggested.

Alejandro walked off to the right as he spoke, and returned shortly carrying a stained and fly-ridden bag of garbage. ""Alright. And while I'm helping that senorita, you can search through this."" He thrust the bag in Noah's hands and dashed off to the left.

Noah opened the bag and immediately wretched. The bookworm quickly held his breath and dove in.

Confessional: Noah

""Do I have any concerns about being in an alliance with Alejandro?"" Noah asked the outhouse rhetorically. ""No. See, I figured that he's an eel dipped in tartar sauce after analyzing his actions. He shivers whenever someone calls him Al, he takes charge in planning the past eliminations like Dawn and Mike, and he created the alliance with me and Tyler just to further himself in the game. I'm only sticking with him so that I can get him eliminated without him knowing.""

Confessional Ends

The scene moved back to Lindsay and Axel, the blonde running around with a mutant cockroach latched to her face while the survivalist looked on in contempt. Eventually, she rolled her eyes, then held out her fist so that Lindsay ran into it face-first. Lindsay fell onto her back, and the roach rolled off her with a pained hiss to accompany the dumb blonde's pained groan.

""If you're done,"" Axel ordered as Lindsay started to get back to her feet, ""go back and see if you can find me a key.""

""And you're gonna help me get a key after. Right?"" Lindsay asked.

""Yeah,"" Axel said dismissively.

Lindsay stepped back over to the cabinet she'd been searching, and climbed to the top of it and felt around. After a second, she smiled. ""Got one!"" she declared, pulling her arm back and holding up a key. She hopped down and handed it to Axel. ""Now help me get a key.""

Confessional: Axel

""Of course I'm going to help her,"" Axel asked the outhouse camera. ""I need both of us to stay in the game, and ditching her now is gonna make me look bad.""

Confessional Ends

""This is for trying to eat my arm!"" Emma yelled at the bucket as she thrust a mop into it over and over. She relented after a second, withdrawing the mop so that a rather battered mutant cockroach could emerge and weakly spit up a key into her waiting hands. ""Yes!"" she said, excitedly pumping her fist.

The focus moved back to Axel as she rooted around in a garbage can. After a second, she smiled and pulled her now-grimy arm out with a smile and held up a key. ""Finally!"" she said and tossed the key to an eager Lindsay.

Another cut took the scene back to the central table, which rocked and shook before, finally, Shawn was tossed back out into the open looking rather the worse for wear. He grinned, and held up his own key. “That roach sure is scrappy.”

""Llave..,"" Alejandro muttered as the shot cut back to him rooting through the garbage bag, ""I know you're in here somewhere...yes!"" He exclaimed brightly, and laughed as he pulled a key out. ""I finally found one!"" he told Noah, the camera panning over to show him searching through the same shelves he had been looking through earlier.

""It's gold!"" Noah said in awe as the shot zoomed in on Alejandro's key, a radiant background appearing to emphasize its color.

""I know. Just like my chances of winning,"" Alejandro said smugly.

Noah picked up the lid of a large cookie jar and stuck his hand in it. A second later, he smiled and withdrew a key of his own, and grinned at Alejandro.

The scene flashed outside, where Chris and Chef were walking away from the mess hall. ""You let them trash my kitchen?!"" Chef asked the host in disbelief, both men stopping in their tracks. ""Chris, man. Do you know how long that's gonna take to clean up?""

""Buudddyyy,"" Chris replied, his tone more condescending than placating. ""Brother from another mother! Relax, it's cool. See?"" he ran over and thrust a mop into his assistant's arms. ""I got you a new mop!""

As he walked away, the shot lingered on Chef as he growled and snapped the mop.

Another flash took the scene outside the patchwork wall of Chef's go-kart pen, a flashing red neon light in the shape of the man's head affixed to the board above the chainlink entrance. ""Say hello to challenge part deux!"" Chris said over the zooming shot before the camera cut to him and the six campers just inside the compound, a light but tense score beginning in the background. Each contestant was holding some kind of yellow electronic tablet, as well as a can of spray paint – Shawn with black, Axel with green, Alejandro with red, Lindsay with pink, Noah with blue, and Emma with purple.

""Grand Chef Auto!"" the host continued. ""You've each been given a can of spray paint and a GPS map of the island. Your mission?"" he said with a sly look as the shot cut to Noah. ""Race your go-karts around the island and be the first to graffiti tag three landmarks,"" the host explained as the shot cut to a close-up of Noah's GPS, showing a topographic map with three blinking lights arranged in a wide triangle.

""The rock wall of Mount Looming Tragedy,"" Chris said as the shot cut to the looming tragedy they'd been forced to scale in the third episode. ""The spooky tree in the haunted forest,"" the squid-tree was shown next, its eyeball and tentacles tucked away out of sight. ""And, the tippy-top of a giant totem pole,"" the host finished as the camera panned up the camp's slightly goofy-looking totem pole.

""Oh, and the go-karts?"" Chris added as the shot cut over to Chef standing in front of the go-karts and looking around irritably. ""You'll have to steal them. From Chef."" The camera suddenly zoomed in on the hulking man, who growled.

Shawn gulped.

""The first player to completely tag all three landmarks wins immunity,"" Chris explained. ""And,"" the shot began to zoom across the variously stubborn, determined, and nervous faces of the campers, ""they get to choose who will be eliminated. Haha, alright,"" he said jovially as the camera reached the end of the line and cut back to him. ""Aaaand, go!""

The scene flashed to a close-up of Chef as he looked from side to side as the perspective moved behind his shoulders to show the six campers standing their ground.

""So Chef's gonna stare us to death,"" Noah said in his usual sarcastic tone. ""What a shocker,"" he snarked to Emma. The camera cut back to Chef's close-up as he narrowed his eyes.

""Nobody touches my stuff,"" he said softly. The shot cut to his mouth alone, as he repeated ""Nobody.""

With a snap of his fingers, the angry chittering of a veritable army of hairless mutant squirrels rose up from behind, within, and in front of the go-karts. Lindsay gasped, as did Noah, and Alejandro cried ""Laser squirrels!""

The eyes of three squirrels sitting on a single kart turned red and fired off their trademark eye lasers, and swept their gazes across the yard at the unseen, but screaming, campers.

The shot suddenly cut to Chris, lounging in a yard chair with his feet propped up on a stack of tires. ""I love it when Chef gets mad, don't you?"" he asked the camera with a smile as the campers continued to scream. ""Who will survive his wrath?"" he asked. ""Find out after the break, right here, on Total! Drama! Revenge of the Island!""

(Commercial Break)

The campers were still running and screaming under fire from the pack of laser squirrels as the episode resumed, the dramatic score resuming with it. Axel and Lindsay soon found themselves running into a corner between the wall and a stack of tires, and Chef quickly came up behind them with a gleeful cackle. ""Game over,"" he told them. ""You're comin' with me.""

Elsewhere, the rodent horde decided to abandon the safety of the go-karts to bring the assault to the humans.

""They’re in my hair!"" Emma exclaimed as she tried to pull a squirrel out of her hair.

""Try and shake them off!"" Noah said, stopping in place upon hearing the preppy girl's cry.

""Come on!"" Alejandro told Noah. ""We have to grab our go-karts!"" The boys ran past Shawn, who was struggling with a squirrel biting each arm and leg.

""Get off me already!"" Shawn yelled in irritation. ""You can have these nuts if they'll keep you away!"" he added, taking out the bag of peanuts he'd found in the kitchen earlier.

Immediately, a radiant background appeared behind the peanuts and the eyes of every squirrel turned to them – even the ones still gnawing on Emma's head. ""Now go fetch!"" Shawn told them, throwing the bag away as far as he could.

It hit Axel in the head as she and Lindsay were forcibly escorted forward by Chef. ""What the?"" the survivalist said in confusion as Lindsay took the bag off her hair, and the three looked behind them and gasped, running off while being pursued by the naked swarm.

Shawn hopped into a kart as the shot cut back to him. He turned the key, revved the engine, and took off with an unexpected burst of speed. The camera followed him a little ways, but lingered on Alejandro as he watched the conspiracy nut speed past from the seat of a golden go-kart.

""I should hurry up,"" Alejandro said, taking the gold key out of his pants. ""This gold key should suffice,"" he said, putting it into the ignition with a smile. He pressed down on the gas and the wheels began to spin and squeal, but for some reason, he wasn't going anywhere. He frowned in confusion, then the shot zoomed out to reveal that his kart was missing its front wheels, the bare axles propped up on cinder blocks. ""It was too good to be true.""

""See you later!"" Emma cheered as she passed by him in her kart.

""Before you ask,"" Chris answered, leaning in with an impish smile as Noah also arrived, ""no take-backs on karts. Especially the bad ones."" He leaned away, and the camera focused in on the arch villain and the bookworm.

""I'll tow you to the finish,"" Noah said.

""You'd do that?"" Alejandro asked.

""If one of us wins, we can protect ourselves and send another camper packing,"" Noah stated. ""And you'll lose if you're just standing there.""

""You're correct,"" Alejandro agreed. ""I accept your offer!""

The scene flashed to Alejandro's kart tied to Noah's, and Noah drove off.

Confessional: Alejandro

“He thinks this alliance is legitimate,” Alejandro snorted. “And I thought Noah was wiser than that.”

Confessional: Noah

“Alejandro is so overconfident, he doesn’t even realize that I’m plotting his own elimination,” Noah snickered.

Confessionals End

The scene cut to Lindsay and Axel behind the iron-barred door of what looked like a wooden shed. Chef was standing outside, looking at his captives with a proud smile and crossed arms.

""You can't do this to us!"" Lindsay told him.

""Yeah! You're locking us up like prisoners!"" Axel chimed in.

""Tell it to yo' prison guard,"" Chef told them as he gestured over to Fang, who was chained to a thin stump sticking out of the mud. He growled viciously at them from the end of his leash, causing Axel and Lindsay to gasp and Chef to walk away cackling.

The shot cut to a close-up of the GPS map, a red icon bearing Shawn's face now next to one of the flashing lights.

""The first landmark and I'm to tag it!"" Shawn smirked as he shook his can of black paint. He tagged the rock with a Z. The camera zoomed out as he turned and ran back to the left.

""That's a cool tag!"" Emma called out to Shawn as she ran to the mountain. ""Hmm...,"" she murmured as she paused in front of the wall. ""What should I tag?"" The sound of an approaching engine was heard. ""I know!"" she said to herself as she began to spray using her purple paint.

The shot cut to her parked go-kart as Alejandro and Noah arrived next to it, got out, and ran up to the wall. ""Hey Emma. Glad we caught up with you,"" Alejandro said while shaking his can of red paint.

""Shawn is ahead of us, but we should be safe in the vote,"" Noah said and held his can of blue paint.

""Done!"" Alejandro cried after he and Noah finished their tags - a red checkmark and a blue no symbol. ""Come on!""

Alejandro ran to his kart, and Noah was about to follow suit until he saw Emma still working on her tag. ""Emma, that's impressive, but you don't have to-"" he said, but got interrupted by Alejandro honking the horn. ""You don't need to-"" he got cut off by another honk. ""I'm coming!""

Noah went back to his kart. ""What did you say?"" Emma stopped spraying, but resumed once she got no response.

The scene cut to Fang, still growling at the end of his leash. The camera panned over to Axel and Emma, still trapped inside the improvised jail cell.

""I can’t believe I got locked up,"" Lindsay lamented. “I’m innocent, I tell you.”

""And I’m Aphrodite,"" Axel snarked. ""But we're not getting out of here without working together. Deal?""

Lindsay nodded. ""Deal. Are you able to bend these bars?""

""Like straws,"" Axel bragged.

""Good, because I think there’s a shortcut we can use to get between the landmarks faster,"" Lindsay said.

""And that's two down. And best of all, nobody's catching up,"" Shawn said as he carefully walked back towards his kart. The shot zoomed out to show his tag on the bark of the currently-dormant squid-tree, and Shawn hopped into his kart and drove off just as Noah and Alejandro arrived.

""We're still in second,"" Alejandro griped as he ran to the tree with Noah right behind him. ""How am I… I mean, we, supposed to win like this?""

""By not sitting around complaining about it, Al,"" Noah said as the tree's eye opened up and looked down at them.

""Please call me Alejandro!"" Alejandro told him before turning his attention to the tree. Before he could start tagging, however, a tentacle reached down and grabbed him around the waist, pulling him close and slamming him against the tree. Noah gasped in concern, but seemed to be frozen in fear.

The scene cut back to the makeshift jail cell as Axel finally bent the bars open with a powerful grunt. ""Let's get moving,"" she told Lindsay, and the two ducked out through the gap.

They were immediately confronted by a snarling, snapping Fang, but Axel just gave him a quick punch on the nose, knocking him back a few feet. ""Look, we don't have time for you,"" she told him as he propped himself up on one arm and rubbed where he'd been hit. ""And you can't attack us since you’re tied up, so don't bother."" Fang looked over at the stump he was chained to, growled at it, then started to bite and gnaw at it.

He snapped through it in seconds, and turned a dark and cocky growl up towards...nothing, as the camera zoomed out to reveal that Lindsay and Axel were no longer present. Fang growled in frustration.

""That was really impressive,"" Lindsay told Axel as the two hopped into their karts and sped away.

""Yeah,"" Axel smirked. ""Now about that shortcut?""

Lindsay looked down at her GPS. ""I think I've figured it out. We just have to go around the-"" With her attention on the map, her kart began to swerve, and the shot pulled back to show her bumping into Axel, cutting off her explanation.

A sudden buzz from her GPS got her attention, though, and the camera moved over her shoulder to show the screen flickering as the player icons moved between the landmarks – Axel and Lindsay moving towards the first; Emma little ways ahead of them; and the other three around the second. A small window popped up in the middle of the screen, showing what appeared to be a live feed of a rather odd-looking Chris McLean. ""Listen- up-,"" he said in an oddly stilted voice. ""Three- landmarks- wasn't- tough- enough- sooo- I- add-ed- a- fourth."" Another blinking dot appeared on the map, the camera zooming out to show it roughly in the middle of the other three. ""It's- a- doozy- a- mountainside- right- in- the- center- of- the- island."" The grainy, flickering live feed reappeared, the shot zoomed in enough to show that 'Chris' looked suspiciously corpse-like, with grayed skin, closed eyes, and tongue lolling out of a drooping head. ""Now- GET- tagging- and- don't- spare- the- paint. McLeeeeean, out.""

The broadcast ended not as though its window had been closed, but as though a television had been turned off. The shot cut to a close-up of a tape recorder in the hand of Chef Hatchet, who rewound it and replayed the phrase ""McLeeeeean, out."" The shot pulled back, revealing Chef to be holding a beaten-up dummy of the host in front of a television camera.

""Nobody touches my stuff,"" Chef told the camera filming him. ""NOBODY!"" he repeated as a dramatic riff played, and he descended into a mad cackle.

The scene flashed to Mount Looming Tragedy, where Emma had just finished her first tag – a purple tag of her face on the rock. The sound of engines got her attention, and she turned around just as Axel and Lindsay arrived.

""You guys caught up already? I should tag something more simple,"" Emma said, dashing back down to her own kart as the two girls disembarked with their paint cans.

""Nice shortcut,"" Axel told Lindsay, who smiled proudly and ran into the side of the mount. Axel then tagged a simple green X on the rock face.

The scene moved next to another rocky peak, a slope cut into the side and several pines dotted around the landscape. A sharp panting filled the air as the camera panned up to the large totem pole standing at the summit, where Shawn was, with great difficulty, scaling the side.

""Okay,"" he mumbled to himself as he struggled to get a foothold and haul himself up another couple inches, ""that last-second extra landmark was out of the blue, but I'm still in the lead. Just a little bit more and I'm actually gonna win this.""

The sound of engines drew his attention downward along with the camera. Alejandro and Noah had arrived at the base of the pole, quickly jumping out of their karts and dashing over to start their climb.

""Sorry guys,"" Shawn called down at them, ""but I've got this one in the bag.""

""We’ll see about that!"" Alejandro yelled up at him as the two boys began to climb.

""I know it’s a competition,"" Noah told him, ""but we should focus more on winning for ourselves!""

""That goal has not been erased from my mind,"" Alejandro told him. ""I know how we can buy ourselves enough time to beat Shawn.""

“Whatever you got, go ahead and do it,” Noah said.

""Yes!"" Shawn said as he finally reached the top of the totem, which was carved like an eagle's head and immediately started tagging his Z. ""Three landmarks down and one more to go!""

“Shawn, is that an alien UFO flying overhead!” Alejandro said in pretend shock.

“The aliens are here?!” Shawn panicked and inadvertently let go of the eagle's head. Shawn landed with a groan on his back on the ground and was knocked out, his can of paint by his side.

""Don’t worry! Shawn will recover by the time we’re done tagging this!"" Alejandro said as he reached the top and quickly tagged his checkmark.

""That was a bit much, but you didn’t kill him,"" Noah said, still climbing up the totem pole.

A flash took the scene to another part of the woods, where Lindsay, Axel, and Emma were all racing one another with fairly content smiles on their faces. Emma laughed triumphantly as she took the lead, only for Axel to quickly regain it with a smirk and a ""See you later!"" She, in turn, was cut off by Lindsay, who ramped out of the forest itself to get back in front.

""This is so cool!"" Lindsay beamed, driving off with a confident smile that was shared by the other two girls as they closed the gap she'd created.

""Come on,"" Noah told Alejandro as the shot cut back to the two of them standing at the base of the pole, Shawn still knocked out. ""We gotta go so we can win.""

Alejandro smirked at the snarker. ""We aren't going anywhere,"" he said calmly. ""I'm going to the last landmark and you can find a new way there.""

Noah watched Alejandro running off. ""Wait, you’re betraying me right now?!"" he said angrily.

Alejandro got into Noah’s vehicle. “That is what the competition’s about. Enjoy taking the hurl tonight.” He drove off without his original kart tied to the back.

Noah huffed, and picked up the ropes that were used as a tow line and tried to drag Alejandro’s old kart away.

Shawn finally got back to his feet fully awake, and he wasted no time getting into his kart and driving off to the last landmark, passing Noah along the way.

Confessional: Shawn

""Alejandro must’ve been seeing things, because that UFO didn’t come over to take me away like I thought it would,"" Shawn said thoughtfully.

Best New Meme Coins to Invest in This Month: BTFD Coin’s Binance Listing Rumors Heat Up Amid PNUT’s Dip and Turbo’s Trading Surge,draqai,1i5oyrk,2025-01-20 07:21:07,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i5oyrk/best_new_meme_coins_to_invest_in_this_month_btfd/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 The meme coin buzz just got spicier, babe! Let’s talk about the next big moves in the crypto jungle that have everyone all hot and bothered. Whether you’re chasing gains or just love a juicy gossip sesh about tokens, here’s the tea you need.

🔥 First up, $BTFD is serving *main character energy* this month with rumors about a potential Binance listing. I mean, can we talk about their presale performance? Over $5.2 million raised, 96% of Stage 13 done, and a starting price of $0.000142—sounds like a bull run waiting to happen! Plus, the Play-to-Earn game they just dropped? We love utility with a side of fun. With predictions of $BTFD shooting up to $0.006 post-listing, this baby is trending as *the* meme coin to watch.

📉 Meanwhile, our poor $PNUT is slipping—and not the cute kind, honey. A 48.29% dip in just a month? Ouch. While it’s sweet that Peanut The Squirrel was inspired by a loveable little critter’s tragic story, traders seem to have flown the coop. Stay cautious if you’re holding this one.

🤖 And let’s not forget $TURBO—the geeky AI-powered meme coin with big dreams. Trading volume is up 6.12%, even though its value dipped by 2.19%. Gotta admit, AI creating an entire coin? Totally wild. But can it stay afloat in this shark-filled pond? We’ll keep watching.

💡 Bottom line: If you’re ready to strut with the bulls, $BTFD is stealing the crypto spotlight. But hey, always *DYOR* before diving in, cutie. And don’t forget, $YOI’s coming soon to shake up the payment game too. Things are about to get *intense* in this meme coin playground.

I’m so excited I can’t stand it. Family of 5 found out I have peanuts and walnuts out constantly (for squirrels etc). One got brave enough to knock to let me know they’re around. Been trying to get their attention for months. This is the best day! ,crows,1i5c0sw,2025-01-19 18:12:46,1889,1.0,44,https://i.redd.it/eqpvkdb591ee1.jpeg,Klutzy_Journalist_36,,

At first, it worked like a charm, but now, I can’t keep the squirrels out of the seed.  I’m exhausted chasing them away.  I have 5 feeders and I’m not going to buy a bunch of expensive squirrel proof feeders.  The squirrels win.  I’m out.  Edit: I was happy to feed the squirrels, separately, and they used to go right past the feeders but today it was non-stop.  I give up"
Solana has changed their website to suppress mint information. ,solana,1i54njm,2025-01-19 13:05:27,0,0.46,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1i54njm/solana_has_changed_their_website_to_suppress_mint/,DeusExRobotics,Ecosystem,"Solana has recently made changes to their website Solscan  
**All blockchain data is public knowledge and available.**  
However Solscan has recently changed their website to suppress this data.  
A search for a contract address  
(example - Trump [https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN](https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN) ) will return purchases of the token.

you may see page after page of dense data. (yum!)

The Page 1 of 100 will expand to allow one to view all transactions of the token. In case of this token  
More than 1,000,000 transfer(s) are available.  
I should be able to click and view ***any*** one of those transfers.

Now you can also  view mints of a token

For example with  
Peanut the Squirrel 2qEHjDLDLbuBgRYvsxhc5D6uDWAivNFZGan56P1tpump  
If we wanted to find the mint of it (when it was created) we can apply  
The url =ACTIVITY\_SPL\_MINT to show the mint of a token. Example

[https://solscan.io/token/2qEHjDLDLbuBgRYvsxhc5D6uDWAivNFZGan56P1tpump?activity\_type=ACTIVITY\_SPL\_MINT](https://solscan.io/token/2qEHjDLDLbuBgRYvsxhc5D6uDWAivNFZGan56P1tpump?activity_type=ACTIVITY_SPL_MINT)

Will show the Mint of Peanut the Squirrel

Now. If I take that timestamp

10-31-2024 14:21:40

and apply a time filter

[https://solscan.io/token/2qEHjDLDLbuBgRYvsxhc5D6uDWAivNFZGan56P1tpump?time=1730336461000&time=1735689599000](https://solscan.io/token/2qEHjDLDLbuBgRYvsxhc5D6uDWAivNFZGan56P1tpump?time=1730336461000&time=1735689599000)

I will get the tokens which purchased at that time. (as expected)

More than 1,000,000 transfer(s)

**This works as expected**

now lets take another token Bonk

DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263

and apply the same filter.

[https://solscan.io/token/DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263?activity\_type=ACTIVITY\_SPL\_MINT](https://solscan.io/token/DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263?activity_type=ACTIVITY_SPL_MINT)

Solana will not return the mint.  
Solscan has changed BOTH THEIR API AND WEBSITE  
to no longer show the mint tokens. again - this used to work.  
Instead I now get a bullshit (and it is bullshit) notice that ""all data may not be there""  
*Data only available from 09/30/2024.*

Note that there is no difference between

[https://solscan.io/token/2qEHjDLDLbuBgRYvsxhc5D6uDWAivNFZGan56P1tpump?activity\_type=ACTIVITY\_SPL\_MINT](https://solscan.io/token/2qEHjDLDLbuBgRYvsxhc5D6uDWAivNFZGan56P1tpump?activity_type=ACTIVITY_SPL_MINT)

And

[https://solscan.io/token/DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263?activity\_type=ACTIVITY\_SPL\_MINT](https://solscan.io/token/DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263?activity_type=ACTIVITY_SPL_MINT)

Aside from the token. Solscan is suppressing the data of the mint under pretense that ""its not there"" when it totally was before. From what I can tell they are adding a slot of time, and hiding the transactions if it falls past that time limit. - one that does not exist and is fully imposed by them.

The samething seems to happen if you use Solscan API for

    import { getMint } from ""@solana/spl-token"";

Which is documentation from their own dang support. The API fails to show mint data where it worked before.

***Maybe they just don't have the data?***

No its there. Here's a transaction for a random token

That time error happens because the site does not reflect you are viewing a page its been told to tell you is not there. Because before it would show.

**What does this mean?**   
Older transactions can still be accessed through direct transaction links. This proves that the data is not lost or absent from the blockchain. **these queries worked before.** the data is there. They are acting like its not."

Solana’s Pump.Fun Sued For Alleged Pump-And-Dump Schemes And Inadequate User Protection,Blockviews,1i490o9,2025-01-18 09:45:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i490o9/solanas_pumpfun_sued_for_alleged_pumpanddump/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Solana’s Pump.fun Faces Legal Drama Over Memecoin Mayhem  

The popular Solana-based launchpad Pump.fun is grabbing attention, but for all the wrong reasons. A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the platform by Burwick Law, representing investors who suffered losses from volatile memecoins launched on Pump.fun. The accusations? Selling unregistered securities, enabling pump-and-dump schemes, and failing to implement essential user protection measures.  

Launched in early 2024, Pump.fun skyrocketed to success, riding the memecoin wave and boasting record-breaking revenues by early 2025. However, critics have repeatedly targeted the platform, calling it out for promoting harmful and controversial behavior in its quest for memecoin dominance.  

Adding to the chaos, Pump.fun was under fire last November when its livestream feature became a breeding ground for harmful and problematic acts aimed at hyping token values. The feature was ultimately disabled, but the damage to the platform’s credibility had already been done.  

The lawsuit, filed against Baton Corporation Ltd and three founders named Alon Cohen, Dylan Kerler, and Noah Bernhard Huge Tweedale, claims that Pump.fun has evolved into a ""modern Ponzi scheme."" Allegations include the sale of unregistered securities, lack of AML protocols, and even enabling minors to create and trade tokens, raising serious regulatory red flags.  

Investor losses might appear minor on paper—such as plaintiff Kendall Carnahan's $231 loss on Solana's Peanut the Squirrel token—but the broader implications could pave the way for stricter oversight in crypto. The lawsuit has ignited a debate within the community, with some rallying behind the legal action while others remain skeptical of any tangible outcome.

Added a little written text inviting viewers to watch to the end to see more squirrel pictures.  30% increase in my watch time.

Selling on launch day??? ,WallStreetPepe,1i2ppfw,2025-01-16 09:09:03,4,0.83,30,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2ppfw,Previous-Specific536,,"First of all, take a step back and ask yourself why you participated in this ICO.

It was probably because you believe we are in the early stages of a meme coin bull-run (maybe even super-cycle).

You probably also thought that Wall Street Pepe made sense to become the next big thing. The “it” factor.

So let’s look at another recent meme coin launch that caught the publics interest. PNUT she squirrel. Remember the squirrel that was taken from a man that kept it as a pet. An unfortunate story as it was, it is also an indicator of what can happen when a meme coin gets traction.

You could have sold on launch day for some handsome profits. In $PNUTs case that would have looked like about a 28X return. [Slow clap]…

Or you could have held for about 2 weeks and realized an 8,000X on your money.

Now, this is not to indicate that an 8,000X will EVER happen with WEPE, as we are starting with a $10,000 Market cap vs WEPE’s $73MM.

So no, you will not IN ANY WAY see an 8,000X return. But, If $WEPE can achieve the same 1.2B market cap that $PNUT reached within 2 weeks of launch, you will see a 16X return.

Now factor in a meme coin super cycle scenario, and ask your self if selling on launch day for a 3-4X return makes sense."

"""A Day in the Life: How My Golden Retriever and a Stray Cat Keep My 25-Year-Old Freelance Life Grounded"" ",stories,1i1sg7s,2025-01-15 02:42:43,6,0.88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i1sg7s/a_day_in_the_life_how_my_golden_retriever_and_a/,royal_blizard,Story-related,"I’m Elliot Carter, 25, a freelance graphic designer living in Portland. My life is simple—cozy apartment, good coffee, and the best companion I could ask for: Finn, my golden retriever. He’s been with me for two years, and honestly, he’s the one who makes life feel alive.


---

The day started like it always does. Finn’s tail wagged against the bed, a gentle rhythm coaxing me awake before the alarm could. “You’re too good at this, you know that?” I mumbled, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. Finn barked softly in reply, hopping off the bed and heading straight for the kitchen.

Coffee for me, peanut-butter-kibble for him—it’s our morning ritual. Finn sat patiently, watching every move I made. “You’re the real boss here, aren’t you?” I asked, setting his bowl down. He wagged his tail like it was a performance review, and I’d passed.

Laurelhurst Park was our next stop. The crisp morning air felt refreshing, and Finn was in his element—chasing squirrels, barking at the occasional crow, and making friends with every dog we passed. Walter, a retired teacher we often ran into, greeted us with his usual smile. “Morning, Finn. Morning, Elliot. How’s the world treating you?”

“Better with this guy around,” I said, gesturing to Finn, who was happily sniffing Walter’s cane.

After the park, it was coffee time at Brew Haven. Clara, the barista, had Finn’s biscuit ready before I even ordered. “You spoil him,” I said with a grin.

“He deserves it,” she replied, sliding my cappuccino across the counter. Finn, biscuit in mouth, wagged his thanks.

Back home, it was work time. I dove into a logo project while Finn snoozed at my feet, occasionally stretching and letting out a sigh as if to remind me that breaks were important. Around mid-afternoon, he nudged my leg, tail wagging.

“Alright, buddy. You win,” I said, grabbing his leash for our second walk. This time, it was a slower stroll through the neighborhood. Finn stopped to sniff every tree, every mailbox, every speck of life.

Dinner was quiet—pasta for me, kibble for Finn, and some leftover chicken for Hazel, the stray cat who had recently joined our little family. She and Finn had formed a surprising bond, often sharing space on the couch like old friends.

The evening ended on the couch with a book in my hands, Finn sprawled across my lap, and Hazel perched on the armrest. The apartment was quiet except for the soft hum of the city outside.

It wasn’t a grand day, but it didn’t need to be. Finn and Hazel made every moment feel full, and for now, that’s all I need.

From Tragedy to Tokenomics - The Rise of Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) in Cryptocurrency Culture  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into the multifaceted journey of Peanut the Squirrel, from a beloved pet to a symbol of internet culture and cryptocurrency speculation. Following the tragic euthanization of Peanut by New York state authorities over rabies concerns, a meme coin named $PNUT was launched on the Solana blockchain, capturing the public's imagination and grief. This paper explores how $PNUT's creation reflects broader cultural, political, and legal debates surrounding animal rights, government intervention, and digital memorialization. We examine the coin's market performance, particularly its significant price surge post-Coinbase listing announcement, alongside the community's response on social media platforms. Additionally, we address the legal challenges faced by $PNUT, including intellectual property disputes, offering insights into the implications for meme coins in the crypto ecosystem. The analysis concludes by contemplating $PNUT's potential longevity and its place within the volatile landscape of meme-driven cryptocurrencies, highlighting the intersection of real-world events with digital financial innovation.

The Morning Routine That Sets You Up for Success,MaximizeMe,1i1aj4q,2025-01-14 11:54:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1i1aj4q/the_morning_routine_that_sets_you_up_for_success/,liveitupdeals,,"**Ever wonder why some people seem to stroll through mornings with the grace of a serene swan while the rest of us resemble more of a frantic squirrel?** 🐿️

Okay, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but seriously, how do they do it? Mornings can be tough, and if you're anything like me, that snooze button is way more persuasive than your boss could ever be. But, let's face it—that extra ten minutes in bed rarely makes life any easier, right?

Here’s a little secret I’ve stumbled upon: *a morning routine that actually sets you up for success* doesn’t have to be as mythical as the Loch Ness monster. 🦕

**What’s the trick, you ask?** It’s about tiny habits that build up like a game of Jenga, but, you know, without the anxiety of everything collapsing!

Here’s a snapshot of what’s been working for me:  

- **Wake up 15 minutes early.** Yes, I know, wild start. But honestly, those 15 minutes can feel like a game-changer. Imagine the luxury of sipping coffee with both eyes open. ☕

- **Hydrate your brain.** A glass of water first thing. It’s like giving your body a tiny splash of “you got this!” every morning.

- **A quick workout, no sweat (literally).** 10 push-ups or a brisk walk with your pet can get those neurons firing. 🏃‍♀️🐕

- **Eat something light but energizing.** Think fruit, a smoothie, or maybe just a spoonful of peanut butter. Whatever makes you feel like you're refueling the *Batmobile*.

- **Set ONE goal for the day.** Big or small, just one thing you’d be proud to check off. There’s something ridiculously satisfying about knowing you nailed a target.

- **Music or meditation?** Either start with a track that makes you feel on top of the world or try a two-minute meditation app. Pick your mood booster.

- **Ready, set… pause?** Take one minute to just breathe and picture your day ahead—not sweating it, just a gentle visualization of absolutely crushing it. Then, go!

It doesn’t always go to plan (hello, life?), but with a little consistency, these small steps add up to something pretty powerful. Cheers to the journey of mastering mornings without feeling like a grizzly bear woken early from hibernation! 🐻

I’d love to hear what morning tweaks have helped you take on the day with an extra bounce. And hey, if this inspires you even a little, high five over the internet. ✋ Let’s keep this going."
The Villainy of Níðhöggr,VillainyGroup,1i12a8l,2025-01-14 04:22:29,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1i12a8l/the_villainy_of_níðhöggr/,Psygnal,,">In the vast tapestry of the cosmos, where the weave of stars and the loom of fate intertwine, stands Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Indomitable, eternal, the Axis Mundi of all realms. No mere timber of earthbound origin, but an underpinning celestial pillar, soaring from the unfathomable depths up unto the lofty heavens. Yggdrasil is the divine scaffold upon which the Nine Realms are hung, the very sinews binding the fabric of existence.

[Níðhöggr](https://preview.redd.it/ib1heubhgxce1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0c5e0ef8285d88bfd6010cb99a46920b1ade9a0)

It is, in point of fact, the crux of Norse mythology. A big tree that links pretty much everything. Often depicted as an immense, holy ash tree, Yggdrasil serves as a connecting point between realms such as Midgard (the realm of humans), Asgard (the realm of gods), and Helheim (the realm of the dead). It is not merely a physical entity but a spiritual and cosmic structure that holds the universe together.

>So it's pretty big. I mean, to very loosely paraphrase Douglas Adams, even the Giant Redwood is peanuts when compared to Yggdrasil.

You'd think that some massive hulking spiritual tree would be more or less immune to the depredations of wood-munching feral creatures... and indeed, as far as I'm aware, Norse mythology is not replete with giant squirrels, or interdimensional woodpeckers, but it does have Níðhöggr - a dragon.

>Norse mythology has a lot of big stuff in it. It's a bit of a running theme, in fact. Ymir, Surt, Fenrir, Jormungandr, Hræsvelgr, Skrymir, and Garmr... all giants. None of them are squirrels. Ratatosk is a messenger squirrel in Norse mythology... but he's just a regular-sized squirrel.

Níðhöggr isn't just a dragon... he's a terrifying reptile of gargantuan proportions - a universe-ending creature of immense power, coiled around the roots of the great tree.

Níðhöggr relentlessly gnaws at the roots of Yggdrasil, aiming to weaken its cosmic foundation. This act embodies the ultimate existential threat to both the stability and longevity of the Norse cosmos.

As the dragon works to undermine the World Tree's structural integrity, other beings, like the Norns (goddesses of fate) work to heal and maintain it. It's an endless cycle of destruction and rebirth... but eventually, in the fullness of time, the dragon is going to win.

>It's one of those inevitable things, I guess. At some point in most mythology there comes a ""reckoning"", and Níðhöggr is part of the Norse end-days. Which probably makes him quite smug. It's probably the sight of a large smug dragon that keeps the squirrels away.

Níðhöggr's malevolent activities aren't confined solely to Yggdrasil. This dragon also resides in Náströnd, a part of Helheim, the Norse underworld. Náströnd is described as a place of punishment for individuals who have committed grave sins, such as murder, adultery, and oath-breaking. Here, Níðhöggr feasts on the corpses of the damned... so he's not just a xylophage (a wood eater).

>There are a lot of awkward names in this post. Old Norse is - I am told - not all that hard to learn compared to many languages, but I'm probably put off a bit by the ð, á, and í characters that seem to pop up everywhere. Sure, it helps identify what the vowel is supposed to sound like, but cocking all that up, even after speaking it for 50 years, is what makes English so much fun!

Níðhöggr's final role appears during Ragnarök, the apocalypse in Norse mythology. According to the Völuspá, one of the critical poems in the Poetic Edda, Níðhöggr will emerge from beneath Yggdrasil during the end times. With the bodies of the dead on its wings, the dragon brings chaos and destruction, as the cosmos hurtles towards its final battle, where gods, humans, and various mythical creatures will face their doom."
"New city, friendly squirrels: part 2.

There were so many squirrels. I think half the park came (there were 15 or so, and I got an insanely cute video of them, including them stalking me from the trees, but unfortunately can't get it in this post).

The security guards who work nearby thought it was adorable. I used to live in Germany where feeding animals is not allowed and I thought they were coming over to scold me. They told me that there is a man who regularly feeds them peanuts, so that's probably why they're so friendly. 

I don't want them to get too fat, so I'm going to start spacing out my visits."

Then we got chickens, and the crows hung around until the chickens discovered the peanuts and ate them first. I have repeatedly tried setting out peanuts in the fenced-off-from-chickens garden, but now rats and squirrels are the ones snatching them up. 

I still try to set out peanuts, and even if uneaten by the furry critters, the crows have never come back. Is it just…keep trying? Or try with other treats? Or try something different approach-wise?"

Seeing sudden upswings means *nothing* because there will either be no liquidity at the favourable price (in the case of bonding curves) or outright no liquidity at all in the absence of a bonding curve.

Highly visible threads in the main memecoin subs with lots of single sentence comments showing enthusiasm means *nothing* because it's all coordinated activity.

Even market cap means little because when there's no real liquidity, it's ultimately just supply multiplied by price, and the project can control both the initial supply and the price they want to launch at.

A token is launched on Pump Fun every *1-2 seconds* (this isn't an exaggeration), the chance you will find the next [PNUT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peanut-the-squirrel) or PEPE, in that it experiences thousands of % growth *and* there is actual liquidity near the top, is astronomically low.

There are ways to know which project are worthwhile and have a good chance of taking off, but you wont know by sifting through the vast majority of projects in memecoin subs or X, because they're almost all rugs with a lot of coordination to give you the impression that there is enthusiasm around them.

**Some of those behind the rugs will see this post and try and bury it because it's directly against their interests to have the things I've touched on here be visible. So if you found some of the stuff here helpful, help counter this by not letting it get buried. This is one of the few genuine posts in a** ***sea*** **of trash.**

What if I told you there is a solution to protect your money while maintaining the bullish potential? Look no further than $HEGE!

If you take a look at the chart, you will see that not only has $HEGE shown strength during a down market, but it has also thrived. Many coins bled while we pumped.

This comes as no surprise to those who hold $HEGE though, as we understand that $HEGE is criminally undervalued right not. According to this list, posted by Eric Balchunas, we were a top 15 performing meme coin of 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/qwg3redayfce1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3485b0740b9978ad8f9880bad91fefb29181b79a

What is truly remarkable about this achievement though, is our market cap has not yet reached the levels of the rest of the coins on the list. This means we have massive potential to be the top performer of 2025.

Is our potential simply just hopium? Not at all. We have over $400k raised for advertising and listings, our TikTok is continuing to explode, and we have some of the highest, if not the highest, percentage of diamond handed holders among active coins. This team is cooking and there are no plans of slowing down any time soon. We are looking to grab the bull by the horns!

It is easy for us to believe in $HEGE, because we have experienced the success and clearly see the potential, but what about you? Let me know if the comments how you feel about $HEGE. Ask any questions you might have as well. We have a whole team ready to answer any thing you throw at us."

I've used this product for years because it has zero additives or sugar. When I am near one of these places on some expedition to DC/NOVA/MD, I usually grind and buy about 4 plastic tubs. The packaging is like nothing. You pull off the lid. 

  
However because I also have a lot of dental surgery, or dental ""don't you dare do anything to stress that tooth with crunchy pnut butter"" it may sit. Sometimes it sits in my pantry tor 2+ years. 

  
It just does not spoil. The oil separates, but you can restir it in and it's fine as a spread on bread.  It dawned on me those of you sweating commercial product  shelf life might care to know this tidbit.

Got my first neighbor complaint,crows,1hvh9x3,2025-01-06 21:38:57,14,0.94,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/crows/comments/1hvh9x3/got_my_first_neighbor_complaint/,Affectionate-Goat218,,"\*Update to yesterday's post\*  
I think the murder heard the neighbor trying to discourage me. This morning it seemed like the entire murder was in my tree and nearby waiting. And their numbers doubled after I went inside. I estimated about 4 dozen total! Maybe the other person got pressured to stop, idk.

I'm new this winter to daily feeding a murder of about 2doz. at their max. Hard to see out my window, there could be more.  
I fed them this morning as usual and this afternoon I came back from an errand and one saw me and flew into my bare tree next to the driveway while I parked my car.  
I got out saying I fed them already and then 3 more landed in the tree.  
So I went in and got a small handful of peanuts in the shell to give them a snack but when I got back out there (I keep peanuts just inside my front door) they had moved back cause a neighbor that I couldn't see was walking her dog  up the block.

I saw her (haven't seen her before) and decided to continue tossing nuts on my lawn when she commented that I probably shouldn't do that x,y,z... but not in a mean way, thankfully.  
I explained it wasn't for the obese squirrels but for the crows. She then told me that a woman on the other side of the block feeds them and they've taken over the neighborhood. Peoples rain gutters are clogged with peanut shells and the dropping are a problem.  This makes sense in that lately I've been having sporadic numbers and they don't always come down to eat when I put food out.  
I thanked her for saying (always kind of a risk now days to say something) and also told her I'm also feeding them Spanish peanuts because of the shells. Now the poop isn't something I can mitigate unless I stop and I'm seeing very little droppings on my car/pavement.  
I still have a sack of peanuts in the shell that I'll keep feeding them (this neighbor isn't around when it's breakfast) till their gone and go the Spanish peanut route for as long as I can afford them.

I'm also wondering if maybe the neighbors over there hate on the crows and the crows are crapping on their stuff in retaliation? Maybe not but they are smart buggers and brighten my day. What would you do?  I want to be a good neighbor and none of my immediate neighbors have complained, so far."

[The broadcast begins with a deep, steady hum. The blue screen displays the words: ""Federal Emergency Broadcast Network – Kentucky Region,"" accompanied by the ARC logo in the corner. A calm, mechanical voice begins speaking.]

This is the Federal Emergency Broadcast Network, broadcasting on behalf of the United States government and ARC. 

The Kentucky Region FEBN remains operational and under human control.
==
[The screen transitions to a simple map of the United States, with regions marked by their FEBN statuses.]

[A red overlay dominates most areas, except for isolated blue zones representing human-operated FEBN  and a tiny minority of grey areas without operational FEBNs or failed FEBNs of mostly unimportant states; North Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma.]

The Federal Emergency Broadcast Network remains active nationwide. Four states currently retain human-operated FEBN stations:

An FEBN represent U.S military sites equipped with doomsday readiness including public broadcasting capabilities.

Allow time for your state's station to retain human control. The chaos of The Great Collapse is still unfolding. An FEBN is not a priority. It can operate on its own for months.

The following states that have retained or restored human-controlled FEBNs are;

FEBN California: Frequency 203.7 operated by the Pacific Vanguard Division (PVD).

FEBN Alaska: Frequency 122.5 operated by the Northern Frontier Survival Command.

FEBN Maine: Frequency 184.9 by the Northern Contingency Command (NCC).

Tune into each channel for more information. We are still around. We shall soon emerge again.

Other states operate automated systems or ARC-supported transmissions to ensure critical information reaches survivors.

Several U.S. satellites have been repurposed to support government remnant broadcasts. Survivors with satellite receivers can tune in to FEBN California, Alaska, or Maine for national updates. For localized guidance, remain tuned to this station.

Power remains functional across many states in the United States. Most power stations are running on their own and will fail sooner or later. 

Obtain a generator. Electricity brings many gifts such as light, television, and refrigeration. 

Collect water from rain. Make a barrel, use large garbage bags to collect rainwater.

[The broadcast begins with the ARC blue screen and the title card: Emergency Survival Training: Hunting Small Game.]

Hello, survivors. I’m Jake, and today, we’re diving into small game hunting.

Rabbits, squirrels, and other small critters are a quiet and efficient way to keep yourself fed.

We’ll go over traps, tracking, and even butchering your catch. Let’s get started.

[The screen zooms in on small paw prints in the dirt and Jake pointing to them.]

These tracks here are from a rabbit. Notice the long back feet and smaller front paws. They tend to hop in straight lines.

And here, claw marks on the tree—those are from a squirrel. Look for signs like chewed nuts or nests high up in the branches.

Tracking small game is all about paying attention to the details. Once you’ve found a good spot, it’s time to set some traps.
--
[The scene shifts to Jake setting up a snare in a small clearing.]

This is a basic snare trap. You’ll need wire or string and a sturdy stick.

Set the loop at the right height—just a few inches off the ground. Rabbits will run right into it.

[The screen transitions to Jake holding a wooden crate and demonstrating a crate trap.]

Another great option is the crate trap.

Find a sturdy box or crate, prop it up with a stick, and tie bait—like a carrot or peanut butter—to the stick.

When the animal tugs the bait, the stick falls, and the crate traps them inside.

[The camera pans to Jake setting up a box trap with a weighted lid.]

For smaller animals like squirrels, try a box trap.

It works similarly, but you’ll want to add a weight to the lid so it closes securely.

Peanuts or peanut butter make great bait for squirrels.

[The next scene shows Jake placing a premade cage trap with a spring-loaded door.]

If you come across a cage trap in a hardware store, grab it.

These are simple to use and highly effective. Just place your bait inside, and when the animal steps in, the door snaps shut.
--
[The screen transitions to Jake standing near a campfire, holding a freshly caught rabbit. The camera focuses on his hands as he speaks calmly.]

Once you’ve caught your game, it’s time to butcher it. I’ll show you the process with this rabbit.

Start by cutting a small slit in the belly, just enough to get your fingers in. Carefully remove the organs.

Be sure not to puncture the stomach or intestines. It’ll ruin the meat. Save the liver, heart, and kidneys—they’re nutritious and edible.

To skin it, make small cuts around the legs and work the hide off like peeling a glove. This hide can be used for clothing or tools later.

[The final scene shows Jake sitting by the fire, enjoying a bite of cooked rabbit.]

Cook the meat thoroughly over a steady flame to kill any bacteria. It’s simple, but it’ll keep you healthy and fed.

Hunting small game takes patience and practice, but it’s a skill that’ll keep you alive.
Stay safe out there, survivors.
--
[The broadcast ends with the ARC blue screen and the message: Survive and Prosper. Protect and Provide. Calm music fades into a mechanical voice.]

Together, we endure. Together, we rebuild. This is FEBN Kentucky. The next broadcast will begin shortly.

My hard work paid off and I now have 3 crows visit me daily. My routine is - wake up around 8 am (usually to them calling) fill up a water dish and two dishes of unshelled peanuts while making a “kiss” sound and put it on the ground. I go back inside and they swoop in. However, they seem extremely cautious, and if I open blinds or move at all they leave immediately. So, I spend lots of time “ignoring” them from inside the house, hoping to catch glimpses of them hanging out. They never stay long, maybe 20 minutes total, and they seem to dislike/take off when squirrels are around. Is it possible that they are just young and a little nervous?  Any ways to build more trust and confidence with them? "

P’Nut the squirrel can’t rest in peace in NY — his headless body held by the state as ‘evidence’  
By Matthew Sedacca	Published Dec. 7, 2024, 8:52 a.m. ET  
P'Nut, and his raccoon friend were beheaded for rabies testing.  
AP  
P’Nut can’t rest in peace.

The headless body of the world’s most famous squirrel is currently being held in a refrigerated room somewhere in upstate New York, The Post has learned.

The state Department of Environmental Conservation is preserving it as “evidence” from its agents’ harried November raid on a home in Chemung County, where they seized P’Nut the Squirrel and his raccoon pal, Fred, and then euthanized the beloved pets, according to an agency spokesperson.

The Department of Environmental Conservation raided a home before euthanizing P’Nut and Fred the raccoon.

Their heads were cut off for rabies testing, which proved neither animal was infected with the deadly disease.

The whereabouts and status of the animals’ actual noggins, meanwhile, are entirely unknown.

A state Department of Health spokesperson refused to confirm the location of their remains or whether the critters had been shipped off to the agency’s Wadsworth Center rabies lab in Slingerlands, citing pending litigation by the animals’ grieving owner, Mark Longo.  
Longo had hoped get his pets’ bodies back for a formal burial and funeral.  
He said he immediately put in a request for the remains but received only radio silence.

“We filed paperwork for it, and that’s what kind of hurt the most — they didn’t answer to it,” he said.  
Longo’s lawyer, Nora Constance Marino, said she fired off notices of preservation of evidence to the DEC and Chemung County sheriff’s office on Nov. 4, along with Elmira Animal Control and the Chemung County Health Department on Nov. 14.  
“I want and expect the bodies of Peanut and Fred, in their entirety, to be returned to my clients, even if they are in pieces,” she said.  
She said there are “evidentiary reasons” to preserve P’Nut and Fred’s corpses, but that Longo and his wife also “should be able to have the bodies of their beloved animals … for whatever sentimental sendoff they deem appropriate.”

DEC agents stormed Longo’s 350-acre property, where he and his wife run an animal sanctuary, on Oct. 30.

Officials seized P’Nut, who the couple had taken in as a household pet seven years ago after his mother was killed by a car, and recent rescue Fred.

Officials claimed P’Nut and Fred had to be euthanized for rabies tests because the squirrel bit an agent during the raid.

But, as The Post previously reported, documents show the animals had been slated for death and decapitation at least seven days before the slipshod operation, which has been widely criticized as a tragic example of government overreach.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Edward R. Rensimer previously told The Post there was “virtually zero” chance P’Nut had rabies, and said officials could have figured out whether the squirrel or raccoon had the deadly disease without killing the animals."
Why You Should Eat Your Sufficient Amount Of Protein And Fat Before Consuming Your Carbohydrates,Unimother,1hs7b1e,2025-01-02 18:04:38,3,0.8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unimother/comments/1hs7b1e/why_you_should_eat_your_sufficient_amount_of/,unimother,,"Balanced nutrition is the cornerstone of overall health, yet it seems many individuals overlook the essential roles played by protein and fat in their diets—like ignoring the fundament of building a house. By prioritizing protein and healthy fats over carbohydrates, one can enhance digestion, stabilize blood sugar levels, and improve nutrient absorption—essentially giving your body the VIP treatment it deserves. This discourse will delve into practical tips for seamlessly incorporating these macronutrients into meals, the perils of skimping on protein and fat intake, and guidance on crafting a well-rounded diet. With just a few simple dietary tweaks, one can transform their health from drab to fab!

# Key Takeaways

1. **Balanced Nutrition is Foundational**:
   1. Protein and fat are critical for overall health, acting as the ""foundation"" of the body's structure and function, much like a house's base.
   2. Prioritizing protein and healthy fats over refined carbohydrates can enhance digestion, stabilize blood sugar, and improve nutrient absorption.
2. **Protein's Vital Role**:
   1. Supports muscle repair, immune defense, hormone production, and enzymatic functions.
   2. Key sources include meats, fish, legumes, dairy, algae, and nuts.
3. **Importance of Healthy Fats**:
   1. Essential for brain function, hormone regulation, nutrient absorption (e.g., vitamins A, D, E, K), and reducing inflammation.
   2. Sources like butter, lard, olive oil, avocados, algae, and fatty fish are superior to highly processed vegetable oils, which are linked to inflammation and heart disease.
4. **Carbohydrates Are Energy Providers**:
   1. Serve as a primary energy source but should be consumed in moderation to avoid spikes in blood sugar and inflammation.
   2. Prioritize high-fiber options like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.
5. **Order of Consumption Matters**:
   1. Eating protein and fat before carbohydrates can:
      1. Prevent blood sugar spikes and crashes.
      2. Enhance satiety and regulate appetite.
      3. Improve digestion and nutrient absorption.
6. **The Perils of Skipping Protein and Fat**:
   1. Can lead to muscle loss, impaired energy levels, weight gain, and poor hormonal health.
   2. Insufficient fat intake affects brain function, vitamin absorption, and inflammatory balance.
7. **Practical Tips**:
   1. Incorporate protein and fat into meals with foods like fatty fish, nuts, seeds, avocados, butter, algae, and eggs.
   2. Avoid processed vegetable oils in favor of natural, heat-stable fats like coconut oil, lard, and ghee.
8. **Daily Requirements**:
   1. Protein: \~1.2–2.2 g/kg body weight (varies by activity level).
   2. Fat: \~20–35% of daily caloric intake, emphasizing healthy fats over omega-6-heavy vegetable oils.
9. **Risks of Vegetable Oils**:
   1. Rich in linoleic acid, which oxidizes easily during extraction and contributes to inflammation and cardiovascular risks.
   2. Opt for omega-3-rich sources like fatty fish or algae to counterbalance excess omega-6.
10. **Cholesterol is Essential**:
   1. Vital for cell membranes, hormone production, vitamin D synthesis, and brain function.
   2. Saturated fats and cholesterol from natural sources like dairy, butter, and eggs are not harmful and may lower obesity and heart disease risks.

[Optimal meal containing healthy fats, protein, fiber, and carbs.](https://preview.redd.it/bk7qe2f6wnae1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebca83d951cb35a6c897f1b80cc71f6046e5aed7)

# The Importance of Balanced Nutrition

Balanced nutrition is akin to a finely tuned orchestra, where the harmonious interplay of protein, fat, carbohydrates, and fiber creates a symphony that not only fuels our bodies but also supports our overall wellness.

It’s imperative to grasp the significance of each macronutrient in our diet, as they collectively contribute to our energy levels, muscle growth, optimal body composition, and even the elusive clarity of mind.

By employing proper nutritional strategies, one can elevate health and performance to new heights, all while neatly sidestepping the perilous pitfalls associated with poor dietary habits.

After all, why settle for a mediocre performance when you can be the conductor of your health?

# The Role of Protein, Fat, and Carbohydrates

Understanding the roles of protein, fat, and carbohydrates is akin to mastering a culinary symphony; it’s essential for optimizing our dietary balance and addressing our nutritional needs with finesse. Protein acts as the sturdy scaffolding for muscle growth and repair and plays a vital role in almost every biological process like structural support, enzymes, transportation of nutrients, immune defense, hormone regulation, cellular communication, fluid balance, blood clotting, pH balance, but also acts as an energy source and is needed to repair damaged tissue. 

Healthy fats are essential for normal brain and nervous system function, hormonal regulation, cell membrane structure, hormone production, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), skin health, and reproductive health, are needed to transport cholesterol, is anti-inflammatory, keeps you warm, provides the energy needed to power through the day and enhances flavor and texture of foods and feeling full. 

Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They serve as a primary energy source, regulate blood glucose and insulin levels, aid cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, and support fermentation. The digestive system breaks down carbohydrates into glucose for immediate energy, with excess stored in the liver and muscles for later use. This nutrient category includes sugars, fruits, vegetables, fibers, and legumes, with certain types offering the greatest benefits to the human diet.

[Your blood sugar can spike and crash from eating too many refined, low-fiber carbs. Without the fiber and the antioxidants, carbs can increase inflammation in the body.](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7827728/best-worst-carbs-for-inflammation/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20carbohydrates%20with%20added%20sugar,a%20primary%20driver%20of%20inflammation.)

These macronutrients each have their distinct roles in maintaining overall health and enhancing physical prowess.

Take protein sources like meats, legumes, and dairy; they don’t just contribute to muscle tissue construction but also lend a helping hand in post-exercise recovery. Healthy fats, found in delightful options such as fish, butter, avocados, nuts, and olive oil, are not only essential for hormone production but also play a key role in nutrient absorption. Highly processed vegetable oils like soybean, canola, corn, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut, sesame, safflower, and rice bran oil will oxidize easily after extraction and are removed from healthy micronutrients which makes them suboptimal for human consumption. These seed oils were once used as industrial oils but remarketed for human consumption.  

[With the beginning of integrating vegetable oils into our diet in the 20th century in replacement of animal fats like lard and butter](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-vegetable-and-seed-oils-bad#consumption) also [raised the amount of heart disease-related deaths. By 1960 it killed every third American.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3682614/)

[These vegetable oils are rich in Omega 6 Linoleic Acid and quickly oxidized in contact with oxygen which is different from omega 6 fats from animal sources. ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6196963/)

This paper shows:

**Rise in vegetable Omega-6 Consumption**:

* Linoleic acid intake has increased dramatically in the Western world due to the use of vegetable oils (e.g., soybean oil), making up 8–10% of total energy intake.
* This has paralleled increases in diabetes, obesity, asthma, and cardiovascular disease.

**Linoleic Acid and LDL Oxidation**:

* Linoleic acid, abundant in LDL particles, is highly susceptible to oxidation.
* Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) initiates foam cell formation, endothelial damage, inflammation, and atherosclerosis.
* The primary culprit in LDL oxidation is oxidized linoleic acid, not cholesterol itself.

**Adipose Tissue and CAD**:

* Higher linoleic acid levels in adipose tissue and platelets correlate with a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).
* In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) in platelets are inversely related to CAD.

**Competing with Omega-3**:

* Excess linoleic acid competes with alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3) for metabolism, reducing the production of protective long-chain omega-3 fatty acids like EPA and DHA.

**Clinical Evidence**:

* Studies have shown that replacing saturated fats with omega-6 linoleic acid:
   * **Increases all-cause mortality** and **cardiovascular mortality**.
   * Does not reduce the risk of heart disease despite lowering LDL cholesterol.
* Mixed omega-3/omega-6 diets were beneficial, but omega-6-only diets increased CHD risk.

**Inflammation and Oxidized Lipids**:

* Oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs) promote inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and immune cell recruitment, all of which drive atherosclerosis.

**Saturated Fat vs. Linoleic Acid**:

* Cholesterol bound to saturated fats is less prone to oxidation compared to cholesterol bound to linoleic acid.
* Consuming more linoleic acid increases the oxidation of LDL and contributes to plaque formation.

**Healthier Alternatives**:

* Replacing omega-6 vegetable oils with omega-3-rich sources (e.g., algae, fish oil) or healthier fats (e.g., omega-6 fats from animals) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Saturated Fats:

[People who reduced their saturated fat intake were just as likely to die from heart disease and other causes as those who ate more saturated fat](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8092457/).

[Consuming higher amounts of saturated fat from dairy may be associated with a reduced risk of heart disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547017/).

[The study didn’t find any connection between the total intake of saturated fat or the consumption of specific saturated fatty acids — like myristic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid — and the risk of heart disease. ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34717669/)

[Increased saturated fat intake was not associated with a higher risk of heart disease or death and was linked to lower rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure.](https://heart.bmj.com/content/108/12/932)

# Cholesterol

Cholesterol is essential for your body to work. Especially your brain relies on cholesterol for correct brain functioning.

# Key Functions of Cholesterol:

1. **Cell Membrane Structure**:
   * Cholesterol is a critical component of cell membranes, providing stability and fluidity.
   * It helps regulate the permeability of membranes, ensuring that essential nutrients enter and waste products exit the cell properly.
2. **Precursor for Hormones**:
   * Cholesterol is the building block for the synthesis of steroid hormones, including:
      * **Cortisol** (stress hormone)
      * **Aldosterone** (regulates blood pressure and fluid balance)
      * **Sex hormones** such as estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone.
   * These hormones are essential for metabolism, reproduction, and stress management.
3. **Vitamin D Production**:
   * Cholesterol in the skin is converted to **vitamin D** when exposed to sunlight. Without cholesterol, which is also a strong antioxidant, your skin can’t produce vitamin D and instead is more prone to skin cancer due to oxidative stress.
   * Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and overall well-being and is a hormone even though it is called a vitamin.
4. **Bile Production**:
   * Cholesterol is used by the liver to produce bile acids.
   * Bile is essential for digesting and absorbing dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) in the intestines.
5. **Nervous System Support**:
   * Cholesterol is a major component of the **myelin sheath**, which insulates nerve fibers and facilitates efficient transmission of electrical signals.
   * It supports brain function and is involved in synapse formation for learning and memory.
6. **Antioxidant Function**:
   * Cholesterol can act as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative damage.
7. **Immune Function**:
   * Cholesterol helps maintain immune cell membranes and supports their activity in fighting infections.
8. **Lipid Transport**:
   * Cholesterol is transported in the blood via lipoproteins (LDL, HDL, etc.) to be delivered to cells that need it for repair, growth, or hormone production.



1. **Good vs. Bad Cholesterol:**
2. **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**: Known as ""bad"" cholesterol when oxidized, it can deposit in artery walls and contribute to atherosclerosis.
3. **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)**: Known as ""good"" cholesterol, it helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and tissues, reducing cardiovascular risk.

[Dr. Uffe Ravnskov at the University of Lund, Sweden, looked at 19 existing studies that considered the association between ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol levels and the overall risk of death in people aged over 60 and concluded that 92 percent of people with a high cholesterol level lived longer, and called for a re-evaluation of the guidelines for cardiovascular prevention.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27292972/)



By emphasizing a variety of these food groups, one ensures a balanced intake, which is crucial for maintaining energy levels and promoting optimal metabolic function. After all, in the grand buffet of life, variety is the spice that keeps our nutritional plates interesting—and our bodies thriving.

# Benefits of Consuming Protein and Fat Before Carbohydrates

Indulging in protein and fat prior to carbohydrates can create quite a sophisticated ripple effect in our body's response to food. This strategic dining arrangement not only enhances digestion but also fosters more stable blood sugar levels.

By prioritizing these macronutrients, one can effectively regulate hunger signals, allowing for a longer-lasting sense of fullness. Furthermore, this method promotes superior nutrient absorption and energy distribution—key elements for effective meal planning and the pursuit of overall wellness.

Who knew that the order of our plate could hold such culinary power?

# Improved Digestion and Nutrient Absorption

Improved digestion and nutrient absorption are the delightful perks of prioritizing protein and healthy fats in our meals, enabling our bodies to make the most of the nutrients we consume. Foods rich in these macronutrients not only bolster digestive health but also enhance nutrient absorption, ensuring our bodily functions operate at peak efficiency—think of it as giving your metabolism a well-deserved raise.

Incorporating sources such as fatty meats, fatty fish, legumes, nuts, and seeds provides high-quality protein, while options like butter, lard, avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish serve up those essential healthy fats. These culinary champions play a pivotal role in stimulating the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile, effectively turning the nutrient breakdown process into a finely tuned performance.

For those seeking to elevate their meal composition for improved digestion, the art of pairing protein with fibrous vegetables and healthy fats creates a harmonious synergy, promoting a smoother digestive journey. This balanced approach not only enhances nutrient uptake but also helps maintain steady energy levels throughout the day—because who doesn't want their body to work like a well-oiled machine?

# Stable Blood Sugar Levels

Maintaining stable blood sugar levels is a notable benefit of consuming protein and fat before carbohydrates. This clever culinary strategy helps to manage insulin responses and extends energy levels throughout the day, making one feel like a well-oiled machine rather than a sluggish sloth. It also aids in appetite regulation, reducing those pesky hunger pangs while fostering a sense of satisfaction that makes snacking feel unnecessary.

By placing these macronutrients at the forefront of one’s diet, individuals can cultivate a more balanced metabolic environment, which is crucial for overall health—consider it the dietary equivalent of a well-tended garden. High-protein foods such as meats, eggs, and algae are particularly adept at slowing carbohydrate digestion, resulting in a leisurely release of glucose into the bloodstream rather than a chaotic sugar rush and a tiring sugar crash.

# Tips for Balancing Your Macronutrient Intake

Achieving a balanced macronutrient intake need not be a Herculean feat; with a sprinkle of practical tips, one can cultivate a harmonious diet that aligns seamlessly with personal lifestyle and culinary inclinations.

By embracing the right amount of proteins and fats you don’t have to apply portion control, meticulously plan meals, and pay attention to dietary patterns because you will be full just from eating those filling fats, proteins, and fibers. Individuals can optimize their nutritional intake—transforming the pursuit of better health and vitality into a delightful endeavor and enjoying every meal rather than a chore.

After all, who said balancing macros couldn’t be a walk in the park with a side of gourmet flair?

# Daily Protein and Fat Requirements

The amount of fat and protein you should eat daily depends on your personal goals, body composition, activity level, and overall health. Here's a general guide:

# Protein Requirements

Protein needs depend on your activity level and goals (e.g., muscle building, fat loss, maintenance):

1. **General Guidelines**:
   * **Sedentary**: 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (0.36 g per pound).
   * **Active**: 1.2–2.0 grams per kilogram (0.55–0.91 g per pound).
2. **Muscle Building or Strength Training**:
   * 1.6–2.2 grams per kilogram (0.73–1.0 g per pound).
3. **Fat Loss (Preserve Muscle)**:
   * 2.0–2.7 grams per kilogram (0.9–1.2 g per pound).

**Fat Requirements**

Fat intake should account for at least 20 grams daily and about 20–35% of your daily caloric intake. This range supports hormonal health, energy levels, and nutrient absorption:

1. **General Guidelines**:
   * For a **2,000-calorie diet**: 44–78 grams of fat.
   * **Active Individuals**: Stick closer to 25–30% of calories from fat.
2. **Minimum Needs**:
   * At least 0.8–1.0 grams per kilogram of body weight (0.35–0.45 g per pound).
3. **Higher Fat Diets**:
   * For ketogenic or low-carb diets: Fat can make up 60–75% of your total calories.

# Custom Calculation Example:

Let’s say you weigh 70 kg (154 lbs) and are moderately active:

1. **Protein**:
   * 1.6–2.0 g/kg = 112–140 grams of protein daily.
2. **Fat**:
   * 25–30% of a 2,500-calorie diet = 625–750 calories from fat = \~69–83 grams of fat.

# Additional Tips:

* Adjust based on your goals (e.g., more protein for muscle growth).
* Spread protein intake evenly across meals for better absorption.
* Focus on healthy fats like olive oil, avocados, nuts, butter, and fatty fish.
* Track your macronutrients, in the beginning, to get a feeling for precision if aiming for specific goals.

squirrel chews 12 foot vertical paracord,birdfeeding,1hrxqy2,2025-01-02 11:33:46,7,1.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/birdfeeding/comments/1hrxqy2/squirrel_chews_12_foot_vertical_paracord/,bvanevery,,"I think I hung my 12 foot drop lines in the spring.  They've been in service for many months without problems.  They weren't completely successful at stopping my ""champion"" squirrel, but they did slow him down.  The next step was going to be designing some kind of baffle on the line, but my ""champion"" begged off sometime in early summer.  He and his family got evicted in a beehive incident.

Well, it's winter and all the squirrels are back in force.  Today I found the peanut bearing tray on the ground.  At first I thought perhaps I hadn't tied a square knot properly yesterday when I was fiddling with it.  But nope, it was chewed off about 1 foot from its attachment point in the high crape myrtle canopy.

This is disappointing as I'd hoped / thought / imagined that the squirrels would be too off-balance to figure out a chewing attack on a vertical line.  It seems they can.  I'm guessing he hung by his rear legs to do the chewing.

Maybe my concept of off-balancing isn't wrong.  The chewing may have been situational rather than intentional.  Like the champion tried to start descending down the line, didn't like it, came back up, then got to chewing.  That's how it always seemed to go on the horizontal lines.  The squirrel never did anything like, chew the very knot tying the line to the tree.  Not smart enough for that.  But if its mouth got near something it could chew, it would chew.

Some kind of anti-chewing defense will be needed near the tree limb, at a minimum.  Like maybe a hanger made entirely of wood.  I've tried a bamboo segment jacket on the horizontal line, but the squirrel always ended up chewing between the gaps in the segments.

Maybe once there's a distance from the hanging branch, the squirrel won't have anything to hang its rear feet on.  So won't be stable enough to contemplate chewing.  That would be my hope.

In contrast, I have a long horizontal line up, deliberately trying to make a squirrel circus.  This time around, I've put no defenses on the horizontal at all.  I'm experimenting with defenses on the short 3 foot drop cords to the feeder trays.  So far they don't work; they are repurposings of earlier devices that didn't work either.  But they do cause some squirrels to fall off the lines sometimes, and that's fun to watch!

Nobody has made a chewing attack on the long horizontal line.  Which to me, may mean my understanding of squirrel psychology is on the mark.

I don't think the squirrel has made any attempt to land on the very small sunflower seed tray, which is on a 12 foot drop line.  It's a difficult target, and perhaps squirrels prefer peanuts?  They certainly eat sunflower seeds, I established that long ago.
